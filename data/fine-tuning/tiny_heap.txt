Fans built snowmen in the stands, players did snow angels on the field and all 11 members of the Colts special teams — plus some sideline personnel who were later removed from the field by officials — had to kick away piles of ankle-high snow to clear a spot for Adam Vinatieri to try the game-tying extra point late in the fourth quarter.

One point that stands out is that in what they call more selective schools, there's an expectation of going on to graduate school, and that most of the attendees have the ability to cover the costs of those degrees in the first place. Nearly forty percent of Harvard's underclassmen don't need financial aid, and Harvard costs $63,000 a year. So what about all those “useless” degrees? Even at the more selective colleges, they don't even kiss six percent of graduates: Just 5.6% of “more selective” schools had students studying visual or performing arts, for example, and the English degree that supposedly means you're jobless? Just 3.5%. English doesn't even rank in the top ten of “less selective schools.”

Douglas Ross MP: “The UK Government has delivered far less than I hoped and expected… it would be easier to get someone to drink a pint of cold sick than to try to sell this as a success.” Ross Thomson MP: “Be clear that UK national ﬁsheries resources are not negotiable and that we will therefore be setting our own ﬁsheries policy from 29 March 2019. We cannot remain party to the OFF during the proposed implementation period.” Ruth Davidson: “Having spoken to fishing leaders today, I know they're deeply frustrated with this outcome. There is no ignoring the fact that this falls short of what they had hoped for in the short-term.” Iain Duncan Smith: “There does seem to be a real concern… it appears that at least through the implementation period nothing will change, and I think that will be a concern and the government clearly has to deal with that because a lot of MPs are very uneasy about that right now.” Richard Tice, Leave Means Leave: “Under the current plans, we will not be taking back control of our fisheries when we leave the EU – something which the Government had previously promised. Ruth Davidson is absolutely right on this – our fishermen must have absolute control of our waters and fish from the end of March 2019 and anything less is totally unacceptable.” Fishing for Leave: “[David Davis] should stay in Brussels as his allegiance is obviously to the EU ring of stars not Her Majesty the Queen or the British people.” Scottish Fishermen's Federation: “It's far short of an acceptable deal – we leave the OFF and hand back sovereignty over our seas a few seconds later.”

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) – Virginia Republican Corey Stewart says he may run for U.S. Senate next year after his surprisingly strong showing in the GOP primary for governor. The former state campaign chairman for President Donald Trump said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press that his near-victory over former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie showed there's strong interest in his brand of confrontational politics. His remarks came as Republicans and Democrats alike are calling for unity and civil discourse, despite their political disagreements, after a gunman opened fire on several Republican congressmen during their baseball practice. Stewart said the harmful rhetoric is coming from Democrats and conservatives need to push back. He said he plans to take a break for a few weeks before deciding on his political future, which could include trying to challenge incumbent Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in next year's senate contest. Stewart said he will vote for the Republican ticket in this year's elections, but won't actively support Gillespie unless he becomes a “fighter” for Trump and against illegal immigration and the removal of Confederate statues.

GRAND MANAN, N.B. — At least 10 Canadian fishing boats from New Brunswick have been intercepted by U.S. Border Patrol agents since last week while fishing in the disputed waters around Machias Seal Island, a spokesman for the fishermen says.
Machias Seal Island, which is about 19 kilometres southwest of Grand Manan Island and east of Maine, is in a disputed area known as the Grey Zone, where lobster fishermen from both Canada and the United States have long fished side by side.
As lucrative lobster catches have increased in the zone, competition between fishermen has intensified.
Spokesman John Babcock said the Canadian government is also talking with U.S. agencies, though he did not provide details about the fishermen's allegations or Ottawa's response.
“We understand that a few Grand Manan fishermen were approached by the United State Border Services during the month of June. Our understanding is that this was a part of a regular exercise being conducted along the U.S. marine border.”

Given the fact that we're still a long way from either the 2018 or 2020 elections, it's arguably the case that these early poll numbers don't mean all that much, Outside of a handful of Special Elections, including one tomorrow in Georgia that is likely to result in a runoff between the Democratic candidate and which ever of the large number of Republicans also running for the seat, there's not likely to be much political impact from Trump's low job approval numbers or from the fact that the GOP is sliding in the polls itself. It's also worth noting that the Pew Research poll from which these numbers come also show that public approval for the Democrats has fallen over the same time period from from 51% in January to 45% today. Nonetheless, the fact that Republicans are falling behind on key issues doesn't bode well for their ability to get matters through Congress notwithstanding the fact that they control Congress. Additionally, if Republicans in the House and Senate begin to perceive that close association with Trump could potentially have an impact on their own reelection chances in the midterms which are just over eighteen months away, they could start striking out on their own and assert independence from the White House in ways that make it all the more difficult for a White House that has already been shown to have trouble getting its agenda through Congress to get what it wants out of Capitol Hill. In the end, the Congressmen and Senators up for reelection then are going to act in what they believe is their self-interest regardless of what the White House says or what the President sends out during own of his traditional Twitter tirades, and that could make life in Washington even more unpleasant for the 45th President.

SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Actress and author Carrie Fisher wrote three autobiographies. Speed skating Olympics star Apolo Anton Ohno published his autobiography at age 20. The rascal occultist Aleister Crowley produced an “autohagiography.” To understand that odd term, keep in mind that “hagiography” is an account of the life of a saint, so adding “auto” means it's the biography of a saint penned by the saint himself. I'm bringing up these fun facts in hope of encouraging you to ruminate at length on your life story. If you don't have time to write a whole book, please take a few hours to remember in detail the gloriously twisty path you have trod from birth until now. According to my reading of the astrological omens, the best way to heal what needs to be healed is to steep yourself in a detailed meditation on the history of your mysterious destiny.

Honestly, there's no way this was ever going to play out well. Let's go over it together: You were watching trailblazing Boston hardcore greats Converge play a packed show in Berkeley on Tuesday night, and you decided to get up onstage. That's normal; it happens at hardcore shows all the time. But then you walked up to legendarily intense frontman Jacob Bannon, put your arm over his shoulder, and paused for a mid-song selfie. Did you really think this out? Because here's what happened: The band stopped playing, and the entire crowd booed you. Then, when they started up again, you tried to dive into the crowd, and nobody caught you. And as Alternative Press points out, someone caught the whole thing on video, so that the rest of us could bear witness to your pain and humiliation. Here, watch:

The survey states that Antrix Corporation – the commercial arm of ISRO – foresees greater utilisation of rockets like PSLV, GSLV-MkII and GSLV MkIII by the international community for launching their Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. In the case of satellite launching, as on March 2017, PSLV successfully launched 254 satellites. Foreign exchange earnings of India from the export of satellite launch services increased noticeably in 2015-16 and 2016-17 to Rs 394 crore and Rs 275 crore from Rs 149 crore in 2014-15. In a recent interview with IANS, ISRO Chairman K.

Killers frontman Brandon Flowers took the opportunity to reveal himself as an mega Liam fan. “We heard you missed out on a couple of songs you wanted to hear,” he said. “Before I sing this song I would first like to say that Liam Gallagher is my king, is one of my kings.” If Flowers strikes you as the kind of person who knows “Wonderwall” so well he can vocalize the piano solo off the shiny silver cuff, you'd be right.

If the Cowboys had the identical offensive line, of course. They still have a plethora of Pro Bowl linemen. But the injury, free agent, and retirement bugs have wide wings, from Wisconsin and Texas.

A sad day indeed. The shooting sending shock waves through the capitol right here behind me. We saw security tighter than ever. In the hallways and meeting rooms today, members of congress has the rhetoric gone too far. Where are we now as a nation? ABC's Mary Bruce also here on capitol hill. Reporter: Congressman Steve Scalise was looking forward to the big game. I couldn't even make my high school team. But, you know, kind of bloomed later in life. Reporter: The Louisiana lawmaker, a proud Ragin' cajuns fan, calling his wife before heading into surgery. Also hit, Zack Barth, a congressional aide from Texas. Posting that he was in the hospital but "Okay." And lobbyist Matt Mika, one of the team's coaches, shot in the chest. Tonight in critical condition. And those two heroic officers, crystal Griner, shot in the ankle. And David Bailey, a nine-year veteran of the capitol police, suffering minor injuries. Both there to protect Scalise, but protecting so many more. Scalise gets a security because he's in leadership. Had Scalise not been there I think it would have been a massacre today because there would have been no way to defend yourself. Reporter: Congressman Rodney Davis of Illinois, the team's catcher, was at bat when shots rang out. We show him the shooter's photo. It makes me nauseous to find out he may be from my home state. The hate just over political differences has ratcheted up to where it becomes entertainment value, and that has to stop. It's my breaking point. I'm going to do everything I can to make it stop. Reporter: And today moments of unity. That image in the dugout, the democratic team praying for the Republican colleagues, and in the halls of congress. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. Mary, both we heard that often today. So many here on capitol hill do believe we have reached a breaking point with the rhetoric in this country. You've learned that the congressional baseball game will go on tomorrow. David, that show of unity will extend to the baseball diamond tomorrow night. Democrats and Republicans feel it sends a strong message that Americans will not back down to fear. One Republican at that field today, they all agree they need to play ball. David. Mary Bruce just behind us at the capitol.

The research could bring some significant changes to photo editing if the tool makes its way into an image editor. Nvidia's program, for example, could replace an eye in an old, damaged portrait, even without the other eye to replicate. The resulting eye, of course, isn't the same eye — in one example, the replaced eye is an entirely different color. In the demonstration video, the program also appears to give a young woman and an older gentleman the same pair of eyes.

Dylan Hatfield got one last chance to see his brother and five other crewmen on the Destination, a 98-foot crab boat missing and presumed sunk in the Bering Sea.
Commercial fishing is inherently dangerous, and crab fishing in the Bering Sea is notoriously so. Fishermen work winters in icy, heaving platforms handling heavy, unforgiving equipment.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health notes that fishermen drop crab pots, each weighing 750 to 850 pounds empty, rigged to hundreds of feet of coiled line and buoys used to recover them from the ocean bottom.
The vessel owners, F/V Destination, Inc., have not released name of the six crewmen. Spokesman Mike Barcott said the company has not contacted all families to make sure they want the names public.

As satisfying as “The Man” is when it comes to packing a big “Fame” glitter wallop, it's not exactly something you'll find yourself searching for deep-seated meaning in—which is why, based on the teaser photos, I hold out hope for a video outrageous enough to confirm that the Killers are in on the joke.

Miami ended the period with an offensive zone cycle. Senior defenseman Louie Belpedio shot from WMU's blue line through traffic, and the rebound popped up to where it looked like the puck had gone in, but the period would remain scoreless. Miami's efforts were realized on its 8-7 shot advantage over Western.
Miami controlled much of the second, as Western Michigan wouldn't take their first shot of the period until eight minutes into the frame. A 5-on-3 advantage for the Broncos proved to be the spark the team needed. After a WMU timeout, junior defenseman Corey Schueneman's shot from the left point beat Larkin top shelf. The goal at 9:42 cut Miami's lead to 2-1.
Another slew of penalties led to a Miami 5-on-3 advantage and Hutton's 10th goal of the season.

New York sent second baseman Starlin Castro and a pair of minor leaguers to the Marlins for the NL MVP, also giving up right-hander Jorge Guzman and infielder Jose Devers. The Yankees became just the fourth team in big league history with the reigning home run champions in each league, joining Hank Greenberg and Ralph Kiner of the 1947 Pirates, Joe DiMaggio and Johnny Mize of the 1949 Yankees, and Mike Schmidt and Dick Allen of the 1975 Phillies.
Why do they want him? The Golden Knights added centre Paul Stastny in free agency, but the team's big weak spot is on the backend. That is, unless you believe Nate Schmidt is a legitimate No. 1 defenceman who is capable of logging 25 minutes a night.
What can they offer? Vegas didn't have a first-round selection in this year's draft, but they did have three high picks in 2017. Ottawa will want one of them, whether it's centre Cody Glass (sixth), winger Nick Suzuki (13th) or defenceman Erik Brannstrom (15th). Toss in Shea Theodore or winger Alex Tuch — both are 22 — and next year's first-round pick and you could have a deal.
Why do they want him? The Sharks missed out on Tavares, but Karlsson is the rare defenceman who could put up just as many points as the Leafs centre — more if he sees time on the power play with Burns, who has scored 68 goals in the past three years.
What can they offer? San Jose will not want to give up 24-year-old Tomas Hertl, who just signed a four-year deal worth $22.5 million, while Evander Kane, Logan Couture and Joe Pavelski all have no-trade clauses. So look for the Sharks to dangle 21-year-old Timo Meier, who scored 21 goals last season, as well as prospects such as 2018 first-round pick Ryan Merkley, an offensive defenceman with a Karlsson-esque skill-set.
What can they offer? Miro Heiskanen, who was selected third overall in 2017, would have to be the centrepiece of any deal. He might be the only piece. Then again, Ottawa's insistence on acquiring him could end up being a deal-breaker. That's how highly regarded the Finnish defenceman is as a prospect.
What can they offer? Any deal would have to include 20-year-old defenceman Mikhail Sergachev, who had 40 points in his rookie season. But with Nikita Kucherov and Brayden Point needing new contracts next summer, you have to wonder if one of them gets dangled instead.

“He always had very good feet for his size and that's something I look for in all athletes but in particular the linemen, the footwork," Stefanelli said. "He had great feet. He was going to be able to be a very good pass blocker. That's always a concern with big high school linemen because they get to college and they have to be able to really move and get out in space especially against zone schemes and especially in pass protection. You have that innately and then can you just develop your body, as he did?

Indigenous Congressman Amilcar Pop said the use of floggings is increasingly discouraged, however.
Huntsman was the founder and longtime executive chairman of the $11 billion company that refines raw materials that go into thousands of products. He was also the father of Jon Huntsman Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Russia and former Utah governor, presidential candidate and ambassador to China and Singapore.
In 1970, Huntsman founded the Huntsman Container Corp., which focused on food packaging and pioneered the clamshell container used for McDonald's Corp.'s Big Mac hamburger. He formed Huntsman Chemical Corp. in 1982 and more than a decade later, consolidated his companies as Huntsman Corp., producing materials used in a wide range of products, from textiles and paints to plastics and aviation components.
Huntsman stepped down from his role in December and his son Peter Huntsman took over as the company's leader. His father continued to serve on the company's board of director and was named chairman emeritus.
He also wielded his power as a billionaire benefactor to the center. After the cancer institute's director and CEO was fired in April 2017, Huntsman mounted a public campaign criticizing leaders of the university and took out full-age newspaper advertisements calling the officials "inept and uncaring." The director and CEO was reinstated a week after her firing and the school's health care leader and president stepped down.
Huntsman was a special assistant to President Richard Nixon and briefly ran his own 1988 campaign for Utah's governor.
Huntsman later served as a finance chairman for Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential bid and in 2012, worked for his son's presidential bid, giving more than $1.8 million to a super PAC supporting the younger Huntsman.
Following his son's short-lived race for the Republican nomination, Huntsman kept a toehold in Utah current affairs, occasionally offering political commentary to Utah newspapers and even expressing an interest in purchasing The Salt Lake Tribune.
In the 1980s, Huntsman explored purchasing the Tribune's competitor, the Mormon-church owned Deseret News. He met with high-level leaders with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but faith leaders did not want to pursue the offer, Huntsman wrote in his autobiography.
A committed member of the Mormon church, Huntsman served in several high-level leadership positions with the faith and had close friendships with the past five church presidents.
Huntsman said the family was exposed to the dark side of wealth and fame in 1987, when his then-16-year-old son James Huntsman was kidnapped at knifepoint from his driveway. The teenager was forced to call his father to arrange payment of $1 million ransom. He was later rescued by FBI agents.
Huntsman was born in 1937 in Blackfoot, Idaho and later moved to California, where he met his wife Karen while in junior high there.
Huntsman is survived by his wife and eight children. One daughter, Kathleen Ann Huntsman, died in 2010 at age 44 after struggling for years with an eating disorder.

Although the EFCC said they were there to enforce a 10-year old Interim Order of Forfeiture on the shareholding of Sun Newspapers, the Editors of the Sun Newspapers said the EFCC officials were there on a vengeance and intimidation mission to settle scores on several stories published by the newspaper, including the alleged ownership of certain properties by the wife of the EFCC Acting Chairman for which the Acting Chairman had threatened libel lawsuits. Instead of lawsuits, the EFCC operatives raided the newspaper offices to revive a 10-year old Interim Order of Forfeiture that is already before an appellate court.
The Orioles soon will be at a crossroads – they could lose right-hander Chris Tillman to free agency after this season and third baseman Manny Machado, center fielder Adam Jones and closer Zach Britton after 2018.
Duquette is correct about the makeup of the Orioles' major-league roster – 12 of their current 25 players are homegrown if you include outfielder Hyun Soo Kim, a free agent from Korea. Seven of those, however, already were in the organization when Duquette took over in Nov. 2011, including Machado, second baseman Jonathan Schoop and right-hander Dylan Bundy.
The Blue Jays, at 2-10, already look like a likely seller. Neither right-hander Aaron Sanchez (blister) and lefty J.A. Happ (elbow) is expected to be out long, but third baseman Josh Donaldson likely will miss 2 to 4 weeks due to his latest calf issue, sources said.

McGriff was also a part of (in)arguably the biggest trade in Blue Jays history in 1990. The Blue Jays sent their star first baseman and shortstop Tony Fernandez to the San Diego Padres in exchange for second baseman Roberto Alomar, and outfielder Joe Carter. For as good as McGriff and Fernandez both went on to be, it's hard to argue that things didn't work out for Toronto.

The Igbo have been a great credit to Nigeria. They have given us a great number of our favourite sons, including international statesman Nnamdi Azikiwe; military leader Odumegwu Ojukwu; regional leader Michael Okpara; vice-president Alex Ekwueme; mathematical genius Chike Obi; literary icon Chinua Achebe; world-class economist Pius Okigbo; world boxing champion Dick Tiger; international statesman Emeka Anyaoku; and world-class artist Ben Enwonwu.

It's hard to disagree with Ellis. It's essentially gamesmanship – and perhaps referees can instead penalise attacking teams for doing it so blatantly to try and win a penalty and get easy points if they believe that's the case? Apparently, one Super League coach warned his side off doing it following the opening weekend. Hopefully it can be clamped down upon sooner rather than later – although we'll see on Thursday with Huddersfield's clash against Salford whether anything has changed.

Though the Lions have lost three-straight coming into the playoffs, this is an intriguing affair.

By the time he saw that first pitch, the Yankees had tied the score at 1-1, ensuring Luis Severino wouldn't be tagged with a loss after allowing just one hit and three walks in seven innings, on an eighth-inning rally during which Matt Holliday pinch-hit for starting first baseman Greg Bird against lefty reliever Alex Claudio and singled. Austin had received a heads-up from Girardi and bench coach Rob Thomson that if Bird got lifted for a pinch-hitter, he would enter the game at first base.
That focus seems to be on forechecking the slower Rangers defensemen and letting goaltender Carey Price see as many shots as possible. Since Mats Zuccarello's goal with 5:13 remaining in the second period of Game 2, Price has stopped 41 of 42 shots with his teammates limiting high-danger chances.

He'll be sporting a custom Elevee suit Thursday in Dallas, where he hopes to hear his name called during the first round of the NFL draft.

“When explaining his relationship with Saban, Kiffin points to the development of three consecutive SEC offensive players of the year—receiver Amari Cooper (2014), tailback Derrick Henry (2015) and quarterback Jalen Hurts (2016). Kiffin believes that offensive success has changed Alabama's recruiting paradigm. He points out that Julio Jones, an elite NFL receiver, caught 78 balls his final year at Alabama in 2010. Cooper caught 124, which is what Kiffin says attracted Calvin Ridley to Tuscaloosa from South Florida. He points out that Derrick Henry's Heisman season helped lure star freshmen tailbacks B.J. Emmons and Joshua Jacobs. And Hurts's success this season helped make the Tide more attractive to quarterback recruits. ‘He's always been able to go sign any defensive player in America, but he'd struggled to sign the national five-star quarterback,' Kiffin says. ‘Now that's different.'”
Enter Kiffin, who was fresh off being awkwardly dismissed from yet another head coaching job at USC. He installed a more creative offense that still relied on pro-style concepts. Kiffin could attract the skill players who wanted to play in a fast, high-scoring offense while also luring the massive offensive lineman who wanted a chance to prove to NFL teams they could execute pro-style assignments. And Kiffin meshed those two philosophies perfectly, as the Tide now run one of the more dynamic offenses in the SEC.
And this is how Kocurek wants the Miami defensive lineman to approach practices and games this year:
The first thing is the Dolphins want their linemen to attack more. That's interesting because I thought that was the intent all along.
The second thing is the Dolphins want to borrow from the Jacksonville Jaguars' philosophy of rolling linemen in and out in waves — hoping that fresh backups getting important snaps is better than starters getting extended playing time, even when they might be winded.
The killing of Godwin, a father and grandfather, is reminiscent of the slayings of two TV journalists in 2015.

In Congress, repeal of much of the ACA is imminent. Oregon Congressman Greg Walden, incoming chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is working on a timeline for repealing major provisions of the health care law, including the expansion of Medicaid. In the absence of repeal, Congress should consider an enrollment freeze approach. A freeze would halt new enrollment while allowing current enrollees to stay in the program until their incomes climb above eligibility limits. It would be an intermediate step towards repeal with immediate benefits for taxpayers and current enrollees.

She underscores that she was privileged to be given that opportunity, adding that now, in the next chapter of her life, she will dedicate herself to other causes, among them Jewish identity and continuity. She will also seek ways in which to make Israel more relevant and meaningful to Jews everywhere.Beginning in July, the foundation's board of directors in Jerusalem will begin searching for a successor to fill the void being left by Arbib-Perugia, who previously made a name for herself in the world of Jewish philanthropy through her activities in Keren Hayesod in her native Italy and on a global basis.She leaves the Jerusalem Foundation in a glow of appreciative comments made by many of the people with whom she worked closely.Chairman of the board David Brodet noted that she had come to the foundation with a breadth of fund-raising capabilities and experience, and said the foundation had undoubtedly benefited from her knowledge.International chairman Sallai Meridor praised her “tremendous commitment,” emphasizing that she had steered the foundation through a very successful 50th anniversary campaign. He credited her with “remarkable fund-raising achievements” and for revitalizing the foundation's senior leadership both in Israel and overseas.Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said, “Her leadership and contributions to the city will surely be felt for decades to come.”Arbib-Perugia, who has been mentioned as a possible successor to Jewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky, said that she was satisfied with the accomplishments of the Jerusalem Foundation, and that she was leaving with a personal sense of fulfillment for all that she and her team have achieved together.Speaking of the overall advancement of the foundation, she said: “We have a new strategic direction, a list of innovative and interesting projects that we believe will impact on the city for many years, and a well-entrenched new senior leadership team in Israel poised to steer the foundation in new directions. We continue to strengthen our relationships with long-standing donors while connecting with the younger generation.”What gives her the greatest satisfaction is that during the three years of her tenure, the foundation has achieved all its fund-raising goals.A full interview with Arbib-Perugia will be published in Friday's Jerusalem Post.

Not Easy To Work With Two Actresses A source told Bollywood Life, "Everyone is aware that working with two heroines that too A-Lister's is not easy for any actor.'' SRK Is Friendly With Them ''Shahrukh Khan has worked with them before and is friendly with them.'' The Big Question ''Like every two-heroine project, there are questions about how much screen space Katrina or Anushka will share with the actor.'' This Is The Reason ''The two (SRK and Rai) have decided not to fuel any such speculations by adopting a simple method. The superstar is not getting any pictures clicked with either of them." Their Strategy "SRK and Rai are very much aware of this and have taken this step.'' No Actress Can Claim This ''No actress' team can get an upper hand and say that she has the bigger role," added the source.

LIGA Chairman of the Board, Aric Simons, states, "Earth Revival is truly composed of some of the greatest minds in sustainability -- from healthy buildings to groundbreaking medical and well-being treatments and innovative, superior building products. LIGA is primarily responsible for real estate development and construction, but each Division of the Company works symbiotically with each other. For example, LIGA is already selling products that are developed and produced by the Health Products Division. Also, while Medical personnel will administer stem cell treatments, LIGA will construct health centers that ensure a safe environment most conducive for recovery and healing. Earth Revival utilizes state-of-the-art technology developed by doctors, scientists and environmentalists who care about more than just profit -- they care about the planet and the people who inhabit it. As proof, a portion of all net profits will be donated to Charitable Organizations dedicated to the promotion of environmental and wellness causes. That said, we expect the venture to be extraordinarily profitable and the early feedback supports this conclusion. LIGA is excited and honored to be associated with Earth Revival and its fellow Members."

With 3:17 remaining in the Chicago Blackhawks' 5-4 loss to St. Louis on Sunday, Artem Anisimov slid the puck to Brent Seabrook, and the big defenseman unleashed a shot that bounced off Tomas Jurco and right back to Anisimov.
"It's hard to figure out, definitely," Anisimov said. "Sometimes you can have 3 assists in a game and it's all going to be second(ary) assists. Like you win the faceoff and a defenseman chips the puck out of our zone, and a guy scores 2-on-1.

Last Monday in this space, we recommended fantasy baseball team owners drop catcher/first baseman Alex Avila after his trade from the Detroit Tigers to the Chicago Cubs. Then, the defending World Series champions suddenly lose their top catcher to an injury a few days later, and Avila suddenly has fantasy relevancy once again. It's a tough world to stay on top of for six months straight, isn't it?

With Bagley in the mix, Duke — who are, as of this posting, my pick to land the 6-foot-11 forward — would have a very strong case to be slotted as the preseason No. 1 team in the country. Given the way that last season went, that may not go over all that well, but there's a valid argument: The Blue Devils would start three freshmen — Bagley, Trevon Duval and Wendell Carter — that are top seven prospects in the class, according to 247 Sports composite rankings, and another who would be the No. 17 player in the class in Gary Trent Jr. They finally have a point guard to replace Tyus Jones in the for of Duval. Grayson Allen, the lone returnee from last year's team, is finally healthy, according to Mike Krzyzewski, and on paper is a veteran leader and an all-american caliber player.
Youth would be a major issue, as Allen would likely be the only rotation player that is an upperclassman. Depth is going to be another problem as well, as Duke's reserves will likely be made up of some combination of freshmen Alex O'Connell and Jordan Tucker and sophomore Marques Bolden and Javin DeLaurier.
Selectman Jordan Collyer told Stone during the presentation, “This is a great accomplishment … you've been a tremendous hire for us.” He shared that the Council on Aging and others in the community “…love having you available to help,” and added, “We've made your role bigger, especially in a community with a population averaging over the age of fifty-five.”
The selectmen also met with Treasurer Brenda Herbeck and Town Clerk Catherine Heuberger to sign documents for short-term notes and bonds. The retiring bonds earned up to $271,000, and those monies will be used to pay down other debts. The earnings were from bonds that were taken for school and library improvements between 2007 and 2009.

For many fans old enough to remember the 1969 Cubs, Beckert was our guy. Actor Joel Murray, a brother of Bill Murray, says he was a Beckert guy. A second baseman for most of my baseball-playing days, I was such a Beckert fan that I successfully lobbied my high school baseball coach to give me Beckert's No. 18. My first computer password at the Daily Herald was Beckert, I once traded a Ken Griffey Jr. rookie baseball card for a Beckert rookie card, and a Beckert baseball card still occupies a spot in my newsroom cubicle.
Beckert, 24, started the 1965 season as the Cubs' second baseman and held down that spot until he was traded to the San Diego Padres before the 1974 season. He rarely belted homers, hardly ever struck out, hit .342 in 1971 and won a Gold Glove for his fielding in 1968.
CB Medical Chairman of the Board, Dr. Kenneth Perego, MD, adds, "We are excited to have American Cannabis Company as our long-term partner for the LSU project.

In particular, we were impressed by their proprietary cultivation methods and their past experience with projects similar to this one. This is the right group to help us produce pharmaceutical-grade medicine at our production facility."

Morris is a 2020 prospect, but he was arguably the most athletic offensive lineman there. He has great agility, he showed good reaction speed and he has good length. He may not have elite height, but he almost checks every box for a top tackle prospect.
Lucas was nasty. Some thought the Florida State commit played a little dirty and kept going after the whistle blew, but you cannot deny his success in Atlanta. He was stoning defensive linemen on a regular basis and he could be a top guard in the ACC down the road.
Bradford had to work on both sides of the ball due to the lack of interior defensive linemen on his team. He had success on both sides and won some key battles on his team at defensive tackle. The LSU commit is naturally strong and was tough to move once he got his hands on defensive linemen.
Rogers may have been the most consistent offensive lineman in the group. He looks like a guard and is ranked as one on Rivals.com, but he played right tackle and showed good feet, balance and patience.

Ocean's Eleven had George Clooney emerging from prison in the rumpled tuxedo he was arrested in. Even in the context of the effortlessly hip universe of globe-trotting miscreants the 2001 film set forth, it was a cool look. That look established his character, Danny Ocean, as a gentleman crook — smart and suave and pewter-haired, stealing from the rich to give to himself and his friends because they'll just be so much better at spending money than the assholes they're taking it from. Steven Soderbergh, who directed the Ocean's trilogy and who returns from a four-year retirement from filmmaking to bookend it with the equally jubilant new heist comedy Logan Lucky, is a savant when it comes to understanding the appeal of his lead actors. He constructed his fantasy of a community of hypercompetent thieves around Clooney's matinee-idol aura — con men as movie stars, or vice versa. We want Danny to win not because he was wronged in some way, but because he feels he's too suave and too smart to have to submit to the indignities of a daily grind, and Clooney sells us on the fact that Danny's right.

At his best, Farhadi ensures that every twist of narrative is matched by a revelation of character — and something more: a startling, laserlike insight into the particular social and cultural environs that shaped these characters and their reasons for reacting the way they do. The world of The Salesman isn't quite as intricately imagined as some of its predecessors, and the story's sleuthing element, while absorbing, often feels more narratively expedient than germane.
Me: According to Rangers officials, there is no consideration of Ibanez as an outfielder. The Rangers are happy with his work at second and third. The rise of Isiah Kiner-Falefa could eventually force that long-term, but for now, I think the Rangers want to keep him where is most natural and comfortable. Remember, Ibanez was considered an excellent defensive second baseman when the Rangers signed him out of Cuba.
In the space of less than a month at the start of 1968, 58 fishermen based in the English port of Hull lost their lives in three separate trawler sinkings. Thanks to the efforts of a group of determined women, the deaths would change the industry, with the ripples spreading from the Arctic Sea to the steps of Downing Street.
The attitudes of fishermen - perhaps today they would be described as macho - were also perhaps a barrier to changes to the industry.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Did the rewards on offer to fishermen make the risk worthwhile?
But as it turned out, the tireless work of the Headscarf Revolutionaries made the lives of fishermen safer just as Hull was losing its status as a bustling fishing port.
A maritime city that relied on the wealth brought to shore by the "three-day millionaires" - a term coined to describe the short-term spoils enjoyed by the fishermen as a result of their weeks at sea - was already past its trawler heyday by 1968.

In response to the arrests, Hassan Nasrallah accused Cairo of mistreating the Palestinians after the 2008 War in Gaza. He lamented the closing of the Rafah crossing that, the Chairman of the Party said, made Egypt a “partner in the killing of Palestinians by the Israeli Defense Forces”, a declaration that angered Cairo.

The track is the first new music from the band since their 2012 album Battle Born (assuming you don't count their 2016 Christmas album Don't Waste Your Wishes). Hopefully, this signals a fifth studio effort is imminent. “The Man” was recorded with the producer Jacknife Lee during album sessions in Las Vegas and Los Angeles. The song finds frontman Brandon Flowers looking back on his younger self, the persona from their Grammy-nominated debut Hot Fuss, and reconciling that wide-eyed character with the man he is now.

Today's special election in Arizona's 8th district to replace Congressman Trent Franks hasn't garnered nearly the attention of the other high-profile races of the past year. That's understandable, as the odds of Republicans keeping the seat seem, outwardly, very good.

Fall In Love With Nature Escaping into a tropical paradise or admiring the majesty of a mountain peak can make you feel small in the best way. Nature has a way of taking you out of the chatter of your mind and into the present moment. For those who live coastal, make sure you take some time today to sit at the beach and let yourself be in awe of creation. For those who live in wintery states, plan a weekend ski trip—even if you aren't a skier you can always snow tube, take a frozen waterfall hike, or ice skate. Fall In Love With Sisterhood In the epic words of Toni Morrison, ‘She is a friend of my mind. She gathers me, man. The pieces I am, she gathers them and give them back to me in all the right order.' We often take our sister girlfriends for granted, but they are some of our first teachers of unconditional love. How many people in your life can you say loves you when you are at your ugliest and bitchiest and when you are at your best? Go to dinner with your best friend today—order a bottle of wine and have the best date of your life with someone who truly knows and loves you no matter what life throws your way. Fall In Love With Brotherhood God bless our guy friends (the real ones, not the ones you hook up with periodically when you're lonely or bored.) I'm talking about the men who have been rocking with you since high school/college. The guys who will remind you what a catch you are when the new guy in your life makes his exit. Having your best guys around offer you perspective, not only into the inner workings of man thinking, but also, it reminds you of how you deserve to be treated. Fall In Love With Yourself Of everyone who comes in and out of your life there is one consistent—you. This one may be the most cliche but it's also the most crucial. Go ahead and put post-it notes all around your mirror with love letters to yourself. Make your own damn romantic bath with roses and candles and relax in the tub. Sleep naked. Make love to yourself (we have some tips for you here.) Somewhere in our development, we were told sensuality lies within the realm of relationship and partnership, but the ability to really comfort yourself and feel intimacy with your own naked body is priceless. Fall In Love With Learning Elizabeth Gilbert (Author of Eat, Pray, Love) said in an interview with Oprah, “If I had spent less time worrying about my love life, I could've been fluent in mandarin Chinese by now.” We can't stop expanding and opening our minds to new knowledge. This is the time to pick up a new hobby–whether it's soap making, learning a new language, learning the origins of various wines, or learning to play a new instrument, enhancing your life with knew knowledge makes you love your life even more.

"He said that if the planned fire of power demonstration is carried out as the US is going more reckless, it will be the most delightful historic moment when the Hwasong artillerymen will wring the windpipes of the Yankees and point daggers at their necks, underlining the need to be always ready for launching to go into action anytime once our Party decides," the report said.

The last ones that played around here were the Cowboys of the '90s. The Stars and Mavericks have captured titles more recently, but there was no sustained success in either case. When the "Triplets" grabbed three Lombardi Trophies in four years, they were rivaling (at that moment) the dominance that Michael Jordan and the Bulls were demonstrating in Chicago.

So will $16 billion be enough? Some analysts said that may not be the case even if HNA raises enough cash to cover its immediate debt and that the government's scrutiny of high-profile dealmakers may also drive disposals. Anbang former Chairman Wu Xiaohui is waiting for a court ruling on charges fraudulent fundraising and the government is said to be preparing the sale of some of the insurer's assets. CEFC, which last year agreed to buy a $9 billion stake in Russian state energy giant Rosneft PJSC, has also been facing mounting government pressure.

The Orioles placed slugging first baseman Chris Davis on the 10-day disabled list because of a strained right oblique. Davis - batting .226 with 14 homers and 26 RBIs - exited Monday's loss to Chicago.

Not My Problem: SSR Commenting on his rude behaviour, he said, "People are constantly finding ways to explain how I've continued to survive in the industry. That's their problem, not mine." I Have No Plans Of Living A Rat Life "I'm not trying to prove a point, I'm not in the race to be No. 1 because I have no plans of living a rat's life. I'm not obsessed with the future and at the same time I'm neither hiding something nor trying to earn a particular reputation," said Sushant. Sushant On His Affair With Kriti "Sometimes, there is a series of stories about me which are untrue and I feel misunderstood. That's not a great feeling." The Stories Do Affect Me: SSR "As an actor I can condition myself to ignore the rumours, but I hold on to the vulnerability and the emotions these rumours evoke because it makes me a better actor. The stories often affect me but they never change my friendship with any co-star," said Sushant. Sushant On Raabta Debacle "We view life as a cause-and-effect-theory. If a film doesn't work we try to find reasons and add to our disillusionment. I've read every book on what's necessary to write a great script and make a hit film." SSR Is Indeed A Positive Thinker "They clearly haven't helped. So now, I've conditioned myself in a way that no matter what happens on Friday, I'll be okay on Monday. I can't screw up six months of work on my next by thinking of my last film," said the Kai Po Che actor. SSR On His First GF "My first girlfriend dumped me because I was too boring. I've tried to be more interesting ever since," said Sushant. SSR On Working With Sara On the work front, Sushant will be next seen in Kedarnath, opposite Amrita Singh's daughter, Sara Ali Khan. In the same interview, when SSR was asked if Amrita is interfering too much with her daughter's Bollywood debut, Sushant said, "Untrue, the script hasn't changed a bit from the one I was given and said ‘yes' to the first time."
With sluggers Yoenis Cespedes and Michael Conforto on the bench to begin the game, the resurgent Mets came back from a 4-1 deficit and took two of three from the defending World Series champions despite losing second baseman Neil Walker to a left leg injury.

Question: With Montgomery and Adams banged up, is this the best time the Cowboys D could have caught Rodgers and Co.?
None of us really knows any of those answers. We do know that, other than being fine athletic specimens who are great at beating people up, Mayweather and McGregor are also showmen and wildly gifted salesmen, their tongues almost as sharp as their punches. There's a reason this fight had more public than pugilistic appeal. One thing – perhaps the only thing – Mayweather and McGregor have in common is that just as many folks tune in to see them lose as to watch them win.

7. The so-called National Convention of the APC was even worse. The National Convention of the party was ridiculed with constitutional infirmities that were so glaring and obvious that no fair minded person can claim that a legitimate and lawful executive emerged from that process. The Chairman of the organising Committee, Jigawa State Governor, His Excellency, Alhaji Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, declared 18 seats unopposed and uncontested, since only one valid candidate stood at the end of the grossly manipulated nomination exercise for each of the offices. He therefore proceeded to declare them duly elected in flagrant abuse and violence to the Constitution of the APC.
It may well be that it the convention Chairman put the “No” Question, the voice vote for the “Noes”, may have been more. We will never know, since it was never done, contrary to the express provisions of the APC Constitution. It is therefore unquestionably clear that the 18 officers of APC that was “Elected” through this process could not have been duly elected. This constitutional vice infected the offices of:
1. Comrade Adams Oshiomhole – National Chairman
6. Bankole Oluwajana – National Vice Chairman (South West)
4. Ondo State – Hon. Eko Olakunle (National Vice Chairman South West)
5. Kaduna State – Hon. Hussaini Dambo (National Vice Chairman North West)

Not to mention that the coming 2018-19 free agency market has a far more attractive third baseman awaiting it, Manny Machado. And, with Machado likely to be on that market, in hand with Bryce Harper, Clayton Kershaw (assuming the Dodgers don't get to work on extending their franchise bellwether), and Madison Bumgarner (if the Giants don't work on extending him, letting him play the market rather than pick up his 2019 team option), it's not unrealistic to think of a large number of teams preparing for that market.
The good news: baseball has four more years to unravel the new thickets. The bad news: it won't be simple. Take it from Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman: "Because of analytics, the days when 30-year-olds get seven-year deals aren't going to happen very much anymore. I don't blame teams for that. It's smart." But then, as Zimmerman observes further, putting that much value into the first part of your career leaves open how players near the end still get a fair share of baseball's swelling revenues.

All-Star ballots The Rangers are highly unlikely to end up with a fan-selected All-Star this year, but those ballots were released Wednesday. They reflect the club's issues. While Adrian Beltre and Elvis Andrus, who have both been on the DL for most of the season, are on the ballot at third base and shortstop, respectively, neither Isiah Kiner-Falefa, the team's leader in WAR, nor regular first baseman Ronald Guzman are listed. The Rangers had to provide their ballot selections early in the season. It includes Joey Gallo at first base and, oddly, Jurickson Profar in the outfield. Profar has played regularly at shortstop in Andrus' absence, but has played just one inning in the outfield. Enter the phenom

Priyanka Chopra and her boyfriend Nick Jonas were in India last week and the duo ended up having one helluva time. First, they were at their housewarming ceremony in Mumbai and then flew to Goa for a holiday with Parineeti Chopra and then attended Akash Ambami and Shloka Mehta's mehendi and engagement ceremony in Mumbai as well. Now that the couple are in the US, they decided to step out for a night and were instead greeted by many fans on the streets. Priyanka and Nick, patiently stood for selfies and even hugged the fans in the end.
Mitchell: "Someone was smart enough to tell him, 'While you're in D.C. and you're attending different games, where a team from D.C.' When he goes back home he's going to resort back to what he's always been. He's a Cowboys fan, and I think Cowboys fans should be pissed off that he's wearing Redskins gear. That's the way I look at it."

With Bagley in the mix, Duke — who are, as of this posting, my pick to land the 6-foot-11 forward — would have a very strong case to be slotted as the preseason No. 1 team in the country. Given the way that last season went, that may not go over all that well, but there's a valid argument: The Blue Devils would start three freshmen — Bagley, Trevon Duval and Wendell Carter — that are top seven prospects in the class, according to 247 Sports composite rankings, and another who would be the No. 17 player in the class in Gary Trent Jr. They finally have a point guard to replace Tyus Jones in the for of Duval. Grayson Allen, the lone returnee from last year's team, is finally healthy, according to Mike Krzyzewski, and on paper is a veteran leader and an all-american caliber player.
Youth would be a major issue, as Allen would likely be the only rotation player that is an upperclassman. Depth is going to be another problem as well, as Duke's reserves will likely be made up of some combination of freshmen Alex O'Connell and Jordan Tucker and sophomore Marques Bolden and Javin DeLaurier.
Shiite militiamen loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr, the firebrand cleric for whose family the neighborhood is named, were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived.

Twenty-five years later, Super Bowl XXVII still has an indelible place in the hearts of Cowboys fans. It marked the end of 14 years in the NFL Championship Game wilderness, which seemed an eternity at the time. It helped erase the bad taste of Pittsburgh 35, Cowboys 31 in Super Bowl XIII while inaugurating the greatest Super Bowl run in franchise history. Cowboys 52, Buffalo Bills 17. Then what happened?

Neither of Barcelona's goalkeepers — Dutchman Jasper Cillessen and German Marc-Andre ter Stegen — is commanding in the air. Some defenders are vulnerable, which puts too much pressure on reliable stalwarts Gerard Pique and Javier Mascherano.
"We're a very vanilla-based defense," Church said. "He basically calls it bone on bone, man on man and the No. 1 rule we have in the rush room (the defensive lineman room) is won your one-on-ones. That's the way he's going to get pass rush."
Among the Cowboys who can step up is 6-7 defensive lineman David Irving. Irving started the season slow but tallied some dominant games including his 19-snap performance at Green Bay in October (four tackles, a sack, a stuff, three forced fumbles and a pass deflection) and his dismantling of Detroit quarterback Matt Stafford (three tackles, 1.5 sacks, a forced fumble and a pass deflection).

LOBOC AND BILAR MAN-MADE FOREST
The Loboc and Bilar Man-made forest is a 2-kilometer stretch of hardwood trees planted on the border of Loboc and Bilar Towns. Because of the uniformity of trees growing in the area, tourists can't help but notice such an amazing kaleidoscope of foliage lining the route.
So why do we need thousands of additional agents at the border? Evidently the manpower increase — along with the fencing and the high-tech surveillance gadgets that have never worked — is necessary so that legislators can proclaim their own toughness. But the consequences of swiftly bringing on such a huge influx of inexperienced personnel could prove deadly.

Musgrove (2-0) helped stop the Pirates' four-game losing streak, permitting one run and seven hits. He also slid hard into second baseman Javier Baez to break up a potential double play in the third inning.
The opening 10 minutes saw two fights, one of which had Ekblad sparring with Nicolas Deslauriers. It may have fired up the big defenseman because he stole a puck from Michael McCarron, deked past defenseman Jeff Petry and beat Niemi with a move to the backhand for an unassisted goal with 1:29 left in the opening period.

2006: Cowboys Traded #49-Kellen Clemons to Jets for #53-Anthony Fasano, #189-Drew Coleman, #211-Pat McQuistan. TRADE DOWN Cowboys Traded #80-Clint Ingram to Jaguars for #92-Jason Hatcher and #125-Skyler Green. TRADE DOWN 2005: No Trades (but the extra pick from 2004 accounted below). 2004: Cowboys traded away #22-J.P. Losman to Buffalo for #43-Julius Jones, #144-Sean Ryan, 2005 first round pick #20-Marcus Spears TRADE DOWN 2003: No Trades Summary of Parcells/Jones: As you can see, this is a unique period in which draft picks were used poorly, but they were always valued. The Cowboys only participated in 3 trades in 4 drafts of top 100 picks, but each time they were accumulating bodies and stepping back. They sent away 3 picks and brought back 8. This is how a roster is built quickly, if it can be done properly. Mistakes were made when Parcells ran the war-room, with the Steven Jackson/Julius Jones decision chief among them, Bobby Carpenter, and many offensive linemen too (Jacob Rogers, Stephen Peterman), and of course the legendary battle where Parcells wanted Marcus Spears or Shawne Merriman over DeMarcus Ware. But, overall, the efficiency and conservative nature of his draft day philosophy is in sharp contrast to say, Phillips/Jones. ===
Barry Switzer/Jerry Jones Era: 1997: Cowboys trade with the Eagles to get #22-David LaFleur and send away #25-Jon Harris, #155-Luther Broughton, 1998 third round pick #70-Brian Alford. TRADE UP They then trade #54-Kevin Abrams to Lions for #65-Dexter Coakley and #101-Antonio Anderson. TRADE DOWN 1996: Cowboys trade Washington Pick #30 - Andre Johnson for #37-Kavika Pittman and #67-Clay Shiver. TRADE DOWN Cowboys get pick #49-Randall Godfrey from Miami in exchange for #60-Michael Cheever and #99-Phillip Daniels. TRADE UP 1995: Cowboys trade Tampa Bay pick #28 - Derrick Brooks for #41-Ronald Davis and #63-Shane Hannah. TRADE DOWN Cowboys trade Atlanta pick #41 - Ronald Davis for #46-Sherman Williams and #110-Eric Bjornson. TRADE DOWN 1994: Cowboys trade for pick #23 - Shante Carver from San Francisco (also receive pick #217) for #28-William Floyd and #62-Tyrone Drakeford. TRADE UP Summary of Switzer/Jones Era: This was certainly a very active era where the Cowboys were constantly doing something in these 4 drafts. In the end, the trades up and trades back seem to cancel each-other out in number - but don't be fooled. The quantity is out-weighed by the details. The 1995 passing on Derrick Brooks for what amounts to Sherman Williams, Shane Hannah, and Eric Bjornson seems crazy. Also, the amount of heaven and earth that was moved to get Troy Aikman his new tight end in David LaFleur should not be under-rated, either. And in 1994, sending a 1st and 2nd to get Shante Carver is a bit cringe worthy, too. =====

Its 7:05 in the morning, and I step up to Navy Pier in Santa Barbara with a coffee in one hand and a notebook in the other. I'm here to check out the Saturday Fishermen's Market that a select group of Santa Barbara fishermen established to sell directly to their customers. What I found was not only a lesson in sustainability (which I will write about in an upcoming column), but dockside entertainment as well.
Being from the Northeast, I'm expecting a surly group, but instead am greeted by the assembled fishermen enthusiastically. The market is open from 7 to 11 a.m., but they have been preparing for hours.
The Fishermen's Market works side by side with the Santa Barbara Fish Market to bring the best fresh seafood to our pier. The fishermen themselves cannot fillet the whole fish for you, but they kindly direct customers to the Santa Barbara Fish Market, where it can be processed free of charge.
Just a stall over was fisherman Paul Teall, selling rock crab and, interestingly, kelp. Teall isn't shy and loudly touts kelp as “the new kale!” to anyone passing by. He has printed up a fact sheet for customers and has plenty of recipes for those new to kelp.
On the other side of Mutz is fisherman Sam Shrout, who had live rock crab every time I was there. He had copper rockfish in all sizes, but what really impressed me was the selection of live lingcod.
I should note that in addition to rockfish, crab and the other species listed here, the fishermen also sell halibut, local salmon, spot prawns, white seabass and spiny lobster among other things when available. If you follow Mutz on Twitter @seastephfish, she posts updates before the market for the whole group and will even help you reserve a fish to pick up!
“He had a gun in his hand, and he held his girlfriend as a shield, standing there like that, and they had a 10-year-old boy with them," Donahue said of the bizarre scene.
LINE ITEMS: LSU's offensive line has been a glaring weak spot the past three games and faces a tough test at Florida. Against Troy, the Tigers started two freshmen — right guard Ed Ingram and right tackle Saahdiq Charles — on the offensive line for the first time since 1986.

Is this the biggest snowman built in Brum?
As the region remains in the grip of an arctic freeze and snow continues to batter the area, many children - and adults - have been making the most of it - showing off their snowman making skills.
Social media has been all a flurry with posts of snowmen across the Midlands of various shapes and sizes but Northfields may be home to the biggest snowman in the whole city.
Lithuanian born Audrius Grubliauskas, 23, sent us this picture of the gigantic snowman he made near his brother's Northfield home on Ley Hill Road.
The snowman has a height of almost three metres and was built with the help of Audrius' girlfriend Patricija,20, his brother Aidas, 24 and his fiancee Milda, 26.
The Northfields snowman definitely wins on the size of his girth. Audrius, who lives in Erdington added :"The snowman's width at the bottom level (diameter) was almost 2 meters and the circumference around 6 meters.”
Meanwhile Great Barr, Graeme Kimberley's snowman measured almost 9ft!
Is your snowman bigger? Email newsdesk@birminghammail.co.uk with the evidence!
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Denver M. Lough, MD, PhD stated, "With such recent and significant growth, Polarity is proud to announce that we have recruited another tremendous block of talent, including Michael V. Callahan MD, DTM&H, MSPH as Director of Military and Mass Casualty Regenerative Medicine Programs. Dr. Callahan is President of United Therapeutics Corporation ( NASDAQ : UTHR) Division of Cellular Therapies and faculty member of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Director of Translational Medicine for the Vaccine and Immunotherapeutics Center (VIC) at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School.

Well, this wasn't in anyone's plans. Not in owner Tom Gaglardi's when he paid for the offseason acquisitions of Hitchcock, Bishop, forward Alexander Radulov, defenseman Marc Methot and others. Not in the plans of fans who wore Bishop jerseys to AAC for his first regular-season start in a home uniform.
5. Is it time to start calling Villanova the favorite to win it all?: Our Travis Hines was in Omaha for that game and penned an excellent column on this very subject. I won't totally repeat it here, but I will say this: The freshmen at Duke, Kentucky and UCLA have been as hyped as any freshmen class in recent memory; rightfully so, those dudes are awesome. Baylor has been celebrated because of the fact that no one saw this coming. North Carolina is North Carolina and played the most entertaining game of the year in the most watched game of the year against Kentucky.
The monarch said:“We cannot continue to allow them to operate the OML again because it is about 37 years since they started exploration activities in that community and when you go there, there is nothing to show that there is the presence of a multinational oil company like Shell there.

She basically tells her boyfriend that women in Manhattan don't wear scrunchies because they're too sophisticated. They get in a fight over it — even break up.
Her boyfriend thinks it's nonsense, mainly because he's just written a book featuring a female protagonist who, yes, wears a scrunchy. Carrie ribs him for it. He obviously can't take the criticism.
Mandy Pifer, whose boyfriend Shannon Johnson was killed in the terror attack, said the plea agreement brought mixed emotions.
Orr said he's not sure when, but he expects Huntsville-Lee defensive lineman Malik Langham to pick Alabama. Orr really likes Langham. Long and very athletic. 6-5, 270. Great frame. Good basketball player. Orr feels he is just developing as a football player and his potential is limitless.
Tider Insider feels Alabama is in great position to land offensive lineman Nicholas Petit-Frere of Tampa-Berekeley. Ohio State and possibly Florida is in the mix. Again, as noted previously, spots in this class are filling up so it will be interesting to see what happens with Petit-Frere.

My husband, Don, was diagnosed with lymphoma in mid-2015. His initial treatment was done in Rock Springs at the Sweetwater County Memorial Hospital. After 8 rounds of chemotherapy we found out his cancer was not responding. We then went to The Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City. Once again, the cancer did not respond to treatment and we were forced to look for other options. Don was very fortunate to be accepted into a clinical trial in California. Before we left Wyoming, I spoke with former Chairman Wally Johnson to apprise him of the situation. He told me that I needed to do what was necessary for my husband. I assured Chairman Johnson that the office would be in good hands and that I would stay in contact. I had access to my work computer with our office laptop and a remote desktop link. During my time away, none of my employees lied about where I was or tried to hide anything about my absence. In fact, I was told afterward that the people who did ask where I was and heard the story, were very supportive and hoped Don made a full recovery.

The former Odd Future frontman was very vocal about his usual hatred for hip hop music being played with a live band following this one-of-a-kind display. He said, “That was cool. I've only worked with like one band and I f***in' hated it. And I've always hated rap music with bands, because I want to hear 808s and s**t and not an Incubis f***in' kick drum. So I was always skeptical—especially with some of the drum sounds I use—how to use a band to my full potential. With the chords and the musical aspects of my music, you may think it would work, but sometimes it doesn't get the whole thought across. So I've always been hesitant to even approach it.”

Last Monday in this space, we recommended fantasy baseball team owners drop catcher/first baseman Alex Avila after his trade from the Detroit Tigers to the Chicago Cubs. Then, the defending World Series champions suddenly lose their top catcher to an injury a few days later, and Avila suddenly has fantasy relevancy once again. It's a tough world to stay on top of for six months straight, isn't it?

Dark horse for Dark knight? The Mets, who could use both a second baseman and relief help, are reportedly making RHP Matt Harvey available, and that would be a very intriguing arm for the Rangers rotation. The Rangers have a second baseman to trade in Jurickson Profar. To boot, Harvey has struggled to recover from Thoracic Outlet Syndrome surgery, and that's a rehab the Rangers seem to specialize in. All makes sense so far.

During a one-on-one meeting with UML Chairman K P Sharma Oli and a group meeting held with senior UML leaders on Thursday evening, Minister Swaraj said that Prime Minister Modi was happy over the clear mandate received by the UML-led leftist alliance.
Minister Swaraj went directly to Hotel Soaltee Crown Plaza, where she had a one-on-one meeting with CPN-UML Chairman K P Sharma Oli for over 45 minutes and a 45-minute group meeting with senior UML leaders.

The visit of Minister Swaraj without any specific agenda this time is widely seen as New Delhi's overtures to improve its difficult relations with the CPN-UML, which is set to form the new government, and to reset ties between the two countries. Relations between Nepal and India reached a new low during the premiership of UML Chairman Oli following the promulgation of the new constitution.

The Panthers tied the score during a third-period power play at the 10:11 mark. Florida center Jonathan Huberdeau went down after being cross-checked by Red Wings defenseman Niklas Kronwall, but as he lay on the ice, Huberdeau slipped a pass back across the front of the net to Trocheck, whose quick shot banked into the Detroit net off the outstretched glove of Wings goalie Jimmy Howard.

His rowing career came to an abrupt end when he suffered a back injury during a race aged 24. But McGrath had no intention on giving up on sport. He took up martial arts and earned five black belts. He was trained in Hapkido by Bruce Lee's coach DoJuNim in New York, and learned the art of Kombatan in the Philippines before his fascination with old-time strongmen took his career on yet another path.
Now he uses these strongman skills to inspire young people in the townships around Cape Town. “I give motivational speeches to kids and gang members and show them how I bend nails and break out of handcuffs. I grew up with no running water or electricity, so it's important for them to know that you can rise above any difficult situation and become something if you apply mental strength.”
McGrath says the concept of maintaining peak physical performance is the ultimate metaphor for changing your life. “Forging martial arts with strongmen principles is a unique but effective way to live and I use it to train local athletes to achieve peak performance,” he says.

Great idea, right?

Going bigger: The Mavericks played a bigger lineup at times when they had Maxi Kleber on the floor with Nowitzki and Harrison Barnes or Dwight Powell. Like most teams, they still went small at critical times with three guards on the floor. But they did a good job of mixing up the lineups. Kleber continues to impress. He played a season-high 34 minutes and tied his season best with 16 points. Another rookie who has been seeing more action lately is Antonius Cleveland, who is with the team on a two-way contract. He played 18 minutes and had two blocks and three steals. But as coach Rick Carlisle said, he tempered his enthusiasm because the Mavericks were outscored by 11 points in the 18 minutes the swingman played.

Congresswoman Wilson Takes Leadership Role in Working with Key Stakeholders to Address Gun Violence
MIAMI – On Monday, July 2, Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson met with U.S. Attorney Benjamin Greenberg, local law enforcement officials and other stakeholders to discuss gun violence and keeping children safe in District 24 and throughout Miami-Dade County.
“It is vitally important that key leaders and stakeholders join forces to curb and ultimately end the gun violence that is plaguing our communities. Our goal was to brainstorm ideas to achieve these goals and then work collaboratively whenever possible to turn those ideas into action,” said Congresswoman Wilson. “This is a team effort and we are all deeply committed to using every resource at our disposal to keep our communities and our children safe.”
During the meeting, Congresswoman Wilson discussed her efforts in Washington and locally to curb gun violence, and outlined opportunities for local, state, and federal officials to work jointly to reduce gun violence in Miami-Dade.
Earlier this year, Congresswoman Wilson held a gun violence town hall in her district to get input from the community and other stakeholders.
Last month, Congresswoman Wilson introduced several gun violence prevention measures, including H.R. 6297 – The Assault Weapon Ban and Regulatory Reform Act of 2018: This bill will put the nation on a path to banning all assault weapons. It builds on the Assault Weapons Ban Act of 2018 by requiring the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to establish a new regulatory framework to evaluate guns on the market and determine whether they are assault weapons on their capacity to injure and kill rather than just their features and names.
Congresswoman Wilson suggested that boxes be placed in every school so that children can share problems, tips and perceived threats that will be retrieved by school resource officers. She also stressed the need for early intervention to prevent boys and young men from joining gangs and engaging in other activities that lead to gun violence.
“Gang violence is a generational curse too often passed down from fathers and uncles. It is imperative that we do everything that we can to break it as swiftly as possible,” Congresswoman Wilson said.
Congresswoman Wilson pledged to strongly support applications for grants to carry out these efforts and identified several sources of funding, including:

The Wild (37-13-6) had won their previous two meetings of the season vs. Anaheim, but fell behind early and were frustrated by Gibson throughout. Minnesota failed to score on five power plays in the game, coming within an inch of scoring when a long-range slap shot by defenseman Christian Folin hit the inside of the right post, sailed through the crease and to the side boards.
Anaheim lost top-line left winger Antoine Vermette with 12:27 to play in the third period after he was ejected for slashing linesman Shandor Alphonso.
The University of Maryland wants to get more undergraduate students involved in complex research projects — and much earlier in their collegiate careers. The main campus admits roughly 600 freshmen each year into its First-Year Innovation and Research Experience (FIRE)
With Bagley now in the fold, Duke has four five-star prospects enrolling in this class, including the potential No. 1 pick and two more borderline top five recruits in point guard Trevon Duval and big man Wendell Carter. Throw in scoring machine Gary Trent Jr., and that's a well-rounded, talented recruiting class. All four of those freshmen should be expected to start alongside Grayson Allen, the most well-known and disliked college basketball player in the country who, according to Mike Krzyzewski, is finally healthy and back to playing like the guy that was an All-American as a sophomore and the Preseason National Player of the Year as a junior.
Youth is going to be a major issue. Allen is the only rotation player that is an upperclassman, and the other two returnees are Marques Bolden and Javin DeLaurier, neither of whom got much experience playing last season. Depth is going to be another problem as well, as Duke's reserves will likely be made up of some combination of Bolden, DeLaurier and freshmen Alex O'Connell and Jordan Tucker.

DUP Newry & Armagh Assemblyman William Irwin MLA has met with Department officials in Dundonald House this week to raise a number of issues affecting farmers across the province.
“I saw that their third baseman was playing back on the grass with two strikes on Antonio,'' Canzler said. “I thought here's the time to take advantage of it and it kind of worked out how I saw it in my head. They didn't get back to the bag in time. (Once the ball got past the bag), with Richie (Rossi) probably being the fastest player in the district, that's a no-brainer to send him home.''
The SMH claimed: "What triggered his lunge at Root was the young Yorkshireman's positioning of a green-and-gold wig on his chin, which Warner interpreted as mocking the South African batsman Hashim Amla." Sure. Obviously he did.
Not the first sportsman to confuse hitting a ball around with actually killing people in combat, and sadly, he probably won't be the last. No wigs involved this time, as far as we can tell, though.

This shooting is an attack on all who serve and on all who participate in our democracy,” she wrote. “I am heartbroken for the pain of Congressman Scalise, the other victims, and their family, friends, and colleagues who survived. I am thankful for the great courage of the Capitol Police, who were my protectors after I was shot and became my friends. I also know the courage it takes to recover from a shooting like this, and I know Steve and everyone there this morning has such courage in great supply.”

“We are very, very enthusiastic about Tracy's job and this staff's job in recruiting,” he said. “It's not coincidental that five or six or seven freshmen started in our lineup. Last year our recruiting class at ASU baseball was one of the best in the country.”
“Those freshmen and sophomores and those pitchers need to have upgraded performance next year because now you have one, two and three very solid recruiting classes that should be able to put it together and play competitive baseball at a level we anticipate,” Anderson said.
“It's not good enough. He's a linesman beside him, he can air his grievances to the linesman, there's a fourth official behind him, but all he wanted to do was go in to Diarmuid Kirwan and it could have turned out to be pretty nasty. When he sees it again he'll agree he was out of order.”

Cobra transmission director Alan Edwards had more than 50 linemen working on the repair, at nearly $4,000 per worker per day in federal funds from the Puerto Rico power authority, when he got the call to stop. A flaw was causing a transmission line to overheat dangerously elsewhere in the system, so the line alongside where Edwards' men were working would have to be returned to service, forcing the crews to stop for at least the rest of the day.

Despite the losses, shareholders' equity slightly increased at year end.Mr. Wasef Jabsheh, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IGI, said: "IGI's full year results were announced against the backdrop of a very difficult year, which saw a competitive trading environment continue to keep pressure on rates, followed by catastrophe losses in the third quarter. Despite this, we stuck to our strategy of strict underwriting discipline and focused on maintaining a healthy and diversified portfolio.""Meanwhile, our growth in GWP in all of IGI's major lines of business proves the strength of fsbdt the Group's market expertise, and demonstrates our commitment to a strategy of disciplined profitable growth.""Last year's historical catastrophes have undoubtedly had their impact on the market.

This is of utmost importance to IGI and we take pride in our strong track record reflecting a prompt and efficient claims service.""We view the coming year with optimism.

Throughout the campaign, religious and ideological sentiments were used against him by supporters of his opponent, millionaire businessman Prabowo Subianto, a former Special Forces general and onetime son-in-law of the late strongman Suharto.

On the ground, we meet our main players — Y'lan Noel, who makes a hunky and very charismatic drug kingpin; Lex Scott Davis, as his old girlfriend who has become a community activist; and Joivan Wade as her younger brother, torn between the lure of quick drug money and his sister's unwavering morality. Rotimi Paul makes an absolutely frightening psycho and Steve Harris is an always welcome addition. (There's also a cameo by Van Jones as a TV reporter skeptical of the purges.)
The 38-year-old reality TV star is fed up with seeing her former boyfriend - who is the father of her three children - photographed with a bevy of beauties and in a scathing attack, she called his women "hookers".

Rounding out this release of four acts for Roots & Blues 2018 is David Thiaw – educator, master drummer, artist, composer, craftsman and storyteller. Thiaw's first home was in Senegal. He has memories of growing up in Dakar, with the scent of the Atlantic, the sand of the beaches and the music of the people inspiring him. African and World music have been David's lifelong passion. He formed his first band when he was 14 years old, and began a lifetime of world travel, learning about musical genres and their relation to – if not their debt to – West African rhythms. For a number of years, Thiaw has called the Interior of B.C. home. Growing up in a culture where music was part of the every-day not only started Thiaw on the path he walks today, but also nurtured his strong belief that the ability to play and sing is a human right shared by all. That will be one of his missions at the Roots & Blues festival where a couple of his performances will be of the interactive variety.
SAN DIEGO — Pinch-hitter Hunter Renfroe's infield single in the ninth inning led to two runs when third baseman Miguel Rojas followed with a throwing error, lifting the San Diego Padres to a 3-2 victory over the Miami Marlins on Wednesday night.
Closer Brad Ziegler (0-5) coughed up a one-run lead when he loaded the bases with one out. Renfroe hit a chopper to Rojas, who was charging. He double-clutched his throw, which was low to first baseman Justin Bour. When the ball skipped away from Bour, Freddy Galvis came home with the winning run.

The usual pre-game pomp at T-Mobile Arena, which includes showgirls lining the glass in the Washington end during warmups and a knight defeating an opponent in a sword battle on the ice, also featured a performance by Las Vegas band Imagine Dragons and an appearance by UFC legend Randy Couture.
The winger knocked teammate Luca Sbisa's flipped clearing attempt out of midair at the offensive blue line in front of Dmitry Orlov, who tried to knock the puck down with his glove, before stepping past the Capitals defenceman and beating Holtby for his fifth.
The Iron Duke was a keen country sportsman in the years after the Napoleonic Wars, an while he was a sought-after guest, not all his visits were without blemish. In 1823, he managed to hit his host Lord Glanville in the face and, at Lady Shelley's, his shot reached a tenant who was hanging out her washing. His hostess declared: ‘You have endured a great honour today, Mary – you have the distinction of being shot by the Duke of Wellington.' Mary's grateful response is not recorded.
Even great statesmen became duellists
Future US President Andrew Jackson fought several duels and killed a famous marksman, Charles Dickinson, in 1806. Abraham Lincoln and an adversary were dissuaded by their seconds in 1842, while Irish statesman Daniel O'Connell killed a duel opponent in 1815.
The modern Olympic Games once featured ‘duelling pistol' events with military revolvers and, in 1906, a quasi-Olympics called the Intercalated Games included marksmanship with real duelling pistols at 20m and 30m. The targets were dummies dressed in frock coats with bullseyes pinned at chest level.
The 7th Earl of Cardigan, soldier, fine horseman and shot, called out Capt Harvey Tuckett, in 1841, for publishing an account of a mess incident involving a black bottle of porter and shot him with a duelling pistol with a rifled barrel and hair trigger; both features considered unsporting.
Two Frenchmen agreed to duel from balloons over Paris in 1808, one plummeting to his death after his envelope was punctured. Other recorded duels included a pair of duellists in 1842 – again, Frenchmen – by throwing billiard balls.
Probably the most flamboyant sportsman of the era was ‘Squire' George Osbaldeston, a Yorkshire landowner, hard cross-country and race rider, pugilist, inveterate gambler and remarkable shot whose recorded flintlock achievements included 100 pheasants with 100 shots, 97 grouse with 97 shots and 20 brace of partridge with 40 shots. ‘And he was a dead shot with a duelling pistol, for he put 10 shots on the ace of diamonds at 30ft,' wrote the editor of The Field in an introduction to Osbaldeston's autobiography, discovered in his papers and published in 1926.

U.S. Congressman Stephen Scalise was shot Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, just south of Washington, while he and other Republican congressional lawmakers were practicing for an annual baseball game.

After performing with Marc Anthony at a sold-out show at the Los Altos de Chavón theater in the Dominican Republic on Saturday, Jennifer Lopez, 47, showed off her dance moves with her new boyfriend Alex Rodriguez, 41 — alongside her ex-husband — at a private afterparty.
Last month, Rodriguez gushed about his girlfriend — who arrived in the Dominican Republic last Thursday with her 9-year-old twins Max and Emme — during an appearance on The View. “It's obvious. We've been having a great time. She's an amazing, amazing girl,” he said. “One of the smartest human beings I've ever met and also an incredible mother.”
The track is the first new music from the band since their 2012 album Battle Born (assuming you don't count their 2016 Christmas album Don't Waste Your Wishes). Hopefully, this signals a fifth studio effort is imminent. “The Man” was recorded with the producer Jacknife Lee during album sessions in Las Vegas and Los Angeles. The song finds frontman Brandon Flowers looking back on his younger self, the persona from their Grammy-nominated debut Hot Fuss, and reconciling that wide-eyed character with the man he is now.

Since the first Hell in a Cell PPV in 2009, the concept of having an entire PPV annually branded under WWE's most famous singles match has been debated.

For the record, that wasn't always the case as there have been several Hells in a Cell matches from the 90s that were extremely forgettable (does anyone really remember Mankind vs Kane?), but the general principle was that the match was only brought out under extreme circumstances.

At first, it seemed like a classic first day in Paradise: One by one, the cast of men and women trickled in and began getting to know each other. Jackson, who had gotten himself into hot water after it was revealed he had a girlfriend during Rachel Lindsay‘s season of The Bachelorette, knew a “hostile” reception might be awaiting him, and he wasn't wrong — but he insisted he had every intention of showing a “different side” of himself.
But before that could happen, without any warning, things came to an abrupt and screeching halt during the cocktail party before the ceremony. First, a producer came to pull Olympios aside, while another asked to speak to Jackson in private as the cameramen began to set their equipment down. Confusion and chaos descended on the cast, with no one seeming to have any idea what could have caused them to suddenly suspend production — though Taylor Nolan speculated it might have something to do with “Corinne and DeMario from the first night.”

Set in Northern Italy during the early 1980s, this coming-of-age drama chronicles the romantic relationship between the precocious 17-year-old son (Timothee Chalamet) of an archaeology professor (Michael Stuhlbarg) and the graduate student (Armie Hammer) who lodges with the lad's family while serving as his father's temporary assistant. Amid a hothouse atmosphere, beautiful scenery and dialogue designed to show how highly cultured all the characters are, director Luca Guadagnino's adaptation of Andre Aciman's novel, written for the screen by James Ivory, veers between discreet sensuality and outright vulgarity. All the while, the film invites viewers to accept with perfect equanimity its young hero's sexual experimentations, carried out, nearly simultaneously, not only with the hunky houseguest but with the youth's local-bred girlfriend (Esther Garrel) as well. A misguided outlook on human sexuality, strong sexual content, including brief graphic underage activity, aberrant acts, as well as upper female and rear nudity, a mild oath, several rough and at least one crude term.

Let's look at the construction and workmanship of the Gucci horse bit loafer. First, when I looked at it on the website, I was quite disappointed because there wasn't much detail. They just said black leather and horsebit, but they didn't talk about what kind of leather, how it was tanned, how it was constructed if it was sewn, glued, what kind of construction it was. I was weary because I expected that it wasn't a good shoe after all. Now, when I got the shoe, the actual first impression was much better. You could see the moccasin top was sewn by hand, that was quite obvious because of the different stitch density on the side and in the front which is a hallmark of handwork. You could also see little puckering along the edges which is typical for hand-sewn moccasins. The leather is very nice and has good quality. It is hand stained, but that makes more of a difference with brown shoes, not really with black. However, Italians are very good with leather especially around Florence so you can be rest assured that you get a quality hide on Gucci loafers.

MANILA, Philippines – Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman Andres Bautista on Monday, August 14, skipped a House committee on suffrage and electoral reforms hearing on the possible postponement of the scheduled 2017 elections.
"I actually am a bit confused as to the reason given by Chairman Bautista for his non-appearance today. He opted to go for a public hearing on the same elections... I wonder why the Chairman gave priority to a public hearing compared to a session of Congress that's considering to pass a law on the postponement of the elections," he said, asking commissioners if Bautista's personal issues was already affecting preparations.
"Firstly, to say that the present controversy is not affecting at all the honorable chairman of the Comelec or even the institution is perhaps to make an understatement. That said, in my humble view, whether or not Chairman Bautista continues as chairman or takes a leave of absence or resigns as chairman of the Commission is a judgment call which he alone can and should make," he said during the hearing.

“This is the song that started us down the rabbit hole with our recent cover recordings,” said frontman M. Shadows in a press release. “I've always loved this song and though I felt it would be impossible to capture the somberness of the original, we approached it with another purpose. There's a poignancy to the song that seems appropriate with everything going on in the world today. We put a bit of a modern twist on it to reintroduce it at a time when it might help capture what some of us are feeling.”

Empowering the modern artisan is a continual challenge of Vora's eponymous design label. Having been raised in a family of textile merchants, the appreciation of the craftsmanship is integral to her body of work. Providing consumers the transparency of the production cycle is a key component of the design practice. Making consumers aware of the instability, insecurity and frameless economic nature of this underbelly of the design sector is critical towards understanding why certain techniques are used over others in the collection. The lack of social welfare, irregular wages and a subsequent decline in pursuing these crafts has contributed to the dwindling cycle of refined handwork. The comprehension of this vicious cycle of consumer ignorance and artisan helplessness is thus key to understanding the necessity to preserve age-old artisan techniques. These techniques are not just of heritage value, but of socio-economic value too. They empower people with skills, consumers with choice, and the global fashion industry with alternatives. Yet, their worth is undermined, and their production exploited. Vora tries to embody just the opposite.

The anomaly is Oxford's visit in 2013, when the dark Blues triumphed against type. Typically, it has taken an astounding piece of individualism to leave Fenners with something. This time, Sam Agarwal hit the first ever triple century in the University Match – a staggering 313*(312). It was Oxford's first away success since 2005, when, that time, Salil Oberoi had plundered the previous high score, a masterful 247. In fact, in Varsity history, three of the highest four individual scores have been hit by Oxford batsmen playing in away fixtures at Fenners. All three have been in the first innings; all three have set up innings defeats; and all three have been since the turn of the millennium. The third? A 236* hit by future England international Jamie Dalrymple in 2003. Fenners is a venue entrenched in rich history.

I can't begin to tell you how often friends (teachers included) say they live vicariously through my exploits on Facebook. As a journalist I get to go places, do things, and meet people that many of my friends will never get to experience. That's been the best part of being a newspaperman all these years. I live a very surreal life. It's all those life experiences that keep me going, not the money. Despite what is happening to the print industry, this is a very exciting time to be in journalism. Communication has never been more instant and competition tougher.

IN TWIN PEAKS | Chad is arrested and thrown in the slammer. They all know he's a crooked cop. And then Truman, Hawk, Andy and Bobby set off into the woods towards Jack Rabbit's Palace (as instructed by the other message in Major Briggs' secret tube). At the end of their journey, the four cops find a woman sleeping naked in the forest. Why, it's Naido, the eyeless woman from the purple room who fell away into space back in Part 3. She must have fallen out of the vortex that just then re-opens to take Andy away. (One of the things I am enjoying most about this season of Twin Peaks is that every original character is getting a great moment, or being made important in some unexpected way. Andy has always been a clown, and I never suspected, but seriously loved, that he would be chosen for such an incredible event). Andy meets the Giant, whom we now know by his real name, The Fireman. The Fireman shows Andy a supercut of Twin Peaks, then sends him back to earth to protect Naido. She is placed into a jail cell near Chad, and an unknown bleeding drunk. The nonsense that follows is both creepy and wonderful (not to mention a brilliant callback to Bobby and Mike barking at James from their jail cell in the original pilot).
Speaking of James Hurley, turns out he is now a security guard at the Great Northern Hotel. He has to do things like check the furnace in the scary basement. There's a metal door down there that looks suspiciously like it could be the other side of the door from Part 3, the door that “mother” was banging on in the purple room (where Naido lived). James' co-worker with the mysterious green glove on one hand is Freddie (Jake Wardle). It turns out that Freddie also met The Fireman (that vortex has openings all over the world). The Fireman gave Freddie one super strong hand and sent him off to Twin Peaks. It seems that the Fireman is orchestrating everything, and I am guessing that Freddie and his hand will play an important part in the great reckoning that takes place once every single character arrives in town.
“I'd like to kill 'em,” groused Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a close Trump ally, referring to the administration's expanding list of tariffs. … “Individual senators have met with the president, including me.

While most people under 30 were probably extremely confused who The Time were, Prince's Purple Rain foes (but real-life friends and collaborators) nevertheless won over the crowd through the infectious energy of their endearingly absurd dance moves during “Jungle Love.” But after that, holy hell, Bruno Mars — wearing Prince's Purple Rain poofy shirt and suit — absolutely destroyed the stage with “Let's Go Crazy.” While it's nearly impossible to cover Prince and one-up him (Sinead is the only one to do so thus far in human history), Bruno's showmanship and versatile vocals delivered what has been the finest awards-show tribute to Prince so far. And when he capped it off with some unhinged shredding at the song's close, any jaws that hadn't dropped already undoubtedly hit the floor.

We knew when the Phillies decided to sign Scott Kingery to a six-year deal and keep him on the opening-day roster that the rookie was going to cut into the playing time of some of the regulars. We now also know that the greatest impact has been on third baseman Maikel Franco. Kingery has made six starts at third base this season, and five of them have come when the Phillies were facing righthanded pitchers.
The Diamondbacks were hopeful that third baseman Jake Lamb would be back for the start of the series against the Phillies, but elbow inflammation will extend his time on the disabled list. Lamb has not played since April 2 because of a shoulder injury. He has been a Phillies killer over the years. In 17 career games against the Phillies, he has a .344 average with five home runs, 14 RBIs and a 1.114 OPS. The lefthanded-hitting third baseman is also batting .400 (10 for 25) against the Phillies' three schedule starters in this series. Devin Marrero, Lamb's primary replacement at third base, is hitting .219 with one extra-base hit.
The craftsmanship — from the dramatic sprays of cock feathers used as shoulder accents or covering a dress, to the gowns in glittering embroidered tiger-striped motifs — was impressive. It heightened the luxe factor in a collection strong on striking evening gowns, even if didn't break new ground.

Fishermen have expressed concerns over the financial impact of the closures, and Gosselin said observers on the planes know the impact of their reports and how important it is to be accurate.
6. Defensive line coach Chris Wilson might be the most vocal of the assistants. He was much quieter last year, but seems to have become more comfortable as evidenced by the expletive-filled rants he often directs at his players. When Wentz found a wide-open Smith underneath, Wilson dropped a litany of f-bombs at his first unit. When defensive end Alex McCalister was flagged for a neutral-zone violation, his coach vocally pulled him to the sidelines and gave him an earful. Wilson might have fired up end Steve Means, who locked horns with tight end Anthony Denham after one play. They tussled until offensive linemen Taylor Hart and Josh Andrews broke it up. Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox left practice with an apparent injury. Gabe Wright took a number of first-team snaps in his place.

Their relationship is amazing, because they are both committed to making it work. It's just a very normal and respectful relationship, built on give-and-take. Joe is a gentleman and just a great guy to date.”
SNOW DAY: Snowball fight! On a day like this, Bills linebacker Ryan Davis could hardly resist. Davis scooped up handfuls of the white stuff and started pelting teammates to celebrate a sack. It was one of dozens of must-see moments from Buffalo's 13-7 overtime win over Indianapolis that will be remembered for one thing: snow. Fans built snowmen in the stands, players did snow angels on the field and all 11 members of the Colts special teams — plus some sideline personnel who were later removed from the field by officials — had to kick away piles of ankle-high snow to clear a spot for Adam Vinatieri to try the game-tying extra point late in the fourth quarter.

Fifteen of the last 18 Heisman winners have been QBs, so there is good chance another will win it next season. Darnold is one of several underclassmen quarterbacks who might decide to enter the NFL draft. But if they do return to school, they would be a good bet to enter the Heisman race.

The next game is on Wednesday 25th April with GCM taking on Kirk Freeport.

It was nauseating to witness Donald Trump, surrounded by grinning handkerchief-head Black quislings, read a tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King. The bumbling fashion in which he read the text made it clear that he was not familiar with the facts, nor was it coming from the heart. Like so much about Trump, it came across as phony. That was certainly how it struck Congressman John Lewis, who walked with Dr. King in the heat of the Civil Rights battle and was brutally beaten by racist redneck cops on the Edmund Pettis bridge during the voter registration drive in Lowndes County, Alabama.
One way to prevent this dreaded intermixing with inferior racial stock was by controlling their presence in the American population through immigration policy.

Noel is a survivor herself; she was trafficked as a teenager by the boyfriend she trusted.
That no amount of knowledge or tenacity or craftsmanship can substitute for the alchemy of working on the right project at the right time. My first book was written in response to the loss of a loved one – a grandfather who had essentially raised me – and eulogized not only a relationship, but also a particular phase of life. It took me a long time, and many false starts, to find my way to a project where I felt that same synthesis of subject and psychological state again. And when they come together, the writing itself changes: It doesn't feel like work, it doesn't feel like sentences in a holding pattern. It's just necessity. (And then it's revision, of course.)

The first base position has traditionally been loaded with talent and a primary source of power for fantasy players. With overall HR totals increasing for four straight seasons, and perceived depth at the position, some fantasy managers may put off selecting a first baseman until the later rounds of their drafts. That used to be a good strategy but in 2018 it may expose you to risk.
There's quality talent at the position in the later rounds, but if you wait too long, you might end up with a first baseman better qualified to be your corner infielder.
If you want to roster one of the top bats at the position, grab your first baseman by the fifth round of a 12 team rotisserie league. Here's what you can expect with regards to the first base position in National Fantasy Baseball Championship (NFBC) drafts:
Paul Goldschmidt is a mid to late first round pick. No, the humidor will not be his kryptonite. He'll still hit approximately 30 HRs. He is one of the few first basemen who can steal 20 plus bases.

Veteran defenseman Nick Holden and rookie forward Pavel Buchnevich arrived on far different paths to this critical juncture in the Rangers' season.
Holden, acquired for a fourth-round draft pick last June, led all Rangers defensemen with 11 goals — three on the power play — and added 23 assists for 34 points in 80 games. All were career highs.
What defenseman Brady Skjei likes about Holden is his all-around game. “He's a steady player and has a good shot from the point, obviously,'' Skjei said. “He's got 11 goals this year, which is a lot for a defenseman. He makes the simple play, he's strong, big, skates well. You need all those aspects to be a good defenseman in this league. I think he had a really good season. He's a nice guy, not a rah-rah guy in the room, but everyone respects him; when he says something, you listen. He's been around a while and he's been good to all the young guys, me, Vesey, Buch.”
Vigneault declined to explain how he reached the decision to scratch Holden for Game 3, although the defenseman broke his stick and was out of position on Tomas Plekanec's goal that tied Game 2 with 17.3 seconds remaining.
“I still do like his game,” Vigneault said. “I think he's dependable, a good, steady defenseman who can move the puck when the pressure is on. Like any player in any year, he has good moments and some other moments might be a little more challenging. If he plays tomorrow, I'm going to expect him to be good.''

Sri Lankans could barely manage to put such performance in place. Even at times when they did, they couldn't keep it consistent unlike their Indian counterparts.
No, it's not ideal that veteran defenceman Dion Phaneuf wouldn't waive his ‘no move' clause to be exposed to the Vegas Golden Knights in next week's expansion draft so the club can protect Marc Methot, but there's absolutely no reason for the Senators to panic because they likely knew this scenario was coming.
Don't expect the Senators to shift gears with their approach to the expansion draft and decide to protect eight forwards along with a goalie just because Phaneuf hasn't agreed to the request to waive the clause, either. The seven forwards, three defencemen and one goalie approach is what works for Dorion and the Senators.
Defencemen Fredrik Claesson, who will also be exposed and is on the Knights' radar screen, had a strong performance when he got a chance in the playoffs and has looked good with Karlsson. Claesson is signed for next season at $650,000 and that's also why he may be an option for Vegas.
Defenceman Ben Harpur, who was pressed into duty during the club's series against the Boston Bruins after being called up from the club's AHL affiliate in Binghamton, will get the chance to push for more time in training camp and he's become a player that coach Guy Boucher can trust which is a major step.

Most sexual assault cases are never reported to police and of those that are, less than 20 percent are actually prosecuted according to law enforcement data.The relative few that make it to court, play out much like the case against alleged serial rapist Marc Winner, now underway in Cook County. Winner's legal team claims the alleged victim was a willing participant in a night of romance; and suggests her accusation of sexual assault was generated by cocaine and alcohol.Winner allegedly attacked a former employee of his West Loop tanning salon in July 2009. Prosecutors say the victim, named J.B. in court proceedings, had been out with girlfriends when she ran into her ex-boss.Tuesday on the witness stand was a Chicago police officer who first encountered J.B. on the night of the alleged sexual assault."J.B. was very distressed, ah, crying and very upset," said CPD patrolman William Colon."She said I was raped," by Winner, according to Colon.Prosecutors asked several witnesses on Tuesday whether J.B. appeared intoxicated from drinking that evening or cocaine she consumed that was provided by Winner.All said no, as government attorneys tried to establish that her accusation of rape was not fueled by alcohol or drugs.Winner's attorneys pressed prosecution witnesses, from police to doctors, about the alleged victim's state of mind and her sobriety after drinking and using cocaine.In a feisty exchange, Winner's lead attorney Steven Weinberg cross-examined the emergency room doctor who examined J.B.Weinberg asked Dr. Samuel Hayward, who was then working at UIC hospital, about the effects of cocaine."Certainly can lead to feelings of restlessness, correct?" asked Weinberg.It "can" replied Hayward tersely."And it can lead to angry outbursts...to paranoia" Weinberg said."It could" replied Hayward.And then Weinberg asked if "it affects one's ability to perceive?" and whether "perceptions get altered from drugs and cocaine?"Hayward replied that both are true.That exchange seemed to firm up what is becoming a prime tactic for the defense: build a picture of the victim as being under the influence the night of the alleged attack.Why a 2009 rape case is being prosecuted just now came into focus on Tuesday. The Chicago police detective assigned to the Winner investigation admitted she never followed up on DNA testing results from the state, highlighting archaic Illinois State Police communications with Chicago P.D. that resulted in Winner not being arrested for four years and the case not coming to trial for eight.The trial continues on Wednesday and Winner himself could take the stand on Thursday, with closing arguments as early as Friday.The ABC7 I-Team is recording audio of the courtroom proceedings and that is part of our continuing coverage of the Winner case.

Zach: Looking at both rosters, it's hard to point out a clear “advantage” for either team besides the Jaguars defensive line vs. the Buccaneers offensive line. The Jaguars pass rush will likely take a step forward this year with Yannick Ngakoue, Malik Jackson, Calais Campbell and Abry Jones leading the way. Sheldon Day and rookie Duwuane Smoot are both guys to keep our eyes on as rotational pieces, as well. While the Buccaneers have a solid interior offensive lineman in Ali Marpet, but he is taking on a new position at center and the rest of the line is a bit of a concern.

Talk about some fake news.A pizza man in Virginia is facing charges after he accused a pregnant woman and her boyfriend of armed robbery for demanding a refund on a messed up order.Noah Klein, 19, is charged with making a false report after he told his boss and then police that Kristina Crockett robbed him at gunpoint.Crockett said she and her boyfriend told Klein they wanted their money back after their pizza arrived late and in an inedible state."It looked like it had been kicked down a football field, and chunks of pizza were missing," Crockett toldCrockett, who is eight months pregnant, left to get some food, but she said what happened next really freaked her out.The woman found five officers with guns drawn on her boyfriend and cousin when she returned home."How do you get from returning a pizza and getting your money back to five cops and everybody is being separated and talked to and I can't go into my apartment?" Crockett said. "So, it was nervous and stressful."The York Poquoson Sheriff's Office says the driver was upset he had to return the pizza, so he filed the false report."With the report of an armed robbery allegedly occurring at that residence, we're going in with at least a mindset these people may be armed and we have to take precautions to make sure the citizens around that area are safe," said Deputy Dennis Ivey, Jr.Crockett said she was terrified knowing the pizza man's claim could have had serious consequences for her family.

Illinois Republicans botched four opportunities to stop an avowed Nazi from representing their party in a Chicago-area congressional district. Now they're paying the price.Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier who will appear on the November ballot as the GOP candidate against Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski, has become campaign fodder for Democrats as they seek to defeat Gov. Bruce Rauner. And some Republicans even fear the taint from Jones' extremist views poses a threat to the party up and down the ticket."First, it's morally wrong and I think it's really harmful to the party. The guy's a complete nutcase. He's a Nazi," said conservative GOP state Rep. David McSweeney. "This is an absolute political disaster."McSweeney's comments come justRunning a third-party candidate against Jones in November was among the options left to Illinois Republicans after Jones clinched the GOP nomination by running unopposed. But the deadline came and went this week and that didn't happen either.Jones, who told POLITICO he's running to counter a "two-party, Jew-party, queer-party system," laughed when he was informed the GOP was unable to put up a candidate against him."They didn't put up a third-party candidate?" Jones asked when reached by phone Thursday. "That's great! That's fantastic!"I snookered them," he said of state Republicans. "I played by the rules, what can I say?"Getting on the Illinois ballot as a third-party candidate is no small task. In the 3rd Congressional District, a candidate would have needed 14,600 valid signatures, a laborious and expensive endeavor and even then, there's a slim chance of success against Lipinski."There were several individuals interested in running as independent candidates, but unfortunately theyto mount a campaign in a district heavily favored for Democrats," Illinois Republican Party spokesman Aaron DeGroot said.On Thursday, DeGroot said the party instead plans to recruit and support a write-in candidate for the general election.Still, Jones' nomination has been an enormous embarrassment to the party - and to state party Chairman Tim Schneider - for months. When Schneider was faced with a formidable challenge to his chairmanship in May, some Republicans - including state Rep. Jeanne Ives, who ran unsuccessfully against Rauner in the primary - cited Jones' candidacy as a reason to break from Schneider's leadership. Schneider ended up surviving his challenge by bringing on his challenger as a co-chairman.Some have questioned why Republicans also failed to oust Jones through the traditional Illinois way of knocking undesirables off the ballot - by challenging his signature petitions. Both parties here commonly employ the tactic to bloody up each other.Democrats through petition challenges have more than once successfully sidelined a would-be Nazi candidate, Richard Mayers, who has attempted to run as a Green Party candidate in various congressional districts.J.B. Pritzker, the Democratic nominee for governor who was instrumental in building the Holocaust Museum in Skokie, has called on Rauner to urge Jones to drop out. Rauner has condemned Jones and said there's no room for him in American politics. But Pritzker said Rauner, who is the largest contributor to the Illinois GOP, hasn't done enough."Bruce Rauner has cowered to the worst elements of our politics on more than one occasion, but I sincerely hope he would agree that a self-proclaimed Nazi and Holocaust denier has no place as a candidate for any office in Illinois," Pritzker told POLITICO in a statement. "I urge Bruce Rauner to join me in calling on Arthur Jones to drop out."Yet the GOP never managed to offer those voters any alternative candidate to Jones."It's not enough to denounce Jones ... do something about it. They didn't run a candidate against him in the primary. They're not running against him in the general. And they're not endorsing Lipinski. Then what are they doing?" asked Steve Sheffey, a pro-Israel activist who authors a Jewish newsletter in Chicago. "From now on, at every forum, at every endorsement session, Illinois Republicans should be asked point blank: 'if you live in the 3rd Congressional District, who would you vote for: Dan Lipinski or Arthur Jones?"Underlying the inaction against Jones is ain November in the solidly Democratic district. Other Republicans have pointed to partisan gerrymandering as a barrier to recruiting viable GOP candidates in the 3rd District. Still, the party needed only 603 signatures to run someone against Jones in the first place and U.S. law does not require candidates to live in the congressional district for which they are running.Jones remains a long shot in the fall congressional race - he hasn't even filed a report with the Federal Election Commission or disclosed any donors, a move he said was intentional."I'm not filing any reports. I'm not going to give the Jews an opportunity to harass my supporters until after the election," he said. "Right now, I'm keeping all the names confidential."Asked how much money he raised, he said: "I'm not going to tell you."In the meantime, Republicans have one last chance to save face."They didn't run anyone against him in the primary. They didn't file an objection to him, they didn't find a write-in candidate and they didn't run an independent candidate," McSweeney said. "We've missed four opportunities. We better not miss the fifth."

Let's go back to the summer of 1985. The then 30-year-old Jobs was obnoxious and famously loose with the truth. He was a charismatic product pitchman but a terrible manager, producing the Macintosh late and way over-budget.

According to Walter Isaacson's biography Steve Jobs, they wanted the guy out. But Jobs, like Kalanick now, still had his seat on Apple's board.

For many years it was considered poor etiquette to roll your sleeves. Part of this was because it looked sloppy for an elegant gentleman to roll up his sleeves, part was due to the protection the shirt sleeve gave from the coarser fabric of the tailcoat or morning coat, and finally, it was because it really didn't make a difference. The coat worn over the shirt was far bulkier, and it was in poor taste to remove one's jacket before retiring at home.

Eisenhower was worried about the costs of an arms race with the Soviet Union, and the resources it would take from other areas — such as building hospitals and schools. Bowman says that in the speech, Eisenhower also spoke as someone who had seen the horror and lingering sadness of war, saying that "we must learn how to compose differences not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose." Another concern, Bowman says, was the possibility that as the military and the arms industry gained power, they would be a threat to democracy, with civilians losing control of the military-industrial complex.

While talking to this scribe, a tribal elder named Mohammad Ayaz Wazir said, “Farmers and local traders have been officially directed to deal only with businessmen belonging to Punjab province. But the tribesmen have refused the orders and instead they have loaded their produce of slender nut on trucks which will transport the goods to open markets of the country, including Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore and other major cities.” However, he said that all trucks were stopped by personnel of security forces at Tanai check post on the outskirts of Wana a couple of days ago. All the trucks were now stranded there since the past few days, thus causing widespread unrest among local traders and transporters, he added.
Replying to a query, Wazir said, “The newly constructed Agri Park has no facility for refining, preserving and storage of slender nuts and other dry/fresh fruits.” Under these circumstances, the tribesmen were reluctant to sell their products in the park to a single contractor, who with the help of the officials concerned was making attempts to monopolise trading activities in the area, he added. It is pertinent to mention here that the annual slender nut trading business is worth Rs 14 billion.
"At about a mile and a half into the race, the press truck went by us, and they saw that I was a woman in the race wearing numbers and they began taking pictures. And alongside of the photographer's truck came the officials' press truck. And the race director [Jock Semple] was on the truck and the guys were teasing him. "And he got so angry that there was a girl in the race that he stopped the bus and jumped off it and ran after me and attacked me in the race and tried to pull off my bib numbers, screaming at me, 'Get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers.' "And I was just blindsided by this. I was terrified. I was scared. And my boyfriend came along with a full streak and gave the official a cross-body block and sent him out of the race instead. You know, we laugh about it now because it's so funny when a girl is saved by her burly boyfriend. But ... I said to my coach immediately after the incident: 'I have to finish this race now because if I drop out of this race, nobody's going to believe that women are serious.' "
The FCC won't be appealing the court decision, as Chairman Ajit Pai opposed the rule changes when they were implemented by the commission's then-Democratic majority in 2015.

Virat Kohli was already one of the most promising Indian cricketers when he was appointed captain of India Under-19 for the 2008 World Cup.

Michigan State, which was second nationally in rushing defence and seventh in total defence, appears set to have another strong unit. The Spartans brought back 19 of 22 starters. Coach Mark Dantonio praised the spring performances of defensive linemen Mike Panasiuk, Raequan Williams and Kenny Willekes. Dantonio called Willekes, who had a team-leading seven sacks, a "force."
West Division champion Wisconsin, as usual, has an embarrassment of riches on the offensive line. That could allow Michael Deiter, who missed the spring with a leg injury, to go back to his preferred guard spot after playing left tackle in 2017. Deiter projects as an interior lineman in the NFL. Patrick Kasl or Cole Van Lanen would be in line to take over at left tackle.

The wind cooled warm nights and heated arguments in the vacant basketball court, but brought with it the cruel suggestion of rain. Games ran long into the nights, powered by malfunctioning lights and intense competition.

Nobody was safe in the confines of the court– from flying balls or thinly veiled sledging. Excuses are made to parents and girlfriends to stay that one game longer, to live in fantasy that one hour more.

World Cricket is used to seeing the best batsman of the team promoted to captaincy and doing extremely well. Take the case of Virat Kohli or Kane Williamson, both whom made a seamless transition to captaincy and in fact did a better job batting when captaining the side.
Root can push himself down to 4, where he has had great success and ask one of Jennings or Hameed to occupy the crucial no.3 spot. While it will be a huge test for the youngsters, having a technically correct batsman at three is a plus. If he can inspire them to good performances, England will have an answer to a long-standing issue.
The head of the Cabinet has already signed an order appointing Kulmatov the Chairman of the State Customs Service.
Congressman Neal discusses Kennedy's legacy Springfield - In a special lecture on Sunday, March 25 from 2 to 3 p.m., Congressman Richard E. Neal will discuss how John F. Kennedy's presidency has continued to inspire generations for individuals to run for office and to do good in their communities-most notably because of lasting impact of Kennedy's idealism.
This lecture also marks the end of the "Jack & Jackie: The Kennedy's in the White House" and the "Collecting Camelot: The Kennedy Era and its Collectibles" exhibits, which close Sunday, March 25. Because the Avedon photos will go into storage once they are returned to the Smithsonian, this is a particularly opportune time to come to the museums and celebrate the Kennedy legacy, by seeing the exhibits, hearing Congressman Neal's lecture, and attending the reception following the lecture.
In this special lecture at the Springfield Museums, Congressman Neal will explore Kennedy's relevance in our society today by highlighting how the young president harnessed the potential for progress in our country by initiating programs such as the Space Program, the Alliance for Progress, and the Peace Corps. Neal will pinpoint how Kennedy prioritized Civil Rights freedoms and recognized the benefits of Medicare coverage. Neal will celebrate how Kennedy broke one of the great religious barriers by becoming the first Catholic president. Most importantly, Congressman Neal will highlight Kennedy's dedication to the common good which was unwavering. This lecture is free with museum admission. All are invited to a reception to follow in the Wood Museum of Springfield History.
Probably the most wide-open of all awards, the National League Most Valuable Player Award has no clear front-runner, with players such as Marlins' outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, Reds' first baseman Joey Votto, Rockies' third baseman Nolan Arenado and Diamondbacks' first baseman Paul Goldschmidt as viable options.
Another option is Indians' third baseman Jose Ramirez. The extra-base hit machine has hit 27 home runs and an MLB-leading 51 doubles this season.
The Astros' second baseman has solidified himself as one of the top players in the game, leading the MLB with an 8.0 WAR. Altuve boasts an MLB-leading .345 average to go along with 24 home runs, 80 RBIs and 31 stolen bases.
One of the safest picks, Bellinger set the Dodgers' record for home runs in a season by a rookie, surpassing Mike Piazza's mark of 35 in 1993. The first baseman sports a .275 average while hitting 39 home runs and 94 RBIs.

Compile a list of every sex position you've ever tried. Then compare that list to every sex position you've heard of. Your sex life is going to come up a bit short, no pun intended. A new survey on DrEd got the low down on the world's favourite sex position, or at least the most frequently practiced one. Doggy style is in the lead winning 35.1 per cent of the vote as the go-to sex position. Which makes sense considering it's not as routine as missionary or as complex as the cheese grater (you're not ready for that one yet). Not to mention the view is pretty sweet and everyone's a winner. It's a classic. But then again so is vanilla. Number two on the list of most popular sex positions is missionary, with 22.5 per cent of the vote, followed by cowgirl at 19.4 per cent.

There continue to be questions about the substance behind the pending release of the House Intelligence Committee memo. With that release in mind, today it is worthwhile remembering this is the beginning of exposing the corruption within the DOJ not the end.For several years the U.S. justice department has maintained an attitude of non-accountability within its ranks. The Obama years elevated that attitude and provided multiple examples of a DOJ gone rogue.A complicit mediaby engineering a false narrative the U.S. Justice Department was/is an independent fourth branch of government; unaccountable to congress and entirely separate from the executive branch.The House Intelligence Memo is simply using the example of currently known FISA abuse to open the door and show the U.S. electorate how corrupt this unaccountable institution has become. Behind that door are very uncomfortable realities for all of those who constructed the weaponized agency; and also those who have benefited from it.Consider:♦When IRS head Lois Learner unlawfully sent the 21 CD-ROM's containing the "Schedule B" filings of over a million Americans to the Obama administration, the recipient was the DOJ. ( LINK in their " Secret Research Project ".♦When U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen demanded DOJ lawyers attend ethics classes due to their false representations to his court -♦When the case against the Bundy family was recently thrown out of court,highlighted by the judge. ( LINK This is the same DOJ who denied their own Office of Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, the right to conduct oversight on DOJ internal action. ( LINK - pdf ) The expressed Justice Department intent in every action has been. This is the pervasive attitude, an air of ideological unaccountability, found rampant within every corrupt system.So it doesn't come as a surprise when the epicenter of that attitude in Washington DC balks at the concept of having oversight, and thumbs their nose at congress by refusing to turn over the underlying FISA application documents.The House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Devin Nunes, has oversight over the entire intelligence apparatus, including DOJ/FBI counterintelligence and the FISA Courts. The House Judiciary Committee, Chairman Bob Goodlatte, has statutory oversight over the entire Department of Justice. The Senate Judiciary Committee, Chairman Chuck Grassley, has oversight over the federal court processes used by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Office of Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, is the internal DOJ watchdog.Unfortunately the corruption appears systemic within the entire justice system. This is the problem currently being confronted.. The American people became the threat to their system. The American people became their enemy. This outlook sounds stark, but this is exactly the way the DOJ has behaved.We The People are in an abusive relationship with the Department of Justice.Representative Mark Meadows puts it thusly The release of the House Intelligence Memo is only the tip of the iceberg; the crack in the door to see just how corrupt the unaccountable Justice System became.There are going to be many more revelations as the investigations into the FBI and DOJ continue. Combine that understanding with the pending OIG Horowitz report, and we have only just begun to see how bad this is...The key aspect to begin restoring a system when it has fallen into the clutches of corruption, is to remove their internal image of unaccountability. The DOJ and FBI are part of the Executive Branch. We need to constantly remind people of that, and push back against this insufferable media-generated narrative of the DOJ being an independent fourth branch of government.

We are getting reports this morning of a shooting just outside Washington, D.C. A gunman opened fire on a group of Republican lawmakers and staffers who were practicing for a charity baseball game in Arlington, Va., this morning. Congressman Steve Scalise was shot and is in stable condition. Several others were injured. Mo Brooks is a congressman from Alabama. Here's how he described the scene on CNN.
MARTIN: That shooting in Alexandria, Va., this morning - and that was Congressman Mo Brooks speaking on CNN this morning.
MARTIN: Some have suggested on Twitter this morning that the only reason the Capitol Police were even at that baseball practice is because Congressman Scalise is - was there, that that detail travels with him.
MARTIN: Again, if you're just joining us, we're getting reports of a shooting outside Washington, D.C., in Alexandria, Va. Several people have been shot, including Congressman Steve Scalise, who was reportedly shot in the hip and is now in stable condition. And Tamara, at least a couple other staffers have been shot at this point, we're hearing.
KEITH: That is what we're hearing. Most of this is coming from Congressman Mo Brooks, who appeared on CNN. He was there, and he described the scene. He described applying a tourniquet to someone. This is a very frightening scene. I can also just add that Press Secretary Sean Spicer says that both the president and Mike Pence are aware of this and are watching and paying attention and following the updates.
MARTIN: Obviously, this is a breaking news story, and we will continue to bring you details as we learn them. Again, there has been a shooting outside of Washington, D.C. This happened at a congressional baseball practice ahead of a charity game that was scheduled to happen tomorrow. At least several Republican staffers have been shot. We don't have exact numbers. We do know that Congressman Steve Scalise, the No. 3 in Congress, has been shot - in the House. He has been shot in the hip, although he is in stable condition. We can also tell you that the suspect in this shooting has been arrested and is in police custody.
Seeking the arrest of Lee for a second time, the prosecutors also asked the court to issue a writ for Samsung Electronics President Park Sang-jin over his involvement in the alleged irregularities, according to the probe team.The court will hold a hearing on Thursday 10:30 a.m. to decide the legality of their detention.The investigation team said more criminal charges have been leveled against Lee compared to the last time it sought his arrest.It declined to elaborate further, saying its spokesman will give more details during a regular press briefing on Wednesday afternoon.Prosecutors accused Lee of giving or promising some 43 billion won ($36.3 million) worth of bribes to the president's jailed friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the state-run pension fund's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015.The business arrangement was seen as critical for the smooth management succession of the group from ailing Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong.The Samsung scion has denied the allegations raised against him.Lee was questioned for a second time on Monday, as the special prosecutors accelerated their probe into an influence-peddling scandal centered on President Park, with the investigation deadline slated for Feb. 28. The period can be extended once for a month with the consent of Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn. (Yonhap)
The Korn frontman has detailed his forthcoming full-length solo debut, Black Labyrinth, set for release on May 25.
The company is at the top of Lotte's Japanese affiliates via a cobweb-like ownership structure and holds 19 percent stake in Hotel Lotte Co., a de facto holding firm of the group's Korean units.If the board decides not to extend Shin's term, the 94-year-old will likely be removed from his post following the shareholders meeting slated for later this month.Earlier this month, the country's top court confirmed the designation of a nonprofit subsidiary of a law firm as the guardian of Shin, efficiently backing his second son and group Chairman Shin Dong-bin's argument that his father lacks the mental capacity to make meaningful decisions.The petition seeking guardianship over Shin was filed in December 2015 by the group founder's younger sister amid a bitter feud between his two sons over the managerial control of the group.While the elder son, Shin Dong-joo, claimed that the founder handpicked him as the successor for the retail group, Dong-bin insisted that his father was unable to make reasonable judgments due to mental health problems.The family feud virtually came to an end after the incumbent chairman won shareholder support in March last year to tighten his grip on the group.While Chairman Shin was caught up in the leadership battle, his whole family, including the founder, was put on trial on multiple corporate crime allegations. The conglomerate is also implicated in a graft scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye and her friend.The 94-year-old Shin has lost his board seats at Lotte's key affiliates as his tenure ended. The only company where he works as director now is Lotte Aluminium, but the tenure is also slated to end in August unless it is extended."We do have a shareholder meeting scheduled, but the results can be confirmed only after all the procedures are completed," a Lotte official said.

"We don't want it in our game. We want a clean game. It sometimes is disappointing in seeing guys still trying to use performance-enhancing drugs," second baseman Brian Dozier said on Monday as the Twins started their final full week of spring training. "But at the same time, when it comes to a guy on my team, that's my brother. He needs love right now. That's the only thing I'm really worried about."
Aybar, who has begun his 12th major league season, was signed to a minor league contract last month, before the Twins knew about Polanco's pending suspension. There's also some uncertainty about the availability of third baseman Miguel Sano, though to a much lesser degree than the half-season Polanco will be absent for. Sano is being investigated by Major League Baseball for alleged harassment of a freelance photographer after an autograph signing in 2015, and he's also recovering from surgery on his shin.

Hyundai Motor's unionized workers will stage three or four strikes over five consecutive days starting Monday, as it failed to meet halfway with management over raises and job security.Starting with a three-hour partial walkout, workers at car manufacturing plants and auto parts factories are scheduled to stage four-hour partial strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, the union said.The entire labor union will continue four-hour partial strikes Thursday and Friday.The union has demanded a 154,883 won ($142) raise in base monthly pay, a bonus worth 30 percent of last year's net profit and stronger job security.Hyundai's management has so far suggested a raise of 42,879 won and bonuses of 250 percent.Stepping up its push for higher wages, the union said it plans to hold strikes in front of Hyundai Chairman Chung Mong-koo's house in central Seoul.“Hyundai Motor will handle the walkout according to principles,” Hyundai Motor said.Strikes by Hyundai workers are estimated to affect production of some 43,000 vehicles, for about 890 billion won in losses.Continued walkouts will inevitably delay the supply of Kona SUVs that were set for release in the US in the first half of 2018, Hyundai Motor added.The compact SUV Kona was introduced to US drivers at the LA Motor Show last month with aims to boost sales there.Hyundai Motor posted a net profit of 939.2 billion won between July and September this year, down 16 percent on-year largely due to poor sales in China and the US.By Kim Bo-gyung (lisakim425@heraldcorp.com)

The Colorado fans didn't have to wait long to see one. Just eight seconds into the first round, literally after the customary touch of gloves, Irvin clocked Alexander with a clean superman punch, dropping him to the ground. One follow-up punch missed its target but the second landed flush on Alexander's chin, stiffening him up and forcing the referee to stop the fight.
The finish has since been eclipsed by a superior superman punch from Travis Browne, but it's still one of the best knockouts I've ever seen purely for the speed of it. At the time, this tied the fastest official knockout in UFC history. As it's only eight seconds long there's no excuse for not checking it out!

"They are small fish," Ranatunga said referring to the groundsman of the Galle stadium, Tharanga Indika, and a district coach, Tharindu Mendis.
Asked if the Galle groundsman was in a position to tamper with the pitch, Ranatunga said: "There is a top guy involved. He should be held responsible. He should be suspended, not only the person who got (directly) involved." Ranatunga said the global audience for cricket was declining because of corruption allegations. He blamed the ICC.

Would the Browns make the trade: I don't see it happening. The Browns do not want to trade down. They've had a bad history in trading away from picks going all the way back to the draft they passed on receiver Julio Jones. Though John Dorsey has given every indication he'll listen, it's hard to see him making a move down when he has two premium picks. Arizona has the 15th overall, so perhaps the Cardinals could make the move with that pick and a couple of second-round choices, to start. But the Browns have three picks in the second round already, so I'm not sure what they'd gain by moving to 15 because they would lose a premier player, like defensive lineman Bradley Chubb of North Carolina State. Dorsey has made it clear he would listen to all trade offers. He said he's gotten some calls. But he hasn't made a deal. That tells me the price for these picks in this draft is pretty steep. I don't see the Browns doing it. -- McManamon
Would the Giants make the trade: Probably not. Only if it were for a boatload. And only if the Giants were then able to parlay their newfound assets into a move back into the top 10, perhaps for a shot at Notre Dame offensive lineman Quenton Nelson. The Cardinals are really going to have to make it worth it for the Giants to even consider moving down. The 15th pick is likely too far. -- Raanan

South Korea's anti-trust watchdog is under mounting pressure to scrap its long-held exclusive right to charge businesses for fair trade violations which opposition lawmakers say have been impotent to monitor chaebol's unlawful practices against smaller firms.The current law prevents prosecutors from indicting companies for competition law violations unless the Fair Trade Commission files an accusation.Rep. Choi Woon-yeol of the Democratic Party of Korea and Rep. Chae Yi-bae of the People's Party have proposed their respective revision bills to scrap the FTC's exclusive right to charge businesses, claiming the FTC has been excessively lenient to big firms in evaluating their competition law violations.“Maybe because of the conglomerates' contribution to the local economy, the FTC has not been using its right to charge chaebol as much as it needed to,” Choi told The Korea Herald.But he also admitted that with or without the role of the FTC, the SMEs' heavy reliant on conglomerates fundamentally make it hard for them to take any action in case of unfair businesses.“Small companies in partnership with conglomerates find it virtually impossible to press charges against conglomerates (with the FTC) because they fear conglomerates could end their contract,” Choi said.The National Assembly's National Policy Committee will hold a hearing on Monday next week where the ruling and opposition lawmakers and the FTC will reveal their respective stance on the issue. After revision bill evaluations, the committee will decide on the fate of the FTC's right on Feb. 24.Opposing to scrapping its right to charge, the FTC said in a report submitted to the Assembly on Wednesday that it could create bigger damage to small and medium-sized enterprises.Proponents of the FTC's exclusive right also claim that the opposition lawmakers' move is politically motivated to stress their agenda of chaebol reform without in-depth evaluation and alternatives for the system.“We take thousands of accusing reports from small and medium companies per year. After evaluating with our own expertise, we file accusations with prosecutors only those considered as ‘grave,'” an FTC official said on the condition of anonymity.“Over 80 percent accusations we receive come from conflicts between SMEs or between small vendors. If FTC's right is scrapped, those individuals might abuse suing SMEs, whose business activities will be in peril to deal with legal issues.”The FTC, for its part, has been contending that it no longer holds the “exclusive right” since June 2013, citing how a system was introduced then to allow other entities to demand the FTC take action in cases of unfair businesses.So far, the Board of Audit and Inspection, Public Procurement Service and the Small and Medium Business Administration can request the FTC to file a case with the prosecution, and when such a request is filed, the FTC is obligated to follow through.FTC officials contend that expanding the scope of this system would suffice.Reports said that the FTC is reviewing a proposal to also include Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Korea Federation of SMEs in the list as an alternative to having its exclusive right completely revoked.The issue comes at a time when the watchdog is under investigation by the special counsel over whether the FTC allegedly gave a favor to Samsung Group in 2015 when it had to weaken its shareholding chains in the wake of the merger of its two affiliates Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries in July of that year.In December 2015, the FTC ordered smartphone battery maker Samsung SDI to dispose 5 million Samsung C&T shares, instead of its original ruling of 10 million shares. The FTC reducing the amount of shares could be interpreted as a favor to Samsung, news reports said.FTC Chairman Jeong Jae-chan, as well as Vice Chairman Kim Hak-hyun, were called in by the special counsel on Feb. 10 and Feb. 8, respectively, for questioning over the FTC's decision over Samsung C&T shares.By Kim Yoon-mi (yoonmi@heraldcorp.com)

And several multimedia installations provided by ICON Media, including a fascinating touchscreen timeline that dates back to the opening of Massey Hall and covers many of Yonge St.'s lamented long-closed venues: the Colonial Tavern, the Edison Hotel, the Coq d'Or, the Hawk's Nest, the Town Tavern and the Eaton Auditorium (now the Carlu) among them. But it wasn't just rock 'n' roll and jazz that were embraced by the city during that time period: R&B, country and even Caribbean music also enjoyed significant followings. “Yonge St. was a place where Afro-American and Caribbean artists played alongside white musicians, and where female performers such as Shirley Matthews and Dianne Brooks and even a (transgender artist) like Jackie Shane could all become stars,” noted Nick Jennings via email from Berlin. “It's the first time a curated exhibit has showcased this little-known side of the city's rich music history: the bands on Yonge St. that gave Toronto an identifiable sound in the 1960s. More is known about the singer-songwriters of Yorkville, but Yonge had it all — folk, blues, jazz, country, rock and rhythm & blues — and that hasn't been explored in this way before. Toronto really needs its own music museum and this project is a great start.” Musicians aren't the only ones featured in the display, stuffed with contributions from individual donors, and the archives of Haust and Jennings: there's a section devoted to CHUM and the numerous DJs — including Duff Roman and the late Bob McAdorey — who played significant roles in the listening habits of Toronto youth back in the day, and even the menus of certain nightspots. “We try to capture and describe an era, not only of this club, but when this club was around radio was flying,” Haust recalls. “And the DJ was your friend at night when you're doing homework, listening to him on a small transistor radio with one earbud.” Roman's contributions are particularly crucial to the development of the “Toronto Sound”: as the owner of Roman Records, the future Canadian Music Hall of Fame member recorded the Hawks, the Paupers and future Blood, Sweat & Tears frontman David Clayton-Thomas, encouraging them to write their own material, predating the eventual implementation of protectionist Can-con legislation. “What we have here is a museum statement about prelegislated culture,” Haust explains. “It's one thing to have a hit record once Canadian radio is required by law to play 30 per cent content and it's entirely a different thing for Duff Roman to take David Clayton-Thomas to the studio on the money he was making on sock hops, and record Top 10 hits ‘Walk That Walk' and ‘Brain Washed.' That's a pioneering foundation.” The Friar's Music Museum, free to the public, may be small, but it's a big win for preserving local history, thanks to Mark Garner, executive director of the Downtown Yonge BIA, who persuaded Shoppers franchise owner Andrew Yeh to pony up a significant amount of this prime downtown retail space, valued at approximately $200 per square foot. “You've got a better chance of splitting an atom in your basement than accomplishing what we've accomplished,” joked Garner in an interview. Garner considers the Friar's museum the latest step in an effort to boost Toronto music tourism, previously complemented by building murals, Nick Jennings' walking tours and book Before the Gold Rush, Jan Haust's documentary project Yonge Street: Toronto Rock & Roll Stories, and numerous historical plaques. “This is the flagship,” Garner says of the museum. “We are working on other micro museums all the way along Yonge St. to preserve the cultural heritage. “This is a neighbourhood that's gentrifying quickly. Right now, it's still living history, so we have to strike while the iron's hot.”

I was the last guy they brought in, and there were maybe 12 receivers there. When you do the numbers thing, I was out.”
Hendricks had to be on his game as Nationals star Stephen Strasburg was even better -- at least through the first five innings. A sixth-inning error by third baseman Anthony Rendon opened the door for the Cubs to score two runs on their first two hits of the night. Strasburg struck out 10 before leaving -- but Hendricks would outshine the NL pitcher of the month for September.
Hendricks, the 2016 MLB ERA leader, gave up just two hits and three walks, and was able to pitch around an error by his own third baseman in his final inning of work. Hendricks was masterful, working both sides of the plate with some of the best movement on his pitches he's had all season. Every time he needed to make a pitch, he did.

The pitcher really is the pitcher; once he comes into a game, he must face at least one batter before he can be replaced by another pitcher. The catcher really is the catcher; he has to set up in the area behind home plate, and if he's not in that area when the pitch is delivered, the pitcher is charged with a balk. And the first baseman really is the first baseman, as he is the only player allowed to wear a special glove. There are rules about where these guys can stand.
On Monday, when Joey Votto batted in the fifth inning of the Cincinnati Reds' 15-5 loss to the Chicago Cubs, opposing manager Joe Maddon decided to go off book. He sent his third baseman Kris Bryant into the outfield:
He doubled right past first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who might very well have been shaded that one extra step over if the Cubs had used a regular infield shift instead. Of course, the "regular" infield shift used to be considered pretty irregular, even radical. Nowadays, when the third baseman jogs over and stands in shallow right field, almost as far away from third base as he can go without getting light-headed, nobody even blinks. Third base is just a suggestion.
Okorocha, who is also the Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), used the opportunity to correct the impression that APC is not recognised in the South East.

"We understand that a few Grand Manan fishermen were approached by the United State Border Services during the month of June. Our understanding is that this was a part of a regular exercise being conducted along the U.S. marine border."
We're familiar with the standard masked rapist of fiction. As Kate notes at one point, "Juries are keen to convict the predatory rapist, the archetypal bogeyman down a dark alley, yet when it comes to relationship rape, they'd really rather not know, thank you very much." This is only just beginning to change, and Vaughan's novel is interesting because it features a serial rapist who doesn't seem to know he is one. Moreover, his victims had been attracted to him and did consent (or would have) to sex in other circumstances — meaning Anatomy of a Scandal is balanced on the edge of our shifting attitudes towards rape.

The scenario unfolded when Pirates pitcher Joe Musgrove slid hard into second base in the bottom of the fourth inning, popping back up and into second baseman Javier Baez, who was about to attempt a throw to first for a double play. He never got the throw off as the two players had words which amounted to very little, even though both benches and bullpens cleared. The play opened the door for Maddon to challenge the slide -- which he thought was legal anyway.
His comments were in regard to a play on Monday when first baseman Anthony Rizzo slid into catcher Elias Diaz attempting to break up a home-to-first double play. The umpires deemed it a legal slide but the league reversed that ruling on Tuesday, infuriating Maddon. It turned out the Musgrove slide wasn't reviewable because Baez never attempted to make a throw to first base.

The play really began right around the 2:05 mark, when Golden Knights defenseman Shea Theodore gained the red line coming up the left side of the ice and dumped the puck deep to initiate the forecheck, as Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury ascended to the hashmarks in preparation of leaving the ice for an extra skater. Three Capitals skaters retreated backward, as Eakin slipped up the right side. As the puck wrung around the boards in the left corner, it careened awkwardly out in front of the net, rather than wrapping all the way around.

Since making the leap into acting at the urging of Robert Altman, when the director was filming in Texas while she was attending Southern Methodist University and was a member of the NFL's Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, Shahi has worked in a variety of different roles. The Texas native recently was a series regular on Person of Interest, plus she's appeared in TV series such as The L Word, Chicago Fire, The Sopranos, Ray Donovan and Alias. Her feature film roles include Bullet to the Head, I Don't Know How She Does It, Old School and Hangman. None of those parts pushed her imagination to the extremes of working on Reverie. Each week, her character enters a new world that can be stunningly beautiful or painfully frightening. “I have been describing this show as Alice in Wonderland meets Deception. A lot of the show feels like Alice falling down the rabbit hole because she never knows where she's going to end up,” Shahi says. “Every episode of this show is its own ride. “You just never know where it is going to take you.” In the series opener, Kint joins the dream of a man who keeps reliving a moment associated with his marriage proposal. What appears to be a very sweet and special memory is hiding a darker element Kint uncovers. The story is the first of 10 episodes in the summer series, which also airs on Global. Shahi is happy Reverie is starting now rather than in the fall because it will have a better chance at snagging an audience when there is less competition. The cast of Reverie also includes Dennis Haysbert, Sendhil Ramamurthy, Kathryn Morris and Jessica Lu.

Houston DT Ed Oliver: Wake up, people. Everyone sleeps on the Group of 5 needs to turn on the tape of Houston's prodigious defensive lineman and soak it in. The 6-foot-3, 290-pound sophomore does things that no 6-3, 290-pound person should be able to do. Even from the interior of the line, he makes plays. Just look at his stat line the past two seasons: 135 tackles, 37.5 tackles for loss, 10.5 sacks, 12 passes defended, five forced fumbles and one blocked kick. If the Heisman voters sleep on him, you'd better believe the owners of the No. 1 pick in the 2019 NFL draft won't.

In the 1990s, Korea's popular culture begin to expand overseas, mostly to other Asian countries. It was during this time that the government begin emphasizing the potential of culture industry.The term Hallyu (Korean wave), which was coined by the Chinese media in 2000 to describe the onslaught of Korean dramas and pop songs there, was quickly adopted by Korea too to refer to Korean entertainment content. Today, it is used to describe a gamut of content and products of Korean origin.As Koreans reflect upon the past two decades of Hallyu, a question on people‘s minds is, how long will it last?Tracing back to the dawn of Hallyu, one unexpectedly encounters Steven Spielberg's “Jurassic Park.”A year after the 1993 film's release, the presidential advisory committee reported to then-President Kim Young-sam that the movie had made about $850 million in one year, roughly equivalent to the profit earned by selling 1.5 million cars.Shocked by such numbers, the committee concluded that promoting the culture industry could be the most proficient way to maximize profit.Since then Korea has turned from a pop culture importer to an exporter.According to Korea Creative Content Agency, the country exported roughly $5.66 billion worth of content and imported $1.18 billion worth of content last year.In 2013, a Hollywood remake of director Park Chan-wook's gruesome revenge thriller “Oldboy” was unveiled, with director Spike Lee at the helm. Smash hit drama “Guardian” was recently aired on Japanese TV, having reportedly been sold for over $200,000 per episode.Millions of tourists visit Korea each year, a considerable number of them Hallyu fans.Kanae Tanaka, 53, a tourist from Osaka, Japan, said she became fascinated with Korea after watching the 2002 drama “Winter Sonata,” and has visited the country nearly 50 times.Even with China's recent ban on Korean content, its popularity remains strong.“Guardian,” although it was not officially exported to China, was searched more than 3.2 billion times on Weibo, Chinese social networking service.“I was used to dealing with J-pop. It was a lot similar (to K-pop), but that was back in the day. Now I feel like K-pop is dominating Asia,” said Dutch DJ Ferry Corsten, one of the most prominent figures in the trance music scene.Having worked with K-pop artists Amber and Luna, Corsten is planning to do more work with S.M. Entertainment artists later this year.With Hallyu reaching a wider spectrum of fans, there has been concern over insensitivity to people of different cultures.Such concern materialized last month in a depiction of the Islamic culture in the MBC drama “Man Who Dies to Live.”In what was intended as a comical caricature, the creators depicted the Islamic tradition in a way that was inaccurate and offensive to some viewers.“Depicting Islamic culture in a drama wasn't wrong or needs apologizing. But depicting it wrongly is what offended the Muslims,” said one disgruntled reader of The Korea Herald.“The drama is a classic case of a ‘Galapagos syndrome' of Korean drama,” said Cho Won-hee, a culture critic and movie director.As the producers are accustomed to making dramas for a mainly Korean audience, they would have been unaware of what may be offensive to people of other cultures, Cho pointed out.Cho went on to say that the limitations of Hallyu does not stop at such accidental and unintended offensive depictions.He raised doubts on whether diversifications of genres in Korean dramas will do well with foreign fans, who fell in love with romance-driven Hallyu dramas like “Winter Sonata.”“More diverse dramas are popping up, most recently “Stranger” that was a big hit in Korea. ... I don't think foreign fans fell in love with ‘these kinds of' dramas,” he said.“When you look at how Hallyu is depicted in countries like Malaysia, you can see what they think Hallyu is: a story mainly about a devoted couple expressing their love to each other.“This kind of dramas have passed their prime in Korea. Korean fans will keep on searching for new types of dramas, while foreign fans will have different opinions. It will be hard to cater to both spectrum of fans,” he said.Last month, President Moon Jae-in said he plans to increase the number of Hallyu fans to 100 million in the next five years. The number of Hallyu fans today is estimated to be around 60 million.However, local cultural figures said that such an approach derives from a lack of understanding on how pop culture works.Writer Son A-ram told local media that focusing on already-established forms of pop culture would be like “fertilizing the fruit, instead of the root.”“If everyone made the same content, diversification of culture takes a hit. You never know which underground artists may grow to create a multi-billion dollar market,” he said.Director Cho said the best tactic for creating content that appeals to a foreign audience is to focus on each individual content, not treating it as part of an international phenomenon that is Hallyu.“BTS is a good example. The boyband is not popular because it is Korean artists; it is popular because its music and concept appeal to the international audience. The same with Psy (in 2012),” he said.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)

This is yet another manifestation of sincerity of Chinese leadership in extending a helping hand to restore peace in war-torn Afghanistan. In fact, this is in line with the overall strategy of China, which believes in development-oriented and cooperative diplomacy as is reflected by launching of historic initiative of One Belt, One Road. China and Pakistan are in advance stages of implementation of CPEC and peace, stability in Afghanistan could have positive impact on the overall situation. China is also part of the quadrilateral Afghan peace process, which currently is suspended, and there are reports that Chinese Foreign Minister would also discuss the possibility of revival of this process. However, much depends on the attitude of Afghan government and new US administration, which is close to announcing its Afghanistan policy. So far Afghan government is not reciprocating to cooperative and goodwill gestures from Pakistan side and is playing into the hands of India, which has its own axe to grind. As for US administration is concerned, Defence Secretary James Mattis has hinted that the new policy would take into account regional situation especially impact of rivalry between Pakistan and India on situation in Afghanistan. Pakistan has been sensitising Washington that India should not be given responsibilities of watchman in Afghanistan as it has no credentials to play the role honestly. It is using Afghan soil against Pakistan and evidence in this regard has been shared with the United States. In this backdrop, the only option to deal with the problem would be to increase cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan and President Ghani should respond positively to the Beijing mediation offer.

The blog-osphere hasn't spoken this much about That's So Raven since the early aughts! It seems that actor Orlando Brown has a sex tape out that shows him in a rather explicit situation with a girlfriend of sorts, but the latest rumors suggest that the That's So Raven star released the tape to drum up some much-needed publicity for himself! Why did I have to be nosey and see why Orlando Brown was trending pic.twitter.com/vUcxYI5jGy — Kelvin Hampton Jr. (@imkelvinjr) January 2, 2017 According to BET, the Orlando Brown sex tape was “leaked” by none other than the actor himself. While many fans have been speculating about the actor's well-being since he began making the rounds of the gossip columns on account of his alleged relationship with Raven Symone, they became equally concerned — and amused — when the dirty video started making the rounds on Instagram. Me when I saw Orlando Brown was trending vs when I found out what he was trending for pic.twitter.com/wWgOMDctON — ????Alex$us???? (@RedLipSnake) January 2, 2017 Naturally, the video was reported and deleted shortly after it went up, but since nothing ever dies on the Internet, it wasn't long before fans copied and distributed the tape on their own sites, thus causing the blog-osphere to sit up and take notice. “ORLANDO BROWN IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL” @THESLUMPGOD pic.twitter.com/VUHpdxv1Am — TAKEASTEPBACK (@HeroinWifey) December 23, 2016 The Orlando Brown sex tape is just the latest bit of news that has given fans cause to pause about the young actor's true state of mind. According to TMZ, earlier last year, he was arrested for domestic violence. The outlet reports that this incident occurred in a police station parking lot, and when the actor was arrested, he was found to have meth on him! Furthermore, though his girlfriend was not seriously harmed by the beating, Brown was charged with two felonies because of the presence of meth. He was charged with drug possession with intent to sell, and having contraband while in jail. Finally, and perhaps worst of all, this domestic violence arrest wasn't the first time Brown was charged with domestic violence. In 2014, he struck a plea deal for threatening a woman with harm, and paid a substantial fine. Sounds like someone has some serious issues with violence against women! How tf does Orlando Brown have a “wifey”? pic.twitter.com/oUQC2umBX3 — Santiago (@_ForeverZealous) December 23, 2016 Naturally, when the Orlando Brown sex tape got released, Twitter immediately exploded with reactions to the rather explicit content, causing the actor to become a worldwide trending topic.

A sex tape, if you want to call it that, of the struggle actor who can't seem to stop talking about Raven Symone hit the Internets, and the reaction is what you would expect. That is, slander, disgust and plenty of loathing aimed at the That's So Raven actor. Did we mention that he “leaked” this sex tape himself? Twitter previously debated exactly which drugs Brown is on. Is ‘All of them' a proper answer?” But it seems as though Orlando Brown is trying to promote his rising rap career with his latest scandals.

Nuclear brinksmanship is back and it is faceoff time. America with its power supremacy has its weapons idling, waiting for the other side to make a move — diplomatically or militarily. The hope and calculation is that Kim's twitchy trigger finger can be effectively stilled by a future-oriented survivalist Chinese leader who values the global commons. The stakes are whether Xi and the world survive unscathed.
However, he hasn't got the opportunity to prove himself despite being one of India's best T20 batsmen of all-time. At 30, all is not yet lost for Raina, but he will be hoping that he gets his chance sooner rather than later.

The prosecutor's office began investigating suspected tax evasion after the tax agency questioned whether Chairman Cho paid tax on overseas assets inherited from his father, Yonhap News Agency reported earlier on Thursday.
Chairman Cho earlier this month stepped down from the post of co-chief executive at Jin Air Co Ltd, shortly after authorities considered cancelling the budget affiliate's licence because Cho's younger daughter had been a board member despite being a U.S. national, a potential contravention.
Separately, South Korean police on Thursday sought an arrest warrant for Chairman Cho's wife, Lee Myung-hee, for charges including assault, Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said.
After losing four wickets for not much on the board, the two best batsmen of Sri Lanka - Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, put together a patient partnership of 65 runs. However, both batsmen got out in quick succession looking to play attacking shots.
It was the same story on day 3 as all the batsmen lacked intent and threw away their wickets. Things are not looking good for the future of Sri Lankan cricket at the moment.
Rehder says, “It's a tremendous event to display the beef industry and how we want to work with people and the Ronald McDonald Houses, I can't think of a better way to do that then the way they help families when families are in need.” Alec Gotto of Dyersville won the People's Choice Award, a young man who shows while in an electric wheelchair. Iowa Secretary of Ag Bill Northey were the showmanship winner.
Tranter, formerly the frontman of Semi Precious Weapons, has had issues with the music industry, and consequently now prefers to work behind-the-scenes rather than on stage. “This business has proven to be just as racist, transphobic, homophobic and misogynistic as the rest of the world, so that's the obvious challenge [for Shea],” Tranter tells Variety. “The more subtle challenge is that most people don't want people who've actually experienced the hardest hardships singing about them because it's too real. They'd prefer a white, straight, cis ‘ally' singing and speaking about it because it makes them less uncomfortable. But those days are over, honey. The truth should come from the source.”
Similar models of multi-songwriter egalitarianism are fairly few and far between. Two that come to mind – Sloan and Teenage Fanclub – have maintained impressive quality control over lengthy careers without ever succumbing to the easier marketing path of highlighting a single frontman for the world. RBCF seems similarly equipped to hold egos in check and come to think of it, Teenage Fanclub isn't a bad reference point for their shiny, hooky tunes tinged with just a hint of melancholy.

Kids who love winter weather who want to have one last snowball fight or cobble together a snowman will have to act quickly. “Certainly, getting snowfall through March and even through good chunks of April, it's not too unusual and the good thing is with any of these spring snowfalls, they usually don't last too long,” Curtis says. “It's the same with this one. When it falls, it'll likely be gone within a couple of days.” Some Iowans are already seeing green tulip and daffodil chutes emerge from the cold ground and that tender vegetation could get nipped.

BAGHDAD—A suicide bomber driving a pickup loaded with explosives struck a bustling market in Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 36 people in an attack claimed by Daesh hours after French President François Hollande arrived in the Iraqi capital.The bomb went off in a fruit and vegetable market that was packed with day labourers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded.During a press conference with Hollande, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the bomber pretended to be a man seeking to hire day labourers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle.Daesh, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a militant website often used by the extremists. It was the third Daesh-claimed attack in as many days in and around Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the group despite a string of setbacks elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul.The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.Article Continued BelowShiite militiamen loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr, the firebrand cleric for whose family the neighbourhood is named, were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Dead bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and labourers' shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire.Asaad Hashim, an owner of a mobile phone store nearby, described how the labourers pushed and shoved around the bomber's vehicle, trying to get hired.“Then a big boom came, sending them up into the air,” said the 28-year old, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed “the most ineffective security forces in the world” for failing to prevent the attack.

So does the success of players like Mike Lee. The New Orleans native was supposed to be a four-star safety in the 2017 recruiting class. He instead made the rare move to enroll at Kansas a year early. He became one of the Big 12's most productive freshmen in a year when he should've been a high school senior.
It will take a few more Louisiana kids shining for Hull to maintain this pipeline he's building. The Jayhawks already have Lee, Alabama transfer WR Daylon Charlot and backup QB Tyriek Starks (a Warren Easton grad), plus incoming freshmen Travis Jordan and Takulve Williams. Hull hopes they help more kids realize they can leave SEC country and still thrive.
The information minister earlier welcomed all the sports journalists in the 20th Annual AIPS ASIA Congress held in Islamabad on Friday. Addressing on the occasion, Marriyum said: “I am highly delighted to witness AIPS ASIA top management arrived in Pakistan. It is a historic occasion, as Pakistan is hosting such a high-profile event for the very first time. Pakistanis are sports loving nation and our sportsmen have won laurels for the country in different disciplines of sports and even reined the world in squash, hockey, cricket, tennis, athletics, badminton, snooker, chess and a number of other sports.”

At a candidate forum for Democrats preparing to challenge Congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York, the youngest woman in Congress, one of the candidates proclaimed, “I probably deserve to be called a sexist,” did not back down from calling the congresswoman “a little girl” and went on to call her “a child.”
These include Prof Prossy Bantebya, Flavia Tushabe, Grace Lubega, Ngubiri, Dr. Rehema Baguma etc. From UMI, he lured Dr. Benon Basheka who became VC but has since fallen out with him. He also targeted MUBS and took Dr. Joseph Sewanyana who became Chairman UTAMU Council before acrimoniously falling out after Barya insisted to knife some members of staff who disagreed with his views.
“His plan was to continue micromanaging UTAMU through Kinyera but we refused and bad blood started. He ceased to be VC and became Chairman BOD but kept particular interest in the finance department. We became more suspicious and Prof Basheka couldn't believe this is the Barya he knew. He started telling us the man has changed,” says a UTAMU insider.
As Chairman BOD, Barya tried to get the UTAMU Appointments Board members to recruit his man Peter Kinyera as Finance Manager and sole signatory to all UTAMU operations accounts. The others opposed it saying this was a plot to push Kinyera in top management to spy for Barya. Barya wanted Kinyera to earn Shs6m per month but the others refused arguing more qualified PhD holders weren't earning even a half of that. Barya drafted Kinyera's appointment letter but others refused to recognize it.
On learning of all this, Prof Fred Kayanja (former MUST VC) whom Barya had previously recruited as UTAMU Chairman became very disappointed and vowed to quit but Basheka begged him to stay fearing the bad press his departure would create.
All three will serve as executive producers on the project, with Barris and Bean also serving as showrunners and writers.

As an upstanding and conscientious corporate citizen, we have always sought to work in harmony with the various stakeholders. Therefore, we are appalled at the unwarranted and vicious attack that has been launched against the company and its Chairman by Prime Minister Gaston Browne and his government after plans to upgrade the resort in Antigua and Barbuda were revealed — news that should have been cause for celebration for any investor-savvy administration as it will be beneficial to both the country and the resort staff and their families.
When police arrived, the resident of the apartment met them at the front of the building and was placed in handcuffs, patted down for weapons and read his Miranda Rights, the report states.

But the Everblades took control of the game in the second, scoring twice to take a 2-0 advantage. First, defenseman Akim Aliu scored his second goal in as many games against the Rays on the power play at 12:04.
Patrick Gaul then tied the game at 2-2 with his sixth goal of the season at 11:03 of the final period with assists from Saucerman and defenseman Steve Weinstein. Saucerman took the initial shot from the right point, which bounced right to Gaul who buried the rebound.
Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme has issued a second apology to the photographer he kicked during the band's concert in Los Angeles on Saturday night.

A recent article by SportsNet columnist Mark Spector pointed out something very interesting about young defenceman Darnell Nurse that is worth noting. When asked what type of defenceman Nurse believes he could become in his wildest dreams, he answered the question with undoubtedly one of the best answers anyone could ever give to a question of that nature.
Spector also correctly points out that Nurse is developing at a pace that works for Darnell Nurse. A seventh-overall draft pick in 2013, it's taken Nurse a few seasons to really grow into his own. Perhaps fans of the Oilers had hoped he'd have impacted the game on a more significant level earlier in his career, but not all defensemen are Drew Doughty or Victor Hedman. Strong defenders often take time and Nurse needing a few seasons to get used to the speed of the NHL isn't terribly abnormal.
Some would suggest he's been the Oilers the best defenseman this season by a mile.
“In an ugly year for our hockey club he's having a pretty solid individual year,” said head coach Todd McLellan. “His game hasn't wavered much from night to night regardless of how the group is playing. He's an evolving young defenceman in our organization, obviously something we need. If we can keep his confidence level up we feel we have a good one.”
Nurse has done the same with his career. He wanted to be seen as a trusted defenseman who could play a well-rounded game. He wanted to be known as a teammate who would stand up for his players. He wanted to be counted on to produce offensively. He wanted his coaches to know he could play relatively mistake-free hockey. At every turn and with each objective, Nurse has taken things one step at a time.

An Indian newspaper reported on Monday that the scheme attracted less than 300 subscribers in four years. A social worker said both the previous and present governments did not make enough efforts to popularise the scheme. “It was the best scheme introduced by the Indian Government for the workers because government also contributed money for each worker joining the scheme,” K. V Shamsuddin, Chairman of Pravasi Bandhu Welfare Trust, a welfare organisation for expatriates, told Gulf News on Monday. He said the government had to make efforts to reach out to workers and educate them about the benefits of the scheme. “Unfortunately, it did not happen,” Shamsuddin said. An executive of a financial firm, which was entrusted with enrolling workers, said certain moves were already there in 2015 to discontinue the scheme. “One part of the scheme was withdrawn in 2015. Then it was not possible to market the scheme in that shape,” he said. Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Suraksha Yojana (MGPSY) MGPSY was attractive with Government's contribution in the scheme. For a minimum annual contribution of Rs5,000 (around Dh275) from a worker, the government was supposed to contribute Rs3,900 and Rs2,900 for female and male workers respectively. Indian Government offered to provide a contribution of up to Rs2,000 (Dh110) per year for male workers and Rs3,000 (Dh165) per year to women workers for up to either five years or until the worker returns home, whichever is earlier. The proposed contribution would flow to the individual account of each eligible subscriber. The workers have to contribute between Rs1,000 (Dh55) and Rs12,000 per annum towards pension fund and Rs4,000 towards return and resettlement fund. They would derive corresponding benefits when they go back home and during their old age Workers between the age of 18 and 50 who hold a Emigration Clearance Required (ECR) passports are eligible to enrol in the scheme.

The second occurred when Kirk Muller and defenseman Mathieu Schneider were traded to the New York Islanders for Pierre Turgeon and Vladimir Malakhov. It didn't work out. That year, the Habs missed the playoffs for the first time since 1970.
■ Trench war: Another game, another imposing front seven. After being overrun and allowing six sacks against the Vikings last week, the Lions' offensive linemen must do a better job winning their one-on-one battles to protect Matthew Stafford and allow passing plays to develop downfield. If not, it'll hamstring the passing attack and could lead to an ugly offensive showing against Carolina's fourth-ranked defense.

U.S. Congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) has become a formidable opponent in his extremely competitive race to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Senator Ted Cruz in November. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll that was conducted in mid-April, the Senate race shows O'Rourke trailing Cruz by only three percentage points, which is well within the margin of error. O'Rourke is also beating Cruz on the fundraising end, hauling in a reported $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
During its journey across six continents, the trophy will travel 126,000 kilometres in the months leading up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The global phase of the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kicked off in London, United Kingdom on January 22. The trophy will finish its world tour in Tokyo, Japan on April 30. In May 2018 the trophy will return to Russia for a final tour of the host country. The FIFA World Cup will run from June 14 to July 15, 2018. A proud football fan, former Pakistan cricket captain Younis Khan says he is “honoured” to be part of the delegation bringing the FIFA World Cup trophy to Pakistan on its world tour. Speaking to media in Chiang Mai, Thailand, from where the legendary batsman will accompany the trophy to Pakistan, Younis shared his excitement for the special occasion.
He said: “If voted to power, I will introduce system, which will enhance our domestic structure and our bowlers and batsmen can easily compete with any given team. There is no system exists in Pakistan, which can bring talent to mainstream. We will bring international teams to Pakistan and make Pakistan team a force to be reconned by producing quality fast bowlers. “We will continue to organise events like these in future too and ensure youth involved in healthy positive activities rather than wasting their talent,” he added.
Leader of the local affected people Mirza Ajmal Baig, a resident of village Gaggar Mughalaan, told the newsmen that there was a dire need of early establishment of the protective dyke along the banks of River Chenab. But instead of constructing the dyke, the 5.5km area has been left at the mercy of floods. The flood in River Chenab would wash out 31 villages of Sambrial tehsil completely and 71 other villages would partially be affected by the coming flood.
The news traveled fast in the Town on Tuesday, when the Bruins unveiled their opening night roster in the afternoon, and Grzelcyk was on it as a defenseman wearing #48.
Grzelcyk faced stiff competition during camp and pre-season this year, having spent the bulk of last year in Providence, and also competing against a new crop of budding Bruins stars. In the end, he won out over some very talented defensemen and hopes to continue on the roster for the rest of the year.

In their first series since 1951 to open with three overtimes — anyone heard of Bill Barilko? — the winner came from veteran Tyler Bozak on the power-play at 1:37. Standing in the slot, he redirected Nazem Kadri's feed from the left boards past Caps goalie Braden Holtby. Lars Eller was in the box, the second penalty drawn by rookie Zach Hyman, one of seven freshmen in the lineup Monday and three to get their first series point.
The letter was addressed to oversight panel Chairman Trey Gowdy, a Republican, and top Democrat Elijah Cummings.
During the second series of the game, Robinson batted down a pass on second down — a skill he exhibited a knack for as a rookie — and bullied guard Jack Mewhort on third down, driving the Colts offensive lineman deep into the pocket and forcing the quarterback to tuck the ball and scramble, resulting in a sack for teammate Alex Barrett.
Ngata, one of the best interior lineman of this era, had made a similar schematic switch during his career. And after a year mentoring Robinson, Ngata could see the results entering the youngster's second season.

Most significantly, Greene is African American, and comes along at a time when the sport's effort to retain a foothold in the black community has reached a crossroads: Despite a massive expenditure in money and manpower on the part of Major League Baseball, fewer than eight per cent of big leaguers are African-American, down from a peak of around 20 per cent in the 1980s. (Royce Lewis, the Orange County prep shortstop taken with the first overall pick by the Minnesota Twins, also has an African-American father.) As a Little Leaguer, Greene attended MLB's Urban Youth Academy in Compton, California — one of the initiatives the sport has introduced in recent years in an attempt to grow the game in African-American communities. When he was 13, he won an essay-writing contest, the prize for which was an audience with Jackie Robinson's daughter, Sharon. He clearly understands and embraces the responsibility that comes with having his stature and platform. “This is huge for our game,” commissioner Rob Manfred, who announced each pick from the MLB Network studios in Secaucus, New Jersey, told reporters. “We hope these programs will continue to produce players like Hunter.”
But Greene has a chance to be a baseball trailblazer in another way that has nothing to do with race. As a legitimate two-way prospect — a right-handed pitcher whose fastball has been clocked at 102 mph and a slugging shortstop with elite power — he is in position, under the right development plan, to blow away the baseball norms that hold that top prospects and impact big-leaguers are either pitchers or hitters, but never (or at least not since the days of Babe Ruth) both. (In this endeavour, he could be beaten to the history books. Louisville left-hander/first baseman Brendan McKay, another two-way star, is closer to being big-league-ready; he was taken fourth overall by Tampa Bay. Or perhaps by Shohei Otani, a legitimate two-way superstar known as “the Babe Ruth of Japan,” who is considering playing in America in the next two years.) When he was asked by reporters Monday night, following his selection by the Reds, whether he considers himself first and foremost a pitcher or a shortstop, Greene replied, “All of the above.” “On the mound, I consider myself a monster,” Greene told reporters, describing his different approaches to pitching and hitting. “I pound the zone. I get ahead. I stare guys in the eyes. I just like the whole competitive edge. At shortstop, showing my range and having smooth hands and footwork and firing across the diamond. Then hitting, just having good pitch selection and crushing balls, that's me. . . . “I still love doing both, and I think the ball club is excited for getting two players for one. So I think they're pretty pumped for that.” That may not be exactly true. While the Reds have said they will have an open mind to allowing Greene to continue pursuing his hitting career, they made it clear they drafted him as a pitcher. “Playing at the highest level is very difficult,” Reds general manager Dick Williams told reporters following the selection of Greene, “and I wouldn't want someone to focus on both to the detriment of one. We think Hunter's got a great chance to be a major-leaguer as a pitcher. We think the potential is there as a position player. I think at first we will focus on pitching, [but also] allow him to take at-bats. We'll keep the door open to playing in the field. This is a very unique situation, something we've never been confronted with before.” Greene hasn't pitched since April, so assuming he signs quickly — with a bonus expected to be in the high seven figures — and is able to begin his professional career in a developmental league this summer, he will be brought along slowly. And even if his development as a pitcher goes perfectly, it is likely to be years before we see Greene in the major leagues. Only five pitchers this century, most recently the Los Angeles Dodgers' Jose Urias last season, have appeared in a big league game as a teenager. But if and when he arrives, on a pitcher's mound or in a batter's box — or perhaps in both — Greene is likely to have an immediate impact on the sport, one that will rise in direct proportion to how well he performs on the field. Already, before his pro career has even begun, it is safe to say baseball has never seen a prospect like him.
It would be fiscally irresponsible to make a commitment to Halak, even if Oilers general manager Peter Chiarelli got creative and convinced Snow and the Islanders to take defenseman Mark Fayne.
The first segment accuses Congresswoman Maxine Waters and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice of “siding with a North Korean dictator.” Then, footage of Black men appears while Watters sets a segment about “guys with guns threatening President Trump over food stamps.” This may not come as a surprise, as Watters was once in hot water for an extremely racist segment that involved him walking around Chinatown and asking Asian people the most offensive and stereotypical questions, even for Fox News.

The show also re-enters the lives of the original film's main characters, not through the point of view of hero Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) but of his high school nemesis, Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). And much like a viral video from two years ago called “Daniel Is the REAL Bully,” Cobra Kai makes you sympathize with Johnny (now a struggling handyman) in the present day and rethink his character's entire past. Take, for instance, the fact that it was Daniel who moved in on his girlfriend (Elisabeth Shue) or that Johnny was being emotionally tormented by the wicked sensei Kreese (Martin Kove).
Imran Khan's PTI has, however, failed to name its candidate to replace Shah. The PTI made a loose alliance with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement to elect its own leader of the opposition but several smaller opposition parties refused to support the move.

A lot of the blame fell upon P.K. Subban, especially for his poor play on MacKinnon's incredible assist in Game 5. But this one mistake defined his image throughout the series. There seems to be an idea floating around that Subban is the third or even fourth best defenseman on the Predators, when in fact he's their best player. That applies to this series as well, Subban was great and the stats show it.
The Predators' defense had a weird start to the playoffs, as what was a strength last year took a while to get going this year. No goal was scored by a defenseman until Mattias Ekholm notched the winner in Game 6. From there, it felt like a weight was lifted off their back and almost everything went smoothly.
This is a coach's dream. Peter Laviolette gave his star some easier talent matchups and Subban made the Avalanche pay. Not only are the numbers above the average 50%, but all percentages are in elite territory. In fact, he is top five in all of these categories among defensemen who played over 100 minutes in the playoffs (I made the cut off at 100 minutes to weed out the third pairing defensemen). The only player he's second to on the Predators is Ekholm, who spent the majority of his minutes with Subban.
Defensemen Have to Defend
Playing with this edge has given the Predators an advantage. It takes the opposition off their game and draws penalties. In fact, Subban drew the most penalties of any Predators defenseman with three while only taking two minors, good for third least on the team. So no, he was not a liability but actually a net positive in terms of penalty minutes. Very few players can claim that, but those who do are often recognized for their skill.
Gone are the days of bone bruising shutdown defensemen like Chris Pronger and Scott Stevens and in their stead are smaller, more agile defenders like Subban. While he wasn't a physically dominating presence, he threw the second most hits of any one of the defense with 11. That's only two behind the leader, Emelin, who's known for his ability to hit.
If you love him for his on-ice play, you're justified. And if you hate him for crossing a line every once in a while, that's fine as well. But to think Subban's not as good as Roman Josi, Ryan Ellis, or Ekholm is wrong. The superstar defenseman has proved himself time and time again, and I will write as many articles as are needed to defend him and his play. I just hope that one day we can treasure him the way 30 other fanbases wish they could.

While thanking the chairman and his members for the farewell, the minister appreciated the efforts of the department in working to the best of their abilities and showing professionalism in achieving their targets and generating applaudable tax revenues. In her remarks, she also applauded PRA's achievements and valued the determinations of its officials in making it the success story of the Punjab government. She thanked PRA officials in good terms for all support they have been providing to the Finance Department and the Punjab government. She said it was their revenue collections and target achievements which have always helped the provincial government in planning and initiating new development projects. She stressed the need to introduce the culture of self-reliance and encouraged PRA officials to work with the same dedication for the betterment of the department, province and the nation. She said PRA has already collected RS.100 billion from its total target of Rs.115 billion before the close of this month while in 2013-14 the total tax collected stood at Rs 43 billion. She congratulated RA officials and chairman for the achievement. Chairman PRA thanked the minister for her kind words and support for the department as and when required.

He said Chairman CDA had approved 14 reforms of real estate sector that have not been implemented as yet due to which problems still persisted.
Offensive lineman Trey Hill, the No. 27-ranked prospect in the class of 2018, has decided to stay in his home state for college.
Bergevin has built a locker room in his own image, full of character and fun. And with his own confidence, the GM hasn't been afraid to surround himself with top-notch people in hockey operations. The biggest improvement in the Canadiens since Bergevin took over has been pro scouting, which has identified character players like goalie Mike Condon, defencemen Jeff Petry and Tom Gilbert, and forwards Dale Weise, Tomas Fleischmann, Brian Flynn, Torrey Mitchell and Alexander Semin (OK, nobody's perfect).
That is a rare Cowan quote that has not aged well. Only one of those “character” guys is still with the team. Last year, as the Canadiens were gearing up for the playoffs, they acquired Dwight King, Andreas Martinsen, and Steve Ott. Character guys. The problem is that none of these players are still playing in the NHL. Oh well. If Bergevin starts focusing on skill, he will be out. I, for one, can't wait for a few more depth defenseman and bottom-nine wingers. Y'know, character guys.
The External Affairs Ministry said India remains committed to address on "priority" with Pakistan the humanitarian matters, including those pertaining to prisoners and fishermen in each other's country.

But workers at a casino Starbucks that the couple frequented say Paddock often scolded his girlfriend in public. Others who crossed paths with Paddock in recent months described him as despondent.
When Paddock visited B&S Guns in Garland, Texas, last year he asked about ways to modify a gun to make it easier to pull the trigger, owner Paul Peddle said. Danley, who was walking with a cane at the time, played with Peddle's puppies while her boyfriend asked questions. And when it was time to go, Paddock walked helped her into the car.
Newry & Armagh Assemblyman William Irwin described the report as “deeply concerning”.
Whether the Senators trade Karlsson is almost two different questions, depending entirely on Karlsson's aspirations. If it seems like he's most interested in greener pastures than being a career Senators, then Ottawa has to entertain the idea. If he wants to remain in Ottawa, and the question is whether they should flip one of the best defensemen in NHL history before he's 30 in exchange for rebuilding blocks, then the answer is a resounding "no."
Karlsson is part of the solution, not the problem. He's a foundational pillar for a rebuild; and frankly, the timetables for rebuilds in the NHL are so unpredictable he could still be in his prime when they circle back to contention. He's a defenseman who has several years of elite play left in him. He's a franchise player for whom there will never be equal value returning to Ottawa; and please recall that a player of Karlsson's stature and financial wants has a limited trade market, because max value hinges on him signing there.
Power Rankings: Players who are victims of Olympics gamesmanship Olympic hockey is on everyone's mind this week, given the news about the IOC banning Russia from the 2018 Winter Games.

To witness Les Deuxluxes' blazing live show is to experience love at first sight, but Les Deuxluxes themselves are — as brassy frontwoman and guitarist Anna Frances Meyer puts it — “a love story.” That's right. The unendingly adorable, always immaculately attired Montréalais blues-rock duo is also a couple. And Meyer and guitarist/drummer Étienne Barry might have left it at that were it not for the fortunate intervention of the Quebec student strike of 2012, which left Barry — then studying classical piano at McGill University, from whence Meyer also recently graduated with a degree in classical music and opera — with six months off school in a weird limbo where he couldn't really commit to a job because classes could start up again at any time. The pair decided busking would be an easy way to make some quick cash. Meyer grabbed her ukulele; Barry a guitar, and on a lark they headed into the metro tunnels armed with “the fastest songs we could put together.” Although decidedly more “unplugged” than the fuzzed-out electric Deuxluxes performances of today, the band's go-for-the-throat attitude toward the stage was there from the beginning, even if the “stage” for the first year was a variety of subway stops about Montreal. It wasn't quite as easy a way to make money as they'd hoped, mind you. “For it to be livable to be a busker you've gotta do, like, eight hours a day. You've gotta do it like a real job,” says Meyer. “But we'd get tired in an hour because we just gave too much energy. We were giving the same show that we give now in the metro, acoustic and screaming. So that was bad.”
Singer Wayne Coyne is very much the frontman – but the band – keyboard and/or guitarists Steven Drozd, Derek Brown and Jake Ingallis; bassist Michael Ivins, and drummers Matt Duckworth and Nick Ley – are a formidable ensemble, powerful and at times orchestral, and at times they over power Coyne's rather frail voice, perhaps due to a pretty bad sound mix.
Saladino jammed his ankle into second base as he took a throw from second baseman Hernan Perez on a force play in the third inning Tuesday night. Saladino had to be helped off the field.
There was only one notable decline, and that was the doozy at “Kinky Boots” ($805,897), off 52% following the departure of Brendon Urie, the frontman of band Panic! at the Disco.

There is a history of brinksmanship in resolving bilateral stand-offs between the two countries due to a lack of conflict resolution mechanisms in the two treaties. In 1958 Egypt laid claim to two territories in the Halayeb region. Khalil sent troops to the disputed territory. Developments then, echoed by current events, suggested an imminent military clash along the common border – but Egypt reconsidered its position. Just as the situation unfolded recently, Sudan urged the UN Security Council and Egypt to let the crisis die away, making it appear as if it had abandoned its claim over Halayeb.

PARIS - Marin Cilic may have won the 2014 US Open but the giant Croatian said Tuesday that winning a Grand Slam pales into significance when compared to his recent wedding day. The affable 29-year-old married longtime girlfriend Kristina Milovic, an interior designer, in Dubrovnik four weeks ago and he insisted nothing can top that day. "We had a wonderful day with family and friends. Kristina and I have been together for a long time and to find someone like her is very special," said Cilic. "It's very different to being on a tennis court." Third seed Cilic was speaking after reaching the French Open second round on Tuesday with a 6-3, 7-5, 7-6 (7/4) win over Australia's James Duckworth. Cilic, the Wimbledon and Australian Open runner-up, will face Polish qualifier Hubert Hurkacz next. AFP
Brendan Smith, who looked like a solid second-pair defenseman last year, played so horribly this season, that he's now riding buses in the AHL Ondřej Pavelec came in to back up Henrik Lundqvist, but he injured his knee a few weeks back, and with the ascension of Alexandar Georgiev, it's doubtful he'll suit up for the team again.
"Having every little aspect of your life in the public eye, it's really hard, because it gives more room for criticism, and I just want to live. So I think I try and stay out of it as much as possible, unless I need to be in it. I don't really go anywhere to be seen or anything like that. I'll go to a red carpet, if I'm in [the movie], or if I'm supporting my boyfriend or my friends. But otherwise I usually just stay home."

To attack with two great fast bowlers in the most aggressive manner with fields set to put fear in the eyes of the opposing batsmen was something that Pakistan teams put into practice time and time again. It may appear strange in today's world where statistics are over-analysed but the mantra of bowling as fast as you can without worrying about such things as extras or being hit for the occasional boundary was the order of the day in the old days under Imran.
The tentative approach of the first game was replaced with an all-out attack by the bowlers in the do-or-die games against South Africa and Sri Lanka. The bowlers attacked the stumps and the batsmen in a manner which would have made the likes of Imran, Wasim, Waqar and Mushtaq proud of their successors. Mohammad Amir bowled with pace and accuracy and the yorkers from each of Junaid Khan and Hasan Ali were fired in with intent to take wickets. When Shadab Khan was asked to take his place in the team for the semi-final clash with England, he responded with a bowling performance which was not meant to save runs but took out arguably the best batsman England had on offer.

Rohit Sharma has been named as India's vice-captain. ​BCCI announced India's 15 member squad for the upcoming ODI and T20 series against Sri Lanka on 13th August. The series includes five ODI matches and one T20 game.The selectors have made major changes in the ODI line-up and have picked the team eyeing the 2019 World Cup.The squad features some high profile omissions and also has some interesting selections. We look at the top five takeaways India's ODI selectionIn Virat Kohli, India have found a long-term leader. Considering Kohli's staggering consistency, he is sure to lead India for an extended duration. The issue India are facing is of the vice-captain of the team who will handle the reins of the team during Kohli's absence.In the past, the selectors choose Ajinkya Rahane for this job, but currently, the Mumbai batsman's place in the team is in question and hence he isn't the ideal candidate for the post of vice-captain.By naming Rohit Sharma as the vice-captain, the selectors have settled this issue. The right-hand batsman has led Mumbai Indians pretty well in the IPL and his batting at the top of the order in the last couple of years has been consistent.This also makes it clear that Rohit's place in the ODI team is secure and he will directly walk into the playing XI after being out of action for some months due to injuries.​
While the Devils defense has been porous, to say the least (we'll get to that below), Damon Severson has given the offense some jump. The former Kelowna Rockets defenseman leads New Jersey's blueliners with 18 points and is sixth on the club in scoring overall. Severson is four points removed from surpassing his 2015-16 total of 21.
After dropping seven straight, New Jersey decided to mix it up both literally and figuratively. Adding defenseman Seth Helgeson from AHL Albany and enforcer Luke Gazdic, the Devils threw off the gloves and threw their weight around. The Devils racked up 30 penalty minute against the rival Philadelphia Flyers. More helpful though were the four tallies and a shutout performance by Cory Schneider in a 4-0 victory.

The wind cooled warm nights and heated arguments in the vacant basketball court, but brought with it the cruel suggestion of rain. Games ran long into the nights, powered by malfunctioning lights and intense competition. The crack of a tennis ball leaving low-quality willow is unmistakable, the dangerous sign of a batsman hitting ripe form.
Nobody was safe in the confines of the court– from flying balls or thinly veiled sledging. Excuses are made to parents and girlfriends to stay that one game longer, to live in fantasy that one hour more.
The left-handed batsman went on to hit 17 fours in his 123-ball knock before he was out for 119, hitting a sweep shot off left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara straight to Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal at square leg.
The 26-year-old, replacing the injured Rangana Herath, also removed the dangerous Kohli with the right-handed batsman out for 42 after getting an edge to slip.
The hosts have been hurt by injuries throughout the series and will be missing both spin spearhead Herath and paceman Nuwan Pradeep. Middle-order batsman Dhananjaya de Silva was dropped after scores of nought and 17 in Colombo.

Trout led off the third with a single and stole second when Calhoun struck out looking on a 3-and-2 fastball. C.J. Cron reached on catcher's interference, Andrelton Simmons replaced him on a fielder's choice groundout, and Jefry Marte lined out to third to end the inning.In the fifth, Trout worked a one-out walk, and Astros third baseman Marwin Gonzalez flubbed Calhoun's potential double-play ball. That put two men on for Cron, who, again, flied out to center.
Chavez permitted another run in the third on two singles and a sacrifice fly. He withstood further Astros' attacks for four more innings to turn in his second solid start in three tries. In relief, right-hander Yusmeiro Petit allowed a run on back-to-back doubles. Second baseman Danny Espinosa threw out Jose Altuve, the latter doubler, to aid the Angels' attempts to escape the inning.
In today's rumor rundown the Carolina Hurricanes just made a trade for one of their defensemen almost a guarantee with the signing of Calvin de Haan on Tuesday. Who will it be? Also, it looks like there is a frontrunner for Erik Karlsson's services and a surprise team might be leading the charge. The Rangers have a decision to make on Kevin Hayes and
After landing top-four defenseman Calvin de Haan in free agency, the Carolina Hurricanes must have something else coming. Of the many teams that needed another defenseman, Carolina really wasn't one of them so the expectation is that with Dougie Hamilton, Justin Faulk, Jaccob Slavin, Brett Pesce, Trevor van Riemsdyk (an RFA), young pros Haydn Fleury and Roland McKeown, and elite prospects Jake Bean, Luke Martin, and Adam Fox all on the roster, someone is moving. Logic would suggest that someone is Justin Faulk.
Luke DeCock suggests the Hurricanes now have their top four defensemen signed for the next three seasons at $19.3 million per season and Faulk isn't in that group.
Shapiro believes that any deal for Karlsson would have to include young defenseman Julius Honka, while Ottawa may be asking about Esa Lindell. But, that wouldn't be all. More names like Miro Heiskanen, Radek Faksa, Devin Shore, Valeri Nichushkin, and Riley Tufte, or a combination of these players could be part of the deal as well.

Karachi [Pakistan], Aug 14 (ANI): Pakistan's out-of favour batsman Shan Masood has insisted that he is currently focussing on performing well in the domestic circuit to grab the national selectors' attention ahead of the Test series against Sri Lanka in the UAE later this year.
The 27-year-old made his last Test appearance for Pakistan during his side's 2-1 win over West Indies in the three-match series -- the farewell series for former captain Misbah-ul-Haq and veteran batsman Younis Khan.
Keeping the same in mind, Shan believes playing on foreign pitches becomes much easier for a batsman if he applies himself effectively.
"For a batsman, international conditions are much easier.It is harder to be a batsman in domestic cricket. If you perform in these [domestic] conditions, all you have to do is take the pressure of international cricket and apply yourself effectively," said Shan.
During the show, frontman Brandon Flowers also made an implicit comment about another of the weekend's stories. During the previous night of the KROQ Christmas show, Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Josh Homme kicked photographer Chelsea Lauren in the face. While the Killers were playing, Flowers pulled Killers photographer Rob Loud out of the photo pit and onto the stage, telling him, “I'm not gonna kick you in the face. Just come on up here. I just want to tell you to tell all your friends that you're welcome here, and that any Killers concert, you're safe and you're respected.” He then dedicated a song to the photographers at the show, saying, “They make us look good. We need to take care of these people.” Here's the video:

Sean Tubby: Pakistan was the easiest border crossing we have had. In fact, it took longer to leave Iran than enter Pakistan. A well spoken gentleman walked us through the procedure, while border staff and money changers came to stare at us with interested and slightly bewildered expressions. We were then sent up the road through a set of huge and ornate gates that were promptly opened ajar to let our bikes through. Half a dozen smartly dressed soldiers with neatly trimmed beards sat us down at a garden table with easy smiles. They then took our details and were amused and confused in equal measure about the fact that our passports had the words Northern Ireland printed on the front.

They will acquire a second baseman this offseason.

RAWALPINDI Oct 06 (APP): Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff
Kim Jong-nam was estranged from his younger brother, the North Korean leader. He had been tipped by outsiders to succeed their dictator father, but reportedly fell out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He was believed to have been living recently in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia.Multiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said Kim Jong-nam was killed at the airport by two women believed to be North Korean agents. They fled in a taxi and were being sought by Malaysian police, the reports said.A Malaysian police statement confirmed the death of a 46-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang on June 10, 1970. “Investigation is in progress and a post mortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,” the statement said.Ken Gause, at the CNA think tank in Washington who has studied North Korea's leadership for 30 years, said Kim Chol was a name that Kim Jong-nam has traveled under. He is believed to have been born May 10, 1971, although birthdays are always unclear for senior North Koreans, Gause said.Mark Tokola, vice president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in Seoul, said it would be surprising if Kim Jong-nam was not killed on the orders of his brother, given that North Korean agents have reportedly tried to assassinate Kim Jong-nam in the past.“It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un,” Tokola wrote in a commentary Tuesday. Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong-nam was plotting against the North Korean leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who would want to depose his brother.In Washington, the State Department said it was aware of reports of Kim Jong-nam's death but declined to comment, referring questions to Malaysian authorities.The reported killing came as North Korea celebrated its latest missile launch, which foreign experts were analyzing for evidence of advancement in the country's missile capabilities. For the next several days, North Korea will be marking the birthday of its late leader Kim Jong-il, the brothers' father, though they have different mothers. The major holiday this Thursday is called the “Day of the Shining Star” and will be feted with figure skating and synchronized swimming exhibitions, fireworks and mass rallies.Since taking power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has executed or purged a slew of high-level government officials in what the South Korean government has described as a “reign of terror.” The most spectacular was the 2013 execution by anti-aircraft fire of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, once considered the country's second-most-powerful man, for what the North alleged was treason.Gause said Kim Jong-nam had been forthright that he did not have political ambitions, although he was publicly critical of the North Korean regime and his brother's legitimacy in the past.Kim Jong-nam had been less outspoken since 2011, when North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot him in Macau, Gause said, though the details of the attempted killing are murky. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organize a hit-and-run accident targeting Kim Jong-nam in China in 2010.Despite the attempts on his life, Kim Jong-nam had reportedly traveled to North Korea since then, so it was assumed he was no longer under threat. Kim Jong-nam may have become more vulnerable as his defender in the North Korean hierarchy, Kim Kyong Hui _ Kim Jong-un's aunt and the husband of his executed uncle, Jang Song-thaek _ appears to have fallen from favor or died. She has not been seen in public for more than three years, Gause said.Kim Jong-il had at least three sons with two women, as well as a daughter by a third. Kim Jong-nam was the eldest, followed by Kim Jong-chul, who is a few years older than Kim Jong-un and is known as a playboy who reportedly attended Eric Clapton concerts in London in 2015. It's unclear what positon he has in the North Korean government. A younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, was named a member of the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee during a North Korean party congress last May. She has a position in a propaganda and agitation department and is known as Kim Jong-un's gatekeeper, Gause said.While the most likely explanation for the killing was that Kim Jong-un was removing a potential challenger to North Korean leadership within his own family, he could also be sending a warning to North Korean officials to demonstrate the reach of the regime. It follows the defection last year of a senior diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in London who has spoken of his despair at Kim's purges.Evans Revere, a former US diplomat and specialist on East Asia, said the killing did not mean the North Korean regime was unstable. He said it showed Kim Jong-un's brutal control and ability to eliminate opponents or perceived opponents.Victor Cha, a former White House director for Asian affairs, disagreed.“He sacks the minister of state security last month and now kills the elder brother. Doesn't look so stable to me,” Cha said. (AP)

Former Prime Minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) stalwart Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is all set to challenge Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan from NA-53, Islamabad in the general elections taking place on July 25, 2018. For this purpose the former premiere has already launched his campaign. Imran Khan, too set off his election campaign from the Convention Center Islamabad with an electrifying address to his workers and supporters on Saturday, June 30. Khan is hopeful to make a clean sweep from this constituency, however, as the candidates are changed in this constituency so have the circumstances and this time voters are not going to blindly vote for either of the two. Pakistan Observer in an interaction with a large number of voters from this constituency, came to know about the grievances of voters against the two major political parties—PML-N and PTI—and their candidates. PTI's candidate Asad Umar from NA-54 and Imran Khan from NA-53 are largely seen as ‘outsiders'.

"The Holder report could have been written by a law student who took an introductory corporate governance course," said Erik Gordon, a technology and entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. "The board shares responsibility for the wreck."Uber retained Holder's firm in February after a female former employee publicly accused the company of brazen sexual harassment. A wake of scandals followed, including a criminal investigation of the company's use of technology to evade regulators, a lawsuit alleging stolen self-driving car technology and a string of allegations relating to a toxic culture.On Tuesday, David Bonderman, a founder of private equity firm TPG Capital, an Uber investor, resigned from the board after making a sexist comment about women talking too much at the Uber staff meeting convened to discuss the Holder report.The resignation leaves Uber's board with seven voting members and four vacant seats. Unlike the boards of most big companies, Uber's directors have little executive experience. In addition to Kalanick, the board includes co-founder and Chairman Garrett Camp, early employee Ryan Graves, venture capitalist Bill Gurley, Saudi investor Yasir al-Rumayyan and media impresaria Arianna Huffington.

The PCB's tribunal has already banned Pakistani batsmen Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif for five years each in the same case, although the former has been given a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence.
Vice captain David Warner was also banned for 12 months and batsman Cameron Bancroft suspended for nine months, as Australia were criticised globally by fans and commentators for what they perceived to be an arrogant and hypocritical team culture.
One of the leading batsmen in the world, the 28-year-old Australian has also been barred from holding leadership positions in the national side for two years.
Reminiscing about the Sharjah innings, the legendary batsman said that Australia were "virtually unbeatable" at that time, but said that he had prepared well, and was ready for the challenge. He remembered his practice on turning tracks against the likes of L Sivaramakrishnan, Nilesh Kulkarni, Rajesh Pawar and Sairaj Bahutule, so that he could face Shane Warne better.

India handed Sri Lanka a 3-0 whitewash. ​​India beat Sri Lanka in the third and final Test of the 3-match series by an innings and 171 runs with more than two days to spare. The number one Test team registered their first whitewash away from home in Tests (minimum of 3-Test series).The hosts continued their sorry performance with the bat on day 3. Continuing from their overnight score of 19 for 1, they lost Dimuth Karunaratne very early in the day.Mohammed Shami, who bowled a brilliant spell with the new ball in the first innings, was at his best yet again. He dismissed Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis cheaply and put Sri Lanka under pressure straight away.After losing four wickets for not much on the board, the two best batsmen of Sri Lanka - Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, put together a patient partnership of 65 runs. However, both batsmen got out in quick succession looking to play attacking shots.Niroshan Dickwella (41 off 52 balls) impressed once again with his composure at the crease. The attacking southpaw looked the best of the lot during his stay. He employed the sweep against the spinners and kept the scoreboard ticking but it wasn't enough to impact the game. For India, it was Shami who was the pick of the bowlers once again. The quickie started the day brilliantly, getting two quick wickets upfront and setting the tone for the spinners. Ravichandran Ashwin, too, was brilliant with his off-spinners and picked up four wickets for 68. Kuldeep Yadav and Umesh Yadav bagged one and two wickets respectively.With this dominating win, India handed Sri Lanka their first whitewash in a 3-Test series since 2004.Here are five talking points from the day's play.India dominated the hosts in all departments of the game. They bowled, batted and fielded in a superior fashion in all the games and even had a better success rate using DRS.But the main reason Sri Lanka lost this series 3-0 was their uninspiring batting. The hosts just couldn't perform as a team the entire series.It was the same story on day 3 as all the batsmen lacked intent and threw away their wickets. Things are not looking good for the future of Sri Lankan cricket at the moment.​
In the past, he was used as a middle-order batsman too until MS Dhoni pointed out that Rahane's lack of strike-rotation affects India's middle-overs. Dhoni might have been right. Rahane does get a tad stuck at the crease, bides his time to get into groove and then plays freely. These are a quality best suited for opening batsmen. But India does not have a vacancy there with Rohit and Dhawan sealing their spots with scintillating performances.
"I think we made it clear in Sri Lanka that he is an opening batsman and we don't want to keep changing his batting slot. It plays on anyone's mind not just his, if one's batting order is kept on changing”, Rohit had said.
In a way, Rohit is right. Rahane's best has always come as an opening batsman. But in conditions where the ball swings around, shouldn't Rahane, India's most equipped batsman technically, be in the playing XI, as opener or not?

The group started to make good on that promise with the simmering “B Lover,” and now they're back with another new one called “After Falling Asleep.” Compared to its predecessors, “After Falling Asleep” takes place in a more amorphous zone, with elements that recall shoegaze and dream-pop. It also departs from Say Sue Me's work otherwise due to the fact that frontwoman Sumi Choi sings in Korean this time around.

Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained ISIS-linked terrorists who were planning attacks on the Moscow public transport system and other crowded places in Moscow.Following the analysis of the materials found in the detainees' house outside Moscow, the FSB said that it was a dangerous peroxide-based explosive, also known as the 'Mother of Satan.' T"We have taken samples. According to these samples it is triacetone triperoxide (TATP), a very dangerous initiate explosive,"a serviceman is heard saying in a video taken during the FSB operation.The video features materials to produce a bomb stored in the house, as well as several grenades found in the basement and Kalashnikov assault rifles.The FSB says it has suppressed "a terrorist group which was plotting to commit a series of terrorist attacks in places of mass gatherings, including those on transport and major shopping venues in Moscow." The statement adds that the group was going to use "suicide bombers and high-powered explosive devices."Two suicide bombers, an explosives production specialist, as well as an Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) emissary who masterminded the planned attacks were detained during a special operation in Moscow Region on Monday.The FSB also discovered and neutralized an explosives production laboratory.The security agency also said that there was one Russian citizen and three citizens of Central Asian states among the detainees. Their names have not been disclosed so far.In late May, the FSB detained four ISIS-linked terrorists who were also preparing to carry out attacks in the Russian capital. The terrorists also planned to go to Syria and fight alongside ISIS militants.Earlier in May, a suspected Islamic State recruiter was arrested Russia's mainly-Muslim Republic of Bashkortostan.Apart from fighting terrorist infiltrators at home, Russia has been assisting Syrian government forces against Islamic State and other terrorist groups in Syria since September 2015.

Chandimal was the only batsman to provide some resistance with a dogged 48 but became one of spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's two wickets.
Kuldeep showed he was a more than capable lower-order batsman with a well-crafted 26, more importantly adding 62 in an eighth-wicket stand that dampened Sri Lanka's hopes of restricting the touring side to under 400.

A few recent events contribute to this quandary. In the immediate past was the political gamesmanship we witnessed in Kashmir, where, to placate the misplaced sentiments of the chief minister, an FIR was lodged against the aggrieved party: The army personnel. They were the victims, as they were attacked by a mob that resorted to carnage, resulting in the dastardly act of burning of military vehicles and threatening the personal security of the soldiers.

The going hasn't been easy for either batsman in this tour. Kohli, for all his credentials as the best across formats among the current lot, had been under a lot of flak for his failures with the bat in the first two Tests, with his critics using terms such as 'flat-track bully' and adjectives such as 'overrated' quite freely.
If his gritty 48 in the second innings of the Wanderers Test — at a time when the pitch was at its deadliest — was anything to go by, it was that the Mumbai batsman had finally found his rhythm after a lean patch back home. His 79 in his latest outing at Durban was a hallmark of his patience as well as his intent at the crease. Rahane perhaps wanted to send out a message very clearly to the team think tank — that he was of worth in the Indian middle-order in coloured clothing as well, and that he shouldn't be treated as a reserve opener alone.

I had hoped that a childhood filled with nuclear fear, and duck and cover drills was long over. Later, in the early 1980s, Gorbachev was my man, glasnost, perestroika; he ended the Cold War with great gestures of sanity. Boy that felt like a relief! Now it seems our fate is in the hands of two narcissistic, egotistical, insane madmen threatening nuclear war, one of whom happens to be the president of the United States. A nuclear checklist is in order.
Make or buy fire starters. Home-made fire starters: get cardboard egg cartons and fill them with drier lint. Double boil blocks of paraffin wax in a # 10 can and soak the eggs carton spaces with melted wax; let dry. You only need @ 1/8 of one of these egg carton units to start dry wood, so, for example, three or four egg cartons worth of fire starters can last a good while. Only use fire for heat and functional stuff, not recreation. One home-made egg carton unit fire starter can start wet driftwood. This is good stuff. Cavemen would not believe it.

Meanwhile, Roketsan Chairman M. Emin Alpman said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stressed permanent nationality and locality in the defense industry.
"We are a group that has been producing for the defense industry since the 1980s. A strong Turkey is the collateral of the regional countries. Now there is great will for the national and domestic defense industry. We can take action backed by this will," Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ICI) General Assembly Chairman and Kale Group Chairman Zeynep Bodur Okyay said. "Let us not forget this sector is shaped by the state. At the beginning of the 2000s, we were the sixth most importing country in the defense industry. We fell to 11th place thanks to the locality project we carried out in the past. This is an important indicator."
TBMM Industry, Trade, Energy, Natural Resources, Information and Technology Commission Chairman Ziya Altunyaldız underlined that Turkey has experienced a significant paradigm shift in the past 15 years.

Having earlier accused Congress of using impeachment notice against the CJI as a political tool, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday blamed eminent lawyers who are also part of political parties of dragging "intra court disputes into the parliamentary process".In a long Facebook post, second in four days, Jaitley said business persons and industrialists have frequently been accused of attempting to influence policy by using parliamentary processes. But now lawyer politicians were using the same methods."Most political parties have given nominations to some of them since their value, both in court and Parliamentary debates, is significant. The incidental impact of this has been a growing tendency of lawyer Members to drag intra court disputes into the parliamentary process. The misconceived motion for the impeachment of the Chief Justice of India is just one example of this," wrote Jaitley in his post.On Saturday, Opposition MPs handed over the impeachment motion to Vice Chairman of Rajya Sabha Venkaiah Naidu. The notice was moved "on five grounds of misbehaviour".The notice was subsequently shot down by Naidu claiming that the Opposition MPs were "unsure" of their own case and that their notice was based on "suspicion and conjectures".In his post titled 'Why the Malafide Impeachment Motion was bound to fail?' Jaitley detailed how it was wrong at so many levels.Jaitley said the notice was filed on untenable grounds and with the "purpose to intimidate the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the highest judiciary"."The Congress Party is capable of dragging the judges into an unsavoury controversy and make them controversial, should their judicial opinion not appear favourable in the cases in which the Party has an interest...The Congress Party knew this. It's object was not the passage of the Motion but intimidation of India's judiciary," said Jaitley.Jaitley also said the impeachment notice was "poorly drafted" and it failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the said judge was guilty.Much like Congress's five counts of misbehaviour against Justice Misra, Jaitley too came up with five reasons why the petition was malafide and improper.Jaitley termed Congress's decision to file a petition in the Supreme Court a "blunder"."For the Congress Party to carry forward its mistake of subjecting legislative processes to judicial review would be a blunder. The Parliament is supreme in its own jurisdiction. Its process cannot be subjected to judicial review," said Jaitley.Read Jaitley's complete Facebook post here:

Selectmen focused on two pending projects during their Monday night meeting.
They named the contractors for the first phases of the expansion of the transfer station. The contract for the excavation/earthworks portion of the project goes to Skip Eaton.

The other selectmen agreed. Eaton's bid was $40,453.

There was decidedly less enthusiasm for the brio mustered by former Democratic Chairman John Burton, who flipped President Trump the double-bird at a recent state party convention and led a crowd chant of the f-bomb.
"Erdoğan is a political actor that is well connected with the voters and is able to project their choices. This is what has given him leverage and confidence against his rivals," İbrahim Uslu, the president of ANAR Research Company, says. Erdoğan announced the June 24 snap parliamentary and presidential elections last week, following the call by MHP Chairman Devlet Bahçeli to hold elections ahead of schedule, initially planned for November 2019. The opposition had interpreted the move as a problem for the government, indicating that the government's popularity was in decline. Uslu says, however, that Erdoğan is a "rational politician" that respects intraparty mechanisms in decision-making processes, rather than reaching conclusions right away.
Meanwhile, THE confusion among the opposition becomes clearer every passing day. The CHP Chairman Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu remains adamant about not putting himself forward as a presidential candidate while blocking other party members from doing so. The secret negotiations with the far-right İP culminated in the CHP just handing over 15 deputies over the weekend to allow the İP to create a 20-strong parliamentary group. It allowed İP Chairwoman Meral Akşener the opportunity to run for president.

Can you suggest any alternative brands that would be an excellent choice? He's not much of a Rolex/Tag man, he's an action adventure kinda guy. I am looking at around 5000 Euro / $5800 budget.

Meanwhile, of the five men we have noted as committing to Arizona as incoming freshmen this year, only one of them is really a sprinter, so Busch is really going to have to dig deep to find the pieces to rebuild the sprint relays that are such a a big part of scoring at NCAAs.
Despite the summer's uncertainty in the coaching situation, the Cavaliers were not hit with same wave of transfers as Arizona. Additionally, while the Cavs' relays may not have done great at NCAAs, they were largely manned by freshmen and sophomores, meaning that DeSorbo will not be starting from zero. That, coupled with a diverse incoming freshman class of at least nine men, plus the buzz that DeSorbo has generated over the past few years with NC State, means that Virginia should be able to restock relatively quickly.
Obviously, there is no way of knowing for sure which of these three programs will be the first back into the top ten at NCAAs, but all appear to have the coaching staff, the history, the facilities, and the resources to be back among the elite programs in the country sooner rather than later. It feels like DeSorbo's success at NC State makes the Virginia men the “hot” pick, but given that the Arizona women had the best NCAA finish this past year, have a relatively strong group of freshmen coming in, and Busch's proven track record of working with women, they're the safer bet for ow.

Sony Pictures has released a first full trailer for Spider-Man spin-off Venom."You should be extremely afraid," says Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, a reporter who "follows people that do not want to be followed." After a mysterious teaser emerged in February, Sony Pictures has now commenced distribution of a more fleshed-out look at October anti-hero movie Venom.As a thorn in the side of biotechnologist Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) Brock finds himself poking around an experimental program that harnesses an aggressive, churning life form known as a symbiote.Here we see more of his powers as unwilling host of an alien villain and eventual Spider-Man antagonist.Directed by Ruben Fleischer of Zombieland and Gangster Squad, Venom is heading towards a release date of October 5, 2018 in US theaters with international rollout commencing the same week.Michelle Williams of Manchester by the Sea, Brokeback Mountain, The Greatest Showman and I Feel Pretty co-stars as Brock's lawyer girlfriend Ann Weying.Tom Hardy is well-known for magnetic performances in films such as Bronson, Inception, Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises, Mad Max: Fury Road, Legend and The Revenant.

It's not that surprising that Disney and Lucasfilm are campaigning to get some awards love for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The franchise is no stranger to awards, but it's garnered more love in technical categories from the Academy over the years. Is Mark Hamill's performance in the movie really that good?

Financial services conglomerate HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has said succession planning at the housing finance firm and its group companies is a "key agenda" before their boards and they need to evaluate options of both external and internal candidates.Parekh, however, made it clear that at HDFC Ltd, the board and its present Vice Chairman and CEO Keki Mistry have agreed that he will continue in this role for a period of three years, subject to shareholders' approval.In his annual letter to investors, Parekh said it is important to reiterate to all the shareholders that succession planning both, within HDFC and its group companies is a key agenda on each of the respective boards."As passionate and energetic as some of our leaders within the HDFC group are about their jobs, the reality is that individuals do get on in age."Personally, the task of ensuring frictionless transitions is and will be on the top of my mind. That said, it is not as if there will be any announcements right away. All the boards of the HDFC group of companies believe that succession planning needs a time frame of 18 to 24 months to ensure a smooth transition," he said.Parekh said he is confident of the strong pipeline of talent for various functions across all companies within the HDFC group."Yet, positions at the helm require the respective boards and nomination and remuneration committees to evaluate options of both, internal and external candidates," he wrote.Parekh said he could not be more grateful to all the leaders across the HDFC group for the extraordinary work that they do each day."Yet, each one of these outstanding leaders stand tall because of their strong and cohesive teams that back them. As for me, I won't lose sight of the fact that it is the continued support of our shareholders that gives me the privilege to serve as non-executive chairman," he said.Besides HDFC Ltd, the major group firms include HDFC Bank, currently headed by Aditya Puri, as well as its mutual fund and insurance ventures.The bank has also decided to look for the successor for its managing director Aditya Puri. The successor is likely to be announced by October 2019, a year prior to Puri stepping down from the charge in October 2020.Parekh said HDFC has delivered amongst the best-in-class shareholder value - an estimated 360 times increase in market capitalisation over a 25-year period between 1993 and 2018.There are now four listed entities within the HDFC group and one more is on the anvil."We hope to have the initial public offering of HDFC Asset Management Company Limited launched shortly," Parekh said.He said HDFC concluded the last financial year with an equity share capital raise of Rs 13,000 crore and a large part of the capital raised will be utilised to maintain its shareholding in HDFC Bank."Our investment in the bank has been amongst our best value drivers for several years," he said.Parekh said HDFC continues to maintain a fortified balance sheet and the time is right to lay the foundation for the next phase of long-term growth and sustainability."Some of our plans for the future are still at the drawing board stage. Yet, we know the broad contours."We want to focus on strengthening our presence across the entire value chain of housing, seek opportunities in stressed real estate assets, mark a deeper footprint in the health insurance space and explore emerging organic and inorganic growth opportunities," he said.Parekh said the group will also continue to support the growth of our subsidiary companies.He said as a financial conglomerate, HDFC needs to keep building for the future."Our key long-term priorities are ethics, transparency, performance and customer-orientation. We will continue to pursue these priorities with vigour whilst focusing on the potential to create long-term value," Parekh wrote.He said the group regularly engages in dialogue with our stakeholders on developments of the Corporation, but desists from the practice of quarterly or annual earnings guidance."Listed companies do feel the pressure - not of quarterly reporting per se, but meeting short-term expectations of the markets in an increasingly volatile environment."Globally, there is a discernible trend of companies curtailing capex, holding back on investing in new products or reducing budgets on human resources, research and development. These are often myopically construed as dispensable costs. Nothing can be more damaging to a company than putting off long-term investments to appease short-term stakeholders.

Decisions taken by Kohli in the Test against Bangladesh looked critical in the beginning. At first glance, even I questioned the dropping of Karun Nair despite his brilliant triple century and the selection of Ajinkya Rahane – a batsman coming back from injury and struggling for form. But Virat Kohli stuck by his decision and Rahane responded with an 82 in the first innings. A stand out feature of Kohli's captaincy is that he believes in the ability of a cricketer and gives importance to the experience the player has gained in international cricket. In hindsight, the confidence showed by him on players such as Rahane and Wriddhiman Saha, proved to be fruitful for the team.
The quality of our spinners allow our fast bowlers to attack. The spinners keep things tight and put the batsman under pressure; and when the ball starts to reverse swing, the pacers go on the offensive. All three seamers were able to get the ball to reverse swing but Umesh Yadav – with his pace and variations in length – was in a different league. The length he bowls allows him to swing both the new and the old ball. Ever since the Delhi Test match against South Africa, we have seen him provide vital breakthroughs for the team. A noticeable change is his wrist position and balance at the crease. Without a doubt, Umesh Yadav is the most improved bowler in the last season and a half.

: Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi demanded on Friday that petrol and diesel be brought under the Goods and Services Tax regime to prevent "excessive profiteering".He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not view the new tax reform to further electoral interests. "Time to correct the 'One Nation, Seven Tax', multiple form filing and draconian power of taxman. Make it 'Good' and 'Simple' beyond rhetoric," Gandhi said on Twitter.In a series of tweets, he said, "Wish Modiji viewed economic slide and GST mess from prism of solving suffering of people than furthering electoral interests."The Congress leader said, "Then, 1st step would be to bring Petrol/Diesel under GST to prevent excessive profiteering from common man as GOI alone earns Rs 2,73,000 crore."His statement came on a day when the GST Council met to give relief to small and medium enterprises and exporters. In a video message on the Congress Twitter handle, Gandhi asked the government to support small and medium businesses and the informal sector to create jobs and "not unleash taxmen on them".He asked the prime minister to focus on job creation. Gandhi said around 30,000 youth are demanding jobs and only 450 get them everyday, thereby creating an army of 10- lakh unemployed youth a month.He warned that the youth, farmers and small businessmen are getting angry at the government and this is not good for the country."This will be dangerous for the country," he said. Gandhi accused the government of "attacking" these small and medium businesses first through demonetisation and then through the GST."Instead of helping them, the government is attacking them... These are brutal attacks on these sectors which will wipe them out. Without respecting these sectors you cannot get jobs... For employment generation, small and informal sectors need to be helped," he said.The Congress leader alleged that the government was spending all its energies on big businesses but neglecting the small and medium sectors.On Twitter, he said the textiles sector is the second biggest job generator that yearns for correcting the "distorted" GST structure."Traders, MSMEs, small businesses suffer and cronies profit," Gandhi said.

Ethan Hawke: It's the whole thing that made me want to do the part. I have a cabin in Nova Scotia that I got when I was divorced. I've been going up there for fifteen years. I know who this guy is.

"The Holder report could have been written by a law student who took an introductory corporate governance course," said Erik Gordon, a technology and entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. "The board shares responsibility for the wreck."Uber retained Holder's firm in February after a female former employee publicly accused the company of brazen sexual harassment. A wake of scandals followed, including a criminal investigation of the company's use of technology to evade regulators, a lawsuit alleging stolen self-driving car technology and a string of allegations relating to a toxic culture.On Tuesday, David Bonderman, a founder of private equity firm TPG Capital, an Uber investor, resigned from the board after making a sexist comment about women talking too much at the Uber staff meeting convened to discuss the Holder report.The resignation leaves Uber's board with seven voting members and four vacant seats. Unlike the boards of most big companies, Uber's directors have little executive experience. In addition to Kalanick, the board includes co-founder and Chairman Garrett Camp, early employee Ryan Graves, venture capitalist Bill Gurley, Saudi investor Yasir al-Rumayyan and media impresaria Arianna Huffington. Wan Ling Martello, an executive vice president at Nestle, was added to the board this week as an independent director.The Holder recommendations call for a restructured board, but the recommendation to install an independent board chair was left up to the board only to consider.

The Canucks have uncovered a host of others outside of their first-round marquee picks who have NHL upside, including defenceman Guillaume Brisebois, forwards Lukas Jasek and Kole Lind, plus netminder Michael DiPietro. Meanwhile, blueliners Gustav Forsling and Nikita Tryamkin, who had potential to be the best pick of them all, have already played NHL games.
There's also Ben Hutton, who could be a good buy-low candidate for a team looking for a defenceman who could really benefit from a change of scenery and a new coaching staff.
Hutton's salary is problematic at US $2.8 million, but he did play well when he was paired with pretty much any defenceman not named Erik Gudbranson.
“Clean water is absolutely essential to our health and safety,” Assemblyman Sean Ryan (D-Buffalo) said. “We've seen far too much water main breaks and drinking water contamination from that threaten the health of our families- it's important that we make robust investments in replacing old pipes and water mains.”

Praful is a healer and a giver. In all his relationships, Praful has strived to be a friend before becoming a boyfriend. His love tales are more dramatic than any Bollywood masala film. Like all our romantic stories, his also have a pattern. His boyfriends have told him that he is lucky for them – when they begin dating him, a few unsettled matters in their lives, like getting a visa which had been pending for months, fell into place.
Praful had his first serious relationship when he was 22 years old. Despite the fact that he had met his boyfriend – a footballer – online without seeing him in person, Praful was in love.
They could build an interactive visitor center, he said. They could build reconstructions of the grass houses and granaries the Wichita used. They could employ flint-knappers who could show how skilled craftsmen made arrowheads and knife blades.

This was said by Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) Chairman Dr Muhammad Qasim Bughio said on Sunday.
Blessing had been living with her son, Thomas Blessing, and his girlfriend in the girlfriend's condo. They moved her in about six months ago from out of state.
The girlfriend called 911. When deputies arrived, they ordered Blessing to come outside but were met with silence. They found her sitting in her reclining chair, her son deceased in a bedroom.
It was later determined during an interview with the suspect that she believed her life was being taken as a result of her son and his girlfriend attempting to place her into an assisted living facility, police said.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month unveiled plans to repeal the rules that prohibit internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content. The 2015 rules bar broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to web content.
The FTC will investigate if internet providers fail to make accurate disclosures or if they engage in deceptive or unfair acts or practices. ”The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers,” said Acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen.
OVERTIME — The Canucks held college free-agent meetings Friday and will target defencemen and forwards who are ready to sign or will leave school early and NHL ready. Sam Gagner suffered concussion-like symptoms Thursday after a heavy check on Tomas Jurco. He was re-evaluated Friday and his prognosis for recovery was expected to be revealed Saturday. Nic Dowd was expected to replace Gagner on Saturday against the Tampa Bay Lightning.
The England fixtures will be Australia's first international matches since a ball-tampering scandal during a Test match against South Africa in Cape Town in March led to the ongoing suspensions of then captain Steve Smith, his deputy David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft.
The former Ireland batsman was included in England squads for both the Scotland match and the Australia series announced Wednesday despite suffering a finger injury fielding for county side Middlesex during a One-Day Cup match against Somerset on Sunday.
For the second consecutive week, the Cowboys are facing a team with a 10-day break. The advantage for the Packers does not lie so much in the schematics, but the rest, which allowed four key offensive players more time to get ready. But it's not like Rodgers needs time to get ready to face a Rod Marinelli-coached defense. Including playoffs, Rodgers has thrown 29 touchdown passes with just eight interceptions in 15 games. Most important, Rodgers is 13-2 in those games, dating back to 2008. Packers 33, Cowboys 27 -- Todd Archer
Accelerating CAF II is one of the FCC's legitimate claims to progress over the last year, which it rightfully gave pole position in Chairman Pai's highly selective summary of the agency's 2017 accomplishments. The fund was proposed back in 2013, but for various reasons never saw the light of day. Pai made it an official priority of his upon taking the Chairman office, and to his credit he and the others have made good on his promise to get it out the door in 2018.
“With our decisions today, we jump the last big hurdle before holding a first-of-its-kind universal service reverse auction,” said Chairman Pai in an accompanying statement. “And I'll remind
Maybe I missed it. I thought my role as Acting Chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ended in November 2013? But if the authority implied by Chairman Pai's statement is one I possess, then the Tribal broadband item would be adopted by close of business today. Correction: I did not withdraw my vote. My vote on the initial item was cast seven months ago and in case you missed it, I'm currently in the minority. I'm the holdup? How is voting to approve the entire text of the item but dissenting in part, as I did today, because it did not go far enough to support our tribal communities, delaying the vote?
I await Chairman Pai's retort.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP)  The search has been called off for the six veteran fishermen aboard a crabbing boat missing in the icy, turbulent Bering Sea.
Ducks defenseman Cam Fowler skated Monday for the first time since April 4, when he took a knee-on-knee hit from Calgary defenseman Mark Giordano and was knocked out of the lineup.
Fowler wouldn't say if he thought the damaging open-ice hit was delivered on purpose. Giordano wasn't penalized but he was challenged to fight later in that game by Ducks defenseman Josh Manson.

For the Sharks, it was, well, also about everybody. The series stats against the Ducks are misleading in some respects, as the 8-1 win in Game 3 distorts the numbers. But like the Golden Knights, the Sharks managed to get just about everyone on the scoresheet, with 15 of the 18 skaters notching at least one point. The three Sharks who didn't have a point (a defenseman from each pairing) were on the ice for nine of the Sharks ten even strength goals, and only two goals against.

The pair of Russians are among the top 10 NHL defencemen in shot blocks (Zaitsev tied for the league lead before Monday's games) and both will be called upon again tonight. Provorov was on the Maple Leafs' radar in the 2015 draft had they opted for a defenceman and if Noah Hanifin was gone. Zaitsev is a key on the penalty kill as well and leads all Toronto blueliners in ice time.

And yet Sanjay Leela Bhansali does not make him either a simpering laughing stock or some woebegone tragic figure. Malik Kafur, sly and conniving, is a go-getter and not unashamed to broadcast his proximity to the sultan.

But Kafur has the last laugh.
One of the biggest problems with Star Wars movies that many fans and detractors like to point out is how incompetent the Stormtroopers are, especially their marksman abilities. A hallmark of every movie shows the Stormtroopers firing wildly, missing even the slowest moving targets and placing shots nowhere near their intended aim. Their abilities are highlighted in A New Hope from some Obi-Wan dialogue, but we never really get to see their "precise" handiwork. That has all changed now that one competent Stormtrooper has been identified.
Nadal had the worst possible draw despite being the top seed as he was drawn to face the dangerous Frenchman Lucas Pouille, the player who sent him crashing out of the US Open last year.

Vishal stressed that the ongoing strike is not a selfish choice made my the TFPC as an act of ego. "Rather than using the term strike or shut down, I would choose to say this as an attempt to renovate and revamp the industry. We have been negotiating with various stakeholders including directors union, cameramen association, theatre owners association with the intent of bringing out some changes. This shutdown is definitely not an act of ego. Producers strive a lot to make a film, and when it comes to releasing them, it's a whole new set of struggles they face at that time. It has to change."

Oakfield led off their last at-bat with a double to right-center, and the next batter laid down a bunt. Freshman first baseman Katie Goethal charged and tried to make a play at third to eliminate the winning run, but the ball trickled past Laine Dirksmeyer and the game was over.

It was the 39th over of the Australian innings and the scoreboard read 183/4. With both the batsmen in Jonathan Merlo and Nathan McSweeney well-settled at the crease, Australia looked all set for a total close to 300 runs.
In a match like the final with the players being so young, big match pressure generally gets the better of the players. And it often affects the bowling side more than the batting side. However, the India juniors showed no such signs sticking to their disciplined approach without trying anything fancy and waited for the Australian batsmen to make mistakes themselves.
The match was there for the taking for both sides at that point in the last 10 overs. With the pitch favouring the batsmen, Australia could have really gone on to put up a big score on the board. Instead, they lost six wickets for just 33 runs in a span of eight overs, finally being bowled out for a paltry 216 runs, a score which was never going to be enough on that kind of pitch considering the run of form the Indian batsmen were in.
Players are bound to make mistakes at this age level. They are bound to be nervous as well. Apart from one dropped catch which was quite a difficult chance early on in the Australian innings, the Indian players didn't let any chance go as far as their fielding was concerned. The Australian fielders, on the other hand, missed a couple of easy chances which only allowed the Indian batsmen to make the run chase even easier. Harvik Desai's catch to dismiss Jason Sangha off Kamlesh Nagarkoti's bowling summed up the difference in fielding standards between the two sides as well.
Even the bowlers bowled tight lines and lengths and didn't let the Australian batsmen to get any momentum in their innings. Yes, there were those occasional loose deliveries but the Indian bowlers corrected their mistakes quickly. The Australian bowlers didn't find any rhythm going in their bowling whatsoever. Even their best bowler in the side, Lloyd Pope was taken for more than eight runs per over in his five overs.

Ideally, Kohli would have picked Yadav or Shami as his first-choice fast bowler, for their ability to move the ball as well as using the bounce on English wickets on account of pace. At present though, with flat pitches laid out in favour of the batsmen, it is imperative to hold a steady line, not allowing batsmen any room to work with.

But he ranks 15th in FanGraphs' version of WAR among NL position players (3.5), 10th in weighted on-base average (.394), seventh in weighted runs created + (147) and seventh in on-base plus slugging percentage (.972). The timing of his home runs has been impeccable — but it's hard to put him ahead of first basemen like Arizona's Paul Goldschmidt (.425 wOBA) and Cincinnati's Joey Votto (.431).

A video shows an ice fisherman getting eaten by an orca.
A video purportedly showing an orca eating an ice fisherman has been making its way around the Internet for several years:
It shows an Inuit fisherman sitting on a frozen body of water with a fishing rod, when suddenly a gigantic orca bursts through the ice and grabs him. However, this is is not genuine footage; as the voiceover might indicate, it is actually an edited version of a commercial for Tip Top bread.
The original advertisement was created in 2002 by advertising company M&C Saatchi for George Weston Foods, which owns Tip Top Bakeries and directed by Roger Tompkins. Part of the commercial was later edited out, and the clip was then circulated as though it shows a real ice fisherman getting eaten by a killer whale.
The Good Party (İP) Chairwoman Meral Akşener deleted tweets dated in 2013 responding to Gülenist Terror Group (FETÖ) suspect Emre Uslu, who stated he wants to see Akşener as a presidential candidate in the 2014 elections.
Uslu, a renowned figure of the terrorist group who fled to the U.S. before the coup attempt, is known for his notorious pro-FETÖ propaganda and is on a wanted list due to his alleged links with the terrorist group. He is also known for his tweets implying the date of the FETÖ coup attempt on July 15, 2016. On Sept. 14, 2015, Uslu responded to a Tweet asking him when he would return to Turkey by saying July 2016: "How long do you think it will take you to visit the homeland even if it's just for a vacation? Or have you completely given up on the idea?'' a Twitter user asked Uslu, who responded by saying: "July 2016...'' His name was also mentioned in the Andrey Karlov case, the Russian ambassador to Ankara, who was assassinated on Dec. 19, 2016 by a suspected FETÖ member in Ankara. Akşener founded the new party, İP, which mostly consists of former Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) dissidents, in October 2017. Akşener was a prominent figure among MHP dissidents who heavily criticized the policies of the MHP's chairman of 20 years, Devlet Bahçeli. The intra-party debate ended when the dissidents were dismissed from the party after a heated process ended in courts. İP has not participated in any elections so far, and its performance in the upcoming elections is highly speculated. However, Akşener has already announced that she will run for president in the upcoming June 24 early parliamentary and presidential elections. Akşener has also been accused of having close ties with FETÖ by the chairman of her former party, the MHP. In fact MHP Chairman Bahçeli claimed in December 2015 that FETÖ used one of the party's candidates as a "political tool."

Chairman Bautista countered and said that it's all about the money. He accused the wife of allegedly blackmailing or extorting a hefty amount of money from him.

Artefacts, believed to be thousands of years old, have been missing from the Archaeology department of Aligarh Muslim University.The Chairman of the History department and head of the archaeological section of AMU Professor Nadeem Rezavi has ordered a probe. Speaking to News18, Professor Nadeem Rezavi said, “There were around 9000 artefacts in this section of the University but no record is available. After I joined the department in 2017, I came to know about the missing artefacts and have ordered a probe into the matter. Since the number of artefacts is in thousands, the enquiry will take two to three months to know the exact number of artefacts missing from the stock.”“The loss of these artefacts is a loss for the nation as these were national treasures. Proper enquiry will be conducted on the people who were working that time, including those that have retired,” added Professor Rezavi while speaking to news18 over the phone.Apart from this many other artefacts have also been damaged in the process.As per the information from AMU sources, some of the missing artefacts were as old as 5000 years and were collected from various excavation sites of Atranjikhera, Fatehpur Sikri and Jhakhera. Interestingly, some of the artefacts were collected by the university's founder, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, himself including rare Hindu and Buddhist sculptures.The missing artefacts include wires and bangles of ochre-coloured pottery (OCP) culture and terracotta balls of painted grey ware (PGW) culture. While OCP culture is a 2nd millennium BC Bronze Age culture of the Indo-Gangetic plain, extending from eastern Punjab to western Uttar Pradesh, the PGW culture is an Iron Age culture of the western Gangetic plain and the Ghaggar-Hakra valley, lasting from roughly 1200 BC to 600 BC.

After off-center cheerleaders hastily form into "winter" and "magic," a big band breaks into a rendition of “Winter Wonderland."It gets better (worse): Kids rap about snowmen in “Do the Frosty.” Dancers storm the field in gaudy parachute pants. Players from the 1980 Miracle on Ice Olympic hockey team hold sparklers as Queen's “Don't Stop Me Now” plays for some reason. Then Gloria Estefan takes the stage. After dutifully singing (lip-syncing?) along to karaoke versions of “Live for Loving You” and “Get On Your Feet,” she finishes with a reprisal “Winter Magic.”No amount of frigid wonder and Gloria Estefan could keep viewers tuned into CBS for the halftime show, which got beat out in the ratings by a livespecial on FOX.Minneapolis' Super Bowl XXVI halftime show was another dud in a string of late-‘80s and early-‘90s flops. Back then, the stage that Coldplay, Beyoncé, and Bruno Mars will rock Sunday was once dominated by the likes of George Burns, Mickey Rooney, the cult-like smile parade that is Up with People, and a lame magic trick from impersonator/magician Elvis Presto The next year, the NFL nixed Timberline and grabbed Michael Jackson for a guaranteed smash, ushering in the “Retrain-Your-Bladder Era" of Super Bowl halftime shows, to borrow the Washington Post's framing. After the Metrodome game, the show turned into a star-studded cavalcade featuring everyone from Stevie Wonder to Britney Spears to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ballooning every year into the overstimulating sharkfest we know and love today.Our dearly departed stadium never hosted the game again, but Minneapolis gained back a little halftime cred in 2007, when Prince ripped through “Purple Rain” in a Miami downpour . The Super Bowl will return to Minnesota in 2018 at brand-new U.S. Bank Stadium. Let's hope the stadium's “Built for the Bold” theme leads to a better song-and-dance number than “Winter Magic.”

Harsh words have long been a staple in the game of brinksmanship between Washington and Pyongyang, usually followed by some kind of calm. This time, “the era of strategic patience is over,” Vice President Mike Pence says, and if it wasn't clear already from the U.S. missile strike in Syria and the “mother of all bombs” in Afghanistan, he put it bluntly on his trip to the Demilitarized Zone. “North Korea would do well not to test [President Trump's] resolve — or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region.” He also gave a cold stare across the border, while North Korean soldiers took pictures of him and his entourage. Pence continues his Asian trip today.

MULTAN - PTI Vice Chairman Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that more important personalities will defect from PML-N and PPP to Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI), and both the parties would hardly find even a single candidate in the coming 2018 election.
Shes so much fun to watch, Peters said of Cady. Shes only a sophomore and we have two freshmen catchers behind her. I tell them what a great role model they have. Theyre good athletes themselves, but I say if you can watch how (Cady) handles herself behind the plate, how she handles the pitcher, frames the pitch, and her focus at the plate, to put that in your memory bank.
A year ago, with nearly all of the same players, the Wolves reached the Division 1 semifinals before losing a heart-breaker to Grandville, 2-1. Last seasons team featured five freshmen starters and two sophomores in the lineup, which has led to elevated expectations in 2018 and beyond.
Their spinners are enticing rival batsmen into their web of leg and off-cutters and the pacers are generating a lot of reverse swings in the middle overs, choking the run flow and thus putting pressure on the rival batsmen. No wonder, except for India, every team has struggled to score against Pakistan.
India toyed with Pakistan in their first game, making their bowlers first spray the ball around and then hobble back to the dressing room with injured bodies and battered egos. And though India lost to Sri Lanka, its batting lineup has always looked formidable. The Indian batsmen have made 300-plus scores look child's play so far.
That, McVay said, should have been the telltale sign that no deal had been struck with star defensive lineman Aaron Donald.
Lineman Michael Brockers said Donald's absence was felt Saturday in a 13-10 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Brockers, Ethan Westbrooks and Louis Trinca-Pasat started on the line in defensive coordinator Wade Phillips' 3-4 scheme.

Though the case was heard in the chamber, the two counsels in the matter spoke to newsmen shortly after.
Doing the Naagin dance in someone's face is a distasteful, school-boyish way of celebration, totally unbecoming of a set of professional sportsmen who are supposed to be the ambassadors of their country. Perhaps Mushfiqur Rahim and Co need to take a leaf out of the book of the Iceland football team, who have united an entire nation not just by virtue of their giant-killing acts on the big stage, but also with their volcano clap celebration, and endeared themselves to the world.
Bangladesh may have scripted a fine win on Friday that gave them the ticket to the Nidahas Trophy final. But the occasion was marred by some manic celebrations, heated arguments between Bangladesh's reserve player Nurul Hasan, who had carried drinks on to the field, and Sri Lankan captain Thisara Perera. Bangladesh captain and one of the leading all-rounders in the world, Shakib Al Hasan, clearly gestured towards the batsmen, calling them back after an umpiring decision did not go their way in the final stage of the match. He later denied having asked the batsmen to withdraw.
There was complete chaos after the match and Bangladesh batsman Tamim Iqbal was seen having to calm down a furious Kusal Mendis as the players from both teams continued to argue. The glass of the Bangladesh dressing room was also found shattered, apparently the handiwork of some of the visiting players who had gone berserk in their celebrations. The incident made Sri Lakan legend Sanath Jayasuriya to term it "third class behaviour" in a tweet, which he deleted later.
Willis had just been sent to the Redblacks from Edmonton in exchange for defensive lineman Jake Ceresna. Ottawa turned around and sent him to Vancouver.

The doors of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) are open to all Kurds without any conditions or descriptions in the upcoming period of local and general elections, MHP Deputy Chairman Celal Adan said.
Speaking in a televised interview Thursday, MHP Deputy Chairman Adan said his party has never hurt any Kurdish person. "The doors of the MHP are open to them. The doors of the MHP are open to Kurds without any description," he said, underscoring that the MHP is the most dynamic political party in the southeastern and eastern region.
Asserting that citizens lend great support to the idea of the alliance, Adan said cooperation between the AK Party and the MHP gives comfort to people. The two parties have been on the same page on several issues for a while, and they agreed to form an alliance in the 2019 local and general elections as well as the presidential elections. MHP Chairman Devlet Bahçeli has called it a "people's alliance," while President and AK Party Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan termed it a "domestic and national alliance." The alliance has recently been termed the "national agreement."
MHP Chairman Bahçeli previously made it publicly known that his party would not nominate a candidate and instead support President Erdoğan's re-election, which became the first step toward a political alliance for the 2019 presidential elections.

In a new interview with British GQ, the Foo Fighters frontman discussed the soon-to-be-released song. Apparently, it was one of those songs that just doesn't work out the way you hope it does. For years, Grohl tried to record the track and even asked Bowie to help out and record it for a movie soundtrack. According to Grohl, Bowie wasn't all that into the movie, so the collaboration never happened.
He also spent months traveling the country, talking to lobbyists, militiamen and gun enthusiasts — including his duck-hunting cousin, Pete — for a special, “Jordan Klepper Solves Guns,” that aired this year. The experience left him surprisingly hopeful.
Rookie defenceman Alex Kannok Leipert bagged the winner at 16:54 of the third period, sneaking in from the right point to the face-off circle and converting a Brayden Watts pass from behind the net after Ty Ronning had kept a play alive by sprawling to swipe a loose puck away from a Medicine Hat defender.
Kannok Leipert has been a healthy scratch three of the past seven games with the Giants, which adds another layer to the goal. Bowen Byram, the superb 16-year-old, has gotten the majority of the attention amongst the Vancouver blue liners, but youngsters Kannok Leipert, 17, and Kaleb Bulych, who just turned 18, have proven more than capable. They've been taking turns sitting out since the trade deadline, when Vancouver picked up over-age defenceman Brennan Riddle in a bid to bring a poise and a calm to their own zone.
Defenceman Dylan MacPherson, with a bank shot off a Vancouver defender at 10:12 of the third period that made it 4-4, was among the goal scorers for the Tigers.

Finally, it's over, but for Jughead the problems are just beginning. Not only did he just have to watch his girlfriend strip in front of a room full of strangers, but now he finds out that his dad can't retire from the Serpents after all. FP informs Jug that he found out about his little drug-delivering deal with Penny Peabody, and even though it breaks his heart that Jughead did the one thing FP told him not to do, FP decides to save his son and re-enter the Serpents, taking Jughead's place. And to make things worse, FP, who started off the episode as a sober man, took a shot right in front of Jughead as he was surrounded by fellow Serpents. Poor Juggy, accidentally ruining his dad's life. Although to be fair, FP used to be a pretty awful father (remember, Jughead was basically homeless and living at the drive-in, and then FP was an accessory in Jason Blossom's murder), so it's a little unclear why he's guilt-tripping Jughead so much right now.

"Now China has overreached so much they have alienated much of the business community."

There are absolutely no gaudy rhinestones to be found in Wassam's cowboy lineage. Both his parents, Corky and Carol Wassam, descend from Colorado homesteaders in Longmont and Tructon, Colo., (east of Calhan). Paternal great, great-grandfather, John Hugo Anderson, farmed and ranched in Longmont.
Its durability lies in the craftsmanship of four young saddlemakers who'd learned leather-working skills at the world-famous HH Heiser Saddle Company. Their teachers were men who'd rode the open range and moved cattle herds north into Colorado. In 1945, and after Heiser closed up shop, the budding apprentices founded Colorado Saddlery to continue the former brand's heritage, quality and price.
Wassam recalled that Ivo Shults, grandfather of friend Todd Shults, was among all those countless cowboys who, for decades, bought every piece of their tack there. One day in 1948, Ivo mounted up to drive a herd from Meeker to Rifle, Colo. He loaded his steers onto a Denver-bound cattle train and rode right along with them to the Mile-High City. After studying an enticing, eye-popping inventory, Shults proudly picked out his new saddle and carried it with him on the return train to Rifle. The following morning he rode another train for two more days back to Meeker. Yes, Colorado Saddlery certainly was a destination then and, for Wassam, the company has always been in his blood as much as is the cowboy way of life. It was only a matter of time until he chose it as his corporate destination.
Colorado Saddlery maintains not only a massive brick and mortar outlet for 21st century customers, but also offers a worldwide online presence (www.coloradosaddlery.com), plus overseas wholesale buyers and stores for its fine saddles and other equipment made in Colorado. This versatility allows horse owners in Germany, Sweden, Russia, Italy and elsewhere to easily obtain the same top-quality merchandise that American cowboys have long depended upon. Wassam reported that one of those faithful U.S. customers was actor John Wayne, who rode Colorado Saddlery saddles in many of his movies, including "True Grit."

Horton began his Leaf career in 1949, and at one point would play 468 consecutive games (a record for defencemen since surpassed by Karlis Skrastins in 2007). Like Baun, he was a physical defenceman. Opponent John Ferguson Sr. once remarked “Horton's the hardest body checker I've ever come up against. He's as strong as an ox and hits with terrific force.”
Horton wasn't a scrapper or fighter, as Bobby Hull remarked “There were defensemen you had to fear because they were vicious and would slam you into the boards from behind… But you respected Tim Horton because he didn't need that type of intimidation. He used his tremendous strength and talent to keep you in check.”

He quickly showed he was not going to back down from anyone, taking on the NHL's heavyweights.

Joel Edmundson, meanwhile, is slated to be an RFA after this season.
But due to my lack of experience, I have never been able to write pig poetry. When I attended veterinary school there were only three pigs west of Scott City, Kan., and they were in the Salt Lake City Zoo. In the world of cowboy music no one has risen to claim the title Ghost Riders in the Sty.
I have held the contention that most cowboy poetry is funny due to that close relationship between humor and tragedy. Workin' livestock is dangerous and those of us who do it get hurt … a lot! So the only way to deal with the pain is to laugh about it. And you quadruple the chance of injury (and therefore humor) by adding a horse to the equation. Well, most people don't work pigs a'horseback, so you don't have as many wrecks. But where there's a will there's a way.

WASHINGTON — Congressman Adrian Smith, R-Neb., was selected to serve on the congressional delegation that traveled to North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations in Montreal last week, where he met with negotiators, government officials and business leaders to stress the importance of the trade agreement. "NAFTA is vital to Nebraska agriculture, and I have been focused throughout the negotiations on making the case to do no harm to the ag economy," Smith said. "I am pleased to have the opportunity to serve on this congressional delegation and bring Nebraska's voice to the table in the next round of NAFTA talks. As negotiations move forward, I will continue to lead on this crucial issue and work to strengthen the market access ag producers have achieved under NAFTA." Smith serves on the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade.

The bill, introduced by Congressman Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, would seek to settle all federal ownership claims by providing legal certainty to landowners along the Red River.
Congressman Thornberry's bill, and the Senate companion S. 90 championed by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, would settle the dispute by requiring a survey of the majority of the 116 mile stretch of the contested area using the gradient boundary survey method developed and backed by the Supreme Court to find the proper ownership boundary between the public and private land. This survey is to be completed within two years and is to be performed by qualified surveyors chosen by the states of Texas and Oklahoma.
But Philadelphia also just might have the one thing that can give Brady and the Patriots problems in the biggest game of all. That would be a strong defensive line that goes seven deep and is capable of creating pressure without the help of the blitz. In these playoffs, the Eagles have sent five or more rushers just 16 percent of the time but still generated pressure on 35 percent of dropbacks. Part of the reason for that is the depth that has allowed them to keep their defensive line fresh. Philadelphia had seven defensive linemen play at least 400 snaps in 2017.
On the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Jan. 26, Assemblyman Anthony D'Urso traveled to a small synagogue in Naples, Italy, where he was reunited with the descendants of a Jewish family who he helped hide from the Nazis as a little boy.
The D'Urso family protected the large Ascarelli family in their hometown of Formia, Italy, halfway between Naples and Rome, in 1944. While he was just a young child, the future assemblyman was responsible for acting as a lookout and calling out to his mother when German soldiers approached.
The reunion in Naples included the descendants and extended family of Tommaso Sinigallia, the Holocaust survivor who wrote the diary, which the Sinigallia family expects to publish next year. They have already invited the assemblyman and his wife to return to Naples and celebrate its publication. A copy of the diary has been submitted to Yad Vashem for authentication and D'Urso is cautiously optimistic that his parents and older siblings will soon be recognized as Righteous Among the Nations.
The assemblyman wept openly when he hugged Ester Sinigallia, a daughter of the family that was hidden. Later, she told him, “I came here to thank you.”

In the end, the film is just as interested in Beuys the thinker, activist and German Green Party founder member, the generous teacher, a man whose engagement with social issues and agit-prop attacks on the power of big money anticipate the ideas and methods of Occupy Wall Street and other recent grass-roots protest movements.

That Taylor was enduring a torrid time in Test cricket around the 2014-15 period did not help matters. It seemed like he was destined to remain a wingman forever.
The table shows the record of New Zealand batsmen since 2016 in Tests.
The middle-order batsman averages a stunning 68.06 against the Caribbeans in 12 Tests with four hundreds including a double-hundred at Dunedin. On Monday, he crossed 1000 runs against the West Indies in Test cricket and is now New Zealand's highest run-getter against them.
As they started bowling short, his natural instinct to cut and pull took over and he creamed the quicker bowlers to all corners of Seddon Park. Gabriel, the only bowler who appeared dominant against Taylor, was rarely turned to in the latter half of Taylor's knock. It probably wouldn't have mattered as the middle-order batsman had started nailing every shot in the book. He raced to his 17th Test ton in no time and capped off his record-breaking feat with equally impressive words at the end of the day.

That dropped interception, though, meant the Elks had another chance. Fourth-and-10 from the Royals' 35-yard line with 1:03 remaining in the game, this was it.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's fantasy romance “The Shape of Water” led nominations for the Golden Globes on Monday, heading a list of dramas and comedies on issues ranging from press freedom, war, racism and the many aspects of love. Nominees for the 75th Golden Globe Awards, Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama category, (L-R) Timothee Chalamet, Daniel Day Lewis, Tom Hanks, Gary Oldman and Denzel Washington are seen in a combination of file photos. REUTERS/File Photos“The Shape of Water,” a surreal drama about a relationship between a river creature and a mute cleaner, collected seven nods across the board, including for best director; actors Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins; screenplay and score. Del Toro said he was grateful for the recognition, adding in a statement: “Above all, ‘The Shape of Water' is about love overcoming fear and embracing the Other.” “The Post,” Steven Spielberg's timely drama about press freedom, followed with six nominations, including for its director and stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. The Golden Globes are chosen by the 90-plus journalists of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, but nominees often mirror the top films and actors nominated in January for the Oscars, the movie industry's highest awards. “The Shape of Water” and “The Post” are also seen as front-runners for Oscars. They will compete for the top drama prize at the Jan. 7 Golden Globe ceremony in Beverly Hills against small-town tale “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” which also got six nominations; British World War Two tale “Dunkirk”; and “Call Me By Your Name,” a gay romance starring actor nominees Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer.

Virat Kohli's team, for the first time in the ongoing tour, can be rightly be termed favourites to go 2-0 up come Sunday. While the rousing win at Kingsmead certainly would boost their spirits, it is also the fact the neither star batsman AB de Villiers nor captain Faf du Plessis will ply their services for the hosts at the Supersport Park, with the latter getting ruled out for the remaining limited-overs fixtures against the Indians.
One of the biggest talking points of the first one-dayer was Ajinkya Rahane's well-paced innings of 79 batting at No 4. The Mumbai batsman has had to spend a lot of time warming the bench in the past, given the fact that he was considered a back-up opener to the in-form Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan. The team management's decision to re-slot the senior batsman at No 4 has paid the dividends for both the batsman and the team, and he will have to produce a couple of such knocks in the coming matches to make himself a first-choice for that position.
The decision to go with two wrist spinners at Durban also worked wonders for the Indians, as Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal helped stem the flow of runs in the middle overs of the South African innings, which built pressure on the opposition batsmen and led to breakthroughs. The Centurion track was described as 'subcontinent-like' when the two teams met for the second Test, and even though the Proteas will persuade curator Bryan Bloy to make it more 'South African' in nature, the popular perception is that there will be a lot in the pitch for both batsmen and spinners.
CHENNAI: Dinesh Karthik has been in and out of the Indian team for 14 years. On Sunday, though, his stunning eight-ball 29 helped India notch up a face-saving win against Bangladesh in the Nidahas Trophy final, bringing the spotlight firmly on the Tamil Nadu wicketkeeper batsman. Social media is abuzz that Karthik should now be considered as India's No. 1 option for the wicketkeeper-batsman's slot in limited-overs cricket, but that's probably a far cry.The Indian team management has made it quite clear that MS Dhoni , despite his recent struggles with the bat, is the No. 1 option for that slot going into the 2019 World Cup. Even so, Karthik, who has close to 20000 domestic runs across formats, can be considered a pure batsman in the limited-overs line-up.Dhoni, quite clearly, is no longer the huge hitter who could clear the boundaries towards the fag end of the innings with ease. He looks more comfortable pacing the innings at No. 5 and India are in search of a finisher. Karthik could be the answer.Skipper Rohit Sharma , under whom Karthik flourished in Mumbai Indians, had exactly that in mind when he held back the 'keeper for the final burst against Bangladesh. “He was upset with not being sent at No. 6, but he'll be quite happy now,” Rohit said.And it's not just about the odd T20. India's regular skipper Virat Kohli has given Karthik a few chances in ODIs and his scores in the last six innings read: 50*, 37, 64*, 4*, 0 & 26*. However, the 32-year-old didn't get a single game in the six ODIs in South Africa.That hasn't dampened his spirits, though, and in the last eight T20s he has played, Karthik has a strike-rate in excess of 150 and he has been dismissed only once.Former India cricketer Pravin Amre , who worked with the Tamil Nadu batsman in 2015, attributed this consistency to Karthik's “newfound calmness”. “This is a drastic change we see in Karthik. His calmness is so critical. We are seeing the best of Karthik now. He has to be a regular in the side from here on. He can be a floater anywhere and in recent times he has been a finisher. I think that's the biggest gain for India from this series,” Amre told TOI.Kris Srikkanth, former chairman of selectors, reckons Karthik has finally proved himself a match-winner on the big stage: “It was fantastic to see Karthik deliver under pressure. He was always a talented batsman with great potential. But now, he has showed his calibre as a finisher and match-winner in a high pressure situation at the right time.”Tamil Nadu coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar said that the domestic cricket grind and past experiences have combined to turn Karthik into an “all-condition” cricketer.“You don't become a matchwinner overnight. He has understood how to deal with pressure and analysed past experiences. The number of not outs he has in the last year underlines his mindset to see the side through. I don't think he should be warming the bench from now,” said Kanitkar.

Nigel Barratt, Chairman of the Woodbridge Tide Mill, believes that to produce healthy and tasty flour both craft and science are needed. The mill sits on the river Deben in East Suffolk and demonstrates how sustainable energy can be used to power the production of up to 10 tonnes of local flour per year. In his talk, ‘Is milling a craft or a science?' at the annual National Mills Weekend in May, Barratt explained that Tide Mill flour has nothing added and nothing taken away as the grain is slowly stone milled and kept cool enough for nutrients and minerals to remain in the flour. Industrial steel roller milling is faster and hotter, which means four essential natural nutrients are removed in the reduction process and have to be added back in to comply with legislation.

The Israelites ate a variety of fresh and saltwater fish, according to both archaeological and textual evidence.[6] Remains of freshwater fish from the Yarkon and Jordan rivers and the Sea of Galilee have been found in excavations, and include St. Peter's fish and mouthbreeders. Saltwater fish discovered in excavations include sea bream, grouper, meager and gray mullet. Most of these come from the Mediterranean, but in the later Iron Age period, some are from the Red Sea.[7] Fishermen supplied fish to inland communities, as remains of fish, including bones and scales, have been discovered at many inland sites. To preserve them for transport, the fish were first smoked or dried and salted.[6] Merchants also imported fish, sometimes from as far as from Egypt, where pickled roe was an export article.[8] Remains of Nile Perch from Egypt have been found, and these must have been smoked or dried, before being imported through the trade network that connected ancient Near Eastern societies.[7] Merchants shipped fish to Jerusalem and there was evidently a significant trade in fish; one of the gates of Jerusalem was called the Fish Gate, named for a fish market nearby.[6][7][9][10] Fish products were salted and dried and sent great distances during the Israelite and Judean monarchies. However, even in the later Persian, Greek and Roman periods, the cost of preserving and transporting fish must have meant that only wealthier inhabitants of the highland towns and cities could afford it, or those who lived close to the sources, where it was less expensive.[7]

For Trump and his followers, debate about such matters is meaningless wonkery, a devious tapestry of words whose twin purposes are to perpetuate the power of elites and to distract patriots from their gut certainty that everything has gone to hell. Deliberation cannot fix anything; wonkery is itself the lie. Only a strongman in possession of his own incontrovertible truth can put things right. Republicans have, for years now, been preparing the ground for this foul harvest: “We're an empire now,” Karl Rove said in 2002, “we create our own reality.” But even Rove could not quite believe what havoc such empire had wrought in Trump.
Anyone who rejects such truths must necessarily be blinded by political correctness. Why “condescend to prove, to discuss, to argue?” To do so would be to join the ranks of the losers. The demagogue lays claim to a deeper truth, which he passes off as unvarnished rather than merely crude. No prissy politesse prevents him from speaking his mind. He paints a Babylon of depravity and decadence to set his followers marching by torchlight. His weak-kneed opponents chastely avert their eyes from the “hellhole” that their politically correct mouths dare not describe. The strongman meanwhile serves up brimming taco bowls of word salad, beguiling acolytes with slapdash jeremiads—a dab here and a dab there insinuating a truth greater than the sum of its parts, but only when viewed from the proper distance, neither so close as to reveal the want of logic nor so remote as to dull the lurid colors.
Chairman David Glass and general manager Dayton Moore have been consistent in saying they view 2014 as the beginning of a window in which they can consistently compete for championships. They've said that knowing their top starting pitcher, James Shields, is almost certain to leave as a free agent this offseason.
Including Butler's buyout and other factors such as pitcher Luke Hochevar's pending free-agency, the Royals should have a little more than $25 million coming off the books to go along with a possible increase in spending. But they are also obligated or likely to pay around $20 million to $25 million in raises to players such as outfielder Alex Gordon, catcher Salvador Perez and first baseman Eric Hosmer.
Warren gained entry into the warm little center of the upper middle class via her marriage to a NASA mathematician, who sent her to Rutgers Law School as soon as her eldest child was weaned off her teet. She thanked him by divorcing him in 1978, 2 years after she graduated from law school, and married her Harvard law professor boyfriend 2 years after that.
There is even one theory that some other planet's astronauts have already been here and that they were the inspiration for the island's 1,000 majestic stone figures. Good varu varu, but Heyerdahl for one isn't buying. "Why would spacemen have left broken stone picks in the quarries?" he said. "They would have had better tools."
Iraqi Shia militiamen who were in Syria assisting Bashar Assad's forces mostly in the Damascus suburbs reportedly are returning home to try to battle the Sunni advance against the Shia-dominated government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. One fighter told AP: “We took part in the fighting in Syria. But now the priority is Iraq.”
The Shia militiamen's exodus from the fight in Syria – some estimates put their number as high as 30,000 – will leave a gap in the Assad war machine. Firas Abi Ali, an analyst with the risk assessment consultancy IHS, says Hezbollah will likely fill the gap left by Shia militiamen returning to Iraq. But he believes the withdrawal won't be accomplished quickly, since ISIS controls the land routes, and the departure as it unfolds probably will “reduce the ability of the Syrian government to mount new offensives and place it on the strategic defensive.”

That, at least, was the plan until they found an even more politically palatable way to pay for their tax cuts than by taking an ax to Medicaid. That's not paying for them. Why would they do that when it would mean their tax cuts would have to be temporary? Because it turns out that they can change the definition of “temporary” to something that's a lot closer to permanent. The trick is that although their tax cuts have to be paid for past the budget window, there's nothing that dictates the length of that budget window. It's 10 years now, but it could be 15 or 20 or even 30 years if they wanted it to be — and some of them, like Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), do.
Incidentally, while we don't talk about Nebraska very often because they don't play Michigan again until 2037, can we take a moment here to applaud the fine decision-makers at Nebraska? They fired a guy who delivered nine win seasons every year because he couldn't seem to win ten games and would occasionally murder a drifter on the sidelines when the waterboy provided the wrong color Gatorade even though we're pretty sure Gatorade doesn't make a “red and blue striped” color. So now they have a very nice gentleman who is strong in Do It Right and not strong in Win. Good job, good effort fellas.
Student swordsman Joseph Legacy tries on some armor. Academy Grand Master Thomas Booth will tap standout students to perform in his weekend program at John Strongbow's Tavern in Old Town. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)
As a former Army Special Forces serviceman (1980-88), Booth has a facility for fighting; as a history major at Yale (Class of 1991, cum laude), he knows the past. He whipped the two together for his first medieval-themed restaurant in Winston-Salem, N.C. To avoid the cartoonish swashbuckling often performed at period-piece shows, he researched authentic styles from the Middle Ages, back when knights were like Hell's Angels on horseback. He locked onto Talhoffer's texts, which had languished in obscurity for nearly 400 years. The first English translation appeared in 2000.
Saleh stayed in Sanaa after he stepped down, but grew increasingly frustrated with his successor, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Feeling sidelined, Saleh helped the Houthis in their conquest of Sanaa in September 2014. That Saleh connived his way back into a position of leadership by embracing his former enemies came as no surprise to Yemenis who knew their longtime leader would never give up power easily. Saleh's move to end the war by violating his alliance with the Houthis and making overtures to Saudi Arabia may salvage his reputation for many Yemenis. Others always viewed him as a necessary dictator, believing that Yemen's messy tribal politics required a strongman who could — at least to some extent — control powerful tribes.
A student travelling on the Central line in rush hour felt a man rub his erection against her leg. Then there was the literary agent on a busy bendy bus who suddenly realised a teenage boy was putting his hand up her skirt; when her boyfriend understandably made a scene, a much older man told him to shut up because she was “asking for it” and she was “a slag”.

4. Los Angeles: This will be a very challenging, but exciting NCAA Regional for all the teams involved. UCLA has a very solid weekend rotation, while San Diego State has the potential to be a scary No. 4 seed with pitchers such as Michael Cederoth, Philip Walby and others leading the charge. Meanwhile, we all know what hard-hitting third baseman Kris Bryant and San Diego are capable of, while Cal Poly is a very solid club with Joey Wagman and Matt Imhof, among others, leading the way. Anyone could come out of this NCAA Regional.
3. Connecticut: Though the Huskies didn't do particularly well in Big East play, they're playing a solid brand of baseball entering the NCAA tournament. UCONN has one of the nation's elite players to watch in second baseman LJ Mazzilli, who's hitting .364 with six homers and 49 RBIs, while starting pitcher Carson Cross can beat anyone, entering the postseason with a 2.50 ERA in 104 1/3 innings.
3. Cal State Fullerton: It's really difficult to be more consistent than the Titans have been this season. Eshelman and Garza have been fantastic on the mound, but two-way star Michael Lorenzen is having a strong campaign, while first baseman Carlos Lopez has a tendency to get big hits. Rick Vanderhook's club is playing at an extremely high level entering the postseason.
Court records indicate that Emily Castro moved to Fort Wayne, Ind., with her boyfriend Deangelo Gonzalez, where she gave birth to her daughter.
Emily Castro suffered from manic depression diagnosed when she was 13, the court record says. On April 4, 2007, a day after her boyfriend moved out, Castro, then 19, allegedly slashed the 11-month-old's throat four times, cut her own neck and wrists and then attempted to drown herself in a nearby creek.

​Below is the list of underclassmen who have forfeited their remaining years of eligibility to enter the NFL draft.
Underclassmen have until Jan. 16 to file declaration papers with the NFL. The league will release an official list of early entrees on Jan. 20.
Zhuk said that Rybak and a friend then left the square, tracking away from its Lenin statue, and headed towards the city's Palace of Culture. A Kia car pulled up, and four men in masks and military fatigues jumped out and grabbed him. Rybak's friends assume the kidnappers must have had a gun. "Vladimir was a sportsman and an ex-policeman. He knew how to handle himself," Zhuk said.
The fly saga began Tuesday, and it was the subject of a news report on Italian TV and almost a dozen YouTube postings that have been viewed more than 750,000 times. Thousands of people also have added commentary, including one who wrote, “But can he duck a shoe?” in reference to a hugely popular video of former president George Bush ducking a shoe thrown at him by an Iraqi cameraman during a news conference in Baghdad.
Several observers in the room gave congratulatory shout-outs. Obama pointed to the floor and instructed an obliging cameraman to get a close-up of the corpse.
The first consul in Seattle to represent Hitler's Germany, which came to power in 1933, was a gentleman of the old school — described as more of a Hindenburg man than one of Hitler's — an experienced diplomat named Dr. Walther Reinhardt. Reinhardt had been posted all over the world, in Montevideo, Rio De Janeiro, New York, Chicago, Zurich and Latvia. He was a steady presence with an academic air: He gave lectures on Goethe and in 1932 won a major award, the Strassburger prize, juried by Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann and Jakob Wasserman, for a biography he'd written of George Washington. By 1932, he was considered the distinguished dean of the local diplomatic corps.
Taipei, Nov. 2 (CNA) Bitcoin is illegal in Taiwan, said Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Tseng Ming-chung (曾銘宗) on Monday after kidnappers in Taiwan tried to collect a ransom through the virtual currency late last month.
“The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!” he tweeted.
And former Milwaukee sheriff David Clarke, highlighting a photo of Wilson in one of her trademark, shiny cowboy hats, tweeted: “.@realDonaldTrump calling Frederica Wilson ‘whacky' is putting it mildly. The woman is a buffoon. Look at her.”
The works represent diverse genres, from Bibles and missals to romance literature and science texts. Dating from the turn of the 10th century until well into the period of the Renaissance, these works give vivid testimony to the creative impulses of the often nameless craftsmen who continually discovered new ways of animating the contents of hand-produced books through inventive and sometimes exuberant manipulations of all the elements of the book: form and format, layout, script, decoration, illustration, and binding.

Former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned from the post in late July after WikiLeaks published a series of emails suggesting DNC staffers had inappropriately aided eventual presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in her primary battle against U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Ellison has a populist message that can unify Democrats and appeal to Trump voters the party has to win back in future elections, according to Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Brandon Dillon.
"We could play basketball," Drexler, fittingly nicknamed "The Glide," added, "but we also had a degree of showmanship and entertainment."
Democrats in the House of Representatives said they planned to pose a similar request on Thursday to Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady in a bipartisan letter signed by 140 lawmakers, including House Republicans Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Walter Jones of North Carolina.
... civil forfeiture has in recent decades become widespread and highly profitable.... And because the law enforcement entity responsible for seizing the property often keeps it, these entities have strong incentives to pursue forfeiture.... This system—where police can seize property with limited judicial oversight and retain it for their own use—has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses. According to one nationally publicized report, for example, police in the town of Tenaha, Texas, regularly seized the property of out-of-town drivers passing through and collaborated with the district attorney to coerce them into signing waivers of their property rights.... In one case, local officials threatened to file unsubstantiated felony charges against a Latino driver and his girlfriend and to place their children in foster care unless they signed a waiver.... In another, they seized a black plant worker's car and all his property (including cash he planned to use for dental work), jailed him for a night, forced him to sign away his property, and then released him on the side of the road without a phone or money.... He was forced to walk to a Wal-Mart, where he borrowed a stranger's phone to call his mother, who had to rent a car to pick him up. These forfeiture operations frequently target the poor and other groups least able to defend their interests in forfeiture proceedings.... Perversely, these same groups are often the most burdened by forfeiture. They are more likely to use cash than alternative forms of payment, like credit cards, which may be less susceptible to forfeiture. And they are more likely to suffer in their daily lives while they litigate for the return of a critical item of property, such as a car or a home.
2. Dak Prescott, QB, Cowboys
Yet another solid, if unspectacular, game for the seventh-overall pick. So far, DeForest Buckner has been able to affect far more plays than he's finished. His six pressures are all QB hurries, and he only has three run stops, but Buckner is still the highest-graded rookie defensive lineman in the league.
Underlying the collective reluctance of the Nashville faithful toward their team drafting a defenseman this year--even the best defenseman prospect to come along in years--were two notions:
Obviously, the transition in #3 defenseman had much to do with the Preds' decline as one of the league's best puck possession groups. Not surprisingly, the quality of #4 defensemen suffered too:
Josi and Klein have improved greatly. But without a true shutdown defenseman in Hamhuis to anchor the pairing, there was a steep learning curve, and the team suffered their growing pains from 2010-2012. Remember how Poile used to always pledge that the young defenseman would take over, then rush to sign a stopgap veteran? That's how you know things have changed--he's buying out the stop gap veteran this offseason to make room for the teenager.
The permanently shirtless frontman has seemingly failed to see the irony.

This much we know: Kochanski has died (that noise was a million fanboys whooping). Rimmer has aged (a double downer, since holograms aren't meant to). And since Lister left a bath running for nine years, Holly is water-logged and still drying out (so apparently no Norman Lovett or Hattie Hayridge).
“I go on morning walks all the time and I was like, ‘What the heck is that?'” local Tom Beal, 44, told the Sun-Sentinel. “I came over and my girlfriend was with me and we took a picture of it like what is going on here?”
Temple University Board of Trustees Chairman Patrick J. O'Connor announced today that Neil Theobald, senior vice president and chief financial officer at Indiana University, is the sole finalist to become Temple's 10th president. If approved by trustees on Tuesday, Dr. Theobald will assume his new role on Jan. 1, 2013.
Of course, as long as the sequester is in place, any additional investment in high speed rail, no matter how modest and cost effective, is a non-starter. But if Congress and the Administration can finally reach a larger budget agreement, there is hope. Creating a true high speed rail corridor has long been a goal of Democrats and in particular the Obama Administration. And the new Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Bill Shuster, is from Pennsylvania, a state that would greatly benefit from this investment. In addition, if Democrats are willing to open the operation of the rail system to private firms (while maintaining ownership of the infrastructure with Amtrak and the Federal government), enough Republicans, might be swayed to make this smart, cost effective investment.
"We aren't just talking about argument about which side of the river it's going on," said Congressman Mike Bost of Illinois. "We're talking about the long-term security of this facility as well as the overall cost to taxpayers."
Meanwhile, Missouri officials also are encouraging citizens to support the north St. Louis site and submit comments. Congressman William Lacy Clay told supporters in a newsletter this week that they had the power to help finalize the selection of north St. Louis for the NGA.
"Winning the preliminary site selection competition was huge, but I need you to take part in the public comment period which runs through May 2nd," said the Democratic Congressman in his newsletter "Backbone."
The stone was carved during the Qing dynasty from banded jasper. The layers of the stone accumulated naturally over the years, with various shades of hues.[5] The craftsman who carved the stone stained the skin, which resulted in a realistic looking piece of stone with multiple layers appearing like layers of fat and meat.
The Conservative Party of Canada could do something far more constructive for its future prospects than to look to the past for a saviour. The party might accept Harper-era hacks like MacKay or Kellie Leitch as new leadership material, but Canadians never will. Nor will voters buy the proposition put out by Harper loyalists that Harper was just a misunderstood statesman whose tenure will be viewed kindly by history.
It was my great honour to catch up with Sweden's legend Jorgen Persson at the 2017 Liebherr ITTF World Table Tennis Championships in Dusseldorf, Germany. Jorgen has been one of the most prominent players in the sport, helping a powerful Swedish team to reach the top of the world and repel a strong Chinese movement. Hope you enjoy the interview!For more top player interviews visit my Interviews Page. I of course had previously had a chance to win a World championship but lost to Waldner in the 1989 final. Usually you only get one opportunity to achieve these things and when they arise you must take them. I was very disappointed about the 89 final and so when I had another chance in 1991 I went in with confidence as I had been playing well for the whole tournament so I had to take this chance.Roger Federer gentleman and good for sport.JapanesePorsche 911New Zealand or maybe FijiBuy a porsche and go to New Zealand and invest some, be smart ;)
“The only thing that was missing was a camera looking both ways that would be reminiscent of George Orwell's ‘1984,' ” Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said. He acknowledged that federal workers have no right to privacy on government computers or property. “But that is not to say that targeting is appropriate,” he said.
Two early cases of highway robbery in Egham can be seen in the Southwark assize records. On 31st January 1560 William Allen, a yeoman from London, was found guilty of assaulting John Appowell on the highway at Egham on 23rd July 1559. He stole £4 in money, and a gold signet ring. Allen was found guilty, but his sentence was not recorded. Three years later George Vale, a labourer from Southwark, was also convicted after assaulting and robbing John Hooker in the same place on 24th September 1562. His victim was clearly a wealthy man, because Vale relieved him of £26 13 shillings and 4 pence in money, as well as his brown horse, valued at £4. Vale was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging.
On 3rd November 1573 another robbery took place on the highway at Egham, although the case was not brought to trial until 4th October 1575, at Kingston Assizes. Anthony Cooke, a bargeman from Weybridge, was accused of stealing 6 shillings from an unknown man. He had managed to escape arrest, and the case was presented in absentia. He was eventually put on trial for the crime in July 1576 and found not guilty. We may never know whether or not he did steal the money, but it seems likely that the long period of time between the crime taking place and the trial gave him a real advantage, as it would be hard to prove.
The first was on Thursday Sev'nnight last, when two Highwaymen attacked a Lady in her Chariot, on the Road from Egham to Bagshot, and having taken her Watch and Money, were so much in haste for the Earrings, that they either cut them out, or tore them out of her Ears, in a most barbarous manner: The Lady's Servants, that is to say, the Coachman and Foot Boy, driving the Lady immediately to the next Village, threw off the Harness, and mounting the Coach-Horses, pursued the Rogues, and giving Notice at a Turnpike where they expected they might come, and describing them, they were apprehended.'

"We always want to collaborate with the best and most successful filmmakers to grow our franchises and develop our characters. Marvel, Kevin Feige and Amy, who helped orchestrate this deal, are the perfect team to help produce the next chapter of Spider-Man," said Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Michael Lynton. "This is the right decision for the franchise, for our business, for Marvel, and for the fans."
Scherff is the fifth offensive lineman selected in the first round in team history. Sixth if you count TCU's I.B. Hale, a tackle drafted eighth overall in the 1939 NFL Draft.
The whole league saw the culmination of the Dallas Cowboys drafting an offensive lineman in the first round in three of the previous four years. Selecting tackle Tyron Smith (2010 – Ninth overall), center Travis Frederick (2012 – 31st overall) and tackle Zack Martin (2014 – 16th overall) resulted in a career year for running back DeMarco Murray, who rushed for 1,845 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2014.
Democrats and Republicans worked together to to pass this landmark legislation and the $7 million pledged through our petition gave us a seat at the table in Washington to speak on your behalf. We helped each Congressman involved in the process craft legislation that works for entrepreneurs and investors alike. On March 27th, Congress sent the final version of the JOBS Act, which includes the CROWDFUND Act, to President Obama to sign into law.
Blanco said on Sunday that two gang hitmen have admitted killing 17 of the missing students with the help of security officials.

California Assemblyman Marc Berman, a Democrat who was born in Dallas, said, “There comes a time when you have to take a stand on issues.”
One popular way to eliminate the Q&A from the audience is to invite your own moderator to conduct it for you. There's some danger inherent in this approach, though, and it stems mostly from the choice of moderator. It's not hard for a moderator to turn into a pitchman who comes off like a desperate huckster.
The true journalist moderators who are not affiliated with the production tend to ask questions of the same type they would for their news outlet, and the net result can be a fascinating exchange. The best of these by far are Jeff “Doc” Jensen of Entertainment Weekly and Geoff Boucher of the LA Times. Their preparation and professionalism shine, but it is also clear that they are serious fanboys who love nerd culture, and that buys a lot of goodwill with the likeminded mass that make up the audience.
“This collaboration signals a new trend in the Internet age: Strengthening China's traditional industries by leveraging the power of Internet,” Ma's counterpart, Suning Chairman Zhang Jindong added via a statement. “It will also help transform China's manufacturing industry and broaden the global horizons of Chinese brands.”

He is the first prominent American sportsman to harshly criticize President Trump's new immigration policy, which has also been slammed by four-times Olympic champion runner Mo Farah, a British citizen who was born in Somalia and lives in the U.S.
The CRTC is apparently responding to concerns raised by Parliament's standing joint committee for the scrutiny of regulations, which worried that such a sweeping ban may not withstand a court challenge under the Charter of Rights. It seems, however, that the societal benefits of a commitment to truth-telling in broadcasting far outweigh any potential legal potholes emerging with a hypothetical court case in future. As University of Ottawa law professor and media expert Michael Geist points out, there is some irony in the CRTC's timing. Just as the U.S., reeling from the Arizona massacre that targeted Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, is reflecting on the wider social impact of its poisoned airwaves, the CRTC is embracing a more U.S.-style approach. This is made all the more disconcerting as a new right-leaning all-news network, Sun TV News, prepares for its debut in March. In a recent interview, Geist observed there's a growing fear that Canada is about to adopt the more bellicose U.S. approach to political news coverage. The CRTC's proposed change will only deepen these fears.
A Reuters cameraman in the area earlier heard a repeated booming sound and saw plumes of smoke rising from the Syrian side of the border.

Some 28 heads of State sent a motion to the Chairman of the African Union for the immediate suspension of the so-called “Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic,” Hilale said, noting that several countries withdrew their recognition of the so-called SADR.

151st – Dan Girardi's rank among the 152 NHL defensemen who appeared in at least 60 games last year in even-strength relative Corsi percentage (a measure of a player's possession relative to the rest of his teammates). Girardi's been hammered for his awful season so much that it almost feels like we're all picking on him at this point, but yeah… that's not good.
16 – Games in which Brent Burns had seven or more shots on goal last year. That was just one behind the league-leader, Alexander Ovechkin, and miles ahead of the field at this position (no other defenseman had more than five). In fact, you'd have to go back to Ray Bourque two decades ago to find another blue-liner who had more.

In an interview with Time magazine last week, Trump said he has been taking the advice of GOP leaders, including Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, to stay on message.
Both types had their specific advantages and disadvantages: for example, the K bullet was more expensive to produce and therefore was generally only issued to snipers and other advanced marksmen who could use it more effectively; the ordinary infantryman had to make do with reversed bullets, which were far less effective and had to be used in closer proximity to the target. In addition, both types of round damaged the rifles due to the higher propellant load and the resulting higher muzzle velocities and pressures: firstly, service life of the rifle barrel was decreased significantly because of the increased wear. Secondly, the higher pressure created in the chamber could jam the bolt, leading to the extractor claw failing to extract the cartridge and only breaking off the cartridge rim, leaving it stuck in the chamber. The strain of firing the increased charge could also burst the chamber of weaker and older rifles, at best destroying the rifle and at worst injuring or killing the rifleman. For these reasons, the K bullet and reversed bullet were not popular with the troops. Nevertheless, it gave the infantry a chance to stop a tank in an emergency, or at least injure or kill some of the crew if a bullet penetrated.

The only thing anybody can figure is that because Bergstrom was McKenzie's very first draft pick with the Raiders back in 2012, the sentimental value the offensive lineman holds for him pretty much guarantees him a roster spot for life. Sort of like that first dollar bill you made or check you earned that you frame and hang on your wall.
Even Huntsman, who warned against Bain attacks, sent mixed signals. His spokesman, Michael Levoff, walked back his candidate's remarks late in the day: “Governor Huntsman believes Romney has an electability problem regarding his time at Bain, but he does not believe attacking the venture capital business model is productive.”
“You hear this every time,” said South Carolina GOP Chairman Chad Connelly. “ ‘Primaries are a bloodbath.' ‘Primaries are a bare-knuckled fistfight.' I think it's part of the vetting process, the thick-skin-toughening process that's part of the primary.”
Clearly, the states which are bravely moving to defund Planned Parenthood are neither leaving women in the dust nor waging a “war on women.” Instead, Planned Parenthood is the true anti-woman force. It's Planned Parenthood who has cooperated with sex-traffickers, Planned Parenthood who has repeatedly lied to women about fetal development and their own health risks in abortion, Planned Parenthood who has fraudulently claimed taxpayer dollars, and Planned Parenthood who has agreed to target both black and female babies based on characteristics beyond their control.

#4: It was too crowded so my boyfriend and I just played near the swimming pool coping. Suddenly I saw on my boyfriend head some milky fluid, when I touched, it was slippery and a bit thick. I dragged my boyfriend out of the pool immediately and asked him to wash his hair and we went home right after. Those animals masturbated in the swimming pool.
Only a few months ago, the two post-imperial strongmen were exchanging bitterly personal accusations. But this was already the pair's third meeting after a June agreement to normalise ties.
This was one of many major questions about Pederson when he was hired last year. Despite Andy Reid's claims that he called the plays in the second halves of Chiefs games during the 2015 season, Doug didn't have much experience as a play caller. While he had been mentored by a great football mind in Andy Reid, he was inexperienced. That said, I think he exceeded expectations last year. He took his lumps as a play caller, and didn't always lean on the run hard enough, but the Eagles moved the ball pretty well for the most part, despite starting a rookie QB (who only became the starter 10 days before the season) and missing the team's best offensive lineman for a large chunk of the season.
This team went 7-9 last year. That's not a very good record. In a vacuum, a 7-9 record would probably earn Pederson a C or C-. But consider that this is a team that was starting a rookie QB who played his college ball at Division I FCS NDSU. This is a team that has been casting off talent rather than adding it for the last several years, replacing DeSean Jackson, Jeremy Maclin, and LeSean McCoy with the likes of Jordan Matthews, Nelson Agholor, and the oft-injured Ryan Mathews. This is a team whose best offensive lineman was suspended for 10 games and whose starting cornerbacks were Nolan Carroll and the corpse of Leodis McKelvin. This is a team that got screwed by a quirky schedule, getting an early bye week in Week 4 and also having to play three teams coming off of their byes later in the season, two of whom were division opponents. There are no excuses for losing in the NFL, but considering all of these circumstances, the fact that Pederson was able to guide this team to 7 wins is kind of extraordinary. Grade: B-
“As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) said Wednesday.
The bill, from Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Iran hawk Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), is intended to address issues they see in the nuclear deal itself, according to a fact sheet from Corker's office.
So desperate was Abbott to prove his everyman credentials that he went in like a bull at a gate, determined to seize and eat anything put in front of him, and ended up biting into a whole raw onion like some kind of rookie pod person.

In the middle of the first period, Backstrom began his reign of terror, tying the game at one with some nifty passing from teammates Alex Ovechkin and Richard Gynge. Former Capital and Hershey Bears defenseman Brian “Mr. Excitement” Fahey put Vityaz back on top, scoring on the power play with a two-man advantage. Five minutes into the second period, Anton Korolev made the score 3-1. Vityaz took a two-goal lead into the second intermission.
One case in particular involved Ben Radford, a prominent skeptical writer. He was accused of “stalking, sexual harassment, and both physical and sexual assault” by his former girlfriend Karen Stollznow (a prominent skeptic in her own right).

Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and William Nylander are big offensive upgrades while Zach Hyman, Connor Brown and defenceman Connor Carrick have helped around the margins.
Ok, i LOVE the design details in science fiction. This morning i was so half awake, i started things off catching up on the new Syfy show Warehouse 13 to ease into things… and couldn't help but fixate on the STEAMPUNK WACOM TABLET! I mean i love all the bizarre archaic gadgetry (Wired has a nice look at them)… but its the tablet and keyboard that got me first. Also… i love how small the internet is, while looking up past steampunk keyboard, found out that the keyboard was made by Datamancer - “prestidigital datamancery & paraphrenalic technofetishism” ~ and the exact keyboard in the show is “the Sojourner keyboard I built for my girlfriend 2 Christmases ago” - and he “hope[s] the show becomes very popular so they commission me to build them some more elaborate contraptions for future seasons (I'm actually designing a Version 2.0 of my old Computational Engine PC right now with them in mind)”… So fun to hear how these shows pull in awesome design for even the tiniest details… see more pics on the next page!

The key thing to know is that the rhetoric around tax reform is very different from health care. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady have both said they are committed to maintaining "revenue neutrality" — that is, they don't want changes in the tax code to result in a change in government revenue. That would have been a lot easier to do if they were trying to hit a revenue goal of $40 trillion instead of $41 trillion.
But, as Marion Maddox points out in an important article in the academic journal Political Theology, many key ACL personnel have connections with political parties of the right: managing director Lyle Shelton stood for the Nationals in the Queensland state election of 2006; ACL co founder John Gagliardi worked as an advisor to Liberal prime minister John Gorton; ACL Chairman Emeritus Tony McLellan helps direct the Liberal party's Menzies Research Institute.
As you get better at it, you start to gain a better understanding of why you do the things you do. This is quite valuable. In writing (and incidentally, in sex) you never get very far if you simply let your initial impulses and assumptions control you…if you don't think about other people, and what they want, and why they want what they want. You end up being that kid that doesn't eat vegetables, that boyfriend that doesn't perform well in bed, or that author that just writes crappy knock-offs of other people's stuff. I'd like to think that studying philosophy…or anything really….helps a person examine their life, and in the process be a better person. It has absolutely no utility in “winning” arguments, proving how smart you are, getting a job, or making money…but it does, I think, make you better at being a person, and a friend to other people.
The change of venues from windy Hambantota to humid Colombo may not change the fortunes of Rohit Sharma and Manoj Tiwary. The team management expects much of Rohit in the 2015 World Cup and will back him "as much as possible", according to opening batsman Gautam Gambhir. Tiwary is sure to get opportunities, but whether it comes in the next game or the next series, "no one knows," Gambhir said. So basically, Rohit has the faith; Tiwary can keep the bench.

It was only a matter of time before someone came up with this hack. Instead of dropping an arm and a leg on some high-falutin' Simmons rig, you can now utilize your Rock Band drum kit to bone up on your "In the Air Tonight" fills. A gentleman named Andrew Rudson has taken the kit out of the game, turned it into a proper instrument, and is calling it Drum Machine. Using a "hack" to get the set playing nice with Windows, Andrew has augmented the experience by creating a drum "brain" that lets you assign sounds to the pads, a slick 3D interface which allows you to watch an on-screen representation of your kit in action, and a record / playback component so that you can review and / or show off your killer performances. Check the video after the break to see what we mean, and then hit up Andrew's site for the software.[Thanks, Graham]

Management (B) – The patient, conservative approach of general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff isn't for everyone, but it's finally yielding some results. The addition of versatile forward Mathieu Perreault in free agency was one of the best bargains of the summer, while bringing in veteran defenceman Jay Harrison to help stop the bleeding when the injuries hit came at little cost. Cheveldayoff also left some room for his developing players (like Adam Lowry) to force their way onto the roster with a strong training camp. But now that the Jets are in contention, can Cheveldayoff find a depth forward or two to bolster the bottom-six without sacrificing too much? And will he get Frolik signed to an extension before losing him as an unrestricted free agent? If the answer is yes on both fronts, Cheveldayoff's grade will improve further.

My girlfriend and I picked up "Clive" on Craigslist for $750. A few quick specs:
Thanks for checking out the project! I'll keep you guys posted as we move along. Hello! Wanted to introduce everyone to our project.(Scroll down for pics)My girlfriend and I picked up "Clive" on Craigslist for $750. A few quick specs:-1977 Brave D26RT (26' Length)-Mopar 440 V8 (built and modified)-Dodge M400 chassisWhen we bought him, the owner said the only time it had run in the past 12 years was a 3 mile drive 5 years ago. After many attempts, he finally sputtered to life, and I drove him several laps around the seller's barn to try and shake the cobwebbs out before the 45 minute trek to my shop. He made it, and I got to work. I only had two months before I needed to drive this old dog from Minneapolis, MN to Tampa, FL for a new job at a large RV dealership.Clive was everything you'd expect from a $750 RV from the 70s. The roof was shot, with water pouring down from a sagging AC. The orange shag carpet was heavy with dirt and debris. There was evidence of rot and water damage in every corner, along with garbage left from previous owners.As we got him:First step was to remove the roof. I had seen many projects where people spent weeks peeling off old sealer and carefully resealing everything. I didn't have that kind of time. But I had power tools. And an overhead chain hoist. Time to rip that leaky tin off.Now that we could see, we got to work gutting the interior. Nearly everything was torn out and all original holes and wall damage was filled and sanded.Once everything was smooth, painting began. We also replaced remaining cabinet hardware and hinges.And then there was the ugly cab area...A wiring nightmare, orange shag carpet, and surface rust stood in my way.Now that the shag is gone, time for fake hardwood flooring. Lock together style.We replaced the dinette with a nice little retro couch in front of some wainscoting.Repaired the cracked dog house, added dynamat, and prepped the cab area for finishingLittle side note--all the metal trim, seat bases, and cabinet hardware are sprayed with the same nickel finishOrganized all the loose wiring and made kickpanels for under the dash. Carefully cut an opening in the vinyl dash (sorry guys!) for my Motorola Xoom tablet which feeds in to the audio system. Eventually will run lighting as well.As we got close to our departure date, it was time to build the new roof. 2x4's were cut to length, then cut on a bandsaw so they form a shallow arch. The roof was assembled and sealed with a roll on rubber product designed for mobile home roofs.We loaded up, and took off for Florida.Just east of New Orleans, the tired old 440 had enough. From what I assume, the old dry cracked rear main seal failed and I lost all my oil along I-10, leading to a snapped rod in cylinder 1. We left him in a truck stop parking lot and went back for him the following weekend, bringing him the rest of the way back to Florida on a gooseneck (watch out for bridges!)Got him to our new family shop in Florida and ripped the engine out.Once to Florida, I sourced a rebuilt and spiced up 440 that a guy was going to use in a hot rod project. Still has the RV cam. Went hunting on ebay and really got the new powerplant looking nice. Estimating around 350-375HP.With the engine out, I took the time to clean up years of oil blow by and grease on the frame rails.And this is how Clive sits now. I hope to have the engine back in within a couple weeks, and then focus will be on exterior restoration with some modification (I work in the body shop of a busy RV dealer).Thanks for checking out the project! I'll keep you guys posted as we move along.

Most woodsmen and women are familiar with the age-old adage: Leave No Trace. The phrase means that while we are enjoying the beauty of the wilderness, we should make as small of an impact on the ecosystems we are traversing as possible. Ideally, there should be, literally, no trace you have been in the woods – other than the beautiful Instagram photo you will post when you return to society. However, not all outdoorsmen adhere to this philosophy and trash in wilderness areas is a huge problem.
If the Edmonton Oilers were thinking of buying out Andrew Ference with the two-week window starting Wednesday, it's a non-starter because the 37-year-old defenceman hasn't been cleared medically after hip surgery in early March.
On his @fernuckle twitter page, it was noted that Ference, who played just six games last season as an eighth defenceman on the roster, had cycled 70 km a few days ago, but there's a difference between riding a bike on the road and being medically green-lighted to play, said his agent Kurt Overhardt.
Ference has played a hard-pounding 907 NHL league games and another 120 in the playoffs, including a Cup ring in Boston in 2011. As the 208th player taken in the 1997 draft after playing for the Portland Winterhawks, the defenceman long ago exceeded everybody's expectations, and his body looked worn out last season.
ON THE BENCH — Oilers amateur scout Kelly Buchberger, who was on Craig MacTavish's coaching staff for years, remains a candidate for the Kelowna Rockets junior job. With ex Dallas Stars defenceman Richard Matvichuk getting the Prince George Cougars gig and former NHL assistants Tim Hunter (Moose Jaw) and Mark Lamb (Swift Current) in the league, Buchberger could well wind up in Kelowna … Lest we forget, Connor McDavid will be in Vegas for the NHL awards show June 22 to try and become the first Oiler to win rookie of the year. Chicago winger Artemi Panarin, McDavid and Philly defenceman Shayne Gostisbehere are the three finalists with Panarin and McDavid battling it out for the Calder … The Oilers fall exhibition schedule is out and here are the home games at Rogers Place: Sept. 26 split-squad vs Calgary, Oct. 4 (Anaheim), Oct. 6 (Winnipeg), Oct. 8 (Vancouver). They'll have a split-squad game vs the Flames at the Saddledome Sept. 26, and road games in Vancouver (Sept. 28), Winnipeg (Sept 30) and Lumby, B.C. against Los Angeles Kings as Kraft Hockeyville on Oct. 2. With the World Cup and exhibitions not ending until Oct. 8, it's expected the regular-season won't start until Oct. 13 at the earliest … No surprise Oilers didn't sign junior goalie Keven Bouchard, their last pick in 2013. He goes back into the draft pool in Buffalo. Bouchard played better (2.79 avg, .909 save percentage) in 17 playoff games for Moncton this spring than his regular season but he didn't progress enough … Swedish goalie Niklas Lundstrom, a farm-team disappointment after they got him from the Blues in the Anders Nilsson deal, has signed with a lower-rung Swedish team.
In this case, the role player and instigator of note are Green and career journeyman Dahntay Jones.

There has been a great back-and-forth as to who the best defenseman is in the upcoming NHL Draft. What started as a group being led by the possible first overall selection in Timothy Liljegren, has turned into a debate with no number one contender completely ahead of all the rest involving Miro Heiskanen, Cale Makar, Liljegren and Juuso Valimaki.
Evaluating the Top Defensemen in the 2017 NHL Draft
There are some quality defensemen available at top of the 2017 NHL Draft. Through the first 15 selections, there could be as many as four defensemen taken. Miro Heiskanen, Cale Makar, Timothy Liljegren, and Juuso Valimaki are touted as the best defenseman available in the draft. After those four have been taken, the defensive crop takes a hit in terms of the quality available.
While the order of these four defensemen has been argued and still is, the general consensus forming. It seems that there are two defensemen that clearly stand out and the other two lack some defensive capabilities, holding them behind.
One thing is certain: Timothy Liljegren is not the best defenseman in this draft. That title now appears to belong to Miro Heiskanen. His season with HIFK proved that he is a top-tier two-way defenseman that should go very high in this upcoming draft. His performance at the 2017 U18 World Championship, which was amongst the best of any defenseman to play in the tournament, only certified his skill.
Heiskanen finished the tournament with two goals and ten assists in his seven games with Team Finland. Those 12 points were tied for the second most all-time amongst defensemen in one tournament. He is now tied with Matt Dumba and one point shy of Ryan Murphy. 10 assists also ranks second all-time in assists in one tournament.
The next defenseman to challenge Heiskanen, in my eyes, is Cale Makar. His offensive skills and output in the AJHL make him a top prospect as is. His transition game buffaloed the opposition all season long with the Brooks Bandits and he held up his own end in the defensive zone.
His skating is arguably the best out of any defenseman and is even the whole draft. His head is up and his vision allows him to make the best decisions when entering the offensive zone. That has led to fantastic offensive production and great success to the Brooks Bandits.
After a tremendous and offensively strong season with the Tri-City Americans, Juuso Valimaki has flown up draft boards everywhere. His skating, strong puck possession and playmaking have turned him into a standout defenseman available in what is looking to be the top 15 selections in the upcoming NHL Draft.
Valimaki's passing and distribution skills have made him the gifted defenseman that he is. Not only is he able to find teammates with ease on the man advantage, but he can keep the puck moving at 5-on-5.
The first half of the 2017 NHL Draft will contain some decent prospects and we could possibly see these four defensemen gone by then. Whichever team selects them will be adding a terrific two-way defenceman to their pipeline.

In 1907, Michelin launched a travel magazine in Italy, giving Bibendum a regular column. In one, he wrote of a Ball of Nations he had attended, praising ladies representing various lands. According to biographer Darman's translation, Bibendum addressed Italy: "O you sublime Madonna, Rome's destiny, accept my homage, you whose eyes shine with the splendors of the Renaissance." In an almost cruel postscript, Bibendum reported the crushing impact his social conquests were having on his rivals: "ashen-faced suitors with fixed smiles, living symbols of a shattered illusion."

Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27-year-old public radio journalist in Seattle with girlfriend and artist Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) of whom best friend and co-worker Kyle (Seth Rogen) disapproves. While Kyle is brash and outspoken, Adam is more introverted and mild-mannered.
After Mitch dies, Adam's fear of his potential death and future surface as he is subsequently informed that he needs to undergo surgery. The night before, Adam argues with an intoxicated Kyle, demanding that he drive even though he cannot. After a near miss, Adam breaks down and berates Kyle for seemingly not taking him seriously and using it for his own gain. Adam calls Katherine and tells her that he wishes he had a girlfriend like her, but also says he is tired and just wants it to be over. That night, Adam stays at Kyle's and finds a book entitled 'Facing Cancer Together' from their first trip to a bookstore where Kyle picked up the shop clerk—filled with notes, highlighted paragraphs and turned-down pages, proving that Kyle sincerely cares and has been simply continuing to treat Adam the same since his diagnosis.

It all started when the sister of Machado's boyfriend at the time, Juan Rodriguez Reggeti, committed suicide. Reggeti reportedly blamed his brother-in-law Francisco Sbert Moukso for driving the woman to her death, and brooded over how to enact his revenge, authorities in Caracas said. Then, at his sister's funeral, gunfire was unleashed and his brother-in-law was shot twice outside the El Cafetal church in Caracas.

SC : I wasn't aware of that stat, but he's definitely their best player so having him in the lineup is a huge addition. He's one of the top defenseman in the league right now, and he can log a lot of minutes against the other team's top line which makes a huge difference. This is especially important in a league like the OHL, where your top guys will often push 30 minutes a night if they're defenseman, sometimes even more,so having him on the ice instead of some of their more inexperienced guys adds some stability to the back-end.
SC : I like his game a lot and I've always been a big proponent of his, but I'm not sure he's going to live up to hype that most fans associate with the third overall billing. I think it's difficult for defensive defenseman or two way defensemen to prove their worth to the fans when you could have guys like Hall, Seguin, Skinner etc. putting up 80 point seasons. With that being said, if Gudbranson develops into a guy that can pot 30-35 points a year, play on the top pairing and wear the 'C', I think that certainly warrants the third overall pick, especially in the mind of the general manager and coaching staff that loves to have guys like that in the lineup.
Last month, Congressman Justin Amash sounded the alarm on controversial spying language that was snuck into a 2,009-page omnibus bill. The massive budget legislation was, as is typical in Washington, haphazardly passed to avoid an end-of-year government shutdown.
Amash's bill is bipartisan, and is co-sponsored by Congressman John Conyers (D-Mich.), Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Congressman Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Congressman Ted Poe (R-Texas), and Congressman Jared Polis (D-Colo.).
The Saints plucked Brooks from the Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders -- the same place they found defensive lineman Tom Johnson three years ago. The speedy 5-foot-10, 195-pounder, who played in college at Western Kentucky, had five interceptions over the past two years for Calgary.

Actress Patricia Heaton took no crap on "Everybody Loves Raymond." As it turns out, she has no patience for nonsense off the small screen as well. Like many of us, she has witnessed the ongoing battle between CNN and President Trump over the president's WWE tweet, which was created by a Reddit user. It was clearly a joke, yet the network took it as a threat, releasing a statement condemning the president for inciting violence.
The Banner Saga, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, Lumino City, Titanfall and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter all receive three nominations each, whilst Disney Fantasia: Music Evolved, Forza Horizon 2, Hitman GO, The Last of Us: Left Behind, Minecraft: Console Editions, Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna), The Sailor's Dream, Threes, Valiant Hearts, The Walking Dead: Season 2 and The Wolf Among Us all have two nominations each.

In lieu of the reform bill, McConnell has co-authored a bill with Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) that would reauthorize current bulk surveillance programs for five additional years without any reforms, and he has made preparations to bring that bill to a floor vote without committee consideration. Congressional opponents of the NSA's practices have said they fear McConnell's moves are calibrated to force Congress to act shortly before the deadline with limited time to debate new constraints.

As we've previously reported, both Univision and the Clinton campaign established a working relationship at the urging of Executive Chairman and Clinton megadonor Haim Saban. As a result of that working relationship, the network's TV news division has self-suppressed its reporting on scandals pertaining to the Clinton Foundation or the reopened email scandal, time and time and time and time and time again. Jorge Ramos, the very vocal and public face of the TV news division, has yet to pen even the first opinion column addressing this glaring example of the "corruption and public lies" that he so zealously purports to stand up to.
The ugly, painful, and proven fact is that Univision's TV news division has devolved into a de facto political communications operation - and it is proven beyond all reasonable doubt that this devolution occurred while under the oversight of both Executive Chairman Haim Saban and Chief News/Entertainment/Digital Officer Isaac Lee. But this Category-5 political hurricane provides Univision with an incredibly unique opportunity - just days out from the 2016 general election - to recast, reset, and refocus its news operation so that it can rededicate itself to the practice of actual journalism instead of political propaganda.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, sent a letter to the Inspector General on Wednesday requesting an investigation into the intelligence leaks that led to the resignation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

What happened to Egypt's young liberals? Five years ago, they were the most promising movement in an Arab world dominated by strongmen like Mubarak. Now the vast majority of them are cheering another general, coup leader Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, whose beribboned image is appearing on posters around Cairo in tandem with those of former military dictators Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat.

Fenerty was born in Upper Falmouth, Nova Scotia.[6] He was the youngest of three boys, all of whom worked for their father, a lumberman and farmer. During the winter months, the Fenertys would clear-cut the local forests for lumber, which they then transported to the family's lumber mill at Springfield Lake. The Fenertys shipped their lumber to the Halifax dockyards, where it was exported or used locally.[7] The Fenertys had around 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of farmland; they shipped most of their produce to the markets in Halifax.

Posh diners are swallowing up yet another species from the ocean: the European seabass. The population of the once populous fish has plummeted 32% since 2009 and has hit a 20-year low, according to the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), a European science council. The group says fishermen from the UK, Channel Islands, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark and France should slash their combined catches of seabass by 36%.
That huge premium probably has less to do with the Nigella and Gordon effect than the fact that wild fish are getting scarcer, fast. EU fishermen only caught 4,060 tonnes (4,475 tons) last year, down from the peak of 4,758 tonnes in 2010, and a fairly steady decline since 2006, when fishermen landed 4,522 tonnes.
ICES is asking EU fishermen to catch only 2,070 tonnes in the next year to help revive the seabass stock. That already isn't sitting well with EU fishermen. “A cut of 36% would decimate us, I'm only catching around five fish a day and going down to two or three would put me out of business,” Andy Alcock, secretary of a British fishermen's guild, told the Dorset Echo.

I write under my real name most of the time. I use pseudonyms occasionally, such as when I write satire or sarcasm that I would rather not be associated with my "serious" byline. But I use "JC Garrett" when I write articles, while I use "Chris Garrett" when writing to my Congressman, Senators and most other government officials. Both are my real name, but I would rather not make it easy for a simple computer search by a staffer to find out exactly what kind of trouble that dissident, Chris Garrett, has been stirring up. It helps ensure that "Chris Garrett" doesn't get blacklisted from congressional e-mail lists. And since my Congressman was a prominent judge before my mentally-challenged neighbors foolishly elected him to represent them in Washington, it provides a slight buffer to the harassment and vindictive abuses of power in which those in high positions so frequently engage. He's got buddies in the sheriff's office who would be glad to oblige a request to make someone's life a little less pleasant.
Finally, they could include a lower-level prospect like Jose Marmolejos. I say “lower-level” because he is consistently ranked at #10 or below in their system as a first baseman and that's not necessarily promising in his age-24 season. However, he is the Nats' reigning minor league player of the year (for both 2015 and 2016) and Nationals director of player development, Mark Scialabba, raved about him in May:
Lance Corporal Brynin was a star, burning bright and rising fast. From the moment he joined the Brigade Reconnaissance Force it was clear that we were blessed with a truly special individual. His loss is one of the real tragedies of this military campaign. He stood out due to his professionalism, his determination and his razor-sharp intelligence. He touched everyone with his zest for life and sense of humour. But above all he will be remembered for his extraordinary courage: when it mattered he stood up and was counted. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his girlfriend Olivia.
Jay was one of the best friends I've had in my Army career. I first met him while trying to dodge a Pathfinders cadre in order to go to a stag do. Whilst it looked like I would miss the stag do as nobody wanted to be thrashed by Pathfinders in Brecon, one word to Jay, whom I barely knew at the time, and he jumped at the chance. I've met precious few people who I've instantly bonded with like Jay. We shared a passion for all things with 4 wheels and spent many an hour debating our favourites. I couldn't possibly describe Jay without using the word ‘keen'. His enthusiasm was intoxicating. He loved almost all aspects of Army life. In particular, sport, green skills, his job as an analyst, but, most of all, gossip and ‘shimfing'. He was probably the only person who took it personally when an operation was cancelled. His enthusiasm also continued to nights out with the boys where he was always good for a laugh. Jay always seemed to throw himself into whatever he did, whether it was football, weightlifting or his Army career. He was always his own man, rarely backing down in debates. He maintained his strong personality and individuality. My heart goes out to his family and long term girlfriend Olivia, all of whom he spoke of so fondly. I will miss him dearly.
The 29-second-long commercial features an adult Chinese daughter having dinner at home with her two parents whose disapproval of their daughter's lack of marriage prospects brighten immediately when she unexpectedly produces a boyfriend from out of nowhere.
However, the part of the commercial that has inflamed public outrage is the line of dialog that sets up its premise. Right at the beginning, the mother puts down her chopsticks loudly and complains to her daughter: "If you don't bring a boyfriend home, don't consider me to be your mother anymore."
"Not bringing a boyfriend home will result in a mean face and no festive atmosphere, but doing so will result in smiles and welcomes. How is this a family?" read the complaint.
Odom could never hurt anybody besides himself.

Odom covered his mouth. “Do you want to be on the show?” he whispered. “Okay,” I replied. “Are you sure?” he asked. Leave it to Lamar Odom to ask the follow-up question that everybody should have been posing to him.

For his part, Colorado Republican Party Chairman Steve House downplays the significance of nixing the straw poll. He describes previous ones merely as “media events.” In 2008, for example, Mitt Romney won it in Colorado, while John McCain went on to become the nominee. And in 2012 Rick Santorum won in Colorado, and, like Romney, didn't get the nomination.
“They will be talking about the Republican candidates for president. They just won't be taking a preference poll,” says Colorado GOP Chairman Steve House.
Sedgwick County Republican Party Chairwoman Claudine Kappius says she hates the presidential straw poll, so she's fine with not having one this time around. “I think it's the worst thing that anybody ever tried to do,” she says. She clarified that she meant the poll just didn't have much value to her. The GOP candidates whom Colorado caucus-goers chose in recent elections, she said, didn't become the nominee.
Bono was defeated in her bid for reelection in 2012 by Dr. Raul Ruiz. She was, at the time, the sole female Republican in California's congressional delegation, and until Congresswoman Mimi Walters was elected in November 2014, no other female Republican was part of the delegation.
In 2001, she married Wyoming businessman Glenn Baxley about 18 months after they met in Mexico. They filed for divorce in 2005.[38] On December 15, 2007, Bono married Congressman Connie Mack IV (R-FL) in Asheville, North Carolina.[39] In May 2013, the couple announced they had separated on amicable terms and divorced later that month.[40]

the boyish rapt confusion
He was also very popular with his Board of Trustees. A museum director is in a kind of sandwich between his staff who work under him, and the trustees who are over him. Even though they are not paid and not involved with the day-to-day operations of the museum, they are essentially the boss of the boss. That's where things got tricky. It became a matter for the trustees to deal with. And my father had a serious adversary in the Chairman of the Board, George Seybolt, who was a gruff business type who very aggressively moved in and tried to institute major changes. He was shaking things up quite a bit and really wanted to take control away from my father. They didn't see eye to eye and I think—and many people think—he was quite anxious to see my father go. So he turned the Raphael incident into a cut-and-dried reason to ask for my father's resignation.
In light of pending litigation, I have been reluctant to issue any public statements. However, because of apparent confusion concerning Joe Nacchio and his role in refusing to make private telephone records of Qwest customers available to the NSA immediately following the Patriot Act, and in order to negate misguided attempts to relate Mr. Nacchio's conduct to present litigation, the following are the facts. In the Fall of 2001, at a time when there was no investigation of Qwest or Mr. Nacchio by the Department of Justice or the Securities and Exchange Commission, and while Mr. Nacchio was Chairman and CEO of Qwest and was serving pursuant to the President's appointment as the Chairman of the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, Qwest was approached to permit the Government access to the private telephone records of Qwest customers. Mr. Nacchio made inquiry as to whether a warrant or other legal process had been secured in support of that request. When he learned that no such authority had been granted and that there was a disinclination on the part of the authorities to use any legal process, including the Special Court which had been established to handle such matters, Mr. Nacchio concluded that these requests violated the privacy requirements of the Telecommunications Act. Accordingly, Mr. Nacchio issued instructions to refuse to comply with these requests. These requests continued throughout Mr. Nacchio's tenure and until his departure in June of 2002.
"The gentleman ... has apparently gone to his country's interests section because he is unhappy with how much time it has taken to facilitate his departure," Sullivan wrote. "This could lead to problematic news stories in the next 24 hours.”
Junior | Defensive lineman
Oklahoma State Cowboys
The Big 12's breakout star in 2014 burst onto the national scene with a pair of sacks against Florida State's Jameis Winston in the season opener. He went on to earn Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year honors with 11 sacks and 17 tackles for loss as a sophomore. Ogbah will be the centerpiece of a defense that could be OSU's best under Mike Gundy.
Justin Pugh (+1.4) - We have our THIRD offensive lineman in the "Kudos" section (stealing from Ed!) as Pugh graded positively in run blocking and pass protection. Unfortunately, a -0.7 grade in "penalty" marked down his score and it was for a penalty that was questionable at best.
J.D. Walton (-2.5) - Three offensive linemen make it to the positive grading section, but this is the New York Giants we're talking about here. We'd be remiss if we left any offensive lineman in the negative section. Walton has been getting bullied on quite a few snaps and consistently pushed back in the pocket. The Giants have to hope he improves, and fast, because if not, they are in trouble. This is his second negatively ranked game in a row, though surprisingly enough, he isn't the worst center thus far. Some notable names such as Tampa Bay Buccaneer Evan Dietrich-Smith and Dallas Cowboy Travis Frederick have been worse.
Cullen Jenkins (+1.8) - It appears both lines dominated this game as Jenkins becomes the third defensive lineman with a positive grade. He was strong pass rusher, notching a QB hurry and didn't really mess up against the run.
Thomas was remembered for his skills on offense and defense and for his grace under pressure. In a letter to the student newspaper on May 27, 1905, one alumnus who had attended a game against Ohio University wrote that “the only unpleasant feature of the game was the coarse slurs cast at Mr. Thomas, the catcher.” The letter continued, “But through it all, he showed himself far more the gentleman than his insolent tormentors though their skin is white.”
Added defensive lineman Corey Liuget: "We're just full of energy. We play for each other. We play the game the right way. And at the end of the day, we know that we're all competing for the team to get better, and for each and every one of us to get better, too."
They include defensive linemen Liuget (first round, 2011 draft) and Kendall Reyes (second round, 2012); outside linebackers Ingram (first round, 2012) and Jeremiah Attaochu (second round, 2014); inside linebackers Donald Butler (third round, 2010) and Te'o (second round, 2013); and cornerback Jason Verrett (first round, 2014).

That started from the very beginning as FSU shortstop Taylor Walls led off the game with a walk before third baseman Dylan Busby destroyed a ball to straightaway center for a two-run home run.
But, the idea that you should turn to your phone whenever you feel unhappy or bored is not exactly the kind of lesson you want to teach her; you want her to grow up to be able to entertain herself, absent a technological device. So you think about busting out some pen and paper games like hangman or tic-tac-toe, but she's preliterate and only understands strategy in terms of figuring out how to poop so no one sees her.

Then, last but not least I decided to have royal purple to be my bold color for the night. The bridesmaids will wear this color, and the groomsmen will wear royal purple ties. It's perfect for a end of summer, start of fall wedding that's elegant. All the colors work very well together, and this is a nice accent addition to the day. It gives me the opportunity to have a bold pop of color.

The Wild must limit turnovers at both blue lines, get pucks deep and put the Avalanche's young and inexperienced defensemen in, as Parise said, “uncomfortable spots.”
Judging by Colorado's lineup in at least Tuesday's practice, seven forwards and five defensemen might make their playoff debuts Thursday night.
“Whenever you do something, the more you do it, the more comfortable you feel, just like driving your car or riding a bike,” said Wild defenseman Ryan Suter, who has played 44 playoff games. “The more you do it, the better you get at it.”

Britain's biggest landlord, Fergus Wilson has banned “battered wives” from his properties claiming he does not want to risk ex-husbands or boyfriends returning to destroy his houses. Perhaps Britain's most notorious buy-to-let landlord, Wilson is no stranger to controversy. In 2014 he sent eviction notices to over 200 of his tenants, many from low income backgrounds, claiming that he was “sending battered wives back to their partners to be beaten up again”. He was also convicted in the same year for assaulting an estate agent over a broken boiler which he denied, claiming that he was “too fat to punch anybody or even tie his own shoelaces”. Read more

Tell us about “Puebla mi Amor,” the soap opera embedded within the film. Why is that in there? Initially, I was thinking of just licensing a telenovela for this film, and then I realized that if I shot my own, I would have more control as to what the characters did and said, and how directly they could impact my characters in the actual film. I wanted to show these parallels between what we watch and how they sometimes influence our lives. “Puebla mi Amor” is a completely fictitious telenovela I created just out of knowing how much telenovela culture really has played an impact on Ghanaian ideology — ideas of love, ideas of family. I think we're really fascinated by foreign culture as Ghanaians. We're constantly absorbing it and inevitably it influences us. I initially was planning to shoot the telenovela in Miami, which is where most telenovelas are shot, but I just couldn't afford it on our micro budget. And so I ended up casting everybody in Ghana, and pretty much faking Miami, faking Mexico, in Accra with some expats living here. It was really exciting to create that world right here, and show that it's all fluid — that we live in a polycultural society and nothing is an island and everything's borrowed from the next. I can't wait for people to fall in love with those characters as well. Blitz the Ambassador on the set of The Burial of Kojo in Western Region of Ghana with local crew members. Photo: Ofoe Amegavie. What does it mean to you to have produced and filmed a feature film in you home country? It's huge. I daresay that this is the first non-foreign film of this magnitude and scale to be produced in Ghana. I'm pretty certain of that. We're burning cars, digging mine shafts and doing crazy stuff that's mostly done when big-budget Hollywood films are shot here. Recently Beasts of No Nation was shot here for Netflix, but those are operations that pretty much move in and move out. They literally bring everything and take everything out, from manpower to equipment to staff to crew. Before this project even began, I launched the Africa Film Society here in Ghana, and we created a film screening called Classics in the Park, which has grown considerably. The idea was to reboot cinema. We've had cinema culture in Ghana for several years, but it's been dormant for a while. And so for me, this film was an opportunity to not just create a film, but to create the environment, and help inspire the audience and rekindle that love for cinema. Because you can't make a film that ends up playing all over the world but never at home, which is mostly what happens. “Cinema isn't just a form of entertainment. It's something that I truly believe helps one see oneself in the world.” The other thing that's exciting about this film is infrastructure: being able to build a network of competent crew. This is something that will benefit not just my films, but other productions that will come to Ghana — and other productions will be started by Ghanaians here. You'll have a cadre of well-trained and very inspired crew and cast. For me, cinema isn't just a form of entertainment. It's something that I truly believe helps one see oneself in the world. It helps you see a reflection of yourself in the narratives, and feel a part of a global narrative. For a long time, African filmmakers and African narrators did not have that opportunity. The rest of the world has very little knowledge, understanding, or appreciation of African stories by African filmmakers. I hope this film can set a precedent that films can be made on a low budget, can be shot on location, authentically, by directors who are familiar with the local environment. They don't have to be foreign productions that come to tell the story. When that happens, the story is often told wrong. It will enable us as Ghanaians, as Africans, to understand ourselves better — and hopefully the world will too. Support The Burial of Kojo on Kickstarter now!
Meaning, the slave would not be in breach of a contract by refusing to obey an illegal order. In constitutional law, it is lawful for military servicemen to disobey illegal orders given by superior officers. In BDSM, slavery contracts often come with licit clauses codifying stipulations, specifically that Master can order the slave to do anything, except where the latter would be in conflict with the law.

Alpha Centauri is hands down my favourite 4X game of all time, and it's almost entirely down to its characters and story. The idea to split humanity on ideological rather than national boundaries was a great one, but it's what happened next that marks AC's true genius - the human faces put onto them to make them more than simply a philosophy, mixed with a game that made you feel you were seeing the expression of it. Regardless of the numbers and what specific tactics the AI was using, fighting the Hive felt different to fighting the Gaians; the accumulated weight of the Morganite philosophies and their financial empire making allying with them a very different matter to, say, Chairman Yang, who would turtle up in his bases. It was a personal experience, helped by a thousand tiny little touches like the insults the faction leaders would sling at each other ("Lady Deidre dancing naked through the trees" and so on) that made it feel like they were engaged in the struggle instead of simply controlling their part, and the beautifully written slivers of philosophy that sat effortlessly next to words taken from some of the greatest minds in history.
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said he was not surprised at the challenge. "We are confident that the full court will agree with the panel's affirmation of the FCC's clear authority to enact its strong Open Internet rules, the reasoned decision-making upon which they are based, and the adequacy of the record from which they were developed,” he said in a statement.
In the final minute of last Saturday's UEFA Champions League final between Juventus and Barcelona, the Italian giants introduced 18-year-old Frenchman Kingsley Coman to give the teenager a taste of his first major cup final.
During the Cold War the West became a symbol of freedom, the East a byword for repression. While US servicemen had the run of West Germany in whatever glitzy automotive product out of Detroit took their fancy, the delights of personal mobility in the East took the form of the Trabant, commonly nicknamed “Trabbi”. It was cheap to build and run, but invariably only available to favoured Party members rather than the populace at large.
The fighting around Tal Tamr has coincided with heavy clashes between Kurdish militiamen and ISIS militants about 90 kilometres to the east near the Iraqi border. Kurdish fighters from the People's Protection Units, or YPG, launched an offensive over the weekend, quickly seizing some 20 villages from the extremists.

For hundreds of years, non-Muslim draftsmen and laborers had work along side the Ottoman Army peaceably. Apart from serving in different spheres of the Ottoman state system, Armenians also held high positions at the Military (War) and Navy ministries. When the war started in August 1914, 60,000 Armenian men joined those already serving in the Ottoman army. In January 1915, the Ottoman Army suffered a large defeat by Russian forces at Sarikamish. Enver Pasha, the Minister of War and the actual leader of the Ottoman Empire, feels the defeat at Sarikamish is the blame of Armenian soldiers for treachery.

The news, on the eve of the next Republican debate in South Carolina, could pose a political problem beyond the arcane campaign finance requirements.

The knock: After feeling the wrath of Rohit Sharma's extraordinary 209 - conceding 383 in total - and with half the side back in the pavilion, James Faulkner had a lot going against him. The Tasmanian had two lives before he reached 30 and promptly made India pay. In one Ravindra Jadeja over he clobbered 15 runs and brought up his half-century from 35 balls. It was from there that Faulkner exploded, taking three more boundaries from Jadeja's next over before punishing paceman Vinay Kumar for three fours and a six to motor from 78 to 99 in one brutal over. A single to cover was all he needed to reach his maiden ODI hundred, arriving at the milestone in 57 balls, which was then the fastest ever by an Australian. However, at that point the tourists needed 90 from 71 balls with only two wickets in hand. Faulkner and Clint McKay put on an Australian record 115 for the ninth wicket, but the challenge was too great, with the allrounder the last man out still 57 runs short. At the time, Faulkner's knock was the third-highest score by a No.7 batsman in ODI cricket and the highest by an Australian, but that record now belongs to someone else (see below).
The knock: By 2002, if there was one thing Australian fans, players and their opponents knew for certain it was that no run chase was impossible with Michael Bevan at the crease. At the MCG one January evening, Australia were in trouble after restricting the in-form Black Caps to a respectable 8-245. At their lowest point, Australia slumped to 6-82 when Ian Harvey was caught behind off the bowling of Bond, leaving only Bevan and the tail in pursuit of the distant target. Bevan – a human run-chase calculator – didn't panic in the face of such adversity. Instead, he set about building partnerships; firstly one worth 61 runs with Shane Warne, then a further 81 with the underrated lower-order batsman Brett Lee, which brought Australia within 22 runs of victory. Andy Bichel would be Bevan's last partner and he was made to run, with the senior batsman peeling off five consecutive twos in the penultimate over, with the fourth double bring the left-hander his century. Bichel, like Lee, was more than handy with the bat, and iced the game in the final over by hitting two boundaries to win by two wickets with three balls to spare. Once again, Bevan proved why he was the master of the one-day run chase.

The scene then cut to Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) sitting in some kind of government control center where Cade's scrap find is up on a bunch of monitors. After a call to action from Attinger we then see a bunch of federal agents pack into black SUVs and helicopters and make their way out to the Yaeger farm. The leader of the agents, Savoy (Titus Welliver), approaches Cade and his daughter and asks him to reveal the location of the Transformers. Cade makes a snide remark ("You know, there's a saying about people messing with people from Texas"), but this gets a violent reaction from Savoy, who tells his men to attack Tessa. In a flash we then see the Transformer in the shed burst out with guns blazing, saying "Here I am." It doesn't take long for the entire scene to turn to chaos, but Cade and Tessa are rescued when Shane (Jack Raynor) pulls up in his car. As they race away, it's revealed to Cade that Shane is Tessa's boyfriend – which is news that Cade is not very happy to hear.
It may be a little while before we get another preview of Transformers: Age of Extinction, but stay tuned in the coming months for more and stay tuned for more of our CinemaCon coverage later this week! Thanks to an action-packed Super Bowl spot and the trailer that launched earlier this month , we've already had the chance to see a good amount of Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction, but this evening at CinemaCon in Las Vegas we got a special treat. As part of their opening night presentation, Paramount Pictures delivered a full 10 to 15 minutes of footage from the explosive film, showing off various intro and action sequences from the upcoming blockbuster.After a packed montage full of CGI dinosaurs, a truck – possibly Optimus - driving through the desert, spaceships flying through a city, a massive car chase, and a shot of Stanley Tucci freaking out about being forced to hide in a big glass room, the extended footage began with Cade Yaeger (Mark Wahlberg) pulling up to his farmhouse in a tow truck pulling what looks like a huge hunk of junk. His daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and his employee/partner Lucas (TJ Miller) are waiting for him in the yard, and immediately start yelling at Cade the second he steps out of the cab. It is immediately clear that the Yaegers are having serious money problems and both Tessa and Lucas are upset that Cade would spend money on such a big piece of garbage. The patriarch swears that he'll be able to strip the truck for parts and that it will pay for itself, but his daughter and friend are hardly convinced, and instead argue that Cade wasn't even able to get Tessa a dress for prom. There is concern that our soon-to-be hero isn't responsible enough to care for himself, but he stresses that one day he will build something that matters.Later that evening Cade is working under the truck in a shed and excitedly calls out to Tessa and Lucas, who come rushing into the "garage." Cade tells them that he has found "not normal steel" in the vehicle, and when he hooks it up to a battery it not only suddenly comes alive but starts to talk, saying, "Calling all Autobots." Rather than matching Cade's excitement, Tessa and Lucas sprint out of the shred at top speed and are absolutely terrified to have an alien presence suddenly in their world. It turns out this fear is just a little bit justified.The scene then cut to Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) sitting in some kind of government control center where Cade's scrap find is up on a bunch of monitors. After a call to action from Attinger we then see a bunch of federal agents pack into black SUVs and helicopters and make their way out to the Yaeger farm. The leader of the agents, Savoy (Titus Welliver), approaches Cade and his daughter and asks him to reveal the location of the Transformers. Cade makes a snide remark ("You know, there's a saying about people messing with people from Texas"), but this gets a violent reaction from Savoy, who tells his men to attack Tessa. In a flash we then see the Transformer in the shed burst out with guns blazing, saying "Here I am." It doesn't take long for the entire scene to turn to chaos, but Cade and Tessa are rescued when Shane (Jack Raynor) pulls up in his car. As they race away, it's revealed to Cade that Shane is Tessa's boyfriend – which is news that Cade is not very happy to hear.The next sequence began with Optimus Prime doing battle with Galvatron on an open stretch of road, with Cade, Tessa and Shane at their feet trying not to get squashed by the giant robots. It's revealed that Galvatron is actually a remote-controlled Transformer (being manipulated from a control room by Stanley Tucci's character and a random guy) who was presumably created so that humans would have a weapon against a future alien invasion. While Cade and Shane are able to get to safety, Tessa gets caught in the middle of the fray and can't escape, eventually hiding in a parked car. The scene gets interrupted as a rocket slams into Optimus, knocking him back. We then see where the shot came from: Lockdown, another Transformer, is walking down the road with a giant spaceship behind him. Lockdown's face turns into an absolutely massive gun and Optimus is once again hit by a blast, this time knocking him on top of the car Tessa is in. As the new threats come closer, Lockdown gets back into the ship a tiny vehicle comes flying off of the big one, throwing down a net that captures both Optimus Prime and the car he is lying on. Cade sprints towards the ship and leaps to grab the netting, trying to free his daughter. His attempts are in vain, however, as he is unable to hold on and the aliens fly away. In frustration, Cade slams his fist on the ground in slow motion.The footage ended with another giant montage featuring all kinds of various action, including more explosive car chases, the main characters swinging down the side of a skyscraper on power lines, and Cade and Savoy having an epic chase across rooftops. The footage ended with a giant piece of alien machinery flying into a busy intersection and crushing a car. Cade exits the giant hunk of metal, and the driver of the car he crushed comes out to complain, saying, "I hope you have insurance." Cade reacts violently to this, and calls to his daughter: "Tessa, hand me my alien gun."It may be a little while before we get another preview of Transformers: Age of Extinction, but stay tuned in the coming months for more and stay tuned for more of our CinemaCon coverage later this week!

Let's start with the big fish first, Giorgios Samaras. While there is word that he may not even be fit enough to start or even appear tomorrow, there is a bit of gamesmanship regarding his status. Nevertheless we can still try to evaluate an OKC gameplan that will be centered around their superstar. Samaras are by far the most reputable name on the OKC team sheet, and brings an impressive résumé of experience to their squad. At 34-years old however, and having not played a full match for a while, there are still many questions to how fit and ready he will be tomorrow.

After a natural adjustment period to college life, the defenseman played for Team Sweden at the International Ice Hockey Federation's World Junior Championship. He picked up a goal and five points with a plus-five rating in seven games en route to a silver medal finish. But the blueliner wasn't done making strides just yet.
After the Combine he was rated the 51st skater in North America. According to Assistant General Manager Brent Flahr, the year the young defenseman put together prior to the draft caused him to rocket up the Wild's draft board. Without a first round pick, Minnesota selected him in the second round.
Despite the sluggish start, he hit his stride mid-season at the WJC in Malmo, Sweden on the host country's roster. Beyond winning the silver medal, the Umea, Sweden native led all Swedish defensemen with his play in the tournament.
Flahr noted that the defenseman still has some work to do in the weight room and needs to grow into his body, but the Wild remain excited about his potential, especially given how far he's come in recent seasons.

[vc_row_inner no_margin=”true” padding_top=”0px” padding_bottom=”0px” border=”none”]David Foucault is a fun May story. He's an extremely large man. With long blonde hair. And a thick French Canadian accent. He drives a Nissan Versa.How a 6-7, 305 human fits into such a small car is a question that defies physics. As expected, the Panthers signed Foucault Monday after his tryout at the team's rookie minicamp. But for those desperately hoping for anyone-other-than-Bryon-Bell at left tackle, Foucault isn't going to be the guy. At least he won't be in 2014, and perhaps even longer.After playing defensive line in high school, the Quebec native switched to guard for his first two seasons at Montreal University. He then shifted to tackle before his final season.So he's still very much learning the position, and while I'm not all that well-versed on Canadian college football, it's unlikely the Carabins are producing Crimson Tide-like talent.At his size, it's easy to see why Foucault interests the Panthers. They don't have a lot to lose by giving him a season to see if and how he develops.While guest hosting ‘The Drive' on WFNZ Monday, I talked to Montreal Alouettes general manager Jim Popp. He made Foucault the fifth-overall pick in last week's CFL draft, and I asked him for an estimate on Foucault's development into a pro.”He would not come in and start for us,” Popp answered. “He would be a guy that would be two years, maybe a third year in the making before he became a starter in the Canadian Football League. We were getting him for the future. That's why we drafted him.”Popp added that if fast-tracked, Foucault could possibly be NFL-ready in two years.So while he's an interesting story and an intriguing prospect, make no mistake — the Panthers' latest Canadian import is a big project. Yes, literally.OTHER TRANSACTIONS: In addition to Foucault, the Panthers signed punter Jordan Gay. He was with Carolina for the 2013 preseason, and he'll again give Brad Nortman's leg a rest over the next few months.The Panthers also released offensive linemen Travis Bond, Mike Jasper and Phillipkeith Manley.And according to his agent, the Panthers signed linebacker Billy Boyko.
The Stale Comic Book Movie Concept That The DCEU Is Avoiding With Wonder Woman By Matt Wood Random Article Blend Right off the bat, Wonder Woman is separating itself from the rest of the comic book herd. The most obvious way it's doing this is the fact that a woman is headlining, but DC Films isn't planning to stop there. It's important to remember that Wonder Woman is still an origin story, perhaps the most tired aspect of the modern comic book film. While audiences will see how Diana rises from a warrior to full-on superhero, DC Films hopes to do it in such a way that the film is still unique and fresh, while introducing one of the most iconic heroes on the planet. Charles Roven is a producer who's more than a little familiar with DC Comics. In addition to having produced The Dark Knight Trilogy, Roven has been a producer on almost every major film in the DCEU, from Man of Steel to the upcoming Justice League. Roven also provided his expertise on Wonder Woman, and he recently chatted with ComicBook about the what viewers can expect from the film. Wonder Woman will explain how Diana left Themyscira to eventually become the costumed heroine seen in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Roven was asked how they are keeping away from telling a formulaic origin story. We're hoping honestly that you won't say that when you see any of these movies. Get powers, fight bad guys... It's a journey of discovery that's way more profound than just learning that she's got physical abilities that others don't have. It's about helping mankind and being a symbol of all the things you could accomplish without war. At this point, moviegoers could recite the beats of an origin movie by heart; it's one of the most common types of stories in modern cinema. We've seen almost every major superhero origin play out on film (some of them twice!) by this point. I don't need another one; you don't need another one. DC Films seems to acknowledge this, and they are trying to address the issue by making the film more than just an origin. Sure, the familiar story beats will probably be present, but they are trying to more overtly play to the themes and message of the character. It's an approach they are also applying to Flash (whenever it comes out) and Aquaman, and I hope it works out. The last big origin story was Doctor Strange and while I like that movie, that's about as by-the-book as it gets in terms of plot. If Wonder Woman can buck this increasingly boring trend, then all the more power to it. Wonder Woman is directed by Patty Jenkins and stars Gal Gadot. The film is expected to hit theaters on June 2, 2017. WATCH: Henry Cavill's 7 Best Superman Moments Blended From Around The Web Facebook
Unaccustomed to international attention and wrong-footed by their social media-savvy opponents, the town's 3,200 residents simply went to ground. Requests for interviews with town officials went unanswered; the fishermen took a vow of silence.
But after years of keeping their counsel, Taiji's fishermen have finally spoken out, agreeing to talk to the Guardian about their work, their whaling heritage, and their determination to continue hunting dolphins.
Kai attributes that reticence down to what he claims are attempts by activists from Sea Shepherd and other conservation groups to manufacture confrontations, which they film and post online, and challenges claims that the practice of slaughtering dolphins beneath tarpaulin sheets is proof that he and his fellow fishermen have something to hide.
By killing dolphins and other small whales, fishermen are continuing a tradition that enabled their ancestors to survive before the days of mass transport and the availability of other sources of nutrition, adds Sangen.
Typically, fishermen pursue pods of dolphins across open seas, banging metal poles against their boats to confuse their hypersensitive sonar, before herding them into a narrow inlet. There, they are either slaughtered for their meat or selected and sold for large sums to aquariums and marine parks.
While dolphin meat for human consumption generates only modest profits, Taiji's fishermen can reportedly sell a live specimen to brokers for about 8,000 US dollars. A fully trained dolphin can then fetch more than 40,000 US dollars if sold overseas, and about half that in Japan.
The 20 or so Taiji fishermen who take to the sea between September and April to hunt bottlenose dolphins, pilot whales and other small cetaceans have been emboldened by the release of Okujirasama (A Whale of a Tale) – a documentary by the New York-based filmmaker Megumi Sasaki that counters what she describes as The Cove's one-sided treatment of a complex issue.
Kai dismisses claims that that he and other fishermen employ a singularly cruel method to kill the dolphins. “The way we work has changed with the times,” he says. In response to criticism, fishermen now dispatch the animals by inserting a knife into their neck, severing their brain stem – a method he claims is the most humane possible, but which some experts have said does not result in a painless or immediate death.
The fishermen appear to have reached an uneasy truce with overseas campaigners, first from Sea Shepherd, and now from the Dolphin Project, a group formed by the dolphin trainer-turned activist Ric O'Barry.

Passing now to our special question, we may understand the kind of confusion in which Liberalism has lost itself: and the origin of those mistaken classings of political measures which have misled it — classings, as we shall see, by conspicuous external traits instead of by internal natures. For what, in the popular apprehension and in the apprehension of those who effected them, were the changes made by Liberals in the past? They were abolitions of grievances suffered by the people, or by portions of them: this was the common trait they had which most impressed itself on men's minds. They were mitigations of evils which had directly or indirectly been felt by large classes of citizens, as causes to misery or as hindrances to happiness. And since, in the minds of most, a rectified evil is equivalent to an achieved good, these measures came to be thought of as so many positive benefits; and the welfare of the many came to be conceived alike by Liberal statesmen and Liberal voters as the aim of Liberalism. Hence the confusion. The gaining of a popular good, being the external conspicuous trait common to Liberal measures in earlier days (then in each case gained by a relaxation of restraints), it has happened that popular good has come to be sought by Liberals, not as an end to be indirectly gained by relaxations of restraints, but as the end to be directly gained. And seeking to gain it directly, they have used methods intrinsically opposed to those originally used.

Aguay-o: Buccaneers kicker Roberto Aguayo, a surprise pick in the second round as an underclassman by general manager Jason Licht, has gotten off to a terrible start with a missed extra point in his first exhibition, two missed field goals in the second, and a practice so bad this week that fans heckled him. Aguayo, who had a stellar career at Florida State, is obviously going through a mental slump. While everybody's having fun piling on Aguayo and Licht, and there is the possibility that he never recovers (a la former Dodgers second baseman Steve Sax), the odds are Aguayo pulls himself out of this at some point. Like losing streaks, all it takes is one good game, or kick in this instance, and Aguayo can get back on track. But, boy, Licht has to be nervous.

We were both taken to a restaurant we had agreed to meet the guy at. We looked the bike over, had a chat with him. It took me less than ten seconds to know it was our bike. The signal was for Harry to take his hat off. And about twenty seconds later, four police officers, two undercover and two in black and white, appeared out of nowhere and guided the young gentleman to the side. They were as discreet as four cops outside a restaurant with a patio can be. Cuffed him and guided (actually guided, not pushed) him over to a wall so he could just lean up against it and not have every passerby know he was handcuffed. I didn't overhear the conversation, because I didn't want to. I am sincerely sorry this kid got caught up in the middle of it. It's not his fault that he's a casualty. But after everyone's advice, I decided that I can't take responsibility for him. He is not my problem: getting my stolen bike back was my problem.
In United States v. 92 Buena Vista a woman had purchased a home with money that her boyfriend had given her without knowledge that the money came from drug-trafficking. She claimed the innocent owner defense, but the court ruled that it applied to her as well even if it was later nullified by the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000. There are many jurisdictions that refuse to take any position, leaving the determination of the conjunctive or disjunctive question to the lower courts.
Echoing State Bank of India chief Arundhati Bhattacharya's views, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor S.S. Mundra on Thursday expressed concern over farm loan waiver affecting credit discipline."The RBI's views has always been that farm loan waiver affects credit discipline," Mundra told reporters at the launch of Bandhan Bank's branch here.On March 15, Bhattacharya had expressed reservation over assurances and demand for complete farm loans waiver, coming from different quarters. The following day, Congressmen staged a protest outside the SBI headquarters at Nariman Point in Mumbai to protest.Those making the demand for loan waiver include Maharashtra's opposition parties and the ruling ally Shiv Sena, besides the Karnataka government, while assurances to this effect have been made in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Bhattacharya too said it will disturb credit discipline among borrowers, since they will keep expecting more such waivers in future and then those (future) loans will remain unpaid.On resolution of the non-performing assets (NPAs) issue, Mundra said discussions were on in this regard."A number of resolution mechanisms have been given to banks from time to time. Variety of cases will require use of different instruments," the RBI senior officer said."Valuation of stressed companies need to be transparent," he added.

Holocaust survivors living in the United States would receive federal funds designed to help them age at home, rather than having to move to an institution, according to a new bill drafted by the Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her Republican counterpart Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.

Yes, you can write music via notation if you so desire, though I would again reference the list of musicians at the top and consider this: not only did all those artists not need notation to write music, but the act of writing without notation directly facilitated their ability to create the music they did. For just about all non-classical/theater music, the use of notation is almost non-existent. I myself have played as a sideman on many major tours with artists like Lisa Marie Presley, Everclear, Nick Lachey, Seven Mary Three and more and never once have I been given sheet music. In fact, it's the exact opposite: here's the CD, see you on Thursday.

Stone's “robots for everyone” project, part of the College of Natural Science's Freshman Research Initiative, has big ambitions. From freshmen to PhD candidates, the project gives researchers a sandbox to try out new ideas in robotics, from gesture recognition to navigating in three dimensions. The plan is to have the robots roam freely around the Gates Complex, helping students, staff, and visitors with simple tasks. An open-ended project, Stone's group is looking to see what they can do with these helper bots—and see how people naturally interact with them.

Well, those are the basics. The life of a fisherman in ArcheAge is exciting, with every outing offering a new opportunity for adventure. Will you narrowly escape the grasp of some filthy pirates, or will you hook the biggest, baddest fish in the sea and bring in over 100 gold? Even that payout will pale in comparison to the fishing contest, which, when enabled, will reward those who get the biggest fish during the weekly contest.

In two months of open warfare costly battles had been fought back and forth in the hinterlands of France and Belgium. Constant contact had worn the armies down, shrunk their reserves of manpower and turned the war into not much more than a grappling match.
In March 2012, Mattis was once again trying to calm down Congressmen baying for Pakistan's blood over bin Laden, as attitudes against Islamabad hardened across Capitol Hill and intelligence circles. Mattis told the House Armed Services that he “did not believe that anyone in Pakistan was aware that the Al-Qaeda chief was in Abbottabad”, The News reported. The article also quoted him as saying that “he was well aware that nobody was in the knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad”.

But Zakaria's real purpose isn't to tell the president what to do; it's to tell him what not to do: namely, work with or empower the Syrian opposition. This is of course the ancillary component of Obama's policy to “degrade and ultimately destroy” ISIL. By 2017, the United States hopes to have trained and equipped some 5,000 Syrian rebels as a kind of counterterrorism strike force in Syria, one that would hopefully coordinate directly with the United States against ISIL. As Zakaria's colleague David Ignatius noted last week, drawing on discussions with administration officials, many of whom want greater U.S. intervention in Syria, the White House might double that number. Perhaps if only to ensure that half a billion dollars in taxpayer money aren't immediately wasted, Secretary of State John Kerry also favors imposing a no-fly zone over northern Syria to protect these would-be U.S. assets from slaughter by Syrian Air Force barrel bombs, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey told ABC News' This Week that he could “anticipate circumstances in the future” where one will be necessary. Thus, just as key decision-makers are finally and rightly concluding that the containment strategy has failed — and advocating the more promising course of helping the United States' Syrian allies beat ISIL —Zakaria argues for the exact opposite.
The player creates a character, naming them and distributing 50 points between three skills: driving, marksmanship and mechanic. The player's character starts in New York, Friday 1-1-2030. Without a car the player has to enter amateur night in which they are provided a vehicle in order to raise enough money to buy and equip their own vehicle. With their own vehicle, a character can begin performing courier missions between the various towns along the Atlantic seaboard—including Syracuse, Boston, Manchester (Origin's headquarters at the time, which could be visited in the game) and Atlantic City among a few. The character may also enter more distinguished Arena events to earn money as well as take to the highways to fight the other cars and salvage their parts. In this sense, the game was very open-ended in what the player could do. The game also had a storyline, involving certain critical courier tasks, such as carrying important criminal evidence against "Mr. Big", through the dangerous terrain between cities.

There is also a real interesting story regarding Ric Flair's shenanigans a few weeks ago when he missed the bus on the European tour. According to the story, Flair told a friend that the company pressured Kurt Angle to stay on the tour after Kurt found out that his pregnant girlfriend went into labor and both she and the unborn baby were in serious danger. While Angle made it home in time, the company allegedly held him up from leaving which forced Kurt to arrive home much later than expected.
By then the hoodie wasn't so much an exhibit in a murder trial as an idea, a cultural marker in an international conversation about race. And thus a question remains unanswered ever since that night of July 13, when jurors acquitted George Zimmerman, a gung-ho neighborhood watchman and wannabe cop, of murder and manslaughter charges in the death of Martin: What will become of the hoodie? What becomes of the courtroom artifacts of our national obsessions, of our most prurient or most substantive crime-and-justice fixations?
The former England U21 and Nigerian international has joined the Cod Army until the end of the season.Ameobi, who has made 298 appearances in the Premier League for both Newcastle United and Crystal Palace, will bring a wealth of experience to the Cod Army squad.The 6”3 striker has even scored for the Magpies in the Champions League against FC Barcelona and was recently playing regular first team football at Bolton Wanderers.Shola turned down different offers in favour of a move to the Fylde Coast and manager Steven Pressley is delighted to have the frontman on board.He said: “In January we signed a number of younger players and it was vital to the group that we brought in a player with experience.“We certainly couldn't get any more experience than Shola Ameobi and we are absolutely delighted with that. He is not only a very good player; he is a terrific character that can bring a lot to the group.“It is vital that he has been playing as sometimes unattached players at this stage in the season, the one thing they are lacking is a level of fitness.“Shola has been involved at Bolton Wanderers on a regular basis for the vast majority of the season and he is raring to go ahead of Saturday's trip to Port Vale.”

Turn Medicare into a voucher scheme: Romney has been characteristically vague about this element, too, but he's made plain his intention to adopt a scheme like the one House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan has proposed. Today Medicare guarantees a set of benefits to all seniors, by providing a government-run insurance plan with the option to enroll in a private alternative. Romney would instead opt to create a “premium support” plan, which basically means giving seniors vouchers and having them use it to get insurance. (Romney would preserve traditional, government-run Medicare as an option, but many experts question whether it would survive for long.
I had a girlfriend living with me at the time, and as I looked over to her in bed, I said, "Turn on the TV, something is wrong". We scanned the TV looking for coverage and at the time, not many stations were up to speed on the event. I finished getting ready for work and got my kids up to get ready for school. I found CNN news station that was showing the coverage and I saw smoke coming from the first tower. My children were now awake sitting around the kitchen table eating breakfast and getting dressed for school. I had tried putting a call into my ex spouse and she didn't pick up my call so I left her a voice message asking her if school was still open for the day. I called into my office, but it was still too early and nobody was in to answer the phones.
As the rest of the events unfolded that day, I was starting to sense a lot of fear in the air. I had gone back to my house and watched TV with my girlfriend and listened to her version of an emergency, evacuation plan. At that moment, I had to speak my peace and share my plans. "I can't leave my children..." which was my response to her inquiry. "And it's not fair to leave their mother behind either, so any plans that we have must include her and my children..." Needless to say, the next 24 hours of that discussion took on many different directions but I never wavered from including my children and ex-spouse. How that girlfriend relationship ended is another story to tell, however, the reality of dating any divorced parent is that your life is involved with all parties in the family, including the ex-spouse.
There are all sorts of secret spots in the city — galleries, designer ateliers, spas, hair salons and certainly bars and restaurants. Catalans are renowned merchants willing to welcome the world (and recently it can feel like the whole world) to their capital. But as residents they also like a whiff of novelty and exclusivity for themselves. And like the Italians and French with whom they share some cultural and linguistic roots, Catalans love to do things properly — they might even say perfectly. Whether constructing a cathedral or baking a croissant, there is an inherent embrace of quality, design and craftsmanship for the task at hand. Put those together and you get Barcelona's peculiar commercial “underbelly,” albeit a very toned and buffed one. Over the years I've been lucky to have local friends show me their favorite spots. As a writer it can be challenging to describe what I find as I often run out of synonyms: you can't really call the cocktails at Mutis “drinks.”
ENGLISH all-rounder Ben Stokes is heading to New Zealand and could be back playing cricket as early as this weekend, in a move that has rendered champion Australian batsman Dean Jones “speechless”.
ago paid the penalty of his too great faith in the safety of balloons. Ascending, on Saturday last, with Captain Templer end Mr. Agg-Gardner, from Bath, the balloon drifted rapidly to- wards the Channel, and when within half a mile of the sea, near Bridport, they attempted a descent. The balloon came down rather too rapidly, and the car struck the ground with such force that Captain Templer and Mr. Agg-Gardner were thrown out, the former being bruised, and the latter having his leg broken. Mr. Powell remained in the car, and the balloon immediately shot up again with great velocity, and went off in the direction of the sea, and no one as yet knows what became of it. Some- thing was seen to fall into the sea soon after, which many believed to be the balloon. Again, some French fishermen stated that they had seen a large balloon floating down the Channel; and various persons in Alderney asserted that they had seen a large balloon floating eastward in the air. However, nothing certain is as yet known of its fate, and it is almost im- possible that Mr. Powell, even if still in the balloon, should be alive. It is said that there was no supply of water or food, and the extreme cold would render food and cordials absolutely essential to life. If Mr. Powell remained in the balloon, it can only be his corpse which is floating about with it now.
OTTAWA Senators defenseman Ben Harpur is as Canadian as they come, but when he visits Australia to play in the Ice Hockey Classic next week, it will be a homecoming of sorts for the rising star.
That was Harpur. And after a few years spent playing for the Binghamton Senators in the American Hockey League, this season the 22-year-old, 6-foot-6 defenseman finally got his NHL call-up with Ottawa.
“In the playoffs one of the Ottawa defensemen got hurt and I had the opportunity to get into the line-up and play some huge games at some great arenas. The whole experience was unbelievable.”
So let's just say that any hit batsman is going to result in a penalty, which has to be severe enough to deter it but not enough to inordinately impact a game or a season. The present penalty of first base obviously has never stopped pitchers who wanted to extract payback for something. How about two bases? That may cause a situation where a hitter tries to get hit, and you would be back to the whole subjective thing, like flopping in basketball. Maybe we just say that any hit batsman results in an ejection. No, then we would have a 400-pound guy on the roster just to have his belly sag over the plate, and he would lead off every time Justin Verlander pitched.
This would work for hit batsmen. If you hit a guy once or twice a year, you deserve the benefit of the doubt, regardless of the situation. If you hit 20 guys a year, we should assume that you have anger management problems or a lack of command. So I propose that we pick a number and say that if you hit that many guys a year, you will miss five games. Like the NBA, every hit batsman or two after that point will result in additional penalties. What should the threshold be? Well, the Major League leader hit 14 last year, so I would say let's do half of that. Seven hit batsmen results in an automatic five-game suspension, and every two HBPs after that result in another five games.

There's also the stresses of different pollutants — we have plastic pollution, like the Pacific Gyere, which is a huge area that's full of plastic.

This class project took place not just at the level of the firm, but also the state. There were various bills, like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act, deregulating banking. And there was, of course, the Fed. When then Fed Chairman Paul Volcker (yes, that Volcker, of the Volcker rule) jacked up interest rates from 1979 through the early 1980s, declaring “the standard of living of the average American must decline,” this was the opening shot of the Reagan era offensive against the working class. Volcker forgot to mention that this was so that “the standard of living of the top 20% of Americans will increase.” The Fed has in fact consistently served certain interests over others, not just because of some conspiratorial connections, but because the ‘expert' knowledge supplied by bankers and their friends at the Fed are taken simply as value neutral economic advice, rather than as highly interested knowledge. How else are we to understand recent revelations that the Fed loaned $7.7 trillion interest-free to major banks between August 2007 and April 2010, only to have the banks loan most of that back to the US (via bond purchases and the like) at a higher interest rate – yielding them $13 billion in profits? We should take at face value Fed statements that “Our lending programs served to prevent a collapse of the financial system and to keep credit flowing to American families and businesses.” This was not just some secret project to redistribute money upwards to the Fed's banker friends. It was also the working of ideology – the belief that the only way to save the economy was to shovel more and more money into the banks sitting at the top so as to get the credit wheel spinning again. This is a belief that developed and won hegemonic status over a long period of time, winning acceptance well beyond those whose interests it has served (remember this recent debate in which Yglesias argued for easier money against the now prescient objections of, among others, Henwood and Robin?). This belief forms part of the debt-based social model that has dominated our political economy for decades.
Hopkins grew up surrounded by the blues, and thanks to a chance meeting at a church picnic with Blind Lemon Jefferson he managed to become a legendary bluesman whose like isn't seen in the world anymore. Based in the Third Ward, he caught the attention of Aladdin Records, and went to Los Angeles to record the first of what some estimate to be as many as 1,000 original songs. He still holds the record for more blues albums recorded than any other musician in the history of the genre, and is arguably the most influential popular guitarist of all time. Yet he never really wanted to be anywhere other than at home in Houston, and that's where he lays to this day.

Next, we have an interaction with a businessman withholding directions from his girlfriend because he's busy. I know this character is a chief villain, but give him something less unbelievably petty than him asking “What's in it for me?” in response to his significant other's request for directions. The entire exchange takes more time than it would take to give anybody directions from anywhere to anywhere. This is poor characterization because it overplays his hand. A better movie and a better set of actors would have played the exact same situation as flirting. This movie's message is already getting in the way of its execution, and, sorry Dean Cain, you're just not great at this job.
Atheist girlfriend interviews Willie Robertson about his Jesus-banging. Relevant, I guess. I initially assumed he was a ripoff of a Duck Dynasty personality, but turns out he actually is a Duck Dynasty personality. When I assumed he was a ripoff, I was ready to lambast the movie for not having the balls to address the issue directly. They do address it directly by having him in the movie as himself, but it feels awkward having an overlap of real-world personality with the fictional narrative. It's still not dealing with the Duck Drama in its real-world environment; it's dealing with an actual, recognizable publicity situation in a fictional world designed to support the character. It would have been more digestible if the character was still regulated to his space as a public figure, something watched and commented on by our active characters. As a conceptual tactic, it's interesting, but it's poorly implemented, so it's jarring.
Okay. Atheist girlfriend of Dean Cain has just been diagnosed with cancer. The doctor says, “Look I know you're very important, and the world can't get along without you, but the world's getting ready to do exactly that.” That's some quality bedside manner, right there. It so cleverly disguises accusations of hubris. “Stilted and transparently pedantic” seems too kind a description of this dialogue.
Back to the protagonist. No one understands him. He's on his own. His girlfriend doesn't want him to risk their future over a debate with his philosophy teacher. This is a solid scene for the 40s, or even an 80s flick.
Dean Cain breaks up with his girlfriend after she tells him she has cancer. Admittedly, he's been built up as a sociopath from his first scene, which I think was his only other scene, but since he's only had two (maybe three, it's hard to pay attention), there's no emotional umph here. His entire character is Bad Person, so it's not surprising, disappointing, or especially moving unless you were predisposed to hate Dean Cain. I watched the good seasons of Lois & Clark, so my takeaway is he just needed a paycheck. There needs to be some investment in a character before he or she betrays us. Anyway, he seems to still be in the movie, so there may be more points for him to lose.
And turning point! Exactly halfway through the movie, we discover the professor's girlfriend is Christian. That. Changes. Everything. I. Hope. It really doesn't, because the narrative is so divorced from the actual plot points. The lives and actions of the characters are all wearing the concrete galoshes of the movie's message. Curiously, the first time I tried to watch this movie, I had to turn it off and watch Nymphomaniac, which suffers from exactly the same problem: the dialogue's insistence on making its larger point interferes with the believability of the characters. And there are no explosions. Fundamentally, The Book of Eli made the same argument as God's Not Dead, and The Book of Eli was awesome. I got to the end of that movie shouting, “Fuck YEAH, God! Kick some motherfucking secular ass!” And The Book of Eli never once explicitly told me to think that: it was just a solid action movie.
The potentially redeemable Hercules gets hit by a car while trying to make peace with his Christian girlfriend (at least I think that's what he was doing). Cool rev tells him God's giving him another chance, by hitting him with a car, putting him in enormous pain, and making him afraid. He converts and dies. So that happened. Putting a character's primary personal revelation in the context of near-death is a copout. I love Star Wars, but no, Vader does not get a pass. The character should either go guns blazing or have to deal with the fact that they've wasted their life. Hercules doesn't even have to come clean to the protagonist.
Gainor is the vice president of the Media Research Center, a $6 million-a-year organization that has been praised by Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and Newt Gingrich, and he is often cited, interviewed and otherwise taken very seriously by Washington Post ombudsman Andrew Alexander.
The Emergency Banking Act, an amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, was introduced on March 9, 1933, to a joint session of Congress, and was passed the same evening amid an atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty as over 100 new Democratic members of Congress swept into power determined to take radical steps to address banking failures and other economic malaise. The EBA was one of President Roosevelt's first projects in the first 100 days of his presidency. The sense of urgency was such that the act was passed with only a single copy available on the floor of the House of Representatives and legislators voted on it after the bill was read aloud to them by Chairman of the House Banking Committee Henry Steagall. Copies were made available to senators as the bill was being proposed in the Senate, after it had passed in the House.

In hypothetical “Situation 2” a 22-year-old man has a 15-year-old girlfriend with whom he wishes to have sexual relations. The archdiocese writes, “In principle, persons of legal age may sleep with minors, provided it is consensual sexual acts/intercourse. It gets difficult, however, whenever sexual acts or intercourse are forced.”
In “Situation 5,” readers are told, “Laura (15) would like to sleep with her boyfriend and considers different contraceptives.” However, she's afraid her parents will find out. The archdiocese notes that, as “Laura” is under 16 years of age, her doctor can inform her parents that she wants oral contraceptives. However, “Laura” can “try to convince the doctor that she is mature enough to make that decision.”

"The proposed area is the largest offshore wind zone in federal water. It's more than 742,000 acres — roughly the size of Rhode Island. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell says the Atlantic coast of Massachusetts is prime offshore wind property. " 'We think there is high potential and high interest, and relatively low conflict in the areas that we picked,' she says. "That conflict refers to the countless hurdles offshore wind turbines have hit, including objections from commercial fishermen and residents. "The proposed area is roughly 12 miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. It has the potential to nearly double the federal offshore wind area currently available for development."
I am a sniffer. I have always sniffed because my nose has always been stuffed. When I think back to my earliest memories they are filled with me sniffing. It used to drive my mother crazy. I remember a time my brother was talking to one of my girlfriends and he's asking her, ‘How can you stand his constant sniffing?'
I never looked into curing my sniffing because it was something that had plagued me all of my life. I didn't know that there was any other way to handle it. If it was such a bother to everyone, how come my folks never took me to see a doctor about it? I felt like it was my fault, like a birth defect and not a medical issue. It really is a wonder that I ever had girlfriends or even got married.
Where did this ginned-up phony rape “epidemic” originate? What is the source of the “one in five women” number? A 2007 Justice Department survey that has been helpfully analyzed by Glenn Kessler of the Washington Post. Anyone familiar with social science methodology can examine the questions asked in that survey and see that the fundamental problem is how the questions were phrased: Respondents were asked about “unwanted sexual contact” and even attempted “unwanted sexual contact.” In other words, if your boyfriend even tries to do something “unwanted,” you're a victim.

Gurib-Fakim was the Vice Chairman of the Planet Earth Institute, which is an international NGO and charity that works to increase Africa's scientific independence. On the Planet Earth Institute's website they note that, “Africa's scientific output is the lowest in the world. As a continent of over a billion people and more than 50 nations, it has been producing roughly the same amount of scientific research as the Netherlands for the last 20 years…Africa [has] the world's lowest tertiary enrollment rate – of seven percent compared to a world average of thirty percent.” Their hope is to get more students around the world interested in STEM subjects at university.
Brown, 50, still maintains celebrity status on the right, and he's one of the few freshmen to carry a national profile; on Sunday, he's scheduled to be a guest on CBS's “Face the Nation,” a rare Sunday morning appearance for a newly elected senator. And for now, most Republicans in the Senate and conservative activists off the Hill have given him a pass, saying he represents a different constituency than most of the other 40 Republicans and needs to position himself in the political middle in order to stand a chance at winning reelection in 2012.
Sources tell Tomahawk Nation that Wilder allegedly grabbed his girlfriend away from the deputy as he was trying to arrest her and then allegedly slapped the deputy's hand. The deputy was unharmed.
Wilder's side of the story, as told to the Tallahassee Democrat by his attorney, is that he never touched the officer and was attempting to show him a text message between his girlfriend and her attorney.
Following a second loss to Bermane Stiverne – the May '14 rematch doubling as his second career title shot – Arreola saw his 2015 run get off to a shaky start. Grossly out of shape at a near-career heavy 262¼ lbs., he struggled mightily in an otherwise thrilling eight-round win over journeyman Curtis Harper, which served on the first-ever installment of Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) on Spike TV.
My boyfriend of 2 and a half years called me a liar and untrustworthy because I decided I wasn't actually in the mood to have sex. It was easier to lie there and fake orgasms than have the fight that would ensue if I said ‘no'. He was a ‘nice guy', and probably has no idea that what he did was rape. But not all guys are like that.
Christine Zeyen and her boyfriend moved to San Jose from Arizona a few months ago, hoping to improve their financial and work situation.
Zeyen works about 30 hours a week in behavioral therapy and receives financial help from her father to boost her income to roughly $25,000 annually. Her boyfriend makes about $60,000 a year working for Frito Lay. But in San Jose, that's far from enough.
Last year, after renting in Portland for more than two years, Hannah Risser-Sperry and her boyfriend Nick decided to buy a home. Their eye was on Portland's St. Johns neighborhood, a reviving but detached part of the city tucked 10 miles north of downtown where the Willamette River meets the Columbia. Their budget was $300,000, a number they thought would be fair for St. Johns—though they didn't think so for long. “When we started looking in St. Johns it seemed a reasonable spot to look because it wasn't super close in, but had its own charm,” Risser-Sperry says. “But quickly we realized everyone noticed that, too.” The couple quickly realized they would be up against overwhelming cash offers to buy a home. When they lost a 700-square foot house listed for $230,000 to a cash bid of $325,000, the dream of St. Johns was over. In a city outsiders know for its weirdness, they had become the most normal thing of all: prospective homebuyers locked out by Portland's new rules.
According to current FCC policy, 'broadband' means 4Mbps down/1Mbps up. That's been the definition since 2010, when it was upgraded from a (hilariously slow) 200Kbps. However, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler recently outlined a plan to update that definition, to 25Mbps down/3 up. It's a position supported by a number of companies, including Netflix; but unsurprisingly, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) is dead against the plan.
Some viewers branded the joke 'homophobic,' and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a Thursday interview that the agency had received 'a number of complaints' about the joke and would investigate the incident for a violation of standards.
My girlfriend and I have been breaking in Vibram Fivefingers in preparation for the massive walk we are doing. Have you ever seen these shoes? They're amazing for you knees and give you no blisters, but they are the ugliest thing imaginable. Yesterday, I wore them with a sweet bowtie I put on for Easter. I looked like a crazy person.
"He's always been a team player. He's understanding that, although he's our best player and our go-to guy, there are times when other guys need to go in and do it as well and chip away in order for him to come in and seal the deal," Capitals defenseman Karl Alzner said. "He understands now exactly why he's not out there at times. It's not a shock to me or anybody."
It is one thing for a Tory gentleman Brexiteer, taking a psychological canter over to the wrong side of the tracks, to conclude that Britain is two countries and that the poor are having a tough time, thanks to globalisation and the “establishment”. But what is his prescription for the social problems of Boston? Extra evensong? An added dollop of deference, spread evenly across the parish? Free community copies of Edmund Burke?

On that fatal night at Met Center on Jan. 13, 1968, the Minnesota North Stars center, playing against the Oakland Seals, carried the puck across the blue line and cut to the right while Seals defensemen Larry Cahan and Ron Harris closed in. One of their sticks tangled with Masterton's skates as he slid a pass to his wing, and he lost his balance, pitching forward. He didn't see the other defender, who caught him with a clean check that knocked him backward. Masterton, who was not wearing a helmet, smacked the back of his head on the ice. "It sounded like a baseball bat hitting a ball," teammate André Boudrias recalled.
Back at the 1968 All-Star Game, discussion among beat writers went beyond the helmet debate to come up with a way to commemorate the league's first casualty. The Professional Hockey Writers Association proposed -- and the league immediately approved -- the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy to be awarded annually to the player who best exemplifies the virtues of perseverance, courage and sportsmanship that Masterton displayed.
Rohit Sharma's is a name that needs no introductions in the world of cricket. From being a regular middle order batsman for the Indian cricket team to shattering some international batting records, this 30-year-old from Nagpur, who once was not fortunate enough to be raised by his parents on account of his passion for the sport and the family's poverty, is now one of the top 100 celebrities of India, in terms of income, fame, and success.
From starting as a steady middle-order batsman for India, Rohit is unarguably one of the most reliable match-winners for the national team right now. After the era of Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, and Sourav Ganguly, Team India had found an apt replacement for the position of opener in Rohit Sharma. Rohit currently holds the record for being the highest run-scorer in an ODI innings, when he smashed a valiant 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014. Before this knock, he had one more ODI double hundred to his name, from when he made 209 runs against Australia in 2013. It was in these innings that Rohit hit 16 massive sixes, which is the most by a batsman in ODI cricket, alongside A.B. De Villiers from South Africa and Chris Gayle from the West Indies.
From being someone who could not afford to get decent training to becoming one of the most valuable batsman the Indian team possesses, Rohit Sharma's sense of determination and his love for the sport in unparalleled, making him quite an inspiration for the cricketing faithful in the country.
It is now impossible to make the case that the operation to remove Saddam was strategically justifiable. But President George W. Bush at least left his successor a war that was being conducted more or less successfully by the Americans and their allies on Inauguration Day, 2009. President Obama's withdrawal of all American forces, after a disagreement about applicable law for U.S. servicemen with the admittedly impossible prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki (an Iranian stooge, but one whose stolen reelection the Obama administration tolerated), has led to a fairly steady and recently precipitate descent of international comprehension of long-term American goals and perceived interests.
It is a painful and notorious narrative. The Obama administration believes that U.S. involvement in the world has been largely harmful: Obama has decried the lack of alliance consultation by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill as they directed the war efforts of the Western Allies “brandies in hand.” He has apologized for President Truman's use of the atomic bomb against Japan and for President Eisenhower's approval of the removal of (the wildly incompetent if not mad) Mohammad Mosaddegh as leader of Iran and the return of the shah. This was an astonishing sequence of criticisms of three of America's most distinguished leaders and arguably the most generally esteemed statesman in the world of the past 150 years (Churchill).
SANAA (Reuters) - Jets belonging to a Saudi-led coalition killed at least 20 people at a wake in northern Yemen on Sunday, local tribesmen said, as warplanes pounded Houthis and other forces behind a missile strike that had killed dozens of Gulf Arab soldiers.
The latest ingredient used by scientists in the fight against disease …..the blue crayfish. On this farm deep in the southern Israeli desert the crustaceans have been raised for decorative purposes for years. But farmer Yossi Ben noticed his band of Australian Blue Crayfish had an unusual trait. SOUNDBITE (Hebrew) YOSSI BEN, FARMER, CEO AND CHAIRMAN OF 'AMORPHICAL', SAYING: "These crayfish build shells 10 times faster than any other crustacean around the world. The shell is built from calcium. Then I discovered a little cell called a gastrolith, comprised of calcium that the crayfish produces or collects. I took this organ to scientists who studied it and it became clear that the entire world was looking for it." Scientists put the gastrolith under the microscope and were astonished by what they saw - a form of calcium called stable amorphous calcium carbonate. Calcium deficiency in humans can lead to osteoporosis. The calcium found in the crayfish is at least a hundred times more soluble in water than common crystalline forms of calcium available on the market. It also has double the absorption rate. Ben has set up a biotech firm he's called Amorphical, to manufacture synthetic supplements made from it. He says animal tests showed prevention of bone loss from osteoporosis. A clinical trial run by scientists for the company showed postmenopausal women absorbed the supplements at twice the rate of crystalline calcium. (SOUNDBITE) (English) PROFESSOR NACHUM VAISMAN, FORMER HEAD OF CLINICAL NUTRITION UNIT IN THE TEL AVIV SOURASKY MEDICAL CENTRE WHO CONDUCTED CLINICAL TRIAL FOR 'AMORPHICAL', SAYING: "I think this is a revolution. // The question that we still have to show, and we've shown it at least on animals, is that this calcium once it comes into the body, into the blood, is really put in the bone, in the right places." Accoridng to Ben, clinical trials on Israeli cancer patients will begin next year after animal tests showed changes in the behaviour of affected cells.
2. Who's the best defenceman this season?
The only other defenceman to get multiple votes was Montreal's Shea Weber (three). Ottawa's Erik Karlsson, Tampa's Victor Hedman and Minnesota's Ryan Suter got one vote apiece.
The Toronto Maple Leaf centre dominated in the same fashion as Burns did in defenceman voting. Matthews received 20 votes compared to four for Winnipeg's Patrik Laine.
Not every black leader has embraced the move to scrub the three horsemen from Stone Mountain. Former Atlanta mayor and civil rights standout Andrew Young said sandblasting the mountain could amount to a damaging “re-fight” of the Civil War. And political observers are not sure how hot the issue will burn in a state that is growing younger and, slowly, more Democratic in recent years.
The cost of tuition may make you think that a school will eventually get you a high paying job, but that's not always the case. Also, schools with high freshmen retention rates and high graduation rates often reflect a great support system within the school. These are important things to consider, rather than just school prestige.
Freshmen retention rate = 97%
Freshmen retention rate = 96%
With a total in-state tuition of $19,257 UF has to remain an option on your list. It's interesting that most freshmen return to the school but they remain out of the top 100 of 4-year graduation rate. Honestly, I'm not sure if that says anything bad about their school … maybe students just want to stick about to see the next Tim Tebow or Joakim Noah.
Freshmen retention rate = 89%

For this piece, I used two rankings lists: the U.S. News ranking for freshmen retention and the Forbes Best Buy Colleges rankings. (When available, I also include the U.S. News ranking for 4-year graduation rates.)
The 437-page plan swipes at the oil industry by nixing a suite of tax incentives for the biggest oil companies, like Exxon and Shell. It would end write-offs for drilling costs and big companies' ability to claim a lucrative deduction on domestic manufacturing income, among other incentives. It also sets new fees for some oil and gas wells, and curtails a program that allows royalty-free production in deep Gulf of Mexico waters. Elsewhere, the bill would create a new system of tax incentives for low-carbon electricity and transportation-fuel production that would streamline the existing patchwork of credits, creating a more flexible system that's based on the level of emissions cuts. (Those two provisions are similar to a green-tax overhaul that then-Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus floated in late 2013.) Other tax provisions would overhaul and extend incentives for energy-efficient homes and buildings. Democrats are also dusting off a long-standing plan to mandate more energy savings in the power system. The bill would require that electric and natural-gas utilities cut energy use by 20 percent by 2030. This “Energy Efficiency Resource Standard” would save consumers $150 billion over the next 15 years, an estimate of the measure's effects states.
Many in the Republican leadership, however, decried the ruling, calling it an overreach of the federal government and the courts. One prominent state legislator, House Judiciary Chairman Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, said one option being considered is for the state to get out of the marriage business altogether.
A Florida man claims that his girlfriend asphyxiated while performing oral sex on him, and wants to show a judge and jury the supposed murder “weapon,” as proof of his innocence.
“[The accused] admitted from the start that he choked his girlfriend on Oct. 28, 2015,” the Sun Sentinel details, “but he never said how.”

The cinematic element is that it's in 4K, which makes all the difference, and also makes it a lot more difficult to do. You need more kits and people and there's a huge amount of data, which has to be shipped back and makes the edit take longer. But the quality of the films are amazing mainly because we took with us quite a lot of the sound cameramen that we used to work with in the old days on Top Gear. Over the years, we've been honed in with probably the best team in the world for filming cars and recording the sound of cars. It's mainly down to them. A bit of it is 4K, but that in itself is just the tool. The tool doesn't do the job. It's the craftsperson who does the job, and we have the best picture and sound-craft people in the business.

In their November meeting, the University of California Board of Regents said it was looking to expand the UC's financial aid program to provide such things as multiyear financial aid packages and summer grants to students. The UC's Total Cost of Attendance Working Group, a group that includes administrators and UC regents, examined UC Santa Barbara's Promise Scholars Program, a pilot scholarship that offers multiyear financial aid awards for select freshmen and transfer students. The working group suggested the UC Office of the President work with campus administrations to expand the program.
The Promise Scholars Program currently offers some incoming freshmen a minimum of $120,000 in aid for four years and some transfer students a minimum of $60,000 in aid for two years. UC Merced hopes to launch a similar program in the fall of 2018.
“It's a win-win situation,” Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Chris Devaney told POLITICO. “It heightens the profile of the party and gives donors someone that they want to see. And it brings more attention to your event.”
Minnesota Republican Chairman Tony Sutton declined to say how much the events raised for the cash-strapped state party but called the Gingrich and Romney visits “well-timed” because the state GOP was involved in a contested election to hold the governorship.

For example, as most freshmen taking a course in “The Bible as Literature” at a secular University learn, the historical accuracy of some biblical stories are questioned by many scholars, and It's hard to deny that the Bible contains some apparent contradictions and some material that seems to fly in the face of modern science.

What happens now depends on whether leaders and statesmen take charge or leave the next chapter to be written by bureaucrats and bankers. This is now far beyond euros and drachmas. That is where statesmen must prevail.
“I hate it when the chairman's right, but he's been talking about this for two years, and I — in retrospect, I think he was right,” King said of Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has long pushed for direct U.S. intervention in Syria against the forces of President Bashar al-Assad as well as the Islamic State.

You would think Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto would have his plate full with the Iguala Massacre (in which Mexican police and gang hitmen attacked and killed students, then disappeared 43 others) and a domestic political scandal. Violence is rampant in Mexico and well over two-thirds of Mexicans report they feel unsafe.
With the projected cost of the abortion well over the typical $450-$500 price for an early term abortion, it's obvious that Bailey and her boyfriend are raising funds to take the life of their child in a late abortion near viability. The couple say they are raising funds for the abortion because insurance will not cover it.
The lawyer for Titans defensive lineman Sammie Hill on Wednesday called sexual assault accusations against his client "bogus."
Freshman U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Palm City, voted Thursday for the Republican health care overhaul bill backed by President Donald Trump and immediately came under fire from Democrats and liberal groups who see a chance to reclaim his competitive Palm Beach-Treasure Coast district.
Some commentators have welcomed the announcement as setting a new national standard - that all governments should have at least two independent investigation bodies: an ombudsman to deal with administrative complaints, and a standing royal commission to deal with corruption. Indeed, NSW now has three bodies - the ombudsman, independent commission against corruption, and the police integrity commission.
But if we look at the federal decision, there are two quite separate issues mixed up here. First, there is a question about who guards the guards. The Attorney-General has focused on problems over which investigation bodies get to use federal phone tapping powers, refusing to authorise phone tapping by the Victorian Ombudsman, in support of the Victorian Opposition's campaign that only a new anti-corruption commission should have such power. But apart from the politics of supporting the state Liberals against the Bracks government, the federal government's idea appears to be a new federal body to take charge of these sensitive phone-tapping activities, which could also then be used - quote - "if necessary" to investigate corruption. Mr Ruddock has suggested this agency might resemble the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who investigates complaints against our national security services. But are we then really talking about an anti-corruption investigator, or a new 'inspector-general of surveillance'? Wouldn't this really be a new privacy protector, taking over the supervision of phone tap warrants from the Commonwealth Ombudsman? In which case, why not trust the nation's ombudsmen with phone tap powers after all, just like other major investigation agencies - at least in appropriately serious cases?
The second issue gets back to basics - who should investigate corruption, and in particular, can ombudsmen do it? The arguments that they can't, reflect the reality that until recent years, Australian ombudsmen were reactive, even though they had most of the necessary legal power. But then neither did anyone else. Things change, and the federal government itself has already thrashed through this issue. In 1996, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended exactly what the headlines now say - a separate watchdog to handle administrative complaints and anti-corruption work against Federal Police. But the government did not accept that recommendation, preferring instead, for the last 7 years, to let the Commonwealth Ombudsman continue to oversight these issues, even without the necessary resources.
So in fact the federal position for the last 7 years, and the Victorian government's current position, aren't so unreasonable. There is no reason in principle why an ombudsman cannot also function as an anti-corruption commission. In many countries, particularly developing countries with new constitutions, these bodies are being created as one - as integrity commissions with wide-ranging responsibility over corruption and defective administration, wherever these might be found, using whatever information and tools to do the job. This is the model that Australia needs to look at more closely, to achieve a critical mass of skills and experience in such bodies, and make sure the anti-corruption effort isn't unnecessarily fragmented. The Commonwealth and now the Victorian Ombudsman have been moving in this direction... to 've just got a long way to go. Getting the Ombudsman into the role of a general integrity commission faster, is one option that needs to be considered alongside the familiar knee-jerk solution of establishing a new body.
To be fair, President Obama was not alone. Here's George W. Bush with U2 frontman Bono. That snap was posted on the former president's Instagram. On that photo sharing site, where selfies are ubiquitous, there were thousands of pictures with the #mandelaservice.
Unlike the version that Paul W.S. Anderson eventually wrote and directed in 2002, Romero's script was faithful to the game's plot, and featured a menagerie of bizarre creatures (including mutant sharks, giant snakes and a man-eating plant) that gamers had come to love.
As it turns out, Laco's lineage has remained relatively well condensed since Uncle Ludwig retired around the time of the Quartz Crisis, having sold Laco-Durowe to Timex in 1959. Erich Lacher, who replaced Ludwig as Frieda's business partner in 1936, continued to produce watches with his own company, Erich Lacher Uhrenfabrik, maintaining its local reputation as Laco's “little sister.” In 1988, the managing partner of Erich Lacher Uhrenfabrik, a gentleman named Horst Günther, managed to acquire the rights to Laco's name and logo from Timex, thus reuniting the two brands. The company is now run by Mr. Günther's son, Andreas, who seems well dedicated to honoring the company's significant history and making sure that “Made in Germany” continues to really mean something.
As consumers, we have the ability to ensure the incentive for economic solutions related to ghost nets. Because here's what works really well for this issue: net buyback programs. There are companies hard at work training and paying fisherman to reclaim lost gear, and then regenerating the nylon waste from ghost nets into new materials to create products – everything from swimwear to skateboards.
Still, there are plenty of congressional Republicans who want that wall as much as Trump does. And the president's brainless brinksmanship could inspire the House Freedom Caucus, which shares the president's belief that sabotaging the government's capacity to function is a sound strategy for passing contentious legislation. Which is to say: Even if the president isn't actually prepared to trigger a shutdown with a veto, his bluster could inspire Ryan's caucus to shut down the government for him.
While the case against Feldman was dismissed, suits filed by Gauthier against several other defendants, including country star Johnny Reid and the Cowboy Junkies, remain pending. Reid has also filed a countersuit against Gauthier, claiming he was paid only half his $175,000 fee for playing the Picnic. In all, Gauthier was originally seeking some $27 million in damages.
I think one's opinion about this place would really depend on their expectations of the trip. Let me explain: Even though I'm still in my 20's, I can't party until 4 am anymore. I have to go to bed at a reasonable time (11-midnight) if I'm expected to get up at 7 to go floating. I think maybe our friends who planned the trip thought the "party crowd" would only be right along the river. Nope! It definitely extended across the entire lower campground. Even after I went to bed there were people still showing up and setting up their tents RIGHT NEXT to ours and then talking loud until after 3 am. There were definitely people partying until 6. There's a sign that says music has to be off by 11pm ("no exceptions!") but no one abided by or enforced that rule. As you can imagine, even with earplugs in I got very little sleep. So if you are planning on camping here and want to sleep, you need to set up camp by the entrance and NOT by the river. We rented a canoe for our trip and the rest of our group used rafts. The staff managing our rentals was made up of a few boys who couldn't have been older than 16 and basically rushed through the rules he barely remembered and told us to pick up our life vests and oars. One of the rafts had a slow leak and required our friends to bail water out. Our canoe definitely had several leaks that required us to pull over a few times and dump the water out. We try repairing one of the major leaks with melted plastic and seal wax, and surprisingly it worked! But why are we having to do this in the first place? We decided when we hit the first take out we would ask if we could switch out our canoe. When we asked the employee said "Uh, well..." and looked to other employees for an answer. One nodded, but no one helped us locate another canoe. My boyfriend found another one and pointed to it, and an employee said "uh, probably not that one," which suggested to me that this one also had issues. We finally found one that worked and took it and luckily did not have any more leakage issues on the trip. The bus ride back to the camp was a living nightmare. The bus driver said he couldn't take any more people because of the weak transmission of the bus, but then let more people on anyway. We hit tree branches on the way back that broke the top vent of the bus. Along the way, our bus's side hit the side of another one of their busses but we just kept going. No one was injured or anything, but it was a little upsetting at the very least. That all said, I have to say that you get what you pay for. Also, most of the staff was super friendly and helpful, so I cannot complain about that. The bathrooms were clean. I didn't stay long enough to shower so I cannot comment on those. Overall I had an enjoyable time on my float.
Beckner is the first five-star player inked by Missouri since the Tigers garnered a signature from the No. 1 player in the 2012 247Sports Composite in Dorial Green-Beckham. The last five-star defensive lineman the Tigers signed out of high school was Sheldon Richardson, who was the No. 5 defensive tackle in the 2009 247Sports Composite. Richardson failed to qualify, but after joining the team from junior college, became a first-round NFL Draft pick.
The team was renamed the Perfectos, and the sock color was changed to red in 1899. Although all agree the team was universally called the Cardinals since 1900, they disagree on the origin of the nickname. One source says that when newsman William McHale printed a female fan's comment on the uniform change in his column in the St. Louis Republic: “What a lovely shade of Cardinal,” the name stuck. Another claims that the nickname came from the robes worn by cardinals of the Catholic Church.
On Wednesday's Morning Joe, the panel spent a great deal of time covering the recent allegations made by a Democratic Congresswoman from Florida that President Trump was disrespectful to the wife of an American soldier who was recently killed in Niger. Although the liberal politician's account was not supported by independent evidence at the time of the show's airing, host Joe Scarborough and frequent guest Jon Meacham used the story as an opportunity to attack Christians and church leaders from the South who support Trump as soulless hypocrites.
SCARBOROUGH: Let me ask you this, as far as the personal failing goes, ‘cause I got into this yesterday on the show and a little bit after the show. We're from the South. And what at least our generation was taught was constantly being polite. People would come from across the country and all of my friends that would come from the North would say: everybody is so polite; everybody is so kind; people I don't even know come up and say hello to me, take ‘em to church, and they, you know [trails off]. That's what the South had going for it, you know. We have had our problems, but as far as being kind to people that were coming down here, that's what we always took pride in. You know, your parents I'm sure at times, my parents at times, would say: that is not how a Southern gentleman treats a lady; open the door;- MEACHAM: Right. SCARBOROUGH: -you know, walk behind; do this; carry that. [...] [B]ut for yankees, it's hard to know how much that actually is pounded into your head every day. Your friends, there's even peer pressure. You don't talk to somebody that way. And yet, you have the entire South it seems, you have evangelicals especially, despicable pharisees, leaders of the church in the South, kowtowing to this horrific man who has no humanity and is the antithesis of everything we were taught growing up in the South about how you treat other people. MEACHAM: And I think there's gonna be some kind of reckoning. Basically, the Republican Party, a lot of, as you say, a lot of our fellow southerners have sold their soul for temporal power and the check is bouncing.
Last week Nevada Assemblyman Lynn Stewart, Chairman of the Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections, in a rarely seen maneuver, bowed to overwhelming citizen pressures from hundreds of phone calls and emails and from volunteers wearing RED shirts demanding that he not let Nevada's Article V Bill AJR7 die in his Committee without being brought to a Vote.
At the time Chairman Stewart changed his mind and allowed the vote, the Legislative Opinion polling stood at 71% FOR and 29% AGAINST moving AJR7 to the full Assembly floor. Yet, when the vote was taken only two Committee members, Assemblywomen Michele Fiore and Shelly Shelton supported the will of the people of Nevada, while eight -- four Republicans and four Democrats -- voted against. The surprise vote was taken without any Committee discussion and no citizen testimony was allowed.
In the days leading up to today's Committee meeting well over 45,000 Nevadans were reached and national talk show host Mark Levin even made mention of the Chairman's plan to let AJR7 die in his Committee. One might speculate that Chairman Stewart and many on his Committee were bowing to decade's-old fear tactics propagated by those that want to maintain the status quo.

The suspect, 45, forced the homeowner's 30-year-old girlfriend into the house at gunpoint around 12:20 a.m. on the 14900 block of Liberal, near Hayes and East State Fair streets, police said.
Very few details are known about the deaths of Russian journalist Igor Kornelyuk and sound engineer Anton Voloshin, cameraman Anatoly Klyan or photojournalist Andrey Stenin. All of them were killed while covering the often fierce military engagements in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.
First there was the raid in Yemen. On the night of January 29, at the end of Trump's first month in office, one Navy SEAL was killed and three were wounded in a raid on an al Qaeda-affiliated compound in Yemen. A subsequent military investigation found up to a dozen civilians were also killed in the raid. President Trump responded to the news by publicly distancing himself from the operation and blaming the death of Navy SEAL William "Ryan" Owens on his generals. In fact, according to the Congressional staffer who spoke with VICE, the White House had an unusually high level of involvement in the raid's organization. "The process by which that raid was approved and executed wasn't the traditional process that was used by the previous administration or most other administrations," he told me. "It circumvented the Principals Committee at the NSC [National Security Council] and instead it was a hodgepodge of more political actors from the West Wing reviewing and approving that raid." (The White House and Pentagon did not respond to requests for comment for this story, but the thrust of these criticisms was aired in a letter sent by multiple members of Congress to the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in February.)
SAN JOSE – Steve Wozniak, one of the original co-founders of Apple, turned a “fireside chat” at the Embedded Systems Conference (ESC) here Tuesday (May 3) into a spontaneous – and sometimes contradictory – critique of education, particularly math, science and engineering education, even suggesting that the American public schools have outgrown their usefulness.Wozniak, now chief scientist at Fusion-io, described American education as stagnant, obsessed with testing and destructive of creativity. He said children in American schools, crowded into large classes, where they are pressured to complete each inflexible unit in a prescribed time and measured by statewide and national standardized tests. “They're not allowed different ways to think” and kids grow swiftly discouraged.Wozniak, who confessed that he spent some eight years in mid-career “secretly” teaching at the middle and high schools levels, said, “By third grade, teachers can pretty much spot the kids who've given up on education, for life.”Although Wozniak noted that his children had attended public schools, he said, “I actually think home-schooling is very, very good as an alternative.” He encouraged middle-class parents – an accurate characterization of his standing-room audience at ESC – to send their children to private schools because “every year, it seems like it's getting worse.”Ironically, Wozniak later heaped praise on a popular engineering competition for high school students – public and private – called FIRST Robotics, in which students compete for an eventual national championship in robot design. Wozniak has served as a judge for FIRST Robotics competition.“Building something for yourself -- that's the way the mind develops among engineers,” said Wozniak. “If they have it inside of them, that's the one [idea] that's going to last.”In essence, Wozniak's educational views tend to reflect his own experience as a lifelong autodidact, who couldn't really wait to be taught according to any format designed by schools, teachers or even his father, who was a Lockheed engineer.His father, said Wozniak, pitched in and helped when Wozniak threw himself into building, for example, a crystal radio, or winning a science fair. But it was young Wozniak who launched every project on his own, only turning to others for help when his “dream” exceeded his knowledge level.“You've got to be motivated, and the best reasons are internal,” said Wozniak, adding a tongue-in-cheek thumbnail of himself. “It's better if you're not into partying and you don't have much chance of having a girlfriend or a wife.”A self-described “nerd” treated as an “outsider” in school, Wozniak told EE Times' interviewer Brian Fuller that he embraced the independence that his oddball status conferred on him. “That independence made me think I can have very strange dreams, and start to believe that I could achieve some of them.”Indeed, he did just that, serving in the creation of Apple as the nerdy partner to a more outgoing and marketing-oriented Steve Jobs. “I wanted to do engineering, nothing else,” said Wozniak, while Jobs wanted to become “the world's most important person someday.”“I did my best work late at night, alone,” added Wozniak.This streak of iconoclasm clearly colors Wozniak's view of education and embraces his view of management in technology companies. Too often, he said, “creativity gets tamped down” by production deadlines and quarterly earnings goals. He distinguished, in his discussion at ESC, between engineers who essentially follow orders and repeat patterns and the “inventors” who sneak off on their own to-do projects that strike their fancy.Ideally, said Wozniak, “A large company can have little outposts of people” working independently or in small teams, whose imaginations are allowed to run free. “They've got to be isolated from the rest of the company… Let them work on a project of their own. That's a lot more motivating.”Wozniak cited the example of Hewlett-Packard, where – before joining Jobs to start Apple -- he helped engineer that company's hugely successful family of calculators. There, he said, HP's respect for engineers' individuality made the job “the best of my life.”“Everyone who works for a company should be valued,” he said. He pointed out that, when HP fell on hard times, the prevailing corporate ethic dictated that the company keep its workforce intact. Hence, rather than layoffs, HP asked its workers – and got their permission – to accept a temporary across-the-board ten-percent wage reduction and a four-day workweek.“Call it socialism,” said Wozniak. “But I just wish every company could be that way… We all did a little less work and kept everybody in.”It's just as accurate to call Wozniak a socialist or an iconoclast. But the overarching philosophy that shone through Steve Wozniak's ESC fireside chat can be applied equally, and loosely, to public education and private management. Show a little more respect for individual creativity, says “Woz,” and apply a lot less emphasis to standardized measurements.

Hi guys! I hope you're all enjoying your weekend and having fun. I'm honestly trying to take it easy this weekend and catch on some of the packages I received. I love being able work on my passion and have such wonderful followers who are so supportive of what I do. Another passion of mine that you probably wouldn't guess is poker. For a long time, I was considering taking up a professional poker career but it wasn't meant to be. I still have a huge amount of love and respect for the game till this day. So knowing that little bit about me, you guys will understand why I'm extremely excited to show you what I have in store for today. Say hello to the Vegas Baby! Collection by Little Nail Girl . This is a three piece collection inspired by the beautiful sin city.Casino is a pretty clear base glitter topper filled with gold glitter in various shapes. The gold glitz is a lovely representation of where the 'magic' happens. A definite must-have for any collection missing a gold glitter topper. Swatched over Sandstorm by Sally Hansen, used two thin coats, and sealed with a topcoat. While it is a clear topper, you can layer it a couple of times for a fuller look. The photo below this description is a swatch without any base color and using three thin coats. Good formula and consistency, didn't give me any issues with fishing or clumping. I would definitely suggest sealing this beauty with a glossy thick topcoat for a great finish.Showgirls is a clear glitter topper filled with bright pink hexes and other multi-colored glitter. Really like the feminine touch with this one. Made me feel like one of those dolled-up showgirls in Vegas rocking a glitter heavy mani. My only wish would of been for it to have even more pink glitters, but that's just my preference. Swatched over Hey Baby! by OPI, used two thin coats, and sealed with a topcoat. Personally I love how it looks over a bright pink undie, but in case you guys wanted to see, below is a swatch using three thin coats. Formula was pretty good and didn't require me to go glitter fishing for any in particular. If you do decide to use it without an undie then perhaps use four layers for a bit better coverage. Fair warning because anything more than three layers does make any polish crack easier. So keep it thin.The Strip is a sheer glitter topper with with blue and teal glitters of various shapes and sizes. It shouldn't come as a surprise for me to say this, but I'm marking this one as my favorite. Love all the teal things. Out of the three, it has the fullest look when swatched without an undie. Swatched over Let's Get Lost by Essence, used three thin coats, and sealed with a topcoat. As with the others, great formula, consistency, and no need for glitter fishing. Three coats is the ideal number with or without an undie. I have to say, in this case I prefer how the glitter looks on its own and would even say maybe add a very thin fourth coat.Overall Vegas Baby! by Little Nail Girl is a great collection for those among us who are glitter lovers. Very cute and sassy glitter combinations for eye-popping manis. I think all the colors look amazing against my skin-tone, which is a pleasantly surprising (especially with Casino). Great formulas all around with equally good consistency. You can't go wrong with glitters! Vegas Baby! Collection by Little Nail Girl is now available for purchase and retails for $24.00 for the trio.Follow Little Nail Girl Lacquer for sales, new releases, and stock information:

Craft's third novel, "Man Trouble," is scheduled for release in May. The plot revolves around a college professor and romance novelist who goes undercover to seduce a playboy billionaire and turn him into a family man.
Despite concerns from Pier's domineering mother, James and his girlfriend buy a beach house in which they live together. Meanwhile, eccentric director Nicholas Ray casts him in the lead role for Rebel Without a Cause (1955). He once again hopes to impress his father with his rising movie star career in Hollywood, but Winton persists with his indifference. When East of Eden debuts, Warner is furious that he does not show up at the premiere. He considers shutting down production of Rebel Without a Cause, but he drops the idea due to James's praised performance in Eden. Later, he finds out that Warner sided with Pier's mother over his break up with her. She ends up marrying Vic Damone, while James then signs a one million dollar contract with Warner Bros. and is cast in Giant (1956). His mental breakdowns become more apparent when he starts conflicting with director George Stevens.

Pure pragmatism, as opening batsman Michael Yan Hip explained, was behind the switch. “If the weather is decent — and the summer of 2003 turned out to be a hot one — the middle of May to the end of June is when our wickets are usually at their best,” he said. “By the time July comes around and pitches are starting to be reused they tend to go very slow and low. These were exactly the sort of wickets Misbah encountered that year and they would probably have been unlike anything else he'd ever come across.
“Twenty20 cricket has maybe changed that a bit now, batsmen these days just look to get their front leg out of the way and hit it anywhere between straight mid-on and midwicket. But at that time someone who was a classical player like Misbah would often struggle with that type of bowling on this sort of wicket.”
For Kris Steel, making his first appearances in the Penicuik senior team as a thirteen-year-old, studying an international batsman at such close quarters was an unforgettable experience.

Visually, the Resistance pushes all the right buttons for me. Unlike other DZC forces (which very successfully maintain a clear, consistent design aesthetic), the Resistance is a mashup of outdated military hardware that harkens back to Cold-War-era technology (compare the Hannibal to a T-80, a Zhukov to a Gepard AA gun, or a Cyclone to a HIND-D), alongside field-expedient civilian vehicles straight out of the Mad Max films. Though this might sound like a rather ugly combination (and would be, in the hands of a lesser designer), Hawk has managed to pull this mix off beautifully, while also making the faction look and feel like an ancestor of the UCM. The little details like replacement armor plates, exposed engines, and individualized crewmen make them a painter's dream or nightmare, depending on how fiddly you are!

Questioning monogamy is scary! It means you're questioning what you feel about love and sex and how you feel about your body, your relationships and your desires, and how your partner feels about these things for themselves. in a relationship, questioning what you want means questioning if you're wanted. It's not just about my desires. It's about hers, and whether theres'a double-standard at play. You have to be totally honest with not just your girlfriend but yourself. ‘Cause as much as you may not want to watch your girlfriend wanting someone else (or maybe you do), at some point I recognized that I wanted it to.
He has not had any pharmaceutical drugs since early 2013 and relies solely on medical cannabis. His former girlfriend has separated and his two children are not allowed to see him, which is a dreadful consequence of all his problems. He is currently running a property management company in addition to working as a marijuana mentor at CannaConnect, which is a group that focuses on helping veterans obtain medical cannabis and other benefits. Starr comments that ““My life will never be normal. I've come to terms with that,” he said. “But it's as normal as I think it can be.” The trend of people foregoing pharmaceuticals and choosing medical cannabis is surely growing and veterans who suffer from PTSD can be huge beneficiaries of cannabis treatments.
Burke figured this did not portend a long future with Wexler and Atlantic: "Here's the greatest R&B label in the world, and they give me country songs to sing. What are they trying to tell me?."[3] In 2005 Burke recalled: "I started out as a cowboy on Atlantic Records – without a horse! I was the only singing cowboy with a corned-beef-and-pastrami sandwich on white with mayonnaise."[7] Despite his reservations, Burke, "accompanied by smooth backing vocals and an arrangement equal parts Nashville and Nat King Cole, gave it his best."[3] Burke: "I like country music but I don't think it was deliberate. I think it was something we just accidentally happened onto. By my being versatile. By my being able to sing different songs – being able to change my tone quality, having the different octaves. You must remember, I was capable of singing anything." Burke recalled: "They weren't happy with my rendition, because I felt I had to talk. We did it several times and I kept talking on the record. Mr. Wexler said 'I don't think that's gonna work'. At that time Mr. Paul Ackerman and others said 'leave it in. We don't know what we're doing anyway. This is something new we're trying. No black artist has ever done country music before, so let's see what's gonna happen'. That was the turning point of my career – after that, international artist worldwide." When recalling Burke's first recording session at the Atlantic, Wexler added in 2002: "There was a blizzard the morning we were to do the first recording session with Solomon and I didn't know if I would be able to get into New York. The trains weren't running, but I made it in that morning and there was Solomon, who had come up from Philadelphia. We did four songs in three hours, including 'Just Out of Reach'. After we finished recording, I went into the control room to listen to the playback. I looked around for Solomon, but he was heading out the door. He said he had to get back to Philadelphia while it was still light because he had a job shoveling snow. I think he was getting paid $3.50 an hour. He already had something like eight kids."[8] According to Tony Cummings, "Despite the use of a different arranger at each session Solomon conquered all. His rich, vibrant, baritone voice brought the full majesty of the gospel tradition to a series of intense, moody ballads and laid down the solid groundwork of the soon-to-follow soul music explosion.[9]

Other familiar faces on the show include Nana Visitor (Kira from Deep Space 9) as a villain and Grace Park (Boomer from Battlestar Galactica) in a brief spot as another transgenic.
Gordon then played on Derek and the Dominos' 1970 double album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, contributing, in addition to his drumming, the elegiac piano coda for the title track, "Layla". In later years, Whitlock claimed that the coda was not written by Gordon: "Jim took that piano melody from his ex-girlfriend Rita Coolidge. I know because in the D&B days I lived in John Garfield's old house in the Hollywood Hills and there was a guest house with an upright piano in it. Rita and Jim were up there in the guest house and invited me to join in on writing this song with them called 'Time.'... Her sister Priscilla wound up recording it with Booker T. Jones.... Jim took the melody from Rita's song and didn't give her credit for writing it. Her boyfriend ripped her off."[4] Graham Nash (who also dated Coolidge) substantiated Whitlock's claim in his memoir.[5] "Time" was not released by Priscilla Coolidge and Booker T. until 1973, on their album Chronicles.[6]
While on tour with Joe Cocker in the early 1970s, Gordon reportedly beat and injured his then girlfriend Rita Coolidge in a hotel hallway, thereby ending their relationship.[9]
“As long as the Senate requires 60 votes to move legislation, Alex – and this is something the president has tweeted about yesterday, and others, including a good friend of mine, Congressman Trent Franks of Arizona, have been warning about – this is going to be the vehicle that the Democrats will use,” Gaffney agreed. “Yes, they do drive hard bargains, but they also are very disciplined. They are unrelenting, and they're playing to their base to a far greater degree, I think, than Republicans are doing – or at least President Trump is at the moment.”
Shortly after that incident, police raided the HQ of another file sharing website, a private music community called Oink. The site had become well-known for allowing users to access out of print material and pre-release versions of new music - and was even used by musicians including Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, who told New York magazine that he "frequented it quite often".
We're the slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South. We're the ranch hands and cowboys who opened the West, and countless laborers who laid rail, and raised skyscrapers, and organized for workers' rights.
(They flipped Fox to the Tampa Bay Rays with popular third baseman Matt Duffy in the trade that netted left-hander Matt Moore, who filled an important rotation need but has been inconsistent this season.)
The Giants will push up Slater as they try to have a winning June. If they do not, then expect to see pitcher Tyler Beede, third baseman Jae-gyun Hwang and maybe a few more fresh faces.
I spent 22 years in banking in Las Vegas — I guess that means I was somewhat in the bubble business myself. There was a couple in Las Vegas: the gentleman was a house painter and his wife was a hairdresser. One day, a lady came in to get her hair done. The hairdresser mentioned to her, "Gee, you know, I'm really interested in getting into real estate." This was 2004, at the height of the real-estate bubble in Vegas.
Of course, by the time I met Harry's girlfriend at dinner, she was not a schoolteacher anymore. She was now selling real estate for Harry. Is that any wonder in Vegas, during the boom? There were 17,700 real-estate agents: one for every 100 people in the city. It was hard not to have a bunch of friends who were selling real estate. Nowadays, one in every 60 homes in Las Vegas is in foreclosure. Those two numbers are probably connected somehow.
From there, they hit Lollapalooza 1997 (the last original year), but broke up soon thereafter: label woes, vague personal acrimony, the usual. The reunion boasts the “classic” Fantastic Planet lineup: frontman Ken Andrews, fellow songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Greg Edwards, and late-arriving drummer Kelli Scott. Andrews in particular had kept busy in the interim, between side projects (ON, Year of the Rabbit) and studio gigs: He mixed the latest record from Paramore, who've covered “Stuck on You.” Here, he chats with SPIN about the joys of being a “band's band,” the perils of having too much depth, and his dreams of a brighter, larger-font tomorrow.
Red Sox third baseman Kevin Youkilis, who has known Punto for several years, is another believer.
It's not surprising that former Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann is defending Donald Trump. She's a punchline for liberals and basically synonymous with a lack of rational thinking. What's surprising to me is how she's defending him.
The New York Islanders on Friday night selected defenseman Griffin Reinhart with the fourth pick of the 2012 NHL Draft at Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh.
Reinhart (6-foot-3, 206 pounds) plays for the Edmonton Oil Kings in the Western Hockey League. He's the son of former NHL player Paul Reinhart, a defenseman for the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks. Just before the Islanders drafted Reinhart, they made a trade with the Anaheim Ducks to land veteran defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky for a second-round pick in the 2013 Draft.
NHL Central Scouting ranked Reinhart No. 10 among North American central skaters. In three seasons with the Oil Kings, Reinhart has 18 goals, 43 assists and 74 penalty minutes in 105 games. During the Oil Kings' run to the 2011-2012 WHL Championship, Reinhart had two goals, six assists and 20 penalty minutes in 20 games. A physical specimen, Reinhart doesn't have the most upside of other defensemen in the draft, but he is expected to develop into a steady two-way blueliner.
Several members of Fisher's delegation said earlier this week they won't be pushing for Fisher to resign, according to the Daily Sun. “He was freely elected and hasn't broken any laws. I know him well and he's a thoughtful guy,” Belknap County Delegation Chairman Herb Vadney told the Sun.

A 57-year-old Italian conman was recently arrested and charged with fraud and document forgery, after its was revealed that he had been posing as a member of the Montenegro Royal Family for years. His con was so elaborate that he had even managed to fool many real royals and celebrities.
The club needs to infuse some more quality youth into the lineup, just as they did with defenseman Derrick Pouliot.
During the preparation phase, the changeover is prepared. You should have all the tools, the equipment, and the needed manpower ready before you start to ramp down.
From her own 2016 press release:Washington, D.C.– In a long-awaited victory, the U.S. House of Representatives today by a voice vote passed H.R. 3833/S. 1632, legislation introduced by Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson (D-Florida) and Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) to help combat Boko Haram.
The measure directs the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense to jointly develop a five-year strategy to aid the Nigerian government; members of the Multinational Joint Task Force created to combat Boko Haram; and international partners who've offered their support to counter the regional threat posed by the insurgents. […] “Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to ISIS and continues to commit terrible acts of brutal violence against civilians in Nigeria as well as in Chad, Cameroon, and Niger,” said Senator Collins, who authored and originally introduced the bill. “Rep. Frederica Wilson was a willing and able partner in the effort to pass this bipartisan legislation, which requires a five-year strategy to pursue Boko Haram and will bolster U.S. efforts throughout the region. I urge the president to immediately sign this bill into law”, said Wilson. […] “Boko Haram captured my attention and the headlines when the terrorist group kidnapped 276 Nigerian schoolgirls from their dormitory rooms 968 days ago. For most of the world, the Chibok girls symbolize the horror that is Boko Haram, but the damage its members have wrought goes far deeper,” said Congresswoman Wilson.
Miklos Rajna was an important factor in the second period as Germany stepped up its attack and put 14 shots on goal. Germany began sending waves of pressure that kept the Hungarian defencemen on their heels. Rajna had several key saves and a German shot hit the post but the score remained 1-1. German overwhelmingly outshot Hungary in the second period 14-3.
While it was difficult to get an understanding of the offensive line play, there was a reason to be optimistic: a new offensive line coach and some new offensive linemen meant that the 2016 shouldn't look like the 2015 line.
As for Brandon Fusco, he's been a pleasant surprise. There haven't been many tweets about him as the other five linemen at the other four spots have consumed a lot of attention, but that might be a good thing for a guard who looked so bad last year that it was impossible to ignore him. Fusco has had his struggles, especially on twists, but he's been winning a good number of his matchups.
Once again, the worst-performing offensive lineman on the roster is probably Carter Bykowski and he hasn't really improved much over last season to me. Jeremiah Sirles has also performed poorly thus far, which is a sad surprise because of how well received he was by San Diego fans. Maybe his performance in the preseason will make up for it. He seems to be losing to a whole host of defensive linemen, including Scott Crichton, Zach Moore and Danielle Hunter.
If any backup is having a hell of a camp, it's Justin Trattou. It's not difficult to see why Scott Crichton has been relegated to third team end/tackle with the way that Trattou has been playing. Not only is he performing well against Matt Kalil and Jeremiah Sirles, he's been able to play against Andre Smith and interior linemen as well. In all of those circumstances, he's been outperforming the other backup defensive ends and seems to be a consistent rotational guy.
One interesting aspect of the Bermuda Party is that on the day before it is held a very large number of chess wives arrive at the Olympiad, ostensibly because they do not wish to miss the great action, but certainly in many cases to make sure their husbands do not have to go through the ordeal all by themselves. The same applies for female players, with the chess husbands or boyfriends arriving in time to chaperone the ladies to the party.
Stanford's offensive lineman David Bright and tight end Kaden Smith were also named to the first team.
Stanford offensive linemen A.T. Hall and Nate Herbig were named to the second team, as was Utah wide receiver Darren Carrington, whose sister Dijonai plays for the Stanford women's basketball team.
It wasn't simply that these locations were more dangerous, it was that they were darker, grimmer and had ever more sinister implications. They were a metaphor for your own descent into the darkness within and a far cry from the first game's pastoral, romantic and homely beginning. All this coming of age, with its discussion of power and responsibility (and clumsy romance), was oddly familiar to a young man coming to the end of his teens (and united with his girlfriend of the time by a love of the first Baldur's Gate).
Clarke, known for his cowboy hat and no-holds-barred attitude, has been an outspoken social media user and avid supporter of President Trump.

Holtz, former Miami (Fla.) defensive back Tracy Howard, former Sam Houston State defensive back Mikell Everette, former Florida State defensive lineman Nile Lawrence-Stample, former West Virginia defensive lineman Kyle Rose and former Kentucky defensive back A.J. Stamps.

Actress in a new TV series: Sarah Michelle Gellar
Backstage, Howerd was notoriously bold in his advances, and was known for his promiscuity. One of Howerd's former boyfriends was comic actor Lee Young who created the TV sitcom Whoops Baghdad (1973) for him. Howerd's uncomfortable relationship with his sexuality – he once said to Cilla Black, "I wish to God I wasn't gay" – as well as his depressive mental state, led him to seek resolution through a series of different methods. Heymer would often drop Howerd off on Friday at his psychiatrist, who would ply him with LSD over the weekend.[12] This experience was later the subject of the March 2015 BBC Radio 4 drama Frankie Takes a Trip.[13]

Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Tom Wheeler said on February 4 that he backed Obama's plan to reclassify the Internet as a public utility under the government agency's Title II authority. FCC commissioner Ajit Pai said in a press release on February 6 that the plan "marks a monumental shift toward government control of the Internet." Even a liberal think tank predicted that these regulations could cost American households $156 in new fees.
If by snob one means that I condescend to people who neither share my enthusiasm for recorded music nor are able to afford my level of participation in the hobby, then my own answer is clearly No: I don't have it in me to look down on others for such reasons. The thing is, neither do the overwhelming majority of audiophiles whom I've met over the yearseven the ones who are, in other respects, complete idiots. In fact, after decades in this field, I still think the notion of the audiophile who condescends to those who don't own five-figure phono cartridges and coffin-sized speakers is largely a construct of the insecure and the envious. The only condescension I see in this hobby is the sort that's aimed by audiophiles of one camp at audiophiles of anothera childishness that reached its apotheosis in The Flat Response, a wretched fanboy mag of the 1980s in which people who sold gear that wasn't made by Linn or Naim were mocked in a series of amateurish cartoons.
More importantly, however, I think the message that any of you should take away from this other than the fact Canon has clearly hired marketing madmen who aren't in our realm, is that your images are likely not being scrutinized nearly as much as you think. What you spend ages thinking about may be entirely glossed over by someone who isn't a photographer, and to be honest, we're generally not aiming to please other photographers. It's one of the reasons many of us will suggest to you to not worry about having all the most perfect gear, and not get into crazy pixel-peeping because what you're saying in the image will generally cast a shadow on some minor imperfection.
The Fair Tax Act (H.R. 25) was introduced last month by Congressman Rob Woodall (R-GA). It would abolish the IRS, mainly on the premise that the agency would no longer be needed after restructuring the nation's tax system as described in the bill. It would eliminate the income tax and replace it with a national sales tax based on consumption rather than income.
In the end, what emerged from the session was a clear sense of how Republicans could potentially frame this year's midterm elections. Multiple Congressmen rose to hail the president's promises and intentions but argued that he has been ill-served by an obstinate House Democratic leadership, and specifically Speaker Pelosi.
Chairman and CEO, Monsanto "The world's population is expanding fast, but resources are not. To meet this demand sustainably, we must do more with less. The good news is there are solutions, including better seeds, precision agriculture tools and different agriculture systems. So the real question is can we commit to an 'all-of-the-above' approach? If companies, universities, NGOs and farmers work together, we're capable of creating a sustainable food supply for all."
Lawmakers approved AB 2676 which would make it a misdemeanor crime -- punishable by jail time and fines -- to not provide appropriate water or shade to workers laboring under high heat conditions. "The Humane Treatment for Farm Workers Act" -- authored by Assemblyman Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) -- will require agricultural employers to treat farmworkers at least as well as animals. If not, they must face the same criminal penalties as exist in current law for the inhumane treatment of animals. Currently under the law, a person who does not provide water to an animal, could face criminal prosecution.
When we look at the cyclical aspect, 43 years from 1974 (50% of 86-year wave) will be 2017. The previous cycle interval was 1931, when debate on the floor of the Senate echoed words claiming that even a “dictatorship” was better than the pains of depression supporting suggestions of communism or socialism was the way out. Then, the following year, Congressman Louis Thomas McFadden twice introduced impeachment resolutions against President Herbert Hoover.
“Pacific Fishermen understands and shares the social responsibility and importance to the City of helping those experiencing homelessness. We support the Mayor's approach and the use of the Yankee Diner site. If these lots are managed properly, good folks will get the services they need and there will be a reduced impact on businesses,” said Doug Dixon, General Manager of Pacific Fishermen Shipyard, which is located next door to the Yankee Diner site.
Not the hottest of takes, considering playoffs are always a goal for almost every NHL team, but there really is no reason to think the Flyers won't pull it off . The Flyers are younger and more chock-full of potential than they have been in years. Patrick, Oskar Lindblom, and the team's enviable horde of defenseman prospects are sure to invigorate the Flyers' stale lineup. Many of the players that fans believed Dave Hakstol placed too much faith in, such as 5 v. 5 black hole Brayden Schenn and the entire fourth line of Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, Chris VandeVelde and Roman Lyubimov, have been exiled for one reason or another.
Coming soon are two new videos, the first is another progress video showing just how far we've come in the last 4-5 months and the second will be showing off Frigates and their various abilities (fixed weapons, mining) our German friend has been churning out ships like a madman so there's plenty to show off there also, along with the changes to the UI, weapons effects, the huge Outpost model maybe... Well I'm rambling anyway - so just watch this not-so Shallow Space because there is more greatness inbound!
Defenseman Andrej Sustr, an undrafted free agent who just completed his third season with Nebraska-Omaha, has signed a two-year entry-level deal with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
The 22-year-old Czech defenseman is 6-foot-8 and 225 pounds; he had nine goals and 25 points along with 53 penalty minutes in 39 games for UNO this season. He announced he was leaving school after the Mavericks were eliminated from the WCHA playoffs.
“Andre is a big, mobile, right shot defenseman with very good skills. We feel he has great potential to develop into a good NHL player,” general manager Steve Yzerman said in a statement. “We're excited to have him join our organization.”
Boston University defenseman Adam Clendening has signed with the Chicago Blackhawks and will forgo his final two years of school, according to RDS's Renaud Lavoie. Clendening's deal is for three years at $650,000 per season, Lavoie reports.
Clendening's departure leaves BU with five returning defensemen, plus incoming freshman Matt Grzelcyk. The Terriers will almost certainly add another defenseman or two over the summer. One possibility would be Marc Hetnik, who was originally committed for this fall before it was decided that he'd spend another season playing for the Vernon Vipers of the BCHL.
The best part of the evening, though, was reserved for Congressman John Lewis. The 76-year-old civil rights icon didn't hesitate for a second when Colbert said "Do you want to crowd-surf?" at the end of their interview. "Yes," replied Lewis, who was on the show to talk about the third volume of his graphic novel March. Colbert double-checked to confirm by saying "Do you want to jump into the crowd with me?" Lewis nodded, stood up and walked over to the crowd.
The Next Giant Leap for Mankind
7) With Derek Jeter retiring from baseball two years ago, A-Rod going out two weeks ago and David Ortiz leaving the game two months from now, there may be a lot of fans without a favorite player in the sport. If you are such a fan, consider filling that hole with Royals third baseman Cheslor Cuthbert. He's a 23-year old rookie batting .292 with 10 home runs. That covers the baseball part.
No replacement player will be drafted into the squad, meaning Peter Handscomb will keep wickets for the remainder of the series, and young Queensland batsman Sam Heazlett will likely get two further opportunities at international level after his ODI debut on Monday.

And there always seems to be fall speculation the team is shopping Hutton. And there was understandably this week speculation the Canucks would or should be angling to add another defenceman to help weather injuries to Edler and Stecher.
At powwows  there are dozens every year  thousands of Germans with an American Indian fetish drink firewater, wear turquoise jewelry and run around Baden-Württemberg or Schleswig-Holstein dressed as Comanches and Apaches. There are clubs, magazines, trading cards, school curriculums, stupendously popular German-made Wild West films and outdoor theaters, including one high in the sandstone cliffs above the tiny medieval fortress town of Rathen, in Saxony, where cowboys fight Indians on horseback. A fake Wild West village, Eldorado, recently shot up on the outskirts of Templin, the city where Angela Merkel, the chancellor, grew up.
Krol and Lombardozzi are filler pieces essentially. Krol's a hard throwing youngster who fits best as a lefty specialist, and probably shouldn't face good right-handers in critical situations at this point in his career. Lombardozzi's a reserve infielder who isn't much of a hitter and doesn't have enough glove to cover shortstop, so while he's young, the upside is pretty limited. Maybe he grows into his power and develops into an okay second baseman in a few years, but for right now, he's kind of a replacement level bench guy without a ton of value.
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, has introduced a border security bill that requires federal officials to gain "operational control" of the border. Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., is working on immigration enforcement bills, including one to require employers to use the E-Verify electronic verification system to ensure their employees are eligible to work legally in the U.S.
Poor sportsmanship or part of the game? Source: Twitter
So many times though, it is the person you hear people talk about, that has a heart of gold, is the very same person who doesn't even know their own value and understand their worth. David was that way. He didn't know his own value. He wore his heart on his sleeve. The love he yearned for from his mother was non existent to him because she had another child who commanded more of her attention. His father, would only come around only when he needed something. He had girlfriends but those girlfriends didn't really love him for him. He loved the idea of them, but there was no compatibility. He didn't have many friends either. He was an introvert preferring to keep his circle close knit.
This gentleman joined him and as he did, he stared at the water. “It is a beautiful day isn't?”
The gentleman replied with a smirk. “That is the problem I noticed today. So many people have this idea of love, this created illusion of a four-letter word. But not a lot of people take the time to understand it. Not a lot of people have the patience to really search for it. I believe God put us all on an individual treasure hunt. Sometimes you just have to follow the signs, quiet your mind and listen. God always talks son, and when God talks, God guides, and when God guides, just follow his light because his light is always shining on the ultimate prize.”
When David opened his eyes, and looked next to him, that gentleman was gone, there was no one there, just an empty space on the bench as he overlooked the water and the parenting pelicans.
Johnson's more than 500 bronze works -- 350 of which are life-size statues -- include horses, American Indians and other human figures.

Snubbed by her friends; blackmailed by her own cousin brother in an attempt to sleep with her; dumped by her boyfriend for being an “embarrassment” – this is a story of a victim, a University of the South Pacific student.
And all that for a mistake she made three years ago when she faithfully allowed her boyfriend of two years to take an intimate picture of them.
Laurel Healy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) knows the U.S. governmental system has its issues, but when she starts her first job on Capitol Hill, she quickly learns things are much further gone than she realized. Washington D.C. has been invaded by alien bugs that have come to Earth and are dining on the the brains of a growing number of Congressmen and staffers, bringing operations to a standstill, and it's up to her to figure out what exactly is going on and stop it. Among those helping Laurel are Rochelle Daudier (Nikki M. James), a medical resident who lost her father to a mysterious infection, an eccentric scientist named Gustav (Johnny Ray Gill), and Gareth (Aaron Tveit), a smart and hard-working Legislative Director for a crazy Republican senator named Red Wheatus (Tony Shalhoub) .
"Same-sex marriage was not something we promoted internationally. When I spoke out about Uganda, I spoke about a gentleman who was bludgeoned to death with a hammer," the minister said in the interview. "What we've talked about are three things: the criminalization of sexuality; violence against sexual minorities and the death penalty against sexual minorities. I don't know any conservative in Canada who supports any of those three things."
Lewis is alleged to have dragged his girlfriend across the floor and put his hands on her neck.
Former Michigan cornerback Jourdan Lewis' girlfriend accuses him of dragging her across the floor and putting his hands on her neck, according to a police report of the March 15 incident. But he told investigators that he did not assault her.
At 1:10 a.m. March 15, the 20-year-old woman, Lewis' girlfriend of three years, called 9-1-1. She was crying and not answering questions on the phone, so two officers were sent to the home.
Diamond Reynolds, the girlfriend of Philando Castile who witnessed his shooting, said that no one bothered to check his pulse—instead, officers were more concerned with reassuring the cop who killed Castile that everything would be okay (for him).
Every Friday, visitors to the Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond have the opportunity, as I did last week, to meet with some of the original Rosies, now all in their nineties, who are proud to share their riveting stories. As Catherine (Kay) Morrison said of her defense work as a journeyman welder, “We can help our country and ourselves at the same time.” At a time when the minimum wage was 25 cents an hour, Morrison earned $1.38 with her American Bureau of Shipping certificate qualifying her for flat, vertical and overhead welding. After the war was over, the savings these women set aside helped them purchase a first home or a small plot of land for themselves and their growing families.
"They ran a double cut with the third baseman cutting the ball off in the infield to keep it from going home," said Brantley. "There was nobody at third base. We had a race to third and on the way in, [Oakland third baseman Josh Donaldson] kind of stepped on my hand when he went to tag me and I was sliding into third base."
Last season Bourn stole 42 bases, Stubbs 30 and Brantley 12. Second baseman Jason Kipnis stole 31 bases and shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera can run as well.
State Sen. Ben Hueso, D-San Diego, introduced a bill to fund lawyers for immigrants in deportation proceedings, while Assemblyman Rob Bonta, D-Alameda, proposed helping public defenders assess the immigration consequences of criminal convictions.
Republican Assemblyman Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach) responded to the resolutions in a speech accusing Democrats of sowing division and fear:
It's also an open question whether French Catholics — zombie and non-zombie alike — will maintain their own resistance to the National Front's anti-Europe, anti-Muslim, and anti-liberal siren call. Fillon does seem to have harnessed what the religion specialist Henri Tincq calls “identity Catholicism.” Those Frenchmen and women, he said, “uneasy with a modernity that has largely erased Christian values from issues like education, family, work, and sexuality,” and increasingly ill at ease with transnational institutions like the EU and the transnational flow of peoples — especially when they are Muslim and hail from the Middle East — have increasingly been retreating to the ostensible safety of traditionally national institutions like the Catholic Church. Fillon is now offering them what seems to be a compelling political alternative to the sclerotic secularism of the left and unsavory heritage of the extreme right.
Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin's sexual orientation was never really a factor in her victorious campaign against Republican former Gov. Tommy Thompson. Advocates for gay rights see that as a watershed moment for the movement.

LaVine appears to be making great progress and has been doing basketball drills for a while. But doctors believe the 6-foot-7 swingman should wait the full nine months after surgery before returning to full practice.
On our most recent get together a few months ago, I overheard my friends discussing me. Before this incident occurred, the four of us had been on the subject of my love life. My long-time girlfriend and I broke up last year for reasons I won't go into here, but I did go into with my friends back when she and I decided to end things. Not long before my weekend with the guys, she and I got back together and I told them my ex and I were making a go of it again. They didn't say much in response, but I wouldn't have expected them to.
Later that day I stepped out for a walk, but soon realized I'd forgotten my hat, so I returned to the cabin to get it. The moment I opened the door I could hear my friends in the kitchen discussing me. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but I couldn't keep myself from listening, since they were talking about my girlfriend and me. I wouldn't say they were trashing me, but they did make critical remarks about the way I “justify” my relationship and other things about my personality that were unflattering. About five minutes into this, I opened the door and shut it hard so they would know I was there and they stopped talking.
I suggest that you talk to your friends again about what happened, only this time you do it more forthrightly. No doubt, your hurt feelings are lingering in part because you so quickly attempted to brush them aside. Let the dudes in the woods debacle bring you closer to your friends rather than force you apart. Use this awkward experience as an opportunity to clear the air on the subject of your girlfriend and whatever it is your dearest friends think you're justifying about your relationship with her. Tell them how hurt you were to hear what they said. Tell them why you think they are wrong. Tell them why you love your girlfriend and why they should be open to loving her too. Then ask them why they said what they did about you and her and do your best to listen.
Your choice of romantic partners is none of their business, it's true, but the reason they have an opinion about it is because they want you to have a good life. They know you. They have listened to what you've told them about your relationship with this woman and they've made their own observations. I'm not suggesting that you dump your girlfriend because your friends don't like her, but rather that you hear what they have to say. Perhaps they have a negative opinion of her because when you broke up with her and shared the story of that break up with your friends you cast her in an inaccurately unflattering light. Perhaps they simply don't know what they're talking about and you need to set them straight. Perhaps they see something you cannot see right now, blinded as you may be by desire for this relationship to work.
By January 1961, Eisenhower had warned his successor John F. Kennedy that Laos was the most pressing foreign policy issue in the world and he had initiated Operation Momentum in Laos, for the CIA to train and arm a small force of Hmong tribesmen to fight the communist Pathet Lao and their North Vietnamese supporters.
In another account, after Muhammad and his followers had attacked, plundered, and massacred a number of non-Muslim Arabs and Jews, the Jews and Arabs assembled, poised to annihilate the Muslims, to try to neutralize the Muslims once and for all (at the Battle of the Trench, 627). But then Naim bin Mas'ud, one of the leaders of these "confederates," as they became known in history, secretly went to Muhammad and converted to Islam. The prophet asked him to return to his tribesmen and allies — without revealing that he had joined the Muslim camp to try to get the Jews and Arabs to abandon the siege. "For," Muhammad assured him, "war is deceit."
White House spokeman Bill Burton said President Barack Obama had called Mr Carter from Air Force One to see how he was doing.
Since the time I wrote the review, the desire for shooters to utilize tripod has also expanded to a form of marksmanship exercise. Shooters want to learn and develop their skills shooting off of a tripod in order to enhance or otherwise expand their marksmanship capabilities. This is particularly true for shooters who are already proficient in the prone position, and want to challenge themselves further.
There are several reasons why the Really Right Stuff BH-55 is a superior ballhead than the Manfrotto 488RC2. The quality control and craftsmanship of the BH-55 is impeccable. The load capacity is 50 lbs vs 17.6 lbs.
The former president is at his best when he can play the role of elder statesman and “explainer in chief,” as he did during his well-received 2012 Democratic National Convention speech. But he also has a history of losing his composure in the face of attacks that get under his skin, with sometimes damaging consequences. As Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign stumbled, for instance, the Obama campaign intentionally needled her husband, provoking him to make angrily respond in a series of comments that led to allegations of racial insensitivity and more.
As several government agencies are engaged in cleaning up the shoreline following the oil spill after two ships collided near the Kamarajar Port recently, the Coast Guard today said nearly 40 tonnes of oil sludge and 27 tonnes of oil mixed with water were collected so far. As many as 1,025 personnel from various departments were involved in the clean-up of the shoreline, Coast Guard said in a release."As on date, approximately 40 tonnes of oil sludge and 27 tonnes of oil and water mixture were collected and was being dispatched to Kamaraj Port Trust," the release said.Meanwhile, Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar and senior government officials inspected the area after reports emerged that people feared to buy seafood as several fish were dead due to the incident.Responding to a query, Mr Jayakumar said, "It is not true. People need not fear to consume fish."It is our duty to allay such fears. Therefore, we took some samples of the dead fish taken from Ennore, Marina, Thiruvanmiyur areas. There were reports of oil slick. The results from laboratory have clarified that it is safe to consume," he told reporters.Coast Guard helicopters which were carrying out regular sorties for continuous monitoring of the oil slick identified "stagnated thick oil slick about 100 metres wide near Ennore and 500 x 500 metres near Kasimedu harbour".Coast Guard ship Varada along with a helicopter integrated with pollution control equipment has sailed to clear the oil slick.Coast Guard and various personnel from Fire and Rescue department, Chennai Port Trust, Kamaraj Port Trust, Chennai Corporation, Highways, Chennai Metro Water were involved in cleaning up operation.Volunteers from various engineering colleges, fishermen communities have also joined the cleaning operations. The incident took place on January 28 when 'M T BW Maple', with a flag of 'Isle of Man', was leaving after emptying Liquefied Petroleum Gas and M T Dawn, Kanchipuram, loaded with petroleum oil lubricant, was on its way to berth at the Ennore port.
A Colorado native, Garland was a defensive lineman for four years at Air Force Academy from 2006-09. In April 2010, the Broncos signed Garland as an undrafted rookie free agent knowing that he would have to serve at least two years in the Air Force.
Garland spent the 2012 season as a defensive lineman on the Broncos' practice squad. He was part of the scout team and also stood in as an offensive lineman. Before the 2013 season, the Broncos moved Garland, who is 6-foot-5 and is listed as 308 pounds, to offensive guard. He spent last season again on the practice squad.
It is a pity that Sonoda is no longer with us, that she cannot speak to the president and share with him her memories, tell him that there is no recovering from such devastation, that some things are not to be used for rhetorical ends, that they must, in the name of humanity, be placed beyond the gamesmanship of bullies.
On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement that “four wireless providers are good for American consumers.” That position might or might not change after a new president is elected in 2016, but a big shift in the market might affect it, too, Sharma said.
Crosby was injured when he was cross-checked in the head by Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen 5:24 into the first period of a 3-2 overtime loss in Game 3 on Monday.
The Penguins were already missing defenseman Kris Letang following season-ending neck surgery and goaltender Matt Murray, who sustained a lower-body injury in warmups before Game 1 of their first-round series against the Columbus Blue Jackets.
"I watched the workmen attach that cladding", said Mr McCullough.
The second-team All-Pro defensive lineman is getting fed up with the all-talk, little-action routine.
Tampon talk: The teenager said that boys should think of their mothers, sisters, and girlfriends when making the decision to carry around pads or tampons
He continued: 'If you have a girlfriend are a friend with a girl, u should know that they do not always have tampons or pads on them, or that sometimes their period just hits them without notice ... We should support them with this, after all, we don't have to go through all they do because of menstruation [sic].'
Granted, it looks different, but that is unavoidable in context of what I am trying to achieve. However, I believe the design is elegant and the playing attributes are exactly the same as the traditional form. The changes I have made will be considered radical by some, if not many. On the other hand, the rational argument should be to judge all instruments by the way they sound, the way they play and the craftsmanship according to the beholder. Ok, the changes I have made are radical. Below are some of them and the myths that have maintained the attributes of the traditional form for hundreds of years.
The Riders also announced 19 additional cuts on Saturday ahead of the 10 p.m. deadline. Veteran running back Anthony Allen, offensive lineman Jarriel King and another quarterback in Bryan Bennett were among those released along with receivers Joe Craig and Thomas Mayo.
The one free agent the Bucs must absolutely cut ties with is offensive lineman Oniel Cousins. The former Cleveland Brown is nothing short of a liability on the field, no matter what position he plays. Keeping him on the roster would signal to the free-agent market that the Bucs are incapable of self-scouting.

Jaques, who has been in charge of the Bulls for the past two seasons, enjoyed a productive stint as mentor, overseeing a young squad and most notably playing a key role in the Test selection of batsmen Matthew Renshaw, Joe Burns and Usman Khawaja.
The former Test batsman will return to the Blues - where he worked previously as assistant and batting coach - under current head coach Trent Johnston.
Gus Triandos (July 30, 1930 – March 28, 2013) was a Greek American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball mostly as a catcher but also played as a first baseman for the New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles and the Detroit Tigers of the American League and the Philadelphia Phillies and Houston Astros of the National League.[1] A four-time All-Star, he batted and threw right-handed.
Born in San Francisco, California, Triandos was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1948.[2] He joined the Yankees' major league roster briefly as a 22-year-old in 1953, but was sent back to the minor leagues in 1954. Triandos was traded to the Baltimore Orioles in 1955 where he played mostly as a first baseman for his first two years with the team, before becoming the Orioles' regular catcher in 1957. As the Orioles' catcher, he used an outsized catcher's mitt designed by manager Paul Richards to handle the unpredictable knuckleball of Hoyt Wilhelm.[3] Triandos was behind the plate when Wilhelm threw a no hitter against the New York Yankees on September 20, 1958, and also scored the only run of the game when he hit a home run in the eighth inning.[4] Triandos said catching for Wilhelm was incredibly taxing, telling a reporter, "Wilhelm nearly ruined me."

“In the implementing of their policies, our western partners– the United States first and foremost – prefer to be guided not by international law, but by force. They believe in their own ‘exceptionalism', that they are allowed to decide on the fate of the world, and that they are always right.” – Russian President Vladimir Putin “What did we do to deserve this? What did we do to deserve to be bombed from planes, shot at from tanks, and have phosphorous bombs dropped on us? ….That we wanted to live the way we want, and speak our own language, and make friends with whom we want?” – Alexander V.

Baseball guys aren't necessarily known for their exuberance. Not much showmanship to go around. How many Lou Piniellas you see tossing bases anymore? How many times does Baker need to be ejected to prove he cares? What look does Brandon need to wear to show you he cares? If he smiled during this skid, does that change your opinion? Should every guy be launching their bat in frustration? Maybe dropping a few expletives that you'd find in a New Jersey bathroom stall. Does that illustrate effort?
Last spring, the state transferred the responsibility of policing Camden from the city to the county. It seems to be helping. More officers have been hired and manpower is up about 30%, according to chief Scott Thomson.
When the news of Matt Lauer's dismissal from NBC broke, President Trump used it as an opportunity to attack NBC News and network Chairman Andrew Lack.
In the real game of football, the element of luck is undeniably a factor. Keepers making howling errors, linesmen missing offsides, beach balls from the crowd entering the field… luck is part of the game.
Even now, with roving immigrant rape gangs looting their way across European cities with impunity, women are adamant that they should not have to change their behaviour. It has become a sacred cow of the modern West that women should be able to do whatever they want and live free of any consequences. Women want to dress promiscuously in culturally enriched city centres, and they also insist any and all desert tribesmen should be welcomed into our nations. You can't indulge these conflicting ideologies simultaneously without serious consequences. We warned them about this and they called us fascists for it. If you've done the time anyway maybe you should do the crime.
PIA Spokesman Daniyal Gilani confirmed there were 48 passengers, five crew members and one ground engineer on board.
PIA Chairman Azam Saigal, addressing a press conference on Wednesday evening, confirmed that all onboard have been killed in the crash.

It's amazing how much money passionate hobbyists will spend. Mountain bikers will drop hundreds on lightweight accessories to shave a few pounds, and avid fishermen will invest tens of thousands of dollars in boats and related accessories.
But those old linebackers had to be persuaded, too. Sometimes, Carson said, Belichick would draw plays on the board — rushing two defensive linemen and dropping nine, for example — that players thought would never work.
Parents and community members are urging the Ministry of Education to push for sweeping change within the troubled York Region District School Board, including the dismissal of its director of education and hiring a public ombudsman to deal with complaints. The recommendations come as ministry investigators wrap up their investigation of the scandal-plagued board.
On December 31, 2016, Garrett announced his decision to forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the 2017 NFL Draft. He was projected to be a top ten selection and was ranked No. 1 on ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr.'s big board.[31] Garrett attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and completed the majority of combine drills, but opted to skip the three-cone drill and short shuttle. Garrett solidified his position as a top ten with an impressive combine performance. His 41” vertical jump was the top performance of all defensive linemen and he also finished with the second best performance in the bench press and broad jump. Garrett also had the third fastest 40-yard dash of all defensive linemen at the combine, which highly impressed scouts due to his size.[32] On March 30, 2017, Garrett attended Texas A&M's Pro Day and chose to perform the 40-yard dash (4.65s), 20-yard dash (2.71), 10-yard dash (1.57s), and broad jump (10'6”).[33]
DISLIKE: “Bond tires to transform into a Japanese fisherman but he ends up looking like Spock. This is why I only do mustaches.”
There are several explanations for how the fullback became the NFL's version of the human appendix. When Cookie Gilchrist and Jim Brown were stars, they were as big and as strong as many of the opposing defensive linemen they faced. The graph below shows the average weight since 1960 for all running backs (this includes halfbacks, tailbacks, and fullbacks) in blue, all linebackers in orange, and all defensive linemen in red:
The increase in the size of defensive linemen has made running up the middle less attractive. And now that passing is more effective than ever — i.e., there are fewer sacks, fewer incomplete passes, and fewer interceptions — a run up the middle is a less useful alternative. The rules changes and innovations in the passing game have essentially resulted in mass layoffs for fullbacks.
All the girls in the TSL office are swooning over ultimate Instagram couple @beccabeczten and her incredibly talented boyfriend @jeraldsaw. Talk about #CoupleGoals…
Whether you're a boyfriend looking to please a very grumpy girlfriend, an exasperated girlfriend hoping to improve her boyfriend's photography, or just a girl wanting to look fly as hell - here are 10 easy tips to help you up your #OOTD game at these Insta-worthy spots around Jurong Point!
We've also included the difference between a Basic Boyfriend and a heavenly Instagram Boyfriend. Which are you?
The sure signs of a Basic Boyfriend is one who shoots without thinking. He hasn't even heard of the word ‘composition' before, and thinks photobombers actually give life to a picture. He's probably not likely to even notice until his girlfriend gets pissed after viewing his shots.
The Instagram Boyfriend
The mark of a true Instagram Boyfriend is one who has a good eye for detail. He sees what a Basic Boyfriend can't - like those beautiful palm trees and lush green foliage in the background. Nuff' said.
The Instagram Boyfriend
The Instagram Boyfriend uses works with whatever he's given and plays it to his advantage. Take this normal-looking Korean restaurant for instance - now this looks like a print ad. You'll make your girl look like a KPOP superstar even if she's all sweaty from a yoga class or an indoor football game with you and the boys.
If the girlfriend says she's in Japan, she IS in Japan. Do you panic and give up? NO. You whip out that camera and say, “Hey babe, I got this”. It's not impossible, all you have to do is keep an eye out for elements that create a certain mood or evoke certain feelings within you.
While this might pass off as a good attempt, your girlfriends won't be impressed. The Basic Boyfriend only shoots in one mode, and that's wide angle. Just because there are other things going on, that doesn't mean you can't get a good clean shot. See those slim pillars at the side of the corridor? Use them to your advantage!
The Instagram Boyfriend
A keeper of an Instagram Boyfriend would even hide behind a pillar to make you his highlight. Congratulations, you've successfully teleported your girlfriend from Jurong to Japan. This is what we call DEDICATION. Heck, he might even go as far as manually remove passersby with a beauty app like Mei Tu Xiu Xiu and its acne removal function.
A Basic Boyfriend misses the whole point of his girl's outfit, and makes a huge mistake like cropping out her brand-new kicks. I mean, she just spent her month's salary on them and you just cropped them out of the frame. Well done mate.
The Instagram Boyfriend
Your girlfriend looking like she's advertising for the bank - nope, not what she asked for.
The Instagram Boyfriend
The Top Down is like the #OOTD sister of ‘flat lay', only more intensive because you are dealing with a full-sized human now. Try not to drop your camera on her, you don't want to lose your girlfriend (physically and emotionally) after this shot. #justsaying

Alongside its central image of a knicker-flashing glamourpuss in the path of a tidal wave, the resulting cover was awash with reference points. ‘Peart', ‘Lee' and ‘Lifeson' [nods to the drummer, frontman Geddy and guitarist Alex] are just visible on signposts in the distances. The waves, both in the model's hair and the tsunami – were obvious visual allusions to the album title.

"All I could make out in their language were the words Mr. Bean. They were laughing at me ... making me feel about three inches tall." That was the lament of Arthur Batchelor, a 20-year-old seaman seized in 2007 by Iranian guards in disputed territorial waters on the Iran-Iraq border and held for 12 days along with 14 other British service personnel. In a newspaper interview, Batchelor also confided that he'd "cried like a baby" during his captivity.
When no one arrests corrupt politicians, out politics will be full of shit. When we as a society in toto put the onus of confronting corruption onto a small group of people who are legally subservient to the corruptocrats, and then refuse to either call for those arrests or to support the watchmen when those arrests are actually made, then we are Free Riders.
What they really mean, she says, is, “Send me a veteran with a visible disability,” and yet “many servicemen and women return from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder.” Employers tell her, “I don't know how to accommodate something like PTSD; the veteran may not be able to handle my stressful work environment.” Very few companies, Ms. Bender points out, have a stress level like the one that caused the PTSD.
"Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it" (St. Luke 11:28), He is clearly raising the minds of His listeners to a higher degree of veneration for His mother: she is blessed not only for hearing Him in the flesh, but even more for being who "hears the word of God and keeps it." When our Lord extends the concept of spiritual kinship to all those who "do the will of God," (St. Mark 3:34) He does not deny such a higher kinship to His own family; we know of several of His kinsmen who were Apostles (James, Jude, Simon), and especially "blessed" in this spiritual kinship, of course, was His own mother, of whom alone does the Scriptures say that "all generations shall call me blessed" (St. Luke 1:48). Again, when a certain woman praises His mother for being the one who bore Him, and our Lord says,"Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it"(St. Luke 11:28), He is clearly raising the minds of His listeners to a higher degree of veneration for His mother: she is blessed not only for hearing Him in the flesh, but even more for being who "hears the word of God and keeps it."
The race was tighter between Clinton and Trump in two recent polls commissioned by the S.C. Democratic Party. In a late August poll conducted by the Feldman Group, Trump and Clinton were tied with 39 percent of the vote each in a four-candidate field. A Public Policy Polling (PPP) poll released earlier that month showed Trump ahead by 2 percentage points, 41 percent to 39 percent, in a four-candidate field, within that poll's margin of error. S.C. Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore referred to the PPP results as "surprising" but dismissed the Feldman poll as "bogus." The S.C. Democratic Party touted the poll results as evidence the state could turn blue much sooner than anticipated.
How about this: Someone enlisted none other than author and comic book legend Neil Gaiman to help him propose to his girlfriend during a book signing. Gaiman wrote “Will you marry Jason?” when he signed her book, but the girl in question was so star-struck that the author had to point it out to her three times before she actually noticed what it said.

Love them or hate them, the Westboro Baptist Church knows how to market itself. The WBC has harnessed the power of its infamous over-the-top funeral protests of military servicemen (and women) into financial success. They're able to spend $200,000 per year in travel expenses, thanks in part to successful lawsuits and self-funding. With just 40 members, the supposed non-profit organization, led by minister Fred Phelps, has taken its extreme stance against homosexuality and ignited reactions resulting in financial gain. The WBC, which practices out of Topeka, Kansas, has sued its home city successfully, and is currently seeking an additional $100,000. They've also used their events to get hundreds of mentions on the news and land appearances in several documentaries.
His girlfriend said Beard had bought the handgun several weeks earlier to protect against a break-in.
Recently, the Jordan Peele written/directed movie “Get Out” has garnered rave reviews, media buzz and a breakout star in Chicago's own Lil Rel Howery. “Get Out” is the story of a young, Black photographer named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) who heads to a secluded suburban neighborhood to meet his white girlfriend Rose's (Allison Williams) family... and everything isn't as it seems. It's a brilliant thriller with a satirical spin, and its commentary on race relations ― plus the fact that the villains are white and oppressive in nature ― have naturally caused the same white moviegoers who've spent the past four months saying “get over it” or calling people “snowflakes” to complain that “Get Out” is “racist against white people.”
Okay, imagine if the Hunch Punch had a different effect on him, like in the Tuskegee experiments... oh, you didn't study that? Um... so, like, remember the story of the white lady who lied and said 14-year-old Emmett Till catcalled her, and then her boyfriend tortured and murdered him? No, not that one either, huh. Well, remember that episode of “Saved By the Bell” where Lisa finds out her ancestors were slaves, and Jesse finds out her ancestors were slave traders and then spends the rest of the show being super white guilt-ish and offering to buy Lisa a Coke and stuff?
Playing Skyrim in November 2011 felt like joining an expedition into the unknown. We were experiencing strange things for the first time and excitedly sharing them. Rumours abounded.

Boldin, of course, isn't directly coached by Tomsula, who is very demanding of his defensive linemen. Tomsula has been the tone-setter for a position group that's known physicality and intense early offseason workouts: “Oh, yeah,” Tomsula said of his defensive linemen during the 2013 season, “they're in here puking in March.”

Jackalopes possess an uncanny ability to mimic human sounds. In the old West, when cowboys would gather by their campfires to sing at night, jackalopes would frequently be heard singing back, mimicking the voices of the cowboys. Jackalopes become especially vocal before thunderstorms, perhaps because they mate only when lightning flashes (or so it is theorized).
Text copyright © 2006 Alex Boese The jackalope is an antlered species of rabbit, unfortunately rumored to be extinct, though occasional sightings of this rare creature continue to occur, suggesting that pockets of jackalope populations continue to persist in its native home, the American West.The jackalope is an aggressive species, willing to use its antlers to fight. Thus, it is also sometimes called the "warrior rabbit."Jackalopes possess an uncanny ability to mimic human sounds. In the old West, when cowboys would gather by their campfires to sing at night, jackalopes would frequently be heard singing back, mimicking the voices of the cowboys. Jackalopes become especially vocal before thunderstorms, perhaps because they mate only when lightning flashes (or so it is theorized).When chased, the jackalope will use its vocal abilities to elude capture. For instance, when chased by people it will call out phrases such as, "There he goes, over there," in order to throw pursuers off its track. The best way to catch a jackalope is to lure it with whiskey, as they have a particular fondness for this drink. Once intoxicated, the animal becomes slower and easier to hunt.Jackalope milk is particularly sought after because it is believed to be a powerful aphrodisiac (for which reason, the jackalope is also sometimes referred to as the 'horny rabbit'). However, it can be incredibly dangerous to milk a jackalope, and any attempt to do so is not advised. A peculiar feature of the milk is that it comes from the animal already homogenized on account of the creature's powerful leaps. Douglas, Wyoming has declared itself to be the Jackalope capital of America because, according to legend, the first jackalope was spotted there around 1829. A large statue of a jackalope stands in the town center, and every year the town plays host to Jackalope Day , usually held in June. Jackalope hunting licenses can be obtained from the Douglas Chamber of Commerce, though hunting of jackalopes is restricted to the hours of midnight to 2 a.m. on June 31.Douglas Herrick, a long-time resident of Douglas, Wyoming, is often credited with popularizing knowledge of the Jackalope. In the 1930s Douglas and his brother Ralph began selling mounted Jackalope heads to the public, and these became wildly popular. Examples of their work can be found in many bars and homes throughout the United States. Jackalope postcards also became a popular Western souvenir. Douglas Herrick died on January 6, 2003 at the age of 82.The jackalope is now most commonly sighted in the states of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. However, the jackalope does appear to have a European cousin, which in Germany is known as the wolperdinger. In Sweden, a related species is called the skvader
5. Anne Hathaway and her boyfriend used to frequent a coffee shop I worked at. This was a year or so after Les Mis and around the time where, she admitted later, she was going through severe depression. She wouldn't talk to us or anything. She would come in, sit down and have her partner order for her while she just sat there and looked upset. At the time we just thought she was being stuck up. It just goes to show that you never know what a person is going through and I shouldn't be too quick to judge. Once I read her interview regarding her depression I felt like such a dick.
American anti-abortion advocates say they would target abortion providers instead of women, because it's apparently more acceptable to throw doctors in prison for providing care that saves women's lives every single day. Even if you think that sounds OK, it belies an ignorance of how illegal abortion often works. Trained clinicians able to provide safe and legal abortions, like we have at women's health clinics across America, are luxuries unimaginable to many women worldwide. Today, in places where abortion is outlawed, there are still some illicit providers who offer surgical abortions. But more often there's no trained doctor at all: There's a sister, a mother, a friend, a classmate, a friendly pharmacist, who helps to get misoprostol or other abortion-inducing pills into the hands of a pregnant woman. When these pills are legit and the woman adheres to protocols for misoprostol use approved by the World Health Organization, these clandestine abortions are often very safe and effective, which is why far fewer women die of unsafe abortions today than they did two decades ago. Other times, though, there's the woman who throws herself down the stairs, or asks her boyfriend to punch her in the stomach, or takes a tincture or tea her auntie says will make her period come, or inserts a stick or a knitting needle or a fireplace poker into her vagina.
He glared at Rex W. Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, from behind his committee nameplate, his boyish face just a pinch more weathered than it used to be. He checked off the grievous offenses of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia with prosecutorial zeal, pressing Mr. Tillerson to brand Mr. Putin a war criminal and acknowledge the mysterious deaths of his political opponents.

While Strub is the point man for Hollywood in the Pentagon, usually the scripts come to his colleagues on the other side of the country, in Los Angeles. They work in a nondescript office block along downtown Wilshire Boulevard, in departments belonging to the different service branches of the U.S. military — Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard and Marines. They serve tours of duty for several years, just like their fellow troops, but their task is singularly different: to study film and television scripts producers have sent them in the hope the Department of Defense will help them with their project. The U.S. military has had a presence in Hollywood since the early 1900s. “It's not like they're some surreptitious, hidden, secret-propaganda arm,” said Todd Breasseale, a retired Army liaison officer who did a tour in the L.A. office. “The Army's been there since Hollywood was first built from the Los Angeles canyons and desert.” The Pentagon liaison officers in Los Angeles primarily provide expertise for films, but they also lend their expertise to television shows, documentaries, and video games. But all their support is conditional. Capt. Russell Coons, director of the Navy Office of Information West, said that his office turns down 95 percent of what comes in. “Because in most cases it doesn't represent our core values,” Coons said. “We're not going to support a program that disgraces a uniform or presents us in a compromising way.” Generally, the Navy, like the other service branches, will only endorse scripts or productions that showcase U.S. military values that the Pentagon wants to promote: honor, courage and commitment. “Top Gun,” for example, the 1986 film about a cocky young pilot made good, starring Tom Cruise, used Navy crewmen as its pilot and aircrew onboard at least two aircraft carriers, one in San Diego and one in the Pacific Ocean. Ironically, the Air Force received a massive boost in recruitment, even though it had nothing to do with the film. “The public doesn't always discern the difference on the outside between the Navy and the Air Force,” Coons explained. “But it was also the single biggest boost to the Navy fighters ever.” “What's interesting about ‘Top Gun' is it's a typical 1930s movie: boy chases girl, gets a few flight scenes. You had all the ingredients of the typical Hollywood movie,” said Lawrence Suid, the author of “Guts and Glory: The Making of the American Military Image in Film,” who has been writing about the military and Hollywood since 1975. “In the end everyone is happy. The last shot is of people on the aircraft carrier, and everyone is cheering.” Suid coined the phrase “mutual exploitation” when he first stumbled onto the U.S. military-Hollywood connection. “I was teaching the history of the Vietnam War, and I couldn't explain how we got into Vietnam. I could give the facts, the dates, but I couldn't explain why,” he recalled. “And when I was getting my film degrees it suddenly occurred to me that people in the U.S. had never seen the U.S. lose a war, and when [President] Johnson said we can go into Vietnam and win, they believed him because they'd seen 50 years of war movies that were positive.” Each side, Suid said, benefits from this arrangement. The U.S. military gets incredible publicity and recruitment advantages, and the film industry gets equipment, locations and authenticity. “The relationship goes back as far as 1910, 1911,” Suid explained. Back then it focused on things like the filming of an air show or movies about World War I. The connection was really cemented with the 1927 film “Wings.” The movie featured over 3,000 infantrymen as extras, plus military pilots and planes from the U.S. Air Force, and it starred Clara Bow, the original “it” girl, as the love interest two men fight over, enlisting in an effort to become combat pilots to win her affection. It won the first Oscar for Best Picture. “It was a huge critical success and a financial success,” Strub said. “The reason for that is the unparalleled authenticity the filmmakers were able to achieve by virtue of the fact that the Army Air Corps gave them a lot of access.” After World War II, the collaborations continued, and the Pentagon specifically requested Hollywood to make a film, Suid said, about Wernher von Braun, a Nazi rocket engineer who helped develop Nazi Germany's rocket program. He was later arrested by the Gestapo and eventually surrendered to the Americans and was brought to the U.S., where he worked on military rocket programs. “At one point the Army asked the film industry to make a movie about him showing him as an American hero,” Suid said. The film was called “I Aim at the Stars,” and it was released in 1960.

Comments by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas appeared to show he leaned toward regulating Internet service providers (ISPs) more strictly under Title II of the U.S. communications law, as Obama has suggested.
On both the batting and bowling fronts, India will have a lot of things to look at, keenly. Apart from Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Murali Vijay, the other batsmen had quite a torrid time in the English and Australian tours that have taken place in the past 12 months. Someone like Cheteshwar Pujara, who was billed as Rahul Dravid's replacement, lost his place in the side towards the end of the Australian Test series, following a poor run of form which spanned over seven Tests.

There are other options at defenseman on the market than Dan Girardi. The Bruins could go out and acquire some cheaper options like former Bruin and current Winnipeg Jet Mark Stuart. With the Winnipeg Jets falling further and further out of the picture and with a new head coach, the team could very well part with some players and why not Mark Stuart? Another option could be the Carolina Hurricanes' Ron Hainsey who has spent time playing under Claude Julien when Julien was the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens. Hanisey would fit in perfectly with Julien's defensive style of playcalling.

"It was like if I was to get up shake your hand and sat back down. That's how fast it happened," Reynolds recalled. "All of a sudden we heard a gun go off and the next minute I realized my girlfriend was bleeding. Then I sat down and realized I was shot too."
"I just took action right away," Reynolds said. "I was more worried about my girlfriend than myself and anything else that was going on. And my son because I didn't know if he had shot himself or not. He was shocked and crying. It was traumatizing."
In the short film's extended prologue, Michael's moonlit date with his girlfriend (played by model Ola Ray) is interrupted by his sudden transformation into a howling werewolf. While the “real” Michael and Ola, observing the scene in a movie theater, walk home from the their date, Michael teases her by singing the verses of “Thriller.” Afterward, a horde of zombies rises from their graves, threatening the couple. Michael soon turns into a zombie himself, and leads the troupe in an incredible choreographed dance routine to the rest of the song. Afterward, Michael and the zombies corner Ola in an abandoned house, only for her to realize it was all a nightmare—though Michael offers a last, beast-eyed glance at the camera before the credits roll.
SUNDAY: The Rockies are ready to part ways with Jeremy Guthrie and have informed the rest of the league that the right-hander is available immediately, tweets Buster Olney of ESPN.com. Count the Blue Jays as one of Guthrie's potential suitors as Toronto has contacted Colorado to discuss the framework of a possible deal, report Ken Rosenthal and Jon Paul Morosi of FOX Sports. One trade scenario would have the Jays assuming a major portion of Guthrie's contract as the Rockies would receive only a lower-tier prospect such as Double-A first baseman Mike McDade.
We keep putting it in the budget and they decide to do something else. Congressman Bob Brady
Congressman Bob Brady helped pay for the last dredging with an earmark. Congressional earmarks were banned in 2010 — in part because of scandals involving former Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha — leaving Brady with less power to secure funding. He said he has requested money for the project the last few years, but the Corps of Engineers has used up its budget on other projects.

Commenting on the end of an era rich in celebration of Richard Burns' life, his former girlfriend and RBF Trustee, Zoe Scott said, “The Richard Burns Foundation was some small answer to the large question posed by Richard's untimely death. I am proud of what our volunteers, charity partners, corporate patrons and ultimately our donors have achieved in Richard's name over the past eleven years. It is now an appropriate juncture to call time on our work, celebrate what has been achieved in his name and pass the baton to Spinal Track, a brilliant and fitting initiative that really does have the power to change lives. I am confident that it is something of which Richard would have approved and we wish Nathalie and Andrew the very best.”

My santa sent me the perfect snacks from Iceland! A bag of "3 Sambo Pristur" chocolates with licorice inside and a bag of EG Fiskverku harðfiskur... hard fish. I wasn't so sure about licorice with chocolate but they were delicious. The chocolates almost all got ate in 2 day by my boyfriend and me. I just tried the dried fish, and I have to say it took some skill and research on how to eat it. My match told me to rip off a piece and add butter and then cook the skins with butter. I see what they mean, that skin is tough! The meat though, is so delicious. I love fish and dried meats so this was perfect for me, and with some grass fed butter slathered on top, just delicious. I told them I was on a Paleo diet, but still wanted some snacks, and they met that perfectly!
The full impact of an actual default is unclear, but Treasury, and independent experts have warned that it would among other consequences, cause an enormous loss of wealth among U.S. citizens. Under the circumstances, one would think that the government's top priority would be ensuring that citizens owed money by the Treasury would take precedence over, say, foreign governments. But that wouldn't be the case if Toomey and some House Republicans, including Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH), get their way.
The Administration thinks such a policy would be tone deaf. “Such a policy would also be unacceptable to American servicemen and women, retirees, and all other Americans, who would rightly reject the notion that their payment has been deemed a lower priority by their government,” Wolin added.

Let's go back about one year, to the origins of this charge of Russian interference. Now most Americans may not know this—or more likely, may no longer remember it, because they've been so thoroughly brainwashed—but at the bottom of the accusation of Russian interference, is the charge that the Russian government—using an on-line persona called "Guccifer 2.0"—hacked into Democratic National Committee e-mail files over the Internet, and gave them to Julian Assange's organization "Wikileaks." (Parenthetically: recall that Wikileaks began publishing DNC emails online on July 27, 2016. It's worth noting that the accuracy of these files has never been disputed, and that their proof of DNC intervention into the primary process on behalf of Hillary Clinton, and against Bernie Sanders, was so strong that DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign.)
The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 23, 1998. With eleven awards, Titanic tied with Ben-Hur for the most Academy Awards in Oscar history.[13] It also became the first film to win Best Picture without a screenwriting nomination since 1965's The Sound of Music.[14] Best Actress winner Helen Hunt became the first performer to win an Oscar while concurrently starring in a television series;[15] Jack Nicholson became the fourth performer to win at least three acting Oscars.[16] Both won for their roles in As Good as It Gets, making it the seventh film to win both lead acting awards.[17] Nominated for their performances as Rose DeWitt Bukater in Titanic, Best Actress nominee Kate Winslet and Best Supporting Actress nominee Gloria Stuart became the first pair of actresses nominated for portraying the same character in the same film.[18][19] At age 87, Stuart also became the oldest performer nominated for a competitive Oscar.[20]
Dashboard Confessional experienced a banner summer in 2015 when they co-headlined a tour with Third Eye Blind and frontman Chris Carrabba revealed that the band had plans for a new album. Now, as he readies to take the group back out on the road, headlining the Taste of Chaos tour with a lineup that includes Taking Back Sunday, Saves the Day, and Saosin, the 41-year-old music vet gives EW an update on what will be the group's seventh album: “I can say I am actively writing and recording new songs for Dashboard Confessional.”
And then there was the odious ban on questions at photo ops. Reporters were threatened with being banned from future events if they dared to shoot a question at the prime minister at activities designated as “photo opportunities.” At one point, Harper's office attempted to bar a TV cameraman from traveling with the prime minister overseas because he had dared ask a question at a previous event. They blinked when the TV network threatened not to go at all.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. US President Barack Obama has ordered a review of air security after a Nigerian man was charged with trying to blow up a transatlantic jet on Christmas Day. Spokesman Robert Gibbs said Mr Obama wanted to know how a man carrying explosives had managed to board a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. Airport security measures in the US and internationally have been tightened. On Sunday, a passenger on the same Northwest Airlines route triggered a brief security scare. The FBI later said the passenger had locked himself in a toilet, but the incident had not been serious. Mr Gibbs told ABC News the system of watch-lists used by US government agencies would be examined, after it emerged that the Christmas Day suspect was listed and known to officials. A US record for 23-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was created last month. 'Dangerous substance' The US government uses three watch-lists, which become shorter as risk increases. They include one with some 550,000 names on it, a "selectee" list with 18,000 people within the higher-risk category, and a "no-fly" list with 4,000 names of people who are not allowed to board planes.

UPDATE: Comcast executive vice president David Cohen has issued the following statement in response to the FCC's decision to rework net neutrality regulations: “Comcast supported the Commission's Open Internet Order as an appropriate balance of protection of consumer and business interests and we agreed in the NBCUniversal Transaction Order to abide by the Open Internet rules for seven years even if the rules were modified by the courts. With the direction announced today, FCC Chairman Wheeler has taken a thoughtful approach which creates a path for enforceable rules based on the appropriate authority outlined by the Court's findings. We continue to be committed to work with Chairman Wheeler and the Commission to play a constructive role going forward that will continue to allow the Internet to flourish.”

The Fed went from providing liquidity to providing lender of last resort assistance (via the Term Auction Facility, TAF, essentially the anonymous discount window), to becoming intermediary of first resort (commercial paper financing facility, e.g.) to ending up creating the mother of all maturity mismatches through the mortgage-backed securities buying binge– which the Fed Chairman admits won't be unwound (actually it can be, but the losses that would probably be involved would shock even the Fed's most dependable apologists).
The evolution of Isaac Heeney began late in 2016, and his permanent move to the midfield will help cover the loss of Tom Mitchell to Hawthorn. Three-time All Australian wingman Dan Hannebery and the unheralded Jake Lloyd could spend more time in the centre square in 2017, leaving Heeney room to move on the wing, where he starred during last season's finals series. The 20-year-old has brilliant hands, a fantastic mark for his size, and magnificent recovery when the ball hits the deck, making him an extremely tough match-up. - Adam Curley

Rep. Mike Rogers told ABC's This Week that Edward Snowden committed treason by asking for asylum in Brazil while defending the NSA surveillance program. Rogers, who is also the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the White House report urging surveillance reform at least made the case that the agency's tactics tactics are legal. But the recommendations had one major flaw, he said: private companies should not hold user data. "I think it opens it up to more privacy violations when the company holds it," Rogers said. "These are business records, not private records of content, so they're not listening to phone calls." On Snowden, he accused the former contractor of treason for seeking asylum in Brazil. "I do think he should come home — I would personally pay for his plane ticket — and be held accountable for his actions," Rogers said. "He has contacted a foreign country and said I would sell you classified information for something of value... We call that treason, and I think that letter very clearly lays out who this gentleman is and what his intentions are clearly." Snowden offered to protect Brazil from NSA spying. He did not, in fact, offer to sell them state secrets.

In 2009, 17-year-old Brittanee Drexel told her mother she was spending spring break no more than 32 kilometers (20 mi) from their home in Rochester, New York. Instead, she headed to the party town of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina with her boyfriend and friends. While there, she went to the Blue Water Hotel to visit a friend who was staying there. She stayed about 10 minutes, then walked out of the hotel lobby at 9:00 PM, never to be seen again. Surveillance cameras caught her entering and leaving the Blue Water, but offered no other clues.
Far from being contained to a specific area, the rejection of foreigners and international troops is pervasive across Afghanistan. This is a major problem for the coalition. A few outrageously manipulated polls notwithstanding, Afghans obviously see the coalition as an occupying force. With war crimes committed by some rogue U.S. troops and vile pictures of American servicemen smiling near the bodies of dead civilians still circulating widely via mobile phone—even to the most remote Afghan villages—the credibility of the coalition is destroyed.
Some analysts, ranging from scientists David Pimentel of Cornell University to financial advisor and philanthropist Jeremy Grantham, dare to underline the possibility of a darker alternative future. Defying the optimistic majority, they suggest that humanity long ago overshot a truly sustainable world population, implying that apocalyptic horsemen old and new could cause widespread death as the environment unravels. Most writers on environment and population are loathe to touch such predictions. But we should be asking, at least, whether such possibilities are real enough to temper the usual demographic confidence about future population projections.
She said that one young woman she was working with had significant graft-versus-host disease, a potential side effect of stem cell transplantation that made her skin painfully sensitive to touch. Her partner would try to hold her hand or touch her stomach, and she would push him away or jump at his touch. It only took two times for him to get the message that “she didn't want to be touched,” Dr. Bolte said. Unfortunately, by the time they showed up at Dr. Bolte's office and the young woman's condition had improved, she thought her boyfriend was no longer attracted to her. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, was afraid to touch her out of fear of causing pain or making an unwanted pass. All that was needed to help them reconnect was a little communication.
I know that my girlfriends and I are not the only women out there who are wondering how to help themselves and their friends answer difficult questions about sex and cancer. Sex can be a squeamish subject even when cancer isn't part of the picture, so the combination of sex and cancer together can feel impossible to talk about. But women like me and my friends shouldn't have to suffer in silence.

Shu recalls thinking that she wouldn't make it. “My girlfriends and I would say things like, ‘I'd die if something happened to one of my children.'” But when she woke up the next day, after her son had passed, she said, “Damn, I didn't die.” And today, she says, Jakobi is still with her. The Jakobi Ra Park, named in 2011 after Shu's son, was the first venue of what eventually would become Avalon Village. And at the September ribbon-cutting ceremony for the project — held on the same day her son was killed nine years ago — a headstone was unveiled in his memory.

As researcher Peter Dale Scott revealed [11] in 2008, when Congressman Peter DeFazio, Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson and Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Christopher Carney sought access to classified COG annexes, their request was denied by the White House. Scott wrote: "DeFazio's inability to get access to the NSPD Annexes is less than reassuring. If members of the Homeland Security Committee cannot enforce their right to read secret plans of the Executive Branch, then the systems of checks and balances established by the U.S. Constitution would seem to be failing."

While the world rejoices in the aftermath of the enjoyable diversion in which a fake market surges on fake, politically-motivated data, which incidentally refutes the warning voiced last week by the Fed Chairman who has a far better grasp of the economy than the BLS, warned last week, the confluence of real events continues to indicate that something is brewing in the middle east. Only this time it is not the US adding another aircraft carrier to the three already situated by the Straits of Hormuz. This time the smoke and fire come from Israel. ABC reports that "Israeli facilities in North America -- and around the world -- are on high alert, according to an internal security document obtained by ABC News that predicted the threat from Iran against Jewish targets will increase. "We predict that the threat on our sites around the world will increase … on both our guarded sites and 'soft' sites," stated a letter circulated by the head of security for the Consul General for the Mid-Atlantic States. Guarded sites refer to government facilities like embassies and consulates, while 'soft sites' means Jewish synagogues, and schools, as well as community centers like the one hit by a terrorist bombing in Buenos Aires in 1994 that killed 85 people." Hopefully the head of security's prediction track record is better than that of the CBO, and that the very act of prediction does not in effect "make it so." At least courtesy of this latest escalation by Israel we get a clue of what to focus on, if not so much who the actual aggressors will be. In the meantime, Iran, which has been dealing with hyperinflation for weeks now, and likely has bigger problems to worry about than focusing on "soft sites" will naturally sense this escalation as the provocation it may well be meant to be, respond in kind, which will lead to further responses of definite attacks imminent by Iran's adversaries, and so on, and so forth, until finally the dam wall finally cracks.
In the late 15th century, the Zytglogge and the other Bernese gate towers were extended and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal bellman visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower.[7] The astronomical clock was extended to its current state. In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.[8]
When the great bell rings out every full hour, struck by a large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek personification of time, is traditionally nicknamed Hans von Thann by the Bernese.[19] The wooden bell-striker, which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nürnberg,[20] while the current and most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770.[17]
A clock is documented in this tower since 1405,[27] when a new bell was installed. The city accounts of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks. The first mention of a dial is in 1443, and the first known image of the, much smaller first astrolabium dial (in the diary a cobbler journeyman from Ulm) is dated 1534. The jacquemart (bellstriker) is also documented in the same 1534 source.[citation needed]
In the first two decades of the sixteenth century many craftsmen unsuccessfully tried to improve the clockworks. The current movement was made in 1530 by clockmaker Kaspar Brunner and is dated and signed by a forged nameplate. No other clockworks by this master are known. The core of the movement was forged in situ, in the very room it is still located, and the fire pit of the forge remains in the room. One of the more unusual features of the movement is that each individual tooth of the major gears is removable (i.e., replaceable as it wears).[citation needed]

On any given weekend, in any part of the state where I live, you can find yourself standing in a hall full of knives, if that's the kind of thing you like to do. It is a very niche kind of experience. Not so in some other weapons expos—like the Arms and Armor galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where everyone, from the most warlike to the staunchest of pacifists, stands in awe at the intricate ornamentation and incredibly deft craftsmanship on display in the suits of armor, lances, shields, and lots and lots of knives.

Mumbai: Bangladesh bowler Rubel Hossain came and spoke to India batsman Virat Kohli when he walked out in the middle at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday. No, it wasn't a meeting of long lost companions. The story is far more intense. It could be sensed when Hossain – after dismissing the 26-year-old – jumped in celebrations and kept looking at the batsman after muttering few words.
Consider: Like Gump, Scully has not only made it big in the sports world but also has hobnobbed with presidents (including the time he played ball against a future president), chatted with rock stars, acted as brand pitchman and done other outlandish things, such as race Jackie Robinson on ice skates. He also narrated a sitcom and had his own talk show.
“Can you believe this ballgame at Shea?” Scully asked, just seconds before Mookie Wilson hits the infamous grounder up the first baseline and through the legs of Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner, scoring Ray Knight from second base. After proclaiming “The Mets win it!”, Scully remained silent for nearly 3 ½ minutes as the crowd roared.

For those who weren't around or don't remember, Bone is the tale of three cousins, Fone Bone, Phoney Bone, and Smiley Bone. Fone is the everyman hero, Phoney is a cynical con artist, and Smiley is a goofball who goes along with things. Having been exiled from their Boneville home, they make their way through a kingdom full of magic and danger. Part of the fun of Bone is in the mix of styles: the Bone cousins are Walt Kelly-esque cartoon characters, while the world they've entered is a high-fantasy setting full of realistic humans and creepy monsters.
On paper, the 2017 Cubs should be even better than the curse-busting crew of a year ago. The heart and soul of the team are young stars who have not yet reached their prime on baseball's actuarial tables. The third baseman Kris Bryant, who won the Rookie of the Year award in 2015, and is the reigning league M.V.P., turned twenty-five in January. Addison Russell, the elegant All-Star shortstop, is just twenty-three. Javier Báez, an ebullient infielder whose prestidigitation in the field and thunderous bat helped ignite the Cubs during last year's playoff, is twenty-four. The first baseman Anthony Rizzo, the team's emotional leader and longest-tenured Cub, is all of twenty-seven.
The only discernible chink in the Cubs' armor is an aging corps of starting pitchers. Lester is thirty-three. John Lackey is thirty-eight. And Jake Arrieta is thirty-one. Of the top four starters, only Kyle Hendricks, at twenty-seven, would be considered young by baseball standards. Behind them are several journeymen who have been auditioning for the fifth starting spot. The Cubs' league-best pitching staff was remarkably healthy and consistent last year. Epstein acknowledges that this run of luck cannot be counted on again. “If one of our pitchers goes down, we just don't have the same depth we do with position players,” he told me, suggesting that he might be forced to barter some of his prized minor-league prospects for more pitching later this year.

When I was in law school, one of my classmates criticized women who changed their last names after marriage. In her view, every woman who took her husband's last name was letting the rest of womankind down. I disagreed and believe that women should stop judging other women for their personal choices. Feminism is not about telling anyone what they “should” do – it's about empowering women with the freedom to forge their own path. Whether a woman wants to run a household or a corporation, she shouldn't be held back by the negativity and judgment of others.
What corporates are also worried about is whether the anti-profiteering clause will result in witch-hunting by tax authorities. “The fear among corporates with respect to anti-profiteering is that it gives lot of power to the taxmen who may misuse it and harass taxpayers since a slew of indirect taxes will now be out of window and with that, their access to taxpayers would lessen," said Sachin Menon, partner and national head (indirect tax) at KPMG India.
Denmark is the highest-ranked nation that has never hosted the IIHF's flagship event but has organized other IIHF events like Division I tournaments in the U20 and U18 categories and the Final Olympic Qualification. It would be the biggest single sporting event ever held in Denmark, which presented its bid under the slogan “We are ready”. “We have a plan to move our great sport forward and today we can say we are ready. Let's create a new home for hockey,” said the Danish Ice Hockey Union's President and IIHF Council member, Henrik Bach Nielsen. Denmark has played in lower divisions for decades before earning promotion in 2002. Since 2003 the Danes have been playing in the top division and have begun producing NHL-calibre talent. “Until some years ago hockey had little coverage in Denmark. We kept believing in ourselves and were willing to become better. We want to be a top hockey nation,” Edmonton Oilers' defenseman Philip Larsen said in his speech. “We are still one final step missing: the chance to show our fans what we can do on home ice. By that we can show all the other small nations what they can accomplish with hard work and team spirit.” Latvia The Danish bid competes against another bid from one of the smaller nations. But Latvia with its fans joining their national team all over the world brings huge passion to the international stage. The Baltic nation of roughly two million people had the chance to host the World Championship once, in 2006, with two venues in its capital of Riga. That's where the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation would like to stage the event again in 2018: in the city of 643,600, currently the European Capital of Culture, with over a million people living in the region. Arena Riga, the main venue of the 2006 IIHF World Championship, will offer a capacity of 10,300 seats. Since being constructed for the Worlds, the venue not far from the city centre in the west also hosted smaller IIHF events, two Final Olympic Qualification tournaments and it became home to Dinamo Riga, Latvia's entry in the Russian-based Kontinental Hockey League. Latvia also hopes for more prominent hockey legacy. A new 8,000-seat arena not far from the city centre and the airport will be financed by the Latvian state and the Riga municipality and be built by December 2016. A feasibility study is under development. It will be located on the other side of River Daugava in the University Campus and shall be part of a new sporting area. Additionally, new practice facilities will be built near each of the venues and three other small ice rinks already exist. Like in 2006 Latvia promises a fan-friendly event with ticket prices starting at five euros and fan zones at the arenas, downtown at the Congress Hall and in the picturesque old-town district. “We proved in 2006 that we can host the World Championship. The organization was great then and we gained great experience. With the experience we have, it will be even much better organized in 2018,” said Kirovs Lipmans, the President of the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation. “Latvia is a small country with about two million people and almost two million people are ice hockey fans because it's our national sport. We had about 11,000 fans from Latvia coming here to Belarus. People are so excited about our game here. It is very important for us to host. Latvia has never disappointed the hockey family.” Latvia played in four top-level World Championships in the ‘30s before being cut off during the Soviet era. After restoring independence, the Latvian national team earned its way up to the top division where it has played since 1997 in addition to four straight Olympic participations. The World Championship would also be part of the 100-year anniversary of Latvia's foundation as an independent country.

All three actors make this thing sing, projecting a lived-in authenticity that's matched by Mackeznie's (mostly) relaxed style – this is a movie that knows these coffee shops, motels, and Indian casinos, and luxuriates in them. (There's a great little scene in a diner, with a nasty spark plug of a waitress who orders for you, that's so authentic it feels like a documentary.) Yet there's an overriding sense that this durable way of life isn't long for this world; a cowboy rustling his herd away from a wildfire muses, “And I wonder why my kids won't do this shit for a livin',” which, in retrospect, might be the theme of the entire movie.
Meanwhile, Mackenzie's camera lingers on the edges of the frame. In the first scene, he stays on a bank's exterior wall long enough to read the graffiti: “3 tours in Iraq and no bailout for us.” When Marcus and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) post up in a motel for the night, prosperity gospel blasts from the television (“He wouldn't know God if he crawled up his pantleg and bit him on the pecker,” Marcus grouses). As the bank-robbing brothers, and the lawmen pursuing them, shuttle from town to town, we keep catching sight of the highway signs, for debt relief and payday loans. And when one of them knocks over the bank across from a diner, one of the old-timers who spend his day there doesn't seem much bothered by it: “It's been robbin' me thirty years.”

I was working in an FM radio, as an anchorman and I was doing extremely well. I was 22 and already a little star on my field (and even now, 15 years later, I can meet persons who are remembering my voice). Things were evolving really fast and soon I had on my plate much more than I could handle. In about a year I was overwhelmed and I simply cracked. Overheated by work and unguided by some personal goals, I just quit. I had excuses, of course, I was only 23 year oldÂ it was too much for me.

It's a very good thing that Vince McMahon is a really, really good on-air personality. Whether it's natural-born talent, just being around the business for his entire life, or a combination of both, the owner of WWE is also one of its most compelling characters. Without the juxtaposition of his evil, corporate, conniving Mr. McMahon character to the politically incorrect, beer-swilling everyman in Stone Cold Steve Austin, pro wrestling as we know it today may not even exist. He's been involved in some of the most important, intelligent, and celebrated storylines in the history of professional wrestling.
The Mr. McMahon character is portrayed as crass, money-grubbing, and the type of person who will sacrifice family and reputation for unyielding amounts money and power. The real Vince McMahon, however, is…well, crass, money-grubbing, and the type of person who will sacrifice family and reputation for unyielding amounts of money and power. He provides the perfect ying to Donald Trump's yang, who by contrast is crass, money-grubbing…y'know what, you get it. They're both greedy heirs to multi-million dollar fortunes, so what made McMahon think that the blue-collar everyman he had spent a lifetime creating stories for would be the least bit entertained by two members of the now-coined One Percent must have been some pretty good s--t. Trump and Vince got into a heated feud for some contrived, unimportant reason. All I know is we got notoriously strange as hell looking Bobby Lashley barbarically shaving Vince McMahon's head in front of tens of thousands of people, so the angle wasn't a total bust.
You won't get Hoyer to play along with the storyline that goes like this: Poor, Brian Hoyer. Spent all those years backing up Tom Brady in New England, finally got his dream-come-true shot in his hometown of Cleveland and blew out his knee after going 3-0 as the Browns' starter in 2013. Came back strong, only to see the Browns change coaches and front office personnel and wind up spending a first-round pick on Manziel, the former Texas A&M Heisman winner and presumed franchise savior. What lousy timing yet again for the underdog. All that's left is for the rookie to beat out the sixth-year journeyman and get on with the fascinating saga that everyone is tuning in to see.

I walked back into my office and had a text from my mom “Check ur email. Read about Padres prospects 2b…then catchers.” Apparently she had found an article writing up all the guys in our organization and we were going to have a laugh over the fact that I was still listed as a second baseman in spite of the fact that I'd been working out at Instructs as a catcher. When I opened my hotmail inbox I found not only her email address, but one from AJ Hinch, the assistant general manager of the Padres. I opened his first figuring it was something important, it was the first time I'd ever gotten an email from that high in the front office. His email asked me to call the GM Josh Byrnes, which I did immediately. Apparently the club had tried to call my American phone number but being home in Toronto that phone was off, so email was the only way to get in touch with me. Mr. Byrnes told me that I'd been traded to the Tampa Bay Rays in a seven player deal. He thanked me for working hard while with the Padres and wished me luck in my new organization. He had nothing but positive things to say, and I was thankful that was the case. He agreed to pass my Canadian phone number to the Rays front office so they could contact me later.

There probably are only two spots along the line at which the 49ers feel comfortable writing a starter's name in ink: left tackle and center. In Staley and Kilgore, the team not only has two dependable players but linemen who have the athleticism to fit into the zone-blocking schemes Chip Kelly likes to use (and which the 49ers, who had been a traditional power-blocking team, mixed in last year).
Staley made the Pro Bowl in 2015 and hasn't missed a start since 2010. He's signed through the 2019 season at a very reasonable rate. Still, the No. 7 pick is where a team can grab a big-ticket item such as a future left tackle and Notre Dame's Ronnie Stanley could be available. The Eagles' first draft pick under Kelly was tackle Lane Johnson, who was described as the ideal lineman for Kelly because of his length and quickness. He ran his 40-yard dash in 4.72 seconds that year, second best for an offensive lineman.
G Joshua Garnett, Stanford: He's a wide-bodied interior lineman who is well-versed in power blocking and who was very good at getting downfield to deliver blocks with the Cardinal.
G/C Nick Martin: He's the younger brother of Cowboys lineman Zack Martin. While Kilgore has played well at center, the 49ers have struggled when he has been injured. Martin, a mid-round pick, would provide stability at two spots.

Redistricting has forced two freshmen House Republicans from Arizona to run for the same northwestern Phoenix seat. John McCain, the state's senior senator, has a favorite. McCain endorsed Ben Quayle, son of the former vice president, for a very McCain-like reason.
Neither contest was as high on the neoconservatives' radar screen as Paul versus Grayson. House members are generally less influential than senators, after all. But suffice it to say that Amash and Massie are not exactly Cheney-Giuliani-McCain Republicans on foreign policy. This is a departure from the not-too-distant past, such as when Iraq war hawks hoped taxpayer groups and anti-earmarks crusaders would help them oust antiwar Congressman Walter Jones in a 2008 GOP primary.

Battle Creek police are seeking charges for a 19-year-old Battle Creek man after his girlfriend was injured in an accidental shooting. (Photo: File)
ACCIDENTAL SHOOTING: Battle Creek police are seeking charges for a 19-year-old Battle Creek man after his girlfriend was injured in an accidental shooting. Officers were called at 2:27 a.m. Sunday after the woman, 19, arrived at Bronson Battle Creek for treatment of a gunshot wound to the leg. She told police she and her boyfriend were walking on North Avenue when someone fired a shot from a car hitting her in the lower leg. When police questioned her about details she eventually confessed she was accidentally shot by her boyfriend at a home on Boyd Drive. The boyfriend first told officers the woman was shot by one of two men in a car which stopped while they were walking to a store for cigarettes. He said someone from a car stopped and one of two men inside said "Is that you?" and fired a single shot. He later confessed to the accidental shooting after officers also confronted him about the physical evidence. He then told police he bought the gun for $200 from a man in a car two weeks earlier and was looking at it when it fired, hitting the woman. Police said the gun was reported stolen in Marshall in 2016. Police recovered the weapon and some illegal drugs from a lock box hidden by a friend of the man. The case was sent to the Calhoun County prosecutor for review.
Not that she's resting on her laurels. James Brett's Museum of Everything, which opens this month, will take over the Ultralounge exhibition hall and many of the store's windows, and will feature the work of artists who are “outside the formal art world, who didn't go to the Slade”. Then she wants to have a proper tailor in womenswear so women can have handmade shirts, she wants to reinvent the fitting room, make them a lovely place to sit, places where girlfriends can try on things together. “I want to bring in designers who are below the radar; have a room full of sewing machines, like the Sweat Shop in Paris, so that people can personalise their jeans; up on the roof there's a whole space to be reinvented, there's a hotel that needs to be burnished up and remade in the Selfridges enterprising image.

All exhibitions of Tom's work are sanctioned and assisted by the Tom of Finland Foundation, which serves as the worldwide guardian of his legacy, and also runs the incredible Tom House in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles — which is itself the star of a beautiful 2016 coffee table book. This craftsman home where Tom himself once lived and worked — and where Dehner and Foundation vice president S. R. Sharp still do — is now a living museum of Tom-ness, where scores of pieces of his original artwork are displayed, and thousands more are carefully archived. Of course a strong sexual charge infuses the Tom House air, but it's also an incredibly relaxed and welcoming place, and a fascinating center of very alive gay history that's always open to all.
If you're confused, don't worry—most people are. It started as a small, funny annoyance: Will Butler of Arcade Fire, and I, happen to share the same name. To confuse the matter further, there's Win Butler, the frontman of Arcade Fire. The brothers, with nearly identical names, are confusing enough; throw me in there and it's an SEO nightmare. But haha, no big deal, right?
I crept in late with my good friend Chris Catalena, a musician from Bryan, Texas and heir to the Catalena Hatters, meaning, he always wears a cowboy hat, even indoors. That's how Texas he is. Towards the end of the panel, he leaned over to me and suggested, in his sweet Southern drawl, “you wanna ask ‘em a question?” He read my mind. As a line started to form behind the microphone for Q&A, I knew the time was right. I was going to call out the Butlers, Krugman, and anyone else who might challenge my namesake, before an audience of hundreds, in a room full of journalists and media moguls alike. I was going to get involved.
Angry witches are using cat excrement and dead dogs to cast spells on the president and government who are forcing them to pay taxes. Also in the eye of the taxman are fortune tellers, who should have seen it coming. And President Traian Basescu isn't laughing it off. In a country where superstition is mainstream, the president and his aides wear purple on Thursdays, allegedly to ward off evil spirits. Witches from Romania's eastern and western regions will descend to the southern plains and the Danube River Thursday to threaten the government with spells and spirits. Mauve has a high vibration, it makes the wearer superior and wards off evil attacks, according to the esoteric group Violet Flame - which practices on Thursdays.
Also, I can't remember the last time my Congressman was threatened with a potion made of cat poop and dead dog parts. Said queen witch (and horror stew brewer) Bratara Buzea of Romania's tax evasion troubles, "They want to take the country out of this crisis using us? They should get us out of the crisis because they brought us into it."
After shooting each girl multiple times, Battaglia went to a bar with his girlfriend and then a tattoo parlor for tattoos related to each girl, Paxton's office said. Battaglia was arrested outside the tattoo parlor.
Managing to get to university was relatively uncomplicated as well as the educational function straightforward. much far more testing was interacting with other students and trying to develop the interpersonal life which i knew my contemporaries were experiencing. university is in which a amount of youthful people make their first serious forays in to the world of relationships and sex. for that most part my attempts to form friendships as well as to strike up discussion were rebuffed. I felt like a foreigner inside a new country, speaking a language no a single understood. The notion of getting together with girlfriends as well as forming friendships with them, which I had hoped would be feasible in this new environment, began to seem unachievable. physical intimacy or, dare I say it, sex seemed entirely out of the question. Was there something wrong with me, apart from your obvious? I began to think which i have required to explore these challenges in depth with somebody else, but it was hard to think of the right person.
But Scalise's opponent, House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.), voted no. So did Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), McCarthy's only opponent so far in the Speaker race.
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) lamented having to turn to another stopgap bill after his panel spent months working on individual spending measures. House members toiled late into the night debating six of the 12 annual spending bills over the summer, only to see the process derailed after Democrats offered amendments regarding the display of the Confederate flag.
At some point Orwell tries to trick his girlfriend Sonia Brownell into leaving the relative safety of London and joining him in The Shadow Lands That Lie to the North. The directions are suitably foreboding, comprised as they are of a Byzantine jumble of post-war train schedules that are clearly more theoretical than otherwise, and then a couple of ferry rides that no doubt expose the traveler to a charming array of whirlpools and sea monsters. Alternatively, he writes, she can take a plane; I do not care to even guess at what such an undertaking would entail. What's really striking about all of this is that Scotland can apparently be reached by conventional means, whereas I would have more readily believed such a journey to involve passing through a swirling, blood-red portal, or perhaps stepping into the gaping jaws of an immense and lascivious cacodemon. And so you, too, can venture into this black magical world of violent gales, milkless mammals, bird attacks, rotting dear, and poisoned, lice-ridden hens, where the great secular saint of the 20th century stalks the landscape in search of bunnies to execute and where the very seas conspire to drown those who manage to survive the boggings — this bone-sceptered isle, this eggless land of unsatisfactory lobster boxes and very tiny strawberries, this Scotland.
The actor, who faced a lot of online criticism from 'Bigg Boss 7' winner Gauhar Khan and boyfriend Kushal Tandon, said he will continue to take stand as that is the only way to save the contestants from embarrassing themselves on TV.
The Taliban then kidnapped 30 members of the Bhittani tribe. Twenty-two were executed in a brutal fashion. “Some of the dead were shot and some had their throats slit,” a district official told AFP. “The men's hands were tied behind their backs and the corpses left in a drain by a roadside,” AFP reported. The tribesmen have also been described as “pro-Karzai,” referring to Afghanistan's president.
If it's possible for you to act on your unnamed-but-easily-identified desires in an ethical manner—if you desire to do whatever it is you desire to do with consenting adults who desire to take their turn doing it to you—this so-called expert on sexuality thinks you should crawl down off that cross and find yourself a boyfriend already. (“Pray away” the gay? I'm guessing you're Christian, probably Catholic.) And if you experience a moment's anxiety the first time you stick your ass in the air—pull the Jesus stick out first!—just remind yourself that things have been crawling on top of each other and madly humping away for 850 million years. Sex came first, then humanity (200,000ish years ago), then religion came along tens of thousands of years after that. Which may explain why religion, when pitted against sex (really old) and human nature (pretty old), always loses. Always.
Look, kiddo, you get one life, one chance at happiness. If it gives you a spiritual semi to fantasize about a God who created you gay but forbids you to act on your emotional and sexual attraction to men, knock your damn self out. But you can have a boyfriend and Jesus, too—look at the pope—you just have to do what people have been doing since the first terrified idiot invented the first bullshit religion: improvise. Find yourself a brand-new religion or sect, or jettison the bits of your current faith that don't work for you. If you know anything about the history of Christianity—and it sounds like you don't—then you know that the revisions began before the body was cold. No reason to stop now.
Finally, when I came out to my mother, the first thing out of her mouth was, “I don't ever want to meet any boyfriends.” She said the word “boyfriend” like it had been dipped in shit. On her deathbed, my mother told me to tell my boyfriend that she loved him (“like a daughter”). My mom came around, HOMO, and so can yours.
And before I go about demonstrating how, sadly, easy it is to prove the dumbness dragging down our country, let me just say that ignorance has life and death consequences. On the eve of the Iraq War, 69% of Americans thought Saddam Hussein was personally involved in 9/11. Four years later, 34% still did. Or take the health care debate we're presently having: members of Congress have recessed now so they can go home and "listen to their constituents." An urge they should resist because their constituents don't know anything. At a recent town-hall meeting in South Carolina, a man stood up and told his Congressman to "keep your government hands off my Medicare," which is kind of like driving cross-country to protest highways.
Under the terms of the deal, GFH Capital will retain a minority stake. Chairman Salah Nooruddin, who along with GFHC and Bahrain's International Investment Bank is United's current other major shareholder, will remain involved.
Hi! I am Pierre, a frenchman living in London, and I came to Aragon to help build the user interfaces. Before this I was working at Canonical, spending my time building a few different things. I was in the design team as a prototype developer, working on the Ubuntu Phone, Unity 8, Ubuntu UI toolkit and some related Design tools for those.
“Many of the great alchemists – a subject I'm fascinated by – were seeking to find angels that they could command. Magic is seen as an unapproved ritual when it's to bring profit to oneself, but they were seeking to command these entities to bring them forth the secret to turn base-metals into precious metals. I have found a number of instances where alchemists were visited by a gentleman in black, a prosperous burgher in black, who appeared in the laboratory and demonstrated certain things to them. Some are benevolent and some are more sinister.”
Frenchy's craftsmanship has made him a celebrity in the cannabis world, a position of prominence he's achieved thanks to how-to videos on YouTube, endless Q&As he answers on message boards, and a steady stream of the result — large, dark hunks of hash rolled into loaves or flattened and fashioned into his signature “cannolis” — posted on Instagram, where he's amassed almost 10,000 followers in less than seven months. He's a draw at cannabis cups, and he has begun hosting hash-making seminars in Los Angeles and the Bay Area that cost hundreds of dollars to attend, and promptly sell out.
The Lightning will officially call up defenseman Slater Koekkoek from Syracuse of the AHL on Friday evening, Erlendsson added.
In addition to McCain, other NDAA negotiators include House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas, and the ranking Democrats, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington and Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island.
“Sen. Reed supports protecting religious liberty and opposes provisions that would discriminate against American servicemen and women based on their gender or sexual orientation,” Reed spokesman Chip Unruh said in a statement to Roll Call. “This particular provision has nothing to do with national defense and it could undermine existing federal nondiscrimination rules.”
4. Most will blame Kellen Clemens for the loss on Sunday. However, most also forget that he was playing behind an offensive line that was missing their three highest paid linemen (Scott Wells, Jake Long, and Harvey Dahl). The St. Louis Rams might have more money on the bench/IR then any other team in the NFL this season…
8. While the contact negotiations of Rodger Saffold will likely be the talking point of the St. Louis Rams offseason, the most “difficult” decision may revolve around the contract of Kendall Langford. Aside from being thrown out of the game yesterday for “contact with an official[‘s hat],” Langford has put together some brilliant performances in the second half of the season. In fact, dating back to Week 9 against the Tennessee Titans, Langford registered three Top 5 grades among interior defensive linemen against the run. Moreover, the converted 3-4 defensive end finished the season with 49 tackles (2nd among linemen), with five sacks, six tackles for a loss, and four pass deflections. While it certainly does not hurt to be lined up next to the best pass rusher in the NFL, Langford has shown that he has the ability to be a top tier interior 4-3 defensive tackle. However, he is currently sporting the eighth-highest average salary on the entire team, fourth-largest among defensive players. We'll see if that stands this offseason…
The only known case of a botched execution by firing squad, in 1951 in Utah, appears to have been an act of vengeance on the part of five trained marksmen pulling the trigger. They targeted the wrong side of the prisoner's chest, apparently intentionally, and he bled to death.
This play was from McAdoo's very first game as the Giants' offensive coordinator. On the surface it's a pretty routine spread formation, a shotgun with "10" personnel. But take a closer look at the numbers on the back of the jerseys. At "Wide Receiver" are tight ends Larry Donnell and Daniel Fells. At "Slot Receiver" are running back Rashad Jennings and offensive lineman Dallas Reynolds. Next to Manning at halfback is fullback Henry Hynoski. The play was ultimately a fade to Donnell in the corner of the end zone, which would have been successful if he had gotten his second foot down in-bounds. The formation, personnel, and play call are all at odds with each other. It's undoubtedly a heavy personnel, which should signal run, but it is also a spread formation. What's more, it's a back-shoulder fade to the corner of the end zone, which is generally not a play that goes to a tight end, but tight ends generally don't get lined up at wide receiver.
Maybe Argentina? It has a woman president and—get this—her husband was president before her. Right before her. Cristina Kirchner was married to Néstor Kirchner before his death in 2010. Néstor served as president from 2003 to 2007, and before that, he was a governor. Sounds familiar. Then he became Argentina's first gentleman when Cristina was elected in 2007. She was re-elected in 2011. High notes of former President Néstor Kirchner's time as first gentlemen include being elected national deputy for Buenos Aires Province, negotiating to release hostages, participating in a government conflict with the agricultural sector, and serving as secretary general of the Union of South American Nations representing the entire continent. Now that's more like it. Of course, he was a Peronist (dictatorial, polarizing, unpopular) who became friends with Hugo Chavez. OK, maybe not so much a model.
With Bill back in the White House, if not the Oval Office, the country may see a first gentleman at the direction of Madame President advising on domestic and foreign policy, barnstorming key districts after the State of the Union, quelling Middle East diplomatic tensions and mediating on behalf of various party agendas. He could do this while stopping by his alma mater, Georgetown, to give a lecture or two while continuing to work on his family's foundation.
In addition to proposing a bill to abolish the EPA, Freshman Congressman Matt Gaetz is making headlines this week for his refusal to condemn supporters who have threatened to perform violence in his name.
“I need all patriots in attendance to protect Congressman Gaetz from any potential disruption of his speech. Concealed carry permit holders most welcome – don't forget your ammo.”
I've toyed with Linux since 2002, when I first installed Mandrake. With the latest release of Ubuntu, I was interested to see how far Linux had come since then in terms of being used easily by the mainstream. So, I tricked my grudging girlfriend Erin into sitting down at a brand new Ubuntu 8.04 installation and performing some basic tasks. It's surprising how many seemingly simple things become complicated and even out of reach for someone without a knowledge of Linux. There are a lot of little things that could be done to make the experience a lot more friendly for non-computer-literate people – some of them easy to implement, others not at all.
from China is the world's hairiest man with hair covering 96 percent of his body. Yu was diagnosed with a rare condition that causes hair to grow in places it normally shouldn't. He was born in a farmer family and when he was only 2 years old his parents noticed he had hair coming out of his auditory canals. His situation worsened as he grew up and now almost his entire body is covered with long thick hair.But Yu might have the chance of living a normal life, he is now undertaking a laser treatment to have his hair removed. Basically, every hair on his body will have to be zapped with laser. That can't be pleasant, but for Yu Zenhuan it's nowhere as painful as looking in the mirror.Couple of days ago his girlfriend posted some new photos on a Chinese forum.Here they are.
The decision was supported by the 2011 report from the Pentagon's test office that the drone system was “not operationally effective.” Among its numerous drawbacks was its inability to carry out assigned missions 75% of the time. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Congress that in addition to the system's unacceptable failure rate, the drone system “has fundamentally priced itself out of our ability to afford it.”
As Cockburn reports: “It made no difference. Congress, led by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon and Democratic Congressman Jim Moran (whose northern Virginia district hosts the headquarters of both Northrop and Raytheon) effortless brushed aside these pleas, forcing the Air Force to keep buying the unwanted drone.”
In February, Spearman awarded Ha and his attorneys the full amount requested of $45,103.98. The prosecutor had opposed the request seeking a reduction of the amount requested but was denied by Judge Spearman.
“I've talked to a lot of individuals throughout our state — scientists, environmental advocates, fishermen and boaters — and all of them are telling me of their concerns about how the environment is changing in our state,” she says. “And the changes we are already seeing in Casco Bay and the Gulf of Maine, for example, are cause for alarm.”
DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the lawsuit is “absolutely necessary” because what the state did is “absolutely wrong” but will continue unless action is taken.
Bowing: “A gentleman should not bow from a window to a lady on the street, though he may bow slightly from the street upon being recognized by a lady in a window. Such recognition should, however, generally be avoided, as gossip is likely to attach undue importance to it when seen by others.”
Conduct to avoid at the ball: “No gentleman should enter the ladies' dressing room at a ball.”
Might be the greatest draft pick in NFL history. Taken in the 27th round, Brown made nine Pro Bowls and all-NFL eight times. Best lineman in Giants history, enshrined in Hall of Fame in 1975.
From Seven24Films and IDW Entertainment, Wynonna Earp is described as “Justified meets Buffy The Vampire Slayer” if Buffy could hold her whiskey and only wore cowboy boots.” A modern supernatural Western, it follows Wyatt Earp's great granddaughter as she battles demons and other supernatural beings and uses her unique abilities and a dysfunctional posse of allies to bring the paranormal to justice. The series, set to start production in September in Calgary, is scheduled to premiere in April 2016.

How much did it hurt?: This one's a tough call, since the 2013 draft was a strange one. At the time the lottery was held, the consensus top pick was defenseman Seth Jones. In fact, some of the more conspiracy-minded fans found it odd that Jones' hometown Avalanche just happened to be the ones to win the right to take him.
Since the overthrow of strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, several groups have launched attacks in the country.

Though the tunnel would cost a lot of money to build, it would also help improve the economy, John Cridland, Chairman of Transport for the North, said in the same statement from the Department of Transport.
Veteran 60's rocker Paul Revere gives a hug to Vietnam veteran Gary Ryska on the steps of city hall in Nampa, Idaho, during a press conference. Revere, born Paul Revere Dick, the organist and leader of the Raiders rock band, died Saturday at his home in Idaho. (Jeremy Harmon/Associated Press) "From Day 1, we've always been a party band that accidentally had some hit records and accidentally got on a hit television series," Revere told The Associated Press in a 2000 interview.Revere, born Paul Revere Dick, became known as "the madman of rock and roll" for his theatrical colonial wardrobe and infectious onstage persona with the band.
Shogo Ban, a college student from Fukuoka, likes to cook. Thanks to the owner of the restaurant where he works part-time, he finds himself working at the line of Roppongi's best Italian restaurant, Trattoria Baccanale, and discovers that the real deal isn't quite as easy as he'd thought. The manga follows Ban as he struggles to keep up with the hectic workload and his co-workers, along with issues outside the kitchen like his relationship with his girlfriend Eri, who he left behind in Fukuoka. Bambino! received the 2008 Shogakukan Manga Award for seinen/general manga along with Takeshi Natsuhara's and Kuromaru's Kurosagi.
The warning comes after the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said relations between the US and China – re-established by Chairman Mao and Richard Nixon in 1972 – had reached “a pivot point” after more than four decades of “no conflict”.
Ronda AG makes the movements (i.e. all the internal pieces) in Switzerland. Each movement consists of about 46 to more than 100 pieces, all of which are shipped to Detroit loose then hand assembled by about two dozen people. Above, a craftsman is making modifications so the watches will hold larger batteries. At present, all watches need to be sent back to Shinola for battery replacement, but they're working on authorizing resellers to provide that service.
"I want to make sure that this isn't a case of mistaken identity, like I explained to the gentleman when I was taken in to the jail house, they had my social transcribed incorrectly and also I wasn't read my Miranda rights," Hulsey said.
Bangladesh made the two new balls count. Mashrafe Mortaza, who took three wickets, bowled two good spells to make sure New Zealand's required run-rate never went down. Offspinner Sohag Gazi took the other new ball, and like Mashrafe, tied down the batsmen at first before picking up three wickets. Mominul Haque was Mushfiqur Rahim's golden arm, removing the McCullum brothers.
Bangladesh, on the other hand, were off to a better start with the bat, but none of their batsmen pushed on for a big score. The New Zealand bowlers were accurate and controlled their bowling variations. The Bangladesh batsmen had to be patient, but were often frustrated as they could not get on top of the medium-pacers. Brendon McCullum set planned fields, packing the off side and to his credit, he was backed by the bowlers and the fielders.
The top and middle-order batsmen threw away good starts. The openers, Tamim Iqbal and the debutant Shamsur Rahman began steadily with a stand of 63. Tamim was the enforcer, but the debutant Shamsur was relatively sedate during his 25. Tamim drove stylishly through the covers and his only six, down the ground off Southee in the ninth over, was his best shot.
Soon after, Tamim got stuck in the forties for 18 balls, before reaching his 25th ODI fifty off 75 balls. He was finally dismissed by inside edging Anderson's slower ball onto his stumps, after missing on several wild swishes. As the sun set below Mirpur's horizon, the home crowd looked disappointed that the batsmen failed to capitalise, but the mood changed as the evening wore on.
Batting is an area that still needs improvement, but with an inspired bowling performance such as this, Mushfiqur need not give himself and the rest of the batsmen the hair-dryer. With cricket being one of the unifying factors in the country, celebrations are expected everywhere.

What has become ever more apparent in recent weeks and months is that the conflict in Syria is much larger than Syria itself. Like the Balkans almost exactly 100 years ago, Syria has become the proverbial powder keg in which Western leaders play with matches. Tragically, the diplomatic brinksmanship of the imperial powers in 1914 unleashed upon the world one of the greatest tragedies in the history of humanity: the First World War. As the United States prepares to commence yet another war, let us hope that world war is not once again the outcome.

What evidence could D2's accusers possibly have provided to prove the three disqualified team members weren't gay? Did they bring in old boyfriends or ask Broadway trivia questions? Is there a penis-to-pussy eating ratio that designates whether one of us is LG or B? No, attraction is intangible and trying to quantify it is absurd and dehumanizing.
The Calgary Flames have been the best story in the NHL this season, and a lot of their success has been attributed to the outstanding individual performances from the likes of defenseman Mark Giordano, and youngsters Johnny Gaudreau and Sean Monahan. While yes, those players have put together tremendous campaigns for themselves, it's veteran Czech forward Jiri Hudler that has turned out to be the most valuable Flame over the past month, and should Calgary hold on and punch their ticket to the postseason, it shouldn't be out-worldly to consider Hudler a dark horse Hart Trophy candidate.
Athletic Ability Like his father, who gave him his first football at the age of three, Vick showed an early talent for the game. At Warwick High School, Vick grew close to the football team's coach, Tommy Reamon, a former World Football League star. Reamon pushed Vick to work on his passing skills and hit the weight room to add bulk to his skinny frame. Plagued by a weak offensive line, Reamon encouraged Vick to take advantage of his blazing speed by scrambling out of the QB pocket and improvising the team's offense. Vick flourished under his coach's tuteledge and by his senior year, Vick, who throws left but is actually right-handed, was considered one of the top high school quarterbacks in the country. Turning down an offer to go to Syracuse University, Vick chose to stay closer to home and sign on with Virginia Tech in nearby Blacksburg. There, the highly touted Vick did not disappoint. After redshirting his freshmen year, the 19-year-old quarterback led the Hokies to an undefeated season and a spot in the Sugar Bowl where they fell against Florida State in the national title game. Vick was named the Big East's Offensive Player of the Year, and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting. Vick and the Virginia Tech team slipped down in the rankings the following year, but the National Football League scouts drooled at the prospect of seeing the QB—a 6-foot 1-inch, quarterback who could chuck the ball 80 yards—on the pro stage. His athletic prowess even caught the attention of Major League Baseball, and in the 2000 MLB draft the Colorado Rockies selected Vick in the 30th round, this despite the fact that he hadn't even played the game since he was 14.
The song was written in 1968 by Sherman Kelly,[1][2] whose brother, Wells Kelly – King Harvest's drummer – introduced the song to the band. It was originally recorded in 1969 by the American band Boffalongo, which included Sherman Kelly (singing lead on the original recording of his own composition)[3] and future King Harvest frontman Doc Robinson. Wells Kelly later became the original drummer for Orleans. Meanwhile, while based in Paris, King Harvest recorded and released "Dancing in the Moonlight" as a single with "Lady, Come On Home" on the B side. Steve Cutler, a jazz drummer from New York City (standing on the base of the pole in the cover picture), plays drums on the tracks and toured with the band in France and the UK. The group disbanded after six months and the single languished for a year until it was bought and released worldwide by Perception Records.
"It's been a long time coming," said defenseman Dan Kelly, the only player to be with Kowalsky for his entire Albany stay. "It's always good when you've been with a guy to see him get rewarded. We've got a great team this year, and he's done a great job managing it."
Should an acquisition be in the books? Whether such an event is to take place or not, Asustek Chief Financial Officer David Chang has told Reuters it's not something the company is entirely ruling out. He mentions Chairman Jonney Shih touched on the topic at ASUS' annual general meeting.
But in the days since, things have gone uphill for the Rangers defense core. They've allowed two goals or fewer in seven of their last 10 games, contributions offensively have been easier to find in recent days, and there are seven capable defensemen competing for the six open positions. It certainly isn't a bad problem to have, and we'll first start by talking about the “coming out party” that this season has been for Kevin “Optimus Klein-Kleisenberg” Klein.
The 30-year-old defenseman has also become the Rangers' biggest offensive threat at the blue line, as Klein has eight goals on the season in just 43 games (his previous season-high in goals was four).
Beyond Klein, the Rangers have also been fortunate enough to have a pretty good problem on their hands; good at least compared to what problems they could have to deal with, and that is the fact that the Blueshirts have seven capable defensemen for the six open positions, thanks to the solid consistent play from both Matt Hunwick and John Moore.
When health is at a maximum, the top-four at the Ranger blue line is occupied by McDonagh, Girardi, Staal, and Boyle. As far as top-four's go, that really isn't half bad. And then there's Kevin Klein, who we've already outlined as having a career year, and could probably fill in as a top-four defenseman on many other teams. He is in the fifth slot on the Ranger blue line.
Glasgow led the dominant performance by Michigan's defense with a stout game against the run (83.5) and his best pass rushing effort of the season with a ridiculous sack, QB hit, two hurries, and batted pass on only 16 rushes. Vanderdoes returns to the team after posting the week's top run-stopping grade at 89.4 as he continues to quickly shed blocks and disrupt the run game like few interior defensive linemen in the nation.
Other options for that hitter the Cardinals want can be found on the infield, possibly if Toronto makes third baseman Josh Donaldson available for trade or if the Cardinals pursue free-agent first baseman Eric Hosmer.
The Pittsburgh Penguins have activated defenseman Kris Letang from injured reserve, according to an announcement by the team on Tuesday afternoon.
In order to make room for Letang, the team assigned defenseman Simon Despres to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League. In 24 games this season, Despres had registered two goals and five assists for seven points.

The Sporting Statues Project was started, in 2010, by Chris Stride and John Wilson, two statisticians at the University of Sheffield, and Ffion Thomas, who is pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Central Lancashire's International Football Institute. Four years ago, Stride ran a study that counted and categorized every incident of cheating during the 2010 World Cup. After that, he got to wondering about the many soccer statues he saw in the U.K. To compile their global list, Stride and Thomas spoke to sculptors, football historians, and museum curators around the world and searched Google in multiple languages. The two have become statuary scholars, publishing on subjects such as “Honoring Heroes by Branding in Bronze: Theorizing the UK's Football Statuary” and “The Thierry Henry Statue: A Hollow Icon?” (They've also built databases of all the known statues related to baseball, cricket, and Britain's sportsmen and women.)

For one thing, compared to Goth Lolita model / pop idol Misa Amane in the Japanese version of Death Note, Mia is much less glamorous, less of a Light fangirl and more manipulative and dark, with her own agenda. The differences in personality and personal agency between cutesy, submissive Misa and suburban anti-heroine Mia send this movie's plot on a different trajectory. While many elements of the manga are here, it's clear that Ohba and Obata's story was used as a launching point, not as a shot-by-shot guide for the entire film.
If it looks like a stork, walks like a stork … it's probably a foreign spy. This, at least, was the conclusion of an Egyptian fisherman who took patriotic exception to a migratory bird near his home in Qena, southern Egypt.
Spotting an unlikely metallic device attached to the stork and suspecting it contained a camera – or worse – the fisherman concluded the stork was a spy acting on behalf of foreign powers.

Much of that increase was attributed to Oronhyatekha's powers of persuasion. His brash, self-promotional nature was compared to showman P.T. Barnum. Following the order's move to Toronto in 1888, it presented lavish displays at the Toronto Industrial Exhibition (the forerunner of the CNE). He travelled the world to build up the IOF, even if many of the new lodges he opened outside the order's core regions of Canada, Great Britain, and the United States faltered after his death. His speeches and writings stressed the importance of brotherhood and supporting each other through hard times. “He was always elegant and faultlessly groomed,” noted Ethel Brant Monture in her book Canadian Portraits: Famous Indians. “People sought him, for his friendliness was unbounded. His conversation is said to have sparkled with his knowledge of man and books. In a social gathering of congenial friends it was his delight to start the group singing. His strong baritone voice never tired and in his enthusiasm he would catch up a plate or a book and tap on it like a tom-tom to carry the beat.” His debating skills were also praised: “Calm, courteous, imperturbable, clear and decisive, he is a master in debate,” one English writer observed. “His weapon is as smooth and decisive as a Damascus scimitar; his dexterity in wielding it, and his quickness in watching the fence of an opponent are extraordinary and admirable.”
My girlfriend doesn't get on with my cat, at all – crazy right?
…once you commit to making a piece for a client, or a family member, that responsibility is there, to those people. It's your job to make sure your design and your workmanship serve the needs and desires of your clients, and that the techniques and materials you use serve those ends. Anything else is superfluous, and runs the risk of being dangerous, or at best, ugly.”
The trio of North Carolina underclassmen had been ensnared in draft speculation over the last several weeks, inundated in conflicting rumors about which way each one was leaning.
“A little dickish” could be on Deadpool's business cards. Not long after his first appearance in 1991, Deadpool became the Marvel universe's cheerfully obnoxious court jester, infuriating both heroes and villains with a stream of pop-culture references and constant fourth-wall breaking. There is a teardrop of tragedy behind the red face mask, teased out in the movie in the relationship between loyal soldier Wade Wilson and his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Wade only becomes Deadpool to combat his terminal cancer, undergoing experimental superhero surgery organised by shady powerbroker Ajax (Ed Skrein). The treatments result in accelerated internal super-healing, making the so-called Merc With A Mouth essentially unkillable, though Deadpool's face and body are left horribly scarred and covered with lesions (“Like a cross between Ryan Reynolds and a Shar-Pei,” quipped the character, with unexpected clairvoyance, in a 2004 issue).
While Deadpool is motivated to start slicing up bad guys when his girlfriend is kidnapped by Ajax, Miller described him as “pansexual” late last year, which generated some heated debate about whether Deadpool was the first gay superhero to make it to the screen. “I think that was a result of me not being that experienced with the way that the media worked,” says Miller. “We really explore his relationship with Vanessa in the movie but there's nothing that says he wouldn't explore other relationships. In my mind, he's always been pansexual and I wanted to be true to the way he is in the comics.”
Still, in a year groaning with star-jammed comic-book movies – including Captain America: Civil War, Batman v Superman and X-Men Apocalypse – the squirrelly Deadpool risks being squeezed out. “We shot on a third of the budget of most superhero movies but, y'know, you just make it happen,” says Miller. The Merc With A Mouth does have the advantage of being first out of the gate in 2016, crucially arriving ahead of Suicide Squad, DC's broadly similar mob of volatile antiheroes. Where does Miller think Deadpool slots into such a crowded field?
Their recruiting targets will likely include two Staten Island Democrats — state Sen. Diane Savino and state Assemblyman Michael Cusick — who might fit the district better than off-Island candidates like Recchia and Gentile. Neither state lawmaker responded to requests for comment on Monday.
While the media speculates about Snowden's motives and allegiances and salary and pontificates about his dancer girlfriend and if she's feeling lonely, Snowden's supporters seem to grasp that this story is about something bigger.
It was said that the pit was home to some horrific, reptilian beast that would emerge to terrify the local tribes. Apparently somewhat like a dinosaur in appearance, the creature's appetite was said to be ravenous, and that it would ferociously hunt and kill whatever it could catch, including human beings. The tribes spoke of how beastly howls, wailing, and roaring could often be heard emanating from the depths of the hole. One tribe, the Ila, had allegedly become so distressed by the horror from the pit that a group of tribesmen is tied together and flung into the craggy black hole as a sacrifice in an attempt to appease the monster that lurked within.
The expedition saw no strange monsters or unusual wildlife in or around the pit, and heard no monstrous roaring, but the guide insisted that they were there, as did other tribesmen of the vicinity. The chief of the Barotse tribe, a man known as Lewanki, told Worthington on several occasions of a strange beast he had seen in the marshes near the Forbidden Pit. The New Zealand Guardian, October 17, 1925, issue 19151, reported that the chief had seen:
The chief claimed that the monster on occasion crawled from its lair within the pit to prowl the surrounding swamps and marshes. Worthington was unable to find any evidence of such a creature in the marshes either, but the native stories persisted, and whatever it was that supposedly lurked in the depths of the Forbidden Pit had clearly frightened them. Many tribesmen were afraid to even speak of the monster. It was difficult to get anyone to go anywhere near the place, guides were hard to come by, and the expedition members were repeatedly warned to stay back.
Gessen and Taibbi are right that many people have too high an expectation for the Russia story, seeing it as a magic bullet that will destroy the Trump presidency. At its most extreme, the story has led to unhinged conspiracy theories that Trump is a Manchurian candidate controlled by the Kremlin. Conservative journalist Louise Mensch, for instance, suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin had Andrew Breitbart murdered in 2012 so that Steve Bannon, now Trump's chief strategist, could take over the media outlet. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, said that it's “absolutely true” that the Russians have a compromising tape of Trump with prostitutes. (She later retreated from the claim.)
Even after Dewitt's delusional behavior began, Diaz was able to maintain a relationship with his friend and still do things like go out to eat and socialize, he says. "He'd be a cool person to hang out with," said Diaz. When Dewitt started talking about his imaginary girlfriend Zoey, Diaz would "go along with it."
TWP Chairman Matthew Heimbach said that his group organized the rally along with a group called Golden State Skinheads, and blamed the violence on “leftist radicals,” according to the LA Times. He added that one of his group's members had been stabbed in the neck, but that the others injured were with the counterprotestors.

By the end of the 1500s, the word also referred to a similar experience in a political context, meaning a short-lived period of goodwill that exists before a relationship turns bad. Take, for example, a series of lectures about British statesmen by Goldwin Smith from 1867, where he refers to "the brief honeymoon of the new king and his parliament," a moment before Parlimentarian John Pym hadn't yet decided that Charles I should be arrested.
Carrie Jean Melvin and her boyfriend were walking through their Hollywood neighborhood on their way to get some food when someone walked up behind them, aimed a shotgun at her head and pulled the trigger.
On Monday, the motive for the brazen attack the night before remained as mysterious as the gunman. An LAPD homicide detective said investigators were still trying to determine why Melvin, 30, was shot and not other people who were on the street at the time. Her boyfriend was unharmed, police said.

“When it became obvious to the crowd that Bob was not there, immediately some buzz started. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he didn't show up because of a personal issue. I figured there was no way that he'd stand Congressman Paul up.” “I went to Bob's press conference still a supporter and still assuming the best. When the real reason he didn't show up became apparent, I thought ‘What the f#@k?'. That's when he lost my support.” “Barr showed us today that he is not a team player for liberty. Barr is far more concerned about votes than he is promoting liberty and the Constitution. There's a time to lead and a time to follow; today was a day to folllow Dr. Paul- to show some unity. Barr missed his opportunity and lost my vote.”
Daryush ‘Roosh' Valizadeh, the US-based male supremacist and self-styled pick-up artist who leads anti-woman group Return of Kings, has announced plans for meet-ups in 165 cities all around the world from Australia to the UK.
Shiakallis began photographing these Queens in their homes, a project that proved more difficult than he'd expected. “Every portrait I took almost never happened,” Shiakallis says. “Sometimes, the Queens' boyfriends or husbands would thwart the shoots,” since they didn't want their partners to be photographed by, or even in the presence of, another male. “Some Queens were reluctant to pose for photographs, wary about where the images would end up, as they're still ‘coming out' as rockers.”
In bullet belts, spiked cuffs, leather jackets, bandanas, and Iron Maiden t-shirts, the women in Shiakallis' photographs resemble characters from post-apocalyptic cinema, like the road warriors from Mad Max. Marok fashion fuses the styles of 1970s and '80s heavy metal (specifically, from the cover of Motorhead's Ace of Spades); the tasseled leather jackets and black boots of Botswana's sizeable biker community; and the cowboy hats, spurs, and vests worn by many of the country's rural farmers. Posing against backdrops of rural villages, pastel-painted bedrooms, and cozy living rooms, these Queens highlight how the Marok subculture is a kind of fantasy world, an escape from the confines of tradition and domesticity.
This anonymous plan is . . . likely . . . an English copy of a map made for the Dutch authorities in 1661 by Jacques Cortelyou which may have been handed over to the English by the last Dutch governor, Pieter Stuyvesant following his surrender of the town in September 1664. This map of New York may well have been created from the original Dutch map by one of several draughtsmen living in alleys in the docklands east of the Tower of London who specialised in decorative chart-making. English ships can be clearly seen in the harbour emphasisng their victory over the Dutch. The town wall, that was to give its name to Wall Street and the Battery (or fortification), the site of which is now covered by Battery Park, can also be identified. The map's name recalls its presentation to the Duke of York, the future James II, at the time when he was being asked for permission for the town to be renamed after him. The map formed part of the royal map collection from then on, eventually being incorporated into the geographical collections assembled by George III. These were presented to the British Museum, with George III's library, in the course of the 1820s.

Al Salvi with former law partner, Congressman Peter Roskam (R-IL)
When my marriage ended after eighteen years, I found myself tossed back into the dating pool. Not an easy task for a fortysomething female. To put it in the nicest terms possible, the relationships that followed weren't, um, noteworthy. The straw that broke this camel's back was the boyfriend that lied about his entire life and got arrested for shoplifting just before Christmas. That's when I decided to take my pathetic ass online to find a man.
Clinton on Monday was far less confrontational and far more the elder statesmen who have seen and done it before, having been President during the last federal government shut downs in 1995 and 1996.
A second favored rebuttal is to point to individual Democratic politicians' sexual misconduct – Anthony Weiner, Bob Filner – and to take the conversation as far away from policy as possible. That was also tough to bring up on a day where equal pay debates were crowded out by footage of a Republican congressman kissing a subordinate. That woman no longer has a job, while the Congressman still has his. That's one solution to the gender wage gap.

The only problem is that Jack goes from unassuming everyman to heat-packing superhero in the space of the first few hours, and his relatively rapid ascent to gun-toting Time Lord is to Quantum Break's slight detriment as a whole. Since it seems to be in such a rush to give you all these neat powers up front, it leaves nothing new in reserve for the entire second half, which means the initial freshness of these frozen-in-time firefights starts to feel somewhat stale long before you reach the conclusion after 10 hours.
Hey there everyone,I have been saving this picture for a while now hoping I'd have some time to create a few more shots that would match this one in some kind of series. I've not been able to really land the idea in a result I'm happy with. I will keep trying of course but since I am moving soon I figured I would post it already.It is one of those pictures that grew somewhat organically. I worked out where everything was supposed to go as I was looking through the lens and making everything match and work out. Those are the most fun to do because you can really make something great step by step.This picture also features several of the yeomen I've been working on and that are now almost finished.I named it: Cold SteelThis is one of my absolute favorites so far.

The floodgates had opened. The clashes that followed defined the new terms of encounters between a politicized version of Islam — awakened to both power and vulnerability — and the West's culture of protecting and nurturing free speech. In 2004, a Moroccan Dutchman in his mid-20s, Mohammed Bouyeri, murdered filmmaker Theo van Goghon a busy Amsterdam street after van Gogh and a Somali-born politician made a short film about the abuse of women in Islamic culture.
“If you actually look at the data, you can't just condense it into a sound bite. It's more nuanced than that,'' says John Pryor, director of the UCLA Cooperative Institutional Research program, which produces an annual national survey of hundreds of thousands of college freshmen on which Twenge and her colleagues based their latest study.
Among other things, Twenge and her colleagues found that a larger percentage of incoming college freshmen rated themselves as “above average'' in several categories compared with college freshmen who were surveyed in the 1960s.
When it came to social self-confidence, about half of freshmen questioned in 2009 said they were above average, compared with fewer than a third in 1966. Meanwhile, 60 percent in 2009 rated their intellectual self-confidence as above average, compared with 39 percent in 1966, the first year the survey was given.
In 1990, when the question was first asked in the survey, about 17 percent of college freshmen said there was a very good chance that they would participate in public service in college. In 2010, nearly a third of freshmen said the same.

According to the 1599 treatise Paradoxes of Defence by the English gentleman George Silver, the glaive is used in the same general manner as the quarterstaff, half pike, bill, halberd, voulge, or partisan. Silver rated this class of polearms above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons.
Everyone's very surprised, pleased, and grateful. The selectmen have been meeting with department heads and committee chairmen and will continue to do so to figure out the best plan for how to invest the money and how to best use it.
Well, we've been very fortunate. We received another very large gift a couple years ago by a gentleman named Peter Paul, whose father was born in town. That gift enabled us to build a full community center. We kind of feel Betty's gift will go toward the continuation of that, helping to pay for programming and activities for the children. A large part will be into savings for things like renovation of the town hall and other town buildings. There are plenty of ways to use it.
Yoda started as rough sketches that were finalized in a clay sculpt by Stuart Freeborn who, rumor has it, modeled Yoda's features after his own. Whenever there was a collaboration with the English craftsman the design tended to evolve a little more than the homegrown ILM designs.

According to a wide range of reports, several nuclear bombs were “lost” for 36 hours after taking off August 29/30, 2007 on a “cross-country journey” across the U.S., from U.S.A.F Base Minot in North Dakota to U.S.A.F. Base Barksdale in Louisiana. Reportedly, in total there were six W80-1 nuclear warheads armed on AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles (ACMs) that were “lost.” The story was first reported by the Military Times, after military servicemen leaked the story, reported Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya.

Chairman and CEO Jeff Fettig joined Whirlpool in 1981 as an operation associate and worked his way up the Whirlpool ranks over the years. It's great to know that when you buy Whirlpool products (like I do) that the CEO of the company actually cares about the country where his company is based, which is evident when he said, “Our U.S. presence is, and always will be, the foundation of our global enterprise. We are very confident in the future of U.S. manufacturing and proud to have more U.S. manufacturing employees than all of our major competitors combined.”

After a brief prologue calibrated to set nerves jangling and establish the stakes, we're introduced to a well-adjusted suburban teenager named Jamie (Maika Monroe), who's amusing herself before a date with a new boyfriend by swimming in her backyard pool and hanging out with her Dostoyevsky-reading sister, and a nerdy childhood friend named Paul (Keir Gilchrist) who's had a crush on Jamie since grade school. He's pretending to be completely absorbed in a silly '50s horror flick on TV, while casting lingering glances her way, but there's nothing troubled about what we see of them. They're easygoing — recognizably normal.

They found Gator about a half a mile from where they live.
Blog wars? The Generalissimo will be merciful. It would ill behoove the junta to be settling personal grudges and besides, our manpower will be strained to its limits, rounding up Women's Studies majors and feminist Tumblr bloggers, giving them a few days' training, loading them onto C-130s and dropping them by parachute into places like Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, etc., as part of our effort to bring about world peace.
Ultimately, the glee with which the press jumps on each of these quotes is testament to just how bland and humourless the rest of the pop and rock pack is today, whether it's Justin Bieber's burbling 12-step enlightenment, Katy Perry's relentless solipsism or walking Fat Face moodboard Ed Sheeran getting prickly at people on social media. These are stars who can't square their off-stage image with their on-stage personas, and chase a version of their authentic selves down an endless corridor. Liam however is that rare beast: a truly charismatic frontman whose id and ego get the beers in rather than squabble.
“Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads,” Cruz said. “I give you my word, if I am elected President, no serviceman or servicewoman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.”

Some Republicans in Congress are worried they won't be able to control the future Congressmen and Senators that the Tea Party might be sending to Washington.
As to the second concern, the impact of the “Tea Party” Congressmen and Senators on their respective institutions depends largely on how many of them there are. On the Senate side, it would seem that they're unlikely to amount to much more than a strong obstructionist bloc within the GOP, which will likely still be the minority party in the Upper House. In the House, it depends on how large any Republican majority turns out to be (if there is one). If the GOP only holds the House by a handful of votes, then the ability of a “Tea Party” Caucus to influence the agenda is going to be hampered by both their relative lack of seniority, and the leaderships need to court Democratic votes on many pieces of legislation.
A Web site fan (David Schaeffer) wrote in and here's his opinion: In their prime, Ali would have beat Tyson. I think people look at Ali in the later years 75'-81', when they compare. You have to go to when he beat Sonny Liston, before the draft issue. That was Ali at his best. Even the Frazier, Norton, Foreman fights were not peak Ali. Ali after his three year layoff, was never as good. Still good enough to be champed though.
Ranch Diaries: Why cowboy life is intense We have other interests, like art and cooking, that take a backseat to the needs of our land and animals.
It's hard for Sam and me to find time to do anything outside of ranching, but it's especially challenging during the fall, one of the busiest times of year. While we're cowboys and ranchers now to most people, we have other interests that take a backseat to the needs of our land and animals. I'm often hesitant to tell other ranchers what I like to do that's not cattle related. But in addition to being a rancher I'm also an artist. I just started taking a painting class at the community college in Ruidoso on Wednesday afternoons. Next summer, I'll graduate from Vermont College of Fine Arts with an MFA in Fiction Writing — I've been balancing coursework with ranch work for over a year now. I love to cook, garden, and gather wild foods. Recently, I took a few afternoons to harvest piñon nuts, wild cherries, black walnuts and prickly pears. Pulling the last batch of wild black cherry jelly out of the water bath canner yesterday felt so good. I was reconnecting with a long family tradition of preserving food and appreciating the bounty of the landscape I'm part of. I like hiking and printmaking. I love art museums — I'm an Egon Shiele fan — and going to the movies.
My freshman year of college at Villanova, I told myself, “it's four years, just fake it” because now that I was a Division I swimmer I really thought I couldn't be out. That was not the case. As much as I tried to hide my boyfriend during freshman year from my teammates, it was inevitable they were going to find out.
My freshman year I became extremely close to the seniors and juniors on my swim team. I was this little freshman who got to hang out with people I looked up to and wanted to be like. They all had girlfriends and in my eyes I wanted that too. I wanted to fit in with my friends.
Axel had a boyfriend while at Villanova so he got to see how it was to have a “normal” life with a guy. During this time Josh would sneak around when drunk with one guy at school but both were deep in the closet. It took a toll on Josh and he was jealous that Axel could have a normal life.
To answer the question of whether this lifestyle is worth it, my simple response is HELL YES it's worth it. The single most important reason why is because for this brief period in my life I am truly experiencing ultimate freedom. While FREEDOM is a frequently used term in our great “Land of the Free, Home of the Brave” take a step back and analyze your life to see how free you actually are. Ask yourself this question. If your best friend offered you a one-way ticket to a country halfway around the world tomorrow to go live for an indeterminate amount of time with them, could you accept their invitation? The answer is probably no. There are a number of factors that would inhibit your ability to just leave this world tomorrow for an adventure. The most obvious reason is your job. Even if you have money in the bank, you can't risk losing your job in an economy like this one. You probably have an apartment or a house that you need to sell or sublet. That house is probably full of furniture, a TV, and lots of other things that you don't really need. You may have car payments, credit card debt, student loans that need to be paid off. A spouse or girlfriend wouldn't be too happy if you just took off one day… Maybe you have a dog, cat or even children that need to be taken care of. Beyond material things what about expectation from your parents, peers or even yourself?
The Red Wings selected defenseman Benjamin Marshall (5-foot-9, 160) from Mahtonedi (Minn.) High School with their final pick in the seventh round (201st overall).
It came in a box... A box with a lot of sticky tape all over it. Much more sticky tape than it should've. That's because AQIS opened it to check for contraband or drugs or something. Probably more due to the craftsmanship of the contents. Australian customs are pretty finnicky when it comes to things made from wood. The first thing I saw amongst the shredded brown paper was bubblewrap. What could be in said bubblewrap? A groovy painted wooden horse! he's sitting on my desktop computer tower. He's also got a partner in crime. His friend the mouse! I shall call them Louie and Squeak! Louie is the mouse!
The fact that those responsible for this attack, first and foremost CIA Director John Brennan, face no legal consequences only confirms the de facto rule of the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, in the service of the financial elite, and the reduction of the presidency and Congress to the role of frontmen and rubber stamps.

My girlfriend said, “I hate it when you finish my sentences.” So I said, “Period.”
Though this year is considered to be a weak draft class at guard, there is NFL level talent coming out at tackle. Laremy Tunsil out of Old Miss is the top rated offensive linemen coming out of the draft. Tunsil is 6'5″, 310 pounds. Before the recent trade with the Rams, it was rumored that Tunsil may go at pick number one to the Tennessee Titans. Tunsil has a great skill set for the NFL. He has a natural knee bend, quickness, and agility. He would be a great blind side blocker if he falls to pick seven for the 49ers. Notre Dame standout Ronnie Stanley had a great performance at the combine, and would be a good fit at right tackle. Stanley has all the strength and athleticism to be a Pro Bowl player in the league, and is a great pass protector. Another player at the top of most linemen rankings is Joshua Garnett from Stanford. Garnett has the ability to be a great pulling guard and run blocker, which could be useful in a Chip Kelly style offense. Garnett does need to add some upper body strength, but lifted well on bench press at the combine, and should be there for the 49ers to take at pick seven.
Unger was injured for much of the season, and his backups—Lemuel Jeanpierre and Patrick Lewis—struggled, especially as pass blockers. Still, Unger was easily the best lineman on the team when he was in the game, and he managed to be healthy for the playoffs. It is hard to imagine the Seahawks making it back to their second straight Super Bowl without him. The Super Bowl appearance masked some serious cracks in the foundation. Scoring dropped a couple of points from the year before. Russell Wilson saw his passer rating (95.0) drop below 100.0 for the first time in his career, and his passing touchdowns total (20) was significantly lower than his first two years (26 in each). His rushing yards exploded, adding 300 yards to his previous high, but that's not necessarily a good thing.
Many of you know I came out strongly against the trade of Unger for Graham. In general, I abhor trading core lineman on either side of the ball for skill players. At the time, I also questioned whether Graham had any place in a Seahawks locker room defined by grit and genuine toughness. He quickly dispelled the second question, but the first remains.
One lesson that I hope Seattle has learned through this process is that their evaluation process for offensive lineman needs to be overhauled. Since Cable joined the team, they have added this lineman: One lesson that I hope Seattle has learned through this process is that their evaluation process for offensive lineman needs to be overhauled. Since Cable joined the team, they have added this lineman: Robert Gallery
Patrick Lewis I respect Cable's ability to make chicken salad out of chicken $!%*, but it is okay to put a filet on the menu once-in-a-while. To lay it all at Cable's feet would be unfair. You can be sure he would have likely prioritized keeping players like Giacomini, Carpenter and Unger which would make this line look quite different. Schneider rightly has tried to save some money there to bolster the team elsewhere. His trade of Unger for Graham may have been more than his offensive line coach could repair. A team that prides itself on running the football needs to invest more in the lineman who clear the path. With Russell Okung and J.R. Sweezy both scheduled to hit the free agent market next year, this could get a whole lot worse if the Seahawks do not turn this demolition project into a renovation.
If we remove those names the lineup is what I've got below, with 27 players left in camp. That will be cut down to 23. We're almost certain to see one more defenseman cut since general manager Chuck Fletcher has said he doesn't want to keep both Matt Dumba and Christian Folin if they aren't getting games. He'd rather have them in Iowa where they're continuing to develop.

While Kool-Aid advertising featured talking anthropomorphic pitchers as far back as the 1950s, the pitcher pitchman really came into his own when he made the transition to television. In his first appearance, the Kool-Aid Man made one of his famous burst-through-a-wall entrances to help quench the thirst of kids at a bowling alley. The character would undergo tweaks—gaining arms, dropping the name “Pitcher Man”—but the spot established the Kool-Aid Man's basic formula. Kids would say they were thirsty while enjoying some athletic activity, one kid would call, “Hey, Kool-Aid,” and the Kool-Aid Man would burst through a fence or wall and yell, “Oh yeah!” Audiences loved it so much that in 2000, the Kool-Aid Man got to leave his footprints in front of Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood.

Alina and Voichita have been friends since their orphanage days. And they have been lovers since they became sexually mature. But despite their oath of mutual fidelity, Alina, who could not bear poverty any more, emigrated to Germany where she became a barmaid. Now she just could not take the estrangement from Voichita and today she is back to Romania with a view to taking Voichita along with her to Germany. The only trouble is that in the meantime her girlfriend has betrayed her in falling in love with... God! Voichita indeed now lives in a convent where she plans to make vows. The priest agrees, if somewhat reluctantly, to accommodate Alina before their (hypothetical) departure. He sees all too well that not only is the young woman materialistic but hostile and troublesome as well... Written by Guy Bellinger
Looking back 50 years, I am always amazed at the significant advances mankind has made as a result of the space race with Soviet Russia — calculators, computers, internet, among many. Mankind seems to excel when in competition, whether at war, in commerce or in the arts. The rudimentary equipment half a century ago could not even compare with the precision of our digital age. Many of the technologies we now take for granted were pioneered by the men and women of Project Mercury. Those that followed in their wake made American pre-eminence in technology possible.

We don't really believe that feminists are all man-hating harpies. It's a cliché of a cliché. Perhaps it's just the rise in social media, but the loudest voices are confrontational and critical; this, in turn, causes a similar reaction at the other end of the spectrum who #notallmen wish to be represented by – men like Mike Buchanan, who hand out "Lying Feminist of the Month" awards, who make excuses for convicted rapists, and are the equal and opposite reaction to “toxic feminism”.
That level of passion seems to be present in many who study Strad violins, never mind those who play them, like Joshua Bell (although a delusional Jen-Luc Piquant swears his passion for her trumps even his love for his Strad). The Cremona craftsman would no doubt find this quite gratifying.
Marking the thirteenth stop of their thirty North American Fall tour dates (see dates below), passion for their trade, for their sound, was obviously flowing through this band. Forever embracing an intense crowd, frontman George Clarke ominously summoned the crowd to push forward numerous times. The result, if not obvious, was a movement filled, angsty pit. Surrounding it were more demure fans banging their heads in approval. And amongst this madness and intensity, guitarist Kerry McCoy, relaxed as ever, song after song.

Thursday's events brought broad criticism from political leaders and the public alike, with concerns that further escalation may cause deaths. This independent video shows police abusing students under arrest and firing potentially fatal rubber bullets as protesters then took to the streets, as well as reactions from the public affected by the mayhem. When the arrests began, the students were sitting on the ground, arms locked, in civil disobedience, as they have appeared on most days over the course of the past two weeks at entrances to the main university campus. The subtitled interview with a student being arrested was filmed from under a car, where the cameraman had retreated when police blocked his filming.

All Expense Paid Trip For Ethically Challenged Assemblyman
Christie and Palatucci were the legislative agents for the University of Phoenix Online which was trying to get licensed in the state of New Jersey. As part of their effort they flew an assemblyman by the name of Rudy Garcia down to Phoenix, Arizona and wined and dined him in hopes of winning his support.
But unfortunately for Assemblyman Garcia the good times would not last as he's facing an investigation for corruption in his other job – being mayor of Union City. Previous to recent reforms New Jersey politicians were allowed to be both a local office holder and in the state legislature. Some still are thanks to a grandfather clause in the reform bill.
Today former Assemblyman Garcia is a registered lobbyist in Trenton.
England requires an allrounder to balance the side. With five specialist batsmen (Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen and Eoin Morgan), four specialist bowlers (James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann and Steven Finn) and a wicketkeeper (to be decided) all highly likely to feature at start the Champions Trophy in five months, it is clear that they require someone who can reliably provide another 10 overs and bat in either defensive or offensive fashion. Bopara may yet be that man.
This month's report has a bit of a goaltending theme to it, as we take a look at top goaltending prospect Thatcher Demko, as well as defenceman Guillaume Brisebois, who will forever be linked to former Canucks goaltender Eddie Lack. Lastly, we'll look at Jordan Subban, whose brother Malcolm is a goaltender in the Boston Bruins organization (you may have also heard of his older brother that plays for Montreal).
After my dad died, I became fixated on everyone else I love dying. I feared the old superstition that death comes in threes. I called my mom every day to make sure she was still alive, and I almost lost myself in the helplessness and fear of potentially losing my mom, sisters, boyfriend and everyone else I love. When you're highly sensitive, deep pain can often turn into deep fear of a similar event happening again. Our highly sensitive brains and our rich imaginations have developed to consider possible outcomes. Recognizing that this is a part of the emotional and mental processing for many who are highly sensitive can ease your fears and help you move through it without succumbing to it.
Empaths and Highly Sensitive People take on the emotions of others. Sometimes it's hard for us to distinguish between our own feelings and someone else's. My boyfriend stubs his toe outside in the yard and suddenly I feel a stabbing pain in my big toe, even though I'm reading in bed and can't see or hear him. When death sweeps through a family, your usual protective guard is down and you're suddenly overwhelmed by a vast mixture of emotions. It's hard to sort out what emotions are yours and what emotions you're taking in from others, so don't even try. Allow yourself to feel everything without judgment, criticism or filtering. It doesn't matter whose emotion it is, what matters is that you let it flow through so it can be released.
Iran has lashed out at the United States for supporting terrorist groups in the region, vowing to retaliate against any action targeting its Armed Forces, including the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC). The Iranian Armed Forces, including the IRGC, are the symbol of power and defenders of security and are supported by the Iranian government and nation, an informed source at Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday. The statement came a few hours before US President Donald Trump is expected to deliver a speech to criticize the nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries more than two years ago. “Any move against the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, will be met with Iran's fitting and strong response,” the statement added. It emphasized that Iran's core policy is to support regional peace and stability and confront any destabilizing and divisive measures aimed at creating tensions and conflicts in the region. The statement added that a resolute fight against terrorist groups such as Daesh was among the Islamic Republic's main priorities. “This is while, the US policies, particularly the country's support for terrorist groups and repressive regimes, are among the main factors behind instability in the region. The US cannot shirk its responsibility by leveling accusations against others and it must answer for its wrong policies,” it said. According to the statement, the US support for Israel and other “repressive” regimes in the region over the recent decades has caused war and conflicts on one hand and created “the ominous phenomenon of terrorism” on the other. The source warned the US that the continuation of its policy would be a “historic strategic mistake” and deal a heavy blow to the region and the entire world. Iran to boost defense power The statement reiterated the defensive and deterrent nature of Iran's missile program and said the country's missile capabilities have so far played an “effective” role in improving regional peace and stability. “The Islamic Republic of Iran is serious to maintain and boost its defensive and security capabilities, and in so doing, will only pay heed to its national security considerations and the interest of the Iranian people,” the Foreign Ministry statement pointed out. Iran's core and constant policy is to counter weapons of mass destruction across the world and take steps towards global disarmament, it said, adding that such a policy serves as the basis for the landmark nuclear deal. It emphasized that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as the only authorized supervisory body, has so far verified Iran's compliance with the JCPOA in eight reports, saying Washington's lack of commitment to its obligations and its repeated violation of the deal's “spirit and letter” were evident. Iran has a “very broad” range of options for any breach of the JCPOA and would “end all its commitments in this regard if deemed necessary,” the source added. The deal, agreed between Iran and the six permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — the United States, France, Britain, China and Russia – plus Germany lifts economic sanctions imposed in 2005 in exchange for curbs to Tehran's nuclear program. It was later endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Trump has called the deal an “embarrassment” to the US, and is expected to refuse to certify Iran's commitment to the deal during a White House speech later on Friday. If Trump refuses to certify the agreement, the US Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to restore the anti-Iran sanctions Washington has agreed to waive. The source also pointed to political differences between Iran and the US on many regional and international issues and said, “The main reason behind the US rulers' hostility towards Leader of the Islamic Revolution [Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei] is his anti-hegemony [stance] and explicit opposition to the US administration's regional and global policies… that resulted in nothing but bloodshed and misery for world nations.” The statement also advised the new US statesmen not to forget “lessons” of the past four decades. Despite the US hostile policies against Iran, including threats and sanctions, the Iranian nation has continued its patch to achieve independence and justice, it said.
An improving defense in front of an elite goaltender: New Jersey's defense is led by veteran Andy Greene, who's done a fine job working with young defensemen Adam Larsson, Eric Gelinas, Jon Merrill, Damon Severson and Seth Helgeson. The Devils were fifth in the NHL in shot attempts against (SATA) and sixth in SATA/60 in 2014-15.
Though ALEC has been shedding corporate members in recent months as the organization has come under increasing public scrutiny (at least 28 members have dropped so far this year), the tobacco industry has remained faithful. Reynolds American is a "President" level sponsor of ALEC's 2012 conference (which in 2010 cost $100,000) and Altria/Philip Morris is a "Chairman" level sponsor (which in 2010 cost $50,000). Additionally, former tobacco industry lobbyist W. Preston Baldwin III is the Chairman of ALEC's governing Private Enterprise Board, Reynolds America lobbyist David Powers is the Board's treasurer, and Altria lobbyist Daniel Smith is part of the Board's Executive Committee. Additionally, Philip Morris lobbyist Brandie Davis, the Private Sector Co-Chair of the ALEC International Relations Task Force, has been named a "Private Sector Member of the Year" for 2012.
The seven Norris Trophies as the best defenceman of his era and four Stanley Cups as a cornerstone of the Detroit Red Wings make him a mortal lock to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame on Monday in his first year of eligibility.
Lidstrom, who will likely be joined in the class of 2015 by former Red Wings teammate Sergei Fedorov and fellow dominant defenceman Chris Pronger, never missed more than 12 games in a season. He never missed more than six until he was 41 years old.
Only five defencemen recorded more: Ray Bourque, Paul Coffey, Al MacInnis, Phil Housley and Larry Murphy. All but Housley are already enshrined in the Hall of Fame, and the American blue-line leader is another strong candidate.
A lot of that was Lidstrom, the stable presence on the blue line who earned praise from former defenceman Sergei Zubov as "one of the greatest athletes" he played against.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said Monday that cryptocurrency and initial coin offerings (ICOs) hold substantially less investor protection than traditional securities markets, creating an environment ripe for scams and market manipulation. He urged investors to weigh those risks before making an investment.
Every able bodied free Avesian man is required to keep weapons, practice with them at least twice a year and when the need arises take up said weapons. With a high ratio of slaves to freemen in their small kingdom it's a necessity in case of servile revolt. Nowadays most make do with a musket (many of which are now made on the islands as a number of refugees from the Black Ports had managed to expand the local firearms industry considerably) and a mace, axe or dirk with a basic helmet. Those with more money generally have better equipment. Many consider the militia duties a chore outside of home defense while others take to it with enthusiasm, getting the best (or at the least showy) weapons and armor they can and putting in more than the minimum. Said groups are organized into militia companies led by members of noble houses. Many of said nobles have something of a historical bent to them and buy gear modeled on those made in the style of the First, Second or Third Empires or other historic powers. But regardless baring a few veterans, settled mercenaries and pirates and bar fights said forces are untested, both officers and men. Even those officers who focus a fair amount of time into the job are generally more playing at it.
Serving the ancient Silk Road that formed an artery of trade and cultural exchange between east and west, the Jiayuguan Pass was a solemn and splendid landmark of Great Wall in Gansu. Its construction cost a great deal in terms of manpower and material resources. The work gave rise to a number of strange and sometimes beautiful stories, legends that have come down to us over the centuries.
This is a legend about the Jiayuguan Pass, which tells of a workman named Yi Kaizhan who lived during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and who was a very proficient mathematician. He calculated that it would take exactly 99,999 bricks to build the pass. The supervisor did not believe him and said that if he had miscalculated by so much as just one brick, then all the workmen would be condemned to hard labor for three years as a punishment. After the completion of the project, one brick was left behind the Xiwong city gate. The supervisor was happy at the sight of the brick and prepared to carry out his threat of punishment. However Yi Kaizhan said with an authoritative air that the brick had been put there by a supernatural being to stabilize the wall and that even a tiny move would cause the whole structure to collapse. Therefore the brick remained in place and was never moved. It can still be found there today on the tower of the pass.
Standing Committee Chairman Matthew Daly, a congressional correspondent for the Associated Press, said that journalists in the end will have no choice but to follow the Secret Service's procedures, and isn't sure that public hostilities with the agency will improve the situation.
Hunter's bill would require the heads of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines to independently sign off on whether or not to allow gays to serve openly. The Pentagon has already suggested that such a measure has no place in the world of the military, where strict adherence to chain of command is everything. The law repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell in December already requires the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and President Obama as Commander in Chief to sign off on the process through which the ban on openly gay soldiers will be ended.
The appointment, which does not require Senate confirmation, was welcomed by key members of Congress, including House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah.
And while that depth provides access to obscure sports most viewers may never even encounter on linear TV, from team handball to judo, these feeds are about as dynamic as a surveillance camera, lacking multiple angles and color commentary. Maybe that absence is understandable considering there's only so much manpower available to devote to sports with tiny audiences, but NBCU could actually drive more engagement to these sports by supplementing them with pre-taped videos that explain the rules and tell stories about the players.
The facts are clear. Workers need – and deserve – to make more money. The propriety of a drastic increase in wages is now beyond reasonable debate. And yet, somehow, leaders in Louisville and Kentucky are still debating it. Most of the Democratic members of the Louisville Metro Council support a slow increase in the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, and so does Congressman John Yarmuth, but Metro Council Republicans are “AWOL” and Sen. Mitch McConnell openly opposes any raise at all.
The footage shuts off, and Steve-O then clambers up the 150-foot crane until he hovers high above Hollywood Boulevard. This is when the footage kicks in once more. He looks down and sees dozens of firefighters, seven trucks, and a helicopter circling. "That's a lot of firefighters," Steve-O says into the camera, which is broadcasting directly to Facebook Live. "They don't need that many firefighters. It's just me." The stunt takes longer than expected, and he's shocked by the manpower below. Once perched on top of the vertical portion of the crane, Steve-O makes his way horizontally. He inflates the plastic orca, sets off some illegal firecrackers, and then sends the whale into the wind. As it floats down toward the now-thousands of people gathered below, a message taped to its side is revealed: "SeaWorld Sucks."
"Donald Trump's praise for brutal strongmen seemingly knows no bounds," Sullivan said in a statement Tuesday night. "In reality, Hussein's regime was a sponsor of terrorism — one that paid families of suicide bombers who attacked Israelis, among other crimes.

- The Hurricanes would take a 1-0 lead in the second when Sands allowed a solo home run to second baseman Romy Gonzalez.
- The Seminoles would take a three-run lead in the top of the fifth. Second baseman Matt Henderson hit a sacrifice fly to left field to score right fielder Rhett Aplin.
- Third baseman Dylan Busby then hit his eighth home run on the season. It was a three-run home run to put Florida State up 4-1 in the top of the fifth.
- Sands allowed another run in the bottom of the fifth, as right fielder Michael Burns singled home first baseman Christopher Barr, before getting the hook.
- First baseman Drew Mendoza had a multi-hit game, going 2 for 4 with a double and two strikeouts.
Kerry called passage of the finance bill a victory for Massachusetts. “Our workers and our businesses took it on the chin when Wall Street melted down,'' Kerry said. “These reforms will fix what's most broken, and Chairman Frank, Senator Brown, and I also worked collegially to ensure that Massachusetts' financial firms, which did no harm, will continue to create jobs and engage in legitimate enterprise.''
England are imploding after the latest in a series of alcohol-related incidents but Kevin Pietersen has climbed into the tourists for other failings, accusing Alastair Cook of looking uninterested, batsmen of making out that the Australian attack "is the scariest bowling they've ever faced" and suggesting there may be a factional split in Joe Root's touring party.
Pick analysis: Vaakanainen was the eighth-ranked European skater by the NHL's Central Scouting Service and projected to go around where the B's drafted him. Some public lists had him closer to 11-13 range, while others had him solidly in the second round. The Bruins were looking to add a quality left-shot defenseman and when countryman Juuso Valimaki went off the board to the Calgary Flames at 16, the team went with another of Finland's quality young D who was a member of both of his country's successful two most recent U18 squads (gold, silver in 2016-17) and the very disappointing 2017 U20 World Jr. Team. Vaakanainen is not all that flashy or dynamic a player, but he is mobile, skilled and represents a potential blossoming offensive upside that may not be reflected in his pedestrian stats. He's probably not a high-end prospect, but a solid complementary kind of player who further strengthens the future left side and gives GM Don Sweeney more options to move some of the prospects out in potential packages for NHL-level trades.
The departures create an open competition for the starting QB spot in camp, with Oregon State transfer Luke Del Rio (whom McElwain tried to recruit to Colorado State) having the inside track to the job, trailed by true freshmen Feleipe Franks and Kyle Trask. But regardless of who takes the snaps, the Florida QB should be able to execute in McElwain's system, which features some creative ways of attacking the middle of the field as well as some nice variations of basic staples of today's passing game.
OL Battle: It's probably incredibly difficult to pick up two offensive linemen off waivers and then insert them into your offensive line at the last second. With that said, given how bad our second unit has been, I hope we see a lot of OL Donald Hawkins and OL Karim Barton. Even if they don't impress enough, what's the harm -- just waive them and look over the waiver wire for other teams' "better cuts" when rosters are trimmed to 53 players.

Eddie Feigner, a crowd-pleasing softball pitcher and showman who toured the world for 55 years as The King and His Court, died Feb. 9 from complications of dementia at Cogburn Health and Rehabilitation facility in Huntsville, Ala. He was 81.
Pitching in hundreds of games each year against local all-star teams, Mr. Feigner won 95 percent of the time. He and his "court," which included only a catcher, first baseman and shortstop, played everywhere from Yankee Stadium to the Great Wall of China, with countless military bases, rodeo arenas and cow pastures in between. He appeared in all 50 states and in 98 foreign countries.

World renowned automobile manufacturer Bugatti have teamed up with luxury shisha pipe maker Desvall. The companies envisioned a shisha pipe inspired by state-of-the-art automotive materials and engineering, combined with the iconic Desvall design, craftsmanship and patented technology. The result: Bugatti by Desvall, the ultimate statement for shisha connoisseurs. Stemming from Bugatti's venerable racing heritage and the pioneering performance of the Bugatti Veyron, the Bugatti by Desvall is the quintessential modern shisha pipe. It is an extension of the exclusive Desvall shisha range but replaces the more traditional materials of glass, steel and crystal with high-tech materials from the automotive industry. Handmade in Sweden by premier artisans within their respective fields, the 80 cm tall shisha has a pure titanium frame wrapped in a special edition carbon fiber outer casing with hand sewn leather details. The Bugatti by Desvall retails for $100,000 USD and will be limited to 150 pieces.
New Delhi: In an unusual trend, malaria cases in Delhi touched 177 this year. This is more than the number of cases of the mosquito-borne disease reported in the recent past. In 2016 and 2015, for example, Delhi reported only 90 and 60 malaria cases respectively as on July 8.While dengue and chikungunya viruses are spread by Aedes aegypti mosquito that breeds in fresh water, malaria is spread by the anopheles mosquito that can breed in dirty water. Epidemiologists say high incidence of malaria is reflective of poor sanitation levels.“North corporation has recorded maximum 29 malaria cases, followed by south (15) and east (8). The rest of the cases have been reported from other civic agencies and neighbouring states,” said an official.The incidence of chikungunya, which took to epidemic proportions last year, and dengue is lower compared to malaria this year, the official added.As on July 8, corporations said they have received reports of 161 chikungunya and 109 dengue cases from different hospitals. Doctors said continuous rains may cause further spurt in cases of mosquito-borne diseases in the coming months and there is need for focussed action and awareness initiatives to prevent an outbreak.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), India accounts for 75% of all malaria cases in Southeast Asia . Symptoms of malaria include fever, headache, chills and vomiting, and usually appear 10 to 15 days after the mosquito bite. “If untreated for more than 24 hours, malaria can lead to severe illness, and even result in death. In many parts of the world, the parasites have developed resistance to a number of malaria medicines,” the WHO said.On Wednesday, the Union health ministry launched its plan for elimination of malaria by 2022. Health minister J P Nadda said strategies involve strengthening malaria surveillance, establishing a mechanism for early detection and prevention of outbreaks, promoting the prevention of malaria by use of Long Lasting Impregnated Nets (LLINs), effective indoor residual spray and augmenting manpower and capacities for effective implementation for the next five years.“Inter-sectoral coordination is the key, we have to work together with the other ministries and municipal corporations to achieve the desired results,” the minister said.
It's weird to think that one year ago today Barack Obama was still the president. Michelle Obama was decorating the White House with happy snowmen and gingerbread dogs instead of transforming the East Colonnade into a hell-bound gullet of witch fingers, apparently our new tradition, and the president of the United States somehow made it through the entire week without insulting a single 90-year-old Native American war hero.
Unconfirmed reports claimed that pro-government militiamen known as "shabiha" were going door-to-door and killing indiscriminately.
Almost any person who has been sexually assaulted can describe feeling helpless and alone in the aftermath. But the truth is that she or he rarely is. Abusers often leave a trail of victims in their wake. And when one survivor comes forward, it matters not just for the person but the others who've been holding back their stories. It's a chance for them to say: me too. So whatever you believe or don't believe about the current allegations against adult star James Deen, it's undeniable that Stoya's allegation on November 28 that her former boyfriend and costar raped her was the catalyst for several other women in the industry to start speaking up about their experiences with him.

Even now it is difficult to wrap their heads around - Castile's name is known internationally, for terrible reasons. On 6 July, Castile's girlfriend Diamond Reynolds broadcast his final moments live on Facebook, just seconds after he was shot seven times by a police officer during a traffic stop.
Kennedy becomes the second-oldest player on the Amerks, behind 31-year-old defenseman Tyson Strachan. The Amerks are banking on Kennedy to boost their offense and the prospects' chances of reaching the NHL. Kennedy played 162 games with the Sabres, Panthers, Sharks and Coyotes, so he knows what it takes to reach the big leagues.
While many folks had negative comments about the social media post, Morello (known mostly for his work as the frontman of Rage Against The Machine) had nothing but love.
But Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele launched a rhetorical rebuke.
Pierre LeBrun believes the Canucks prefer to keep Jacob Markstrom over current backup Eddie Lack…LeBrun also claims the Canucks have talks to several teams regarding struggling winger Zack Kassian. Though they've found no suitors, interest could pick up at the trade deadline….Darren Dreger believes the Canucks seek scoring and until recently had some discussions with Boston regarding defenseman Matt Bartkowski. The Canucks won't part with their young assets.He speculates the Flames might move Curtis Glencross, perhaps for a defenseman. The Jets still seek a top-9 forward…Dreger also speculates there could be interested in Canucks forward Chris Higgins, though he's not sure they're ready to part with him.

Sen. Steve Daines is proposing an amendment to the Republican healthcare bill that would implement a government-run, single-payer insurance system in the U.S. The Montana Republican doesn't support single-payer healthcare. But in a bit of political gamesmanship often seen in Congress, Daines wants to force vulnerable Democratic senators running for re-election in red states in 2018 to take a position on the liberal healthcare policy, which is gaining currency on the Left...Daines' single-payer amendment is a carbon copy of one offered in the House by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. The Conyers bill, with more than 100 Democratic cosponsors, proposes to create a program the legislation describes as "Medicare for All." According to the bill's language, "all individuals residing in the United States would be covered."

But today there is news of footprints near the village of Eryomino, close to the Chyoka River, in the Kyshtovsky district, Novosibirsk region, regarded as a little off the beaten track for the abominable snowman aka Bigfoot and Sasquatch.
The commotion led another fisherman Alexander Goloburdo, from Kyshtovka village, to cross the river to examine the evidence. He brought his friend Vladimir Sychyov.
On September 20, How to Get Away with Murder's Viola Davis became the first woman of color in herstory to win an Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a Drama. “Let me tell you something: The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity,” she said in her impassioned acceptance speech. “You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.” Veteran comedian Whoopi Goldberg didn't quite understand what Davis was getting at.
Before we see Huo as a child, a scene of him is shown seeking passage on a boat, with the boatman taking a small jade jewel out of a sack as payment from Huo (shown later to be the gift that Huo's daughter intended to give him when he wins his fight). This will also later be shown to be a scene of Huo wandering in despair.
Goldberg also interviews the former journeyman enforcer Brantt Myhres, who claims fighting led him to abuse alcohol and drugs (he received a lifetime suspension from the N.H.L.), and Cam Stewart, a former agitating forward who coached Boogaard in the minors and spoke with him frequently before his death. Dr. Robert Cantu, a Boston neurosurgeon, says N.H.L. enforcers have told him they suffer concussions “every fourth or fifth fight” but never tell doctors of their symptoms for fear of losing their jobs.

Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, reportedly ordered the crackdown, a claim that his administration denies.
Robles said the family ran out of money after her boyfriend lost his job and a paperwork issue stopped the federal assistance they had been receiving.
This will be the first go-around at the Upfronts for the November hire of former Fox Chairman Kevin Reilly as President of TNT and TBS and Chief Creative Officer of Turner Entertainment — roles intended to take the place of departed Turner Entertainment Networks president Steve Koonin, who exited just before the Upfronts last year, and former TNT and TBS Programming president Michael Wright, who left in August.

The committee gave Lowe the go-ahead to build the computer. IBM, recognizing itself that its bureaucracy was an impediment to anyone really, you know, getting anything done, had recently come up with a concept it called the Independent Business Unit. The idea was that an IBU would work as a semi-independent entity, freed from the normal bureaucracy, with IBM acting essentially as the venture capitalists. Fortune magazine called the IBU, “How to start your own company without leaving IBM.” Chairman Cary, in a quote that has often been garbled and misattributed, called the IBU IBM's answer to the question, “How do you make an elephant [IBM] tap dance?” Lowe's IBU would be code-named Project Chess, and the machine they would create would be code-named the Acorn. (Apparently no one was aware of the British computer company of the same name.) They were given essentially free rein, with one stipulation: the Acorn must be ready to go in just one year.
It's a little bit of a head scratcher why Leopold's went back to the drawing board for this gin. Their Small Batch Gin is so exceptional with such finesse that we would have preferred they bring that mix into the higher proof world of Navy Strength. There's no doubt that the craftsmanship of this gin is solid, but we feel that Todd Leopold went a little too far with this gin. It's a classic example of “if it ain't broke, don't fix it” and while we respect the effort, we feel this gin is only going to appeal to a very specific audience looking for extremely strong floral and spice notes in their gin glass.
*** The offensive line continues to struggle to block the run without marked improvement from week to week. This is a concerning trend. Last year the line improved as the run plays were switched to utilize the athleticism of lineman versus their negative power quotient. That same athleticism isn't present with this years group and consistent block fits and the ability to hold the blocks are sporadic.
TCU lines up with an unbalanced line and a wildcat. ISU counters with four down lineman and nine in the box.
Sophomores Ja'Vonn ‘Pigg' Harrison and Ermon Lane, and freshmen George Campbell, Da'Vante Phillips and Auden Tate were all ranked as four-star receivers or higher coming out of high school, with Lane and Campbell ranked as five-star prospects.
If we look at defensemen specifically, we can use this old CanucksArmy post as a guideline, which used the now-defunct War-on-Ice version of Goals Above Replacement (GAR) - conceptually, this is the same thing as the WAR stat I mentioned above. The only difference in the concept is in the units - goals versus wins. They found something similar - while defencemen do peak early, they're not falling off the face of the earth as soon as they turn 28. Age 32 seems to be the season where things really start to go bad, at least based on the chart below:
Is he cut out for that role? No, probably not. But he's fulfilled it relatively well, horrific on-ice save percentage aside. Against this competition, his score and venue adjusted CF% is 50.28%. Include zone adjustments, and it moves up to 51.2%, which is right in line with the team average (per Corsica.hockey). And an obvious reminder - there is more to a player than CorsiRel. Zaitsev has also quarterbacked one of the league's best power play units, played significant minutes shorthanded, and has the hidden value of not taking many penalties, especially for a defenseman. More obviously, he records 0.5 primary points per 60 minutes at 5v5, which is on the border of top-pairing play for individual offense. To that end, Dawson Sprigings' GAR stat (used in the first aging curve linked in this piece), has Zaitsev ranked 41st among defensemen this season*. This is largely driven by the skills mentioned above - in particular his ability to not take penalties, and his even strength offense.
So maybe Toronto pokes at the trade market? Well, all we've heard since last July is how teams refuse to trade defencemen for less than a king's ransom now. Maybe they can swing a deal for one of Anaheim's guys, or Jacob Trouba, or whoever. More likely, they can't, not without giving up significant resources, and likely a similar cap hit for that player.
To the surprise of many industry observers, All Is By My Side is currently in pre-production, the Irish Film and Television Network reports. André 3000 will spend six weeks at locations in Bray, Dun Laoghaire and Dublin, including the historic John Player Cigarette Factory. The film is to be directed by Three Kings writer John Ridley, who also wrote the screenplay, and deals with Hendrix's breakthrough in 1966, when he was discovered in a New York club by Linda Keith, then girlfriend of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards.
I have to tell you that when I was in Vietnam, I was no hero, and I did not witness a single act of heroism during the year I spent there, first as a U.S. Army private and then as a sergeant. Yes, there was heroism in the Vietnam War. On both sides of the conflict there were notable acts of self-sacrifice and bravery. Troops in my unit wondered how the North Vietnamese troops could persevere for years in the face of daunting US firepower. US medical corpsmen performed incredible acts of valor rescuing the wounded under fire.
Years later, Alvarez borrowed $11,000 for rent for the Candy Store from the “mafia club” that resided at a restaurant a few doors down. Every Sunday, Alvarez recalled, a hitman from said club would visit the store to collect $550 in interest. Alvarez always paid up — until he couldn't anymore. In this pickle, Alvarez called a friend who dropped off $11,000 to his door the next day. As Alvarez tells it, there was no shortage of good people gifting him the exact cash amount he needed 24 hours after making a phone call. In 2010, after a bout of financial trouble, regulars and neighbors of Ray's helped him raise $3,500 to pay rent and buy a host of new equipment.
Last month, following a long period of girlish cajoling, my daughter finally got her ears pierced in celebration of her 7th birthday. The setting was not the traditional mall kiosk staffed by some bored and minimally trained 16-year-old. Instead I took my daughter to a tattoo parlor.
LaRoe is so convinced of the superiority of needles over piercing guns that she's signed petitions to ban the guns; one such petition makes the case that “only cowboys use guns.” In her quest to reform the ear-piercing industry, LaRoe leaves her business card at schools and pediatricians' offices. When she takes her own son to the doctor, she'll frequently get questions about her multiple piercings; sometimes she gets customers that way too.
At first, she reveled in her sexual discovery. In 2008, she gave a talk at TED university titled “The Toyboy Manifesto: Why Older Woman Plus Younger Man Is the Relationship Model of the Future,” in which she argued that such pairings, while generally deemed socially unacceptable, were not only sexually ideal but also righted gender imbalances. Young men, she said, found her life experience appealing rather than threatening.
The showman is in power, and do the freedom fighters need a symbol more repulsive than a priapic presidency?
Play Marc Staal with Brady Skjei. Had I told off-season Greg this idea, he would think something tragic happened to me and I'm not capable of having a coherent thought. However, Staal has been one of the four-best Ranger defensemen this year, but he still moves like a man stuck in mud at times on the ice. Pairing him with a speedy partner could, in theory, cover some areas of his game that are lacking. In a situation where the Rangers have their backs against the wall, you take risks. A Staal/Skjei pairing could be disastrous, but you need to keep your four-best defenders on the ice as much as you can in order to get back into a game. If Shatty moves up to play with Mac, you have to try Skjei with Staal. That is simple.
Daughter of Sewol Crewman Commits Suicide
My first visit to the region as a civilian desiring to study Arabic in 2004, after completion of active duty military service, began a process of undoing every assumption I'd ever imbibed concerning Middle East culture, politics, and conflict. An initial visit to Syria from Lebanon was the start of something that my Marine buddies could hardly conceive of: Damascus became my second home through frequent travel and lengthy stays from 2004 to 2010, and was my place of true education on the real life and people of the region. While my fellow servicemen were just across Syria's border settling in to the impossible task of occupying a country they had no understanding of, I was able view a semblance of Iraq as it once was through the prism of highly stable Ba'athist Syria.
I'm a big sucker for anything by Dieter VDO. He's a treasure. Angie Wang is such a great artist and her color work is an inspiration. Same goes for Dash Shaw; New School took it a level further. Giannis Milonogiannis can do no wrong, except have a tumblr that drives me nuts with envy. I'm the first to champion a writer/artist, so I really, really tried to get into Aaron Kuder's Superman issue. Liked the cover, liked the art. Lala Albert draws the best profiles. Chris Mooneyham draws the best under-nose shadows. Brett Lewis and Cliff Chang did a short story in that Witching Hour anthology. Chang's scratchy side is a nice welcome and Lewis... well, Lewis is one of comic's best writers. Was he blacklisted or something? That guy can write anything and I'd be on board. Give that man an Avatar book.

Johnson, a political showman whose buffoonish and eccentric exterior masks fierce ambition to succeed Cameron, dismissed questions about whether the announcement was a bid for the future leadership of the Conservative Party.
Traditionally regarded as the first Western philosopher and mathematician, Thales of Miletus (a Greek colony on the west coast of present day Turkey) lived c. 585 BCE. He accurately predicted the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BCE and was known as a skilled astronomer, geometer, statesman and sage. Thales, it is said, was the first to ask the question, “What is the basic 'stuff' of the universe” and, according to Aristotle, claimed the First Cause was water because, among other attributes, water could change shape and move while still remaining unchanging in substance. There are no known writings by Thales and all that is known of his life and work is through what we have written about him by others.
"We need to defend our local currency by lowering our fiscal deficit and inflation, not by withdrawing bills from circulation," Congressman Jose Guerra said during National Assembly session earlier this week.
“Instead of stirring up strife and grossly mischaracterizing the conversation that took place between Mr. Morris and Chairman Haynes, let's set the record straight. There was never an agreement, especially after the Trump campaign spoke dismissively about the Party process and one of our female members,” Leatherwood said in a statement.
Throughout my adult life, I've regularly had bottles of bubbly or wine sent to my restaurant table by men I don't know. Once, a well-dressed chap bought my train ticket when I was standing behind him in the queue, while there was another occasion when a charming gentleman paid my fare as I stepped out of a cab in Paris.
And most poignantly of all, not one girlfriend has ever asked me to be her bridesmaid.
Blushing bride: Samantha on her wedding day, left, and right, at home with Pascal. She laments that not one of her girlfriends has ever asked her to be a bridesmaid - perhaps from fear of being overshadowed by her looks
Plus, the ecosytem for fixing has never been better. YouTube has plenty of how-to-fix-it videos; sites like iFixit sell parts and post repair guides for tech new and old. Better yet, the advent of cheap 3-D printers makes new types of repairs possible. In Chicago, Ally Brisbin runs a repair night at her café and says, "My boyfriend brings in his MakerBot, so if you need a part he can print it."
There are variations on this, of course. There's “look, I tried it but found my daughter to be magically hardwired to like glitter unicorns and my son to like machine guns, so there's nothing I can do about it”. Then there's “I'm raising my son in a man-cave because I read something about testosterone, spatial rotation and monkeys – or was it rats? - written in 1997 and you can't argue with science”. There's also “none shall ever know the sex of my child and I'll change their nappies with my eyes closed, avoiding unconscious bias even if it means spreading poo everywhere”.
Once it's made official, the Rays will have to make room for Norris on their 40-man roster. He will become the fourth player expected to make the Rays opening day roster who will need to be added. The others include reliever Tommy Hunter, catcher Jesus Sucre, and first baseman Rickie Weeks.
Your 2012 record: +1. This is a website that torments you with the possibility that today might just be the day you get to see a Snapchat photo of an athlete's flaccid penis, news of a massive hoax involving a dead (?) girlfriend (??), or an in-depth takedown of the corruption endemic to the NCAA, but deep in your heart you know that 99 percent of the time it's just gonna be pictures of someone reading a book at a Royals game, or maybe a poorly animated GIF of some highlight you already saw a billion times last night on ESPN. But hey, at least they raised a couple hundred grand for their new office/crack videos, right? We all saw how that one worked out. Beaten by Canadians. DON'T WORRY, THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR GUYS.
Green was suspended this morning for three games without pay for his elbow to the head of Michael Frolik on Friday night. The NHL's leading scorer among defenseman will forfeit $81,606.21.
Green referred all questions about the league's decision to Coach Bruce Boudreau. But the defenseman said he didn't think he deserved a penalty.
The letter has been signed by 29 Congressmen and urges Seehofer to facilitate a dialogue between the Jewish families who suspect their ancestors had art stolen from them under Nazi rule and the Bavarian state museums, reports Spiegel.

If the Pig in a Puppy is Kings' greatest contribution to barbecue culture in North Carolina, the Carolina Oink Express is Kings' greatest contribution to 'cue culture in the country. You see, King's has a mail-order service that will get you your chopped pork, hush puppies (pre-fried and frozen), black-eyed peas, Brunswick stew, collard greens, coleslaw, and pork ribs delivered to you within 48 hours, anywhere in the U.S. of A. North Carolina-born servicemen and women (as well as people out of the service whom we've enlightened) have the Oink Express sending 50 to 60 care packages a week to the deserts and metropolitan areas of our great nation. Kings is on the Army and Air Force Exchange, so you can get your barbecue on base, too.
Leigh Ann Sepelyak allegedly set her boyfriend on fire, and then doused him with urine to put out the blaze.

Thanks to the movie Jaws, the great white's reputation as a ruthless man-eater pervades to this day. So you can't be blamed for being slightly concerned if you took a quiz claiming to match your personality with a shark's, put together by the Discovery Channel, and found out that you are a great white. Sure, you may indeed be “curious yet cautious” and “aggressive but also recessive;” people may be “dangerously intrigued” by you. But does your personality really match that of such a loathed creature? Can an entire species of sharks be generalized in that way?
Churchill's patina of statesmanship is at long last coming off. The fact is he possessed an extraordinary range of prejudices. According to Hastings, in a memorandum to the war cabinet in November 1942 about policy towards Italy, he wrote: “All the industrial centres should be attacked in intense fashion, every effort being made to terrorise the population.”
That's one of my favorite parts about Paige. And that's why at first when they were bringing Matthew Beeman [Daniel Flaherty] back I was kind of angry. I'm so proud of the fact that I was one of the only teenage girls on TV who didn't have a boyfriend and her main problem wasn't the fact that the boy didn't like her back or something silly like that. She actually had real problems at home and she's smart and strong; I was über proud of that.
With CBS cameras rolling, and new girlfriend Lindsey Vonn somewhere in the room celebrating on Twitter, Woods went back and forth with Masters chairman Billy Payne about his two-stroke victory over Adam Scott and Angel Cabrera (which wasn't really that close) and how it felt to end his winless streak in majors dating back to the 2008 U.S. Open. Arguably, though, Woods' most arresting comment came after Jim Nantz asked if there was a moment in the tournament the golfer felt was the turning point.
In September 2011, Nick Ebert was a consensus top-5 draft pick. He was rated more highly than other top young defencemen Morgan Rielly, Griffin Reinhart, Mathew Dumba, Jacob Trouba, Derrick Pouliot, and- well, basically everybody else not named Ryan Murray.
The last pick of the last round is usually a throwaway (although there are currently two active NHL players who were both Mr. Irrelevant in their draft years), and expectations for Ebert have to be focused through that lens. After reading a variety of opinions from people who would know better than I do, I get the sense that the consensus is that Ebert still has the fundamental skill and instincts to make it as an NHL regular, but he remains quite a project. That, of course, isn't much of a problem for the Kings, who have a million nine defencemen in LA, and a million quite a few prospect defencemen at every development level. Ebert will probably never be an offensive dynamo, and he'll also probably never be a defensive rock who can shut down any opposition, but getting a serviceable two-way defenceman for pick #211 would be quite a coup for Lombardi, Futa & co.
At Guantánamo, the prison has nearly 140 Navy medical workers — doctors, nurses, corpsmen — assigned exclusively to care for the captives. The staff includes 37 reinforcements sent by the U.S. Southern Command in April.
Rubin's been tweeting up an anti-Erdogan storm, and in Turkish, too. The famously thin-skinned strongman won't have it: He's had his (recently purged) courts order the social-media firm to shut down Rubin's feed, or else.
The strongman has already restricted Twitter in the past — when tweets about his corruption were trending in 2014, for example. That actually prompted Erdoğan to talk of an across-the-board shutdown of social media.
Rookie defenceman Ben Harpur skated with captain Erik Karlsson while veteran Dion Phaneuf was with Thomas Chabot in the second pairing. The third trio was made up of Johnny Oduya with Fredrik Claesson which left Cody Ceci as the fill-in man during many of the drills.
“We'll have to see what's happening with Stone. We'll have to see if we have to call up someone. We could be going with seven defencemen but we could also be going with six,” Boucher said. “It's a bit about Stone right now.”
GABE LELAND is the strongest candidate in the District 7 race, and voters should elect him to a second term in office. But Leland will enter his second term with an incredibly high bar to meet. Earlier this summer, Fox 2 Detroit reported that Leland had cast yes-votes on contracts the Detroit City Council awarded to the family of his girlfriend at the time, Jennifer Fiore, daughter of towing magnate Gaspar Fiore and an executive in the company's firms. While there is no suggestion that the Fiores influenced Leland's vote, it's a clear ethical lapse and one Leland must not repeat. Since then, Fiore was indicted by the federal government for allegedly bribing officials in connection with garbage contracts in Macomb County; the City of Detroit has also accused Fiore of tax malfeasance. To participate in decision-making around such contracts is both an abdication of the proper priorities of a council member, and opens Detroit to criticism from outsiders eager to paint the city in a negative light. Leland must do better.
But the town recently approved the creation of a separate Board of Health from selectmen and hiring of a town administrator, and Town Hall is already cramped, she said.
The Aug. 8 letter was a follow-up to a meeting between selectmen and members of the Council on Aug. 3 at which town officials notified the Council of the decision to use the Grange Hall for town office space, Goulart said.
She said an addition to Town Hall would be costly and selectmen would like to keep all offices in close proximity to each other for the convenience of residents in need of town services. Grange Hall is the only viable option, she said.
Lon Horiuchi - FBI sniper at Ruby Ridge. Aug. 22 1992, Horiuchi fired a shot at a man ducking into the cabin. The shot killed Vicki Weaver as she stood inside the cabin behind the door, holding her infant daughter, Elisheba. The killing occurred on the second day of an 11 day standoff that began with a shoot out that killed the Weavers son Samuel, 14 and U.S. Deputy Marshal Willam Degan. The federal government, though, is leaping to Horiuchi's defense, because he was obeying an order. But the Nuremberg and My Lai prosecutions have established that "I vas just following orders" is no excuse for killing innocent people. The license-to-kill orders were so outrageous that other FBI snipers at the scene -- for example, the SWAT team from Denver -- agreed among themselves that the license-to-kill order should not be obeyed. The Denver agents chose to disobey the unconstitutional order, and instead to stick with the traditional rules of engagement. Besides choosing to obey an illegal assassination order, Horiuchi lied under oath at Randy Weaver's trial. Horiuchi claimed that he opened fire on Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris because the two men were threatening to shoot an FBI helicopter. But the trial judge found this testimony so blatantly false that he ordered the charges related to the testimony to be dismissed. (The helicopter was nowhere near where Weaver or Harris could have shot at it.) [The Ruby Ridge Prosecutions] Yesterday, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that FBI agent Charles Riley said all the way back in June 1993 that he heard shots fired from a sniper post occupied by agent Lon Horiuchi - The FBI's favorite hitman The head of one of the Midwest's largest taxpayer groups today named F.B.I. sniper Lon Horiuchi "Tax Villain of the Month" for crimes against U.S. citizens committed while collecting a salary paid by U.S. taxpayers. - Taxpayers Name F.B.I.

This ruling has the same effect as granting a license to kill with impunity to any government agency. In 1992 an FBI employee hired a killer by the name of Lon Horiuchi, who shot Vicki Weaver in the head with his 308 caliber high-powered telescoped equipped sniper rifle from 200 yards, while she held her nursing baby in her arms, killing her instantly.
Anchor Christopher Cuomo pointed out that Palin's own personal history went against her abstinence-only message for teens. (Palin, 18, recently had a baby with former boyfriend Levi Johnston.) She became pregnant after she and Levi failed to use protection (something Johnston admitted on the "Tyra" show.)
National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers said Thursday that "the circumstances surrounding this situation are extremely disappointing to me" but that the 18th Congressional District would remain in Republican hands.
Mr Freedman helped deliver Ten riches in the 1990s by focusing the network almost exclusively on targeting the 16 to 39 year old age group. But he sold out of the company in 2004 after he bought his third phone in a year and found that it had internet connectivity. "That was a very big warning bell for me that the medium was changing, there was newer technology and therefore I was very cautious. "If the audience migrated were going to have a huge problem because who were we going to advertise to. We had the biggest budget of people like Levis, Just Jeans, Coke, Pepsi and all those sorts of things and very little of David Jones because of our audience." People called Mr Freedman mad for selling his stock but his fears were eventually realised.
There was, however, a notable difference in the way that Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton handled the strongman — one that reveals a substantive and important divide on foreign policy. Mr. Trump's post-meeting statement heaped uncritical praise on Mr. Sissi, thanking him “and the Egyptian people for what they have done in defense of their country” and promising to invite the coup-maker for an official visit to Washington.
On Wednesday, the Clinton campaign launched "Together for America," a group of Republican politicians, strategists and academics who have come out for Clinton. The list includes former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, former Congressman Chris Shays and former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte.
(CNN) -- On the same day singer Chris Brown was arraigned for allegedly beating his pop star girlfriend Rihanna, he made an appeal to fans on his Myspace page: Vote for me for the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards. That's right. No apology, no concern for his battered girlfriend. He's worried about the next awards show.
Earlier today, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis) released his Fiscal Year 2014 House Budget Resolution, The Path to Prosperity: A Responsible, Balanced Budget. Like Ryan's fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 budget resolutions, this latest iteration is an austerity budget—it proposes aggressive near- and long-term spending cuts, which come on top of the austerity from sequestration spending cuts (which would be continued), the ratcheting down of discretionary spending caps, and the recent expiration of the payroll tax cut.
It is unfortunate that Chairman Ryan has again failed to heed mounting evidence counseling against near-term budget austerity. Instead, his fiscal 2014 budget—like the two preceding it—has proposed deep and premature austerity that would unequivocally delay return to full employment and cost millions of American jobs relative to current budget policy.
Then he posted up this photo to Instagram of himself rocking a cowboy hat, Metro keeping it real with his signature bandana, and Missy keeping it fresh as always.
We are products of the Paleolithic age, a period of many thousands of years in which the Homo species developed the unique adaptations that make them human. In the Paleolithic period we lived in small tribes. The information we had was limited. But it was reliable. When a fellow tribesman came running into camp with word that another tribe was about to attack, we had a pretty good idea of how real and how important that information was. We grabbed our spears.
The New York Times reported recently that President Trump over the summer pressured Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and other Republicans to bring a swift end to their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Notably, Burr confirmed -- on the record -- that Trump told him he hoped the investigation would conclude soon.

Death Cab For Cutie aren't exactly known as a fiery band, but that doesn't mean frontman Ben Gibbard is immune to being ticked off. On Wednesday evening during the band's show at Charleston, South Carolina's Volvo Car Stadium, that became clear when Gibbard lost his cool and stormed off stage.
As infielders gathered near the pitcher's mound when reliever Jeremy Affeldt was summoned from the bullpen, shortstop Brandon Crawford snatched the glove of first baseman Brandon Belt and hid it behind his back.
The Cardinals had runners on first and second with one out when Kolten Wong hit a sharp grounder that seemed ticketed for left field. Third baseman Pablo Sandoval got a piece of it with his glove, and the ball deflected toward Crawford. The shortstop gloved it heading to his right, turned on a dime and unloaded a perfect throw to second to force Randal Grichuk for the second out.
Second baseman Joe Panik was surprised that Crawford managed to get even one out on Wong's grounder.
Donald Trump has yet to adopt the demeanor of a statesman this election season - despite his fulsome comments toward Texas Sen Ted Cruz after he suspended his campaign that may have suggested a tonal shift.
That demand brought Filament smack up against the biggest problem in providing visual erotica for straight women: the pervasive nervousness about depictions of aroused men. Previous attempts to offer erotic imagery to women flopped when publications such as For Women and Playgirl offered only photography that many believed fell short of what women wanted from an adult mag.

Huntsman is an experienced politician and diplomat, having previously served as the ambassador to Singapore, and later to China during the Obama administration. He also ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.
Huntsman did not face many tough questions during his hearing Tuesday—at one point, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Huntsman discussed the nominee's daughter's piano career—and several senators praised his record of public service. He's expected to sail through the confirmation process and earned the praise of many on the committee, including some Democrats. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) called Huntsman “a tremendous patriot” and encouraged his colleagues”to vote unanimously for this outstanding gentleman.”

As anyone who has spent any time with the man will tell you, Noel Gallagher is superb, dangerous company, not least because the High Flying Birds frontman has an opinion on absolutely everything, which this afternoon ranges from writing his autobiography - "Yes, I'll do one. No, I won't do a Wayne Rooney and write six" - to the absurdities of what he calls "Heston Blumenthal's barbed-wire-flavoured ice cream". We spend the afternoon talking, drinking champagne and - for me at least - laughing so much my face turns to clay.
Selectmen Chairman Ron Aponte took the action in light of the problematic nature of the accusations against Fox. In an interview, Aponte said that Fox neither told the board nor the town administrator about the matter at the time it happened more than seven months ago.
Selectmen first became aware of the matter -- not from Fox -- but via news reports on Wednesday, Aponte said. The decision to suspend Fox, with pay, was made the following day.
Selectmen are expected to discuss the issue at their next scheduled meeting on Monday.
On Thursday, the day that Mr. Sarles was delivering his self-congratulatory remarks to the Metro board, passengers on five of the system's six rail lines were facing major delays. On that very day, while Metro Board Chairman Tom Downs was praising Mr. Sarles for “rebuilding the [system's] safety culture from top to bottom,” Metro was four days away from its worst passenger train disaster since 2009, when a Red Line crash killed eight passengers and a train operator.
Gudas provided some much-needed energy early on against Florida, taking four shots and scoring a power play goal (his first of the year) before being ejected midway through the second period. The 23-year-old defenseman also helped keep things fresh, with the Bolts pushing through the second night of the season's first back-to-back.
Losing Gudas against the Panthers left the Bolts with five defensemen to cycle through the rest of the game, and they wore down by the end of it, allowing two third-period goals before escaping with the shootout victory.
Defenseman Matt Carle was a workhorse for the Lightning on Sunday, leading the team with 29:24 of ice time.

GRAPEVINE -- Two Dallas Cowboys starting offensive linemen said Wednesday from the club's annual sponsors golf tournament that they're excited about the recent addition of first-round pick Ezekiel Elliott.
"We need all the help we can get, and he's a great addition to our team," Cowboys Pro Bowl left tackle Tyron Smith said while taking a quick break between holes.
Vancouver, B.C. – The Vancouver Canucks announced today the selection of Thomas Gradin for induction into the club's Ring of Honour. The Vancouver Canucks will celebrate Gradin's Ring of Honour Night, presented by Save-On-Foods, Monday, January 24th during a pre-game ceremony at Rogers Arena prior to Vancouver's game versus Dallas. The former Canucks centreman becomes the third Ring of Honour inductee after original franchise captain, Orland Kurtenbach and former Canucks goaltender Kirk McLean were unveiled earlier this season.
One of Vancouver's first European-born players, Gradin played eight of his nine NHL seasons in a Vancouver Canucks uniform from 1978.79 to 1985.86. He finished second in scoring in his rookie season, recording 51 points (20-31-51) in 76 regular season games played. During his rookie postseason, he led all Canucks skaters in scoring with five points (4-1-5) in three playoff games played. He left Vancouver as the highest scoring centreman in franchise history with 550 points (197-353-550) in 613 regular season games and 38 points (17-21-38) in 38 playoff games played for the Canucks.
The locker stall inside the Washington Capitals' practice facility remained untouched for six months while its occupant healed, but now defenseman John Erskine had returned, which by itself was cause for celebration. His body felt strong. His surgically repaired neck hadn't locked up, at least not today. He sat down, grabbed his biceps and smiled to provide proof.

Ryan's comments followed a call on Wednesday by the Senate's No 2 Republican, John Cornyn, for an examination of bump stocks. “I own a lot of guns and as a hunter and sportsman I think that's our right as Americans, but I don't understand the use of this bump stock, and that's another reason to have a hearing,” he said.
Senator Dianne Feinstein has also called for bump stocks to be banned. Congressman David Cicilline has also proposed a ban with a bill in the House that he said has 148 co-sponsors.

Ogletree is the ninth member of Georgia's 19-man 2010 signing class -- joining tailback Ken Malcome, defensive end Dexter Morant, safety Jakar Hamilton, cornerback Derek Owens, linebacker Demetre Baker, offensive lineman Brent Benedict, defensive end Jalen Fields and receiver Lonnie Outlaw -- to either leave the program for reasons other than entering the draft, or never qualify for enrollment. Meanwhile, offensive lineman Kolton Houston has still yet to play in a game and linebacker Brandon Burrows made a limited college debut just last fall.

In his bestselling book, “Abundance”, my colleague, XPRIZE Chairman and CEO and Singularity University founder Peter Diamandis, tells the story of how aluminum went from a rare metal to something we casually wrap our food in. When the king of Siam hosted Napoleon III in the 1840s, writes Diamandis, the people working for Napoleon were served with silver utensils. Those working for the king received gold. The king himself got aluminum-the the rarest metal at the time. Aluminum was so valuable because it was extremely difficult to extract from bauxite-though it is one of the most abundant elements on Earth. Then came electrolysis technology, which used electricity to liberate aluminum from bauxite, driving down aluminum's value.

Today's unveiling of the House Republican budget resolution sees House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) rehashing the same failed budget priorities that were met with widespread criticism last year.

In 1882, almost a century after Poland was partitioned and lost its independence, Polish nobleman and officer of Russian Imperial Fleet, Stefan Szolc-Rogoziński organized an expedition to Cameroon.[3][4] Officially that was an exploration expedition, but unofficially the expedition was looking for a place a Polish colony could be founded.[5] He had no official support from the Russian Empire, nor from its puppet Congress Poland, but was backed by a number of influential Poles, including Boleslaw Prus, and Henryk Sienkiewicz. On 13 December 1882, accompanied by Leopold Janikowski and Klemens Tomczek, Rogoziński left French port of Le Havre, aboard a ship Lucja Malgorzata, with French and Polish flags. The expedition was a failure, and he returned to Europe, trying to collect more money for his project. Finally, after second expedition, Rogoziński found himself in Paris, where he died 1 December 1896.

The numbers really were impressive. His 34-inch vertical leap tied receiver Robert Ruiz for No. 1 among CSU's pro prospects and was 2 inches higher than the best mark among the 47 offensive lineman at the NFL Scouting Combine. And his 23 repetitions at 225 pounds in the bench press was five more than any other CSU player managed that day and equal to or better than 28 offensive linemen at the combine.
(6) A new book on the political and cultural significance of "the digital age" has just been released, and notably, it is jointly authored by Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and former State Department official Jared Cohen. Something is apparently very broken in the matrix because the New York Times today has a review of the book, and it is written by . . . Julian Assange. He begins by noting (accurately) that their co-authorship "reflects the ever closer union between the State Department and Silicon Valley", and documents the banal pieties and mandated orthodoxies pervading the book:
In the United States, an openly gay athlete, at least in the more popular sports, is even harder to find. The nearest that American Football has come is the addition of legal protection for openly gay players to the collective bargaining agreement. Whether the measure is sufficient to encourage any players to actually come out remains to be seen, but nobody will be holding their breath. In U.S. sports, the boundary of heteronormativity has a double guard. Beyond the first line of homophobia and social custom is the “morality clause” in major endorsement deals – contracts that most players crave, and only the most gifted attain. To receive the multimillion-dollar reward of representing a brand, players must live a life of which the average customer would supposedly approve. Homosexuality doesn't sell, meaning that silence is golden: if a player wants to take full economic advantage of his profession, he must pass for straight. It might initially seem that a few brave sportsmen or a corporation willing to temporarily forego maximum profits is the only thing required to break the mold. But we know from the case of Gareth Thomas that one role model alone cannot reform a sport, let alone a society.
This weekend, Nevada Democratic Chairwoman Roberta Lange declined to make a rule change that would have benefitted Bernie Sanders. It's a decision she won't soon forget—since then, she's been flooded with death threats and personalized insults.
As the raid this past weekend illustrated, cracking down on illegal establishments can be labor intensive.

“This is not the first time Nigerians based abroad are being dealt with this way. It was so sympathetic that students left their homes to where they are studying, if there is any conflict involving the two countries, it would have been understandable, but the issue of taking them right from the airport to detention and collecting their passports, I think this is the height of insult to the sovereignty of a nation”, the Committee Chairman said.

If Paulsen and the other Congressmen get their way, it would undoubtedly sound the death knell for the generic medicine trade in general. Which wouldn't only affect those in India and the rest of the developing world, but countless others around the globe; as Dr Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organisation, said earlier this year: "The costs of many new medical products are becoming unsustainable for even the wealthiest countries in the world. [Of the 12 cancer drugs approved last year], 11 were priced above the $100,000 per patient per year. This price is unaffordable, for most patients, most health budgets and most insurance companies. These are problems for all countries, not just the developing world."
Slaine refused to come downstairs and see the woman who cared for her, her daughter, her dog, her duplex apartment and her Hamptons home for the last 15 years. Instead, her boyfriend came down and tried in vain to convince the police officers, guarding the front of the building, to disperse the crowd. The protesters, fully within their rights, stayed for nearly two hours, chanting, giving speeches, flyering to Slaine's neighbors, and playing their instruments.

Exclusive: Man awarded $20,000 after judge finds flaws in police investigation of "bizarre" sexual allegations by girlfriend
A man accused of forcing his girlfriend to get breast implants has been awarded $20,000 by a judge who criticised the police investigation into her "bizarre" allegations.
In their opposition to bail, the police told the judge there was an audio recording of the boyfriend making an admission of guilt and a statement from an "eye witness" to the assault which caused the injury.
This is a true story about a woman named Deborah Kroll from Pasadena, Maryland. Deborah's troubles began around the time her ex-husband passed away from cancer in 2007. She was still on good terms with her ex and even his girlfriend, Rosalie Bell, at the time of his death. Deborah attended his funeral, sat next to her ex's girlfriend and consoled her through heavy tears. Every week afterwards she would call Rosalie (also known as Rosie) to check on her.
Ference may have the body of a 26-year-old with his fitness regimen, but he'll be the Oilers' oldest player at age 36 and probably a third-pairing defenceman this season. He needs to play only 99 more games to reach the 1,000-game milestone in the NHL.
The constant shuffling of the offensive linemen made it hard to gauge how much protection and how much time Brady had in the pocket. This lead to teams exploiting those weaknesses and forcing Brady to make quick decisions and sacks behind the line of scrimmage.
Mackanin projected that Crawford would play "five or six" games at shortstop. That means Freddy Galvis may not play in all of the team's 162 games, as is his goal. Galvis, the Phils' starting shortstop since the start of 2015, has played Gold Glove-caliber defense this season, but he entered Tuesday night with an on-base percentage of just .304. Phillies general manager Matt Klentak is committed to building his team around players with strong on-base skills. Crawford has them. His career on-base percentage in the minors is .367. All of these points to Galvis or third baseman Maikel Franco being shopped for a wintertime trade that would open a spot for Crawford. Franco, who carries a .278 on-base percentage, was bounced from the lineup in favor of Crawford on Tuesday night. Regardless of where Crawford plays next season, he still profiles as the team's shortstop of the future. Galvis will be a free agent after next season.
Some of the most promising performance developments are coming out of the new APIs, DirectX 12 and Vulkan, and AMD has been leading the charge in supporting them. AMD's unique hardware implementation of asynchronous compute, a DirectX 12 and Vulkan feature that allows for compute and graphics workloads to be handled at the same time rather than inefficiently queued, often translates into significant gains. For example, the Radeon RX 480 saw a 30% increase in DOOM with Vulkan versus OpenGL. Additional games optimized for Radeon graphics include Hitman, Ashes of the Singularity, Total War: Warhammer, and the upcoming titles Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Civilization VI, and Battlefield 1.

Navy Fireman 3rd Class Hopkins was one of 429 men who died when the ship they were on, the USS Oklahoma, sank after being hit by torpedoes Dec. 7, 1941. Thirty-two men were rescued, but 14 Marines and 415 sailors were killed. Many of them, including Hopkins, were buried as “unknowns” in a Hawaii cemetery.
Of the 388 remains of Oklahoma crewmembers disinterred in 2015, about 30 have been identified, according to the agency. Another crewmember, Navy Seaman 2nd Class James N. Phipps, of Rainier, Oregon, also has been identified and will be buried Oct. 17 in Portland, Oregon.
It's important to distinguish between the main character and its creator, especially since many users of social media, and even members of the press, have gotten confused along the way about the fact that Kimberly “La Tocola” Bermúdez is not an actual person.

It is worse than heartbreaking that George W. Bush, as Commander in Chief, caused this country to go to war based on information which was false, and which he knew to be false. The consequences for our troops have been devastating. We have lost 4,116 of our beloved servicemen and women since the war began, with over 30,000 physically wounded and countless others emotionally wounded. The toll on the service persons and their families will be felt throughout their lives.
That stand puts Paul at odds with his fellow Kentuckian, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. Hal Rogers (R), who is pushing for an omnibus. But Paul points out that Republicans just won the midterm elections, and he adds that by passing individual appropriations bills, Republicans can tell President Barack Obama how to spend Americans' money.
Paul also joins incoming Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) in arguing that Republicans should use all their power—including the power of the purse through appropriations and spending restraints—to block President Obama's planned executive amnesty.
Why should an adult woman be forced to lie to her doctor about why she wants to be sterilized? Why can't she just sign paperwork not to sue and be done with this issue? Why should lawsuits against surgeons for women who “change their mind” even be allowed? As a lawyer, I proposed to sign paperwork to prevent that issue every single time I asked about getting a tubal and still had doctors trying to talk me out of it. I never saw any of these doctors offering to pay for these hypothetical kids or gaining the weight and taking the damage to a woman's body that happens because of pregnancy. Maybe they should personally be found liable when some deadbeat mother has a kid and abuses it or lets her boyfriend do it. Then, they might think twice about this baby pushing they're doing.
And according to Behind the Net's QoC, Datsyuk faced the second-hardest competition among Red Wings players, behind only defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom.
"We will not be offering individual exchange plans in 2017 in Indiana. This change does not impact our commercial and Medicare plans," UnitedHealth spokewoman Maria Gordon Shydlo wrote in an email, without further comment.
Burris was sacked twice and also thumped in the head by Edmonton lineman Marcus Howard. He tossed up a couple of balls that were dangerously close to being intercepted, and the RedBlacks were kept from the end zone, having to settle for a Chris Milo field goal.
Under the leadership of Chairman Fred Hampton and Minister of Defense Bobby Rush, the Chicago BPP grew into a strong organization. Hampton began to negotiate with Chicago street organizations, attempting to convince them to give up their violent activities and embrace the Panther philosophy. Under his leadership, the Party built the original Rainbow Coalition that united the Panthers, the Puerto Rican Young Lords Organization, the Young Patriots (a group of radical Appalachian whites) and the Students for a Democratic Society.
Of the five new Council members, four are Jews. Not only Jews, but they are very active in “holocaust” promotion and other causes solely for Jews. The first is Wiesel, who I think has been a member from the beginning, as he was its Founding Chairman in 1980, appointed by Democrat Jimmy Carter. At that time, Wiesel attempted to sell the idea by writing to Carter that Holocaust activists aim to use the commission (set up to create the museum) to “reach and transform as many human beings as possible. We hope to share our conviction that when war and genocide unleash hatred against any one people or peoples, all are ultimately engulfed in the fire.” Of course, this is never applied to Israel, or even the U.S., which proves the hypocrisy of the “remembrance” campaigns of the Jews. The other appointees are:
Roman R. Kent, born in Lodz, Poland (so we know his name is not really Kent) and serves as Chairman of the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Their Descendants, is President of the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous and of the International Auschwitz Committee, and is Treasurer of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.
After I signed up for the exchange and mailed my choice to my giftee, I wasn't paying a lot of attention to redditgifts because there has been a lot going on lately. I have a friend coming from the Czech Republic to visit me and I had to attend a few big job interviews this week (which I now believe is not going anywhere). But one night, when I was in the streets with my friend, my phone kept buzzing! I thought it's my girlfriend looking for me or something, but when I take it out, HOLY COW! I have a lot of new e-mails coming in one by one! When I take a closer look at it, NO SHIT! It's my Santa gifting me with one book and another, I was so stoked and happy that I jumped on the street! I never expected to have received this many books! It's AWESOME!!!

» Fishermen Can Work Together to Improve the Fishery
Fishermen Can Work Together to Improve the Fishery
One of the most rewarding aspects of my involvement in New England fisheries management over the past 10 years has been the opportunity to work with fishermen to find solutions to the problems facing the resource and their fishing businesses. Unfortunately, this past year has been disappointing in one major regard. At a time when there is good cause for optimism, having made historic strides in bringing New England's groundfish fishery back, the year has been marred with too much vitriolic mudslinging and counterproductive tactics by some parts of the industry, and those advocating on their behalf. As a result, we're not as far along as we should be. The fishery would be better served if this frustration were redirected toward finding ways to make the current system work better.
Here are some observations for how more fishermen could come together to improve the fishery in the coming year:
2) Work with political representatives on solutions that address the problems fishermen face now, not measures designed to reinstate policies that failed both the resource and New England's fishing businesses.
3) Work on the management changes already under development, such as permit banks, monitoring program improvements and measures to facilitate more catch of the healthier stocks. With broader engagement from fishermen working together, these proposals could be made stronger.
Eric Schmidt has been out on tour doing his best door-to-door salesman act. The Google Chairman appeared at the Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, armed with a new Nexus 7 and a Nexus Q, and proceeded to demonstrate the both of them. He even went so far as to describe the Q as "cute." Well, it sort of is.

Noble enlisted Portola Coffee Labs in Costa Mesa with its custom El Salvador coffee blend. Beans are hand-selected and roasted specifically for Naughty Sauce. “We let Portola geek out with the blend. We know beer, they know coffee,” says Price with his boyish good looks. He claims that fresh coffee beans “have a fruity quality going in the tank, but impart a bright-roasty character when complete.” Although three pounds of coffee per barrel are used, Portola's owner and master roaster Jeff Duggan confirms a small amount caffeine is infused in the beer, estimating around 20% of the caffeine in a standard 12 oz cup of coffee per pint.

During a news conference with his US counterpart, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm.

I think that people need to see how normal we are. I came forward to do that. I am your average teenage girl who has friends, a boyfriend and so on. I go out, I play Xbox and I love to read. I am a normal person just born in the wrong body.
Missionary sex is better exercise for the man, while the cowgirl position is ideal for the lady. Men can burn about 350 calories per hour in the missionary position, and it's not impossible for a 30-minute session in the cowgirl position to burn 200 or more calories. Talk about an enjoyable way to get in shape!
The dissolute Prince Aly Khan fell in love with Hayworth's image, too. The international playboy of the 1940's, he was famous for his wealth, his racehorses and his love life. He asked Elsa Maxwell, the hostess and public relations woman, to introduce him to the glamorous star. The prince was still married, and his internationally publicized courtship of, marriage to and subsequent divorce from Hayworth were among the factors that ultimately led his father, the Aga Khan - the spiritual leader of 15 million Muslims - to reject his son as his heir and ultimately designate his grandson to succeed him.

The Australian board named 33 male and female players on the list on Monday, and offered contracts for the first time to the left-arm spinner Ashton Agar, the tall fast bowler Billy Stanlake and the batting allrounder Hilton Cartwright, who made his Test debut at the SCG in January. The young batsmen Matthew Renshaw and Peter Handscomb, who impressed on the tour of India, have also been offered their first full contracts, having earned incremental deals over the 2016-17 season.
Apart from Faulkner, O'Keefe, Siddle and Marsh, the wicketkeeper Peter Nevill and batsmen Joe Burns and George Bailey were also not on the list this season. Faulkner, incidentally, was left out of the team for the Champions Trophy, his first omission from an Australia squad for an ICC event since 2012. All the above players are now cast as domestic cricketers who, according to CA's pay offer to the players, do not contribute to the game's financial returns. The chief executive of the Australian Cricketers Association, Alistair Nicholson, emphasised that much still needed to be done before the current MOU expires at the end of June.
Though U.S. policy in Afghanistan is murkier than it should be after more than 12 years of war, this year is expected to mark the formal end of the conflict. In 2014, President Obama has repeatedly said, the nation will bring servicemen and women home – or at least most of them, depending on a possible agreement on a residual force that would remain on the ground.
No, these lobbying efforts are only meant for MPAA's Chairman and CEO Chris Dodd.
The Wall Street Reform Act the MPAA is heavily invested in is also known as the Dodd-Frank Act, as the current MPAA Chairman proposed the act late 2009 when he was still a senator.
Looking at the history of MPAA's lobbying efforts we see that Wall Street Reform was already a topic the movie studios where interested in while Dodd was still acting as senator. Dodd was officially announced as MPAA Chairman March 2011, but the MPAA's lobbying efforts already started in the last quarter of 2010.
When small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had shoulder surgery in early October that will likely sideline him for the entire season, Charlotte brought in veteran swingman Damien Wilkens. Wilkens presented a threat to Harrison making the team, but Wilkins was waived Friday.
Below the ðegns were the ceorls, freemen, farmers and independent landed householders who formed the mainstay of the Saxon kingdom, based as it was on a rural economy. The term free in an Anglo-Saxon context can be misleading, since there were many degrees of freedom. Ceorls were 'folcfry' (folk-free), that is, free in the eyes of the community. They enjoyed weregilds and had the right to seek compensations for other free kinsmen and kinswomen. They were allowed to bear arms and be considered 'fyrd worthy' and 'moot worthy'. This meant they were considered worthy to serve in the fyrd and take part in folk meetings. They did not have the same degree of freedom as ðegns or eoldermen. A ceorl's wereguild was set nominally at 200 shillings, one sixth that of a ðegn. There were three main classes of ceorl, although the dividing line between the classes was indistinct. First were the geneatas, the peasant aristocracy who paid rent to their overlord. geneat originally meant companion, implying that the class originated from the lord's household, often receiving land as a gift. The geneat's duty was also recorded in the same document as the ðegn's law, kotsetla's duty and gebur's duty.
'The kotsetla's duty depends on what is determined for the estate. In some he must work for his lord each Monday throughout the year, or three days each week at harvest-time. He need not pay ground rent. He ought to have five acres; more if it is the custom on the estate; and if it is ever less, it will be too little, because his labour must always be available. He is to pay his hearth-penny on Ascension Day, just as every freeman ought, and serve on his lord's estate, if he is ordered, by guarding the coast, and work at the king's deer-fence, and at similar things according to what his station is; and he is to pay his church dues at Martinmas.'
It is known that Google Search provides 25%-30% of the user's traffic to an average website. As Google executives and PR repeated many times, Google Search service exists to provide the most relevant and useful results to the user's queries. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt even joked that there should be only one result for each query – the result that the user seeks. Google servers crawl the whole web, extracting text, links, and other data from trillions of pages. Google constantly and successfully fights attempts to artificially promote websites through collusive linking, and other search engine optimization techniques. In its undertaking, Google also uses an enormous amount of off-web information, which it collects through Chrome browser, other Google applications and services, analytics beacons, domains registrar status, and so on. This information includes domains popularity and ownership. Google also processes immediate feedback from the users in the form of frequency of clicks on the results, bounce rate, the frequency of repeated searches with modified terms, etc.

“Many airports are complaining that TSA is getting worse, not better,” said Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). He said that 103 of the TSA's 48,000 airport screeners quit each week.
Calgary went with 11 forwards and seven defencemen for the game.
But if the B's do use their draft picks, it's a good year to grab a defenseman who could be NHL-ready in a year or two, maybe even sooner.
• Jakob Chychrun — The sturdy and fast-skating 6-foot-2, 200-pound son of rugged ex-NHL defenseman Jeff Chychrun. He's a talented and mature all-round player who had 11 goals and 38 assists in 62 games in juniors last season for Sarnia of the Ontario Hockey League.
If the Bruins do select a defenseman at No. 14, McAvoy could well be available, and he suits the team's needs as a talented puck-moving, transition blueliner. McAvoy, who won't turn 19 until just before Christmas, likely will spend one or two more seasons with the Terriers before being ready to jump to the pros.
So it will depend on which roster-building route Sweeney chooses — trying to get veteran defensemen via trades or free agency, or through the draft. One way or another, though, the blue line corps needs a big upgrade if the B's plan to return to the playoffs.

Torchetti, a hard-nosed coach, did have some run-ins with players, especially defenseman Ryan Suter between Games 4 and 5 after Suter felt Torchetti called him out publicly for not blocking a shot before a goal against.
Instead, the left would prefer to fan the flames of division by allowing players to kneel on a football field in protest then see a player kneel in prayer. That was proven in the past when Christian quarterback Tim Tebow caused controversy by kneeling and giving thanks to God. If that is not a telling sign of how far our country has fallen, then I don't know what is. If these players in the NFL have the right to kneel to raise awareness to racial oppression, then gentleman like Wentz should be able to mention God and kneel in prayer without criticism.

This video has no narration. It's just an hour of people playing sports around Burlington, with ambient crowd noise and grunting in the background. At around the 37:50 mark, the cameraman pans away from a soccer game to show the mayor holding court behind him. Why? Why not.
In keeping with his theme of stereotypically leftist fundraisers, Sanders invited the local access channel to film a fundraiser at a Burlington wine tasting. Sanders asks just one question at the event—do they have any wines that would appeal to people, like himself, who only drink $3 bottles? This is a tough one to watch, because there's virtually no audio, and the cameraman appears to be standing on an active fault line.
No more, I say! Forget that image of an older gentleman in a robe, nestled into his arm chair in front of a roaring fire, swirling a gigantic snifter of amber liquid in his hand and taking from it the occasional sip. Brandy can be much more than that. Like whiskey or gin, Brandy comes in many varieties, each with its own subtle nuances. It can be bold and bright, subtle and warming, high proof or toned down. It can be mixed with or taken neat, and is just as happy serving as a modifier in a cocktail as taking center stage. In short, it's a versatile, delicious liquor worthy of celebration and a place of honor in your liquor cabinet.
Allen is thought to be determined to push for a starting spot at Anfield, but The Sun have claimed that Swansea Chairman Huw Jenkins is confident the emotional lure of returning to save his boyhood club from relegation could be enough to seal the deal.
The plot of American Gods posits a war brewing between old and new gods: the traditional gods of mythological roots from around the world steadily losing believers to an upstart pantheon of gods reflecting society's modern love of money, technology, media, celebrity and drugs. Its protagonist, Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle), is an ex-con who becomes bodyguard and traveling partner to Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane), a conman who in reality is one of the older gods, on a cross-country mission to gather his forces in preparation to battle the new deities.
Last week, Sanders sent a letter to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz asking not only for additional early debates, but for inter-party debates with Republicans during the primary season. “The people of this country are tired of political gossip, personal attacks and ugly 30-second ads. They want the candidates to engage in serious discussion about the very serious issues facing our country today,” he wrote.
Davison added that he expects Tekno to still be able to compete with the likes of Penske, Triple Eight, and Prodrive, despite not having the manpower of the bigger teams.
Subject: Your wonderful site Dear Sarah, Thank you so much for your wonderful site! It is very informative, well prepared, funny and stimulating, and I find myself going after my girlfriend every time I read it! I would like to share with you some interesting information, as it was derived from your good work. I have loved to eat yoghurt all my life. I specially like it plain, without fruit or sugar. I just love the slightly acid taste it has. I also love to perform cunnilingus on my girlfriend, and have loved it since I first tried it with my first fiancée many years ago. I specially love that acid taste, which I find fascinating. But it wasn't until I read your website that I connected both experiences. In your flora section I learned that it is lactobacillus that produces the acidic taste on both! As I love my girlfriend so much that it hurts, and I want to have her in everything I do, I decided to produce yoghurt with my girlfriend�s lactobacillus. I bought a yoghurt machine, which is just an electric contraption that keeps small cups constantly at body temperature. I put plain milk in each cup, and then with the full and loving help of my girlfriend I swabbed a bit of her vaginal juices and put a small bit in each cup. I then mixed the contents in each cup, plugged the machine and waited overnight. The results were fabulous! I love the product, which I call “Paige's Yoghurt,” and feel a special loving warmth each breakfast as I know I am eating her out! I have taken a few cups to work, which I store in the office fridge. A female co-worker pinched one from me, ate it, and liked it so much that she is asking me where I got it, but I do not dare tell her where it came from! For the new batches I do not have to bother my girlfriend, as I just use part of an old yoghurt to make the new ones. I imagine that the taste and cultures will stabilize with time, as I prepare one batch after the other. I will also try with other types of milk (non-pasteurised, fat free, farm milk, etc). I will keep you posted on new developments, but I urge you to try it. It is worth the trouble! Please keep up the good work. Kindest regards,
The agency is currently weighing proposals for coal ash regulation. One of those proposals would classify the substance as hazardous waste, but two of the amendments tacked onto the GOP budget bill, which itself is bad enough, would prevent the EPA from enforcing any such rule. And they're just two of more than 400 amendments that deserve a little more attention than they've been getting.Amendment 217, sponsored by West Virginia Congressman David McKinley, would prohibit EPA funding for a subtitle C (hazardous waste) rule, essentially forcing the agency to choose subtitle D, meaning coal ash would continue to be classified as nonhazardous.
Amendment 10, from Florida Congressman Cliff Stearns, would do the same thing. Lisa Evans, senior counsel with Earthjustice, wrote: "EPA's only option would be to issue guidelines for states that not mandatory and that are unenforceable by EPA."

As the Austin-American Statesman editorialized this weekend,
2016 deadline: The Capitals made three trades near the deadline, each designed to add depth to a team that management believed was ready to compete for the Stanley Cup. The Capitals added Winnick, forward Ryan Bourque and defenseman Mike Weber, trading Chris Brown, Brooks Laich, Connor Carrick, a 2016 fifth-round pick and a 2017 third-round pick.
GM's deadline track record: This is the first time since 2014 that the Blue Jackets have been playoff contenders approaching the deadline. That year, Kekalainen traded forward Marian Gaborik to the Los Angeles Kings for forward Matt Frattin and two draft picks, and acquired defenseman Nick Schultz from the Edmonton Oilers for a draft pick. With the Blue Jackets in position to compete for the Stanley Cup this season and beyond, it appears unlikely Kekalainen will do anything that might shake up team chemistry.
What they need: An experienced defenseman
2016 deadline: The Penguins made three trades near the deadline. They added defenseman Justin Schultz, forwards Dustin Jeffrey and Matthias Plachta, and a 2017 seventh-round pick, trading forwards Matia Marcantuoni, Dan O'Donaghue and Sergei Plotnikov, as well as a 2016 third-round pick.
GM's deadline track record: Rutherford won't wait for the deadline if he finds a trade offer he likes. His trade for left wing Carl Hagelin last season (for forward David Perron and defenseman Adam Clendening) came on Jan. 16.
What they need: An experienced defenseman
GM's deadline track record: This will be Jeff Gorton's second deadline as GM, and he appears intent to hold on to New York's 2017 first-round draft pick. Because of past trades, including deadline deals for Martin St. Louis (2014) and Keith Yandle (2015), the Rangers haven't had a first-round pick since defenseman Brady Skjei in 2012.
2016 deadline: The Devils were conservative sellers last season because they weren't in a playoff spot but also weren't out of reach. They traded defenseman Eric Gelinas and forwards Lee Stempniak and Stefan Matteau to get forward Devante Smith-Pelly, a second-round draft pick, a third-round pick and a fourth-round pick.
Biggest trade chip: Defenseman Justin Faulk, 24, represented the Hurricanes in the 2017 Honda NHL All-Star Game, but he might be expendable in the right trade for a scoring forward because of Carolina's depth of young defensemen, including Jaccob Slavin, 22, Brett Pesce, 22, and Noah Hanifin, 20.
2016 deadline: The Hurricanes were busy unloading players for assets at the deadline last season, trading forwards Eric Staal and Kris Versteeg, defenseman John-Michael Liles, and goalie Drew MacIntyre, and getting back forwards Aleksi Saarela, Anthony Camara and Valentin Zykov, defenseman Dennis Robertson, two second-round draft picks, a third-round pick, a fifth-round pick, and a conditional fifth-round pick.
A series of reports in The Clarion-Ledger drew attention to state officials who were spending on what appeared to be personal purposes, including cowboy boots, dry cleaning, clothing, groceries, golf outings, windshield repair, apartments in Jackson and out-of-state trips.

Eagles of Death Metal is just one of many bands to feature Homme, whose main gig is Queens of the Stone Age, but he also founded supergroup Them Crooked Vultures with Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Because he's so spread around, Homme doesn't always tour with Eagles of Death Metal, and it's unclear at the moment if he was in Paris. However, it seems likely that he was at Le Bataclan since it was the first show for "Zipper Down," which was released Oct. 2.

Crewman Lost as Sub Sinks Tug Off Coast
Two other Barcona crewmen jumped into the fog-shrouded sea and managed to swim to one of two empty barges that their tug had been towing. Later, the survivors told investigators about their terror when their 97-ton, 73-foot tug was jolted backward and sunk by what seemed an unknown, invisible force.
One crewman of the tugboat Barcona was missing and presumed dead late Wednesday, despite a daylong search that involved four Coast Guard vessels, two helicopters and the Houston--the submarine involved in the accident.

Dallas Stars General Manager Jim Nill announced today that the club has signed defenseman Miro Heiskanen to a three-year entry level contract.
In the U-20 World Junior Championship, he recorded one assist in six games. At the 2017 U-18 World Championship, he registered twelve points (2-10=12) in seven games as Finland captured the silver medal. Heiskanen earned best defenseman honors and was named to the tournament all-star team after leading all skaters in assists and all defensemen in points.
Club Chairman and co-owner Paul Brown stated that: “the resolution of this problem will allow us to continue our development plan to keep Dundalk Football Club moving forward in the right direction, both on and off the field.

Twitter was awash with conspiracy theories within minutes of the 71-year-old's speech in Washington, where he told the servicemen and women: 'On January 20, 2017, I stood on the steps of the capital to herald the day the people became rulers of their nation again,' - before pausing to take a sip of water.
With the return of Kyle Quincey to the lineup on Monday, the Detroit Red Wings officially had seven healthy defensemen. Instead of making the tough decision, the Wings opted to dress all seven defensemen. After watching the team struggle offensively, the Wings will scratch a defenseman before Thursday's game against the Arizona Coyotes. Early indications seem to suggest that Alexey Marchenko will be that scratch, at least initially.
One of the statistics we can look at to evaluate how well a defenseman suppresses shots is the number of 5v5 shot attempts that occur against the team when the player is on the ice versus the team average. This statistic is known as 5v5 Corsi Against/60 RelTm. Ericsson has a CA60 RelTm of 7.04, meaning that when he is on the ice the Red Wings give up 7.04 more shot attempts than their team average. That ranks 131st out of 142 defensemen who have played at least 500 minutes at 5v5 (Source: Puckalytics).
Defenseman 5v5 CA60 Smith 47.03 Marchenko 47.09 Green 47.97 Kronwall 50.60 DeKeyser 53.36 Ericsson 54.68
Last year, Ryan Stimson put together a tracking project that looked at how players can "drive" shot attempts through passing. One of the stats he coined was "5v5 primary passes leading to shot attempts per 60 minutes". This statistic reflects how many times a player makes a pass that leads to a shot attempt without any other passes occurring. It's the last pass before a shot attempt. Here's a graph of Red Wings defensemen showing 5v5 primary passes leading to shot attempts per 60 minutes. Data is limited to the seven games that were tracked earlier in the season by Stimson's team.
One of the ways we can evaluate a player is how they perform relative to their expectations. Steve Burtch has developed a statistic called "dCorsi", a metric that evaluates a player's observed performance vs. their expected performance based on a series of variables. While the statistic has its limitations, we can still use it in the context of our other metrics. When it comes to Ericsson's expected Corsi For/60 vs. his observed Corsi For/60, Ericsson has a dCorsiFor Impact of -45.2, which ranks 256th out of 260 eligible defensemen this season.
Defenseman dCF Impact dCA Impact dCorsiImpact Ericsson -45.20 37.92 -83.12 Kronwall -25.70 4.68 -30.37 DeKeyser -25.37 28.06 -53.43 Green 1.59 -13.54 15.12 Marchenko 24.16 -21.15 45.31 Smith 42.23 -24.54 66.77
As you can see, Marchenko and Smith have been the most impactful players relative to their expectations while Ericsson has by far been the least impactful. When it comes to impacting plays in the offensive zone, defensemen have a variety of ways to impact the game. Timely pinches, successful attempts to join the rush, and the ability to get their shots through to the net are all admired skills of the NHL's top defensemen. Reviewing the tape on Ericsson seems to suggest that he struggles with when to pinch vs. when not to pinch and as a result, this can sometimes derail an offensive play. Check out how an untimely pinch derails this offensive play.

Vancouver Canucks defenceman Dan Hamhuis was scratched for the second straight game against the Montreal Canadiens with an injury, which could put his Olympic status in doubt.
The obvious choice to replace Hamhuis is Brent Seabrook of the Chicago Blackhawks, one of two active defencemen (along with San Jose's Dan Boyle) who won gold in Vancouver in 2010 who didn't make the team this time around. Seabrook is a big body who is in the prime of his career in Chicago, and he's a steadying presence on the ice.
However, the supposed knock against Seabrook in the Sochi process is being a right-handed shot. It's well-known that Canadian assistant coach Ken Hitchcock is a fan of having a left and right-handed defenceman on each pairing, and if Hamhuis can't go, it takes away a left-handed shot.
Fox 13 News reached out to Congressman Chaffetz Saturday for a reaction, and his office declined to comment.
A House GOP source familiar with the matter said House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has asked intelligence agency officials to look "into the whole series of alleged leaks of classified information around the administration's Russia report and to determine if any warrant referral to the Justice Department.”
Meanwhile, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) suggested during a hearing Tuesday that his panel was also looking into media leaks as part of its larger probe into Russia's role in the presidential election.
On Monday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy, D-Vt., sent a letter Monday to the Justice Department's inspector general, wanting to know if the inspector general's office would be looking at Bush-era operations as part of its inquiry into "Fast and Furious."
… A ceasefire might be negotiated and agreed upon. Hamas might soon stop firing rockets, but then will Israel cease to exercise its violence against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank on a daily basis? The reality is that if Palestinians stop resisting, Israel won't stop occupying, as its leaders repeatedly affirm. The besieged Jews of the Warsaw ghetto had a motto “to live and die in dignity.” As I sit in my own besieged ghetto, I think how Palestinians have honored this universal value. We live in dignity and we die in dignity, refusing to accept subjugation. We're tired of war. I, for one, have had enough of bloodshed, death and destruction. But I also can no longer tolerate the return to a deeply unjust status quo. I can no longer agree to live in this open-air prison. We can no longer tolerate to be treated as sub-humans, deprived of our most basic human rights. We are trapped here, trapped between two deaths: death by Israeli bombs and missiles, and death by Israel's blockade of Gaza. We want to be able to get in and out of Gaza freely, whenever we choose. Why should our students not be granted their right to study at universities of their own choice? Why should our patients be left for their own death as Israel deprives them of receiving medical treatment in hospitals outside of Gaza? Our fishermen want to fish in our sea waters without the prospect of being shot at and killed. We deserve the right to access clean water, electricity and our most basic needs. And yet we can't because Israel occupies. It occupies not only our land but our bodies and our destinies. No people can tolerate this injustice. We, too, are humans.
But we shouldn't ignore the subtexts that have long been present in many children's books, whether intentionally or not. They may be born from stereotypes, but as academic Jessica Kander writes, queer characters “can be recognisable to readers through the use of culturally and historically significant markers” – so, for example, depictions of butch girls and tomboys can be read as queer women. The two famous female Georges – Nancy Drew's best friend and the intrepid member of The Famous Five – are tomboys and so have widely been interpreted as queer by readers and academics alike. Another example is Elizabeth Levy's Something Queer Is Going On, whose heroines Gwen and Jill (not Jack and Jill, you'll notice) are best friends. But the subtext is not so subtexty here: queer has, for almost a century, meant homosexual and Levy, who also wrote an expressly lesbian romance novel for teens called Come Out Smiling, was clearly not above sticking overt references in her titles.
GAA Handball National Manager John Kelly stated that Walsh was ""one in a million, a tremendous competitor, a sportsman par excellence and an iconic figure whose loss has left the entire handball community numb with grief."
Flames captain Mark Giordano has one year remaining on a five-year contract. Under the collective bargaining agreement, Treliving says he can't officially sign the 31-year-old defenceman to an extension until July 1.
Giordano, San Jose defenceman Brent Burns and New York Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist are the three finalists for the NHL's Foundation Player Award that goes to an NHL player "who applies the core values of hockey — commitment, perseverance and teamwork — to enrich the lives of people in his community."
Jiri Hudler, David Jones, Joe Colborne, Johnny Gaudreau, Sean Monahan, defenceman Kris Russell and goaltender Jonas Hiller each have a year remaining on their deals.
Defencemen David Schlemko, Rafael Diaz, Corey Potter and goaltender Karri Ramo will be unrestricted free agents.
Republicans on the committee rushed to Gorsuch's defense. Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent out an advisory to reporters stating that the judge “did not invent that legal test” and that he relied on a 1996 decision from his own circuit. The advisory added that Gorsuch's addition of “merely” didn't change the protections for students with disabilities.
The story out of Des Plaines mirrors an incident in California, in which four students were arrested in September as part of a hazing investigation at La Puente High School. Allegations were, similarly, that upperclassmen soccer team members sexually hazed freshman players who were recently promoted to the varsity team.
There are options up front; Ryan Strome, Brock Nelson, Anders Lee. These are the names that have somewhat altered the depth perception of the Islander organization. All three will be regular forwards on the roster within the next few seasons. The problem is there has been so much talk about the promise of these young forwards, that the timetable for the organization's defensemen has been lost in the shuffle.

Time is presented in a fascinating way in Chronicle of a Death Foretold. The standard mystery novel investigation proceeds in a linear fashion. The plot may be complex and the past may play a large role in influencing the present, but the detective pushes through the suspects and clues, determined to move forward and make progress in the case. There are false leads, distractions, and obstacles and the detective backtracks when necessary, but the main thrust of the narrative is straight ahead until the detective arrives at the solution. In Chronicle of a Death Foretold, by contrast, the structure is circular; the narrator tells the tale in such a way that time keeps looping back on itself. Each section begins at a certain point within the few hours that covers the novel's central action, but then the tale goes off into flashbacks and flash forwards, digressions, commentaries on the different people involved. Needless to say, Marquez's craftsmanship is impeccable, and despite all the jumping around, the narrative is extremely tight. In no more than 140 pages, we learn about the histories of numerous characters. We get their backgrounds leading up to the fateful day, and with some, we find out where life took them after the murder. The narrator's journalistic voice is the novel's main one, but often he quotes other people, friends of his from the town, acquaintances. It's a vivid mosaic Marquez creates, a jigsaw puzzle of conflicting perceptions, dreams, thoughts, ambitions, and desires, and the total effect of it all is uncertainty. Yes, we know in great detail exactly what transpired the day Santiago Nasar was killed, but at the same time, somehow, like the people who are part of the drama, we don't understand a damn thing. As the narrator keeps going over the same events from different perspectives, asking questions about this or that incident or encounter, trying to tease out meanings, the story feels more and more dreamlike. The people are like sleepwalkers, or figures moving through a prearranged ritual. While Chronicle of a Death Foretold, strictly speaking, is not a work of magical realism (nothing supernatural happens in it), it ranks among the strangest of Marquez's works specifically because it is based in quotidian “reality” and that reality is inexplicable. Indeed, the narrator describes a judge who writes a 500 page brief about the case but who himself can't grasp its core. The case disturbs the judge because “he never thought it legitimate that life should make use of so many coincidences forbidden literature, so that there should be the untrammeled fulfillment of a death so clearly foretold.”
Boehner's successor will almost certainly be Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), who was one of the self-declared “young guns” of the House, a posse that also included House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan and former representative Eric Cantor (Va.). Cantor, the then-majority leader, was defeated in 2014 by economics professor and now-Freedom Caucus member Dave Brat.

The Blue Jays currently have 34 players on their 40-man roster, and that does not include designated hitter Kendrys Morales, whose three-year deal has yet to become official. Toronto also needs a pair of corner outfielders, a first baseman and at least a couple of arms in the bullpen, so there isn't quite as much open roster space as one might think.
Outside of the Top 30, there are some other intriguing candidates. Right-hander Wil Browning posted a 1.94 ERA in Double-A before joining the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons late in the season. Twenty-two-year-old Adonys Cardona didn't make it as a starter, but he moved to the bullpen last season in Dunedin and could move quickly through the system. Catcher/first baseman Juan Kelly hit .274 with an .804 OPS in 131 games for Lansing. Utility man Jon Berti can play just about anywhere, and he had a .722 OPS for New Hampshire.
Feeling its dense weight in his palm, the image of the blood-drenched madman surfaced in his mind.
The troublesome reductions in manpower caused by back strains, twisted ankles and strange diseases often left a ship's captain without enough sailors to get underway - a problem both bad for business and a strain on the nation's economy.
Dame Di Ellis, Honorary President and former Chairman of British Rowing passed away on Thursday, 18 May after a short illness
Competitively, Dame Di rowed for Great Britain, coxed for England, won national championships gold and won the Women's Eights Head of the River Race seven times both as a rower and a cox. She was a club member of St George's RC, a qualified umpire, secretary of events and Chairman of a number of committees and commissions. Dame Di was Chairman of British Rowing (formerly the Amateur Rowing Association) for 24 years and was a FISA (World Rowing) delegate, representing Great Britain's position on the international stage.
Sir Hugh Robertson, Chairman of the BOA, said: “This is a sad day for the entire Olympic Movement in this country. Anyone who worked with Di would know that she was not only passionate about sport and its role in society, but driven to see greater opportunities carved out for all, especially for women in sport.

Republican Congressman Mike Kelly was talking to a crowd in his district of Northwestern Pennsylvania earlier this month when he dropped a serious accusation against Barack Obama. He noted the former president had decided to stay in Washington, and not for the reasons Obama has given.
Congressman Mike Kelly accused President Barack Obama of operating a shadow government, saying he was only staying in Washington, D.C. for that "one purpose and one purpose only." Yet there is no evidence Obama is running a shadow government, and Obama has provided another purpose for why he's staying in Washington: so his daughter Sasha can finish high school. Kelly's spokesperson later walked back the Congressman's statement, saying "Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government."

The more drastic changes of the '90s, however, occurred on the city's outskirts. Modest Mouse frontman Isaac Brock's native Issaquah, a town located some 15 miles east of Seattle in the foothills of the Cascades, was a sleepy logging community of under 8,000 residents in 1990. In 1996, a year before The Lonesome Crowded West's release, Costco moved its headquarters there. “It started out as a cute little town,” Brock said of Issaquah in a 2012 documentary on the album. “And I got to see it very quickly just get mall-fucked.”
Growing up in a working-class family, Brock's view of work as something involving physical labor and tangible results bled into a clear disapproval of the white-collar jobs and intellectuals flooding into his region. Over the course of The Lonesome Crowded West, he takes aim at doctors, lawyers, cinematographers, writers, and dot-com boomers, alternately calling them “cash thieves” or “pornographers,” yelling at them to shut up, or, most memorably, ethering them with, “Working real hard to make internet cash/ Work your fingers to the bone sitting on your ass.” He mocks yuppies by stealing their jargon (“Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene”) and extrapolating their wasteful mindset to more dire situations (“Should have insured that planet before it crashed”). Cities, Brock seems to say on “Convenient Parking” and “Bankrupt On Selling,” are unlimited hells built to store and sell useless commodities, populated with “businessers” buying and selling all their trash to each other. Not only that, but it was starting to “bleed out onto the highways” and into rural areas.
Lawmakers provided $110 billion to rebuild the Gulf Coast after Katrina, thanks in part to dogged efforts by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran, R-Miss. The Bush administration, politically scalded by criticism over its botched response to the tragedy, signed off on the aid.
Even worse, those charges came just months after Huerta was disciplined for using the Department of Motor Vehicles' database to look up personal information on the boyfriend of a fellow cop. Two years before that, Huerta was reprimanded after a news reporter said he'd grabbed him by the neck to force him away from a crime scene.
Three other disciplinary reports appeared in Huerta's personnel file. In one, filed on March 19, 2012, Huerta was accused of using MDPD computers to access the DMV's driver information database. According to the report, on April 24, 2010, Huerta looked up info on the boyfriend of an MDPD female sergeant. The report also alleged that in September that year, the boyfriend asked Huerta to look up information on another person, which he did. Those searches originally landed him a three-day suspension, which was later reduced to a written reprimand.
He was one of those batsmen kids tried to emulate. He made elbow pads famous. On a hot day, he could bat for hours on end, bowing his head only to let the sweat drip off his visor, getting ready to withhold another wave of opposition attack.
It was his selflessness on the pitch that made him a true gentleman in real life as well. It supplied the mortar to the bricks that made him The Wall.

Moreover, Kuljanishvili was the first Georgian serviceman whose name was carved into a memorial stone of a legendary US Army unit – the 101st Airborne Division 3rdBrigade Combat Team (BCT). The Defence Minister showed the soldier's mother a picture of his son's name being there.

Yet, both men were arrested. The governor and his allies argue that a federal court ruling that allows officials to establish permit requirements has cleared the way for a wholesale rejection of constitutional values. They will find they are wrong, just as Adams and his associates did when they had Vermont Congressman Matthew Lyon and editor Benjamin Franklin Bache arrested. But the fact that judges and juries will eventually reject Walker's flawed premises does not clean up the mess that the governor has made. When local elected officials and magazine editors are being arrested, real damage is done to the rule of law and to the broad understanding of basic liberties.
"The decision to end manufacturing in Australia reflects the perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces in the country, including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production, small domestic market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto market in the world," GM Chairman and CEO Dan Akerson said in the statement.

In the fall, frontman Paul Westerberg and bassist Tommy Stinson got together in Minneapolis and recorded a five-track covers EP. Missing was original drummer Chris Mars, who opted not to take part, and original guitarist Bob Stinson, who died in 1995 at the age of 35. The motivation for the reunion was the stroke suffered by guitarist Slim Dunlap, Bob Stinson's replacement in The Replacements, in February of 2012. The idea was to auction off 250 vinyl copies of the EP — titled Songs For Slim — with all benefits going to Dunlap. As planned, the auction went off earlier this year, and the results were pretty great.
In an angry letter sent to ODNI chief James Clapper on Monday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he was “dismayed” that the top US intelligence official had not informed the panel of the CIA's analysis and the difference between its judgment and the FBI's assessment, Reuters reported.
The CIA said it has concluded with "high confidence" that Russia sought to influence the US election on behalf of Mr Trump. The finding alarmed legislators, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman McCain who said he planned to put senator Lindsay Graham, a staunch critic of Mr Trump, in charge of investigating the claim.
JAY CARNEY, White House: The Republicans -- again, I can cite numerous Republicans, including one Congressman who referred to his fellow Republicans as lemmings wearing suicide vests. Numerous Republicans have used the hostage analogy. Numerous Republican commentators have used the gun to the head analogy. I hardly think this is unique. Again, if you're suggesting that hurt feelings are why we shut down the government
To most looking in, Rebecca Bunch has a great life: a high powered job as an attorney in a prestigious New York law firm, great future prospects in her chosen profession, looks, brains, and money. But she has always suffered from anxiety and depression, for which she is on a plethora of pills. Those maladies are largely from being pushed by her overbearing Jewish mother, which also led to Rebecca's father abandoning the family when she was young. When on the streets of New York Rebecca runs into Josh Chan, her boyfriend from summer camp ten years ago when they were sixteen, she remembers back to that time as the happiest time in her life, happiness which eludes her. When Josh mentions that he is imminently moving back to his hometown of West Covina, California, Rebecca decides to pursue happiness in moving to West Covina herself, telling people it's because she got a fabulous job there, where in reality it's to rekindle a relationship with Josh, which she believes is what will make ...

That makes perfect sense with Jones likely to command a sizable contract, and you can only spend so much money at one position. A.J. Green is eating up $15 million per year, so it's pretty much certain that the Bengals won't re-sign Jones and Sanu. This news also comes after Sanu just proposed to his long-time girlfriend on Sunday, and she of course said yes.
Chamber of Commerce to Spend $100 Million To Target "Right-Wing" Tea Party Congressmen Because Corporate Welfare is as American as graft.

John Boehner (R-OH) announced that he would be resigning from Congress. As Roll Call noted, the chamber�s "top targets in 2016 will be right-wing, tea party candidates" and its ultimate goal is to reportedly win back "the soul of the Republican Party" for the GOP establishment establishment by helping elect more moderate candidates "in contested primaries to strengthen their hand during policy debates on the Hill."

The 2-year-old rescue pooch nosed out a thumb drive that humans had failed to find during a search of Fogle's Indiana house in July, several weeks before he agreed to plead guilty to having X-rated images of minors and paying to have sex with teenage girls.
Beatty then stepped up to the mic to explain that he had been handed the Best Actress card in error. “I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La land,” he told the stunned audience. “That's why I took such a long look at [co-presenter] Faye. I wasn't trying to be funny.”
As for Boudreau's thoughts on the blue line, I'll paraphrase. The right-side defensemen will be John Carlson, Mike Green and Dennis Wideman, whom Boudreau described as “good to go and champing at the bit,” after missing the playoffs with a leg hematoma
The left side defensemen will be Karl Alzner, Roman Hamrlik and Jeff Schultz/John Erskine/Tom Poti.
That, however, doesn't mean the third-pairing, left-side defenseman will automatically be Erskine. Boudreau said Schultz will be in much better shape in next month's training camp next versus last season and, in his opinion, “is going to open up some eyes.”

Our shop is very well established in most every way, but this week I pretty much got called a cheat by a newer customer who doesn't know us. Straight to my face. After delivering the bad news concerning the aforementioned 5-year-old heavy-duty truck needing so much work he pretty much shot the words "BS" and "I don't believe it." That's fine. I guess if I had a 5-year-old pickup truck that seemed to drive fine, (mind you, it didn't) I'd be pretty upset too at a mechanic telling me I was on the hook for $1,600 worth of work, none of it warranty. What's worse, if it doesn't get the work done, it doesn't get a sticker for the state. Mr. Officer keeps CLOSE tabs on that around here. of course, this fine gentleman waited until last minute — that is, Aug. 30 — to get his inspection done.
Congressman Heller, a former stockbroker, state assemblyman, and Nevada Secretary of State, would add a strong conservative voice to the Senate Republican caucus.

Analysis This is not the first time this kind of incident has happened. Last November a member of the Afghan National Police opened fire on British soldiers he was serving alongside. He killed five and seriously injured half a dozen others. But the Ministry of Defence is anxious to highlight how rare these kinds of incidents are. Since 2006, British forces have trained 130,000 Afghan troops. Some 5,000 of the 10,000 British servicemen currently deployed in Afghanistan are working alongside members of the Afghan Security forces day in and day out. The training and mentoring of Afghanistan's army and police is essential to the goal of eventually leaving an Afghanistan capable of looking after its own security. That is why Liam Fox is stressing that, despite this tragedy, British forces will "continue to work shoulder to shoulder with the Afghans" and will not be deterred. Royal Marine dies in Afghanistan
Live Help with friends. This is amazing. Being in a long distance relationship like I am, gaming together is a very important thing for my girlfriend and I. Games are hard sometimes, and being able to jump in and use her controller for her from anywhere in the world is an amazing idea. “Alright, this might be worth getting… maybe.” I muttered to myself. I wasn't ready to announce I would ever play a Sony console.
Still, I relented waving the PlayStation flag. My fanboy tendencies are the last defense I have against admitting Chris was right… I can't do that. Capcom and Square Enix had some nice games, but Final Fantasy was never my thing, and Deep Down just looks like “Dragons Dogma Two,” which wasn't really my cup of tea from what I've seen from it. Just a Skyrim clone that wasn't as good.
Many people are familiar with the famous tale, the Count of Monte Cristo, written by Alexandre Dumas (who also penned the Three Musketeers) but not many people know that the story was inspired by his father, the first person of colour to become a brigadier general, divisional general and the first general in chief of the French Army. During the French Revolution, Thomas- Alexander Dumas led a group of mixed-race swordsmen called the “Free Legion of Americans,” or better known as their nickname the “Black Legion.” He started his military career when he enlisted as a private at the age of 24 in 1786 in the Queen's Dragoons. In his sixteen years of service he quickly rose through the ranks and served in numerous military campaigns.

The Rays need a second baseman now that Logan Forsythe has been traded. Their most obvious move is to move Brad Miller to second base and replace him with one of the several passable but unexciting first base options left on the market. They could nab Profar, however, who is most suited to second. Meanwhile, the Rangers have been rumored to be close to signing Mike Napoli for some time to cover their 1B job, which Profar is currently slated to share in a platoon while subbing elsewhere around the diamond. Napoli in Texas and Profar in Tampa Bay makes a lot of sense.
It says something of the evolution of limited overs batting in the past decade that we now take for granted that batsmen will fearlessly employ the “Dilscoop”, as it came to be known in honour of its most famous practitioner. In truth this shot has existed for decades at the fringes of big-time cricket but it was Zimbabwe's Doug Marillier and Western Australian Ryan Campbell who pioneered its use at moments that previously called for convention. Campbell was playing it 15 years ago but the shot was perfected by the Sri Lanka opener Tillakaratne Dilshan.
Normally played in the closing overs, the premise is simple but the execution far less so; get in line with the ball, crouch – usually on one knee – and use the pace of the ball to flick it over both your own and the wicketkeepers' head down to the region between third man and fine leg. A lot can go wrong here. The batsman might flick it into their own body or face, to a straight delivery they can miss and be trapped in front or bowled and it's hard to control the exact destination of the ball once contact is made.
There's a slightly maddening debate – often engaged by Ian Chappell – to say that right-handed batsmen are actually “right-facing left-handed batsmen” and left-handed batsmen vice versa. Following this thread, it sort of makes senses that as prodigious a ball-striker as Australia's David Warner, who happens to bowl and throw with his right hand, should be adept at switching his hands and using that right hand as his “bottom hand” to heave the ball into the stands at what would be cow corner to the traditional right-hander.
This differs from the traditional reverse sweep because the batsman – Warner and Kevin Pietersen the most notable exponents in this case – has no intention of keeping the ball down. Again it can break up the rhythm of the bowler and it's not merely unconventional, it's a statement of dominance and aggression. Warner's most celebrated version of the stroke, against India's Ravi Ashwin, helped him stop the bowler from coming around the wicket and defensively angling the ball in towards the pads to curb scoring. Pietersen tended to play his over the cover fence but Warner's goes straighter and is thus a little harder to set a field to. Despite the reservations of many, it's also now MCC-approved.
We're using the safety of a familiar term here but this shot, where the batsman steps towards off, drops to one knee and uses the pace to play a hybrid sweep/glance/hook over the fine leg fence has too many different mutations to categorise firmly. At the Wanderers, De Villiers played three of the most absurd and exhilarating versions you're ever likely to see, making the potentially fraught act of batting in a game of international cricket look like the cartoonish imaginings of a video game.
Since we seem to have wound up obsessing on percentages, I suppose twelve dead Germans is likewise an insignificant percentage, and far too trivial to sophisticates to warrant "Mark Steyn-esque hysteria". But it is December 20th, and for the victims' families in five days' time that will be 100 per cent of their children or parents or boyfriends or girlfriends missing at the Christmas table. Say a prayer for them: They died because of the recklessness of a western political class that has doubled down on a mad long-shot sociopolitical experiment that can only end catastrophically.
“My boyfriend and brother are in soccer clubs and I'm a major soccer fan myself; we're Mexican, so it's in our blood,” she laughs. “Although I enjoy playing soccer indoors, I prefer to watch outdoor soccer. I know so many people that would love to have an outdoor team and I would join myself.”
Since 1954, Sports Illustrated magazine has annually presented the Sportsperson of the Year award to "the athlete or team whose performance that year most embodies the spirit of sportsmanship and achievement."[16][17] Roger Bannister won the first-ever Sportsman of the Year award thanks to his record-breaking time of 3:59.4 for a mile (the first-ever time a mile had been run under four minutes).[16][18] Both men and women have won the award, originally called "Sportsman of the Year" and renamed "Sportswoman of the Year" or "Sportswomen of the Year" when applicable; it is currently known as "Sportsperson of the Year."

The bottom of the current White Sox lineup is a disaster, of course. If there's anything preventing a reload instead of a rebuild, it's the daunting task of finding a third baseman and a shortstop and a second baseman. And maybe a catcher. And probably another starting pitcher. All on a mid-level payroll. It would sure be easier to grab the basket of prospects, run to the cellar and hang out for a couple years.
With one assist under his belt already, Pettersson took a pass from linemate Alexander Nylander and tried to feed captain Lias Andersson to complete what would have been a fancy tap-in goal. Instead, the puck went off Swiss defenceman Tim Berni and in.
Pettersson's second goal was a thing of beauty. It was an incredible individual effort, a power move from the blue line in, as he left Swiss defenceman Simon le Coultre and goaltender Matteo Ritz in his wake. It was also arguably the nicest goal of the tournament. He describes it this way:
Count Andersson, who replaced Linus Lindstrom as the wingers' centreman for the third, among that group.
The queen's reign, however, has not been without controversy. She was seen as cold and out-of-touch following the 1996 divorce of her son, Prince Charles, and Princess Diana, and again after Diana's 1997 death in a car crash. Additionally, the role in modern times of the monarchy, which is largely ceremonial, has come into question as British taxpayers have complained about covering the royal family's travel expenses and palace upkeep. Still, the royals are effective world ambassadors for Britain and a huge tourism draw. Today, the queen, an avid horsewoman and Corgi dog lover, is one of the world's wealthiest women, with extensive real-estate holdings and art and jewelry collections.
Spokesman Nick Schwellenbach told The Daily Caller News Foundation that OSC isn't a party to settlement offers, and simply relays management offers, so the complainant can decide on their own whether to accept them. He said investigations that would lead to OSC punishing retaliators, in cases where an agency refuses to punish its own managers, are separate and would take significantly longer.
The recently promoted Phillips, Reed, and Mayfield are making substantial contributions to this team that already had a core of good young players. Kemmer is not often mentioned in trade talks, and his name is not on the Baseball America prospects list. However, his potent bat is a big part of the picture at Whataburger Field. Third baseman Moran got off to a slow start and spent some time on the disabled list, but has begun to hit and has raised his average to .291 in 53 games.
Much of this coaxing was to be done by the first lady. One memo noted that Rep. John Dingell, the powerful chair of the energy and commerce committee, was pessimistic about enacting comprehensive reform. “The best way to get Chairman Dingell back on board…is to make him feel that we need him (as we do),” an aide advised Hillary Clinton. Rep. Jack Brooks, who headed the House judiciary committee, was interested in limiting the antitrust exemption for the insurance industry. (“What he wants to hear is that you are aware of his legislation and that you and the President would like nothing less than to undercut his efforts in any way.”) New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had recently taken over the Senate finance committee, also was “nervous,” believing that “health care reform will be complex, controversial, and potentially expensive.” So Hillary was advised to focus on Sens. George Mitchell and Jay Rockefeller, other Democrats on the committee, who “have the potential to actually (although not visually) run the Committee on this issue.” One memo noted the “desire” of several moderate Republicans to work with the White House, but it reported that these members “fear about how it will be perceived by the rest of Republicans.” Prior to a meeting with several GOP senators, who were expected to complain about the lack of White House outreach, Hillary Clinton was advised to quickly push “for movement to ‘this is all water under a bridge' language.” Another memo called for establishing a “time sensitive Mrs. Clinton thank you note system following important (does not have to be all) meetings with Members.” A memo laying out the grand political strategy for the Clintons' health care reform project described an “essential” component: “Keep the health care industry divided, both in terms of whether they support or oppose us, and in terms of keeping them from ganging up on any single part of the overall package.”
One intriguing memo to Hillary Clinton prepping her for a meeting with Rep. Jim McDermott, a Washington Democrat who was a fierce advocate of a single-payer system. Though Clinton's reps had been telling progressive groups and unions in private meetings that she believed a single-payer health insurance program made sense, she and her aides had ruled it out for her health care initiative (due to the political opposition such a proposal would draw) and had opted for a much more complicated overhaul based on a requirement that employers provide health insurance through HMOs. Still, as this memo noted, Clinton couldn't afford to tick off the single-payer crusaders: “Cultivating a good and close relationship with the Congressman is becoming more and more important to us. Our House target list is filled with single-payer advocates, many of whom will look to him for a sign-off. Therefore, as difficult as it probably will be, we need to keep him happy and on our side.” The memo reported that at a recent meeting of House Democrats, McDermott had spoken “at some length about how the single payer system was so much easier to describe than the plan he thought the Administration would be proposing” and suggested that McDermott had a rather elevated view of his own role in the ongoing health care reform debate.
As with all Members, and particularly Congressman McDermott, the goal at this meeting is to make him feel we are listening to him and desirous of his guidance. In this vein, you should consider throwing anything he throws at you as a complication right back at him with a question. Then, if you have concerns about his suggested approach, you can address it with him directly. (This way, you don't allow him the opportunity to pick apart anything before you have had a chance to hear and analyze his alternatives).
“That PEOTUS Trump would attack Congressman Lewis on MLK Day weekend for “all talk…no action” when he bled to actually “Make America Great” is why far less than half the country supports him at the dawn of his presidency.”
Atlanta City Council President Ceasar Mitchell called Trump's response to Lewis a “vicious attack” and “only serves to validate the sentiment initially expressed by Congressman Lewis.

As scheduled singerwas in a Southern California courtroom this morning for a readiness conference related the State's case against him for allegedly attempting to hire a hitman to kill his wife.Today's hearing was slated to be a "readiness conference," an appearance at which all parties determine whether the case can be disposed of without trial. According to Lambgoat's courtroom mole, however, such a discussion did not end up taking place today. Although Lambesis was present (accompanied by his parents and attorney Tom Warwick), he was not called forward, and the bailiff subsequently announced that further proceedings have been delayed until February 6th.Notably, there was also a hearing today to review Meggan Lambesis's restraining order against her estranged husband, and we believe that the order was renewed, though we don't have official confirmation as of yet.We'll update you with any relevant information as it comes in.Prosecutor Claudia Grasso subsequently revealed to Lambgoat's contact that criminal proceedings have been delayed "for further negotiations." Grasso confirmed that the next date as February 6. From all angles, it almost certainly appears that Tim Lambesis is attempting to work out a plea deal with the prosecution. Stay tuned.
Xico volcano sits at the extreme southern end of the Mexico City megalopolis. For a geologically significant chunk of time, this area was underwater, drowned by Lake Chalco. The lake began to dry out in the 1300s, and Aztec fishermen settled along its coastline hereabouts. In the nineteenth century, the government drained the lake entirely; the fishermen were awarded communal land grants and told to become farmers.
“Much of that drop is attributable to the carry over effect we experienced in the international student decline from fall enrollment,” Spokesman Seath Bauguess said.
Miami's enrollment increase is credited to the record setting sizes of incoming freshmen classes at the school, according to Susan Schaurer, assistant vice president for enrollment management and director of admissions. In fall 2015, Miami set a record with 3,806 incoming freshmen and fall semester 2016 had the second highest increase with 3,798, Schaurer said.
Economics Minister and Jewish Home Chairman Naftali Bennett toured communities and factories in the south on Thursday, in a show of solidarity with communities barraged by rocket fire.
Transfer, which also correlates with lower completion rates, was more common than average among black and Hispanic freshmen at four-year colleges. At two-year institutions, the discrepancy between plans to transfer to a four-year college and actually doing so was greater for black and Hispanic students than for white and Asian-American students.
At a March 5 meeting with the undercover agent, Yee explained how Mindanao, a southern island of the Philippines, was largely populated by Muslim rebel groups, including the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which had many factions. The state senator told the agent Muslims in Mindanao had access to a lot of money and were financed by Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi before his death, according to the complaint.

At last year's SOTU speech when Congressman Joe Wilson Addison (Joe) Graves WilsonPollster says younger lawmakers more likely to respond to State of the Union on social media The State of the Union is obsolete Dem leaders avert censure vote against Steve King MORE (R-S.C.) yelled "you lie" to President Obama over his debatable claims on illegal immigrants receiving taxpayer-funded healthcare under ObamaCare, he was both criticized and praised. An awkward moment to say the least, but we should all be willing to live with some uncomfortable moments in the name of democracy. As well, when President Obama, standing literally just feet away from the Supreme Court justices, used the State of the Union speech to slam them for a decision he wished had gone the other way, he was all but begging for a response. Justice Samuel Alito merely silently mouthed the words, "That's not true" and all hell broke loose. Whether one agreed with the court's Citizen United ruling or not, the President of the United States confronting the very court who handed down the decision should not expect to do so without some sort of response. It seemed more like intimidation by a president than discourse, under those circumstances. The decades-long debate over Roe v. Wade should serve as an illustration over how passionate those on both sides can be about their position. It is simply not a reasonable expectation that Obama would go un-responded-to by the justices at that moment.
"New York is truly a great sports town," said Woking FC Chairman Mike Smith. "When we learned that an MLS was engaged in a desperate, shortsighted rush to pack as many teams into New York as possible because to try and gain relevance in that area instead of working with existing teams, we jumped on it.."
The Angels' position players were productive in 2016, as any group of hitters led by Mike Trout will tend to be. Trout, Kole Calhoun and Andrelton Simmons give the Angels a formidable core, and the team also seems somewhat settled at third base (where they'll almost certainly exercise the option of the productive Yunel Escobar, although perhaps it's at least faintly possible they could move Escobar to second and try to acquire a third baseman instead) and 1B/DH (where they have C.J. Cron and Pujols' immovable contract).
CNN reporter Sasha Herriman and cameraman Peter Kavanagh were filming in Oxford Street, London's busiest retail area, when the raiders took a sledgehammer to the store's windows in broad daylight.

SANO: The Twins' third baseman easily qualified for the 30-second bonus time with each of his first five home runs going for the required 440 feet or farther. The Twins slugger finished with 11 homers, including a 470-foot shot that's longer than anything he's hit in 2017.
MOUSTAKAS: Moose staged a valiant challenge to the solid score put up by Sano. After homering on his first swing, he fell into a seven-out slump before a burst of nine homers in 12 swings put him in contention. However, with a little less than a minute remaining in the round, the Royals' third baseman fell just short. His final homer, a 114-mph shot, fell three feet shy of 440 feet, which would have triggered 30 seconds of bonus time.
BOUR: The Marlins' first baseman put on a show for the hometown crowd, launching 22 home runs opposite Judge, who is MLB's home run leader. Bour called his timeout with just over a minute remaining and only one home run at 440 feet or greater, but he came back and mashed nine more, five of them exceeding 440 feet to easily clinch a bonus 30 seconds. Bour used that time wisely, adding three more to establish a new Round 1 high.
Trey Gowdy is a true statesman – and there are so few of those left. The South Carolina Representative has absolutely had it with the disrespect for the law being shown by Hillary Clinton's minions.

There is a positive male character in The Vagina Monologues, a man who so loves vaginas that he teaches his girlfriend to love her own vagina. Sommers dismisses this character entirely, for the transparently ridiculous reason that the character is describes as being bland on first meeting (although he later proves to be an unusually great lover, because he loves women's sex parts so much). It's hard to respond to Sommers' argument, because it's not even an argument; it's just an irrelevant statement. He is a positive character; he doesn't mysteriously cease being a positive character because he seems bland at first, or because he loves vaginas.
That seems right to me. I can't claim to have worked as much with feminists as David Cohen; but I've been a women's studies major, occasionally volunteered for feminist causes, and virtually all my friends for the past 20 years have been feminists. And, with one exception, my experiences have been similar to David's. If man-hating is so pervasive in contemporary feminism, why don't men in feminism encounter it more?
That one exception is, the internet. Years ago, on Ms Magazine's feminist bulletin board (this was in the dark ages, before blogs even) I met a handful of self-proclaimed radical feminists who'd say genuinely man-hating things: men are biologically inferior to women, all men consciously plot to keep all women in fear of rape, and so forth. These women were a minority of posters on the Ms boards (and a minority among the radical feminists there), and many other posters objected to these statements.
Nonetheless, these bigoted, anti-male views do exist among a small minority of feminists, and ever since the Ms Boards I can no longer say I've never encountered any genuinely man-hating feminists. But to claim that such views are the dominant philosophy of contemporary feminism is nonsense.

The run to the championship was jump started by DiMaggio's streak. It is ironic that the streak began against the White Sox, who on at least four occasions nearly ended DiMaggio's streak themselves. However, it was the Indians, not the White Sox who finally held the Yankee Clipper hitless. On July 17, third baseman Ken Keltner made two terrific back handed stops to rob DiMaggio of two hits, ending the streak. DiMaggio had ninety-one hits in two-hundred twenty-three at bats during the stretch, hitting .409. The Yankees had the last laugh, as they won the game, and later the World Series.

A BRITISH man has been sentenced to four years and four months in jail for manslaughter after he killed a friend who poked his girlfriend on Facebook.
A new update to Campfire Creations' Stone Age has addressed the game's only significant shortcoming: it's now a Universal app. The update also adds a new tougher AI caveman to match wits with and buffs out a few remaining dents. It's a very inclusive patch: even the iPad 1 -- which actual cavemen used -- is covered.
Though the iPad version isn't massively different from the iPhone edition, there are a lot of man-hours that have gone into this update. "We had three goals with the iPad version," Campfire's John Meindersee told me today. "Provide iPad Retina graphics, keep the same, simple user experience on the iPad that we had on the iPhone, and keep file size under 150-200mb. The iPad version of Stone Age has all the same functionalities that the original had. If you know how to play Stone Age on iPhone then picking it up on iPad will be a breeze. However, we have created all new Retina graphics and redistributed items on screen to give it a less "cluttered" look."Kelsey loved the adaptation of the famous Hans im Glück board game when he reviewed it back in December , and the game has been steadily improved ever since. Stone Age is one of the very best board game adaptations on iOS: the Universal update makes it indispensible.I've been talking to Campfire recently and they've got a very interesting project lined up for their next trick -- though not one that can be named just yet. Watch this space.
“The community of shooting enthusiasts, of gun owners, of law enforcement personnel, military persons, these individuals and these groups are outraged by this law,” said Stapleton, the lawyer. “Now, to be certain, Sandy Hook was a terrible tragedy, and it was an awful awful thing and everyone agrees to that, but this reaction to Sandy Hook is not the way to solve the problem that Sandy Hook presents… I don't know how you prevent a madman from going out and killing someone. I don't know how you can prevent that.”
Magazines are containers that hold a bunch of cartridges, and are inserted into a gun to load it all at once, making reloading quick. Unless a gun looks like an old-time cowboy or a bird-hunter might use it, it probably has a magazine. A magazine itself is just a little sheet metal or plastic box with a spring insode (much like a Pez dispenser), and presents no danger of any kind. For pistols, they're contained entirely in the grip, and for rifles, they usually stick out below the bottom, in front of the trigger.

Kuchiki Toko—his first client, the girl who asked him to search for her true self. Her manner is distinctly boyish as she remarks: “Heya – so we meet again, Mr. Detective.” The body count continues to rise. What should be a simple search for some students is starting to grow out of control. For some reason, the number of missing people and unidentified bodies don't match up.
Soriano batted .284 with 98 home runs, 270 RBIs and 121 stolen bases in 501 games during that span. Even with the arrival of Robinson Cano, Soriano's 209 hits and 39 home runs in 2002 remain the most by a Yankees second baseman in a single season.
In the 'democractic' Islamic Republic of Pakistan which has held seats at the UN Human Rights Council, there are no deterrents for these actions. Pakistani citizens, despite being an empowered populace, freely mobile, and with access to all forms of media, have consistently shown themselves unmotivated to act in the defense of Pakistan's Christians, Shias, Sufis, Hazaras, Ahmadi Muslims, Ismaeeli Muslims, young girls attempting to get an education in the SWAT, nurses risking their lives to vaccinate babies against polio, their heroic statesmen including Governor Salman Taseer or Minister Shabbaz Bhatti or indeed any other vulnerable group.

Iowa State's first-year, full-time student retention rate increased to 87.6 percent, well above the national average and just under ISU's record of 87.7 percent set in fall 2011. The average ACT score for new freshmen also has increased the last three years, to 25.17 in fall 2016.

And so Jackson asks: Dear reader, have you, too, lost your mind? Can you ever be sure you had one to lose in the first place? Have you ever mistaken the mew of a cat in heat for someone being murdered? Have you ever thought you saw your own self waiting at the crosswalk as you drive past in your car? Do you trust your own perceptions? And how far will you walk down a road at night before the wind at your back feels like the hands of a madman pushing you forward? Will you run? How fast? And whose door will you knock on? Everything looks perfectly normal as you rush up the front steps, and maybe you've just been spooked, maybe you're just being silly. In Jackson's world, the safe house is a trap. Enter it, and you might get lost in the dark.

The police laughed when I said I had a woman stalker. But she's cost me my home, my girlfriend and my sanity
Thankfully, this meant I spent less time at my home in Tulse Hill, south London, because I stayed with my girlfriend instead. It wasn't easy, though. A few times, when I woke to find a woman lying next to me, I leapt out of bed in fright.
On other occasions my girlfriend had to soothe me when I woke a shivering, sweaty mass and gasping for breath. She was always calm and understanding, but it can't have been a comfortable experience sleeping next to me.
By New Year, my girlfriend and I were rowing regularly, always at my instigation. Even though I went to see a therapist (the third since the stalking began), it wasn't enough to save our relationship. In February 2012 I decided I had to go it alone.
Looking back, this was the latest in a series of baffling decisions and I'm not sure my girlfriend will ever understand. But I knew, deep down, that my anger and anguish were not safe for her. I was close to suicidal.
Advocates of the bill made impassioned pleas to advance it past a filibuster, the rare proposal that drew the support of both GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Democratic Senate Intelligence Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein of California.
Usually, it is the media at the receiving end of a star's mood swings. A cameraman and a reporter with a leading portal went to meet Sonam Kapoor recently. After being made to wait a few hours for an audience, when she was finally ready to take questions, they noticed she was in a grumpy mood. Put off by their line of enquiry, she threatened to yank the tape off. She didn't quite do that, but did ask them to leave. The same crew was meted out similar treatment by Rani Mukerji, who behaved “as if the camera was not a camera but a gun”, in the words of the hapless reporter. “She behaved as if she owns Yash Raj Films—which she does, for all I care,” fumes the reporter. “But that still doesn't give her a reason to treat the press like that. First, [film artistes] cry to be famous. When they become famous, they want to hide from the cameras. What's the point?”
Prior to getting ground up in the “Shut The Door. Have A Seat” bloodbath, Paul Kinsey was Sterling Cooper's man of a thousand affectations. The beard, the pipe, the black girlfriend he showed off like an accessory—even in a world of stuffed shirts, Paul's had the least substance behind it. But he longed for substance, which explains how he'd wind up sucked into that ultimate net for lost souls of the '60s, the International Society For Krishna Consciousness. Simply dressing Michael Gladis in Hare Krishna garb is enough for a punchline in “Christmas Waltz,” but the bittersweet satire hiding among season five's more wicked surprises hones in on the person beneath the sikha, the guy who's still as anxious, insecure, and terrified of living life as he was when he dropped a Twilight Zone allusion into Peggy's first tour of the office. He's since moved on to Star Trek (and written a spec script to go with that new obsession), and is sent on the path to new writerly pretensions with a generous Christmas gift from Harry Crane, one of the pretenders who stayed behind while Paul sought enlightenment.

CALGARY — The Calgary Stampeders have re-signed national offensive lineman Dan Federkeil, the team announced Friday.
Federkeil previously played four seasons with the National Football League's Indianapolis Colts and is part of a select group of players with both Grey Cup and Super Bowl rings. He played five seasons with the Dinos and in 2005 was a finalist for the J.P. Metras Trophy as the top lineman in Canadian university football. Federkeil was a second-team Canadian university all-star in both 2003 and 2005.
In this lost gem, published in the early 1990s, the squirrel is portrayed as a demon figure who creates havoc and discord.

At a March 13 dinner at the Copper Door Restaurant in Bedford organized by New Hampshire GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn, Walker, a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, was asked how he would address the problem of roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States.
Next, we heard from JC Watts, the MC for the event – a black Congressman deliberately chosen for his skin color. Rand's campaign has been explicit from the beginning: their campaign will focus more on black votes than traditional Republicans.
The same process is underway to undermine women's voices in our own destiny. Mitt Romney has already flip-flopped from a pro-choice Senate candidate and a governor who promised to be “a good voice” among Republicans on reproductive health to his new incarnation as Paul Ryan's running mate and an anti-choice leader. While Ryan allows lesser candidates like Akin to carry the water on extreme views held by the right-wing patriarchy, his equally radical views become mainstreamed as his anti-woman credentials are embraced by the party leadership. If we don't stop laughing and start drawing hard lines around scientific reality, how many Akin's will it take before we see a President Romney ordering rape victims thrown into the water to see if they float?
The one that sticks out the most in my mind is when I was getting my “interviews” before I got married. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this process, when you are going to be married in the temple, you have to be completely worthy. Which in Mormon terms means a lot of things. I will post those questions momentarily. I got engaged to my boyfriend exactly 3 years ago from this coming Thursday. After we get engaged, we have to go through a series of interviews to determine whether we are worthy to be married in temple. We both are interviewed separately and then together. In my personal interview, the Bishop asks me if there is any major sin in my life that I haven't repented from.

Setoguchi added his second goal of the period 1:49 seconds later. With Dean McAmmond in the box for tripping, Sharks defenseman Rob Blake fired a shot from the point. The rebound came to the left circle, where Setoguchi beat Brodeur for the goal.
After a scoreless first period, Devils center Dainius Zubrus scored the first goal 11:13 to give the Devils the lead. Devils defenseman Colin White began the play by causing a turnover in his zone. He passed the puck to Ilya Kovalchuk, who skated the puck to the slot. He backhanded a pass to Patrik Elias, who put on a quick shot from the left circle. Nabakov made the save, but the puck trickled through his pads and laid on the crease. Zubrus crashed the net and pushed the puck in for his sixth goal of the season.
Mark Fraser extended the lead to two goals 35 seconds later. David Clarkson curled at the goal line and sent the puck to defenseman Anssi Salmela. Salmela passed the puck cross-ice to Fraser, who one-timed the shot. The puck deflected off of San Jose's Scott Nichol and beat Nabakov glove side.
Kovalchuk extended the lead to three with a powerplay goal late in the third. With Malholtra in the box for hooking, Zajac won the faceoff and passed it to Parise. Parise sent the puck to the point, and Kovalchuk skated to the center of the point. He sent a shot on net that deflected off of Sharks defenseman Rob Blake and into the net.
Last weekend's incident at the Nürburgring occurred when, following a pit stop, a wheel became detached from the Red Bull Racing car of Mark Webber as he made his way towards the pit lane exit. The loose wheel struck a television cameraman who was hospitalised as a result. He is expected to make a full recovery.
PHILADELPHIA — Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard has broken many records thus far throughout his 1,476-game Major League career.
Fugly had formerly been – alongside Nitr0 – the star player of Team Liquid, with all the skill and aim talent that Nitr0 had but being significantly more aware and present of catering to the team in his play. However following North American royalty Hiko joining Team Liquid , Fugly's play took a significant drop and his traditionally aggressive T-side play took a backseat to the rest of his teams roles . So when it was announced that Ukrainian superstar S1mple (more on that later) would join Liquid, Fugly was kicked and forced to look for another team. On the 20th of January he joined alongside the struggling CLG who had failed since their single map win in a Bo3 against Na`Vi at Dreamhack: Cluj-Napoca to take a map of a European side, they looked to make him – in combination with awper jdm64 and rifler Cutler – the primary fraggers of the team. CLG's first offline tournament with Fugly would be at the Global eSports Cup alongside their North American counterparts Cloud 9 and other mid-tier European sides. It was here that CLG would claim their first ever Bo3 LAN win over a top ten ranked European side (ex-Titan/G2) and also play a close series against EnVyUs in the group stage. Being the entry-man for CLG, Fugly played a crucial role in weakening bombsites and allowing his teammates Cutler and Jdm64 to finish out the round. Fugly and his team then preceded to qualify for MLG Columbus and then at Columbus itself, beat both the slumping Frenchmen EnVyUs and the hot-in-form Gambit in a Bo3. Unfortunately their run on home soil would be stopped by Fugly's former team and domestic rivals Team Liquid in the round-of-8. However, these two LAN showings combined with a consistent presence online, earned CLG a spot in the top ten and as best team in NA for admittedly a short period of time, but still was the highest peak that the CLG CS:GO team has ever reached. All this success can be attributed to their showings after Fugly joined at the start of the year.
TOPEKA, Kan. (KSNT) – Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) is back in Kansas after voting "yes" on the GOP's new tax plan.
Yup, the reality babe took part in the BBC Three show back in 2009 – and she looked like a totally different person. The raven-haired, extension loving pole dancer was spending her days on the beach in Ibiza back then, and we hardly recognise her. Charlie, then 24, announced that part of her reason for taking part on the show as for her boyfriend – who at the time wasn't Jason Burrill.
However, help is on the way, as the team give her a make-under. The look didn't stick forever though – and neither did her boyfriend – as now know she went on to find love with body double Jason before dying her hair blonde once again. Since appearing on the Channel 5 reality show, viewers have been keen to see how Charlie's desperate attempts to win Jason back will turn out.
I find this very disturbing. And not because I'm in the process of writing a book about Colonel Sanders. I don't expect anybody under 25 to read it  or anybody else, for that matter. But it hurts me as an American to think that so many people lack such a basic piece of cultural information. I mean, it's one thing to not know who Thomas Jefferson was or when the Vietnam War ended. College professors brace themselves for the ignorance of their charges and, in fact, have a good laugh about it every year, when two academics in Wisconsin circulate, with much fanfare, a list of how much the incoming freshmen don't know.
AFA Executive Vice-President Buddy Smith, and Director of Special Projects Randy Sharp, said they were rebuffed by Home Depot Chairman Frank Blake and other company executives for challenging their “corporate endorsement” of marriage equality and LGBT rights.

From Congresswoman Lois Capps, Chair of the Democratic Women's Working Group:
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today Congresswoman Lois Capps called on the Bush Administration to stop its misguided effort to restrict access to basic family planning services. According to press reports, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is drafting new rules that would severely restrict women's health care options while undermining the ability of health care providers to secure funding and provide essential services. It would require all recipients of federal health care funding to sign a written certification that they will not “discriminate” against health care entities who refuse to provide patients with abortions or even birth control. “Once again, the Bush Administration is carelessly playing partisan politics with women's health care,” said Capps, a nurse and Vice-Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health. “Time and again this Administration has jeopardized women's access to essential family planning services for purely ideological reasons. Sound science and responsible public health practices should never be trumped by political ideology. This proposal is unnecessary and would be harmful to women's health.” Federal law already protects individuals who prefer to not participate in abortion services and many states have refusal clauses for either individuals or institutions that object to providing or participating in abortions. The Bush Administration proposal goes far beyond those measures and attempts to define abortion services so broadly that it would include many types of birth control, including oral contraception and emergency contraception. Capps and several of her House colleagues will be sending a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services objecting to the draft rule and urging the Administration to reconsider its position. Capps has worked in the past to stop other efforts by the Bush Administration to restrict access to family planning services and contraception. She was part of the successful efforts to allow over-the-counter sales of Plan B emergency contraception and also to prevent attempts to restrict funding from certain health providers who provide comprehensive family planning services.
The investigation's findings came on the same day the US Marine Corps announced its punishment for three servicemen who took part in a video in which the bodies of dead Taliban fighters were urinated on.
Three servicemen pleaded guilty: one to "urinating on the body of a deceased Taliban soldier", another to posing for a photo with human casualties, and a third for lying to investigators.

In the past three Julys, Dombrowski has obtained Doug Fister, Anibal Sanchez and Jose Iglesias. Sanchez is leading the AL in ERA (and Detroit got second baseman Omar Infante in that trade, as well). Fister is in the top 20 in ERA. Iglesias was a bold move to solidify the infield after Jhonny Peralta was suspended 50 games for his involvement with Biogenesis.
(The Frisky) -- Last night, our own "Mind of Man" columnist was trying to tell me that couples moving in together was the kiss of death for their relationship. I think he's crazy -- always, always, always move in together before you commit to marriage, trust me! -- but it did get me thinking about what some real kiss of death moments are for couples. Just don't be mad at us if you decide to dump your boyfriend as a result.
"After my boyfriend and I broke up is when I finally bought new bras and undies," admits Sarah. "I didn't care about maintaining any sort of sex appeal for him, but all the new guys on the horizon? Hell, yeah."
"When my boyfriend would call up his mother and ask her for her advice on work, money matters, and, seriously, even what to wear to Easter brunch, I realized he was never going to value my opinion as much or more than hers," says Lisa.
During the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the United States Men's Hockey Team wore dog tags inscribed with the words "In Memory of Brendan Burke".[9][10] In June 2010, Chicago Blackhawks president John McDonough announced that he would be sending the team's recently won Stanley Cup with defenseman Brent Sopel who would march in the 2010 Chicago Gay Pride Parade. Sopel began his NHL career with Vancouver and became friends with Brian Burke when he was the general manager there. Although he was traded to Atlanta earlier in the week, Sopel honored Brendan Burke by using his day with the Stanley Cup to display it in the Chicago Gay Pride Parade,[29] stating to the press that honoring Burke's legacy and his father's example of familial support and tolerance was one of his reasons for marching in the parade.[30] In recognition of the one-year anniversary of Burke's death, the Blackhawks wore special sweaters during their weekend game on February 5, 2011.[12]
During the trial, Ruetten testified he casually dated Lazarus after college, but he never considered her a girlfriend and dated other women while seeing her. Lazarus eventually married a Los Angeles Police detective and the couple adopted a daughter.
Despite the furor over net neutrality after President Obama was elected, the 2010 Open Internet rules ultimately adopted by former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Julius Genachowski in part mirrored our "Third Way" recommendations: Ensuring transparency in broadband operators' network management, imposing strong rule against blocking of legal content, while still allowing at least some flexibility for reasonable network management.
Last January, the District of Columbia Circuit Court overruled some parts of those rules, and now current FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler finds himself with the difficult job of threading the needle for a reasonable, third-way approach. Wheeler is currently trapped between two bad options: one flawed, the other terrible. The flawed option, pushed by many conservatives, is to have the FCC do nothing. This approach is not as unreasonable as it may seem. There is only one case of actual abuse (the Madison River case), all major network operators have committed to not blocking or degrading traffic, and there is no indication network operators desire discriminatory deals. Moreover, the alarming neutrality violations imagined by those on the left would likely be deterred by the potential PR firestorm and could be stopped by the FTC under current authority.
For some, the call will be for the global powers to finally put an end to al-Assad or to help the people of Syria do it themselves, in a fashion similar to Libya and the downfall of late strongman Moammar Gadhafi.

CARSON becomes the fourth Arizona State player to earn Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, and first since 2003, joining Byron Scott (1980), Jamal Faulkner (1991), and Ike Diogu (2003). Carson has logged more minutes than any other player this season, averaging 37.0 minutes per game. He's among the league's top five in scoring and assists, currently averaging 17.7 points per game (4th in the Pac-12) and 5.0 assists per game (3rd in the Pac-12). He's posted 14 20-point games this season, tied for most in the league with Pac-12 Player of the Year Allen Crabbe.
MUHAMMAD becomes the eighth UCLA player to earn Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, and first since 2008, joining Pooh Richardson (1986), Don MacLean (1989), Baron Davis (1998) Jason Kapono (2000), Jordan Farmar (2005), Luc Richard Mbah a Moute (2006), and Kevin Love (2008). Muhammad was a key piece all season for Pac-12 regular season champion UCLA, leading the Bruins in scoring (18.3 ppg/3rd in Pac-12) and three-point field goal percentage (.417/3rd in Pac-12), and was second in assists (3.7 apg/8th in Pac-12). He posted 13 20-point games this season and added three double-doubles. Muhammad was one of only two freshmen (also teammate Kyle Anderson) to be named Player of the Week this season, earning the honor following a 27-point effort in a win over Missouri.

At the beginning of day three of the third Test of India's 2017 tour, Sri Lanka were 19 for 1 following on, still 333 runs behind. No senior batsmen rallied. No one hit a hundred to salvage a little pride, let alone save the game.
And in Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lanka had a leader with a finger on the pulse of virtually every match, a constant ear to the ground, and an innate sense of when the moment lay waiting to be seized. He prodded opposition batsmen into awkward corners, he had his bowlers take top orders by the collar, he lay traps, he played mind games, and his team won 2-1. Additionally, his mastery of the DRS system in that series helped turn a generation of India players against the idea.
Fairly or not, Park's remarks and proposal to ban masks are sure to give further ammo to critics who have long accused her of authoritarian and even fascist tendencies.

Witnesses testified during the more than two-week trial that the abuse of Williams, who was 17 at the time, included the two bike-lock incidents, calling him nicknames referring to America's history of slavery, writing a form of the “n” word on a whiteboard and displaying the Confederate flag. Attorneys for the defendants, who were all San Jose State freshmen at the time of the episode, argued that their clients simply took a “prank war” too far because they were “immature, insensitive and stupid.”

Florida Congressman and Tea Party darling Allen West is no stranger to idiotic crap. His 22-year military career ended when he couldn't resist torturing an Iraqi detainee, and once he was elected to the House, he wasted no time in establishing himself as one of this great nation's foremost asshats. He's a wild-eyed Bachmannesque Islamophobe who once called Congresswoman and Jezebel homegirl Debbie Wasserman Schultz "not a lady" and then lied about apologizing to her. So, this latest round of idiocy isn't necessarily a surprise, although it is totally gross. Apparently while he was in the Army, he wrote his wife a letter demanding she wear only two piece swimsuits and be "(his) porn star."
I'm sorry I didn't post sooner I was waiting for the second package, and boy was it worth the wait!! The first one was a very cool triangle box from the Reddit marketplace that had a Snoo figurine(which goes perfect with our Pop figures) and a Snoo shirt which I love!! Those were wrapped in a super cute cat cloth piece which can be sewn into an adorable two sides cat!! That was held together with a rad magnetized Snoo clip!! The second gift was even more perfect! It is an adorable cat bank!! I have wanted one of these SOOO bad! I cannot wait to put tons of change in it!! Even my boyfriend got a huge kick out of it! Bravo Santa you did an astounding job! <3

Contrary to popular belief, however, politics is not all doom and gloom and buffoon these days. Scott Taylor, a first-term Republican congressman out of the great state of Virginia, has introduced his first piece of sponsored legislation, a bill that would amend the Fair Housing Act to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in housing. I am pleased to inform you that there is no sarcastic punchline. Congressman Taylor apparently just wants those in the LGBT community to be able to rent an apartment or buy a house without being turned away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Here, look for yourself.
The Niners may own the decade, but the Chicago Bears Super Bowl victory might be the most memorable of all. The team's dominance of the New England Patriots in a 46-10 win in Super Bowl XX was just the tip of an iceberg that also included the unforgettable touchdown run by defensive lineman William "Refridgerator" Perry and the subsequent Super Bowl Shuffle.
TUSCALOOSA, Alabama -- Long before Alabama's Trent Richardson took a screen pass 61 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter, Alabama had all it needed to beat the Arkansas Razorbacks. Touchdowns on a trick play, an interception and a punt return were more than enough to hold off the Hogs in a game that wasn't as close as the 38-14 final score. Alabama simply dominated. They were the best Saturday and maybe every Saturday for weeks to come. The Crimson Tide were better than the Hogs on offense, defense and special teams. They controlled the line of scrimmage and the Razorbacks from start to finish. Yes, the Razorbacks played hard and never gave up, but without a semblance of a running game they were as predictable as Saturday's weather forecast. It was almost as if the Crimson Tide were eavesdropping in the huddle; oh yeah, the Hogs didn't huddle much and Bama, which practices against the no huddle every day, was ready for anything and everything. Bobby Petrino was so desperate for some yards on the ground he called a reverse to Joe Adams from his 20. Without so much as a blink, Alabama smothered the play for a loss of 7 yards. At the half, the Hogs had minus-6 yards rushing and 89 yards total. Bama had 96 yards rushing and 114 through the air. That's balance, which obviously you can't have if you don't have a running game. A little of the blame falls on Ronnie Wingo, who had a 26-yard touchdown run called back because an offensive lineman held, and some on the offensive line. Credit Alabama's D the most. It didn't help the Hogs that starting defensive end Jake Bequette was out with a hamstring injury and that in the first series. they lost the other starting defensive end Tank Wright (and we won't even bring up running back Knile Davis), but that didn't cost them the game. What hurt the Hogs most was Alabama. This Crimson Tide defense looked better than the one two years ago when Alabama won here 35-7. That year, Alabama went undefeated and won the BCS national championship. Mark Ingram won the Heisman Trophy that year, too. Richardson should be a strong candidate for that honor before this season is over. He's harder to tackle than an out-of- control freight train on a mile-long downhill run. It is easier to get a hand on a full-speed bowling ball than Richardson. He's quick and fast enough to drive your car before you know your keys are gone. He gives all new meaning to Roll Tide Roll. He and Eddie Lacy are why Alabama has balance on offense. And the Crimson Tide defense is the backbone of this team. The past 10 times the No. 1 SEC offense met the No. 1 defense, the offense won eight times. On Saturday, there was not a threat of that becoming nine times. Tyler Wilson probably needs industrial strength Tylenol today he was pounded so hard, and too often, by a Bama defender. Tide defenders locked down receivers like it was midnight at the Tuscaloosa County Jail. It was Bobby Petrino's worst loss since his first season when the Hogs fell to Texas 52-10 and Alabama 49-14 a week earlier. This was not play-calling or preparation though. It was a lack of execution and much of that was because the Crimson Tide were so dominating. They dictated the outcome of the majority of the plays. Saturday, Arkansas played a team that very well could play for another BCS national championship at the end of this season. Alabama looked that good from start to finish.

The Trump White House is far too chaotic, riven by infighting and buffeted by the impulses of the president, to have clear doctrines about democracy promotion, or many other weighty questions of geopolitics, says a senior administration official. A position may earn signs of support from Mr Trump, but “you can take that to the bank for as long as you are talking to him”, says the official—before a presidential tweet says the opposite minutes later. Mr Hun Sen's blunder, the official says, was to project his own absolutism onto America. “He seems to think that now we have this rich old guy in charge of the United States, [Mr Trump] can snap his fingers and everything will change.” American government is messier than that. With a small country like Cambodia, policy remains broadly set by career foreign service officers (among them the American ambassador), by staff in the National Security Council and by members of Congress sincerely aggrieved by Mr Hun Sen's assaults on democracy and news outlets. That group includes Mr McCain and his Republican colleagues Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Congressman Ed Royce of California, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Mr Orban is proud of being the first European leader to endorse Mr Trump, says the Hungarian ambassador to Washington, Laszlo Szabo. It is “very obvious” that the two leaders share similar views on defending their countries from illegal immigrants, a term which the ambassador uses to cover the vast majority of those who reached Europe during the refugee crisis of 2015. They also agree on the public's yearning for strong, sovereign governments that stand up for their national interests with what Mr Szabo calls a “healthy self-consciousness”. In April the Hungarian parliament amended a higher-education law in a way that threatened to close down the Central European University (CEU), a graduate institute founded by the Hungarian-American billionaire, George Soros, a bogeyman to conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. In June Hungary passed a law restricting foreign funding for civil-society groups, again singling out Mr Soros, and triggering legal action by the European Commission in Brussels, which believes the measure may breach EU fundamental rights. If Mr Orban expected to be thanked by the Trump administration or Republicans in Congress for this assault on Mr Soros, he was disappointed.
A third and final case study involves Egypt, a large, important and problematic ally whose strongman leader, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, has not found the new administration as easy to handle as he seemed to expect. Few modern presidents have pressed Egypt hard on human rights, placing greater emphasis on the stability of the most populous Arab country, and on co-operation with the Egyptian military, intelligence and counter-terrorist services. Relations have been sweetened with tens of billions of dollars in American aid since 1948, much of it to buy weapons.

I had gone my entire life thinking that the best beef was the domain of the United States. How wrong I was.

Mussels can become stressed by increases in acidity Man-made pollution is raising ocean acidity at least 10 times faster than previously thought, a study says. Researchers say carbon dioxide levels are having a marked effect on the health of shellfish such as mussels. They sampled coastal waters off the north-west Pacific coast of the US every half-hour for eight years. The results, published in the journal PNAS, suggest that earlier climate change models may have underestimated the rate of ocean acidification. Ocean pH Professor Timothy Wootton from the department of ecology and evolution, University of Chicago, in Illinois, says such dramatic results were unexpected as it was thought that the huge ocean systems had the ability to absorb large quantities of CO2. "It's been thought pH in the open oceans is well buffered, so it's surprising to see these fluctuations," he said. The findings showed that CO2 had lowered the water pH over time, demonstrating a year-on-year increase in acidity. Increasing quantities of dissolved CO2 will make seawater more acidic The research involved taking daily measurements of water pH levels, salinity and temperature, off the coast of Tatoosh island, a small outcrop lying in the Pacific Ocean, just off the north-western tip of Washington state, US. As well as measuring physical factors, the health of marine life present in the coastal ecosystem was also tracked. Professor Wootton says biological factors were missing from previous models of ocean climate systems - and that life in the ocean, or in this case on the ocean edge, can also affect seawater pH. "Over a short time, biology is affecting pH, through photosynthesis and respiration, but current models don't include biological activity as part of the story," he explained. Calcium carbonate Every summer, Professor Wootton returned to the same sites on Tatoosh island's windswept coasts, to look at the abundance and distribution of life at the water's edge. He was especially interested in barnacles, algae and the dominant species, the Californian mussel. Seawater sampling was conducted for eight years The mussel has a calcium carbonate -based shell, which can be weakened or even dissolved by exposure to acid. Professor Wootton says the increase in acidity may be responsible for the decline in mussels noted in the study. "Patterns show the chances of mussels being replaced are higher than for species without calcified shells," he said. Other species quickly move into the space previously occupied by the mussels - though one of these species, the barnacle, also has calcified shells. To explain this apparent anomaly, Professor Wootton says the decline of the dominant species allows a window where another species may thrive - though he expects this to be temporary as the interloper too will eventually be affected by the increasing acidity. "In the short term, the long term decline is offset by the release from competition," he explained.
Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen says Monday's auction for the Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition was "another slap in Test cricket's face".
Routledge made her professional stage debut at the Liverpool Playhouse in 1952 and her Broadway debut in How's the World Treating You in 1966. She won the 1968 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in Darling of the Day, and the 1988 Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical for Candide.
On television, she came to prominence during the 1980s in monologues written by Alan Bennett and Victoria Wood; appearing in Bennett's A Woman of No Importance (1982), as Kitty in Victoria Wood as Seen on TV (1985–1986), and being nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for Bennett's Talking Heads: A Lady of Letters (1988). She also starred as Hetty Wainthropp in the British television series Hetty Wainthropp Investigates (1989, 1996–1998).
Routledge has had a prolific career in theatre, particularly musical theatre, in the United Kingdom and the United States. Her vocal range was labelled as a mezzo-soprano and a contralto. She has been a long-standing member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), appearing in such acclaimed productions as the 1983 Richard III, which starred Antony Sher in the title role.[9][10] Her West End credits include Little Mary Sunshine,[11] Cowardy Custard,[12] Virtue in Danger,[13] Noises Off,[14] The Importance of Being Earnest,[15] and The Solid Gold Cadillac,[16] as well as a number of less successful vehicles. She was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her work in And a Nightingale Sang in 1979. A classically trained singer,[17] she has occasionally made forays into operetta including taking the title role in an acclaimed production of Jacques Offenbach's La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein at the 1978 Camden Festival; "As the Grand Duchess she invested every phrase, spoken or sung [...] with wit and meaning, and coloured her tone to express a wide variety of emotions. Never did she resort to the hoydenish behaviour that this role — in British productions at least — seems to invite."[18]
Routledge's early television appearances included a role in Steptoe and Son, in the episode "Seance in a Wet Rag and Bone Yard" (1974), as a clairvoyant called Madame Fontana. She also appeared in Coronation Street,[35] and as a white witch in Doctor at Large (1971). Also in 1971, Routledge played Mrs. Jennings in the BBC mini-series production of Sense and Sensibility. However, she did not come to prominence on television until she featured in monologues written for her by Alan Bennett and later Victoria Wood in the 1980s. She first appeared in Alan Bennett's A Woman of No Importance in 1982, and then as the opinionated Kitty in Victoria Wood as Seen on TV in 1985. She performed two further monologues in Bennett's Talking Heads in 1987 and 1998. Routledge was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Actress for the monologue "A Lady of Letters".
It is this staff that certain Transformers in the present day want. But the breastplate finds itself affixed, by the forces of destiny, to the ripped and buff body of Cade, who is to be humanity's hero. Certain British academics and aristocrats are aware of the Transformers link with English legend, notably Sir Edmund Burton, played by Anthony Hopkins, a charismatic nobleman who in some occult sense is keeper of the ultimate secret. Then there is the brilliant young Oxford historian with the picturesque name of Vivian Wembley, played by Laura Haddock and, for all her academic qualifications, made to conform to Bay's old-school views of femininity. She is, of course, to have a romantic spark with Cade.
As for the hedge animals vs. the hedge maze, that's a bit of a toss-up. The hedge maze is merely a set piece that offers an almost convenient resolution to Jack's threat at the end, though it made for some great suspense. The hedge animals were a special effect that just wouldn't work on film. For their first couple of appearances in the novel, they only move when the characters aren't looking at them, and to King's credit, he writes the scenes very well, ramping up the tension, as the animals are so spread out the characters can't look at all of them at once. Unfortunately, at the end, the animals come completely to life and attack en masse, whether the characters are looking at them or not. No matter how King tried to describe them, my mind's eye could not picture “evil man-eating bushes” as anything other than silly. The miniseries adaptation of The Shining, though I haven't seen it in years, I don't recall doing a very good job of realizing the hedge animals, either. So as a concession, I was satisfied with the hedge maze.
Nearly two years after producing its first kegs, Big Bend Brewing Company has quadrupled production. The July event, billed as the Bigger Better Brewery Bash, celebrated the unveiling of the expansion. Local residents and tourists wandered through the brewing space, examining the giant stainless steel fermentation tanks. Outside, a dust devil whipped through the seating area, sending a visitor's cowboy hat skyrocketing into the air and reminding attendees that they were still in West Texas.
The ongoing economic crisis in Venezuela has hit the once-thriving fishing industry in Sucre particularly hard, pushing local fisherman to turn to illicit activities for sustenance, according to Associated Press.
The media outlet said pirates target local fishermen to rob them of their netted fish or the boat's motor — the latter item being particularly valuable for drug traffickers looking to increase the horsepower of their vessels.
Moreover, the economic hardship seems to be encouraging many to become involved in other illicit activities like drug trafficking and human smuggling as opportunities for legal work dry up. These trends are illustrated by recent press reports from El Estimulo, which quoted a local fisherman admitting that “at least 80 percent of the inhabitants of [San Juan de las Galdonas, a coastal town in Sucre] are involved in” drug trafficking, and the New York Times, which reported on an increase in human smuggling on the Caribbean coast as thousands of Venezuelans attempt to escape their country's devolving economic situation.

Mulligan went undrafted in 2008, but has been an NFL journeyman since, landing on 11 different teams in just nine years. That experience gives him a huge edge over the other four healthy tight ends on the roster, three of which are undrafted rookies. At this point in time, Mulligan seems like the 1B to Wick's 1A.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said this and other releases by Obama's administration are dangerous, claiming many nations that receive former detainees aren't up for the job and that these countries don't stop them from rejoining the fight.
Do you have a girlfriend who enjoys buying more than she can afford and has trouble making ends meet by the end of the month? If she asks you for help, you can help her by allowing her figure it out on her own. She just might decide against repeating her mistake the next month. Of course she might elect to remain irresponsible and move on to a less motivating man, but you'll have a little more money in your pocket.
"It is important, as we have discussed with Chairman Smith and task force leaders, that they continue to work on a parallel track and in concert with UAB Football Foundation leaders to raise private funding needed to reinstate football, rifle and bowling," Ryan said. "This aspect of the effort is critical and time sensitive, given our ongoing discussions with Conference USA."
“We have a lot of people who feel very strongly about what the future (of the neighborhood) looks like,” neighborhood Chairman R. Paul Evans said Monday. “They'd like to see their dreams pursued, and are not happy that David Hall's singular dream seems to be impacting all of us.”

Congress insiders promise the next stage in the Rahul and party campaign will be more focused in its messaging and tailored to specific target groups. Meanwhile, Brand Rahul seems to be stuck in a vortex of legacy, what he wants to be, and what his party and spin doctors want him to be. The evolution of a definitive brand, it seems, may be a tad late in the making for this general elections. "Rahul Gandhi is a product that is making a claim that I am in R&D mode," says Sunil Alagh, Chairman of SKA Advisors. "Modi is a chai-biscoot man, part of our daily life. Rahul Gandhi is a chocolate biscuit brand - and I don't need chocolate today."
The park has an area for dogs and amenities like a picnic area and demonstration garden for people. Arlington County Board Chairman Walter Tejada helped cut the ribbon on the $1.6 million park, located at the corner of N. Herndon and 13th Streets.

The army used to train its soldiers in staffing a jail as a matter of routine during the 1980s and 1990s but withdrew from the agreement 10 years ago in the face of the pressures of Iraq and other campaigns. The prisons minister, Crispin Blunt, a former army captain, got MoD approval a few months ago for up to 3,000 servicemen and women to be trained in prison craft such as how to lock down a wing, moving inmates around the prison safely, and understanding fire risks.
The Democratic National Convention also injected itself into the interparty fight. Spokesman Mark Paustenbach wrote in a statement, "Wow, that didn't take long. Cruz and Kasich's desperate attempt to stay relevant – despite the fact they mathematically have no chance of winning the nomination without plunging their party into further chaos – has already fallen apart. The GOP is still in denial. Trump hasn't taken over the party— their leadership over the years has promoted the divisive policies that allowed Trump to flourish.”
Earlier this week, NBADraft.net did a college prospect analysis of the players at adidas Nations, which was a month ago. Kansas freshmen Wayne Selden and Joel Embiid both received high praise from NBADraft.net. Sophomore Perry Ellis also performed well.
Freeleanord.com, states that on 26 June 1975, two FBI agents, Jack Coler and Ronald Williams, used an unmarked car to follow a pick-up truck onto the Jumping Bull ranch. The agents were reportedly following a Native American teenager, a member of AIM, who was accused of stealing a pair of cowboy boots after a fight off the reservation. The shootout took place near an abandoned farm house.
11. None of the major networks–ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN–has an ombudsman. This is mystifying to me. They don't seem to realize that since the rise of the Internet, their reporting is called into question far more easily and far more effectively. This case was especially likely to blow-up in ABC's face once Jake Tapper's report appeared online. When one reporter pisses on another reporter's scoop, the first reporter enters a danger zone. The overwhelming temptation is to defend the story and treat the critique of it by another reporter as professional jealousy. A wise editor would intervene. (Attention: Rick Klein.) That did not happen. When the newsroom hierarchy fails, as it did here, the ombudsman can step in and force an accounting. But there is no ombudsman at ABC.
With the trade deadline looming, the Habs could use a top-six centre to improve their offence and bolster their forward corps. While Bergevin stated yesterday that elite centremen simply weren't available, Matt Duchene is one candidate widely reported to be on the market who could give the team a more dynamic makeup down the middle.
"For me, Elizabeth's craftsmanship is kind of unparalleled. I don't know anyone's work that consistently stays so rich and rigorous over such a long period of time," she says. "I've always looked to her work for that inspiration."
Auto-tuned beardo Justin Vernon might give the appearance of a loafer, but you'd be surprised: In between recent collaborations with Kanye West, Alicia Keys, and songwriter Kathleen Edwards, the Bon Iver frontman miraculously found time to reconvene with his other, other side project, Volcano Choir, his group with Wisconsin sound-collagists Collections of Colonies of Bees. The group's second album, Repaveanother gorgeous swirl of droning, falsetto-fueled post-rockis out on September 3.
“We recognize countries' sovereign decisions to limit or amplify their own refugee programs, but given the truly grave insecurity in which a significant part of the Salvadoran population lives, of course these decisions concern us greatly,” said Gerardo Alegría, assistant ombudsman for migration and citizen security in the office of the Human Rights Ombudsman of El Salvador. “Emigration from our country is forced, and what people need is the chance to find safety in other countries.”
So here's what I think about Steve Mason: he's just fine. He's a serviceable, above-average NHL starting goaltender. He came to this city four years ago and, for those four years, he did his job. Was it done exceptionally? At times, sure. However, there were just as many times that he couldn't get out of his own way. Ultimately, it doesn't matter anymore what I think of Mason because he is in Winnipeg (and looking every bit the stopgap starter he would have been had he stayed here), while Connor Hellebuyck prepares for the day he takes over the Jets' crease long term. I was admittedly not as upset as some were when it became clear during the NHL free agency period that Mason wasn't coming back. He needed a change of scenery, and his contract demands would have been too much for a team that's in “win eventually” mode, like the predicament that Philadelphia finds themselves in. Regardless of how you feel about Steve Mason, it's time to look ahead to next season and the Flyers debut of Brian Elliott, a 6'3″ journeyman who should make at least half the starts in goal for the Flyers next season. Elliott signed in Philly to mixed reception, but the most important news is that he is signed for 2 years at an AAV of $2.75M, versus the 2 years at $4.1M per Mason was tendered to in Winnipeg. For Flyers fans that wept when they heard of Mason's departure, what can they look forward to in Brian Elliott?
After O'Donnell took Trump to task in 2006 for defending Miss USA Tara Conner, Trump began publicly referring to O'Donnell as a “fat pig” and “animal.” He also spewed an outrageous two-minute rant against O'Donnell to Entertainment Tonight: “Rosie O'Donnell is disgusting—both inside and out. If you take a look at her, she's a slob. How does she even get on television?... If I were running The View, I'd fire Rosie. I'd look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers and say, ‘Rosie, you're fired.' We're all a little chubby but Rosie's just worse than most of us. But it's not the chubbiness—Rosie is a very unattractive person, both inside and out. Rosie's a person that's very lucky to have her girlfriend and better be careful or I'll send one of my friends over to pick up her girlfriend. Why would she stay with Rosie if she had another choice?”
Warplanes from the U.S.-led coalition have dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Islamic State positions in Iraq and Syria since August. Combined with attacks by Iraqi government forces, Kurdish fighters and Sunni Arab tribesmen who oppose the Islamist group, the campaign has stopped the militants from seizing much new territory and pushed them back in several areas.
Prosecutor Brian Fitzherbert said that when Medcalf saw his girlfriend calling the police after he had attacked an acquaintance's car in Torquay, he fired the BB gun at her, which cracked a window.

While Trump has claimed real and possibly imagined intimacies with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, Trudeau has boasted of very real “family” ties with the Castro regime in Cuba and with Xi Jinping's regime in Beijing.

After some interesting photos, both official and exhibition pictures, Good Smile Company released today an official preview for their Nendoroid of Elsa from Frozen. Disney's Arendelle Royal Family's eldest daughter Elsa comes with the funny enchanted snowman Olaf and with three expressions, including a smiling face, a smirking expression and a singing one.
Her elegant, light blue dress has been sculpted to perfectly resemble the one from the movie, with the top part and the cape covered with shiny glitters. Elsa's cape is decorated with a lovely snowflake pattern, and Olaf also comes with articulated neck and arms, so to have the ability to recreate funny scenes with enchanted snowman as well. Included with the Nendoroid figure there also is a special base based on Elsa's ice castle.

Yesterday, committee Chairman Dave Camp issued a press release, coming within inches of directly accusing the agency of obstruction of justice (HT Rare via TaxProf):
Camp, Levin press IRS for more documents Top tax writers in the House are pressing the IRS over what they're calling the slow delivery of documents on the current targeting controversy. Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) and the panel's top Democrat, Rep. Sandy Levin, noted in a Wednesday letter that the committee had received about 13,000 pages of documents for its investigation, more than two months after its first request. The IRS had said back in June that it had collected some 65 million pages worth of documents, leading Camp and Levin to ask Wednesday what the agency was doing to expedite the committee's request. “We are concerned that, at this rate, the full production will take months,” Camp and Levin wrote to Danny Werfel, the interim IRS leader.

Becky Walker, an EBCI tribal member from the Wolfetown Community, commented after the vote, “It was really disappointing to know that one of the leaders of our Tribe had gone and participated with the Redskins and actually did a promotional video in support of them, and basically, in the way that it appears, used our servicemen as a front and a guise to do that. I am glad that this issue was addressed today, and I hope that we can really find out exactly what happened, what was exchanged and what our Tribe received in relation to Principal Chief Michell Hicks' dealings with the Washington NFL team.”

3. COMMITMENT TO QUALITY: In March 1995, Samsung's Chairman Lee Kun Hee was not content with the quality of Samsung products. In order to get his employees to better understand the importance of quality, he had his staff assemble a pile of 150,000 phones and fax machines in a field outside the Gumi factory in South Korea. More than 2,000 employees gathered to watch the destruction of the old devices, ushering in a new era centered around product quality. Ever since that day, we have focused on creating high-quality premium products that have gained critical and commercial success globally.

Young people have reached out to me, and they tend to be 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds who really believe that the whole Gamergate thing is against bullying and about ensuring that video games are ethical. It's really hard to help young people who genuinely believe the thing they love is being massively attacked. Which it's not. [I want] to help them understand and believe that they are just people manipulated and used by people with a very, very clear agenda. This misogynist, anti-woman agenda existed long before Adam Baldwin called it “Gamergate,” which is kind of ridiculous because putting anything like this on par with Watergate is just stupid and juvenile. Those efforts are going to continue.
V. Scott Vanis, the Chairman and Managing Director of the Company said, "We have been diligently working towards this type of traditional credit facility for a long time. Our work has finally paid off. This $2,000,000 Credit Line will allow the Company to make business decisions without the distractions caused by less traditional financing vehicles. The fact that we do not have any payments due while we launch VitaminFIZZ® and expand COFFEE BOOST™ is only trumped by the fact that we do not have any conversions to worry about. I would like to thank Post Oak and their team for their confidence in our companies! We have earned this by operating our business in a responsible manner, and we will continue to do so. Only now we have added increased 'flexibility' and 'freedom' to our business operations. We look forward to a long relationship with Post Oak as we continue to set and attain our lofty goals."

Recent excavations have given us a picture of a wealthy monastery at its heart. Scriptures were copied on to carefully prepared animal skin parchment by monks, skilled craftsmen created beautiful, jewel-encrusted religious ornaments, sculptors carved intricate Celtic crosses.

Balotelli believes City's stunning win at Old Trafford, which has put them five points clear at the top of the Premier League, proves they "can be the best" and he has thanked the City fans for their backing of the players and, in particular, himself.

The statement also acknowledged press representatives who were subjected to the police violence during demonstrations. Bülent Ünal, a cameraman from Ulusal Kanal who were hit in the head during the protests, told bianet that even though activists showed no intentions to use violence during their protest, police acted as if “they were facing an enemy”.

In the morning hours of April 10, 1986, H.Amdt.777 Amendment passed the House by voice vote, and the House held recorded votes on three amendments to FOPA in Record Vote No's 72, 73, and 74. Recorded Vote 72 was on H.AMDT. 776, an amendment to H.AMDT 770 involving the interstate sale of handguns; while Recorded Vote 74 was on H.AMDT 770, involving primarily the easing of interstate sales and the safe passage provision. Recorded Vote 74 was the Hughes Amendment that called for the banning of machine guns. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), at the time presiding as Chairman over the proceedings, claimed that the "amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to." However, after the voice vote on the Hughes Amendment, Rangel ignored a plea to take a recorded vote and moved on to Recorded Vote 74.[9][10][11] The bill, H.R. 4332, as a whole passed in Record Vote No: 75 on a motion to recommit. Despite the controversial amendment, the Senate, in S.B. 49, adopted H.R. 4332 as an amendment to the final bill. The bill was subsequently passed and signed on May 19, 1986 by President Ronald Reagan to become Public Law 99-308, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act.

Hello again (again). So something interesting came up in this thread: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/HALQfHsu-marvelous-portrait-of-taric-on-surfer-singeds-updated-textures Namely, a discussion around hair. Yes. Hair. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_zaSKZks1A Bur seriously, there's a thought swimming in my head about slanting Taric a little more "modern". Even the term "metrosexual" came up, mainly referring to a well-kempt, good looking gentleman that's fashionable and, for lack of a better term, "modern". Some of my explorations lean this way. I'll emphasize **explorations** as this is super early concept stuff. In part II of this discussion.. http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/a7ulBkBM-so-what-do-you-guys-wanna-do-with-taric-part-ii-pics-or-it-didnt-happen ..we talked about visual reference, asking what people were looking for in our favorite gem knight. A lot of fancy paladin art came up, sort of standard fantasy fair. The traditional suit of armor that's nicely ornamented and beautiful. But, it begs a question. What can separate Taric out from a standard paladin? One idea that's been floated in giving him that "modern" twist I mentioned. What does this mean? Well, it can mean a lot of things. One thing is his hair. Hair often can define modernity and current fashion trends. The way I perceive it is that the poof that Taric sorta has now dates him quite a bit. The suggestion was made to give him more of a modern cut, and therefore, give him more relatable, and current, style. I'm wondering that maybe we don't stop there. Maybe we push him to feel "modern" and fashionable all over. I'm not talking about futuristic, or runway high-fashion, but I'm wondering if it'd be a valuable exercise to ask for ideas about what people think a "Modern Paladin" could look like. Maybe supply some images that stress Taric's beauty and charm, but also set him apart from sword-and-sorcery fantasy. Not that that sort of fantasy is bad, but I'm looking to see what sort of spin we might be able to put on Taric that isn't just an armor set. I think exploring fashion, modern trends, and more contemporary looks might yield some results. What do you think?
The Preds Won't Really Draft a Defenseman at #4, Will They?
If I had to guess, I'd say the Predators take either Barkov or Lindholm at #4, either one of which would help address the biggest hole in the organization, a long-term center for either of the top two lines. Mike Fisher & David Legwand are passable options in those roles, but in 2-4 years? Probably not so much. Nichushkin may set the fanboys on fire with his highlight-reel potential, but
Only after a Bush press spokesman brazenly insisted there was "no evidence" the 473 day gap existed, did Congressman Henry Waxman, the Bush gang's worst nightmare, release the study.
One also sees that God has given men a special insight into His relationship to the creation, by virtue of our intermediary position as male creatures; we have something of the ruler and something of the subject within ourselves. Our experience as the masters of womankind gives us some insight into God's experience with all of us; our experience as subjects of God gives us insight into a woman's subordination (and, often enough, inconstancy).

Carrier came to the Colonels from the AAU ranks, where he played for the Phillips 66 team, which gave its players 20 gallons of gas for every three-pointer. “I told Louie I never had to pay for gas,” the marksman says. “But I split it with my teammates.” Carrier spent five years with the Colonels, leaving after the '71-72 season for Memphis, before a torn Achilles ended his career.
Five-star defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, five-star outside linebacker Lyndell “Mack” Wilson, five-star wide receiver Nate Craig-Meyers and four-star wide receivers Binjimen Victor and Tre Nixon are among the recruits believed to be considering Florida as their college destinations. The Gators could also attempt to “flip” the commitments of several other prospects, such as Auburn wide receiver pledge Elijah Stove and Miami wide receiver pledge Sam Bruce.
Even if Florida can't convince an elite signal-caller to join its 2016 class, it already has a four-star quarterback lined up for '17 in St. Thomas Aquinas's Jake Allen. So while McElwain may not reel in a skilled triggerman for his offense this February, there is no shortage of talent in the pipeline.

“Face the Nation” Host John Dickerson quickly turned the conversation to the Russia investigation, prompting yet another revealing, but ultimately unsurprising, admission from the longtime California senator. Namely, that the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign has yet to find evidence. Though she later insinuated that Chairman Richard Burr – who delivered a memorable status update last week – and his fellow Republicans have been trying to undermine the investigation, without elaborating as to how. She added that proof will "likely" be uncovered by the Mueller investigation which has grand jury power... although if that were the case, one would expect it to have been leaked by now.
JOHN DICKERSON: Let me switch here to another topic for you, which is the Senate Intelligence Committee work that you've been doing. Chairman Burr of that committee said that the question of collusion between the Russians trying to influence the election and the Trump campaign was still an open question. Is that because there are more disclosures that suggest it's a possibility, or just because nothing's been found yet, and it's an open question because there's no proof that it's happened? DIANNE FEINSTEIN: I think the latter. It's an open question because there's no proof yet that it's happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller's investigation. He's got the ability to use a grand jury. He's got the ability to use the power of subpoena without question. And he's got the ability to do a criminal investigation. And that's what's going on, and I think that's where the information will come. What happens in a political body, and I am finding this as the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, everything has to be negotiated with the party in power, and it's very difficult to do an investigation under those circumstances.
Mr James went to America to spend three months with his girlfriend before the pair married in 2006.
Complicating matters is the recent revelation that Rain is dating drama megastar Kim Tae-hee. Given that a large chunk of Rain's official overnight stays off-base took place in Seoul, this has led to speculation that Rain abused his privileges in order to hang out with his ladyfriend — a particularly egregious offense, due principally to the fact that lots of young men in the military left behind girlfriends that they can only see a few times a year (and given that soldiers are not permitted to have their own cellphone on base, communication with loved ones isn't exactly simple). To make matters even worse, he was photographed off base without his hat — and though this may seem like a trivial matter, as a public figure who is supposed to be promoting the military as a member of the PR squad, it doesn't look good. Nor does it do him any favors as the South Korean public grows increasingly heated over his perceived indiscretions. Currently, it is being reported that a few online commenters have even suggested that he be made to repeat his military service as did Psy, who was similarly accused of using celebrity privilege to breeze through his military service.
Bernadette Peters (Dolly Gallagher Levi) is one of Broadway's most critically acclaimed and well-loved stars, having won two Tony Awards, a Golden Globe Award, four Grammy Award nominations, and three Emmy Award nominations. She received her first Tony in 1986 for Andrew Lloyd Webber's Song and Dance, and her second for the 1999 revival of Annie Get Your Gun. In 2012, she received the Isabelle Stevenson Tony Award, in recognition of her years of service to charitable organizations. Ms. Peters made her stage debut at the age of nine, and first came to the attention of New York theatergoers with her back to back acclaimed performances in both Dames at Sea (Drama Desk) and George M! (Theater World Award). She gave landmark performances in two historic Stephen Sondheim musicals: the Pulitzer Prize-winning Sunday in the Park with George, for which she received Tony and Drama Desk nominations, and Into the Woods, for which she received a Drama Desk nomination. On Broadway, she originated the title role in Jerry Herman's Mack and Mabel (Tony and Drama Desk nominations), and also starred in On the Town (Tony nomination), The Goodbye Girl (Tony nomination), Sam Mendes's revival of Gypsy (Tony and Drama Desk nominations), A Little Night Music, and Follies (Drama Desk nomination). While best known for her work in the theater, Ms. Peters stars on television in "Mozart in the Jungle" and "The Good Fight," with notable guest appearances on "Smash," "Grey's Anatomy," and "Ugly Betty."

London, England: A part-time chaplain at St. Paul's Cathedral has become the second churchman to resign over the church's attitude to the protest outside the building. Fraser Dyer said he was "embarrassed" by the decision to take legal action to try to evict the anti-capitalist protesters.
I was curious to know the Etymology of the strange Name they gave it; but my Enquiry out-reached the Sphere of our Landlord's Knowledge, and I had remained in Ignorance of this important Secret, had not a Fellow, who took Care to inform us he was the School-master of the Village, laid down his Inch of Pipe, and solv'd the Matter, in the following Manner: "A Frenchman (said he) travelling thro' this Country, and asking for Bread, had a Slice of this (for we have no other) Sort, presented him; Upon which he cried out ca est bon pour Nicol (or, as our Parish-Priest interprets it, that is good for Nicholas) a Name, it seems, he had given his Horse; which Words, in Imitation of our Betters, we have engrafted into our Language, and thence produced the barbarous Word Pompernickel."
Really Helped me Nice, comfortable and the quality of this jacket is good. Service was really good, the people of Customer service really helped me when I had problem with the sizing. I couldn't understand the size chart till they provided me separately which was more understanding. I discussed with my girlfriend and gave my order accordingly. Really warm, so basically my winter shopping is done. Thankyou so much guys, will come to check more soon. Yes, I recommend this product. Verified Purchase. I recommend this product.
Notes: First-round pick Kenny Clark and fourth-round pick Dean Lowry both were held out of most 11-on-11 drills because it was their first practice since rookie camp last month. The two rookie defensive linemen missed all of OTAs because their schools were still in session. Inside linebacker Sam Barrington still has not been cleared to return from his foot injury from Week 1 of last season. Second-year cornerback Quinten Rollins remained limited because of a hand injury he suffered early in OTAs.

“I have never heard them put any type of moral objection, remember, this is a moral objection, to men getting Viagra, but they have a moral objection to women getting certain types of birth control.What's their next moral objection, do they then object to vaccinations? Where do you take it from here? … There has been a well-documented study by a university that gave women free birth control for several years. Abortions went down by 50 percent, Chris. So if you are for life and want to attack this issue for abortion, this is a place we could work together and reduce the number of abortions. I view this as very much an anti-woman position to take. And it's important to note that women take birth control, more than half of them, as a medication for other conditions, so it is an attack on women. I think it's an attack on the religious freedom of the women who work there. Remember, no one is forced to take birth control. It's an individual right, and this is America, and this is the 21st century, and this is shocking.”

But House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, who is crafting a yearlong so-called "omnibus" spending measure, warned that effort could trigger a shutdown, and insisted no one wants to go down that road.
It's part of the Urban Agriculture Incentive Zones Act, a state law spearheaded by local sustainable land-use advocates and state Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco. The law encourages would-be urban farmers to turn trash-covered empty parcels into gardens with the assurance they won't be forced out after putting in a lot of time and money.
Julie Power The Seafood Christmas Fishing for compliments after a festive feed Happy: Second generation prawn fisherman Gary Howard trawls the Hawkesbury River near Lower Portland for his Christmas catch. Photo: Nick Moir
As the sun rays creep across the Hawkesbury river shrouded in light mist, Gary Howard pulls in his third catch of the day on board his prawn trawler. ''It's always a good thing to catch a good catch of prawns,'' he says enthusiastically as he tugs at the tangled netting, wriggling with hundreds of school prawns, a long-finned eel and a few freshwater herrings. The stray catches are quickly thrown back into the river. For 23 years Mr Howard, a second generation fisherman, has been trawling the Hawkesbury river to supply prawns to the north-western outskirts of Sydney. This is his busiest time of year. It is also the biggest catch of the day, so far. Does it make him happy? ''Of course it does,'' he says. ''You just want consumers to enjoy your products and every fisherman is probably the same that they think their catch is the best, but I don't think you could beat these prawns, especially at Christmas time,'' he says, as he grabs a handful of prawns. The Sydney Fish Markets are also gearing up for the biggest day on their calendar.
For 36 hours, starting on Monday at 5am, the markets are expecting more than 100,000 visitors, a spokeswoman confirmed. Almost 120 tonnes of prawns and 70,000 dozen oysters are expected to be snapped up before Christmas Day. But despite the busy period, it's an uncertain time for fishermen like Mr Howard. The average age of a fisherman is 59, and there are 4000 fewer than there were 20 years ago on the waterways, according to the Professional Fishermans Association. More than 85 per cent of seafood sold in NSW is imported and the state government is planning to restructure the commercial fishing industry. ''No one can predict what the true impact of this restructuring will have on our industry and many fishers will simply cease to exist,'' PFA executive officer Tricia Beatty said. ''There are big worries for fisherman over Christmas,'' Mr Howard said.
But the NSW Minister of Primary Industries, Katrina Hodgkinson, says to restructure, which may require fishermen to reapply for their jobs early next year, will strengthen the industry. "We are also aiming to remove or streamline historical fishing controls which, over many years, have forced fishers to operate inefficiently,'' she said. Back on the trawler, Mr Howard is cooking the prawns. ''They're going to heaven,'' he says as he lowers about 20 kilograms of prawns into his on-board cooker. ''You're basically a hunter, and I can't see what I'm catching, so the knowledge you gain over years to go after your target species and it makes that happen, it's very rewarding.
In a television interview from 1977, Otto Preminger was asked about choosing to cast Marilyn in his 1954 western, River of No Return. In his typically forbidding German baritone, Preminger states authoritatively: “She had no talent as an actress, but she had one thing that the camera gets. She was a born star.” Preminger, known for his string of classic film noirs (Laura, Fallen Angel, Where the Sidewalk Ends) and his brisk, severe on-set manner, never got on well with her. Co-star Robert Mitchum, playing referee between the two, seemed more sensitive to Marilyn's insecurities, and the pair – as a cowboy and saloon girl – have a memorable chemistry in spite of an unevenly plotted film.
Even without this knowledge, it's a boldly sorrowful piece of work, focusing on the romance between Gable's lonely old Reno cowboy and a neurotic, beautiful divorcee. For Marilyn, it's a role which seems close to home – she's a reflective surface for men and their desires and a frail child of a broken home. Since her husband Arthur Miller wrote the screenplay – and their marriage fell apart throughout the making of the film – it's hard not to assume that we're seeing something like the real thing in her performance.
Hathaway is now generally regarded as a journeyman director – a sort of studio workhorse who was a competent craftsman of straightforward action-adventure romps. He might never have attained the artistic heights of his fellows Howard Hawks and John Ford, but Niagara is one of his best, a surprisingly chewy and psychologically complex drama which suggests that women are perennially quicker to understand – and to act – than men.

PROFILE OF A KITE FISHERMAN
So, we know that kite fishermen are out for a more creative kind of fishing. But that isn't the only reason why someone first thought to use a kite with a fishing rig. There are a couple of very specific things that using a kite can accomplish. When you're fishing from the beach, a kite can take an attached fishing line far offshore where the larger fish are. These depths can't be reached from shore, no matter how strong of a cast you muster. When you're fishing from a boat, a cleverly set kite rig can take multiple pieces of bait set along a line and keep each piece dangling close to the surface where some prize game fish feed.
Ear plugs muffle the cacophony of clanking cans, rattling conveyor belts, rumbling motors and hissing steam. A fishy smell hangs in the air. Outside, a billboard-sized sign of a fisherman in yellow oilskins holding an oversized can of Beach Cliff sardines, the plant's primary product, serves as reminder of Maine's long sardine history.
Still, it came as a surprise to employees when Bumble Bee Foods LLC - which has owned the facility since 2004 - announced in February that the plant would close because of steep cuts in the amount of herring fishermen are allowed to catch in the Northeast. The New England Fishery Management Council set this year's herring quota at 91,000 metric tons - down from 180,000 tons in 2004 - because of the uncertain scientific outlook of the region's herring population.
Minoso famously made several comebacks for publicity long after his career was over. While working as the White Sox's first base coach in 1976, showman owner Bill Veeck convinced him to play a few games at the age of 50, and he did. It wasn't that crazy -- a 46-year-old Minoso had won MVP of the Mexican League a few years earlier -- and Minoso got a hit, going 1-for-8 at his old age. The stunt was repeated in 1980, with Minoso going 0-for-2 at the age of 54. Veeck's son, Mike, got Minoso to appear in a minor league game for the independent St. Paul Saints in 1993 and 2003. Minoso is the only MLB player to appear in five decades, and including his minor league appearances, played in games in seven decades.
In the world of Carrington's fiction, hyenas can attend balls; maids and queens alike may be offed at a moment's notice; and a gentleman asking to cure of an annoying fly may end up with navy blue skin, red zippers over his orifices. Observed critic Marina Warner: "Carrington achieves a rare tone, at once naive and perverse, comic and lethal." If you're looking for the missing link between Daniil Kharms and, say, Diane Williams (or Rebecca Curtis's weirder works), I encourage you to check out these two stories, excerpted from The Complete Stories.

Franzen always has been a "plus" player at the end of his seasons, which is why his team-worst minus-9 stands in such glare. He blamed "bad luck." Plus-minus can be a deceiving statistic (a few years back, after losing Nicklas Lidstrom as a partner, former Wings defenseman Ian White's staggering plus rating nosedived), which is why coach Mike Babcock looks at the bigger picture.
Zuewsky did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the allegations. He is listed as a junior, offensive lineman for the Mountain Hawks on the football team's roster at lehighsports.com.
Relatedly, Bronner has nothing but glowing praise for Sharon's transformation from warrior to statesman and the legacy that was cut short by his stroke. However, it is clear to him who would have been at fault had Sharon not been felled. It would not have been Sharon himself, whose record in opposition to negotiation was matched by only by his love of brute force. No, according to Bronner, it would have been Arabs and Persians who would have posed obstacles to Sharon's peace-making:
Hot Rod assembled a great cast of emerging and A-list character actors, including Isla Fisher as Denise, Rod's sweet neighbor and unrequited crush, and Will Arnett in bro-douche mode as Denise's boyfriend (“Babe, why do you hang with those nerds?”).
By and large, many are expecting a convivial hobnob between the two populist leaders, who have promised to make their respective nations great again. While some have welcomed the burgeoning Duterte-Trump bromance as a much-needed respite for a troubled alliance, others have been critical of the US president's open embrace of strongmen like Duterte.
At first base, Yonder Alonso is headed into his age-28 season having only once taken 400 plate appearances in a year, missing multiple stints over the last two seasons due to right hand, wrist, and forearm injuries. (Though he got more plate appearances as the Padres first baseman than anyone last year, it was still fewer than 50%, particularly as the departed Yasmani Grandal saw a good deal of second-half time.) He's had a 98 wRC+ over the last two years, 105 for his career, and Steamer sees him getting up to 112 along with nearly two wins this year. It'd easily be the best season of his career, and if healthy, doesn't seem unattainable. This seems like a fair projection, even a generous one, for a player who has yet to show he can be more than average.
At about 3:30 p.m., when the ship seemed as if it could not long stay afloat, Captain Roberts ordered the lifeboats lowered, and into them placed mostly women and children, but apparently no officers from the ship to command the boats, although four crewmen and a passenger who was an experienced merchant officer went in the first boat. All three boats capsized or failed to properly launch, drowning all aboard them.[2][3] Many of the men remaining on board watched their wives and children drown. One man was on his wedding trip. His bride drowned.[4] Newell describes the scene:
In the first scene, an old woman praises her beauty and suggests a profitable occupation, procuring her for the gentleman shown towards the back of the image. She is a mistress with two lovers in the second, has become a common prostitute on the point of being arrested in the third, and is beating hemp in Bridewell Prison in the fourth. By the fifth, she is dying from venereal disease, and she is dead aged only 23 in the last.
Luke Cage very much sticks to the first season formula that's served Marvel well so far: small stakes with big impact. If Matt failed, Fisk's damage was limited to Hell's Kitchen. If Jessica failed, a madman would just be roaming free as he already was. If Luke fails, the only ones that suffer are the residents of Harlem. What this gives the show is a sense of emotional weight and realization that Cage could fail. These aren't global stakes, which means Luke doesn't have to succeed for there to still be an MCU.
If this inveterate confidence on my part in the sobriety and prudent foresight of their purpose should unhappily prove unfounded; if American ships and American lives should in fact be sacrificed by their naval commanders in heedless contravention of the just and reasonable understandings of international law and the obvious dictates of humanity, I shall take the liberty of coming again before the Congress, to ask that authority be given me to use any means that may be necessary for the protection of our seamen and our people in the prosecution of their peaceful and legitimate errands on the high seas. I can do nothing less. I take it for granted that all neutral governments will take the same course.
Adol Christin is one of the most enduring heroes in gaming. For three decades now the eternally-youthful redheaded swordsman has been hunting for adventure. He's constantly getting himself embroiled in schemes to destroy the world, fighting dark gods and foiling foul plots. His exploits are the stuff of legend.
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell E. Issa, California Republican, said at least two scheduled witnesses expected to be asked about a controversial weapons investigation known as “Fast and Furious” received warning letters from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to limit their testimony.
The Gaycation team also sets up an interview with Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, who Ellen describes as "a major voice in the anti-gay movement in Brazil". After getting off to an uncomfortable start, the politician explains, "I believe that for the majority of gay people it's a behavioral issue. When I was young, talking about percentage, there were few [gay people]. Over time, due to liberal habits, drugs, with women also working, the number of homosexuals has really increased."
The concept of a killer Santa Claus had been done only twice before Christmas Evil, and both times the killer in question was simply a madman who happened to don a Santa suit. (Silent Night, Deadly Night, the most famous “killer santa” movie, came out in 1984 and largely ripped off the beats of Christmas Evil.) This film, train wreck though it may be, had much loftier ambitions than a simple slasher flick. Rather, Christmas Evil is a sincere attempt to capture a disturbed middle-aged man's slow descent into madness, as seen through the lens of his fixation with Santa Claus. Where it fails is in adequately making us understand why we should care or why he's so messed up in the first place. The entire root of his psychosis boils down to one “unimaginably horrible” childhood moment: He saw mommy kissing, and also being groped by, Santa. Flash forward 35 years, and he's apparently never experienced any other kind of stimulus, because that incident has completely dominated every aspect of his life. We know this because the movie subtly begins with him sleeping in bed, dressed as Santa.
In Croatia, lines from British political satires such as The Thick of It are applied in politics and everyday life: you will hear "Yes Minister!" in a meeting, or "Listen very carefully, I shall say this only once" ('Allo 'Allo). Croatian journalist Sergej Zupanic says that Rik Mayall vehicle The New Statesman is often referred to when speaking about corrupt politicians. Meanwhile, Zlatko Canjuga, president Franjo Tudjman's then-adviser for social issues, was nicknamed Blackadder by journalists.
Again, it goes back to the casting: Biehn's a slim guy with understated muscle. A cursory glance has him pegged for the waves over any sort of militia. He's unassuming with boyish looks and a nearly effeminate demeanor. When he finally catches a breath with Hamilton, he assumes the soldier archetype with a hint of playfulness: “Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do. Don't do that again.” Later, during an interrogation sequence at the police station, he gets theatrical playing the tough guy: “You still don't get it, do you? He'll find her! That's what he does! That's ALL he does! You can't stop him! He'll wade through you, reach down her throat, and pull her fuckin' heart out!”
Police identified the slain officer as Clint Corvinus, a four-year veteran who graduated from high school in Alamogordo. Authorities said he is survived by his parents, girlfriend and an 8-year-old daughter.
A recurring theme in my writing is documenting the comments of mainstream European statesmen on Jewish power and influence. Given my background, this has primarily focused on French leaders. In general, as these figures approach retirement or indeed death, their tongues loosen somewhat.
An RIT forechecker appeared to shove a defenseman into goaltender Stephon Williams just as linemate Josh Mitchell let a shot go. Puck, defender and goalie all ended up lying in the net, and initially the referee signaled no-goal. But a decently long review overturned the initial call, and RIT held on the rest of the way. (It was ruled that the MSU defenseman initiated contact.)
It wasn't until Brandon Tanev scored into an empty net with just seven seconds left that the Friars could breathe easy. And not that it ended up mattering, but look at this desperation save from defenseman Louie Belpedio:
But Croatian ombudsman Lora Vidovic accused Tomasic of spreading intolerance.
What respect does this man deserve especially among the “cultural establishment”? Clearly, his cultural preferences are despicable. The rule of law would dictate that he be prosecuted for his crime at the victim's discretion. Any Frenchmen with a sense of preserving their liberty should demand he be subject to the same punishment they themselves would be. Have we really reached a point where the common man is judged to a different standard than the cultural and political elite? Can a civilized society exist where the prosecution for rape occurs on the one hand but not on the other?

I'd been drinking kava in the place of alcohol for a couple of months. I found I could buy it over the counter in unmarked bags at certain Mt Roskill dairies, but mostly I was ordering it from a New Zealand-based supplier in instant form. I was mixing it into a mug of water and knocking it back; often alone but sometimes sharing it with my girlfriend or flatmates, whose reactions were varied but generally positive.
LOS ANGELES -- Alex Karras, the rugged lineman who anchored the Detroit Lions' defence in the 1960s, then went on to an acting career in which he starred in the sitcom "Webster" and famously punched a horse in the 1974 comedy "Blazing Saddles," died Wednesday. He was 77.
He was a terror on the field, using a variety of moves to push around opposing linemen and get into the backfield. His Lions handed the powerful 1962 Green Bay Packers their only defeat that season, a 26-14 upset on Thanksgiving during which they harassed quarterback Bart Starr constantly.
"We know Alex first and foremost as one of the cornerstones to our Fearsome Foursome defensive line of the 1960s and also as one of the greatest defensive linemen to ever play in the NFL," Lewand said. "Many others across the country came to know Alex as an accomplished actor and as an announcer during the early years of 'Monday Night Football."'
Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Tuesday that she reached out to the Clinton and Sanders campaign, asking them to denounce the chaos in Nevada.
Since March 2009, the all-volunteer Military Families of Cicero United has been addressing the needs of the town's military community, assisting both active and inactive servicemen and women, and creating a family support system in Cicero. Maureen Carroll, family outreach liaison, said the group provides help to veterans of World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and any other place where an American soldier or sailor from Cicero has been sent.
Sanchez Bros., 6031 Cermak Road, Cicero, is the place for a crisp, brimmed Stetson hat, ostrich skin belt, Tony Llama lizard-skinned boots, a pearl-buttoned plaid shirt and a western-embroidered jacket with matching pants. This is the new western cool, and Cermak Road in Cicero may very well be the Rodeo Drive for those who like to sport cowboy styles.
It's worth noting that if you have somehow stumbled on this page as part of researching a term paper about flops, and you have to submit that paper to a real adult that actually understands flops, then you should probably just watch that video and move on. Mainly because it includes several insights from the man on the left and zero from the gentleman on the right.

“When I found out we were releasing Irish Death in cans I threw up with excitement,” said Ross Chalstrom, who we like to refer to as Cowboy Ross. “My hands are petite and my grip isn't the strongest so the cans make getting Irish Death to my mouth easier.”
Cincinnati transfer Luke Wright – a walk-on who was granted immediately eligibility after following Gran and quarterbacks coach Darin Hinshaw from Cincinnati to UK – made his debut late in the win as the Wildcats' No. 3 quarterback. Freshman quarterback Gunnar Hoak will also receive reps in practice this week in case he is forced into action, Stoops said.
The Bears will be without top defenseman Madison Bowey (rest). In coach Mann's post-game interview, Mann said Bowey was 100% but, “He would play definitely one game, maybe two,” during this 3-game weekend.
Something I discovered early from our conversations is that the majority of my Black teammates had White girlfriends and most of the ones who were single preferred to only date White girls. I found that bizarre, especially sinse I had never even kissed a White girl before. "Do these guys want to be White?", I thought. But it didn't take long to figure out that they weren't trying to be anything other than themselves.
If the McElroys had decided to hold back from exploring LGBTQIA individuals further because of how Hurley and Sloane played out, they would have never gotten to provide a depiction of a lesbian couple that actually survived to the end of the story and had a presence throughout the campaign, through Killian the orc and Carey the dragonborn. The latter only appeared in the storyline in the arc directly after the one with Hurley and Sloane. Taako would most likely have never gotten a boyfriend in the form of the Grim Reaper, a relationship that also survived to the end of the game. (That sounds like a metaphor, but … no, Taako dated the literal Grim Reaper.) We would have probably never gotten a great depiction of a trans woman in the form of Lup, Taako's sister, and the campaign definitely would not have ended with everyone coming together to celebrate Killian and Carey's wedding in one of the happiest days of their lives.
Despite having faced serious injury problems themselves, Twente's season has been a quite stable one. Their 4-3-3 formation, finally re-adopted by Michel Preud'homme after a short switch to the 4-2-3-1 earlier this season, is characterized by stability too. The midfield three of Janssen, Brama and Landzaat play a narrow controlled system with lots of movement in possession. Brama plays the most conservative role, generally man-marking the opposing advanced midfielder, Bakkal in this case. Landzaat is the most advanced man, making well-timed runs from deep to arrive late in the box. Finally, Theo Janssen is the spin-doctor of Twente's team, providing an excellent deep-lying playmaker role with the combination of his technical skills and vision.
Comparing the Prez election results to modern electoral allocations, the fact that Downey does worse in 2036 (he has 43 fewer electoral votes than he would have in 2016) and Farmer does better (he has 43 more electoral votes than he would have in 2016) indicates that in the future world of Prez – since the allocation of state electors is based on population – red states are more populated and therefore have more Congressional representation and electors than they do today. Republican presidential candidates can win office with a fewer number of states than Democrats, and there are presumably a higher number of conservative Congressmen in the House of Representatives.
Even Borat would have laughed at the security precautions the president of Kazakhstan took during a dinner in Manhattan — as the Central Asian strongman demanded waiters at a posh Soho restaurant be replaced with his own lackeys, his dishes be disinfected with vodka, and a doctor test every morsel of food for danger, sources said.
â€œIt is disturbing that James Rosen, who covers the State Department for Fox News was targeted,â€ said CCRKBA Chairman Alan Gottlieb, â€œbut now published reports suggest that the DOJ, in a separate effort, apparently also targeted Fox News reporter William La Jeunesse, who broke several stories about Operation Fast and Furious.

Hilliard (6-foot, 230 pounds) is the first of LSU's underclassmen considering an early jump to the NFL to decide against it. Hill declared his intentions to enter the draft earlier Monday, as did offensive guard Trai Turner. Along with Blue, defensive tackles Anthony Johnson and Ego Ferguson have announced they will enter the draft, while wide receivers Odell Beckham and Jarvis Landry will reportedly do so as well. That makes a whopping 17 LSU underclassmen to declare for early draft entry over the last two seasons, including seven following the 2013 campaign, and Tigers left tackle La'El Collins might soon make it eight.
According to the “progressives” at the CAP, the answer is yes. “This concern [over deficits] is understandable but misplaced. Studies show that investing money in high-quality preschool will actually improve our country's fiscal health by strengthening human capital, enhancing economic growth, increasing revenues, and decreasing future spending obligations.” Why, even Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke agrees with them on this, they point out. And Bernanke, of course, has never been wrong about anything.
I have been a DC Comics fangirl for thirty years, and I've never been embarrassed by that until now.
So how conservative is Instagram? It clearly depends on the user. Though they seem to be lenient with several celebrities, they were less so with the experiment tried by Jake Ingalls, Spaceface frontman and Flaming Lips touring member. “Well, my experiment did something,” he wrote on facebook on a few days after Wayne's original boot. “Posted this on Instagram with the caption ‘Rebellious Sexedelic Instagram Post' .. Got a shit ton of likes and then they only removed the picture – not my entire account.” It seems if he re-posted this several more times however, Instagram would delete his account:

Baltimore Ravens: Defensive tackle Carl Davis played in 65.8 percent of snaps against the Jagaurs; the most playing time for him in a game since being drafted by the Ravens in 2015. On the season he has a run stop percentage of 20.0 percent which is the best for interior linemen this season.
Pittsburgh Steelers: Defensive linemen Cameron Heyward has 15 pressures on the year after a two-pressure performance in Week 3, which is tied for second-most with all interior defenders on the season.
Philadelphia Eagles: All four of the Eagles starting defensive linemen have three or more sacks and hits combined. They are one of just two teams where each of the primary four pass rushers each have gotten to the quarterback that many times.
After his release from jail, Curtis is enthusiastically welcomed back by his neighborhood, and is clearly anxious to get right back into the drug dealing game. He attempts to get revenge by ambushing "white hat's" girlfriend, but in retaliation, they kill his girlfriend and mother of his child. Her death causes Curtis to sink into depression, as he now has to take care of his young son while continuing to deal drugs. In one scene, as he cuts and bags up crack to sell, he explains how he watched his uncle do exactly the same thing when he was a kid, and comments that his son is the same age he was and watching him engage in the same behavior.

The answer seems to be no, if you've paid any attention to posts written on the subject that have been blowing up my little patch of the Internet lately. Of course I'm referring to “I'm An Asian Woman And I Refuse To Ever Date An Asian Man” by Jenny An, and the clickbait-y response to An's clickbait-y call, “I Am An Asian Woman And I Think Asian Boyfriends Are Superior (Well, Mine Is Anyway),” by Clarissa Wei, both published on xojane, a site to which I've contributed.
The other problem with these posts is that they put race and gender at odds with one another, like they have this mutually exclusive relationship, and you have to choose one or the other to have some kind of cohesive identity. If you believe An's argument–which she later backpedaled on, calling it “a character” designed to provoke discussion–as an Asian woman, in order to reject “patriarchy and cultural sexism,” you have to be a racist dick and hate your people. And if you believe Wei's argument, which asserts that Asian boyfriends are the best because they make “a lot” of money, shower their girlfriends with gifts, and point out when you've gained weight…wait, what? Pause for station identification:
“He helps me keep fit. Being fat is not okay in a stereotypically Asian community. My boyfriend works out to stay fit and frequents the gym on a daily basis. And when I'm packing on the pounds, he notices.”
Consider, too, the ceaseless insults hurled at the stupid, poor white people who voted to leave the EU. These are folk who struggle to maintain a first home, let alone a second – people who can barely afford to go on holiday at all. These are the fishermen, from Aberdeen to Hull to Ramsgate to Hastings to Cornwall, whose livelihoods have been devastated by the EU – the same fishermen taunted by Bob Geldof and his champagne-swilling chums. These are the people living in Peterborough and Boston who can't get doctor's appointments or find school places for their children because hospitals and schools are overwhelmed. These are people whose small businesses have been ruined by Operation Stack in Kent, whereby lorries clog up the roads for miles, the result of Schengen Area free movement that has led to the mayhem in Calais. Consider those people in Wales who faced the daily, humiliating reminder that their economy was dependent on hand-outs from the EU. Consider, too, all these English people in Dover and Folkestone who know Poles and Latvians, not as cheap domestic staff but as neighbours, parents of their children's schoolfriends, as equals. All these people slandered as vermin and racists.
Between these two, six Super Bowl rings and two Halls of Fame careers have been forged (trust us, Vinatieri will make Canton). And up in Brookings, S.D., there are a nephew and a grandson who grin ear-to-ear when talking about their famous relatives. Freshman placekicker Chase Vinatieri is the nephew of the famous kicker, while senior defensive lineman Cole Langer is the grandson of the current Hall of Famer. Both SDSU players are standouts for the nationally ranked Jackrabbits.

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Workmen were attempting to finish electrical fittings and lay tiles at a new terminal in northern Nigeria's Kaduna airport on Wednesday just hours before it takes over responsibility for handling passengers bound for the capital Abuja.
A Reuters team saw workmen on scaffolding putting electrical fittings in place and fitting tiles in some parts of the Kaduna complex.

"As a video gamer myself, this data theft is especially worrying and I'm not altogether surprised that Sony are likely to see an exodus to console competitors," said CouponCodes4U Chairman Mark Pearson. "As hackers get more and more intelligent, companies simply have to keep up. Sony has a responsibility to its millions of customers to protect personal details and this data theft proves that they weren't capable of doing so. It's clear that gamers across the country have decided that this failing is enough to switch their allegiances to the console's closest rival."
"What needs to be done is we need to have our agents in the field where they belong, we need to stop cutting our manpower and stop cutting our hours and get our guys out there on the front line so that we can secure this border," he said. "At least from what we heard they don't seem too concerned about it. They think, they don't think anything's going to happen down here, and I hope they're right. However, I don't think they are. I think it's just a matter of time before we see the first one."
Anyway, here's my simple manifesto for practical regime change. In an ideal world, a million Frenchmen meet in Paris and enforce these demands, basically now. It's not an ideal world and this won't happen — but shouldn't we know where we want to go?
The awards keep stacking up for the Houston Astros after their historic World Series win.On Thursday, Louisville Slugger announced that second baseman Jose Altuve and outfielder George Springer won Silver Slugger Awards as the top offensive players in their respective positions in the American League.Altuve and Springer are the first pair of Astros to win the award since 1999, the team announced.Springer, the World Series MVP, is a first-time winner of the award after hitting .283, scoring 112 runs and hitting 34 homers during the regular season. With Springer's popularity, a petition has been started to name a street in New Britain, Connecticut after the Astros slugger. This year's Silver Slugger Award marks the fourth for Altuve.Last night, Altuve took home a pair of Players Choice Awards after being named the MLB Player of the Year and the AL Most Outstanding Player Altuve remains a finalist for the BBWAA AL Most Valuable Player Award, which will be announced Nov. 16.
Bungling Liverpool council workmen painted road markings warning not to block the entrance to a school – after failing to notice it had been knocked down more than a year ago.
But local residents and councillors said they were amazed the workmen had not applied some common sense when doing their job, which involved repainting tired old markings outside the school gates.
Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks Box 4 Patent and Trademark Office Washington, DC 20231 Dear Commissioner: Along with many other computer scientists, I would like to ask you to reconsider the current policy of giving patents for computational processes. I find a considerable anxiety throughout the community of practicing computer scientists that decisions by the patent courts and the Patent and Trademark Office are making life much more difficult for programmers. In the period 1945-1980, it was generally believed that patent law did not pertain to software. However, it now appears that some people have received patents for algorithms of practical importance - e.g., Lempel-Ziv compression and RSA public key encryption - and are now legally preventing other programmers from using these algorithms. This is a serious change from the previous policy under which the computer revolution became possible, and I fear this change will be harmful for society. It certainly would have had a profoundly negative effect on my own work: For example, I developed software called TeX that is now used to produce more than 90% of all books and journals in mathematics and physics and to produce hundreds of thousands of technical reports in all scientific disciplines. If software patents had been commonplace in 1980, I would not have been able to create such a system, nor would I probably have ever thought of doing it, nor can I imagine anyone else doing so. I am told that the courts are trying to make a distinction between mathematical algorithms and nonmathematical algorithms. To a computer scientist, this makes no sense, because every algorithm is as mathematical as anything could be. An algorithm is an abstract concept unrelated to physical laws of the universe. Nor is it possible to distinguish between "numerical" and "nonnumerical" algorithms, as if numbers were somehow different from other kinds of precise information. All data are numbers, and all numbers are data. Mathematicians work much more with symbolic entities than with numbers. Therefore the idea of passing laws that say some kinds of algorithms belong to mathematics and some do not strike me as absurd as the 19th century attempts of the Indiana legislature to pass a law that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is exactly 3, not approximately 3.1416. It's like the medieval church ruling that the sun revolves about the earth. Man-made laws can be significantly helpful but not when they contradict fundamental truths. Congress wisely decided long ago that mathematical things cannot be patented. Surely nobody could apply mathematics if it were necessary to pay a license fee whenever the theorem of Pythagoras is employed. The basic algorithmic ideas that people are now rushing to patent are so fundamental, the result threatens to be like what would happen if we allowed authors to have patents on individual words and concepts. Novelists or journalists would be unable to write stories unless their publishers had permission from the owners of the words. Algorithms are exactly as basic to software as words are to writers, because they are the fundamental building blocks needed to make interesting products. What would happen if individual lawyers could patent their methods of defense, or if Supreme Court justices could patent their precedents? I realize that the patent courts try their best to serve society when they formulate patent law. The Patent Office has fulfilled this mission admirably with respect to aspects of technology that involve concrete laws of physics rather than abstract laws of thought. I myself have a few patents on hardware devices. But I strongly believe that the recent trend to patenting algorithms is of benefit only to a very small number of attorneys and inventors, while it is seriously harmful to the vast majority of people who want to do useful things with computers. When I think of the computer programs I require daily to get my own work done, I cannot help but realize that none of them would exist today if software patents had been prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s. Changing the rules now will have the effect of freezing progress at essentially its current level. If present trends continue, the only recourse available to the majority of America's brilliant software developers will be to give up software or to emigrate. The U.S.A. will soon lose its dominant position. Please do what you can to reverse this alarming trend. There are far better ways to protect the intellectual property rights of software developers than to take away their right to use fundamental building blocks. Sincerely, Donald E. Knuth Professor Emeritus
We received a warm welcome at the airport and were escorted to Fortis Hospital Delhi wherein we met Dr. Randeep Wadhawan. He was a gentleman who explained what to expect during the bariatric surgery and post surgery. This really helped me to clear all my doubts and anxieties I had regarding the surgery. My surgery went as per schedule. The recovery was smooth. I was impressed with the care, compassion I received from the Surgeon at Fortis Hospital Delhi, Dr. Randeep Wadhawan, the nurses and staff took care of all my needs.

Konstantin: First off, the obligatory I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOUR GAMES fanboy drooling. Followed up with thanking him for his general contribution to doujin culture, which led to a discussion of the difference between doujin and indies, Touhou fandom in the West, the scope of the fandom, and what different people find attractive in Touhou.
And by the way, this isn't obscure stuff. To take one example: the work of Mian and Sufi on household debt and the slump has been playing a big role in making the case for a demand-driven depression, which is exactly the kind of situation in which stimulus makes sense — so you have to be completely out of it and/or unscrupulous to cite some of their work and claim that it refutes the case for stimulus. Or to take another example, which Brad DeLong picks up, anyone following the debate knows that the Baker et al paper claiming to show that uncertainty is holding back recovery clearly identifies the relevant uncertainty as arising from things like the GOP's brinksmanship over the debt ceiling — not things like Obamacare.

Setting Edit Red Dead Redemption spans New Austin and West Elizabeth, two fictitious states of the United States, as well as Nuevo Paraiso, a fictitious Mexican state. New Austin and West Elizabeth are adjacent to each other and share a southern border with Mexico. Nuevo Paraiso is a Mexican state, separated from U.S. territory by the San Luis River. The game takes place primarily in the year 1911, featuring the final decade of the American Frontier and the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects are beginning to appear. Plot Edit The game begins in 1911, where former outlaw John Marston (Rob Wiethoff) is taken from his family by Bureau of Investigation agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and his partner, Archer Fordham (David Wilson Barnes), and will only be granted amnesty when he brings the remaining members of his old gang to justice. John is escorted to the town of Armadillo, and sets off to track down Bill Williamson (Steve J. Palmer). He confronts Williamson and his men at their stronghold, Fort Mercer, only to be shot and left for dead. Local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane (Kimberly Irion) finds him critically wounded and takes him to her ranch for recovery. Several days later, John begins repaying the MacFarlanes for their help in the form of odd jobs around the ranch. During this time he works with U.S. Marshal Leigh Johnson (Anthony De Longis) and his deputies Eli (Brad Carter) and Jonah (Frank Noon), con artist Nigel West Dickens (Don Creech), treasure hunter and grave robber Seth Briars (Kevin Glikmann), and an unreliable alcoholic arms dealer known only as Irish (K. Harrison Sweeney). John performs various tasks and favors in exchange for their help with organizing an attack on Fort Mercer. John and his group then breach the fort and defeat Williamson's gang only to find that Williamson had fled to Mexico to seek help from Javier Escuella (Antonio Jaramillo), another former member of John's gang. In Mexico, John sides with Mexican Army Colonel Agustín Allende (Gary Carlos Cervantes) and his right-hand man Captain Vincente de Santa (Hector Luis Bustamante), to help end a rebellion in return for Allende delivering Escuella and Williamson to him. However, Allende betrays John, who then sides with the rebels. With the initial help of elderly gunslinger Landon Ricketts (Ross Hagen), John, along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes (Josh Segarra) and one of his lovers, Luisa (Francesca Galeas), eventually turns the tide in favor of the rebels, killing de Santa and launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress. They find Escuella, who attempts to bargain for his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende's protection. John is given the option to either kill Escuella or turn him over to the Bureau. John and Reyes then take the fight to Allende, where Luisa is killed while trying to protect Reyes. As Allende's palace is stormed by the rebels, both he and Williamson flee, but are apprehended and killed. Reyes then takes charge of the local government and plans to advance on the capital, while John leaves to meet with the Bureau in Blackwater. Agents Ross and Fordham refuse to let John return to his family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down the only remaining member of his previous gang who is still active as an outlaw: its leader and John's surrogate father, Dutch van der Linde (Benjamin Byron Davis). John learns that Dutch has been forming a new gang of Native Americans, and after surviving several ambushes and thwarting a bank robbery, joins Ross, Fordham, and a group of U.S. soldiers in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, John chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter, mortally wounded, warns John that the Bureau won't let him have peace and then commits suicide by backing off the cliff. John is released from his deal with Ross and returns to his ranch where his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack (Josh Blaylock) are waiting. John devotes his time tending to the ranch, having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. However, Ross double-crosses John, and leads a combined force of soldiers, lawmen, and government agents after him. John is able to fend off several waves of attackers and gets his family to safety, but stays behind to hold back the rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men, and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking the ranch. Three years later in 1914, following the death of his mother, Jack tracks down the now-retired Ross, and kills him in a duel, avenging his father and continuing the path of violence his father had tried to keep away from him. The fates of John's companions are later summarized in newspaper articles and NPC dialog: Marshal Leigh Johnson retired from Armadillo at age 54 and moved away, Reyes was consumed by power and became a tyrant, Bonnie MacFarlane eventually married, Irish shot himself dead in an outhouse when his gun accidentally discharged, Seth Briars eventually found treasure and became rich, and Landon Ricketts died quietly in his sleep.
The latest to trigger a double-zero reset is Russell Haughton-James, the West Virginia offensive lineman who WV Metro News is reporting was arrested on one count of burglary Sunday night. No specifics as to what led up to Haughton-James' arrest have been released.
Joana Gröblinghoff, a Swedish blogger, is a favorite of these accounts. Her soft, girlish self-portraits are featured in tons of tweets by white supremacist accounts I found, accompanied by text like “White women must be protected from the hordes of imported savages that are swarming into Northern countries. #WhiteGenocide.” In another Tweet, Gröblinghoff's face is juxtaposed with photos of black women with the caption “inhuman vs perfection.”
Two German citizens were attacked—one was abducted and the other killed—earlier this month while sailing their yacht near Sabah, a Malaysian state in Borneo. And over the weekend, two Indonesian fishermen were abducted in two separate incidents off Sabah. In October, a South Korean ship was seized, with its captain and Philippine crewmember also taken hostage.
Australia's litany of fearsome fauna seems to have a new entry. Added to deadly snakes, man-eating crocodiles and poisonous jellyfish comes Hermie the huntsman, a spider so unusually large and strong that it had no problem carrying a sizeable mouse up the outside of a fridge.
“So we proceed to his place and he shows me this. Huntsman trying to eat a mouse.”
“This is the first time I've seen one catch a mouse, but I have seen huntsmen catch geckos. I've seen a redback spider catch a snake in its web, I've seen a golden orb spider catch birds.”
Milledge said the banded huntsman could grow to have a leg span as large as 16cm.
“I would be very surprised if a huntsman would attack a mouse and even if it did, that the venom would be sufficient to kill it fast enough for the spider to still have hold of it,” she told the Guardian.
An alternative option would be for the Mets to bench first baseman Lucas Duda and shift Bruce to first to open spots for all three of the other outfielders. But the Mets remain hopeful that Duda will turn around his early-season struggles, and they would like to avoid playing Bruce out of position if possible. I'd be surprised if the Mets go that route right now.
I didn't know a soul when I first moved to Melbourne, so I moved in with Cameron and his girlfriend and now wife, Barb. Then Bill moved in. It was the four of us in a three-bedroom townhouse right in the middle of Richmond.

I was at the hospital when Cameron and Bill's kids were born and they came to the hospital when my kids arrived. We've been to each other's weddings. Cameron and Bill were groomsmen at mine and I'm looking forward to Cooper's wedding at the end of the year.
“A perfect example of needing to watch the catcher happened last night. When teams shift against Boston, the runner at first hasn't been sliding (into second). He's been taking off toward third, because you don't have anybody there. The third baseman is in short right field and the shortstop has to cover second. I've reminded Matt (Wieters) that if a ground ball is hit, he has to bust over to third. On a ball hit to the right side, a pitcher's first instinct is to head to first, so there's no way he can stop and get over there in time. It has to be the catcher, and once I see Matt break that way, I can watch the rest of the play develop.

The IceHogs wouldn't give up just yet as defenseman Viktor Svedberg took a pass from Alex Broadhurst and fired a blast from the blue line to once again bring the Hogs within one at 3-2 with 8:27 left in regulation.
Just 1:29 into the second period the Heat added to their tally. Ferland stole the puck in the neutral zone and Simpson stopped the initial break-away shot but Heat centerman Paul Byron was there to tap the rebound home to make it 2-0.
The idea crossed his mind because he was interested in doing a part that's “broad and physical.” Then his girlfriend independently came up with the idea, and that solidified the notion. He liked the visual humor of a “large woman manhandling people.” “I originally wanted to do this thing where she was almost like a bodyguard for President Clinton,” Ferrell says, “and they'd be in Cabinet meetings and she wouldn't say anything, and then if Clinton didn't like the person she'd be like, `Bill, do you want me to get rid of him?' ” Instead, he and co-writer Scott Wainio came up with Janet Reno's dance party. In these segments, Reno is shown in trademark blue dress, partying in her basement, introducing guests mainly for the sake of humiliating them, quizzing teenagers and then telling them to shut up. “We just kind of created this, like, tough woman who lives in this make-believe world,” he says.
The club has increased its payroll to a franchise-high $63.1 million -- less than $1.5 million under the salary cap -- after a summer makeover that included the free-agent signings of defensemen James Wisniewski and Radek Martinek and winger Vinny Prospal.
The puck drops here The NHL season begins tonight. Here's a quick look at some teams and items of interest: Columbus Blue Jackets The Blue Jackets made major roster changes to upgrade their offense, but their fate could be determined by their fourth-year goaltender. Steve Mason followed a rookie-of-the-year season with two shaky seasons that saw the Jackets post back-to-back 13th-place finishes in the Western Conference. The additions of Jeff Carter, Vinny Prospal and James Wisniewski should vastly improve their power play. But the club remains in one of the league's most competitive divisions (Central) with Chicago, Detroit, Nashville and St. Louis. Detroit Red Wings The Wings remain a playoff lock, but the veteran group made few changes to the club bounced by San Jose in the second round for a second straight season. Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk are still one of the best 1-2 forward combinations in the league. Ageless defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom is coming off another Norris Trophy season, but the loss of Brian Rafalski hurts. Pittsburgh Penguins The health of Sidney Crosby (concussion) remains one of the NHL's biggest stories. The Penguins superstar hasn't played since early January and will not play in the club's opener. Pittsburgh, however is getting back center Evgeni Malkin, who missed the second half of last season due to knee surgery. The Penguins are a playoff lock, but not Stanley Cup contenders unless Crosby is in top form in April. Buffalo Sabres The biggest news here is in the owner's box, where billionaire and Sabres fan Terry Pegula purchased the team during last season and started pouring money into the roster. They signed defenseman Christian Ehrhoff to a 10-year, $40 million deal and forward Ville Leino to a six-year, $27 million contract. Goaltender Ryan Miller gives the Sabres a chance to win every game. Colorado Avalanche The parent club of the Lake Erie Monsters should field a fast-skating, offensive-minded group of forwards. The big question is whether their goaltending will be improved. The Avs paid a steep price in acquiring talented, but oft-injured Semyon Varlamov from Washington. They also are hoping to get more offense from their blue line. Erik Johnson should help in that area, but the Avs remain a long shot for the playoffs. Around the league
Goldberg said the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative is currently working with Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) to craft a federal revenge porn bill.
In 2016, Coleen was treated inappropriately while on a trip to Hong Kong, and she and her boyfriend Billy Crawford spoke to Hong Kong police after.
Johnston has been on the shelf since October when he underwent back surgery for a herniated disc that was affecting his length strength. The defenceman really impressed during the rookie tournament in September, so he is an interesting prospect to follow as the IceCaps will look to strengthen a shaky defensive corps that allows close to 40 shots against per game.
Prior to court yesterday morning I made the decision to love and to forgive. I've been so angry and hurt by family's treatment of me, my youngest son, my youngest daughter and her boyfriend for a NONoffense based our little girl's boyfriend's skin color. I want so much for them to see that we should base our judgment for others on character, not on something over which none of us have control.
I will close with something my daughter's boyfriend shared. He posted a picture of him with my daughter with this caption: Hey so this is my lovely fiancé Laura Miller. She's not white. She's Laura Renee Miller. And this is me Michael Walker. I'm not black I'm Michael Alexander Walker. Black or white is a primitive concept used to label people. People are people. It doesn't matter what ethnicity (or “color”) you are – it's what's on the inside that counts. And the sooner that happens; the sooner there will be a huge IQ raise in the world.
When deputies arrived, a man told them his roommate had cut him with a knife, pointed a handgun at him and his girlfriend and wouldn't let them leave their apartment, the Sheriff's Office said.

WINNIPEG – Kicker Justin Medlock and offensive lineman Stanley Bryant will remain Winnipeg Blue Bombers after finalizing a restructured of their contracts.
Sources in the party headquarters said Tuesday night that they had considered dismissing the public relations firm in charge of the campaign, Peer Levin PR, but Zionist Camp Chairman Isaac Herzog denied the claim.
Although the Saudis would undoubtedly deny it, they have likely taken a small step to inform Egypt exactly how they feel about Cairo's new policies. Saudi Minister of Manpower Adil Fakieh recently revealed that Riyadh would not renew work permits for foreign workers who have been in the country for more than six years. This directly impacts Egypt, for this new rule applies to as many as 1.5 million of its workers, many of whom send their remittances back their home country (to family, and friends). Without these funds, many Egyptian households will suffer. Moreover, should these 1.5 million workers find themselves out of work, unemployment in Egypt will naturally skyrocket, leading to further adverse economic consequences for an already weak Egyptian economy. It is no surprise that the Egyptian political analyst Hassan Nafaa has declared that the Saudi proclamation is akin to extortion.
There is not a scintilla of evidence that this happened, and even as the Trump administration likes to claim that progressives who protest their actions are being sore losers, it's hard to imagine a more flagrant sign of bad sportsmanship than denying mathematical reality because it bruises your ego.
Though the ad was shot in Moscow last Thursday, there are no plans to broadcast it in Russia. Esteemed in the West as the statesman who ended the cold war, Mr. Gorbachev is extremely unpopular in Russia, where he is blamed for allowing the Soviet Union to fall apart and for not having pushed reform of the command economy far enough. When he ran for the presidency last year -- his first campaign for public office -- he won less than 1 percent of the vote. To put it another way, Mr. Gorbachev's endorsement of Pizza Hut could well cause sales in Moscow to drop dramatically.
‘We are thrilled by this announcement and proud to be joining forces with Nasa in the final steps of the technology maturation,' said Dr Franklin Chang Diaz, Ad Astra's Chairman and CEO, in a statement.

Why do you think there is so much push to send INEC Chairman Attahiru Jega to Siberia? By the time you're reading this piece, Jega would have been history! Why do you think Attorney General and Minister of Justice Adoke filed and later withdrew affidavit against the use of updated electronic voters register and permanent voters card? Why do you think the election was postponed? Why do you think Mr. Jonathan obstinately refused to investigate the Ekitigate video on how PDP used he is military and the police to rig the gubernatorial election in Ekiti State despite the fact that he was implicated by Musiliu Obanikoro?
Jean Meslier was born January 15, 1664, in Mazerny in the Ardennes. He began learning Latin from a neighborhood priest in 1678 and eventually joined the seminary. He later claimed, in the Author's Preface to his Testament, that this was done to please his parents. At the end of his studies, he took Holy Orders and, on January 7, 1689, became priest at Étrépigny, in Champagne. One public disagreement with a local nobleman aside, Meslier was to all appearances generally unremarkable, and he performed his office without complaint or problem for 40 years.
Directed by Chris Buck (Tarzan, Surf's Up) and Jennifer Lee (screenwriter on Wreck-It Ralph), Frozen explores the relationship between two sisters, heirs to the throne of Arendelle—the optimistic Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) and Elsa, who has powers she can't truly control (Wicked star Idina Menzel). Along the way, there are romantic interests, the comic snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) and a colorful cast of characters that provide the film's heroine with her share of laughs, thrills and chills.

Third baseman Adrián Beltré and DH Carlos Beltrán, who debuted in 1998 and were united in Texas last month after Beltrán's deadline trade to the team, are the most accomplished active players who haven't won a World Series. Now they're batting back to back for a team that's jockeying with Cleveland for the best record in the American League. And thanks to their similar surnames, they have a readymade, tag-team-quality nickname, which made it onto a T-shirt not long into their time as teammates.
Baltimore Ravens defensive lineman Brandon Williams is looking to cash in this offseason. Either through the franchise tag or a long-term deal, Williams should get the first large contract of his career, and he knows that takes hard work.
It's a cute take on what life as a lineman can be like and in Williams' patented humor to boot. Hopefully the Ravens can re-sign him this offseason, and we'll get to see more of these little skits.
The conservation plan has some flexibility. The report presents multiple scenarios involving changing predator-control methodologies depending on when and how much funding is available and how much effort is put in by volunteers. Obviously some of that money and manpower may never materialize, as is always the case with conservation. Even under the worst-case options, though, Kiwis for kiwi says it's possible to at least stabilize all kiwi populations. After a century of decline that's good news indeed and cause for hope.
When Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1799, remains were taken from Tanis to Europe, including to the cities of Paris, Berlin and St Petersburg. The first Western archaeologist to excavate in Tanis was the Frenchman Auguste Mariette, followed by the English Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and French Egyptologist Pierre Montet.
The Army will issue an advisory to servicemen from Kashmir about precautions they need to take while on leave, especially in South Kashmir, where dozens of local youths have joined militant ranks since the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani. This is being done following the killing of Lt Ummer Fayaz in South Kashmir's Batapora village, where he had gone to attend a wedding.
The massive investments which Qatar has made in suburbs are made because of the very high proportion of Muslims who are in the French suburbs…We are allowing a foreign country to choose its investments on the basis of the religion of this or that part of the French population or of French territory. I think this situation could be very dangerous… I say solemnly, the Qataris are financial supporters of Islamic fundamentalists, madmen of Sharia. The French have a right to know that, especially in Libya, the jihadists who are now in power and whose first action was to apply Sharia, were financed and armed by Qatar.
Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani had especially called the Committee of Whole House meeting on Wednesday for the briefing following an assurance by the ISI DG that he would appear before the Senate body.
I don't know about anyone else, but I didn't pick my college because of free condom handouts or the huge array of pamphlets in the health center. Maybe some of you had that in your heads as you were finalizing that statement of intent, but I'd venture a guess that most prospective freshmen have bigger things on their minds than the quality of their favorite school's sex ed. We want to examine programs, compare tuitions, and figure out exactly how far we need to go to keep the family's weekend visits to a minimum. I think it's safe to say that nobody prioritizes or plans to use what resources your sexual violence program offers. Unless you're this guy. So sometimes, it can be a toss-up what kinds of reproductive resources you wind up with. Some of us, like me, just get lucky.
When Edward Snowden met journalists in his cramped room in Hong Kong's Mira hotel in June, his mission was ambitious. Amid the clutter of laundry, meal trays and his four laptops, he wanted to start a debate about mass surveillance. He succeeded beyond anything the journalists or Snowden himself ever imagined. His disclosures about the NSA resonated with Americans from day one. But they also exploded round the world. For some, like Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, it is a vitally important issue, one of the biggest of our time: nothing less than the defence of democracy in the digital age.

That Saarijarvi shoots right was part of the appeal in drafting him, as right-shot defensemen are rarer than left-shooting ones. Saarijarvi is mobile, makes good decisions with the puck, and has a knack for getting his shot through from the blueline. He'll have a chance with the Griffins to show he can run a power play in the AHL, as he did in the OHL.
Chairman Abidi said the SCO needed to be kept alive without putting pressure on the exchequer.
“ Initially I was shocked that a Navy ship, or any ship, could not have known the taunt was a joke. This is seamanship 101. I clearly remember having the taunt whispered in my ear by an upperclassman during my plebe year that the Naval Academy and by the time I received my officers license I had heard it hundreds of time. How could the officers of the cruiser Port Royal not know this was a common joke? I'm admitting still confused but after hearing the audio file I must say it doesn't sound like the typical ‘Filipino Monkey' taunt.”
A mass grave was discovered on Beacon Island in 1999, but archaeologists had to wait 15 years before old fishermen shacks were removed so they could comb the entire island for clues left behind in 1629.
Hogan announced his candidacy in June. He is expected to run unchallenged for the Republican ticket next year. Jealous is facing a Democratic primary with four candidates, including Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker,III so far.

As with the Kennedy administration cut short by a bullet in the next century, “Garfield's presidency is now associated with a string of ‘might have beans.' The nine-time Ohio Congressman ran on a platform that featured strong stands on both civil rights and civil-service reform. In his inaugural address Garfield called ‘the elevating of the Negro race from slavery to full rights of citizenship the most important political change … since the adoption of the Constitution' and promised to fight those who would deny Negroes freedom of the ballot “

Topping the list: Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who stood by and allowed the party he leads to be hijacked by a man who, if he even is a Republican, stands for everything the Republican Party is against. Donald Trump says he opposed the war in Iraq; the GOP's for it. Donald Trump has said he's for single-payer health insurance; the GOP's against it. Donald Trump is, at best, silent on same-sex marriage; the GOP's dead-set against. Does the Republican Party really stand for anything? Does Priebus?
Attention pitchers and catchers of New York City, the New York Mets have announced that they will host an LGBT Pride night this baseball season. They will be the first major league New York City baseball team to hold such an event. Though the night has yet to be officially announced, the team announced the event Friday. “More than 5,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) baseball fans will fill Citi Field at this historic event. Thousands of fans will wear commemorative Pride Night shirts with a portion of each ticket sale going to support the LGBT Network's anti-bullying programs in Long Island and New York City schools,” the Mets announced. “The New York tri-state area is home to an estimated 2 million LGBT residents and families who have long felt left out and not safe in major league ballparks and arenas.” RELATED: NJ man who faked New York Mets signatures pleads guilty to fraud The event may cause some consternation in the Met's bullpen. As NJ.com reported, at least one team member disapproves of homosexuality, yet remains open to someone gay joining the team. “I don't think the fact that someone is a homosexual should completely shut the door on investing in them in a relational aspect," said New York Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy. "You can still accept them but I do disagree with the lifestyle, 100 percent.” The official pride night has yet to be announced. Tickets will be sold starting at only $35 with proceeds going to an LGBT nonprofit. Matt Lee is a web producer for Metro New York. He writes about almost everything and anything.

Bayard Rustin was the organizer of the March on Washington and one of the leaders of the civil rights movement. In the 1980s Bayard adopted his younger boyfriend Walter Naegle to obtain the legal protections of marriage. In this intimate love story, Walter remembers Bayard and a time when gay marriage was inconceivable. He reflects on the little known phenomena of intergenerational gay adoption and its connection to the civil rights movement.
The first verse is essentially nonsense. The repeated call for a supernatural being to somehow extend his powers of unworldly protection over our hereditary ruler would be laughed at were they sung by a group of tribesman in the rainforest. That these words are still venerated by people in one of the most scientifically advanced nations in the world is bizarre.
A pass from Tennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano was batted down by South Carolina defensive lineman D.J. Wonnum, a play that was ruled to take just three seconds. That let the Vols try one last pass — also incomplete — before time ran out.
Johnson could provide a complement to left-handed-hitting first baseman Justin Bour, Jackson suggests. He's spent most of his career at third base, of course, and would boost the team's depth there as well, though starter Martin Prado and utility option Derek Dietrich are already in place.
"We are excited to welcome Brady and Laura Hoke to the football family. We feel extremely fortunate to get someone of Coach Hoke's caliber that will continue to develop our defensive linemen while also providing expertise and experience to all of our players and coaching staff. He has an extensive track record of success as a head coach and on the defensive side of the ball. He will be a great fit to our entire organization."
Democratic Assemblyman Tim Eustace called Christie's "failure to act is incomprehensible," and accused him of boosting his presidential campaign at the expense of N.J. citizens.
This is juxtaposed with Dirk, who is now apparently literally The Doctor from Doctor Who. The manic pixie British boy archetype is too far removed from what the original Dirk Gently was, in both the books and the previous (unrelated) TV series, to make it comfortable. It doesn't help that Samuel Barnett's interpretation of the token BBC fangirl guy takes a bit of getting used to before giving him a chance. He's actually quite annoying in the first episode – the moment he pops through the window you're almost wanting to change the figurative channel, and by the end of the first episode, you're bound to want to swallow a cyanide pill. I'm not railing against the actor, just the character that Dirk Gently is written as. There are some awkward performances from some of the actors; the characters of Farah, Amanda and the guy who keeps shooting people for no reason (you'll see) feel like they could use some polish.
Other groups also are objecting to the arrests. Congressman Keith Ellison and Minneapolis City Council Members Alondra Cano and Andrew Johnson have made public statements supporting the right of peaceful protest and encouraging dialogue around Minnesota's racial inequalities.
Foster's mother, Kristina Young, waited for hours outside the small, tan house in the city's northeast side while investigators gathered evidence. She said she wasn't going to leave until the body of her daughter was taken away.

She said a friend later called to say Foster had been shot.

One of the few defensive standouts for the Lions, these underclassmen has versatility on his side. He lines up in the middle or on the edge at linebacker and makes plays against both the pass and the run. Though undersized at 6-foot, 185 pounds, he simply makes plays. A tackle for loss was among his four recorded stops.
"When he has the puck he's unbelievable," said defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, one of three players on Sweden's World Cup team who also played with Forsberg in the 2015 World Championship. "If he keeps playing like he's playing he's going to be a superstar in the NHL."
That's going to be a job for Team Europe defenseman Roman Josi Sunday. It's an obvious change of pace for Josi, who plays with Forsberg in Nashville and, like Team Sweden's players, mentions Forsberg's shot first when he's asked about him.
"I totally see it," said defenseman Mattias Ekholm, who also plays with Forsberg in Nashville. "When he gets the puck it's like that (snaps fingers), and then he scores a goal. His shot is amazing. Goalies just can't seem to stop the puck. That's the case with Ovi too."
Michigan Congressman Justin Amash, a 34-year-old Republican, has lots of opinions.
Just last week, the congressman tweeted out a mock Beatles' album cover that replaced the portraits of the Fab Four with those of Ron Paul, Rand Paul, and himself. (If you don't recognize the squinting, bespectacled lad in the bottom right, that's Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie, an enthusiastic libertarian foot soldier.)
“Justin is much more effective now than he was just two years ago,” said Republican Congressman Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina. “He's doing better and is starting to understand that not everything is worth shipwrecking things over.”
Girardi had been livid after umpires did not rule Houston's Carlos Correa out in the eighth inning, when Correa ran on the grass after a grounder, obstructing the view of pitcher Dellin Betances, who tossed the ball high over the head of first baseman Mark Teixeira. That allowed the go-ahead run to score in the Astros' 5-3 victory.
“Our feeling was that the rule is stated that it's in the umpire's judgment if the first baseman can catch it,” Girardi said, adding later: “Maybe it's something that we have to think about, in spring training, working on. You put a dummy out there, and if he's in your path and on the grass, you've got to throw it and hit him. Because if you try to do what Dellin did, it usually leads to what happened.”
An even more controversial play ended a game between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Tampa Bay Rays later Tuesday. As Toronto's Jose Bautista slid into second base in the ninth inning, he reached toward Rays second baseman Logan Forsythe, whose wild throw led to two runs and gave the Blue Jays the lead.
Northern Ireland's Police Ombudsman is due to publish his report into the alleged involvement of a priest in a 1972 IRA bombing in County Londonderry.
But whenever the first step of one of these business experiments is Fielder going immediately to Wikipedia, it immediately undercuts the self-imposed hierarchy that so many of these unscripted shows put into place. The first move we often see to get these plans in motion is hopping on Craigslist. Sure, shortly after that there's an army of set decorators and line producers ready to bring these ideas to fruition, but there's some truth in the everyman illusion.
Bob Brady: Philadelphia Congressman Bob Brady is basically in charge of the committee that's tryna make this happen. One of his main focuses now is trying to make sure that mayoral candidates are all-in in terms of working to fundraise if the DNC picks Philly. So far, he says he's been able to do that.
While the Vancouver sports media is happy to remind us that Gillis has yet to draft a player who has made a regular impact at the NHL level (aside from Cody Hodgson), those trends hint at a solid understanding of positional value, and development risk. Avoiding selecting defenseman early makes good sense: blueline prospects take longer to develop and are riskier picks. Never taking a goaltender in the first two rounds is a solid guiding philosophy as well, above average goaltending can usually be had for cheap on the open market, and projecting amateur goalies is completely impossible.
In terms of player size, the average forward drafted by Mike Gillis weighs 191 pounds at the Draft. The average Gillis drafted defenseman has weighed a paltry 187 pounds at the Draft (well below league average). That would indicate to me that Gillis hasn't looked to draft "heavy players" in particular during his tenure, but I also think there's more going on here.
Senior offensive lineman Aaron Evans, who roomed with DiNovo this offseason, said he hasn't spoken with him specifically about his motives for leaving practice but added, “I know he's going through some personal stuff and he's addressing that. I just really wish him the best with his future endeavors. I know he'll be successful.”
13 TERRIBLE: SUPERMAN
Whoa, Superman is on this list? Yup! Marvel and DC co-produced a one shot that paired up Superman with the Fantastic Four. Superman gets a holographic message from his father, Jor-El, blaming Galactus for the destruction of Krypton (we later find out that it was a manipulation by Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman). Superman goes to the Fantastic Four for information on Galactus when Big Purple abducts Superman and forces him to be his herald to find planets to consume.
Aware that the poet's remains had been scattered in an ossuary in 1946, Yeats's friends attempted to dissuade his widow, George, from going through with the repatriation. At the ceremony in Co Sligo the poet Louis MacNeice protested that the shiny new coffin transported by the Naval Service was more likely to contain “a Frenchman with a club foot”.
Since his 2013 acquittal, police have been called to several confrontations involving Zimmerman. They include a dispute with his estranged wife and his father-in-law about how to divide up belongings and an accusation by a girlfriend who accused him of threatening her with a gun.
The report states that Lyons was arrested and charged with domestic battery. It goes on to state that the arresting officer wrote in his report that Lyons' girlfriend suffered injuries to her face.
Hutton reiterated to the Globe that the police report was based on information given by Lyons' girlfriend, who was at the house at the time of the Jan. 14 incident. The attorney stated the friend of Lyons' girlfriend never witnessed anything getting physical. The police report, however, indicated that the situation included some verbal and physical confrontations.

Soon the space may not be as girly however, with Taylor's relationship getting very serious with boyfriend Calvin Harris - fortunately there is plenty of room for the DJ to move in if their romance heats up even more.
Far more grand is her beachfront home in Westerly, Rhode Island, which she bought for an estimated $17million in 2013. Last month Swift celebrated Independence Day there with a pack of famous friends, including her boyfriend Calvin Harris, pop star Ed Sheeran, models Gigi Hadid and Martha Hunt, Joe and Nick Jonas and the band Haim.
The defense as a whole seemed to win the day, with multiple players making an impact (including three interceptions, one by Cedric Thompson off McLeod Bethel-Thompson, one by Michael Thomas off Matt Moore, and one by Sammy Seamster off Bethel-Thompson), but it was Suh who stole the show. The first two days, Suh seemed to be holding back and not wanting to go full speed without pads. Saturday, that changed, with the big man abusing offensive linemen all day, constantly pushing back the line of scrimmage.

Edith, Hellrider, and Dadmonster pose for a photograph. In Botswana, heavy metal music has landed. Metal groups are now performing in nightclubs, concerts, festivals. The ranks of their fans have expanded dramatically. These fans wear black leather pants and jackets, studded belts, boots and cowboy hats. On their t-shirts stand out skulls, obscenities, historical covers of hard-rock groups popular in the seventies and eighties, such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, and AC/DC. They have created their own style, inspired by classic metal symbolism, but also borrowing heavily from the iconography of western films and the traditional rural world of Botswana. Their nicknames, Gunsmoke, Rockfather, Carrott Warmachine, Hellrider, Hardcore, Dignified Queen, may appear subversive and disturbing as their clothing, but they are peaceful and gentle. “We like to get dressed,, drink meet friends and feel free , this music is so powerful . We are lucky to live in a country tolerant and open” argues one of the leaders. A precious rarity for Africa.
If you and your spouse are accosted by this wandering menace, do not attempt to confront or drive away the prime minister; simply continue to take pictures, act like it's a big deal that he's there, and upload the photos until they've gone viral enough to slake his unholy thirst – at which point he should transform back into a statesman and wander away into the woods, at least for the time being.
The committee report made 21 recommendations, including an overhaul of privacy policy, and comes after the Commonwealth ombudsman found the program was treating some clients unfairly.
In an interview with Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1, Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner said that the album title was inspired by the Velvet Underground's 1985 compilation album VU: "I actually stole it from the Velvet Underground, I'll just confess that now and get it out of the way. The 'VU' record, obviously." He went on to say: "Did we cop out? Yeah! Summat about it feels like this record is exactly where we should be right now. So it felt right to just initial it."[5]
The prosecution at the trial in Neryungri in the Sakha Republic alleged Gorulenko beat Korochkin, who died three days later, and said Abdullaev admitted the two fishermen then dismembered, cooked and ate the man's corpse. The court heard they carried his body with them as they sought to escape their frozen hell.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a letter in absentia to the Senate panel that virtual currencies "may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure, and more efficient payment system."
Chairman Alan Boldock said it would be the biggest drone event ever staged in the state.
For September 20, 2017 the tour moves to the Cathedral St. Joseph the Workman in the Diocese of La Crosse. Besides veneration, there will be two Masses that day, one celebrated by Bishop William Callahan.
Already problems have arisen, Yacoub said, with militiamen following Christian women in the streets, driving around playing their religious music at top volume and marching through the town beating their chests during the religious procession of Arbaeen, the yearly remembrance of the martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson. “It is disrespectful of the Christian people!”
Chairman Tony Fernandes has vowed to fight any fiscal punishment and discussions between the two parties ‘remain ongoing', as they have been for months.
JR: Eric and Peter Criss supposedly had a very close friendship. Can you describe what their relationship was like and the mutual respect they had for each other throughout the years? There's that famous picture of the 2 of them backstage at Radio City Music Hall in 1984 on the Lick It Up tour…do you know how often they got to see each other? Do you know what Peter thought about Eric's thunderous drumming? LC: Eric always thought of Peter as the first KISS drummer; he respected him very much and Peter was a perfect gentleman to Eric. They spoke many times. A lot of times when Eric was not feeling well, Peter was always there to help him. I do speak to Peter and GiGi from time to time and they are very kind and always have great thoughts of Eric.
Lamar Hunt, who died in 2006, might have been the greatest sportsman of the 20th century. He founded more leagues than Jules Verne, but his importance goes well beyond mere financing. He was the father of the modern idea of parity, a proponent of recruiting African-American football players and a key figure in the AFL-NFL merger. He was also the creator of World Championship Tennis, which fed the tennis boom of the 1970s and provided the framework for the ATP Tour.
With this in mind, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Tuesday of the potential for renewed demands for higher wages by American workers if prices continue to increase. In his biannual monetary policy report, delivered to both houses of Congress, the Fed Chairman stressed the Fed's continuing commitment to quelling any wages movement.
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, in his comments on Bernanke's testimony Wednesday, warned his corporate backers to this effect. After affirming that the existence of rising social inequality is “no longer a matter debate,” he noted that, “If the numbers of unemployment in the second half of this year are not better than that for the first half, we are on track to lose one million jobs this year.”
Why would a clinician ever think a feminine male child might grow up to be a gay man rather than a straight woman? The data we have indicates that a large percentage of boys who act statistically more “feminine” as children—who dress up in girlish clothing, prefer social role-play games to contact sports, are highly attentive to their mothers and aunts, and feel budding sexual attraction towards male—will end up not as transgender women, but as gay men, at least in our culture. Only a small number will grow up to be straight transgender women.
Weir told authorities that she gave her consent for the children's tattoos, the designs of which she knew. She wouldn't tell investigators who actually committed the act, but she did say that the only adults who were around at the time were her, her boyfriend and her boyfriend's brother, whom the children had implicated.
Atletico Madrid striker Borja is due in South Wales over the next 24 hours to complete a medical and put pen to paper on a deal that will see him link up with Spanish World Cup winning frontman Fernando Llorente in Francesco Guidolin's squad.
Journalist Simon (37), from Dublin says sex is an important de-stresser for him. "I'd probably have sex with my girlfriend about three times a week," he says. "After a hard day at work there's nothing better to get rid of the day's anxieties. Sometimes it's long and sensual, other times it's a bit more wham, bam, thank you ma'am -- but it's always great!"
The defense didn't meet expectations, but the truth is 2015 was a rebuilding year for that unit. Malik Jefferson earned Big 12 Defensive Freshman of the Year honors and led a group of freshmen who ended up playing a ton of snaps. The youth movement makes for a promising future -- those rookies played a big role in Texas' upset of Baylor -- but also present-day unpredictability. Texas had some nice pieces, but its issues started up front with a defensive line that never emerged as a strength.
Erie County GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy said he was surprised by the announcement. But he said there's likely more to the story.
Erie County Democratic Committee Chairman Jeremy Zellner said the party two weeks ago endorsed Panepinto to run again in November.
Over time I established a system: the more harm someone was doing to others, the greater the priority. Reporting about violent criminals such as guys hitting their girlfriends is pretty easy on the conscience, and so are DUIs and endangerment.
The Buckeyes gain their second pure defensive end in the class with a 6-foot-5, 238 pound edge rusher that set New Jersey records in his senior year with 23 quarterback sacks. Slade's cousin, former Penn State defensive lineman Jared Odrick, played for new Buckeye defensive line coach Larry Johnson, Sr., and it was that relationship which turned Slade's interest from the Buckeyes into something to look closely at.
1. Up-the-middle strength. How many teams have two middle infielders and a catcher capable of hitting twenty home runs? We are as strong up the middle as any team in the division. That is the hardest part of building a contender. Compared to that, finding a left fielder and a first baseman should be easy.
Given Shepard's prior work as a Ashton-Kutcher's jokester sideman on MTV's Punk'd, and more recent comedic roles in films like Hit and Run, it's hard to imagine the new CHiPs film as anything other than a raucous, joke-filled tear across the tarmac of Los Angeles — and if that turns out to be the case, that's just fine with us. If the film can tread the same line of hilarity and nostalgia as the similarly stylized '70s reboot of Starsky and Hutch from Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson (an under-rated film in our book), it could be a pretty fun ride.
It's not until when Ryder hits rock bottom, that he realizes the true girl of his dreams Erica has been there all along, the problem is she's the girlfriend of one of his good buddies. Ryder and Erica have been friends since they were 9, so they couldn't possibly be right for one another...or could they?
In a 2007 speech, Sen. Obama said, “Keeping faith with those who serve must always be a core American value and a cornerstone of American patriotism. Because America's commitment to its servicemen and women begins at enlistment, and it must never end.”
More recently, House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla., wrote a letter to Obama on May 21, 2013, that warned: “an alarming pattern of serious and significant patient care issues at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) across the country … (including) failures, deceptions, and lack of accountability permeating VA's healthcare system … I believe your direct involvement and leadership is required.”
Republicans with national stature have been lining up to endorse Walker: Mr. Romney in April declared him a "hero"; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal have joined Walker on the campaign trail; and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus described the governor as the "anti-Barack Obama," predicting that his reelection will help the GOP "pounce on the president and other Democrats on the ballot with him in November."
At time of writing, Obama had yet to comment on the race, and the Wisconsin Democratic Party has asked for – but not received – $500,000 from the Democratic National Committee to help with field operations. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, however, sent a fundraising e-mail Wednesday to millions of party supporters seeking solicitations on Barrett's behalf.
Notre Dame offensive lineman Matt Hegarty (77) watches a field goal attempt during a 2013 game against Brigham Young. Hegarty will join the Oregon Ducks this fall, the program announced in May.
Hegarty, the former Notre Dame offensive lineman who transferred to Oregon and can play immediately this fall as a graduate student with remaining eligibility, began that very route on Saturday morning. By afternoon he was somewhere in Utah, his vehicle loaded with his belongings -- not to mention his 6-foot-4, 295-pound frame -- yet wasn't complaining about the one-man endurance test before him.
But long before he became a highly sought-after de facto recruit this spring, Hegarty was a prep lineman largely clueless about the recruiting process living in a 6,000-person town in northwestern New Mexico -- three hours to Albuquerque, and seven each way to Denver and Phoenix. It was far enough off the beaten path that even a seasoned recruiter might have had to call up Google Maps himself. Still, Oregon was first to invite him to a summer camp after his sophomore year.
Count his latest trip to Eugene as a confident bet that this is the perfect way to finish his college career. Six years after he was introduced to major college football, and three months after he was a lineman without a team, 19 hours in a car doesn't seem so bad.
“My dad was very concerned because my penmanship was horrible in contrast to my drawings. My mom loves to tell stories. She's the natural storyteller in the family. She can hold court in any gathering for hours on end about family.”
One of the more positive things to come out of losing the Rams to LA for Saint-Louis was without a doubt the fact that they no longer had to sit through a 3-hour football game featuring Greg Robinson attempt to be done his best impression of an offensive lineman in the NFL. While Justin Gilbert may have been about as effective and menacing as Casper the Friendly Ghost out on the football field, at least he played 36 games which is more than the 16-game length of an NFL season. As you'll find out shortly if you don't already know, you sure can't say that about every 2014 Browns First Round Pick! To be honest it's hard to keep thinking of different ways to express that the Cleveland Browns are in fact bad at drafting talented football players so I'm just going to move on to another team.
NEW DELHI: Nearly 20 major US companies like Boeing , Pratt & Whitney, Merck Medtronic and Cargill are heading to Uttar Pradesh next week to explore investment opportunities in the state with the new BJP government headed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath . The delegation, visiting under the aegis of US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), will be interacting with UP Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh and the chief minister on Monday in Lucknow.USISPF in a statement to ET said UP's demographic dividend forming the largest consumer base of 200 million in the country and investment incentives offered by the state under the new chief minister “translates into a business-friendly climate for industry.”Officials from the US Embassy and US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will also be a part of the delegation led by the Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar. Others in the delegation include Azure Power CEO, Inderpreet Wadhwa, Cargill India Chairman Siraj Chaudhary as well as executives from Facebook Honeywell , P&G, Oracle and GE Health UP Chief Secretary Rajive Kumar will brief the delegation on investment opportunities along with the UP Industries Development commissioner and principal secretary for industries. UP has recently come up with an Industrial Investment & Employment Promotion Policy to create a framework to stabilize and make existing industries more competitive and to attract and realize new international and national investments in the industrial sector.A session on healthcare has also been organised to help US companies like Merck Sharp & Dhone Corp (MSD), GE Healthcare and Medtronic to focus on initiatives, programs and best practices to overcome roadblocks to greater access and affordability for health care services in UP. Executives from Mastercard, Azure Power, Cargill and Pratt & Whitney will also discuss technology, innovation and entrepreneurship opportunities with UP functionaries.USISPF along with UC Berkeley will launch its first co-innovation laboratory in Allahabad, which has been identified under the 100 smart cities mission. The co-Innovation lab initiative will provide local solutions to local problems by roping in young innovators and startups primarily in the areas of energy, transportation, waste management, healthcare, artificial intelligence, climate and smart agriculture, the USISPF said.
And now, reviews of the police files for the case paint a far more complex picture of what Rebecca was dealing with – including family problems with her mother, stepfather, and father; a history of self-cutting, and a breakup with an Internet boyfriend just before her suicide. The reviews of the police files also reveal little evidence of the online bullying that Judd said was so pervasive.
It reveals conflicts with other students at her school – from which she withdrew in February 2013 – both around a boyfriend and students calling her a “liar.” That label was apparently due to an abuse report that she filed against her mother, which was later judged to be false. Rebecca was also cutting herself – something she attributed to bullying in February.
“Arguments and disagreements over a boyfriend is teen drama; it's not bullying,” she adds, noting that “by the time police officers started doing all the questioning at school, all of the news media was out there saying Rebecca was being bullied, so that's the language the students were using.”
The "Paleolithic Diet" has come in and out of fashion since the 1970s. Its adherents eat mostly grilled meat, fish, fruit, vegetables and nuts—supposedly the only foods available to our ancient ancestors. But new research suggests that cavemen indulged in richer fare as well, at least when such victuals had a ritual significance.
A group of archeologists finds the remains of a 7700-year-old aurochs barbecue by a river in the Netherlands. (Aurochs are horned ancestors of the domesticated cow; they've been extinct for 400 years.) Analysis of the remains revealed a complex set of rituals surrounding the caveman meal. The group of hunters that caught and killed the aurochs (using a flint ax) first sucked the fatty marrow from the aurochs' bones, then grilled the beast's ribs at the site of the killing. They brought the rest of the meat—scraped scrupulously from the bones—back to their settlement.
Renewable Electricity Standard legislation has bipartisan support and is being pushed by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat, as a measure that could demonstrate Congress' ability to do something for the environment, even with more Republican lawmakers.
He walks into a classroom filled with two dozen or so incoming freshmen in the Millennium Scholars program, for students committed to pursuing a doctoral program in science or engineering. They eat pepperoni pizza and pepper Urschel with questions.
We already had an FBI director who engaged in political gamesmanship and consistently abused his power. His name was J. Edgar Hoover and he kept files and recordings on the Kennedys, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and anyone he viewed as going against his personal ideology and concept of America.
Obama's infatuation with the deadly drone program is a part of this disengagement. Drones require far less of a commitment of money, manpower and equipment than the ground forces favored by the neoconservatives. It allows Obama to pursue armed groups in remote places at a much lower cost and risk to the US and its soldiers. That the drones are routinely killing civilians and thus doing the same job of enflaming Muslim feelings against the United States, creating more of the same fanatical fighters we're ostensibly trying to eliminate, demonstrates that the strategy is not about promoting peace and human rights. It's about being able to continue waging war, at a lower cost. That is, to the United States, not our purported adversaries, obviously.
Brooks's law: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
After climbing behind the wheel of the pricey sports car, Kelly allegedly picked up his girlfriend and took her to dinner, police said.
Kelly was arrested, while his girlfriend was released, the release said.
“There was a moment in the Sunday meeting that just literally about cleared the table. A gentleman my fellow coworkers call Rambo went to the mic. He wanted a show of hands [from the local officials] on who was voting for this contract and the reaction was hilarious. They looked around at each other like school kids. ‘You raise your hand and I will.' They all did (bargaining committee only), the other people on the board would not raise their hands because they knew it was a crap deal. The worst part was they felt threatened by what our union brother did and sent the guards on him. That was low.”
Madison County Commissioner Mo Brooks (R) said Tuesday afternoon that he won't be clearing out of the GOP primary in Alabama's 5th district to make way for Rep. Parker Griffith, who announced earlier in the day that he was switching parties and joining the Republican Conference. Brooks also warned the Congressman that his party switching ways will not go over well with GOP primary voters, who make up the vast majority of the 48 percent of the 5th district electorate that voted against Griffith in the 2008 general election. "That's a tough jury to sell, particularly when you've voted with [Speaker] Nancy Pelosi [D-Calif.] 85 percent of the time," Brooks said. "It's unbelievably good fortune that Parker Griffith would jump into our pool and want to play. ... He has just propelled us to favored candidate status."
Cuban acknowledged that the timing of his decision on West would be influenced by Monday's deadline to trim the roster to 15 players. The Mavs' roster currently stands at 18 after they claimed center Eddy Curry off of waivers and signed swingman Chris Douglas-Roberts and center/forward Melvin Ely to nonguaranteed contracts.
"It's clear that porn is having an effect," says one. "I mean, when a guy asks to come in your hair, he's not thought that up by himself. He's got that from somewhere." Last year, HBO's Girls, a series followed by its young female audience with a kind of religious fervour, contained a scene where the male character has his girlfriend crawl along the floor, before he ejaculated on her back. "Been there," said a friend, while watching it.
Here is why we need sex education: we need sex education because (some) men are asking for anal sex on the first date. This is fact. If you do not believe it, then I'm afraid, you simply haven't spoken to enough women in their 20s. We need sex education, because (some) men seem to think sex ends with him ejaculating on your breasts, or in your hair, or in your face. We need sex education because of a practice called "seagulling", a boarding school import (what else?) that has spread to some university halls of residence. It involves a group of guys standing outside a mate's door while he has sex with a girl, and then bursting in and ejaculating over her, all at once. We need sex education because women are telling me they're fed up of being told they're a "bitch" or a "dirty little whore" or a "slut" in bed. That they need to be "violated" or "ruined". We need sex education because I have lost count of the number of times that young women have told me that their boyfriend or sex partner has placed his hands around their neck and tried to choke them during sex.
"The computer security at cowboys casino was non-existent and all data was ripe for the taking," read a note on the site. "We asked cowboys casino to fix the [gaping] holes in their system but our request was ignored for over a year."
"It's not just Cowboys Casino that's had the issue, it's a pretty widespread problem — not just in our industry, but in a lot of industries," he said.
“Joe Thomas is incredible. The biggest thing about him is his consistency. Maybe that's not a tough-guy term, but it's what a good offensive lineman has to have. There's a right way to do your footwork, and that's the way he does it every time. He doesn't necessarily have a powerful build, but he's got plenty of size and strength, and he knows exactly how to use it. You won't find anybody better and more consistent at protecting the passer. He's no mauler as a run blocker, but he doesn't need to be because he knows how to move people and get the job done. He's as good as it gets.”
Horton likes to move his linemen around and create mismatches, and he will have all of his starters ready to play any of the three spots. Free-agent pickup Desmond Bryant (6-6, 310) was a 4-3 tackle in Oakland, but he has an ideal build to blossom as a 3-4 end and the athleticism to cover in certain situations.
Mr. Haden's knowledge of this issue was not learned in school or from reading a story in the newspaper. It hit him in the gut on June 7, 2008, when he could not reach his younger brother, with whom he was supposed to be having dinner. He went to his brother's three-storey stucco walk-up apartment in Kitsilano with his girlfriend to look for him.
Indeed, to anyone who caught Tame Impala at any one of their hundreds of shows this year, it was clear to see Kevin shedding that reclusive image night after night. Finally owning up to being the band's sole studio member around the time ‘Currents' came to light, his on-stage persona soon followed suit. Grabbing the frontman role with both hands, he uprooted his gaze and bare feet from his guitar pedals, hopping, skipping and dad dancing about evermore-massive stages, revelling in cannon-after-cannon of confetti. Tame Impala's one-man-band studio guise was borne of necessity, not narcissism, he explains. Obsessed with writing and recording since his pre-teen years, the lack of friends with a similarly musical mindset left him in the lurch. Rather than wait around for these mates to swap playtime for practise, he took everything on himself. “I was like, ‘Oh, I guess I've gotta do everything',” he smirks. “As an artist I've just grown up with that way of doing it, to the point where if I had to work with someone else on Tame Impala stuff, it just wouldn't even be Tame Impala. There's no way I'd be able to conjure up the same emotions, and get inspired in the same way. I love making music with other people – since I've made music with friends, I've loved collaborating and stuff – but it's just not what Tame Impala is. To be able to access that part of myself, I have to be totally in my own zone and in my own head.” Times have changed, of course. “I'm part of an extremely creatively driven group of friends, and we're all kinda the same – making music is our lifeblood,” he states proudly today, those long and lonesome studio days far behind him. “We're never really content just to be doing one thing.”
Spokeswoman Lisa Chalk says a television campaign starting next week will replace the bags.
Sean John Clothing succeeded by winning over two distinct realms of the apparel industry. The company's runway shows were extravagant affairs attended by celebrities and the arbiters of what was high-fashion and what was not. Combs's skills as a producer, promoter, and showman gave his company a decided edge in this area. In 2001, for instance, Sean John Clothing made fashion history when it became the first designer to have its runway show broadcast live on television, a two-hour event simulcast by the E! Style networks. On display at the company's runway events were showcase apparel items, pieces of clothing such as a $5,000 pair of rhinestone-studded jeans that were well beyond the apparel budgets of ordinary consumers. Sean John Clothing did not make its revenue by selling rhinestone-studded jeans or opulent furs, instead, the company's commercial success came from attracting ordinary consumers. The sale of the company's simple casual separates, leather jackets, and suit blazers provided the majority of its sales. Combs made his reputation on the runway, earning nominations for Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards for three consecutive years, but his company made its living on the streets.
But for one little gentleman named Randy at the St. Louis Language Immersion School, it's alive and well, and he's today's shining example of it.
Spokesmen for Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) offered no comment on Sunday.
We are a little bit late to the party in reviewing this camera and I must admit that one of the reasons to conduct that review (besides my genuine curiosity to see how different this camera is from my ageing Canon EOS 1D C), is the amount of email requests we got from fellow cameramen to test it. Judging by the amount of interest from our readers, it is no surprise that there is a big back order for the camera.
A Vegas showman with a poodle act was stabbed to death dozens of times in his trailer. His lover, a good looking drifter, was locked up for the crime. But it turns out he didn't do it and the story, being as Vegas as things go, has another twist. The prosecutors knew of the possibility of his innocence and tried him anyway. And still there's even more ― but you'll have to read the article to find out what happened next.
Beloved rockers My Morning Jacket kicked off a spring tour at the Criterion Music Hall in Oklahoma City, OK last night, on what happened to be frontman Jim James' birthday. The band played a potent mixture of songs new and old, treating fans to a heavy dose of tunes from The Waterfall while also busting out classics like “Circuital,” “Mahgeetah,” “Wordless Chorus” and more.
Following the barrage of Texas cliches, National Geographic adds that "there's excellent theater and jazz for the artsy crowd, too," suggesting that perhaps even in a city populated by rednecks, there are a few arts-loving (but probably cowboy hat-wearing) people here as well.
In another blow delivered to Trump's White House on Tuesday, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz has given White House chief of staff Reince Priebus two weeks to respond to questions about the administration's security practices following reports Monday that sensitive information was discussed while among Mar-a-Lago members.
Flynn, however, will likely stay in the headlines for a while. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker told reporters on Tuesday that Flynn may be asked to testify as part of a larger probe into Russia's alleged election-season hacking.
Recently suspended offensive lineman Richie Incognito was investigated last year for harassing a volunteer at the Miami Dolphins' annual golf tournament by allegedly molesting her with a golf club, according to Aventura, Fla., police.
The Sunlight Foundation's peerless CapitolWords.org shows that the usage of “feckless” has risen over the past year and a half. The member of Congress who's fondest of the word? By far it is Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R ) of Arizona, who along with his close friend Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is the chamber's most ardent hawk. Senator McCain has used it in connection with his old 2008 opponent's approach toward Russia, Syria and just in general when it comes to dealing with other nations.
WWE color commentator Jerry Lawler and his girlfriend Lauryn McBride were arrested on domestic violence charges early Friday morning by the Shelby County Sheriff's Office in Memphis, Tenn.
I think the Gilbert factor cannot be discounted. While John is an incredible player, Gilbert had an aura between about 2005-2007 that literally enraptured fans, media, everyone. He was a showman off the floor and a stone-cold competitor on it. John connects with fans and is even more concerned about his legacy as a player. But he hasn't become that persona nationally yet that Gilbert became.
Teneriffe murder-suicide: Police not responsible for Marcus Volke's death after he dismembered girlfriend
Nationwide, nearly $38 million was allocated to assist 5,269 homeless veterans, according to a HUD news release. Spokesman Brian Sullivan said there is approximately $22.4 million left in this year's budget. He anticipates that money will serve an additional 2,700 homeless veterans.
Support: Tottenham fans will face no action for chanting the word 'Yid' last weekend Only five days ago the FA said that 'use of the term in a public setting could amount to a criminal offence and leave fans liable to prosecution' but they confirmed today no action would be taken. Chairman of the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust Darren Alexander said: 'There was a degree of defiance on Saturday and that was always going to happen with the way that the FA has gone about this.
GALVESTON – A former state judge from Galveston County forced from office in 2013 was arrested Thursday and charged with two counts of online harassment for allegedly placing fake online ads indicating two former girlfriends were available for sex-for-hire, according to authorities and court documents.
Mohr's show was added on KBME last August as part of a daylong schedule shift that included the dismissal of morning hosts Matt Jackson and Adam Wexler. The station's morning shows hosted, respectively, by Lance Zierlein and Adam Clanton and by former NFL linemen Koch and Kalu, have shown improved ratings, but the Mohr show has been a ratings drag at midday and provided inadequate lead-in for the Thomas and Pallilo afternoon shows.
The Coalition's policy includes turning boats back to Indonesia, buying old boats from Indonesian fishermen and paying Indonesians to spy on people-smuggling operations.
Wives and girlfriends make sacrifices too. They have every right to speak their mind. After all, they do have one!
When a wife or girlfriend publicly defends her husband or partner, is that as demasculating as it gets? Something has to be said for loyalty, right?
The Cowboys' play calling appears to be the only job duty Garrett is in danger of losing at this time, even with Jones promising swift and sweeping adjustments. But the Ryan scapegoating may go down as a mistake, and it's already one that drew the ire of a couple Cowboys defenders.
The Communist Party has always had a surprisingly large role in Japan The protesters gathered in a park in the shadow of corporate headquarters skyscrapers, a short walk from Ginza, Tokyo's most upscale shopping district. Hundreds strong, they included workers already laid off as the global downturn battered Japan's economy, and those who feared they might be next. The demonstrators set off on a march towards Japan's Diet building - or parliament - carrying red flags. "I support the Communist Party because it's the one that thinks about workers first," said one man. "We're demonstrating to get better rights for the temporary workers," said another. "The Communist Party is the only party that gets really serious about problems like this." Fists in the air Lined up on a set of steps near the Diet, wearing suits, red sashes and beaming smiles were officials from the Japanese Communist Party. They joined the protesters chanting and raising their fists in the air. The Communist Party has always had a surprisingly large role in Japan, the world's second biggest economy. But while it had been fading towards irrelevance, now as the recession bites it is on the rise again. The party already has more than 400,000 members and people are joining at the rate of 1,000 a month. In comparison, the membership of the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest member of the governing coalition, is twice the size. But its numbers are declining. "Many people are beginning to think: 'Is Japanese capitalism OK as it is?'" said Akira Kasai, a Communist member of the Diet's House of Representatives. "Living standards are going down. The gap between rich and poor is growing." Lost generation Communist ideology has been spread in Japan in unusual ways. There was a book, Kanikosen - The Crab Factory Ship, which raced back up the bestsellers' lists. A classic tale of proletarian fishermen uniting to rise up against their bosses, it had been almost forgotten since it was written in 1929. Some new followers discovered Communism on the internet Publishers have also produced a manga, or comic, version of Das Kapital, Karl Marx's treatise on how capitalism would collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. One new Communist Party member we met in a restaurant found out about Marxism on the internet. "I got interested in Karl Marx a few years ago," she said. "In capitalism now we are controlled by the capitalists, or capital. But I think in communism society we can think about whole of the society and decide our economic activities in democratic way." The woman, 34, did not want to be identified for fear her employers, whom she claimed disapproved of the Communists, would find out. But she had told her family. "My parents were very surprised that I joined the party," she said. "They are not supporters of the Communist Party. They don't understand correctly, I think." The woman said she was a member of a "lost generation" - people who came into the employment market during Japan's long stagnation in the 1990s and could not find proper jobs. As the economy picked up at the start of this century, employers picked graduates untainted by years of drifting. Job insecurity Now Japan's economy, which relies for growth on sales abroad of cars, electronics and machinery, is struggling again. Exports have fallen by nearly half compared to a year ago, and industrial production has dived. The traditional Japanese dream of a job for life has been further undermined by reforms of the labour market in 2004 that allowed manufacturers to take on temporary workers. The first stage is to solve problems of labour and living standards according to people's demand
Two studies of Securities and Exchange Commission data published last month offer an illustration. A report by researchers at New York University and Cornerstone Research, a consulting firm, observed a steep slide in new enforcement actions against publicly traded companies and their subsidiaries during the first six months of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton's tenure. An analysis by Urska Velikonja, a law professor at Georgetown University, found a similar decline in new actions brought against public Wall Street financial firms and subsidiaries.
One of the words most often associated with perennial Four Horsemen enforcer Arn Anderson is "underrated." Whether in singles competition, or as part of the Tag Team Champions in WCW or the WWF, Anderson was a "wrestler's wrestler." Anderson, a thinking man's technician, would often isolate a body part before nailing his opponents, who were usually either bigger or faster, with a "AA" spinebuster or DDT. Always using great, quiet psychology, Arn was Ric Flair's rock, and the proto-Cerebral Assassin.

At No. 5, the Vancouver Canucks stick with Portland Winterhawk Cody Glass, a centre whose development is reminiscent of Mark Scheifele at the same stage. There's no change from our last mock draft for the Winnipeg Jets, who should still take defenceman Juuso Valimaki with the 13th overall pick.
August 9th was the 20th anniversary of Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia passing away at the age of 53. To commemorate the man, let's remember the time his tour manager kicked John Kasich off the stage at a 1991 concert in Washington.
Congressman Kasich was in attendance, too. According to the AP, the 39-year-old Kasich was a guest that evening of opener Dwight Yoakam, who had allowed Kasich to be on stage during his performance. After Yoakam's set was over, Kasich hung out backstage and later attempted to hang out on the side of the stage during the Dead's set. However, presumably some time between "Wang Dang Doodle" and "Tennessee Jed," Kasich was spotted by the Dead's tour manager, Cameron Sears who told Kasich he could not be there.
Davis' ERA is 0.28, which looks like a rounding error from a normal pitchers' ERA. He has given up one run in 32 games, and that took a botched replay by umpires in New York and second baseman Omar Infante couldn't turn a double play. So, basically, Davis has not given up a run in innings where he asked to get fewer than five outs.
Part one of my new mini comic series.Ever wondered how this hostile little thief became Cinder fangirl number 1? Sure, Cinder did provide her with food, place to stay and a job but Em must've been skeptical of this beautiful stranger at first.To me, the dialogue in the flashback chapter hints that the two had already spent some time together before the" Follow me and you'll never be hungry again" happened.In this series we'll take a look at Emerald's first couple of days with Cinder before she actually decided to join her.Part two: tigerpaw90.deviantart.com/art/… I could've spent another day tweeking this comic and especially the dialogue and shading but after drawing the embroidery on Cinder's dress too many times,my brain exploded. I hate and love that dress so much. x'D It's so pretty, but such a pain to draw!EDIT: removed some unnecessary dialogue.

Unfortunately for liberal engineers, every system (including one of human beings) requires an external rather than internal operational template. Everyone must agree on what constitutes a default gateway as opposed to a subnet mask. And if I replace octets in the latter with girlish emojis because they make me feel pretty, then my expectations that this piece arrives for your indulgence should be tempered accordingly. The main provision, understood by every CCIE, is that personal whimsy does not replace system reality.
The victim had dropped his girlfriend off at her job at Famous Dave's, then gone to the drug meetup location in Long Reach, where Williams and Shird shot into the vehicle through the passenger side, officials said. There was reportedly another person in back of the vehicle at the time of the shooting.
This week, I started my sports department meeting with a monologue from The Young Pope about how I don't value friendly relationships. I hoped it would work as a joke because I consider myself to be friendly with all my writers. It was pretty clear it wasn't working out halfway through, but I hadn't transcribed the scene that morning to just quit. The stoic reaction seemed to indicate I might have been wrong about my own friendliness. I've stooped to the plain hurtful. After sending out acceptance emails to freshmen hoping to join the sports department, I took way too much glee in following up by telling them they received the wrong message and leaving them hanging for a few minutes. Sorry Leo.
Club Chairman Steve Parish said, “I would like to put on record our sincere gratitude for the tremendous service Alan has given us, both in his time here as Manager and previously as a player. Following a fantastic second half of 2014/15, the 2015/16 season culminated in only narrowly missing out on winning the FA cup as well as securing our Premier League place for a record breaking fourth time. During his tenure Alan's hard work and dedication were without question, he has improved so many areas of the Club and we wish him the very best for the future."
According to the project co-ordinator for Save Lamu, Omar Elmawi, said that some residents see through the gifts. “One time during a community meeting, a fisherman said that the freezers they were being given by Amu Power would one day be used as freezers in mortuaries due to death from effects of coal if they accept the project,” he said.
One of the best animated interludes in Marianne Heller's debut feature involves 15-year-old protagonist Minnie's vision of herself as an awkward giant stomping through San Francisco like Godzilla, plucking her boy prey from the streets and licking him all over. It's just one instance of how nascent female sexual desire is imaginatively captured by Heller. Her coming of age tale, set in the drug-hazed 1970s, doesn't flash teenage flesh gratuitously, only showing Minnie fully naked when examining her body in the mirror. Bel Powley's nuanced performance ensures that we get under the skin of this impulsive, fragile teen cartoonist rather than gazing at it. Minnie's affair with her mother's thirtysomething boyfriend (Aleksander Skarsgård) is also much more than a predatory one-dimensional relationship – just another example of the film's fidelity to its protagonist's POV. Sadly, the all-male panel of the BBFC, who don't often have many honest accounts of adolescent sexuality submitted to them, saw “strong sex scenes” rather than a lost, lonely girl looking for love, acting on her desires and getting confused between the two of them. They stamped the film with an 18 certificate, but hopefully that will only just encourage more teenagers to seek it out.
Nov. 6: The Rays will not make a qualifying offer to first baseman Logan Morrison, tweets MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Coming off a breakout 38-homer season, it certainly wouldn't have been a total shock to see Morrison receive the offer as well, and some clubs may well have taken that risk. However, the cost-conscious Rays likely couldn't stomach the notion of paying a combined $35MM for the pair in the unlikely event that both accepted the deal, so Morrison will enter free agency unencumbered by the burden of draft-pick compensation.
As expected, his very non-existent family popped up out of the woodwork once he died. Guess what they were after? Yep, money. We found it hilarious that they were looking for money as we helped his girlfriend of about a year plan his funeral. I absolutely refused to give them one single penny of the money that my co-workers had donated to help Raymond. Help to me extended into death since Raymond did not have life insurance and his family was unable to pay for a funeral. We, his coworkers, paid for his entire funeral from the coffin to the flowers. All his family had to do (after at least 10 phone calls asking about money, life insurance policies, jewelry, etc.) was show up.
In the U.S. military, a woman is more likely to be raped by a co-worker than killed by the enemy. The epidemic infects every branch of the armed services, includes female and male victims, and extends to the military academies, which reported that 520 cadets and midshipmen experienced unwanted sexual contact during the 2009-2010 academic year.
A more disturbing statistic speaks to the distrust that servicemen and women have in the military's ability to investigate and fairly prosecute alleged rapists and perpetrators of sexual assault. Only 13.5% of victims actually report the crimes.
In his 1907 autobiography, cowboy Nat Love recounts stories from his life on the frontier so cliché, they read like scenes from a John Wayne film. He describes Dodge City, Kansas, a town smattered with the romanticized institutions of the frontier: “a great many saloons, dance halls, and gambling houses, and very little of anything else.” He moved massive herds of cattle from one grazing area to another, drank with Billy the Kid and participated in shootouts with Native peoples defending their land on the trails. And when not, as he put it, “engaged in fighting Indians,” he amused himself with activities like “dare-devil riding, shooting, roping and such sports.”
Few images embody the spirit of the American West as well as the trailblazing, sharpshooting, horseback-riding cowboy of American lore. And though African-American cowboys don't play a part in the popular narrative, historians estimate that one in four cowboys were black.
The cowboy lifestyle came into its own in Texas, which had been cattle country since it was colonized by Spain in the 1500s. But cattle farming did not become the bountiful economic and cultural phenomenon recognized today until the late 1800s, when millions of cattle grazed in Texas.
“Right after the Civil War, being a cowboy was one of the few jobs open to men of color who wanted to not serve as elevator operators or delivery boys or other similar occupations,” says William Loren Katz, a scholar of African-American history and the author of 40 books on the topic, including The Black West.
Freed blacks skilled in herding cattle found themselves in even greater demand when ranchers began selling their livestock in northern states, where beef was nearly ten times more valuable than it was in cattle-inundated Texas. The lack of significant railroads in the state meant that enormous herds of cattle needed to be physically moved to shipping points in Kansas, Colorado and Missouri. Rounding up herds on horseback, cowboys traversed unforgiving trails fraught with harsh environmental conditions and attacks from Native Americans defending their lands.
African-American cowboys faced discrimination in the towns they passed through—they were barred from eating at certain restaurants or staying in certain hotels, for example—but within their crews, they found respect and a level of equality unknown to other African-Americans of the era.
Love recalled the camaraderie of cowboys with admiration. “A braver, truer set of men never lived than these wild sons of the plains whose home was in the saddle and their couch, mother earth, with the sky for a covering,” he wrote. “They were always ready to share their blanket and their last ration with a less fortunate fellow companion and always assisted each other in the many trying situations that were continually coming up in a cowboy's life.”
One of the few representations of black cowboys in mainstream entertainment is the fictional Josh Deets in Texas novelist Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove. A 1989 television miniseries based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel starred actor Danny Glover as Deets, an ex-slave turned cowboy who serves as a scout on a Texas-to-Montana cattle drive. Deets are inspired by real-life Bose Ikard, an African-American cowboy who worked on the Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving cattle drive in the late-19th century.
The cattle drives ended by the turn of the century. Railroads became a more prominent mode of transportation in the West, barbed wire was invented, and Native Americans were relegated to reservations, all of which decreased the need for cowboys on ranches. This left many cowboys, particularly African-Americans who could not easily purchase land, in a time of rough transition.
Love fell victim to the changing cattle industry and left his life on the wild frontier to become a Pullman porter for the Denver and Rio Grande railroad. “To us wild cowboys of the range, used to the wild and unrestricted life of the boundless plains, the new order of things did not appeal,” he recalled. “Many of us became disgusted and quit the wild life for the pursuits of our more civilized brother.”
Though opportunities to become a working cowboy were on the decline, the public's fascination with the cowboy lifestyle prevailed, making way for the popularity of Wild West shows and rodeos.
“He drew applause and admiration from young and old, cowboy to city slicker,” remarks Katz.
Seventy-six-year-old Cleo Hearn has been a professional cowboy since 1959. In 1970, he became the first African-American cowboy to win a calf-roping event at a major rodeo. He was also the first African-American to attend college on a rodeo scholarship. He's played a cowboy in commercials for Ford, Pepsi-Cola and Levi's, and was the first African-American to portray the iconic Marlboro Man. But being a black cowboy wasn't always easy—he recalls being barred from entering a rodeo in his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, when he was 16 years old because of his race.
“They used to not let black cowboys rope in front of the crowd,” says Roger Hardaway, a professor of history at Northwestern Oklahoma State University. “They had to rope after everybody went home or the next morning.”
In 1971, Hearn began producing rodeos for African-American cowboys. Today, his Cowboys of Color Rodeo recruits cowboys and cowgirls from diverse racial backgrounds. The touring rodeo features over 200 athletes who compete at several different rodeos throughout the year, including the well-known Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo.
Although Hearn aims to train young cowboys and cowgirls to enter the professional rodeo industry, his rodeo's goals are two-fold. “The theme of Cowboys of Color is let us educate you while we entertain you,” he explains. “Let us tell you the wonderful things blacks, Hispanics and Indians did for the settling of the West that history books have left out.”
Though the forces of modernization eventually pushed Love from the life he loved, he reflected on his time as a cowboy with endearment. He wrote that he would “ever cherish a fond and loving feeling for the old days on the range its exciting adventures, good horses, good and bad men, long venturesome rides, Indian fights and last but foremost the friends I have made and friends I have gained. I gloried in the danger, and the wild and free life of the plains, the new country I was continually traversing, and the many new scenes and incidents continually arising in the life of a rough rider.”
African-American cowboys may still be underrepresented in popular accounts of the West, but the work of scholars such as Katz and Hardaway and cowboys like Hearn keep the memories and undeniable contributions of the early African-American cowboys alive.

There's something disturbing about the fear that spending time with a boyfriend in a public place such as a park or a restaurant, or Skyping with a girlfriend, will inevitably lead to sin. Chastity, which the Catechism describes as “the successful integration of sexuality within the person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual being” (2337), is a form of temperance, the virtue that orders our appetites and desires. Given human concupiscence and how easy it is for us to misdirect our God-given desire for intimacy, it's understandable that temperance in romantic relationships and situations entails boundaries and restrictions.
The amendment, H.R. 2192, would eliminate an exemption for changes to Obamacare regulations that impact health insurance premiums and coverage. The proposed amendment would allow states to obtain waivers to repeal Obamacare regulations such as essential health benefits and community ratings. Congresswoman Martha McSally (R-AZ) sponsored H.R. 2192, which has 83 cosponsors—all of them Republican.
House Republicans look to attach the amendment to the American Health Care Act as part of their Obamacare repeal package. Obamacare required that Congressmen and their staff members purchase health insurance on the individual market. Congress received widespread criticism for exempting themselves from potential changes to Obamacare regulations that could raise costs and reduce coverage for Americans on the individual market.
"People who love Lululemon, myself included, obsessively study and monitor past and current trends," says the Lulu fangirl who blogs at Lululemon Expert and requested I not publish her name.

For some time I have wanted to have a go at book binding. It seems like a great thing to do as a gift for a loved one, but maybe that's just me. Well I decided to make my girlfriend a photo album and sketch book as a Christmas present. Hence why this is being published after Christmas to avoid her surprise being ruined. On the next occasion that I decide to make a book I would choose paper with a lower gsm that I have done for these. I selected 300 gsm, which is great for the photo album, however for the book it is a little too thick to easily flick the pages.
But as Edelman surmised, symbols mean different things to different people. It is especially ironic that for many the sight of the flag is a reminder of a fallen relative, shipped home in a body bag, interred with the flag folded by servicemen and handed to a grieving spouse. These people have a particularly personal relationship to the flag. For them, the personally relevant events outweigh the mass effect of the others—for one a brother or sister KIA, for another a legacy of chains. Others see in the flag the balance of the country's actions, so that for some, the war in which that relative died represents not a personal tragedy but a bloody imperialist conquest, of a nation in which slavery, genocide, and imperialism outweigh the rest of its behavior. Those who see a larger indictment of American history seem particularly invested in the personal tragedies of others, upon whom the curse of colonial aggression was visited without the slightest justification.

At some point, an altercation began at the bar and Dustin Diamond felt the need to protect both himself and his partner. Diamond apparently brandished a pocket knife he had on his person in an attempt to frighten off the assailant. There were also reports that Diamond's girlfriend was punched in the face, which helped to escalate the conflict, and Diamond's reaction. While originally attempting to scare away the troublemakers, his weapon eventually ended up harming a patron named Casey Smet.
For once, I don't think Dustin Diamond especially messed up here. While you should avoid stabbing people as a rule, a pocketknife isn't exactly a deadly weapon. Then again, if you had any level of celebrity, even Diamond's E-lister status, you should probably avoid physical altercations in bars. Just a thought. Looks like there's no saving Screech from the prison bell. After almost a year after the incident that landed him in hot water, actor Dustin Diamond will begin his short prison sentence in January.Last Christmas, Dustin Diamond reportedly had an altercation with a man at a local bar in Port Washington, Wisconsin. Diamond and his girlfriend, were attending a bar on Christmas Day of last year, when the other patrons apparently recognized Diamond for his work on Saved By The Bell . While some fans were taking pictures with Diamond and shaking his hand, apparently other guests of the bar grew increasingly annoyed and angered by Screech's presence.At some point, an altercation began at the bar and Dustin Diamond felt the need to protect both himself and his partner.

There were also reports that Diamond's girlfriend was punched in the face, which helped to escalate the conflict, and Diamond's reaction. While originally attempting to scare away the troublemakers, his weapon eventually ended up harming a patron named Casey Smet.Original rumors reported that Casey Smet has been killed by Dustin Diamond during the confrontation, which turned out to be false. Indeed, Smet said in his testimony that he didn't even realize he was cut until after the confrontation ended.Dustin Diamond has been convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, as well as disorderly conduct regarding this confrontation, and will be facing a four-month prison sentence for his crimes. Both of these charges are technically misdemeanors, and it is likely that, with good behavior, Diamond may not have to serve the duration of his penalty.The 38 year old actor first came into the spotlight with his performance as Screech in 90's sitcom Saved By The Bell. Screech was one of the most beloved characters in the series, with his nerdy and bumbling attempts at coolness, and the heart of fashionista Lisa capturing the hearts of the audience. Dustin Diamond would reprise his role in every incarnation of Saved By The Bell, including both spin-offs and made-for-tv movies . This was also a star-making moment for his co-stars who would all move on to less than ideal careers, with the exception being Mario Lopez.Saved By The Bell has proven to be Dustin Diamond's main claim to fame, which he would go onto utilize in whatever way possible. He wrote a semi-fictional memoir Behind The Bell which recounted fabricated experiences on the set of the sitcom, and was adapted for a TV movie. Additionally, he was billed as the star of an adult film called Screeched- Saved By The Smell, once again capitalizing on his following as a child actor. It turned out neither of these were his own work, as Diamond reported he used a ghostwriter and body double respectively.For once, I don't think Dustin Diamond especially messed up here. While you should avoid stabbing people as a rule, a pocketknife isn't exactly a deadly weapon. Then again, if you had any level of celebrity, even Diamond's E-lister status, you should probably avoid physical altercations in bars. Just a thought. Blended From Around The Web Facebook
Look at that infield and tell me the hair on your ass doesn't stand up with excitement. Longoria might be the one player TYE builds its entire roster around with his outstanding ability to hit for average and power. Ramirez is another player who can hit for average and drive in runs, all while swiping a fair amount of bases as well. It's hard to argue against Pedroia being TYE's starting second baseman given he's the reigning AL MVP and we're ecstatic to add his speed at the top of the lineup, too. TYE has options at first base in Fielder and Cabrera, the latter of which qualifies for the team because of his birthday (April 18, 1983). Depending on who gets the nod at first, the other can DH given that both players have a tremendous amount of power. Even though he's been hurt most of the real season and needs to work on not running into outs while on the base paths, we figure Reyes is a tremendous middle infield addition who has loads of speed and adds to the overall athleticism of the club. Don't forget that Cabrera can also play third base if Longoria needs a day off, so this club has options.
All else equal, these are precisely the questions that keep the Chairman up at night. The answers should present themselves quote soon.
It really just keeps getting worse as the show continues. MacDonald brings up, as “proof” that all these rape allegations are not valid, the fact that women sometimes have sex with their rapists after the assault, which only confirms how little she understands about perpetrators, victims, and rape culture. As all of us who have been paying attention and many women who have experienced sexual assault know, stranger rape is less common than acquaintance rape and yes, it's actually very likely that if you are raped by your husband or your boyfriend or a date, you may well have sex with that person in the future. This does not mean that the rape didn't happen. It means that rape happens all the fucking time and that it is very much a part of women's relationships with men. Women often stay with their abusers, too. Does that mean those women are not really being abused? Does it make the abuse her fault? FUCK NO.

As one of just five original cast members still on the show, the 31-year-old now serves as one of the elder statesmen on set. We spoke with Yeun to get his take on Glenn's recent dramatic developments, as well as what's to come in the March 29 finale.

Previous reports have documented an improvement in night vision among Jamaican fishermen after ingestion of a crude tincture of herbal cannabis, while two members of this group noted that Moroccan fishermen and mountain dwellers observe an analogous improvement after smoking kif, sifted Cannabis sativa mixed with tobacco (Nicotiana rustica). Field-testing of night vision has become possible with a portable device, the LKC Technologies Scotopic Sensitivity Tester-1 (SST-1). This study examines the results of double-blinded graduated THC administration 0-20 mg (as Marinol) versus placebo in one subject on measures of dark adaptometry and scotopic sensitivity. Analogous field studies were performed in Morocco with the SST-1 in three subjects before and after smoking kif. In both test situations, improvements in night vision measures were noted after THC or cannabis. It is believed that this effect is dose-dependent and cannabinoid-mediated at the retinal level. Further testing may assess possible clinical application of these results in retinitis pigmentosa or other conditions.
That college administrations are more concerned with news of rape getting out than rape happening is, sadly, not news — it's something that's led colleges to dangerously underreport instances of sexual assault time and time again. And, as IX activist Alexandra Brodsky pointed out in a Google hangout session with Congresswoman Jackie Speier yesterday, this is something that Obama's sexual assault task force and the Department of Education must stay mindful of:

“[F]or reasons that I don't and will never fully understand,” says Huckabee elsewhere, Trump got more votes than I did. That's butthurt Huck to the core, but I can sympathize with him a bit in this case. He's not blowing smoke when he says that he was ahead of the curve on Trump's agenda in certain key ways. Even in his first run for president in 2008, he pitched himself economically to the sort of centrist blue-collar Republicans that became Trump's base. That's how Romney ended up as his foil; I look like the sort of guy you work with, Huckabee once famously said, whereas Mitt looks like the sort of guy who laid you off. It's a fair question as to why Trump had so much more success with a big-government protectionist message this year than Huck did in either of his two campaigns. One possibility is that Huckabee never quite escaped his niche as a “Christian candidate” such that many of Trump's less religious “moderate” supporters never looked seriously at him. Same goes for Rick Santorum, another working-class Republican pigeonholed by his social conservatism. It took a less religious protectionist like Trump to build a working-class movement. Another possibility is that Trumpmania is less about working-class economics than it is about cultural resentments, which Trump taps into through his strongman appeal and his willingness to be “politically incorrect.” Huckabee will be politically incorrect too but in more familiar ways, like criticizing pro-choicers. Trump will get up there and ramble about “Mexican rapists” and banning Muslims from the country. If you're looking for a national savior who's going to impose his will on your cultural enemies, the billionaire who seems to enjoy scandalizing the political class is more captivating than the preacher turned professional politician who works hard to cultivate his media image as a nice guy (even though he really isn't).
The accident has tribal fisherman from Lummi Island, a traditional First Nations area on the U.S. side of the border, crying foul.
Carpenter said tribal fisherman Lucas Kinley caught 15 of the Atlantics about eight kilometres from Lummi.
If the symbolic moment of Game 2 was Ott patting Jason Zucker on the head, the symbolic moment of Game 3 might have been Zucker laughing in the face of St. Louis defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk, or Ott missing a check on Jonas Brodin and faking a punch at Matt Dumba, who was sitting on the bench. Dumba laughed as if he was watching Will Ferrell in an elf suit.
A couple of years ago, mechanical engineer Marc Meyers was sport fishing in Brazil and caught an arapaima. To catch one, fishermen waited until the fish comes up for air (arapaimas have lungs and need to breathe fresh air - another peculiarity about the species, but that's another story), then tossed a large hunk of meat as bait. If the arapaima missed the meat, the bait would only survive five minutes in the water before the piranhas get to it.
"I have raised this issue a number of times before and the Chairman of the CMC came to see me about it and we had a robust discussion about it. But what has happened today reinforces the view I have expressed before - it continues to happen."
By all reports, Benedict appears to be currently single although he was most recently romantically linked to English artist Anna James after splitting from his girlfriend of 12 years, Olivia Poulet.
Accurate timekeeping is essential on the battlefield. “You can track back a number of errors in war to timing,” said military historian Peter Doyle, author of The First World War in 100 Objects. But a pocket watch, however accurate it was, was somewhat unwieldy, especially as styles of warfare shifted from the Napoleonic – two armies facing off on a large field – to modern artillery-heavy, sometimes guerilla warfare. The first wristwatches designed for military use actually came in 1880: After one of his naval officers complained to his superiors that timing bombardments was too difficult with a pocket watch, Kaiser Wilhelm I commissioned Swiss watchmakers Girard-Perregaux to design and manufacture a watch mounted on a wrist strap. The Girard-Perregaux watches weren't terribly different from how wristwatches appear now, with the exception of the thick metal grill protecting the glass face. Though the wristwatches were indeed more practical in battle conditions, they weren't popular with men in the main and the design was discontinued. Roughly 20 years later, wristwatches were adopted by soldiers fighting in the Boer War in South Africa – some sported leather wrist straps into which a gentleman could put his pocket watch – but again, they didn't receive widespread attention. Even at the war's end in 1902, a redesign of the British officers' uniforms still came with a pocket for their pocket watch.
Similar accusations leveled by US officials have in the past drawn strong reactions from Iranian authorities. Early this month, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi advised US Defense Secretary James Mattis against making such "unwarranted and malicious accusations against Iran."
Universal's “Dracula Untold,” set for Oct.17, will draw the most attention. That's in part because of its $100 million budget and the pedigree of its producers — Legendary Pictures Chairman Thomas Tull and Sony's Mike DeLuca. The long-gestating thriller — it's been in development since 2007 — stars Luke Evans as the seminal bloodsucker.
Clinton made an enemy of the all-powerful NRA during her campaign. Once an organization dedicated to marksmanship and gun control, the NRA in the late 70s started to become intensely political. The organization spends large sums of money defending the Second Amendment, and it has essentially become an arm of the Republican Party in many ways. Unlike many liberals, Seifert and Solyanik don't abhor the organization.
That is what Congressman Dennis Kucinich proposed, when he declared last week that “Congress should be called back into session immediately to decide whether or not to authorize the United States' participation in a military strike. If it does not, the action of the President is contrary to [the] US Constitution. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution clearly states that the United States Congress has the power to declare war. The President does not. That was the Founders' intent.”
Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch said that a 15% corporate tax rate would be problematic because it would increase the deficit and run into parliamentary problems if Republicans try to pass their tax bill under a procedure that lets them avoid a filibuster.
Another group attempting to cultivate octopuses, Fremantle Octopus Company, is based in Perth, Australia. Instead of trying to bring octopus babies through their tenuous early stage, this company is starting out with underweight octopuses—mainly the common Sydney octopus (O. tetricus)—already caught by fishermen (they're calling their process "ocean to plate"). Their next hope is to move to a full life-cycle model.
So am I saying that… an evil conspiracy controls both television and government? No — we are both individuals, and our own rulers, and together we're deluding each other. Much as in business we sell each other products, or tell socially-acceptable lies to make other people do what we want, or even urge our girlfriends toward oral sex with selective quotes from famous actresses, we are swindling each other. We are each both producer and parasite, and the only conspiracy is our collective ignorance and willingness to manipulate others for our own convenience. Is television the devil? Like all things, technology enhances previously existing forces and multiplies their effect, so television is like “peer pressure” turned up 1,000% and is vastly effective. It turns us into passive toads who like queens utter a “yes” or “no” and imagine it means a difference, which for the short term it appears to.
"I wish to convey my most sincere apologizes for the wording of the section that covers alcohol to our staff members. It was written MANY, MANY years ago and should have been updated…. When I originally wrote that paragraph my intention was to ensure that there was no pressure put on our guides to consume alcohol with their guests when they were in fact responsible for the health and safety of the fishermen in their boat. After reading the paragraph in my trip planning guide I have to agree that, despite the fact that it was not intended to offend anyone, it could be taken in that context. I am in the process of removing the offending paragraph from my literature. I also would like to sincerely apologize to anyone that it may have offended."
Camus presents Sisyphus's ceaseless and pointless toil as a metaphor for modern lives spent working at futile jobs in factories and offices. "The workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious."

“It would be a huge breakthrough,” says Itskov. “The partnership could be different. Businessmen could probably give their name to the project, to save the history, and to have their own avatar once the [science has evolved].”
A former Cleveland police officer charged with rape, kidnapping and felonious assault for allegedly beating and sexually assaulting his girlfriend is on the run after breaking his GPS ankle monitor.
Griffin was arrested in January after his girlfriend said he entered her bedroom, attacked her, sexually assaulted her and fired two shots next to her. She also said he pointed the gun at her and struck her several times on her face with his hands and the gun. She was treated at a hospital for her injuries.

Between hospitalizations Bertha claimed she was seduced by a man named Gunther who schooled her in the art of “larceny from the person.” Despite her psychiatric problems, she was an excellent student. Not only was she good at getting the goods, she developed a unique approach to her profession, taking full advantage of her blond-haired, blue-eyed good looks and stylish appearance. Bertha would get into a crowd of people and swoon. The gallant gentleman who came to her rescue by catching her got a reward he wasn't expecting — his pockets were picked. It was done so adeptly that most didn't realize their loss until Bertha was long gone.
UPDATE, 8:45 p.m.: The Giants just announced that first baseman Brandon Belt's left thumb is broken. This is obviously a devastating injury that will keep the first baseman out for several weeks. This will be his second career stint on the disabled list.

Ri Sol Ju, the wife of Kim Jong-un, First Chairman of North Korea's Security Council, has not been seen in public since Japanese media reported that she was involved in a sex scandal. On the morning of October 6th, representatives from Blue Union and citizen's defense groups met at an observation platform at Yeoncheon in northern Gyeonggi Province to release balloons carrying news of Ri Sol Ju's sex scandal. The groups hoped that the balloons would scatter packages of pamphlets with descriptions of Ri's actions into the hands of North Korean citizens.

And some female entrepreneurs, with whom she's eager to align herself, aren't having any of her, either. Anne M. Mahlum is the CEO of the hugely successful Washington, D.C. chain of Solidcore gyms. When she found out that Ivanka Trump had worked out at one of her locations, Mahlum called her out on Facebook and demanded a meeting. She wants her gym to be inclusive and safe and wondered if Ivanka's presence might upset people, given her father's anti-women and anti-Muslim policies. “Her father is threatening the rights of many of my beloved clients and coaches,” Mahlum wrote, “and as a business owner, I take my responsibility to protect and fight for my people very seriously.”

By Walter W. Massie & Charles R. Underhill, 1908, pp. 67-71. M r. Nikola Tesla, in a recent interview by the authors, as to the future of the Wireless Art, volunteered the following statement which is herewith produced in his own words. "A mass in movement resists change of direction. So does the world oppose a new idea. It takes time to make up the minds to its value and importance. Ignorance, prejudice and inertia of the old retard its early progress. It is discredited by insincere exponents and selfish exploiters. It is attacked and condemned by its enemies. Eventually, though, all barriers are thrown down, and it spreads like fire. This will also prove true of the wireless art. "The practical applications of this revolutionary principle have only begun. So far they have been confined to the use of oscillations which are quickly damped out in their passage through the medium. Still, even this has commanded universal attention. What will be achieved by waves which do not diminish with distance, baffles comprehension. "It is difficult for a layman to grasp how an electric current can be propagated to distances of thousands of miles without diminution of intention. But it is simple after all. Distance is only a relative conception, a reflection in the mind of physical limitation. A view of electrical phenomena must be free of this delusive impression. However surprising, it is a fact that a sphere of the size of a little marble offers a greater impediment to the passage of a current than the whole earth. Every experiment, then, which can be performed with such a small sphere can likewise be carried out, and much more perfectly, with the immense globe on which we live. This is not merely a theory, but a truth established in numerous and carefully conducted experiments. When the earth is struck mechanically, as is the case in some powerful terrestrial upheaval, it vibrates like a bell, its period being measured in hours. When it is struck electrically, the charge oscillates, approximately, twelve times a second. By impressing upon it current waves of certain lengths, definitely related to its diameter, the globe is thrown into resonant vibration like a wire, stationary waves forming, the nodal and ventral regions of which can be located with mathematical precision. Owing to this fact and the spheroidal shape of the earth, numerous geodetical and other data, very accurate and of the greatest scientific and practical value, can be readily secured. Through the observation of these astonishing phenomena we shall soon be able to determine the exact diameter of the planet, its configuration and volume, the extent of its elevations and depressions, and to measure, with great precision and with nothing more than an electrical device, all terrestrial distances. In the densest fog or darkness of night, without a compass or other instruments of orientation, or a timepiece, it will be possible to guide a vessel along the shortest or orthodromic path, to instantly read the latitude and longitude, the hour, the distance from any point, and the true speed and direction of movement. By proper use of such disturbances a wave may be made to travel over the earth's surface with any velocity desired, and an electrical effect produced at any spot which can be selected at will and the geographical position of which can be closely ascertained from simple rules of trigonometry. "This mode of conveying electrical energy to a distance is not 'wireless' in the popular sense, but a transmission through a conductor, and one which is incomparably more perfect than any artificial one. All impediments of conduction arise from confinement of the electric and magnetic fluxes to narrow channels. The globe is free of such cramping and hinderment. It is an ideal conductor because of its immensity, isolation in space, and geometrical form. Its singleness is only an apparent limitation, for by impressing upon it numerous non-interfering vibrations, the flow of energy may be directed through any number of paths which, though bodily connected, are yet perfectly distinct and separate like ever so many cables. Any apparatus, then, which can be operated through one or more wires, at distances obviously limited, can likewise be worked without artificial conductors, and with the same facility and precision, at distances without limit other than that imposed by the physical dimensions of the globe. "It is intended to give practical demonstrations of these principles with the plant illustrated. As soon as completed, it will be possible for a businessman in New York to dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in the existing equipment. An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enable its bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the speech of a political leader, the address of an eminent man of science, or the sermon of an eloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however distant. In the same manner any picture, character, drawing, or print can be transferred from one to another place. Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plant of this kind. More important than all of this, however, will be the transmission of power, without wires, which will be shown on a scale large enough to carry conviction. These few indications will be sufficient to show that the wireless art offers greater possibilities than any invention or discovery heretofore made, and if the conditions are favorable, we can expect with certitude that in the next few years wonders will be wrought by its application."
With over 1000 days of continuous combat operations during three deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as over a decade of training and leadership as a U.S. Army infantryman, my experience can provide some insights lacking from the deadly shooting rampage in Las Vegas. I have qualified as an expert marksman with the military-issued variant of every confirmed weapon system utilized by Paddock to carry out his heinous assault, and I have instructed hundreds of American, Iraqi, and Afghan soldiers in the finer nuances of advanced rifle marksmanship.
Don't take my word for it, though. The U.S. Army field manual for rifle marksmanship states:
“Automatic or burst fire is inherently less accurate than semiautomatic fire. Trainers must consider the impact of recoil and the high cyclic rate of fire on the Soldier's ability to properly apply the fundamentals of marksmanship and other combat firing skills…”

At the time, Democratic state Sen. Marty Block said in an emailed statement that he “supports reasonable measures to add more transparency” to California politics, reported the local ABC affiliate. Republican Assemblyman Rocky Chávez dismissed the proposal, telling the ABC affiliate that "To have everyone decked out like race car drivers would be a circus element which wouldn't really benefit the public.”

This is where things get a bit nerdy. I've used Corsica's data from 2007-2016, looking at players with a minimum of 500 minutes at either 4v5 or 5v5. This gives us a sample of 190 Forwards & 191 Defensemen on the penalty kill, as well as 297 Forwards & 128 Defensemen on the power play. If you're wondering why those PP numbers look a bit weird, keep in mind that 4-forward PP units are becoming more common these days.

- After sitting out six of seven games as a healthy scratch, Martin Marincin made an impressive return to the Leafs' lineup Saturday afternoon in Vancouver. "He was big and he moved the puck and he was involved on the offensive blueline and didn't make a lot of mistakes," said Babcock. Marincin led all Leafs defenceman with a 74.19 Corsi For% against the Canucks. (Source: Corsica.hockey) "Marty's got a lot of talent, confidence is the biggest issue for him," Babcock said. "He's got to earn the right to be in every day. He played real good down the stretch for us last year. He's got to find that game on a consistent basis."
- Per Babcock, Matt Hunwick missed practice for maintenance. Last week, the veteran defenceman acknowledged that he's "still managing" issues related to the lower-body injury, which forced him to miss seven games earlier this season. Meanwhile, Matt Martin was sick on Monday and didn't join his teammates on the ice. Peter Holland, who didn't accompany the team on the Western Canada trip, was once again absent. Babcock didn't have any new information on his status.

Some guys will take the time to talk about their family life — girlfriends or wives — and maybe vent on that scenario, which can be good (or not so good). It's a forced bonding experience. Without the rain, everybody is so busy working that you don't really talk to each other outside of work duties. So in a way, it becomes kind of a group therapy session.
The main reason the media didn't show up was that the story was substantially untrue. As a later statement by the Pentagon clarified, a peaceful protest had taken place involving about 1,000 people—not the 7,000 Turkish police reported by Russian news outlets or the 10,000 cited by Twitter users. Officials at the air base had been warned of the protest in advance. The base was not “surrounded,” Turkish security focused on securing the visit of U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Joe Dunford to Incirlik the next day.
The daily business used to be Rs 1400 crore before the demonetization and now is less than Rs 200 crore said by the association of jewellers. However the jewellery exports now somehow stable. Last year, the annual gems and jewellery export was recorded to be $ 40 million and the similar figures also recorded this year also. Diamonds are the largest exports. Chairman of Gem and jewellery export Promotion council Praveen Shankar Pandya tells that because we receive payment from overseas, so there is negligible impact on the export business. Due to the liquidity crunch, there are chances that the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SME s) might have been affected. If payments (to artisans, workers) are made online or directly to bank accounts, there should not be a problem.

Created and written by Watkins, and marking the television debut of filmmaker Forster (World War Z), Hand of God stars Golden Globe winner Ron Perlman in his first lead television role since Sons Of Anarchy as the honorable Justice Pernell Harris. The show centers on Harris, a hard-living, law-bending married judge with a high-end call girl on the side, who suffers a mental breakdown and goes on a vigilante quest to find the rapist who tore his family apart. With no real evidence to go on, Pernell begins to rely on “visions” and “messages” he believes are being sent by God through Pernell's ventilator-bound son. Hand Of God also stars Dana Delany as the judge's protective wife Crystal Harris; Garret Dillahunt as KD, the born-again sociopath whose violent tendencies are exploited by Pernell; Andre Royo as the slick, smart, gregarious and greedy Mayor Robert “Bobo” Boston; Alona Tal as Pernell's grieving daughter-in-law Jocelyn Harris; Julian Morris as the questionable preacher Paul Curtis; Elizabeth McLaughlin as the preacher's sultry girlfriend Alicia; and Emayatzy Corinealdi as Pernell's call girl and confidante Tessie. Forster, Watkins, Perlman, Brian Wilkins and Jeff King are executive producers, and Jillian Kugler is co-executive producer.
At 11:15pm on Monday night, Justin Rice, 40, was arguing loudly with his girlfriend at Bushwick's HappyFun Hideaway, a neighborhood bar with many queer and trans staff and patrons. The bouncer kicked him out and Rice became violent, The New York Daily News and DNAinfo reports.
Amber Morgan was out cold behind the wheel on the 805 freeway in San Diego just before 1 a.m. Friday morning. An ABC 10 News cameraman discovered her at the scene and called 911, and even went out to her car in a futile attempt to wake her up by knocking on the driver's side window.
"I tried knocking—she's totally passed out. Her doors are locked on the driver's side," the cameraman says to the CHP officer who shows up.
But hiding behind a woman — especially one as anti-woman as Blackburn — isn't going to fool anybody. How can women trust a lawmaker who voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act? If you put lipstick on a sexist, she's still a sexist.
Most interesting, however, were Yorke's comments on YouTube. His venom toward Spotify is well documented, but it appears there's no love lost between the Radiohead frontman and the wildly popular video platform either. Asked how he discovers new music, Yorke responded, “Mostly with Boomkat … I certainly do not use YouTube.” He then noted his love for ad block, because it allows him to skip YouTube ads that he's not being fairly compensated for.
“I still hold on to a deep shame about my body. I never had a boyfriend throughout high school, and to this day I am very timid around men. I have remained in unhealthy relationships for way too long because I'm scared to say no. When more serious sexual advances have been made towards me, I have felt powerless to do anything. Sometimes, I flirt and smile and hope it stops. Or I force myself to be ‘ok' with it.”
Even though demand for cartilage pills may be quite small (in 2011, the total U.S. market was about $3 million, according to the Nutrition Business Journal), it's still another stressor for global shark populations. Merly explained that the cartilage industry adds value to shark carcasses, which, no matter how small the market may be, further incentives shark fishermen to increase their catch.
Board Trustees Chairman Joe Petrock said that 31 trustees confirmed DeVos invitation, and the school's primary concern is helping its students.
Lundqvist is the Rangers' best goalie and Nash their best natural scorer, but defenseman Ryan McDonagh may have established himself as New York's best all-round player. Before sustaining a shoulder injury on April 1 against the Canucks, McDonagh was enjoying a career year in which he emerged as a true franchise defenseman.
Teamed with Dan Girardi, McDonagh was tasked with shutting down the opposition's top scoring line every night. He also found his scoring touch both on the power play and at even strength. His 14 goals are the most by a Rangers defenseman since Brian Leetch scored 21 in 2000-01 and he led Rangers defensemen in every major statistical category, including goals, points, power-play points, shots and ice time.

That, of course, is exactly Erdoğan's objective. And if his repression seems far removed from the tactics of Trump, it's worth recalling that the president and the media that support him are even now promoting the manifestly false story that Hillary Clinton corruptly influenced the sale of a uranium company to Russia and are demanding a criminal investigation. No wonder Trump said as he met the Turkish strongman in September, "We're as close as we have ever been."
"Bringing wireless service into the New York City subway has been a big step forward for our customers, and we're pleased that even more of them will be able to take advantage of it," said MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas F.

Hence in a world filling up with saber-rattling and bad vibes, perhaps our best guarantee of peace is that major powers aren't familiar with any recent example of a successful war. While Genghis Khan or Julius Caesar would invade a foreign country at the drop of a hat, present-day strongmen talk loud but are very careful about actually launching wars. Of course, if somebody does find a formula to wage successful wars under twenty-first-century conditions, the gates of hell might open with a rush. This is what makes the Russian success in the Crimea a particularly frightening omen. Let's hope it remains an isolated example. Though, even if it is impossible to wage successful wars in the twenty-first century, that does not give us an absolute guarantee for peace. We should never underestimate human stupidity.

These rounds are very effective against body armor as well as increasing damage vs armored vehicles. Find yourself constantly loosing fights to someone with armored insert? Equip the AP Tracer Rounds and even the odds.
Democrats accused Republicans of using the Confederate flag ban reversal to assuage hard righters who would have preferred that the Interior bill dismantled the EPA entirely.

Google Voice is not an operating system, of course (Google already has its popular Android platform) but is part of Google's bid to provide a broad range of communications services to people through their cellphones or Gmail email accounts. As such, it is linked to the company's overall ambitions in the online search and advertising market as well as the mobile industry, which Chairman Eric Schmidt has previously described as a $10 billion a year opportunity.
DAVIS: Clinton can be a polarizing and unpopular figure for many Republican voters, but for many Republican lawmakers, she could be a critical partner to get things done. Former New York Republican Congressman Tom Reynolds credits Clinton with helping him bring home federal funds for a Buffalo medical campus and block an effort to close a Niagara Falls military base. These are the kind of things that don't draw national headlines, but it's that kind of work that builds respect in the halls of the U.S. Capitol.
These revisions were the result of Mayor Emanuel's directive to his financial, technology and legal teams to obtain the tools and strategic positioning necessary to effectively manage the contract.

The coloring pencils look EPIC and I am SO excited to use them in that AMAZING coloring book that you got me! Just flipping through it makes me excited! The little fox is SO CUTE! I have him sitting on my nightstand right now! And I got Snow White Themed posters in the mystery! I LOVE the Evil Queen! It's literally perfect that that's the posters I got in the mystery box! I don't know if I wrote it or not, but I LOVE TSUM TSUMS and I love turtles! And I am going to make the pop out dudes Halloween Night! And even though they are erasers, I plan on making some cool decorations using them (because who uses erasers as erasers?! Probably everybody but me but oh well!) Thank you Thank you!!!
In an Orwellian exercise in doublespeak, the authors of the text, including well-known proponents of abortion and population control like the UN's Jeffrey Sachs, make an attempt to conflate the bogeyman of extreme anthropogenic global warming with the very real problem of environmental pollution.
What do we see here? A handful of cossack's chevrons (of the Lugansk and All-Don cossack districts, unofficial paramilitary units based in both Russia and Ukraine), which are easily available in every market in Southern Russia. Cossack credentials (documents of the same sort, which are not officially accepted in Russia as valid for personal identification). 1 passport cover (on sale in any metro station in Moscow). Moreover, Russian servicemen do not have passports on hands. 1 military service card (any male Russian citizen liable to military service has such document regardless of his age). 1 driving licence issued in Moscow in 2010, name undisclosed (any Ukrainian who had a working permit in Russia could obtain it). And finally the jewel, the most imputing evidence – a token of the Federal Tax Police Service of the Russian Federation. Of course that means that all former officers of that service, dissolved in 2003, are sent to fight the Ukrainian army in the East with the old tokens in pockets!
One of the few points of pride I've claimed about my generation is that unlike our parents, we don't scare. We're not willing to throw our money and our soldiers to the flames simply because some oily politician tells us the big bad terrorist bogeymen will get us if we don't. I've said that we've been there. That we won't be fooled again.
Jeff Sessions is President Trump's nominee for attorney general, but until the Senate votes to confirm him to that post, he is still one of its 100 sitting members—he remains, in the politesse of the world's greatest deliberative body, “the gentleman from Alabama.” And as such, he is afforded a greater protection from insult than any of the president's other Cabinet nominees—even, in the case of Warren's words on Tuesday night, from accusations contained in a 30-year-old letter involving his conduct before he became a senator.
Trump booted the nation's top Latino newsman out of his press conference, but moments later he let Univision's Jorge Ramos reclaim his seat in the front row and the two men sparred passionately about illegal immigration.
Three of Arizona's goals came on the power play; defenseman Anthony DeAngelo capitalized on the team's first man advantage with a backdoor tap-in at 2:32 of the first period.
In the second, defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson made it 3-1 with a slap shot on the power play at 5:45. The Canucks moved within 1 at 11:42 on a rush up the ice from defenseman Ben Hutton, but captain Shane Doan snuffed out the Canucks' comeback bid at 13:54 with a redirect in front on the power play.
On defense, the Ravens boast superstars. This group is cut from the same fabric as the Steel Curtain and the 1985 Chicago Bears. It all starts up front with Haloti Ngata, a defensive tackle flat out stingy on the running game. This unsung hero carries the Raven defense. Behind him are two All Pro linebackers, one destined for the Hall of Fame. Ray Lewis, though questionable to play with a foot injury, and Terrell Suggs are perhaps the most frightening men in the NFL. I wouldn't even want to play a game of checkers with them. They will steal your lunch money and take your girlfriend to Prom. Together, they are ruthless on disrupting the passer and tackling from sideline to sideline. Oh and how about we throw in one of the greatest free safeties to ever play behind them? Tremendous. Ed Reed roams the secondary as well as Ken Griffey, Jr. in his prime did center field. Ball-hawking abilities through the roof, speed of a gazelle and pound-for-pound the hardest hitter on defense, Ed Reed is a flat-out gamechanger.
Today, Temple is sporting the rather masculine cowgirl style she favours – dark grey jeans and an embroidered grey shirt with a red silk neckerchief and a cow-shaped belt buckle. She is tall, slim and healthy-looking, her face make-up free. Her intensively researched lecture on helping the development of autistic children is delivered with charisma and humour, although her unusual speech pattern is somewhat staccato. But what is most remarkable, given her on-stage confidence, is the diagnosis she was given, aged three, that she was unlikely ever to speak at all.
The cattle industry of the Midwest in the 1970s, however, was not an easy place for a young woman to succeed. She faced extreme sexism and bullying, and on one occasion, her car was covered in bloody bull's testicles. ‘Lots of the cowboys wanted me off the site because they said their wives didn't like me being there,' she says. ‘But because of my autism, I didn't pick up on that social stuff. I didn't notice their dislike of me, I just wanted to work on the squeeze chute. So long as I could do that, I was happy.'
But rights ombudsman William Tarek Saab said the youth was killed by a "homemade explosive".

“I had a boyfriend who didn't realize that women had pubic hair,” [one young woman said]. “Because he had only watched porn, he had never seen a naked woman outside of porn, so he just sort of failed to realize they had pubic hair.”
When my middle-aged friend asked about the impact of porn on my own life, my thoughts jumped to a gentleman friend and recent fling who I'll call Ben. Ben is a gentle and reflective guy; he knows how to touch a lady lightly, and is fun in bed. At one point during the frolics, Ben wanted to enjoy a certain (somewhat stereotypical) position, which sounded fine to me. I had a good time, because he's a good person to have sex with, but it was less exciting for Ben than he thought it would be.
For now, his hands will be more occupied with shedding offensive linemen once again.
Elias Boudinot ( i-LY-əs boo-DIN-ot; May 2, 1740 – October 24, 1821) was a lawyer and statesman from Elizabeth, New Jersey who was a delegate to the Continental Congress (more accurately referred to as the Congress of the Confederation) and served as President of Congress from 1782 to 1783. He was elected as a U.S. Congressman for New Jersey following the American Revolutionary War. He was appointed by President George Washington as Director of the United States Mint, serving from 1795 until 1805.
On September 24, 1789, the House of Representatives voted to recommend the First Amendment of the newly drafted Constitution to the states for ratification. The next day, Congressman Boudinot proposed that the House and Senate jointly request of President Washington to proclaim a day of thanksgiving for "the many signal favors of Almighty God." Boudinot said that he

Because the real turkey some generals are talking is Turkey … as in the strategically located Muslim-majority nation where America stores some of those tantalizing nukes Trump wants to stockpile. It's also where one of the world's many strongmen du jour is cracking down on his enemies in the press … along with many, many others. And it's where the military has traditionally been the guarantor of the secular nation's often tenuous democracy. It's the type of role the military in the United States has (mostly) avoided over the course of American history. At least, that was until Donald Trump became commander-in-chief.
Now, in a mostly overlooked story, Politico has detailed the extent to which Trump's cabinet of generals has quietly formed a phalanx against the possible excesses of a man who has described himself as the “most militaristic person who will ever meet.” According to Politico, the elevation of Sith Lord-wannabe Steve Bannon set off alarms among Trump's generals. That order also marginalized Joint Chiefs Of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford. It left “the nation's highest-ranking military officer, without a permanent seat on the NSC's most senior body” and put Bannon in the all-important role of being the last person to have Trump's ear when Mr. Militaristic makes life and death decisions to use kinetic force.
And that's the real danger the generals now have to guard against — the inherent paranoia that seems to come with the strongman style of governance. Ultimately, when the leader begins to confuse himself with the state — and when culpability for mishaps and malfeasance are opportunities to force underlings to fall on their swords — the generals in tenuous democracies often have to do what the electoral system cannot.
Analysis: If the Lions are committed to running the football, there isn't a better offensive lineman on the market than Iupati. But he's not without flaws. While a dominant road grader in the ground game, he's inconsistent in pass protection, surrendering as much pass-rush pressure as Rob Sims last season.
Williams and Paea would give Detroit two starting-caliber interior lineman under the age of 30 with different skill sets. Williams is a load at 327 pounds and stout against the run. Paea exhibits great burst off the line and has the ability to be a highly disruptive pass rusher.
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was referring to IK Gujral, say sources, when he dropped a bombshell by alleging that " some former Prime Ministers compromised India's deep assets " on national security.Mr Parrikar did not name anyone when he made the comment while explaining why he did not want to reveal details about a Coast Guard operation on December 31, in which a boat from Pakistan blew up after being intercepted off the Gujarat coast. The source of information might have been compromised, he said.Sources said today that the Defence Minister was referring to the dismantling of India's intelligence network in neighbouring countries during Mr Gujral's tenure as PM under what was called the Gujral Doctrine on foreign policy.Inder Kumar Gujral was the Prime Minster for just under a year in 1997-98 at the head of a United Front government supported by the Congress. He died in 2012.A furious Congress, which has been in power for much of the past six decades and has given the country six of its 17 Prime Minsters, asked the Minister to either give names or apologise. Congress leader Manish Tewari said the Defence Minister has made a "very grave charge."At an event in Mumbai, Mr Parrikar said about the Pakistan boat that blew up, "We intercepted it from 200 km away. For 24 hours, the boat was going in circles. Is that not enough proof? What more do you (reporters) want? I was asked to give 'proof' but I refused. I said 'absolutely not' because the source might be compromised. You have to build assets and you have to build deep assets. Deep assets are assets which have to be created over 20-30 years, but this country has seen PMs who have compromised deep assets. I won't take names. Many people know."Opposition parties, including the Congress, had questioned the Coast Guard operation and demanded evidence that the vessel that exploded with four men on it, was carrying suspected terrorists. Mr Parrikar mocked the Congress for making the demand. "Tomorrow, during such an operation, we will take along a cameraman and also the Congress spokesperson," he said.
Your normal 1-2-2 looks something like the picture below. F1 is up ice, pushing the puck to the wall; F2 is on the defensive side of the opposing winger on the wall; F3 is above the opposing center; and the defensemen are making reads from there.

Offshore the Horn of Africa, reported incidents rose from 9 in Q1 2013 to 15 in Q1 2014, but Dryad analysts attribute part of this data to a misinterpretation of events such as the misidentification of regional fishermen in the Southern Red Sea and off the coast of Oman.

Rather, Pyrrha had been ecstatic – after all, she always had fun whenever Ruby planned for a date. Not only because it was great to spend time with her energetic girlfriend outside of campus, but because no matter what zany adventure or place Ruby took Pyrrha to, they always found a way to brighten up her day or even week.
The tall redhead wasn't able to take more than two steps before her girlfriend put a stop to that. "Aww, please?" Complete with the pout. The one that made Pyrrha entirely certain her smaller half could get away with murder.

While the Supreme Court's decision grabbed most headlines this week, the Senate pulled the comprehensive energy bill from the floor for the foreseeable future. It was the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, rather than anything having to do with energy, that knocked the bill off track. Democrats, led by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), pushed for spending to address the crisis while Republicans insisted on a spending offset if the amendment were to be adopted. The bill seemed to gain some traction earlier this week with a proposal from Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman James Inhofe (R-OK) that the Congressional Budget Office says will not add to the deficit. Nonetheless, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) decided to focus floor time on other issues this week. Stabenow believes that the energy bill can pass if a compromise to address the Flint crisis is reached, but as of right now, that looks unlikely.

"If you're a young player in that defensive line room and you've got J.J. Watt and Vince Wilfork in that room, you'd be crazy not to kind of follow those guys around," O'Brien said. "Now you don't have to try and be like them, but I think you'd be nuts if you didn't use those guys as examples. You've got the best defensive player in the league, and then you've got this guy who's going to go down as one of the best interior linemen to ever play the game, and you're a first or second-year player in that room. You're not going to follow that example?
SALT LAKE CITY — Jon Huntsman Sr. recently said in an interview that he doesn't consider tithing as philanthropic giving and that people should be more willing to donate to charities.
Huntsman has given away $1.5 billion — or about 80 percent of his total wealth — to various causes and charities, according to Forbes. However, that total does not include his tithing of 10 percent of his income that he has given to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Tithing money typically goes to fund the costs of building LDS temples, churches and supporting missionaries, according to mormon.org.
Huntsman said he doesn't include his tithing as charitable giving.
Forbes reported that Huntsman is one of 19 living people who have donated more than $1 billion each to charity. Huntsman made the bulk of his wealth through his chemical products company, Huntsman Corporation. He also started and funded the Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute after losing his mother, father, grandmother, stepmother and brother to cancer and battling it himself.
Huntsman said giving to charity is very fulfilling for him.

The FCC promised a fix, and here it is: FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, an Obama appointee and former cable lobbyist, has drawn up rules to allow ISPs to decide which communications you can see in a timely, best-effort fashion and which services will be also-ran laggards. In so doing, Chairman Wheeler sets the stage for a further magnification of the distorting influence of money and incumbency on our wider society. Political candidates whose message is popular, but who lack the budget to bribe every ISP to deliver it in a timely fashion, will be less equipped to reach voters than their better-financed rivals. A recent study looked at 20 years' worth of US policy outcomes and found that they exclusively responded to the needs of the richest 10% of Americans. Now the FCC is proposing to cook the process further, so that the ability of the ignored 90% to talk to one another, network and organise and support organisations that support their interests will be contingent on their ability to out-compete the already advantaged elite interests in the race to bribe carriers for "premium" coverage.
According to Apple's filing, there are five patents included in the new suit: “application programming interfaces for scrolling operations” (7,844,915); “list scrolling and document translation, scaling, and rotation on a touch-screen display” (7,469,381); “programmable tactile touch screen displays and man-machine interfaces for improved vehicle instrumentation and telematics” (7,084,859); “double-sided touch-sensitive panel with shield and drive combined layer” (7,920,129); and “portable computers” (6,956,564).
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai defended the rule change, saying it was “utter nonsense” that rules banning cross ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station were still in place after massive changes in media over the last four decades.
The park had brand-new rides, allegedly and believably imported from Italy (Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to be the park Kim Jong-un visited with his wife).

I also rode the bumper cars and an exhilirating belly down ‘flying' roller coaster, dubbed the superman ride.

Vercingetorix sent out cavalry detachments to harry the building work and the foraging parties while the construction was underway. As the siege tightened, there were cavalry battles in the three-miles-wide corridor between the outer wall of the hill-fort and the inner wall of Caesar's circumvallation. On the night before the Roman fortifications completely encircled Alesia, Vercingetorix sent out all his cavalry. Their mission was to return to their own tribes and conscript all the men of military age. The lives of 80,000 men inside the fort were in their hands. The horsemen escaped through the last gap in the Roman lines and galloped off to raise reinforcements.
Hoboken Housing Authority Chairwoman Dana Wefer gave Hudson County View an update on the HHA earlier this week, explaining what initiatives have taken place since Acting Executive Director Robert DiVincent took over in August.
Ironically, the cartoon in question did not even depict the strongman himself – Anwar rarely goes that far. Instead it mocked Sisi's high-handed habit of telling the country's long-suffering citizens to “share the burden” of Egypt's economic crisis. A young boy needs the toilet and his father asks him: “Why do you want to go the bathroom right now? It's a critical moment for the country and we should all share the burden.” For Anwar, the backlash was a good example of the pressures mainstream Egyptian cartoonists regularly face from not just the authorities but also their nationalistic readers. Despite stopping well short of the implicit red line of ad hominem criticism, Anwar had gone too far. “This is the hardest era,” concludes Anwar, “in which to cartoon in a mainstream newspaper in Egypt.”
Here are some ways not to react to the five-minute major for slashing and the game misconduct earned by Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Radko Gudas on Thursday night:
3. Making sure to note that Gudas is a talented and capable defenseman as a way to defend his reputation. Sure, of course he is. That's why these semi-frequent circus acts that get him suspended, and take that caliber of player out of the lineup for several games, are even more lamentable.
Here are some ways to actually react to the five-minute major for slashing and the game misconduct earned by Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Radko Gudas on Thursday night:
Earlier in the week, the Rubio campaign moved swiftly to squash a report from CNN that there had been some discussion within the campaign of dropping out before Florida. Spokesman Alex Conant declared it “fiction” on air as he condemned the network.
My first foray into this arena involved a winter quarter introductory physics final exam. I had been gifted with a friend's surplus espresso machine that I'd barely used, not being much of a coffee fan at that time. Also, all of us freshmen had received a gift box (sub-category: male) full of useful “male” things. One of these useful things was a packet with two No-Doze in it. I had six apartment mates and none of them had used anything other than condoms from their kits yet (as a physics major, which is tantamount to a degree in abstinence, my condoms had gone decidely unused).
The standouts remained what they were in the theater. Jonathan Hogan is the wise and baffled boss Mr. Walker, who seems to be Van Druten's answer to the sexist Mr. Brewer — a model of the way a man should behave in a world where women have suddenly become an integral part of the workforce. Julia Coffey is splendid as Miss Janus, who spars with Mr. Brewer. A reliable long-time employee, protective of the other workers in the law office on London Wall (an address in London), Miss Janus has been waiting a long time for her unreliable (and unseen) boyfriend to pop the question. “He hasn't had so much reason to be keen these last three years,” she says bitterly. “He'd had all he wanted without marriage.”
One revealing aspect of all this is that the government has charged Edward Snowden with espionage. And as former Texas Congressman Ron Paul noted this week, "espionage means giving secret or classified information to the enemy."
Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne recently claimed that he was told by a senior Republican Congressman that there was a plot to “remove Trump suddenly from office”. Browne said the plan was to “take the president out,” by a method other than impeachment or indictment.
So, my college boyfriend suggested we spend a weekend at Wilbur Hot Springs, a two-and-a-half-hour drive northeast of San Francisco. Wilbur straddles a dirt road in the middle of an 1,800-acre nature preserve. On one side of the road leans Wilbur's turn-of-the-century hotel, cockeyed and rambling, with bunk rooms, a communal kitchen and some private bedrooms; on the opposite side is the "bathhouse," a roof on stilts with fancifully curling eaves that shade a series of long, resistance-pool-shaped tubs. It was there that I learned my first lesson in nude coexistence: your naked body is not the most potentially embarrassing thing about you. If I felt any self-consciousness or anxiety, it was on behalf of my boyfriend's naked body, which exposed more about me than mine did.
Citing security concerns and fears of arms smuggling, Israel has progressively tightened the blockade over the past 15 years. Once a thriving enterprise, Gaza's fishing industry is now on the verge of collapse. Fishermen are cut off from the heavily populated shoals, and have seen total revenue drop by half in less than a decade.
Following the Oslo peace accords, signed in 1994 between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA), Israel permitted the fishermen to go 20 nautical miles (NM) out to sea.
Those fishermen who go further out risk being arrested, shot, and killed, or having their boats destroyed or confiscated. However, human rights organizations have reported that fishermen have been attacked even within the 3-NM zone.
Click here to read about fisherman Mohammed Hassuna, who says he and his crew were recently surrounded by Israeli Navy boats, shot at, forced to strip, and swim in frigid water to the Navy gunboat, where they were handcuffed, blindfolded, and their feet chained.
"It has become too expensive for many fishermen to take the bigger boats out to sea, so only some smaller boats venture out," says Sacco.
The cost of one fishing trip can vary between $125 and $625, depending on the size of the vessel, nets, and crew; many fishermen cannot cover these costs.
Dallas has already done much of the work that was expected to come on the restricted free agency front, taking out much of the possible drama of the month of June. For Texas, big time RFAs Justin Dowling and Brendan Ranford both got deals early in the month. Here's a rundown of the remaining RFAs in Texas.Lagace turned heads this season, no question. With his effort this year, he's going to get a qualifying offer and be a big part of the plans next season in the AHL. The deal is likely to be a one year, "prove it wasn't a fluke" deal.Stransky is in an interesting spot. He had the best season of his career this year in Texas, but it's not clear that he has a spot in the organization above the AHL level (or perhaps in any organization). If Matej Stransky were 'Matthew Stransky' from Saskatoon, he'd continue playing in the AHL on an AHL deal if he didn't get a QO, but he is not. The winger is from the Czech Republic and will always have the option to go home and make a decent amount of money for less punishing hockey in his home country. Personally, I think you give him an offer. Whether he signs it is another question.The Jack Campbell era sadly comes to a close in Cedar Park. Campbell is a great goaltender when he is on. Since the Calder Cup season, he hasn't been on frequently enough to make him part of the long-term plans in Dallas. I do hope he finds success in the league, but I think he needs a reset. There are any number of organizations that would love to have a goalie with his experience and would give him a flyer to see what might come.Peters isn't likely to get a qualifying offer. After a year with Willie Desjardins trusting him for big faceoffs on the fourth line as a rookie, Peters got buried in Idaho by the new regime. He spent much of this year on the injury list and his social media lends credence to the belief he has moved on from playing the game.The hulking defenseman out of the Q never played a game with the Texas Stars and spent last season in Europe. He hasn't made much noise to make it seem like he would get a deal. Dallas has more prospects incoming that would require deals. Vance isn't worth the QO.
First-round pick Michael Rasmussen will be in attendance along with the rest of the 2017 draftees - defensemen Gustav Lindstrom, Kasper Kotkansalo, Malte Setkov, Cole Fraser and Reilly Webb; forwards Lan Zablocki, Zach Gallant, Jack Adams and Brady Gilmour; and goaltender Keith Petruzzelli.
Also on hand will be defenseman Dennis Cholowski, the Red Wings first-round pick in 2016; forward Giavani Smith, defenseman Fikip Hronek and goalie Filip Larsson from the draft class of 2016; forward Dylan Sadowy, who was acquired last year in a trade with San Jose; and defenseman Vili Saarijarvi and goalie Joren von Pottelberghe from the draft class of 2015.
Two of the Red Wings recent free agent signings, defenseman Libor Sulak and goalie Matej Machovsky, will also be in attendance. Sulak played for the Czech Republic in this year's World Championship and Machovsky played for the same country in the 2016 World Championship.
The 45 players - 21 forwards, 18 defensemen and six goalies - will be divided in two teams named after Red Wings veterans Henrik Zetterberg and Niklas Kronwall.
Red Wings sign Czech defenseman Libor Sulak The 6-foot-3, 207-pound free agent played professionally in Austria the past two seasons.

In these soft days, I gather blind batsmen don't run: scores are based on how far the ball has been hit. At the special blind school where I and my friends regularly played, two totally blind batsmen would cheerfully hare off from opposite ends for quick singles, frequently colliding in the middle with earth-moving consequences (one of them my now slightly crooked nose).
The value of mimicry in blind cricket must not be underestimated. Mischievous fieldsmen would often imitate your batting partner in calling you for an impossible run. Compared with the gamesmanship employed by blind players, the likes of "bodyline" Jardine, Tony Greig and Paul Collingwood are mere babes in arms.
Asami just smiles sweetly. “I already have one, thanks. My girlfriend here got it for me.” Korra nearly jumps when Asami loops an arm around her shoulder and pulls her close.
Once they're out of sight, Asami laughs a little and turns to Korra. “Sorry about that. Bolin or Mako are usually my fake boyfriends whenever some weirdo tries to hit on me. So, thanks.”
The sky is steeped in rich orange light by the time they reach the docks. The air smells of saltwater and drying seaweed, and fisherman have begun to bring their boats in for the night, looping rope fast around the iron dock cleats.
Not only has the Nork madman threatened Japan by launching intercontinental ballistic missiles into the vicinity of Japan's boundaries but has often sent them over Japan which is a major jab into the Japanese sovereignty and puts the nation at risk.
Freshman running back Mike Boone rushed for 85 yards and scored three touchdowns Saturday. Boone and senior Rod Moore (75 yards rushing) have excelled since replacing Hosey Williams and Tion Green, who were lost to season-ending injuries.

President Obama, Treasury Secretary Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have steadfastly maintained that the world does not need a new reserve currency.
It turned out that “Against the Grain” is about a nobleman who shuts himself away in a house, weary of people, weary of society, weary of the age, a man who finds everyday life insufferably banal and who, alone in contemplation, endeavors to establish a completely artificial life, through books, paintings, art and music, but also through grand, performance-like happenings in which he recreates the world outside by stimulating individual senses — smell, sight, taste, hearing — in systems as closed as they are unsettling. Moreover, he is obsessed by decay, obsessed by all that unravels, crumbles away, weakens, dies.

Even the usually partisan HASC Chairman Buck McKeon, after offering a very short defense of the House and GOP's actions on sequestration, spoke the truth to the Joint Chiefs and the packed hearing room: “It's not your fault. It is us.”
It's a bit of a shame that AMC's The Walking Dead is TV's highest-rated horror series because it's among the least compelling. Now shambling through season four, it remains one of TV's most inexplicably popular shows—or maybe explicably popular, alas. Despite legit-scary moments, it's as dramatically sophisticated as a weak soap, easy to half-watch and easier to hate-watch. Will Rick and the gang defend the prison against the zombie hordes? Will Rick find time to get it on with the badass swordswoman Michonne? Will Daryl and Carol become a memorable TV couple even though their names rhyme and she calls him “Pookie”? And, after four seasons, will the show reveal some semblance of a point? At least makeup master Greg Nicotero keeps topping himself; he's a master sculptor working in Karo syrup and latex. Luckily, though, The Walking Dead is surrounded by horror shows that take risks, of a sort, and that play sprightly games with genre expectations. MTV's Teen Wolf might be the best series based on a really stupid movie since Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Its mix of teen angst, superheroic mayhem, and poker-faced philosophizing is very Joss Whedon, even more so than the solidly entertaining and seemingly indestructible Supernatural (now in its ninth season) and The Vampire Diaries (in its fifth).
The freshmen series Bates Motel and Hannibal sliced through the first half of 2013 like dervishes. Both were present-day “prequels” built around too-familiar serial-killer narratives, and both did new and frequently astonishing things with the one-hour weekly form. Vera Farmiga's sensitive work as Norma Bates and Mads Mikkelsen's unexpectedly dapper and empathetic work as Hannibal's flesh-eating shrink demonstrated that horror was perfectly suited to modern TV's post-Sopranos urge creating sympathy for devils. By delving deep into the tortuous relationship between Norma and her son, Norman, and expanding its scope and scrutinizing the hothouse corners of their furtive little Northwest town, the show evoked Twin Peaks in the best way. Hannibal was even more fascinating: a waking nightmare that might be the most purely visual (and visually arresting) series to air on American network TV since Miami Vice almost 30 years ago. Its bizarrely fussed-over tableaux reached back into horror history, beyond TV, beyond cinema even, to reconnect with Grand Guignol theater and the history of Western painting, with special emphasis on Francis Bacon and Salvador Dalí. On both shows, a big part of the excitement comes from wondering, Is any of this working? An impressive percentage of the time, the answer is yes.
Fox's Sleepy Hollow and NBC's Dracula (debuting October 25) liven up old horror stories with lush visuals and conspiracy-laden story lines about secret societies. In Sleepy Hollow, reawakened nineteenth-century soldier Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) teams up with small-town cop Abbie Mills (Nicole Beharie) to battle the Headless Horseman, a harbinger of coming apocalypse. The series has some of the same coiled comic energy as Tim Burton's same-named 1999 film; it's a comedy-­horror concoction, with action scenes that split the difference between brutality and elegance, and Scully-and-Mulder–style banter between Ichabod and Abbie. The hero's fish-out-of-water rants are priceless. “What's insane is a 10 percent levy on baked goods,” he grouses. “You do realize the Revolutionary War began on less than 2 percent? How is the public not flocking to the streets in outrage?” When the show threatens to become too arch, the horseman comes stalking in, blades flashing. He's a great screen monster; he and the Terminator would have a lot to not talk about.
Evangelicals see Donald Trump differently. They are ready for an unapologetic strongman to help them do end-times battle.
Many evangelicals see him differently. They are ready for an unapologetic strongman to help them do end-times battle. They believe that God will soon separate the “sheep from the goats,” the righteous nations from the unrighteous. During the final judgment, God will decide which nations were faithful to him and which were not, and he will dole out punishments and rewards accordingly.
Wednesday, ESPN's Pierre LeBrun stated that he knows the Flyers have Predators' defenseman Ryan Suter at the top of their shopping list. Ryan Suter is very, very good. This often gets overlooked not only because he's in Nashville, but also because Shea Weber is even better than Suter and hitting free agency this summer as well.
This would normally be cause for concern, but this group of shaky and/or unproven defensemen are just as good as the third pairing options the Flyers had last year, when nobody was worried about the need to acquire one of the best defensemen in the NHL.
Unfortunately (fortunately?) that doesn't stop the speculation about the Flyers acquiring Shea Weber, Ryan Suter, Cam Fowler, Luca Sbisa, Luke Schenn, or any other enticing defenseman. But what do defensemen cost on the trading market?
Here is a table of some of the best defensemen acquired in the last twelve months and what it cost to acquire them:
Young defensemen don't often get traded. In the past calendar year, only one sub-25 defensemen was traded off an NHL roster.
This is an admittedly small sample, but it's not a stretch to say the reason there are so few young defensemen traded is that these guys just aren't on the trading block. When they are, the cost of acquiring them is high.
Defensemen in their prime get traded more frequently, possibly due to them reaching unrestricted free agency sooner.
Older defensemen who still have the ability to play in the top four aren't traded too often, whether it be due to shorter contracts, signing with teams who are buyers at the deadline, having un-moveable cap hits, or something else entirely.
Young defensemen do not get traded often at all, but when they do, their price is high.
Prime-aged defensemen get traded fairly often, but they require top-6 forwards, second round picks, and/or Dale Tallon.
Older defensemen can cost very little, two first round picks and a second round pick, or anything in between.
Olt, who turns 24 later this month, is hitting .287 with 27 homers and 81 RBIs for Double-A Frisco. He has a .973 OPS and is considered one of the top defensive third basemen in the game. Olt has played a few games in right field and at first base, although he's primarily been at third.

It is important to review the past to see how we are today, without going back very far in time we discover that for the young French player things have not changed that much. Roccat, the team in which Steeelback was the starting marksman during the 2016 Summer Split, had difficulties maintaining their spot in the EU LCS, adversities that in the end they managed to overcome, not without effort and pain, “Yes, for me it was really hard because we had very bad results and it affected me in a way.”
Today he lives with his long-term girlfriend in a home he shares with her other boyfriend. Occasionally his partner's teenage daughter also stays over. He is also in four other long-distance relationships, people he sees with varying degrees of frequency.
Franklin and his girlfriends are what's called polyamorous or “poly” as the community tends to call it. Being poly simply means you can be in more than one relationship, with the full support and trust of however many partners they choose to have.
"Male-bashing" is a term I grew up hearing often, and not just by women, but also brothers, fathers and uncles around me. No one took it seriously, but everyone of the second sex did it... the hormonal teenaged girls who were just entering the world of boys, 20-somethings who had boyfriends and ex-boyfriends, the middle-aged married women who were struggling to find the balance between husbands, kids, parents, in-laws, and work, as well as the elderly women who spent their evenings in the park, giggling over the daily spats they had with their husbands. It was all in jest, taken as a frivolous activity that women indulged in. Until, of course, a couple would break into a fight, and the husband, in a fit of anger would spew out the blasphemous words, "God knows what kind of ideas your female friends are feeding you!" It was in statements like this, that the innate misandry in this innocent act of “male-bashing” would be exposed.
Having two young and talented offensive linemen in that group will make that task easier and there's no question that beefy running backs D'Onta Foreman and Chris Warren have the bruising capabilities to make that type of physical domination into a reality.
Finally, if Obama solicited my advice, I'd inquire if all other avenues of resolving this crisis have really been exhausted. Have we exhausted all attempts to achieve a diplomatic solution with Assad? Have we exhausted all attempts to dialogue with him and/or with his allies? I know the media is now painting this leader out to be a Hitler-like madman who can't be reasoned with (and his mustache doesn't help this image), but it wasn't long ago when this western educated leader was a considered a reasonable, and even humble, ally of the US. What happened? Are we to believe that this former dentist just lost his mind and soul? Does he have a legitimate grievance with the US that we might be able to rectify? Is there anything we can do to open the door to dialogue and move toward a non-violent resolution of this conflict.
Yad Vashem Chairman Avner Shalev said even though that feature could be misused to post anti-Semitic comments, the risk is outweighed by the benefit provided to future generations seeking information about their ancestors.
Second baseman Johnny Giavotella hasn't yet become the player he seemed likely to become based on the maturity of his plate approach in the minors even while often skewing young for his levels. He's projected to produce something between a replacement-level and league-average season, given the opportunity. Among pitchers, Yordano Ventura and Kyle Zimmer were recently ranked as the top-two prospects in the organization by Baseball America. They also appear to be the rookie-eligible pitchers most likely to succeed in the majors this season.
Young also spoke to one of the parliamentary draftsmen who crafted this legislation: this unnamed law officer recalled that he had been told to ‘tread carefully', as full and open admission of what was being done to parliamentary sovereignty would have been ‘so astounding' as to have put the whole Bill in danger.
RANDOLPH COUNTY, Ill. -- Drew Peterson is accused of trying to hire a hitman to kill Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow, who was the lead prosecutor in Peterson's 2012 murder trial.
It's a not uncommon sight on sword-related forums these days. An aspiring student of the Japanese sword arts, left-handed, joins the forum and asks about studying ken (be it kendo, iaido, or aiki-ken) with a left-handed grip. He is quickly informed that no, Japanese swordsmanship is a right-handed affair, that all Japanese swordsman were right-handed, saya were worn on the right and saya-ate avoided at all costs, and trying to learn it left-handed would be weird at best, uncouth and disrespectful at worst. Veteran lefties give him “Ganbare! I've been there, too!” encouragement. Righties tell him about all the things he'll find easier because he's lefty. Sometimes the lefty responds with resignation, and sometimes he rages against the system. The left-handed grip is natural for them! This adherence to right-handed grip only is outmoded, discriminatory, and stupid! This, predictably, turns just about everyone against him, lefty and righty alike.
The larger issue, though, is that everyone is wrong in the first place. Japanese swordsmanship is not a strictly right-handed affair. Yagyū Shinkage-ryū Heihō includes both strikes with the left-hand only and hidari-tachi — a left-handed grip. Nitō technique includes the standard dai-right, shō-left configuration as well as the reverse: daitō in the left and shōtō in the right. To the best of my knowledge, all of the above is present in Hyōhō Niten-ichi-ryū except for hidari-tachi and it wouldn't surprise me to find that in there as well. Even in modern kendo, there is no rule prohibiting a left-handed grip and stance, and one can see both hidari-jōdan with its standard grip and left-hand only attacks (actually more common than the “orthodox” migi-jōdan) and even gyaku-jodan, with a left-handed grip. Both orthodox and gyaku nitō can be seen as well.
Another reason is the ultimate pragmatism of the sword arts. A swordsman should be able to be effective in any situation, with any weapon, in either hand. If you should suffer injury to your right hand or arm, you don't want to be without options. I'm speaking here largely from a Yagyū Shinkage-ryū perspective, but from what I've read of the Gorin-no-sho, I suspect it also applies in Hyōhō Niten-ichi-ryū as well. As one should not rely on one particular technique, or one particular weapon, so one should not rely on one particular hand.
• She says yes, and becomes your girlfriend
Furthermore, you can introduce her to some of the new girls you've met over the course of the 3 months you've moved on and create a jealousy plot line. This is going to show her that you are liked by other girls and gets her thinking about you on a non-sexual level. Bring your new girlfriends (even if they are just friends) around when you see her again. Watch what happens when she knows you've been spending time with other women.

Edelman's statement ends by calling for "narrow legislative fixes" that would make it clear: unlocking your cell phone isn't a crime. In addition to legislation, the White House also calls for the FCC to play a role.

Besides, criminals have gun rights too says the gun lobby. When three major Florida law enforcement groups sought to tighten laws after the Sun Sentinel reported concealed weapon licenses issued to 1,400 probable felons (including a man who shot his girlfriend as she cooked breakfast, a pizza deliveryman wanted for fatally shooting a 15-year-old over a stolen order of chicken wings and six registered sex offenders), NRA lobbyist Marion P.

Millard, 32, and Smich, 30, are already serving life sentences with no parole for 25 years. Millard was a cocky aviation heir playboy with planes, a helicopter, countless vehicles — and a penchant for crime. He was idolized by Smich, his former drug dealer-turned-brother from the other side of the tracks — with the criminal ties he needed.
Before his arrest in the Bosma murder, Smich had told his girlfriend “it wasn't the first time” that they'd burned a body and “it wasn't the only body that they burned.”
When the bubbly University of Toronto English and drama graduate suddenly went missing in July 2012, Babcock's former boyfriend Shawn Lerner went to Toronto Police, but complained they seemed uninterested after learning about her mental health issues, recent escort work and drug use.
While they were a duo for years, Millard wanted his trial severed from that of Smich, whom he referred to in jailhouse letters to former girlfriend Christina Noudga as “treacherous Mark; got himself charged by trying to put it on me.”
We witnessed the unseemly sight of the accused killer cross-examining the father of his alleged victim — something the Crown had unsuccessfully tried to prevent. Code ruled that while it would be “uncomfortable” for Clayton Babcock, there was no legal reason why Millard should be compelled to hire a lawyer for that cross-examination or that of former boyfriend Shawn Lerner or Smich's former girlfriend Marlena Meneses.
Christina Noudga, now 25, was a central figure in this love triangle, the woman Millard killed for, according to the Crown. Much was made by the defence that his former girlfriend of two years was never called.
Engage in meaningful conversation. I don't mean the ordinary, mundane, where you wanna eat, complete-each-other's-sentences conversation that goes on every shift. Partners need to know that we respect and value their opinions; that we are listening to what they have to say.

As of July 22, the Roberts-Stabenow GMO labeling bill, S.764, has not yet been signed into law by President Obama but the White House said after Congress passed the bill that he would sign it. More than 80,000 people have petitioned the White House urging Obama to veto the bill. Florida Republican Congressman Vern Buchanan also urged the president to veto the bill. In a letter to Obama, Buchanan called the legislation a "sham bill that pretends to offer disclosure but in truth has so many loopholes that it is meaningless."
Take Erica*, an 18-year-old with bipolar disorder. She met her boyfriend, who is also bipolar, in treatment. And even though both have the condition, communication can still be difficult. “Sometimes people ask me to elaborate on how I felt when I was depressed while I am in the more upward swing of my moods. What they don't realize is I really can't tell them,” she tells Yahoo Health. “For my boyfriend and I, being bipolar is a lot like having split personality disorder — you don't remember how your other personality felt. We both agree our calm personalities only get into fights with each other when we are unstable. It's great because our ability to relate has prevented either of us from hiding our mood swings, which can be a huge key to our recovery when we go off the rails.”
But people with mental health conditions shouldn't feel like they have to seek out others who struggle, too. As Erica puts it: “Even though my boyfriend and I are both bipolar and we met because of that, that's not the main thing we connect on.”
Spokesman Paul Miner said: "The extent to which the threat is growing - nearly doubling in a year - is deeply worrying.
If you suspect your partner is cheating and you decide to snoop through his or her things, you're never quite sure what you're going to find. Evidence of an affair? Evidence of something bad that's NOT an affair? Evidence of nothing? How about evidence of something so horrific you immediately dial 911? That's apparently what happened to the boyfriend of 32-year-old Tanai Fortman. Thinking she was cheating on him, her boyfriend snooped through her cellphone and iPad, only to get the shock of his life when he reportedly found sexually explicit videos of his girlfriend -- and a child!
House Appropriations Chairman David Obey (D-Wis.) unveiled a bill Tuesday to fund the government through the rest of the year that is in the spirit of Washington's new austerity, saying the measure “prohibits funding for Congressional earmarks.”
His name was Styophan Andrashayev, and he was a soldier, a strelet in service to Nikandr Khalakovo and his brother, the Duke. Styophan was sent west in command of a small fleet of windships to treat with a band of vicious tribesmen known as the Haelish. The Haelish had long been enemies of the Empire, and so the Grand Duchy had good reason to speak with them.
It took a review to crystalize it for me. Justin Landon at Staffer's Book Review called Styophan an everyman character, and he is. He's removed to a degree from the weight that sits on the shoulders of the aristocracy. He's not embroiled in magic and the ephemeral nature of using it. He loves his country dearly, but his mind is weighed more by thoughts of his wife and growing a family than it is the welfare of the entire Grand Duchy.

He was only penalized for holding nine times throughout his career. He made the Pro Bowl nine times, and was named a first-team All-Pro six times, with one second-team selection on top of that. Seattle has already retired his No. 71 jersey, and you'd be hard-pressed to find another offensive linemen with his accolades. You'd be hard-pressed to find another player in general who was better than Jones.

Foreman's son, Jason, had been missing since 1975. It was only after Woodmansee tried to kidnap another young boy that authorities found Jason Foreman's bones. In his trial, Woodmansee received a 40 year sentence, but is eligible for release 12 years early because of a plea bargain. Foreman agreed to the plea bargain because he didn't want to hear the details of his sons death – a decision he regrets. “I put it all behind me… and now, you know, 12 years off for good behavior, come on. It was a shame he only got 40 years to begin with, he should have got a life sentence,” Foreman said to WPRO-AM's John DePetro on his Monday morning radio show.

But the rest of the draft has been disappointing. Austin Seferian-Jenkins has been hampered by injuries throughout, as has Charles Sims, so that's worse luck than anything else. But Kadeem Edwards and Kevin Pamphile haven't been able to get on the field much, despite playing behind some of the worst offensive linemen I've seen in Tampa, ever. And that's saying something!
The first that is known about him is that he became a freeman of the Leathersellers Company in January 1623, having served an eight- or nine-year apprenticeship. He was elected a warden of the yeomanry of the leather-sellers in 1630, and a liveryman in 1634. In 1630 he married his wife Sarah, with whom he would have at least one son, Nicholas Barbon.

Here is a true story: A Vietnam War veteran went to a self-defense class to support his girlfriend. She was told to be vigilant, always. She was told to be aware of her surroundings, always. She was told to hold her keys between her fingers like a weapon, to be prepared at all times for an attack, to treat every stranger like a potential enemy, a potential threat. Her boyfriend — a soldier, a vet — said it reminded him of his war training. War training is how I walk home from the subway after dark.

Kisuk Cha says he and his girlfriend went to the restaurant in Queens and ordered wings and buffalo shrimp to go.
However, Cha says when he was handed the receipt, he saw something on there that completely shocked him. Cha says in the space that is normally reserved for the customer's name, the cashier had typed “Chinx.” Cha and his girlfriend are Korean-Americans.
Tottenham are edging closer to signing £15million-rated Brazilian hitman Leandro Damiao.
"I think they're different in terms of the type of player they are, both of them are smart and dependable and tough, do a lot of different things to try and help set the table for the rest of our lineman and get everybody going in the right direction."
World-weary hangman John Ellis, who turned a gun on himself, was also spared. "If your aim had been as true as the drops you have given it would have been a bad job for you," the chairman at Rochdale Police Court told him as he was discharged. "Your life has been given back to you, and turn it to good use in atonement."
“They [the Muslims] were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people's computer networks unauthorized,” Bartiromo began. “At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees…. they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers.
The Nationals potentially have something good brewing here. Ryan Zimmerman is back. Werth will hit better. Ramos will improve. Danny Espinosa is a terrific second baseman with some pop in his bat (13 home runs). Yes, it's a distraction. But they'll be fine. Riggleman wasn't the reason for the recent surge; the players were. Players win and lose games. All you want is a manager to not screw things up. Maybe Riggleman didn't screw up the Nationals, but unless he has some very close friends who run major league franchises, his career is certainly screwed.
I turned back around and saw a rotund gentleman sitting at the wheel of a Yellow Taxicab. He was wearing a cool black leather vest over a white tee shirt, a couple of nice silver rings and looking right my way, smiling big and featuring two gold teeth front and center.
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has said repeatedly that coming close won't determine the nomination, that the nominee must break the 1,237 barriers. That's a message some of the leaders in the stop-Trump movement are trying to reinforce, no matter what has happened on the past two primary nights.
That iteration of Palmer — the guy who looked every bit as good as Peyton Manning or Tom Brady in 2005 — was set to compete with Ben Roethlisberger for a decade's worth of AFC North division titles. Instead, their rivalry as equals ended after Palmer's first postseason pass. Hosting the Steelers in Cincinnati in the wild-card round, the Bengals forced the Steelers to punt. On their second play from scrimmage, Palmer dropped back and hit Chris Henry on a go-route for 66 yards. As the crowd celebrated, the camera panned back to reveal that Palmer was in agony behind the play. His knee had been ripped apart by a diving hit from Steelers lineman Kimo von Oelhoffen, a blow that would be made illegal three years later after Tom Brady was taken out by a similarly diving Bernard Pollard. For the next four years, Palmer's playoff record consisted entirely of one pass for 66 yards.
Finally, the USC product refused to renegotiate his contract heading into this 2013 season, leading to another epic game of chicken between Palmer and his employers. It eventually led to the Raiders trading Palmer away (in order to start Matt Flynn, somehow) to the Cardinals for a conditional seventh-round pick. In agreeing to the deal, Palmer gave in, renegotiating his contract into a $16 million, two-year deal that the Cardinals will get out of after this season. Because the Raiders waited until the beginning of April to trade Palmer, Arizona was the last starting job left standing. It left Palmer playing behind one of the worst offensive lines in the league, and that was only the beginning. The Cardinals would draft guard Jonathan Cooper in the first round later that month, but Cooper suffered an injury in August that will keep him out for the whole year. Left tackle Levi Brown, the most notable offensive lineman on the roster, wasn't remotely competent after coming back from a season-ending injury, and made it through only the middle of October before being dealt to the Steelers. If you saw what Seattle did to Palmer on Thursday, you know what's going to be happening to Palmer over the remainder of the season. He's basically going to get hit and hit until he gets hurt, and when he does, the Cardinals will be down to Drew Stanton at QB. Palmer is biding time before his next missed opportunity.

Justified Season 4 Teasers: Your Greatest Enemy May Be Standing Right In Front Of You By Jesse Carp Random Article Blend It wasn't that long ago that we last saw Timothy Olyphant on FX thanks to a great cameo on the network's fantasy football comedy The League but it doesn't really compare to getting to see the actor grace the small screen in his ten gallon as U.S. Deputy Marshall Raylan Givens. The Season 3 finale of Justified was months ago and it feels like forever since we last saw Elmore Leonard's lawman touting his shotgun in an attempt to clean up his childhood home of Harlan Country.
I waited through the whole five-minute speech for Zano to circle back and explain how living with these women enriched his life, or how he followed their example to achieve success or something, but the actual point of the story was that these women wouldn't have been such miserable man-haters if they'd only had equal, livable pay.
Santos says he and fellow detective Peter Corr went back to he houses together after police received a call just after 10 a.m. reporting that “the gentleman in question was again standing in his front door naked.”
The buyout period ends today at 5 pm and the Jets have sent out a release that longtime Jets defenceman (one year with Thrashers) is heading to waivers for purposes of being bought out.
The other issue is that shooting a moving vehicle is a very ineffective way of actually stopping it. Most of the time, officers will miss — since cops simply aren't always the marksmen we see on television and in the movies. They might even hit the wrong target, like a passenger or a passerby near the car.
“The US-India partnership should be, could be, one of the most defining of the 21st century. But, I am disappointed that the US failed to develop a strong friendship and comprehensive partnership with Narendra Modi when it mattered most," Congressman Eni Faleomavaega said.
What's tougher to find, for those of us on the outside, is the common thread tying a running back, safety, linebacker, receiver and two offensive linemen together. And so that's part of what Payton, Ireland and GM Mickey Loomis went back in the files to study before this year's draft.
These lacunae perforating the earth below Nottingham's modern housing have served as tanneries, cess pits, dungeons, summer homes, malt kilns , sand quarries, wine cellars, meat-curing rooms, decorative follies , pigeon coops and allegedly a bowling alley, although I'm having a hard time finding corroboration for that one. Edward III's army is said to have used a tunnel called "Mortimer's Hole" in 1330 to slip into town and capture the rebellious nobleman Roger de Mortimer . The Sheriff of Nottingham reputedly ensconced Robin Hood in a dank pit that was later used as a prison chapel. During World War II, the British fled into the cave system to avoid air raids, and at one point it also housed glowing stocks of radium.
To start with, here's an example. When you met your first boyfriend or first girlfriend, you probably had a lot of different perceptions: eye color, facial structure, attractiveness, body structure, clothing, the smell of their perfume or cologne, the sound of their voice, the location, how you felt emotionally, where you met and so on.
So long-term memories are stored as groups of neurons. Any related visual, sensory, or emotional components of the memory are stored in neurons in the appropriate part of the brain. To retrieve a memory, the neurons can be fired as a group in the same pattern that was used during the original event, e.g. meeting your first boyfriend or girlfriend. The stronger the links or pathways, the faster you can retrieve the memory.

“We have been exploring the esports market for a number of years and have been waiting for the right opportunity to enter,” said Robert Kraft, Chairman and CEO of the Kraft Group. “The incredible global success of Overwatch since its launch, coupled with the League's meticulous focus on a structure and strategy that clearly represents the future of esports made this the obvious entry point for the Kraft Group.”

Let's just contact him and find a suitable replacement and all that. The next bit of correspondence, this gentleman asking me about a sponsor dinner, meaning he had booked a bar & grill saying that I was going to be there and it was going to be a post-show party; like saying, all of us who had gone to a Wrestle-Pro event then afterwards we would all meet up at this spot. He told me that the event kind of hinges me to be there, and I was very forthcoming, like, hey, it's unlikely that I am going to be at the show in the first place but we are doing everything we can to get there, but I don't know if I can be able to make it to the post-show dinner. That was the last bit of correspondence that I had with him; the rest of the correspondence had dealt with him and my Manager, which sounds kind of snooty, but that was how it was. It got to the point where I had to take a flight from Vancouver in the morning to Hartford, and I was going to be there 30 minutes before the show actually started. It wasn't the end of the world, we were going at the end of the night, so it's not the end of the world, it was happening later in the night so we could make it happen. Had there been a single travel woe, I wouldn't have made it. I am still on the set of Arrow at 4 in the morning the night before, laying on the rooftop in a cold pool of rain water with the character Diggle pointing a fake gun at me, doing the same scene over and over again, and I'm not saying anything or really needed, but I'm there. As the time is going by, I'm thinking to myself that it is 4 in the morning, there is just no way I can make it. I should be at the airport already because it takes 2 hours in customs. I'm in Canada, so the Arrow people are super accommodating; they put me in a van, changed my clothes, just brilliant. I mean, I'm a glorified extra on the show, asking for my own ride, but they took care of me great.
Another day another update. Finally coming out of the stone age… maybe we will be less a caveman simulation now *cough*. It's our first step to advancing an age in TUG with crafting and a few additional bits, along with an adorable, and also very annoying little surprise.
The actresses play four best girlfriends in the last two weeks of their senior year of high school. It's a grounded comedy about dealing with the first real losses in life — leaving your best friends and contemplating death and the passage of time, that odd mixture of grief and nostalgia experienced by young people as they try to understand these losses. It is also about getting stoned with your friends in your car while listening to hip-hop.
Benilde-St. Margaret's offensive lineman Eric Wilson announced Sunday morning he has given an verbal commitment to Harvard over a scholarship offer from the Gophers.
Gophers offer would be ‘incredible,' for top state offensive lineman
The Gophers have two early commitments in the 2017 class: Marshall offensive lineman Blaise Andries and Robbinsdale Cooper O-lineman Eric Abojei.
As much as we want to believe adding another receiver or offensive lineman to Seattle's roster will help, I'm not sure you'll ever have it easy against these teams.
Despite my preference to mock a receiver to Seattle in recent weeks, I firmly believe continuing to stockpile defensive lineman would also be a good idea.
At the combine we should be looking at tall defensive lineman with length and long arms. Speed helps, but probably isn't vital if we're talking interior guys.
It's not a great class for defensive lineman by any means, but there are some interesting options for Seattle. I'm particularly high on Virginia's Urban and I like the upside of Hageman.
Many representatives were receptive to Shuren's arguments. But the examples in the FDA's report weren't enough to convince Congressman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Congressman Michael Burgess (R-TX), who is also a physician. Both went after the FDA's report for what they said was a small number of case studies. "It took you three years to provide us with 20 [examples]!" Burgess told Shuren. Congressman Joe Barton (R-TX), perhaps unfamiliar with capitalism's incentive system, raised similar objections. "Why in the world would a lab develop a test that wasn't safe and accurate?" he said. "My office isn't being overrun by calls from doctors and patients saying that there are some terrible LDTs out in the marketplace."

Third-year lineman La'el Collins, who is coming off a season-ending toe injury, is expected to make the move from guard to right tackle, replacing Free. Many view this shift to actually be an upgrade. But so far, Collins continues to struggle with consistency as he tries to make the transition to a position he hasn't played since his time at LSU.
He doesn't expect any additional draft-eligible underclassmen to apply for the NFL by the Jan. 15 deadline, after cornerback Logan Ryan and running back Jawan Jamison did so last week.
Superman will, uh, return
Despite Superman's demise at the end of BvS and his subsequent funeral, Snyder has promised that Henry Cavill's Clark Kent will play a large role in Justice League. Fans are pretty convinced, given the multiple appearances of an all-black Superman suit on set, that this storyline will follow the Death of Superman comic closely.

Now we went to the camp to try to get... to catch two Japanese who were reported to be living there... we saw one Japanese still sitting there, with a woman on the corner and weeping... and that man was sitting there with his head low there... once we caught a Japanese raping, and he was naked. He was sleeping... I know another case where because of the boatman... he told me this: where he saw that too on his boat, it happened on his boat... after raping, the Japanese asked the old man in that family, isnt that good?... I forgot to say that when the Japanese asked the older man whether it is good or not, he wanted the old man to rape that young girl so all the girls -now I saw this - they all jumped into the river. So the whole family jumped into the river and all drowned. This is not second-hand story. This is real, real and genuine, and we have, we know that, the boatman has been with us for a long time (pp. 2,569-2,573).

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called O'Malley's comments "absurd."
Duke tight end Davis Koppenhaver got an earlier start on his college football career than he may have expected three years ago when injuries to upperclassmen Braxton Deaver, Dan Beilinson and Erich Schneider forced him in to the rotation as a freshman. Last season, with Deaver and Schneider back healthy, Koppenhaver took the unusual route of redshirting his second year. Many thought it was due to a lack of available playing time, but Koppenhaver shared the true reason on his Instagram account over the weekend.

The FCC regulates “obscenity, indecency and profanity” on radio and television and often issues fines for on-air swearing. However, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski issued a statement of support for Ortiz on the agency's official Twitter account after the game.
Whichever chinese proverb said 'patience is a virtue', the man had clearly never had a 14 year old girlfriend whom they had only seen once in almost two months. In reality that man was likely a monk, thus celibate. Which meant no wives, or children, or anything like that. So really what did they know?
The truth was that Elsa wasn't the only one suffering from withdrawal symptoms. Granted, Anna's were less severe but they were still there. She didn't argue with pillows, for her it was usually letting her mind drift to this world where she was with her girlfriend all the time and no one could separate them for any reason. At some point she would come back down to reality, back to disappointment, and when people would ask if she was okay she would just avoid or dismiss the question. As she had just done.
But that still didn't change the fact that her need to see her girlfriend was bordering on codependency.

McDonagh sat out a fifth time in seven games Sunday, but the Rangers improved to 7-1-1 in the past nine with a 1-0 overtime victory against the Detroit Red Wings. The Rangers are 4-0-1 without McDonagh in the lineup.

In the morning he is on edge, almost uneasy. Kumar Sangakkara edges a catch to second slip, soon after so does Steve Davies. Twenty minutes in, two batsmen gone, and Surrey four down now. Leicestershire haven't won a championship match in the last two years. Easy pickings, some say. But under their new coach, Andrew MacDonald, and captain Mark Cosgrove, they have a hard edge.

“Wealthy families who helped him over the years were responsible for the organization of his funeral,” Basti explained. “Hitler was buried in an underground bunker, which is now an elegant hotel in the city of Asuncion.

It was only a couple weeks after starting to date his boyfriend that Stevenson High School's gay star wrestler, Dylan Geick, decided the closet wasn't for him.

In the latest Wikileak, Judd Legum of ThinkProgress is revealed to have written in a 2014 email to green activist billionaire and Hillary Clinton bagman Tom Steyer:
The FCC will likely vote along party lines later today to approve Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to scrap the Obama-era rules that require internet service providers to treat all web traffic equally. Net neutrality supporters say that the move to repeal the 2015 rules will upend the level playing field that businesses enjoy on the internet and disrupt the free flow of information online.
“Together with his Republican colleagues, Chairman Pai will shrink consumer protection, competition and innovation ten sizes too small, delivering the goodies instead — like price hikes, extra tolls and users' personal information to sell — to giant broadband providers like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon,” said Gigi Sohn, who served as an adviser to Pai's Democratic predecessor.
Colts Alumni in the NHL Update by: Paul Clemente St. Louis has gone 5-5 in the passed 10 and the Blues are shuffling their defensive corps. The moved Alex to the left side for the first time in his career to further help the team string together some wins. Pietrangelo leads the Blues with takeaways and shots per game in this two week stretch.The Panthers are falling fast. 5-4-1 in their last 10. Ekblad is coming under fire with only having 3 points in his last 14 games with no goals. He came into the season with a career +30 and is now -16 in his young stint in the NHL. Ekblad is on pace for 26 points this season which would be a massive step down from his 39 points in his rookie campaign.Brodie is in a three-way tie for the third worst plus/minus in the league at minus-16. I know +/- is not the best stat to measure a player's performance but when you're the lowest in the NHL ... woof. The Flames are holding on to a whisper of an NHL playoff season with the benefit of a weak division and Brodie is the scape-goat. The Flames are the most short-handed team in the NHL which doesn't help any defenseman with their game. However, he is one player I'd love for the Penguins to trade for when they inevitably have to move Flower.The major news with Girardi is that he's being shopped. His 5.5m cap hit for 3 more years in considered a "must move" contract. His ice time is down recently to around 19m a game and most consider him gone by trade deadline. Girardi is a stay-at-home player who blocks shots and hits. He leads the Rangers in hits these passed two weeks but other defensive stats have declined to 4-5th level on the team.Since coming back from injury, it's been tough for Prout to crack the line-up of the Cinderella-story Blue Jackets. He has been a healthy scratch for the passed 3 games. He did play against the Hurricanes on 1/10 earning 2 hits and a blocked shot.Scheifele is on a hot streak scoring 4 goals in the passed two weeks. He is also shooting at a 33% pace which is crazy. Currently 11th in the entire NHL in scoring, there aren't too many players on his level right now. He leads the Jets in most scoring shooting stats and is leading the team in points.Pearson is back on track with 3 goals in the last two weeks. He's had 5 points in his last 5 games. With the injury to Toffoli the Kings really needed his offense and he's delivered. He also has a point in the last 7 of 9 including 2 game winners.With the Islander's shake up firing long-time coach Capuano, Strome is looking to revive his young career with the Islanders. With only 1 assist in 2017 he's been demoted to the 4th line, in a move that he claims helped him simplify his game. With Weight behind the bench he can only hope he can earn a better spot on the team.Clifford netted a goal and 15 PIM by fighting Luke Witkowski from the Lightning. Clifford is doing his job by being 4th in the league in fighting majors and 78 hits this season.Andreas was one of the most productive players on the ice recently going on a 7 point tear. He's now at 14 points in 27 games and riding a 3 game goal-scoring streak in which he's earned 7 points. He is also running a 2.12 points per 60 which puts him in Crosby/McDavid range of potential. Take that how you want.Burmistrov was claimed by the Coyotes after being placed on waivers by the Jets. He has struggled to get a work visa for over a week and has earned an assist Monday in his Coyotes debut against the Oilers. It's all up to Alex and how hard he wants to work. He can be in the KHL by this spring of revive his career in the desert.Labanc has cooled off a little for the Sharks predictably. He's still on the Shark's second line with Logan Couture and the recently rejuvenated Mikkel Boedker. He's also earning time on the Shark's 22nd ranked Power Play. Labanc has surprised alot of people in his unexpected NHL debut season.Sgarbossa was recalled by the Panthers on 12/29. Putting in 13 points in 14 games for the AHL Falcons he's earned his call up. Earning bottom pair minutes he will need to do whatever he can to stay on the Panther's squad. When Barkov, Bjugstad, and Huberdeau get healthy he might get shipped back the Springfield.Hutchinson has lost his last 4 decisions on a poorly performing Jet's team. The Jets are a team that is slipping downward to the NHL basement and being a back up on a team like that will not do you any favours.
There are limitations to the data. They cover only full-time freshmen who get federal grants, loans, or work-study jobs. The most recent figures cover the period ending more than a year before that January White House summit. And some schools dispute how net price should be determined and use their own calculations that are different from the federal formula.
On tour, he would do a four-hour sound check, a three-hour show and then head to a hired studio. “He would consider 1am, after playing a stadium show, the point at which his day could begin,” Rogers says. “One of Jimi Hendrix's former girlfriends said Jimi would put on his guitar to walk from the bed to the bathroom. Prince was the same way. Making music was his way of being in the world.”
One rock, popularly referred to as "Zoo Rock", depicts elephants, barasingha (swamp deer), bison and deer. Paintings on another rock show a peacock, a snake, a deer and the sun. On another rock, two elephants with tusks are painted. Hunting scenes with hunters carrying bows, arrows, swords and shields also find their place in the community of these pre-historic paintings. In one of the caves, a bison is shown in pursuit of a hunter while his two companions appear to stand helplessly nearby; in another, some horsemen are seen, along with archers. In one painting, a large wild boar is seen.[citation needed]
According to Bruce Levine, the Cubs and Ryne Sandberg are finalizing a deal for the Hall of Fame second baseman to become an ambassador for the team.
Chicago Cubs and Hall of fame second baseman Ryne Sandberg finalizing agreement on becoming a Cub ambassador . — Bruce Levine (@MLBBruceLevine) January 14, 2016
Sandberg will appear at the Cubs Convention, which begins on Friday. The longtime Cubs second baseman and 1984 MVP, threw out the first pitch before game 3 of the NLDS at Wrigley Field between the Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. Now, he'll have a bigger role with the team, although specifics aren't known at this point.
As a working musician, William Elliott Whitmore has become a jack-of-all-trades. In addition to six full-length records and a handful of singles, Whitmore has provided music for various movies, documentaries and television shows. In 2010, Whitmore recorded his own version of the old cowboy tune “Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie” for the emotional climax of the western themed Red Dead Redemption video game, which sold 15 million copies.
After seeing early gameplay footage, Whitmore's role as the grizzled general makes perfect sense. The character sports a cowboy hat, full beard and aviator sunglasses, a look that you could easily and comically imagine Whitmore dressed up as if he were in a Hollywood movie.
My first boyfriend had his pilot's license. I did not get in a plane with a 17-year-old with a new license, in case you are wondering. My dad, who served in the Air Force for over 20 years, had his private license and instrument rating, although he hasn't flown in many years. I've worked for several companies that had planes to help manage travel. I've flown in small two-seaters and in Gulf Stream jets.
West's importance to contemporary black thought is what makes his recent Guardian broadside against Coates so disheartening. Not only is it a case of one of black thought's elder statesmen attempting a hatchet job on a younger writer, West thoroughly botches the job via disingenuous readings from which a reader is tempted to conclude one of two things: Either he hasn't read We Were Eight Years in Power very closely, or he has intentionally misrepresented Coates' writing in an attempt to bolster his own brand. (It is probably not a coincidence that West's Twitter feed is full of plugs for the 25th-anniversary edition of Race Matters.) Coates addressed West's attack but deleted it along with his entire Twitter account. The New Yorker's Jelani Cobb also assailed West on Twitter, accusing him of “cloak[ing] petty rivalry as disinterested analysis.” It's hard to say for sure, of course, whether West was motivated more by competitiveness or by ideology. But it's pretty shocking that he authored a partially baked, inaccurate hot take that all but labels Coates a stooge of white liberalism—an accusation that feels especially reckless coming from a writer of West's stature.
Such moments of insincerity are what make West's piece so disturbing. They suggest that West came to extinguish another, younger writer's light rather than meaningfully engage him as an interlocutor. This attempt isn't befitting of an elder statesman who, even as he critiques and challenges, should in theory want to nourish other writers who share his desire to write America closer to true democracy. For those of us who, like Coates, find solace in being part of a community and lineage of black writers, West's critique breaks the promise of that community.
"Rep. Metcalfe's goals of media attention and political gamesmanship are accomplished through loud, arrogant and misguided claims. Instead, his priorities should be reforming education, job creation, fixing our transportation system, or making the streets safer for kids and families, and should also include cleaning up the good ol' boys' system of public corruption. Instead, he chooses to focus on wasting time and battling me because I had the gall to run for office, win and serve Pennsylvania as an independent watchdog over the government they desperately want to rule.
Directed by Tony Award-winner John Tiffany and the creative team behind Once comes the Broadway revival of The Glass Menagerie. The story follows a Southern Belle named Amanda Wingfield who lives in St. Louis with her two grown children. Amanda wishes a better life for her crippled daughter Laura and begs her son Tom to find a suitor for her. However, the gentleman caller named Jim causes more trouble than the family can keep up with.
As an opening batsman who has also kept in his past two games for Western Australia, Bancroft could conceivably play as an opener, a No.6 or a keeper-batsman at No.7.
But having taken the gloves in just three first-class games in his career, Healy said Bancroft "doesn't deserve to be the Australian wicketkeeper" and should play as a specialist batsman instead.
‘The men I work with would be appalled if I accused them of misogyny or sexism – they love their wives and girlfriends dearly'
The macho chat disturbs me. Any woman who walks in front of the van is assessed as to whether she would “get it” or not. The men I work with would be appalled if I accused them of misogyny or sexism – they love their wives and girlfriends dearly – but they refuse to acknowledge that their “harmless banter” normalises the sexual objectification of women.
Mullin also repeatedly rebutted claims that taxpayers pay his salary, calling it “bullcrap,” and that he pays enough in taxes to make up for it. His spokeswoman, Amy Lawrence, told a local news outlet: “The congressman is referencing the federal taxes that he and his businesses have paid to the government over the years, prior to his being in office. Like all business owners, Congressman Mullin pays his taxes, which contribute to congressional salaries.”
I've been with my boyfriend for six years, and we're talking about it. I always say, "Well, you don't have to." It's a little bit like when you as a gay couple want to have kids then it becomes really serious. And kids? No. (Laughs.) But my boyfriend wants them. So that's a little bit of a problem right now. We'll see.
Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann felt so outraged by the energy-saving proposition that she introduced the Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act to abolish the recommendation. Defeated Republican contender Mitt Romney also picked up on the subject.

According to an arrest affidavit obtained by WTSP, Kaitlyn and her girlfriend began dating in November 2012. The victim reportedly told police they began a sexual relationship and according to the report, the victim was 14 and Kaitlyn was 18.
So one point I remember I thought of in class but did not get a chance to share was that if one simply were to consider the factor of time and long term costs, then the tragedy of the commons and prisoners dilemma are straight forward. If you abuse everyone then you are giving permission to everyone else to abuse and so you guarantee that there will be drastic consequences for all, including yourself. So there is something wrong, or uneducated in the human in seeing the short term benefits, and see that through time the events that will come to pass. This is important then in educating children to plan ahead, and see how small acts have big consequences. Another interesting point that is related is how people see that there is a loss of benefit for everyone though do not emphasize (at least my teacher) the costs to everyone. If fisherman abuse the oceans, THEY will pay the cost ALONG with everyone else. If you abuse the group, YOU will pay the cost, it is certain and only takes time. So there are plenty reasons, obvious, commonsense, here, to not abuse at all.

Besides keeping a close eye on West Indies cricket, Richards has stayed involved with the game in a mentorship capacity for the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL, Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash and most recently with the Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League for the last two years. One of the most destructive players of all time, Richards keeps his advice simple to eager young batsmen who have sought him out during these stints.
It's notable, then, when a pull hitter changes his game, and even more notable when he does so and still has success. Which brings us to this season's patron saint of adaptable pull hitters: Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas.
Exhibits A, B, and C: the Twins' alignments on the left side of the infield immediately before and after Moustakas's bunt against them above. Mouse over the GIF to see still images of third baseman Trevor Plouffe's positioning in the moments after the bunt; in the moments after Moustakas's batted ball in his next at-bat, which went for a single; and in the first inning the following day.
“It's as perfect a test of two people's functional strength as you can get,” says Odd Haugen, the president of Mas Wrestling USA. A veteran strongman athlete (he was crowned the Strongest Man in America in the 1999 AFSA USA Strongman Championship) and lifelong promoter of strongman competitions, Haugen fell in love with the sport when he realized it provides the one element that's missing from most events: man on man combat.
“I was always looking for a better way to pit man against man,” he says, though women, of course, compete with gusto. “Highland games and rope pulling have always had their place, but Mas involves more dynamism than any individual strongman event.”
To prepare for his victory, Licis performed mostly strongman activities. (“The tension during the Atlas stone is very similar to pulling someone over the board in Mas wrestling,” he notes.) But in the weeks leading up to the match, he ran drills to sharpen his technique. When Haugen, his unofficial coach, prescribes Licis drills, he includes lots of quick, dynamic movements that use the same musculature as squats and deadlifts. That means a lot of box jumps and speed ladders in addition to monkey bar work and muscle ups to improve speed, coordination, and strength in the arms and posterior chain.
“But the average lifter should know that training in Mas wrestling gets you better at strongman as well,” says Haugen. “It greatly benefits the deadlift and Atlas stones, and I've found that it can actually improve problems with your back. That's because Mas wrestling is like the opposite of the squat and deadlift: instead of pulling perpendicular to the spinal column, you're pulling along the spinal column, so most of the stress goes into the hamstrings and the butt while the spinal column gets stretched, rather than jacked.”
It still looks like he's got a long road to the Olympics, and his next step is to bring Mas to CrossFit centers and strongman competitions around the the country. If strength, simplicity, and an undeniable nostalgic bent are what appeals to the market, Mas wrestling might just be on its way to a comeback.
A student who's hoping to pay for her engineering degree with gifts of cash from wealthy sugar daddies says her boyfriend doesn't mind her befriending older men.
Surprisingly, Mei's relationships, which she says are platonic, don't impact her real life love affair, with restaurant worker boyfriend Mason Chilton, 19.
Teen romance...but Winnie Mei has other men in her life. The student, pictured with boyfriend Mason Chilton, enjoys lucrative friendships with older men
Despite his initial shock, her boyfriend of three years, restaurant worker Mason Chilton, 19, claims he has no problem with the way she makes money.
Now, Mason says he has even considered meeting her dates: 'I didn't like the idea of my girlfriend going out with other guys, but that stemmed from jealousy.'
"That's when I saw officers behind the suburban with their weapons drawn," he said. "They were hiding behind the trees right across the street where there's a park, and so I saw that their attention was on a gentleman that was right outside the Wells Fargo bank."
According to a Facebook post likely penned by frontman Maynard James Keenan, the “sonic and visual extravaganza” will take place during the month of January, and see the four-piece ensemble “dwarfed by dramatic video projections.” Additionally, the opening acts “will in all likeliness be exciting to many Tool enthusiasts.”
Rockland County Legislature Chairman Alden H. Wolfe praised the progress the county has made.
Marner has used his size to his advantage this season, quickly avoiding defensemen to create space and allow his linemates to find better positioning as well.

New category for Yahtzee so you can't really compare it to last year's awards, but yeah, Halo 5: Turdians was named the blandest of the bland for 2015. It shares the title with games like Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and others I can't remember and can't be bothered to watch the video again to see because, well, bland.Interestingly enough, my two favorite games this year, Elite: Dangerous and Undertale, made number 2 and 1 respectively on the "Best of" spot.And I hear you, raging fanboys angered by this topic's very existence ruining your 343i-teet-sucking-session, Yahtzee is a PC gamer above all and Halo is just the sort of big franchise title that's so very easy to bash from a PC gamer's perspective-- but as someone who's not a PC gamer and has played every single Halo and has mostly enjoyed every single Halo (up until now), I have to agree. The game does very little to add something new and refreshing to the franchise, just rehashed gimmicks from other FPS titles. Not to mention the content that made Halo, well, Halo, and not Space Call of Duty Advanced Armored Sociopathic Space Marine Warfare, is oddly missing from the game. More than half the gametypes that worked very well with Halo's sandbox have gone missing without so much as a "Have you seen this gamemode?" label on the side of a milk carton. Plus you can throw any idea of this Halo being another Halo with couch co-op or LAN parties into the crapper, because it has neither. Oh what's that? Your internet down or Lizard nerds being Lizard nerds again? I'll just play Forge until--- ohhh wait nevermind it's online-only.My friend started sounding like a parent worried about their depressed teenage child, because he keeps telling me "It gets better." I'm having a hard time believing that though. Every time I look at 343i's recent business practices I don't get a sense of "We hear you," but instead "I can't hear you over the millions you already gave to us, suckers". We get free monthly updates which basically means "This game was not finished at launch so we're adding stuff over time and calling it free," but even those updates feel hollow. People have made list after list and "demand" after "demand" on things the whole community would like to see come to this game in the future and we've gotten very few of it. Instead we get a fix or two here and there for things like the atrocious aiming or file sharing, but the bulk of these updates seems like things they've planned for a while and don't actually fix any of the problems with the game. Several of the 'new' maps were shown pre-release either as concept art or promotional material (I'm looking at you Battle of Noctus), and I'm sure more "remix" maps are to come which have nothing to do with the lack of gametypes or social aspects that the game sorely...well...lacks. More randomly-"earned" cosmetics and weapons instead of actual requirements and ways to get them (I'm looking at you Achilles Armor; a step in the right direction but we need a lot more done like this and not just for the new stuff going forward).Voice your blind defenses with the age-old "That's just your opinion" line or agree with a smash of that like button. And discuss if you agree with Yahtzee or not and why, and please try to use common sense with your responses.
The 27 year old frontman will cost a reported ?2.5m with the La Liga club negotiating to receive the cash up front.
So far Democratic leaders have not tried to quiet Kucinich's stance on Libya, even as it opens Obama up to criticism from within his own ranks. In fact, House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Larson (Conn.), who like Kucinich said that Congress should have been called back from recess last week to consider a declaration of war, credited his colleague for his outspoken position on the issue.
That's what my mum told me last year when I arrived in Australia for Christmas with my boyfriend for the first time. My mum's statement felt like a slap in the face: After spending so many years struggling with myself, I was finally happy and totally in love.
The 9,000 square meter warehouses is where boxy Soviet cars used to roll off the production line. Now, it hosts the work of Dmitry Marinichev, President Putin's internet ombudsman who heads his own IT solutions company RadiusGroup.
My father, a World War II Marine infantry officer, taught me to shoot. He had trained Marines on the firing range as an expert marksman and cared deeply about gun safety. He raised me, the oldest of his children, to know and understand the power of weapons, to use them extremely carefully and to respect the grave danger they represented.
In 2008, the American command on the ground calls for manpower to carry out an effective strategy against the Taliban. Bush agrees to send additional soldiers and by mid-2008 there are 48,500 US troops there.
BEIRUT – A retired high-ranking Syrian intelligence official has been killed outside Latakia in a grisly murder blamed on militiamen loyal to the government, the latest instance of wanton criminality to rock the regime's coastal bastion.
The vehicle's presence did not raise suspicions though, because the victim's neighbors were used to the retired intelligence official hosting militiamen in his villa “day and night,” including at loud parties that lasted until the early hours, Zaman al-Wasl reported.

But UT-Austin has always had a testy relationship with the law. Since 1997, the university has had to accept more and more students. By 2008, 81 percent of incoming freshmen at UT-Austin were top 10 percenters. University leaders warned at the time that they soon wouldn't be able to accept anyone outside the top 10 percent, making it hard to field a football team or attract any out-of-state students. Suburban legislators were also upset because the law made it nearly impossible for quality students from their competitive schools to get into UT-Austin if they weren't in the top 10 percent.
The fourth congressman facing an ECI notice is former Chief Minister Shankersinh Vaghela who enjoys the status of union Cabinet minister at present. Vaghela has been served a notice for “making objectionable and inflammatory speech which can incite and induce communal hatred.”
Because of the frequency of these incidents, B'Tselem was not able to get an exact tally of how many had actually occurred in the West Bank during those years. The Judea and Samaria police reported 2,100 to 3,000 incidents annually during those years, while the IDF Spokesman reported 3,600 to 4,300 incidents each year.
The IDF Spokesman added that although it had asked B'Tselem to deal with the issue of judging minors in a fair and complete fashion, and had given B'Tselem information about 160 cases in which minors who were used by terror groups to carry out serious terror attacks, “the group chose not to deal with the issue of judging minors in a balanced manner and did not deal with the use of minors by terror groups in a fashion that violates human rights and contravenes international law.”

The men behind the Sizzlers attack were white Christian South Africans. The Orlando shooter was a Muslim of Afghan descent. The results were the same: the almost unimaginably gruesome deaths of gay people who had gathered in a venue to “dance and sing and live”, as President Barack Obama put it, but also to feel safe. That's why most of us go to gay clubs. To kiss your girlfriend and not feel the predatory stare of a straight man on you; to hold a boy when you dance without fear of being beaten up in the toilets.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, this week pushed the FBI to turn over all documents relating to Peter Strzok, the official who was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's team due to political bias.
The 11-on-11 period in which the offense played so fast Thursday was more even Friday. A couple of true freshmen stood out during that period, with Shane Lemieux knocking a defensive lineman off his feet to spring a catch-and-run by Carrington, and Ugo Amadi getting into the backfield to bring down a running back. … Oliver was consistently around the ball during a period focused on running plays. He also forced Adams to tuck it away and run by blanketing a receiver when the offense tried to employ a play action fake. … Seisay also had an interception in the end zone during position drills.
Other observations: A whole bunch of true freshmen went head to head on the lines during team drills. The offense fielded a line of, left to right, Brady Aiello, Calvin Throckmorton, Jake Hanson, Zach Okun and Lemieux, while the defensive line was Drayton Carlberg, Gary Baker and Gus Cumberlander. … Speaking of offensive line groups, the quintet of Tyler Johnstone, Matt Pierson, Matt Hegarty, Cameron Hunt and Tyrell Crosby has played together quite a bit the last couple days. …
Christina Applegate's Boyfriend Lee Grivas Found Dead
A teenage Alaska fisherman cast adrift when a wave sank his boat floated for 26 hours in a plastic fish bin before his rescue by the US Coast Guard.
But on the whole, for fishermen in eastern Canada, it meant they could fish unhindered out to the limit without fear of competing with the foreign fleets. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Canada's domestic offshore fleet grew as fishermen and fish processing companies rushed to take advantage. It was also during this time when it was noticed that the foreign fleets now pushed out to 200 nautical miles offshore and excluded from the rich Canadian waters, were increasing their harvest on the small areas of the Grand Banks that were outside the area of the EEZ.
Mr. Podesta certainly seems to have made the effort to build a business relationship. About eight months after Mr. Podesta joined Joule in 2011, an investment fund backed by the Russian government, Rusnano, announced plans to invest about $35 million in the company. Several months later, Joule announced that Rusnano Chairman Anatoly Chubais was joining its board of directors. Around the same time, Mr. Podesta joined Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Foreign Affairs Policy Board.
• UM privately believes freshmen defensive ends Jon Garvin and Deonte Johnson have first-round draft pick potential.
Said defensive line coach Craig Kuligowski: “We have four defensive ends that I feel are playing like starters, we have three defensive tackles I feel are playing like starters, another defensive tackle who is a supreme backup. We have three freshmen (DJ Johnson, Jon Garvin, [tackle] Jon Ford) that have potential to be superstars someday, certainly are not at this time.
“But they all are very, very good prospects and have done a good job when they've been able to get in a game. The top two is so tough to crack for these guys - last year if we were in the same situation these guys would have been playing, all the freshmen would have been playing a lot, probably starting a couple of games.
For the second-straight season, the Ducks have made a strong impression on the national stage, and enter the NCAA postseason as a top-eight national seed. Though they were tripped up by Kent State last season, the Ducks hope to punch their ticket to the College World Series with a good showing the next couple of weeks. UO has one of the nation's elite pitching staffs, entering the weekend with a 2.79 ERA. Sophomore left-handed pitcher Tommy Thorpe, who can get his fastball up to 90-91, but relies mostly on a heavy diet of off-speed stuff, leads the way with a 2.22 ERA in 97 1/3 innings of work, while freshman left-handed pitcher Cole Irvin had 15 starts and a 2.61 ERA in 107 innings. Also keep an eye on right-handed starting pitcher Jake Reed, who has a 3.24 ERA in 91 2/3 innings of work, while relievers Garrett Cleavinger and Jimmie Sherfy are elite. Cleavinger is a stocky freshman lefty who can get up to 91, while Sherfy has been up to 98 at times this season. The biggest challenge for the Ducks is getting going offensively. First baseman Ryon Healy has been dealing with a sore back, but is good to go this weekend. He's hitting .324 with 10 homers and 50 RBIs, while Brett Thomas leads the charge average wise with a .328 mark, two homers and 28 RBIs.
Laurence Willey, Eaton's trial attorney, said Lepper had been eating at the restaurant with his family when Eaton became irate that his girlfriend had left him there. Willey said Lepper followed Eaton into the parking lot and confronted him after becoming aggravated by Eaton's demeanor. Willey said others at the restaurant were not troubled by Eaton's behavior, however, and some thought Eaton was being mugged when they witnessed the altercation between Eaton and the off-duty deputy.
According to court documents, on Nov. 5, 2006 Eaton had consumed part of a large alcoholic drink called a “volcano bowl” at China Hill when he and his girlfriend began arguing and using profane language. She left the table, claiming she was going to the bathroom, but instead she called a cab and left without Eaton's knowledge.
Eaton had been a fisherman but was working as a plumber's assistant at the time his shoulder was broken, Willey said.
A fiery young woman with a moving picture recorder machine wants to make a documentary about nomadic tribesmen in the uncharted territories, and she needs a party of strong lads (or ladies) willing to protect her and carry her equipment. She's very driven, and quite willing to sacrifice anyone (but not necessarily her equipment) to get the perfect shot-- which could be a real problem, because the nomads she's most interested in are cannibals and head-hunters...

George Soros is the favorite boogieman behind anything anti-American or anti-freedom. But the reality is, not even a billionaire can single handedly bring down our country. Truth is it takes many of these left leaning, elitist, billionaires to pull it off.
In 2006, the year Thompson was most active in free agency, he signed all of his free agents in the later stages of the process. The two big signings were defensive lineman Ryan Pickett and defensive back Charles Woodson.

The Miami linebacking group is an eclectic mix of a few upper classmen, lots of underclassmen and heavy on unknowns moving forward into the 2015-2016 season. After the departure of stalwart tackling machine Denzel Perryman to the NFL Draft, Miami is now looking to the young cadre to see who will step up to fill the void. In the segment below we'll break down each player in the unit and discuss when he came to Miami (as a recruit) what he's done so far for the team on the field and I'll take a guess as to what I think the crystal ball will read for each player next season.
Juwon Young and Darrion Owens were the two freshmen last season who both got playing time last year but both didn't really make much of an impact in game. Young came to Miami as a solid three-star recruits out of Albany, Georgia. He had offers from many of the mid-tier IA teams in the country and chose Miami over the likes of North Carolina and Ole Miss. Last year he dressed for all 13 games but only had two tackles on the season.
Gay is the elder statesman among a Steelers' cornerback group as eclectic as any other on the team. Gay and Cortez Allen are the mid-round picks, but Allen got the extension Gay did not. Antwon Blake wasn't drafted and Senquez Golson was taken in the second round of this draft.
Freedman reports: "It's quite possible that this March heat wave will be considered an unprecedented event in the US historical record, which extends back to the late 19th century, based on the margin by which records are being exceeded, the wide geographic scope of the heat wave, the duration of the event and the time of year when it is occurring."
McCrum was lambasted for daring to suggest that Victorian Englanders would be so immoral as to resort to such chicanery, CB Fry famously protesting: "The lines marking a penalty area are a disgrace to the playing fields of a public school. It is a standing insult to sportsmen to have to play under a rule which assumes that players intend to trip, hack and push their opponents and to behave like cads of the most unscrupulous kidney."
EXCLUSIVE UPDATED: NBC‘s plan to revamp single-camera sophomore comedy Up All Night as a multi-camera sitcom has suffered a major blow. I've learned that series star Christina Applegate is leaving the Lorne Michaels-produced project, which is still being re-conceptualized and is yet to film any of the five episodes in front of a live audience that had been planned. “It's been a great experience working on Up All Night, but the show has taken a different creative direction and I decided it was best for me to move on to other endeavors,” Applegate said. “Working with Lorne Michaels has been a dream come true and I am grateful he brought me into his TV family. I will miss the cast, producers and crew, and wish them the best always.” NBC would not comment. Some sources say the network is still looking to proceed with the series and may be eyeing Friends alumna Lisa Kudrow as a potential replacement for Applegate, while others say the show is now dead. Meanwhile, Applegate is getting ready to reprise her role in the Anchorman sequel, which begins filming this month.
Item: Speaking of Dugway Proving Grounds, would you sleep any better knowing that Dugway possessed in their labs the very same strain of anthrax that was purportedly used by Fort Detrick researcher Dr. Bruce Ivins, whom the FBI alleges mailed live anthrax to a number of Congressmen and media in September of 2001, resulting in five deaths? Would you sleep better knowing that the FBI refused to investigate personnel at Dugway, instead pinning this crime on the unfortunate Dr. Ivins, who conveniently committed suicide, giving the FBI a “Case Closed” verdict on the mailings? In fact, Ivins did not have the equipment to weaponize anthrax.
"Are they OK? Have you talked to them?" Hunt's girlfriend asked. Rapp said she hadn't.
This morning, Fox & Friends featured yet another segment defending Arizona's controversial new immigration law, this time hosting a gentleman named Allan Wall to criticize Mexican president Felipe Calderón's recent criticism of the legislation. Co-host Steve Doocy introduced Wall as "a U.S. citizen who lived in Mexico for 17 years while working as an English teacher" who has "served in the Texas Army National Guard." As he closed out the interview, however, Doocy revealed that Wall is a columnist for VDARE.com.
The LP cover is very simple, featuring a police officer: The Night Creeper himself. As I discussed with frontman Kevin Starrs earlier, the story is about a corrupt cop who begins to kill people, exploiting his authoritative position which causes newspaper sales to go through the roof. The tale is timely, with plenty of recent news stories about police brutality.

Following Assemblyman John Wisniewski's announcement that he supports U.S. Representative Donald Norcross (D-NJ) despite his common cause with challenger Alex Law in supporting independent Bernie Sanders for president, Law says he is disappointed in the progressive Democrat's decision. Law is running an upstart grassroots campaign in New Jersey's first congressional district, in the heart of George Norcross III's sphere of political influence.
“It is unfortunate that Assemblyman and Bernie Sanders NJ Chair John Wisniewski decided to endorse Mr. Norcross. Assemblyman Wisniewski is someone with a sterling record of supporting progressive ideals, so it struck me as unusual that he would endorse a Congressman with the most conservative voting record in the entire New Jersey Democratic Delegation over a progressive challenger that is leading the Bernie Sanders effort in South Jersey. Assemblyman Wisniewski does have his legislative agenda in Trenton to consider, and upsetting the Norcross Machine undoubtedly would have led to a slow down in his ability to pass legislation. But, as a progressive leader and the chair of Bernie's efforts in this state, I expected him to show his appreciation for his values. And, as President Kennedy said, ‘We must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them.'

Rather than dual employment being the problem, it could be that some young women in Texas who reported intimate partner violence and then took a survey like the 'bad boys' and bad boys tend to be idiots in lots of ways. The statistics bear that out, since older women were less likely to report being victimized than younger women. Instead of letting the data speak for itself, the authors speculate that women who are "home bound" lack self esteem and stay meek, whereas working women violate ingrained caveman sensitivities and get clobbered. They even refer to women who do not work outside the home as “domestic workers”, which sounds a lot like ‘maid', and they say such women lack ‘social capital' - a patronizing dismissal of stay-at-home moms that would be offensive if men wrote it.
Early last week, Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman discussed on air and in print, among other items, a developing situation out of Florida involving 25-year-old right-shot defenceman Alex Petrovic.
Despite running a four forwards and four defencemen protection set for the Vegas Golden Knights expansion draft just so they could protect Petrovic, it appears as though he could be on the outs already with the Panthers. As Friedman reports, Petrovic's ice-time and role have decreased considerably under new head coach Bob Boughner.
One situation to keep an eye on: Florida and Alex Petrovic. Injuries limited him to 49 games last season, but when he dressed he played 18:09 per night. Under new coach Bob Boughner, Petrovic's usage is down. He's had three healthy scratches. The third one came Monday against Tampa Bay after Petrovic was benched for the third period of last Saturday's overtime loss to Detroit. He's also gone from 1:18 per night on the penalty kill to under 30 seconds. These things can change, but defencemen are hard to find and other teams will be watching. Petrovic has one more year until unrestricted free agency.
Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't qualify as Canucks news. Petrovic is a high-end third pair defenceman who doesn't add a tonne offensively but more than holds his own in the right circumstances. He's an efficient puck-mover, and up to this season a reliable penalty killer, too.
That's all we can do though — speculate. Petrovic is a plug-and-play right-shot defenceman — the exact kind the Canucks almost acquired for Gudbranson a handful of months ago. If the Panthers still want Gudbranson, well, it's not hard to draw a connection between the two. Time will tell if this was a signal or noise.
Stanford's freshman class was judged the best in the nation by Top Drawer Soccer and played like it. Three freshmen started – Xiao at forward, Jordan DiBiasi in the midfield, and Alana Cook in central defense. At one point in the first half, six freshmen (counting redshirt freshman Kyra Carusa) were in the match at the same time for Stanford.
Lana Winters, No Not Barbara Walters! prepares for an interview with Lisa Ling; a look back on her illustrious career making politicians and actors decide what kind of tree they would be, cry. It seems Lana Winters, Respectable Journalist! has had quite a life, complete with fancy house and fancy opera-singing girlfriend (wife? whichever), and is about to receive one of those fancy rainbow ribbons from the Kennedy Center. Lisa Ling wants to begin their interview with Bloody Face, which Lana Winters, That Old Thing Again? refuses. Nope! No need to give him any more attention than we already have. So, instead, they begin with Lana Winters, Social Agitator!'s long overdue exposé of Briarcliff.
Iraqi politics compounds the lack of opportunity. The ruling parties in Baghdad divvy up the oil revenues before they trickle south. Their local representatives immobilise the rest. Basra's governor, council head and mayor all belong to rival religious Shia parties. Each vetoes the others' decisions and projects. Their militiamen jostle for control on the streets. In October 2014 Badr, the most powerful militia group, took over Saddam's palace, from where the British ran their occupation in 2003, and pinned portraits of Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and Shia Iraq's own religious leader, Ali al-Sistani, on its walls. Posters of their martyrs line Basra's highways. The limited political freedoms gained since Saddam's fall are receding.
Two fights later it was another crushing KO, this time after a superman punch from Travis Browne.
VISAKHAPATNAM: Shikhar Dhawan struck a sublime hundred in the nick of time as India delivered yet again in a series decider to beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the third ODI and record their eighth successive win in a bilateral contest.India raced to the 216-run target in 32.1 overs with Dhawan (100 n.o. off 85) completing his 12th ODI ton in what turned out to be the penultimate over of the match.Shreyas Iyer made a significant 65 off 63 balls, his second successive half century, but missed on the opportunity of scoring a hundred in a winning cause. Dinesh Karthik remained unbeaten on 26 alongside Dhawan and hit the winning runs.The quick run chase came after a Sri Lankan collapse that saw them getting all out for 215 from a promising 160 for two.The visitors failed to apply themselves on a pitch that offered decent turn as Indian spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav picked up three wickets apiece.With the professional performance on Sunday, India won their sixth ODI series of the year and eighth in a row since July 2016.Sri Lanka, on the other hand, were consigned to yet another defeat in a rather miserable year in which they have won only five matches.The hundred was there for the taking and Dhawan grabbed the opportunity with both hands.During the course of his match-winning knock, Dhawan crossed the 4,000-run barrier in his 96th ODI. He hit 13 boundaries and two sixes overall as he toyed with the Sri Lankan attack.Iyer reached his second ODI fifty in 44 balls before throwing his wicket away by attempting a big shot off Thisara Perara only to sky a catch to Suranga Lakmal at mid-on.The Mumbai batsman survived two dropped chances, when on 25 and 38. In the first instance, Angelo Matthews grassed a catch at slip off Sachith Pathirana's first delivery and the second life came when Akila Dhananjaya couldn't hold on to a tough chance at the deep third-man.India skipper Rohit Sharma was not able to reproduce his Mohali magic here as he fell in the fourth over after hitting a big six off Akila Dhananjaya.The leggie got his googly to come in sharply and deceive Sharma much to the disappointment of the crowd. The captain made just seven after having decimated the Lanka attack in Mohali with a brilliant double ton.Dhawan and Iyer made light of the early departure of their skipper and put on 135 runs in 19 overs to put India on the road to victory.Iyer, who scored his maiden ODI fifty at Mohali, hit a flurry of boundaries after a cautious start and hoisted Pathirana for six over long-on.Earlier, Sri Lanka suffered a dramatic collapse undoing the good work done by opener Upul Tharanga.Spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal shared three wickets each for India as Sri Lanka squandered a blistering start provided by Tharanga (95 off 82).The wicket offered decent turn for the spinners but the visitors failed to apply themselves, losing the last five wickets in the space of 18 runs and the last eight for 55 runs.Put in to bat by India captain Rohit Sharma, Sri Lanka were cruising with Tharanga and Sadeera Samarawickrama (42) sharing a 121-run stand for the second wicket after Danushka Gunathilaka (13) fell in the fourth over.Tharanga played some superb shots and was not afraid to hit aerial. The southpaw hit all his three sixes off Chahal, who otherwise was the best bowler on show with his drift and turn troubling the batsmen.Hardik Pandya came in as the first change bowler in the seventh over, replacing Bhuvneshwar Kumar. He was taken for 20 runs in his second over by Tharanga, who looked increasingly confident but got lucky on a few occasions.The seasoned Angelo Matthews, who walked in following Samarawickrama exit, put on 24 runs with Tharanga, before the left-hander was stumped by MS Dhoni off Kuldeep's bowling for 95.The opener, who missed out on a well-deserved ton, completed 1,000 runs for the calendar year during the course of the knock. Thereafter, it all went downhill for Sri Lanka.Both sides made one change each to their playing eleven with India bringing in Kuldeep in place of an ill Washington Sundar and Lanka replacing the misfiring Lahiru Thirimanne with Samarawickrama.
When other Porsche enthusiasts saw this gentleman cruising the country's Autobahnen and parked along the strasse with his custom rear wiper, the factory began receiving an increasing number of requests for similar installations. As a result, Porsche developed a retrofit kit and simultaneously began offering the rear wiper as a standard production option on 1966 models.
Yes, it's entirely possible to be privileged in all conventional ways and to still have a miserable, or at least dissatisfied, emotional life. The profile of young American men who resort to some form of attention-getting violence is remarkably similar: they're usually shunned, especially by girls. The combination of the invisibility they feel and the social rewards they think they're entitled to is a potent, dangerous one. David, on the other hand, has a girlfriend and access to friends for most of the book—but he deems himself worthy of a “better” girlfriend, “better” friends. The idea of a life that remains on the margins of the truly elite surrounding him is intolerable.
“I remember in the good ol' days, rodeo was an open-range competition. The eastern side of the Navajo Nation would put its best cowboy up against the best cowboy on the western side, and that is how the competition started. Today, rodeo is a professional sport and really a business for many Native Americans,” LA Williams says.
With their huge frames, McGowan and Armstead had obvious promise for Baylor's veer-inspired run game as OLs. Briles referred to McGowan as "2034," believing that by that year it'll be common for linemen to be this massive. But when the coaches observed McGowan playing catch with the QBs before practice, snagging bullets with a single paw, they realized that with some imagination he might be able to offer the offense something at a different position.
Generally what happens when a large person is running is that someone takes him out at the legs and those 400 pounds combine with gravity. And it's not that difficult for a responsible defender to keep a former offensive lineman from getting open, no matter how quick the big man is for his size.
Okay, it gets messy, even when you add two comparatively sane people with bass player Rehab (John Ales) and Johnny's girlfriend Ava (Elaine Hendrix).
But the truth is the horsemen were in the saddle well before the new operating system, which arrives on Wednesday. Consider:
In the same breath, many industry executives say it's finally time to get a plan together. "It had to get big enough to be an important issue, and I think we've reached that inflection point," said WPP Digital President and Xaxis Chairman David Moore, who also serves as chairman of the board of directors for the Interactive Advertising Bureau's Tech Lab.
SPOKANE, Wash / TORONTO, Ont. – Spokane Chiefs defenseman Ty Smith has been named to the 2018 Sherwin-Williams CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game, as announced on Wednesday, Dec. 13. The game, which will take place in Guelph, Ontario on Jan. 25, features the 40 top prospects from the CHL heading into next summer's 2018 NHL Entry Draft.
Smith, 17, is in his second year with the Chiefs after a dynamic rookie campaign during which he ranked 13th among all WHL rookies and 3rd among 16-year-olds with 32 points (5G-27A). His rookie year production ranked 2nd among 16-year-old defensemen in Chiefs franchise history.
Joseph Grano, who as a key figure in the merger between UBS and PaineWebber and now works as Chairman and CEO of Centurion Holdings, echoed Vienna's concerns.
“Donald's got to show us some depth,” warned Grano, who also served as Chairman of the Homeland Security Advisory Council. “If he doesn't start acting more presidential, and tone down the hyperbole and the rhetoric, he may get the [GOP] nomination, but I don't think he can win the presidency.”
Bert Sutcliffe, MBE, who died of emphysema on April 20, 2001, aged 77, was the outstanding New Zealand batsman of the immediate post-war period, though many in England who watched that other New Zealand left-hander, Martin Donnelly, in The Parks for Oxford might pursue counter-claims. Perhaps, as R. C. Robertson- Glasgow noted, "Sutcliffe had a more powerful case in his strokes to leg" whereas "in defence, Donnelly always looked the surer". The splendour of their off-side strokes was, needless to say, a given, and their brilliant fielding never ceased to excite attention, with Sutcliffe in his element whether at short leg, in the slips or at cover. Both made manifest again in that austere era some of the more charming cricketing images of the inter-war years.
Rothstein: The Lions did have a couple of strengths, starting with a potential Pro Football Hall of Famer in Calvin Johnson, who had 78 catches for 1,331 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2008. It was his second year in the league, the first of his seven 1,000-yard seasons and the first of his four double-digit touchdown seasons. He tied for the NFL lead in touchdown catches and was fifth in yards. It was actually the only time in Johnson's career he led the league in touchdowns. Detroit had some other nice pieces, including then-rookie defensive end Cliff Avril, who the Lions took in the third round of that year's NFL draft. Ernie Sims was a decent linebacker. Kicker Jason Hanson, who endured a lot of losing in his 327 career games with the Lions, had a fantastic season -- making 21 of 22 field goals, including all eight attempts from 50 yards or more; it was the second-best season, in terms of percentage of kicks made, of his career. The offensive line had some decent players in Dominic Raiola and Jeff Backus, but Backus was the only Lions lineman to start every game that season. Otherwise, the team had some major, major holes that took years to fill. Overall, it was not a very strong roster.

Trump responded the next day to Kim Jong-un's arcane insult with some standard name-calling. “Kim Jong-un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!” the president tweeted on Friday.
Small Forward: Either Lebron James or Chandler Parsons, depending on factors. We know why people hate LeBron, and there's literally an entire book about it, so we'll just gloss over how much his inclusion would turn public opinion away from Houston. Parsons, for his part, is moderately well-liked, but has his own share of image problems. Where once was a hard-nosed defense-first swingman now resides an offensive swiss army knife. The fact that he has the tools to play good defense and has even done so in past makes his struggles on that end all the harder to swallow. He's seem by some as preening, an image that his constant sneer on court (probably just due to how his face sits when he's exerting himself, if we're being honest), his endless hair-fixing during games and his budding modeling career. He's sort of a sex object, one of few in the NBA, and he knows it. THis might make him popular with some segments of the population, but don't be surprised that a lot of others hate him for it.

The particular target of Hoenig's ire in his above quoted NYT op-ed is the 1999 passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which tore down the wall between investment and commercial banking. The bill was named after its three main cosponsors: Sen. Phil Gramm, Rep. Jim Leach and Rep. Thomas Bliley. Since retiring from Congress, Gramm went on to become the president of the Swiss bank UBS AG and Bliley works as a registered lobbyist, often for financial interests. (Leach serves under President Obama as the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.)
The majority party in the House of Representatives often puts favored freshmen and sophomore lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee, the committee that oversees the financial sector, so that they can raise piles of money from Wall Street.
The freshmen congressmen appointed to the committee include the largest recipient of finance sector contributions among freshmen and a former bank lobbyist.
Aldous Huxley was known for his incredible books and essays, among them The Doors of Perception, a 1954 book discussing his experiences with mescaline, and Island, a novel about a utopian society. In Island, the citizens inhabit a constant state of acceptance thanks to meditation and a psychedelic agent they call “moksha medicine.” A character describes moksha as “the reality reliever, the truth-and-beauty pill,” allowing users to “catch a glimpse of the world as it looks to someone who has been liberated from his bondage to the ego.” Huxley was an elder statesman of the psychedelic movement, one who advocated the intelligent and cautious use of these chemicals to liberate the human spirit.
First, Kelly had to get his upperclassmen to buy into his program, a tall order as many of those players surely started to shift their focus from the team disappointments of failed campaigns that rounded out Weis' tenure to personal aspirations and doors opened by the rest of the Notre Dame experience.
But like a scene out of an old Western movie, Notre Dame's new four horsemen – Kelly, Diaco, recruiting coordinator and defensive backs coach Chuck Martin, and defensive line coach Mike Elston – rode into Monroe to reclaim what was once theirs, welcomed by the locals or otherwise.
“The new policy will emphasize de-escalation as an alternative to use of force and clarifies when force may be used," Department of Public Safety Spokeswoman Daelene Mix said.
New York didn't give up much in return. Mitchell was an up-and-down arm likely to settle into a swingman role long-term, though he remains under team control for six more years. The presence of David Phelps, Adam Warren, and Brett Marshall made him expendable. Farquhar was claimed off waivers from the Athletics last month and has been designated for assignment twice this year. He's an inconsequential throw-in. No word on the corresponding 40-man move yet, but I assume either Swisher (groin/hip) will be placed on the DL or Dewayne Wise will be designated for assignment. Ichiro will be in uniform tonight. Welcome to the Bronx.
The subway station at Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street? It is a historic landmark for the trench-coat set, Mr. Melton said. It is where a German spy, Erich Gimpel, was captured in 1944. Gimpel and William C. Colepaugh, an American traitor, arrived in Manhattan as would-be saboteurs. Their mission was to hang out in bars, eavesdrop on American servicemen and transmit what they learned to Germany.
The pro-Proposition 1 campaign is part of a resurgence of worker organizing across the country. Fast-food strikes have hit dozens of cities; autoworkers are unionizing in the low-wage South; fiercely independent lobstermen in Maine have already unionized. Labor organizers in SeaTac want to ride this wave.

“Of course the jail is the big draw,” said Forsyth Commission Chairman Pete Amos. “It's huge! We could have built it outside of town but why? I love it right here for everyone to admire. It's our masterpiece.”
Amos says the jail will draw people from all over. They'll come primarily to visit incarcerated relatives. Complementary businesses will pop up. Bail bondsmen and car impound lots are just a few the city hopes to welcome.
Witnesses to the fire on Kentucky Street saw the flames and rushed in to help 58-year-old Yul Atkins as the flames spread and helped pull the man to safety. Now, the man's girlfriend is in custody and accused of intentionally setting the fire.
"They banged on the door and they said they finally got the guy out and somebody to open the front door," Robinson said. "When they got him out they came and got me, the guy's girlfriend was doing CPR right on the front lawn there."
So regularly performed that you might almost call it old-school, this deceptively simple manoeuvre will surely have unseated the odd penny farthing rider in its time, perhaps even separated a fashionable gentleman on a velocipede from his top hat and teeth.
The rally begins at 4 p.m. Friday at Congressman Jim Clyburn's office located at 1225 Lady Street in downtown Columbia.
China has something of a difficult problem to solve in its financial sector: how to balance the growth of banking services outside the state owned and dominated banks and yet also how to make sure that the shadow banking system doesn't run away with itself and lead to some ghastly crash in the near to medium future. And that's without the problems of just out and out Ponzi schemes like eZubao. The problem being that the country and economy simply has to move its banking system away from the hugely wasteful and largely state directed system that has prevailed up until now and over to something much more market focused. But how are they to do that without all the cowboys charging in and making hay in a largely unregulated sector? Not just that, how do they stop even honest would be bankers from succumbing to irrational exuberance as our own banks did in 2004- 2008? Yes, I know, people shout that the US and European banks were all acting illegally and so on but really, they weren't. There was illegality in there, of course there was, there's illegality in every field of human endeavour. But our problems came from people being wrong, not their being criminal. And that is the problem that China faces.
Kim expressed satisfaction over the drills and said: “Any enemy group will never land in seashore of the country as our reliable artillerymen stand guard in full readiness to wipe out the aggressors,” KCNA Watch reported, citing the North Korean news agency. Kim also called for the training to be “intensified” among the units and sub-units of the Korean army according to the tactics set for coastal defense.

The hard-ball gamesmanship and casual character assassination of American politics sets the stage for this thriller from writer and director Rod Lurie. When the Vice President of the United States unexpectedly dies, all eyes in Washington D.C. are on President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) as he chooses a new VP. Sen. Jack Hathaway (William Petersen), a respected career politician enjoying a new swell of popularity after a well-publicized attempt to save a drowning woman, is expected to be Evans' choice, but instead he picks Sen. Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), a decision that raises eyebrows on both sides of the political fence. Veteran power broker Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) is vehemently opposed to Hanson's appointment, in part because the Democratic senator was once a Republican, and vows to do everything in his power to prevent her from being confirmed. Runyon and his staff start digging for dirt on Hanson, and soon make a surprising discovery — her personal morality is called into question when it's alleged that she took part in a group sexual liaison while she was a college student. The Contender also stars Mike Binder as one of Hanson's advisors, Mariel Hemingway as an old friend with a surprising secret, Christian Slater as an ambitious congressman assisting Runyon, and Philip Baker Hall as Hanson's father; it was the second feature from former film critic Rod Lurie.
A group of adventurous young friends on a trip to the Caribbean decide to explore a secluded island, where they unleash a highly contagious, flesh-eating virus after swimming in contaminated water, and exploring a research facility that houses a terrifying secret. Somewhere on an uncharted island deep in the Caribbean, the doctors at a secluded research lab have managed to quarantine Porter (Sean Astin), the first person to be infected by an aggressive flesh-eating virus. Meanwhile, not too far away, Marcus (Mitch Ryan) is preparing to get married when his brother Josh (Brando Eaton), Josh's girlfriend Penny (Jillian Murray), and their best friend Dobbs (Ryan Donowho) lure him onto a luxury yacht to celebrate his last night of freedom. Upon arriving at a picturesque island that isn't on the maps, Josh and Penny stay on the beach to do a little snorkeling while Marcus and Dobbs set up the campsite. Returning to the tent in a panic after spotting scores of dead fish in the water, Penny breaks out in a rash that Josh credits to some bad local ganja. Later, when Josh also shows signs of infection, Marcus and Dobbs venture out for help and break into the darkened research facility, which appears to have been the scene of a bloody struggle. Their worst fears are realized when they discover that they have stumbled upon the site of a deadly outbreak, and that the egomaniacal doctor (Currie Graham) in charge is determined to take credit for curing the disease — even if it means that no one gets off the island alive.
It currently looks as if Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will fall a little short of the $1 billion box office mark . However, a new rumor from Heroic Insider states that Warner Bros. is currently mulling whether to release the 3-hr director's cut in theaters, just before the Ultimate Edition is made available on home video. This move would pretty much guarantee that Batman v Superman crosses the $1 billion mark at the global box office as the same number of rabid fans who lined up to see DC Comics' Trinity grace the screen together for the first time are likely to let curiosity get the better of them and purchase tickets for the 3-hr director's cut.Do you think this strategy by Warner Bros. would hurt or help home video sales? From what we've seen of deleted scenes and heard from Zack Snyder in post-release interviews , the extended cut definitely pieces together some of the plot holes in the theatrical cut.
Texas Congressman Ron Paul, who was a close second to Bachmann on Saturday, has the support of nine percent (9%) of Likely Primary Voters, followed by Georgia businessman Herman Cain at six percent (6%) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich with five percent (5%). Rick Santorum, former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and ex-Utah Governor Jon Huntsman each get one percent (1%) support, while Michigan Congressman Thaddeus McCotter comes in statistically at zero.

1. I don't have to explain anything. Ball goes in net, good. Ball doesn't go in net, bad. Man gets card because he is bad. Easy peasy. Soccer fanboys will spend hours rhapsodizing about the nuances of pass sequences and the 4-1-3-1-1 vs. the 3-1-3-2-1, but kids give the zero-est of fucks about that. They just wanna know if someone scored—and that, thankfully, is all I need to explain. They will also then root for the team that's ahead, because children are all shameless frontrunners and are therefore the worst. My son specifically asks me which team is the favorite prior to every match so that he can choose a rooting interest. I may have him deported.
I have groused about overeager soccer fanboys on Twitter in the past just like any other patriotic American, but this is the year I have finally turned. This is the year I have stopped FIGHTING soccer and fallen in line, and I've genuinely enjoyed it. People talk about sports as a way of connecting with your children, but that's a romanticized pile of shit. I'm not looking for a connection. Christ, I've bonded with these people enough for two lifetimes. No, no, I am looking for a way of destroying boredom, or trying to figure out activities that are as fun for my children as they are for me. And this stupid game—with all of its flopping and bad hair and monumental levels of shoddy officiating—is doing the trick. I have dreams in my head of traveling to distant stadiums wearing dumb scarves and drinking pints with my older kids and hooliganing together and adopting some awful PREMM-EER league, uh, side that will fall apart just as I'm bandwagoning onto it, and I'm oddly looking forward to it.
The Watts riots, among the worst in U.S. history, resulted in a full-scale deployment of national guardsmen to subdue the unrest. Dorner noted that virtually nothing has changed since the blatant abuse of police power, writing, “The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days. It has gotten worse.”
The repeal of Obamacare appears to have hit some snags and the GOP brought out Trump earlier Tuesday to serve as pitchman to House Republicans who may have been wavering ahead of Thursday's vote. Whether he won votes or not is unclear, but markets certainly took the lack of clear majority support as a negative.
A major factor in Indiana's struggles last season was youth – the defense was stockpiled with freshmen and sophomores that were essentially thrown to the wolves. The end result was being gashed for big plays and giving up a handful of touchdowns – at least – each Saturday.
Fast forward one year and the Hoosiers welcome back 10 starters. The recruiting class also was heavy on defensive help, supplying depth for a unit that sorely needed it. Defensive linemen Darius Latham, Ralph Green and Bobby Richardson provide Indiana with a powerful trio up front.
The area's three freshmen legislators, meanwhile, will bring new ideas.
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele faces an all-but-impossible path to reelection this month, as a majority of the RNC's 168 members indicate that they will not support the controversial chairman for another term.
With eight months of Trump's presidency in the rear-view mirror, that possibility seems both quaint and laughable. Trump seems focused on destroying the idea of "acting presidential," glorying in the gasps and he-tweeted-whats that now happen on a near-daily basis. He believes -- I guess? -- that in acting the opposite of how we have long believed presidents are supposed to act, he is affirming his everyman credentials and sticking up for the little guy in the unending war against the elites.
When it comes to beating the climate change drum, Sen. Ed Markey is the Energizer Bunny. As a Congressman, Rep. Markey was Chairman of the now defunct House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming from 2007 to 2011. This time he is drumming on the education front.

He brought along the photos he had taken of Nastassja Kinski for Vogue.
One by one over the summer, various Republican figures declined to run for the seat, perhaps fearing a Democratic landslide in New York during a presidential-election year with an unpopular representative of the party in the White House. With Republicans unable to find a strong contender, former state assemblyman Robert Straniere stepped forward -- much to the chagrin of party leaders.

After David Gergen told Tapper that Donald Trump "needs to address" the fears of Soros-funded professional protesters whining about supposedly getting mean words hurled at them, Former Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston responded by citing an endless series of attacks on Trump supporters -- from the firebombing of the GOP headquarters in North Carolina to the recent beating of a "white Trump voter" by "African-American men" in Chicago.
Kudos to Former Congressman Jack Kingston for having the balls to speak the truth rather than falling all over himself to apologize for doing nothing wrong.
On March 10, Harm's Way will release its latest LP, Rust. Recorded with Andy Nelson (Weekend Nachos) at Bricktop Recordings, mixed by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou (High on Fire, Kvelertak) at GodCity Studios, and mastered by Brad Boatright (Nails, Old Man Gloom) at Audiosiege, the album finds Harm's Way at its tightest and most muscular (you can't talk Harms Way without talking muscles, or so the blogosphere's fixation on frontman James Pligge's physique would have you believe), carefully stripping away any extraneous noise or atmospherics to give way to pure, molten brutality. The music's considerable heft is heightened by Pliggue's lyrics that mix introspective gloom with world-weary struggle, loss, and death, and helped provide inspiration for the ambitious, multi-piece album art designed by E. Aaron Ross.

Happy's problem is that it has run out of water for its farms. Its population, dropping 10 per cent a year, is down to 595. The name, which brings a smile for miles around and plays in faded paint on the fronts of every shuttered business â€“ Happy Grain Inc, Happy Game Room â€“ has become irony tinged with bitterness. It goes back to the cowboy days of the 19th century. A cattle drive north through the Texas Panhandle to the rail heads beyond had been running out of water, steers dying on the hoof, when its cowboys stumbled on a watering hole. They named the spot Happy Draw, for the water. Now Happy is the harbinger of a potential Dust Bowl unseen in America since the Great Depression. ‘It was a booming town when I grew up,' Judy Shipman, who manages the bank, says. ‘We had three restaurants, a grocery, a plumber, an electrician, a building contractor, a doctor.

Now you can't farm the land.' – The Telegraph

Offensive linemen
We'll start here because it's the Lions' No. 1 problem spot, even though they've taken offensive linemen with their top pick twice in the past four years: Riley Reiff in 2012 and Laken Tomlinson this year (there's also Ebron, but he wasn't drafted for his blocking skills).
The good news is there are a lot of linemen — offensive and defensive — at the top of all the big boards:
Have you heard Ndamukong Suh isn't here anymore? The Lions didn't address that need high in this year's draft, so it might be time. And defensive linemen are at the top of the draft boards.
The next morning, I scoured the hip LoDo, or Lower Downtown Historic District, for Capitol-worthy fashion statements and found something quintessentially Western.

Re-signing or replacing third baseman Juan Uribe figures to be at or near the top of the Dodgers' to-do list at baseball's winter meetings, which start Monday in Florida.
That Uribe would find himself in this position would have been unthinkable a year ago, as he was coming off consecutive seasons in which he hit a combined .199. But a bounce-back 2013 season, coupled with a shortage of out-of-contract players at his position, have arguably made him the top third baseman on the free-agent market.

Kenneth and Christine Penmark dote on their eight-year-old daughter Rhoda. They say their farewells to Kenneth before he leaves on military duty. The Penmarks' neighbor and landlady, Monica Breedlove, comes in with presents for Rhoda—a pair of sunglasses and a locket. Rhoda, pristine and proper in her pinafore dress and long, blonde pigtails, thanks Monica for the gifts. She dances in tap shoes and tells Monica about a penmanship competition that Rhoda lost to her schoolmate, Claude Daigle; Monica speaks of it as a childish disappointment, but Rhoda's face darkens with fury. Christine and Rhoda leave for the school picnic at a nearby lake.
Later, Christine is having lunch with Monica and friends when they hear a radio report that a child has drowned in the lake where Rhoda's school was having their picnic. Christine worries that the drowned child could be her daughter, but a follow-up report identifies the victim as the same Claude who had won the penmanship medal. Relieved that Rhoda is alive, Christine worries that her daughter might be traumatized by seeing the boy's corpse. When Rhoda returns home, however, she is unfazed by the incident and goes about her daily activities.
When Christine later finds the penmanship medal in Rhoda's room, she demands an explanation. Rhoda lies that Claude let her have the medal after she won a bet. Soon Christine's father arrives for a visit. Long haunted by distant and confusing memories about her own childhood, Christine talks with her father, who finally reveals that he is not her biological parent, that she was adopted by him and his wife. Already upset by this revelation, Christine is then horrified to learn that she is actually the daughter of a notorious serial killer. She now worries that her own origin is the cause of Rhoda's sociopathy, and that Rhoda's behavior is genetic, not subject to influence or reversal by good parenting or a wholesome environment.
Rhoda's father brings her home from the hospital and puts her to bed, but during a thunderstorm in the middle of the night, Rhoda puts on her rain gear and sneaks out of the apartment. Her father is awakened by a call from the hospital, where Christine has regained consciousness. She begs her husband for forgiveness and tells him she loves him. Meanwhile, walking through the heavy rain, Rhoda finally arrives at the lake and walks out onto the pier, determined to retrieve the penmanship medal. She finds a long metal pole with a fishnet, and she uses it to probe the surrounding water. Next, a bolt of lightning is seen, implying that she has been struck and killed, putting an end to her evil.

The author, who received a Pulitzer prize for a biography of Martin Luther King Jr, also claims that “Obama wrote somewhat elusively” to a girlfriend “that he had thought about and considered gayness but ultimately decided that a same-sex relationship would be less challenging and demanding than developing one with the opposite sex”.

Caveman
Even if you choose to view every moment between the pilot and the ultimate confrontation as a riotous kind of detour between shootouts, remember as you watch Raylan's and Boyd's boot heels marking their final steps in this pattern that this all spiraled from one moment of mercy in March 2010, when a dead-shot Deputy U.S. Marshal deliberately missed the heart of his target because they'd dug coal together once upon a time. Remember that Raylan let Boyd go again, in pursuit of the Miami shooter who'd felled Boyd's father, whose location Boyd had given up to Raylan to save his brother's widow (who was widowed, of course, on account that she'd shot him). Remember that Boyd once picked a fight with Raylan to get back into prison so he could shake down Dickie Bennett for his mama's fortune. Remember that Raylan's own father all but adopted Boyd in place of his actual son and gunned down another lawman thinking he was Raylan.

Raskin's bill would allow the four Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate to each choose a psychiatrist and another doctor. Then each party would add a former statesman — like a retired president or vice president. The final group of 10 would meet and choose an 11th member, who would become the committee's chairman. Once the group is officially seated, the House and Senate could direct it through a joint resolution to conduct an actual examination of the president "to determine whether the president is incapacitated, either mentally or physically," according to the Raskin bill. In the case of Raskin's plan, the Constitution holds that both houses of Congress would hold a vote within three weeks. If two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate agreed that the president couldn't discharge his duties, he would be dismissed.

5. Don't go for the kill. This could mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. So I will just explain it like this, a gentleman is patient. With whatever you are dealing with, whether it be a first date or you are out with a group of friends, a gentleman is patient. He doesn't try to force anything and he doesn't have a hidden agenda that he is trying to accomplish. Just be patient.
11. A woman is a woman, treat them all the same. You wife, girlfriend, mother, sister and grandmother. They are all women so you should act accordingly. Open the car door for your mother and don't be afraid to compliment your sister. It may be weird, but being a gentleman is weird these days anyways.
21. Spread the floor. The spotlight doesn't always need to be on you. Admittedly, I enjoy being the center of attention at the dinner table when I am out with a group of friends, but don't hog the stage. If you have that personality type that attracts people to yourself, use it to shine the light on the other people. It is not that you can't be the the center of attention, it is that a gentleman is humble and confident enough to share the floor.
26. Grab the check. Right away. Don't let there be that awkward moment of “Are we going to split it or?” Just grab it. Some people can't afford it, trust me I understand that, but we need to think about those things before invite someone out to dinner. A gentleman are prepared to cover the tab before he invites someone out to eat. If they really want to split it with you and you are okay with that, then split it. But, be prepared pay.
Now, I don't care to discuss the alleged complaints American Indians have against this country. I believe, with good reason, the most unsympathetic Hollywood portrayal of Indians and what they did to the white man. They had no right to a country merely because they were born here and then acted like savages. The white man did not conquer this country. And you're a racist if you object, because it means you believe that certain men are entitled to something because of their race. You believe that if someone is born in a magnificent country and doesn't know what to do with it, he still has a property right to it. He does not. Since the Indians did not have the concept of property or property rights--they didn't have a settled society, they had predominantly nomadic tribal "cultures"--they didn't have rights to the land, and there was no reason for anyone to grant them rights that they had not conceived of and were not using. It's wrong to attack a country that respects (or even tries to respect) individual rights. If you do, you're an aggressor and are morally wrong. But if a "country" does not protect rights--if a group of tribesmen is the slaves of their tribal chief--why should you respect the "rights" that they don't have or respect? The same is true for a dictatorship. The citizens in it have individual rights, but the country has no rights and so anyone has the right to invade it, because rights are not recognized in that country; and no individual or country can have its cake and eat it too--that is, you can't claim one should respect the "rights" of Indians, when they had no concept of rights and no respect for rights. But let's suppose they were all beautifully innocent savages--which they certainly were not. What were they fighting for, in opposing the white man on this continent? For their wish to continue a primitive existnece; for their "right" to keep part of the earth untouched--to keep everybody out so they could live like animals or cavemen. Any European who brought with him an element of civilization had the right to take over this continent, and it's great that some of them did. The racist Indians today--those who condemn America--do not respect individual rights.
Kimmel: “Just grasping the positioning. I know when I transitioned from junior to officiating,” said Kimmel, “[the toughest part was] just understanding the positioning of the game. You have a grasp of the rules, the behavior, and the management of the game but those basic fundamentals of positioning as a linesman and as a referee – those are all things we go through in the camp. We start off with some classroom, some video and some presentations from some of our staff about positioning, and then we get out on the ice and go through it very slowly so the guys can grasp it. Then we get into some pick-up games where these young players have opportunities to be involved both as linesmen and as referees and get a feel for whether they have some interest in pursuing [officiating] in the future.”
In addition to the 46 amateur officials attending the camp, the NHL also invited 27 of their top minor prospects to act as mentors, answer questions, and provide guidance to the young officials both on and off the ice. Those included linesman Devin Berg, who was recently signed by the NHL for the 2015-16 season.
Potential referees and linesmen were treated to a weekend that included presentations from NHL officials Wes McCauley, Paul Devorski, Brad Kovachik, and Steve Kozari. It made for a memorable time with a lot of lessons learned by its participants.
In 1918, Australian marine biologist David Stead recorded events when local fisherman refused to go back out to sea after witnessing an incredibly large creature.

The fishermen described it as between 35 and 90 meters long and pure white in color.

Susan reporting:Just when I'm sure I can ball-park date and identify most Western historic dress, an item pops up that makes me realize I know NOTHING. This helmet looks like some modern steam-punk extravaganza, or a wizard's costume from amovie.It's hard to believe that this helmet is almost 500 years old, and was created as part of a lavish suit of court armor of Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian I. The armor was then presented by Maximllian to English King Henry VIII, the sort of lavish gift that Renaissance rulers exchanged to cement alliances.Only this helmet now survives. Originally it would have had a silver-gilt panels of pierced work that would have fit over the skull and over a flowing purple velvet headpiece. Such a fantastic suit of armor would have been worn for pageants and parades rather than combat. Even so, the helmet with his gilt eye-pieces is so unusual that for many years, it was misidentified as having belonged to Henry's jester, Will Somers, rather than to the king himself.But ever-competitive Henry was impressed by the high craftsmanship of the armor, superior to anything English armorers were making at the time. Determined not to be outdone in monarchical display, he gathered the best armorers available from Germany, Flanders, and Italy to a new workshop at his palace at Greenwich, where royal armor was created until the mid-17th century.The helmet is now a prized possession of the.

Fisherman with a silver carp
Silver carp, with the closely related bighead carp, often reach extremely high population densities, and are thought to have undesirable effects on the environment and native species.[6] They have spread into the Mississippi, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, and Missouri Rivers and many of their tributaries in the United States and are abundant in the Mississippi River watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota and Illinois. Navigation dams seem to have slowed their advance up the Mississippi River, and until late November 2008, silver carp had not been captured north of central Iowa on the Mississippi.[11] Dams that do not have navigation locks are complete barriers to upstream natural movement of silver carp, unless fishermen unintentionally assist this movement by the use of silver carp as bait.[4]
In 2007, South Dakotan Heather Morijah and her boyfriend got his-and-hers license plates. His said “IMPCH W” and hers read “MPEACHW.” A few months later, Morijah got a letter from the DMV stating that she had to surrender the plate within 10 days due to complaints. On the advice of her lawyer, Morijah went to the media. The DMV refused to back down, publicly stating that they might be forced to make law enforcement collect the plates if she wouldn't give them up voluntarily. That's when the national media got involved, including CNN. The ACLU of the Dakotas sent the DMV a letter about censoring political speech, and miraculously, the decision was reversed a couple of days later.

It doesn't stop there. Derek Wolfe has been a force of nature, while fellow defensive lineman Malik Jackson has pushed the pocket all season. Carolina has jumped out to massive leads in their past two games, but that won't be so easy against Denver's active and vicious front seven.
Lou Sleater was a swingman for most of his early career, before settling into the bullpen in 1955 at the age of 28. As a hitter, through 1956, he had compiled a .197/.228/.224 line in 79 plate appearances. On May 30, 1957 Sleater launched his first career homer, a tenth-inning walkoff game-winner versus Wally Burnette. It was only the second extra-inning walkoff homer hit by a pitcher in Play Index history (1945 forward).
The Republican primary, meanwhile, could be a crowded affair. State Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R-Somerset) and businessman Joseph Rullo are the only declared candidates, though Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno is expected to launch a bid and Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick (R-Union) hasn't ruled out running.
The relative Jakobsson is living with gave evidence after reporting him to police over eight breaches, telling the court he had been out with his girlfriend and new friends.
The ENFORCE Act is similar to other Republican bills that have been proposed over the last few months. This latest version was introduced this week by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), and it's supported by House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.).
ADO will be the happier side although more clinical finishing could have won them the game, particularly early in the second half. Their style of play is based on the old adage of cropping space in defense and stretching play in possession and they do this very well. Manager John van den Brom spent his first three coaching years at Ajax' youth and the Ajax way of thinking is reflected in his approach. The 4-3-3 wide winger system is a clear example of course, but he has adapted this style well to suit his current squad. Reverting the midfield triangle, making the arrow point backwards and installing an anchorman in front of defense reflects the fact that Van den Brom smartly adjusts his philosophy to the strength of the squad he's managing. ADO's current eighth spot is quite something for an Eredivisie manager making his debut.
He and his girlfriend even worked a few late nights with them assembling the pens for shipping.

After I cut the sleeves to length, I unpinned them and used them as templates against the back of the shirt. My gracious girlfriend ran her sewing machine through the elbow-side ends (sleeve characters on the inside), then ran it through all four layers of fabric for some extra toasty warmness. The inside liner would make adding things like pockets a bit easier, which I'll probably add soon, or make another pair with a set of pockets installed before the final stitching-up.
We also found that with very few exceptions, black women were murdered not by strangers but by men known to them -- most often by intimate partners. When the relationship between the victim and offender could be identified, 92 percent of black females knew their killers. Within that group, 56 percent were wives, common-law wives, ex-wives, or girlfriends of their killers.
Why he fits: Goodwin came up coaching offensive lines, which is nice for a Rams team that drafted seven offensive linemen from 2014-15 and has yet to see results. While he was in Pittsburgh, the Steelers frequently had strong running games. In Arizona, he helped spark the resurgence of quarterback Carson Palmer. The Cardinals improved 20 spots, from 32nd to 12th, in total offense in Goodwin's first year as offensive coordinator in 2013. In 2015, they had the best offense in the NFL.
Why he fits: Vrabel has far more playing experience than anybody on this list, having spent 14 years as a linebacker for the Steelers, Patriots and Chiefs. After his playing career ended, Vrabel rose quickly as a coach, spending three years coaching linebackers and defensive linemen at his alma mater and then spending three years coaching linebackers for the Texans, where he helped develop Jadeveon Clowney and Benardrick McKinney. Now he's getting coaching interviews. Vrabel is considered an excellent teacher and motivator.
Great business ideas often come from strange places, but no one expects to find one at the bottom of a river. Yet that's what happened to George Goodwin. When he went fishing in shallow Florida riverbeds during the early 1970s, Goodwin often caught more logs than bass. "I used to snag my lures on them," he remembers. Most fishermen would have cursed their luck; Goodwin, now 59, reeled in a multi-million-dollar business instead.
CLEVELAND – Alan Anderson joined the Washington Wizards on Monday for their trip to Cleveland and took shots after his teammates completed shoot-around Tuesday morning. The 33-year-old swingman also said he plans on taking part in on-court activity on Wednesday for the first time since undergoing surgery on his left ankle on Oct. 13.
When he does return, Anderson will provide a much-needed defensive presence and depth. Washington had just 10 available players in its loss to the Toronto Raptors on Saturday, which prompted the team to waive swingman Martell Webster and sign center Ryan Hollins on Monday.
Other possible FBI Director candidates include former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, former Deputy FBI Director John Pistole, and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
James Whitford, Ball State head coach. This would be an extremely long-term play, with Whitford having presided over a 5-25 first season on the sideline with a very young Cardinals team in 2013-14. (Ball State had four freshmen playing major roles.) But he's a Madison native and a 1994 Wisconsin graduate, and he served as a manager on the basketball team for three seasons. He has a solid coaching pedigree, too, as a longtime aide to Arizona coach Sean Miller; Whitford was Miller's associate head coach in Tucson before taking over at Ball State. Turning around that program could turn heads at his alma mater, but Whitford has to make that happen first.
We like to do this weird thing where we wear cotton pajamas styled after feudal Japanese clothing and throw each other around on rubber padding. We give each other colored strips of fabric to wrap around our waists so we can show how good we are at this odd activity.

It grabbed one by his head and killed another before a guide could finally get a shot off and kill the bear. The tour company was later criticized for their negligence: the explosive trip wire meant to warn people of bears failed and there was no night watchman on duty.

Meanwhile, on the backend, Jacob Trouba has thrived from day one with the Jets. The former Michigan Wolverine jumped into the lineup and has displayed the ability to log big minutes. He led all rookies with time on ice per game while averaging 22:36 per night. Not too shabby for a 20 year old. Though Trouba primarily focused on his defensive responsibilities he wasn't one to shy away from a chance to get involved offensively. He proved this by finishing tied for 11th in rookie scoring with 29 points (10G & 19A). Trouba's ability to play in all situations is impressive considering this was his rookie season. All signs indicate he is on the path to have a successful NHL career and be a franchise NHL defenceman in the years to come.
I do not believe in a team being better than their record. That sort of chatter tends to be brought up a lot here in Winnipeg. There are a lot of unrealistic expectations with this Winnipeg Jets team. Lets say it how it is: This team did not have a chance to compete for a playoff spot. The lineup was not built to compete in the West. Cheveldayoff failed to put together a team with talent throughout the lineup. When Mark Scheifele was injured this become very apparent. Olli Jokinen could not step in and fulfill the duties as the second line centre, creating a gaping whole at the centre. The team lacked depth at forward. Due to the lack of depth the Jets had to play three lines and then fatigue came into play. The defenceman and goaltending need some work as well. Cheveldayoff needs to become less reluctant to make a move this offseason.
With Stokes, Woakes and Jos Buttler all skipping the two-match one-day series with Ireland on 5 and 7 May and to remain playing in the Indian Premier League, two batsmen who have struggled to crack what is a competitive line-up, Sam Billings and Jonny Bairstow, will surely get the chance to play at Bristol and Lord's.
That was Orr in 1967-68, when in his second NHL season he won his first Norris Trophy as top defenceman on the strength of 46 games played in a 74-game regular season.
3. Should playing on a non-playoff team disqualify a defenseman from winning the Norris Trophy?
It is worth pointing out that many Doughty supporters will cite this as a reason why the Kings' defenceman is a better choice this season than Ottawa's Karlsson, though it must be noted that in voting last year, even though Karlsson won the Norris, Doughty had more first-place votes in a season in which the Kings didn't make the playoffs.
Panellists were told they‎ could write in any defenceman of their choice if they believed someone other than Doughty or Karlsson warranted the award.
It was interesting that one Hall of Famer went with Pittsburgh Penguin defenceman Kris Letang. Others went out of their way to laud San Jose's Brent Burns, too, but no one could see their way clear to put Burns ahead of Doughty or Karlsson.
Toronto Community Housing will see at least one more senior-level manager leave before the end of the week, the Star has learned. An announcement is expected as early as Wednesday and follows Friday's news that CEO and president Gene Jones had left as part of an agreement with the board for a change in leadership. The decision came after a scathing report from the city's ombudsman on troubling human resources practices.
Anand Maharaj, vice president of human resources, is among the TCHC executives who came in for criticism in Toronto ombudsman Fiona Crean's report, though described only by title.
Since Friday the board has been engaged in private and public discussions about ombudsman Fiona Crean's report, released last week. Friday's talks focused solely on Jones, according to a source, but on Monday board members turned the discussion to other staff. Crean's report highlights inconsistent hiring practices, pay hikes without evaluations and staff improperly promoted through the ranks. She called it an “abject failure of leadership from the top” with “senior executives ignoring policy and running an organization as though it were their own personal fiefdom.”
Last week, Mayor Rob Ford actively defended Jones, calling — appearing at the board's announcement after he admitted to lobbying members on Jones' behalf. He called Crean's report “biased.” “This is one of the worst days in Toronto's history,” Ford told reporters. “The ombudsman —she's the one who should resign, she's the one who's political.”
Silvio Bersusconi (who must have enjoyed watching the implosion at PD) played the senior statesman last night, telling reporters that:
Ricky Watters' "For whom, for what?!" diatribe was a bad omen to start 1995 (and nowhere near as entertaining as the legendary story of Watters' undersized girlfriend cussing out offensive coordinator Jon Gruden the same day). Ray Rhodes erupted into an obscenity-laced speech following the opening day loss to the Giants in 1997, with the edited TV version blaring more bleeps than audible words.

But right now, it appears unlikely that two weeks will be enough time to work out a spending plan to ensure that the government stays open through the end of the fiscal year in September. Republican leaders are under intense pressure from freshmen elected with tea party support to press for deep budget reductions. Democrats respond that those reductions will snuff out jobs at a time when the United States badly needs them.
Congressman Ron Paul's third-place finish in Tuesday's Iowa Republican Caucus was a remarkably strong showing for a candidate who has so little in common with mainstream Republicans. Perhaps the nation's most politically unique congressman, Paul shares policy stances with conservatives, liberals, and libertarians, while differing markedly from all of them.
Taking a lesson from the Queen in Alice in Wonderland, America's top two military commanders have already pronounced Manning guilty. Almost a year ago, President Obama, the commander-in-chief, pronounced Manning guilty saying "He broke the law." Just recently the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, echoed that finding of guilt before trial saying "He did break the law." Dempsey's comment was published in Stars and Stripes , the official newspaper of the Department of Defense. It seems like the military is doing all they can to let everyone who serves on the jury know their career is over if Manning is found not guilty.
It is unclear how Judge Col. Denise Lind will minimize the impact of command influence in the Manning case. She can tell the jurors to ignore the Commander-in-Chief and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs statements that Manning "broke the law," but will that just make matters worse?
Chairman Earl Devaney's Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board proved this is possible. Starting in 2009, the Recovery Board applied data standards to track stimulus spending. Our members' software used that data to help inspectors general prevent and recover over $100 million in spending on suspicious grantees and contractors. The DATA Act applies that approach across the whole of government spending.
The last paragraph of this rubbish piece is about a Dutch professor named Kees van der Pijl. The MH17 truthers seem to have been ordered to mention van der Pijl in their fake news blogs. It again shows the weakness of the pro Russian fanboys as Kees van der Pijl tell the same nonsense which is easily debunked. Van der Pijl recently delivered a presentation. Part of the presentation was on MH17. My blog about the presentation here.

Public outcry accused the FCC of abandoning its commitment to net neutrality, and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler agreed to consider revising proposed rules.
Coming out of halftime, Hill had a conventional three-point play to slice the deficit to a half-dozen, but North Dakota followed with a 9-2 spurt to fend off any shift in game flow. Freshman Leah Szabla scored a jumper then finished on a fastbreak layup to push the lead back to double digits where it remained throughout.
On our final day, we rode horses through the forest to an abandoned mine with Owen Davies, another exceptional guide. During the winter months, when Clayoquot is closed, Davies pans for gold, extracting tiny particles from the river with a sluice box, a pan, and anachronistic patience. Wearing a cowboy hat, a plaid shirt, and weathered chaps, he completely looked the part of the rugged prospectors who once scoured the valley. Breathing the damp, earthen must, we followed a vein of quartz down into the mine shaft, where our flashlights sent crickets scattering away, and emerged to a blast of fresh air and a burst of light.
In the afternoon, we traced the city's veins of Asian culture to the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden, in Chinatown. Built in the 1980s, largely by 52 craftsmen using only Ming dynasty tools and materials from their home city of Suzhou, the garden occupies a mere third of an acre, but with a pond glittering with koi, a drooping willow tree, and serene pavilions edging the courtyard, its presence is expansive. I noticed my father's demeanor lighten. He listened raptly as Anita Huang, our Taiwan-born guide, described the careful consideration that resulted in this faithful interpretation of a 15th-century scholar's garden. She pointed out the Corsican mint growing spontaneously from cracks in the cobblestone. “After it rains,” she told us, “the entire place is perfumed like mint tea.” My father looked over at me. Without a word, I knew it reminded him of the wild mint growing around our house in the Catskills.
Looking ahead, the picture doesn't change.The nomination of Hillary Clinton is said by many to be all but assured. And as with all the other candidates, when seeking office in an oligarchy, one must look for where one can get the biggest bang for the buck. Why contact a million people for a few dollars each, when one can contact just a few people to obtain millions from each? Mrs. Clinton knows this well. One of her most ardent fans is a gentleman by the name of Haim Saban, who holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship.
"We should take swift action to provide some reasonable restrictions on this type of unreasonable practice," Congressman Michael Costello told the Boston Globe newspaper.
Ours can be an overly polite country. If the recent Senate spending scandal taught us anything, it's the value of openness in financial relations. Our American neighbors have come to understand this (somewhat), and now believe that such transparency should not be confined to Congressmen or Wall Street. Lost in the rancor surrounding the Affordable Care Act is a piece of legislation that leans on transparency to enlighten and safeguard patients from conflicts of interest. It's titled the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and it's a rather unapologetic take on a relationship Canada has been relatively bashful about.
There was no answer, but at 9 p.m., a full 11 hours after the hearing began, committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., brought it to a close.
AFL President Jim Foster asked former Redskins offensive lineman and then-Commandos director of player development George Starke to lead a group of investors to buy the team. Starke and former teammate Mark Moseley worked together to use their name and popularity in the city to keep the Commandos around but alas, it was to no avail.
A member of the Smurfs and the Fun Bunch, Brown caught eight touchdowns as a first-year player during the 1981 season, helping the Redskins win Super Bowl XVII. He compiled 1,225 yards and caught eight touchdowns the next season to lead Washington to its second consecutive Super Bowl appearance. After an injury-plagued 1984 season, the Redskins traded Brown to the Atlanta Falcons for offensive lineman R. C. Thielemann. After three seasons in Atlanta, Brown never played another down in the NFL.

R-Kal Truluck attended Redskins training camp in 1997, impressing as an edge rusher in the AFL. He earned AFL rookie of the year in 2001 and was named lineman of the year in 2002. He played four seasons in the NFL before making a comeback to the AFL in 2008. At age 38 he started two games with the Orlando Predators in 2013.
Before officially changing his name to Stylez G. White in 2008, defensive lineman Greg White spent time with the Redskins in 2003 and 2004. As a member of the Predators in 2007, he earned defensive player of the year by setting the AFL's single-season record with 15 sacks.
Current Redskins offensive lineman Ty Nsekhe established himself on 50-yard fields before making it to the NFL. When he wasn't busy plowing defenders over walls, Nsekhe actually caught three touchdown passes with the Philadelphia Soul in 2011. “The AFL taught me how to be a pro,” he said.
Sun and his 36-year-old boyfriend tried to register for marriage on 23 June, on their one-year anniversary. But they were turned away by an official, who said only ‘one man and one woman' could register. Sun then filed a lawsuit against the bureau on 16 December. Sun told Chinese media that he knew he was gay at 14. When he first told his family, he said they looked down on him. […] After learning her son was ready to get married, his mother said: ‘No matter how society discriminates against my son because he is gay, I will stand firmly by him.' [Source]
The half-hour episode titled ‘Rainbow' features a soldier who has broken up with his boyfriend outside of camp.
Cuyahoga's troubles burst into public view on a July day five years ago, when 175 federal agents searched offices and seized documents across the county. Their investigation—and subsequent trials—has made clear just how pervasive corrupt practices were in the county. School district treasuries were raided, contracts were handed over in exchange for bribes, and a disturbing number of county employees held no-show or redundant jobs because they were friends, or friends of friends, or girlfriends of individuals with political connections. “People who aren't from around here don't understand how deep it went,” says Michael Gallagher, a member of the county council. “It went to the root.”
Tamra Judge is soon about to become a "Tam-Ma" and the Real Housewives of Orange County star feted her son and his expectant fiancée with a cowgirl themed bash this past weekend.
Tamra pulled out all the stops for the themed baby shower: pink cowboy boots festooned the tent, bales of hay provided seating, and a photo booth included props like horseshoe-shaped glasses.
Spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement: “Given that President and Mrs. Obama will be in Washington for at least another two and a half years, it made sense for them to buy a home rather than continuing to rent property.”
McCarthy, Greene, defensive line coach Mike Trgovac and three scouts couldn't recall a 295-pound defensive lineman reducing to Neal's weight and succeeding as an outside linebacker.
In two games, all 24 of Neal's snaps as a defensive lineman have been exclusively as an inside sub rusher. He's too light now to be a base end, anyway.
“It reads so well. We're very proud of this book. We worked with a gentleman to help us because two clowns like us really couldn't put pen to paper this well. Brian, we give our colleague all the credit for how it reads,” he said.
Immediately, US Congressman Ron Paul expressed his vociferous opposition to the new sanctions and vilified them as “an act of war”, saying that the US is marching into war with Iran.

While the knee-jerk reaction among many Republicans would be to dismiss the idea that the state could be competitive in 2016 -- just four years after Mitt Romney carried it by 16 points over President Obama -- Texas GOP Chairman Steve Munisteri is in no mood to sneer.
Munisteri said that he has had recent discussions with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus about the need to prepare for a significant change in the political dynamic here, noting that the need will likely become even more pressing in the next decade. That's when Texas is expected to see its minority population rise more sharply -- as it adds as many as four additional electoral votes to make it an even shinier target for Democrats than it already is.
The gestatorial chair ( sedia gestatoria [ˈsɛːdja dʒestaˈtɔːrja] in Italian , lit. "chair for carrying") was a ceremonial throne on which Popes were carried on shoulders until 1978, and later replaced outdoors in part with the Popemobile . It consists of a richly adorned, silk-covered armchair, fastened on a suppedaneum , on each side of which are two gilded rings; through these rings pass the long rods with which twelve footmen ( palafrenieri ), in red uniforms, carry the throne on their shoulders. On prior occasions, as in the case of Pope Stephen III , popes were carried on the shoulders of men. [1]
The US President travels to Afghanistan--which has been occupied by more than tens of thousands of American and NATO troops--but he does not dare step out of Bagram Airfield, which is an American military base. He did not arrange a single meeting with any of the Afghan statesmen in Kabul or other areas. He stayed within the confines of the military base, and he did not take one step out until it was time for him to return home. You [Mr. President] are afraid of the majority of the people. You are afraid of nations's majority. Today you are even afraid of your own people's majority--in the USA. One proof is the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement, which is not be limited to New York City. In various other cities of the USA the people are expressing their contempt. Therefore, you are isolated.
A pictorial code for sportsmanship at its finest, but just what did Andrew Flintoff say to Brett Lee after closest of finishes at Edgbaston? © Getty Images
England's celebrations were joyously uncoordinated, with players running in different directions before they eventually came together. Harmison broke off from the celebrations to console Lee and then Flintoff did the same, his face a picture of compassion, respect and empathy. The result was one of cricket's iconic photographs, a pictorial code for sportsmanship at its finest.
Last year's merger commitment to bring 60Mbps speeds to two million new residential and small business locations included a pledge that at least one million of those would be in areas served by at least one other high-speed provider. This condition was designed to increase competition. But new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is planning to eliminate the "overbuilding" requirement while keeping the overall requirement of two million locations in place.
2016 CSU Storylines: Defensive front The Rams graduated four starters from the defensive line a year ago, looking for new bodies in the 3-4 set to step into the roles. Here are some key numbers to consider: Stats — CSU's defense ranked 106th against the rush (213.3 yards per game) and 80th in sacks (24 total) in 2015. Returning — Nobody on the line, though Josh Lovingood has eight career starts. The Rams are looking at a number of backups or first-time players to fill the gaps at the point of attack. Sizing it up — There isn't a returning defensive lineman who had a sack last season. While the nose guard candidate are all 300 pounds or bigger, the rest of the front is considered undersized (270 or less), meaning the Rams will have to be active up front to create problems.

The 31-year-old pop tart has been spotted multiple times lately with her reported new boyfriend David Lucado. Just this week, Spears and Lucado made two visits to Forever Bella tanning salon in Thousand Oaks, California, and shuttled sons Jayden James and Sean Preston to gymnastics class in L.A.

Mr Hopkins is alleged to have sent her a message praising her for being “sweet and good natured” before adding that a “nice young man would be lucky to have you as a girlfriend and lover…Were I to be young.”
Quality is usually a pressing issue among B2B service providers due to the particular problem of setting up an effective lead prospecting and lead scoring database. Manpower proficiency has been the common culprit, but the problem usually demands investment in an efficient system that accurately gauges audience interests and undertakes interaction-based scoring.
Tuesday is the team's usual day off, but the Vikings did release offensive lineman Isame Faciane from the practice squad, less than a week after he was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in St. Louis Park .
“Not fair and not adequate on such an important issue,” the Senate's third-ranking Democrat told Chairman Orrin Hatch. “Not fair. Not fair. And you are a fair-minded man.”
His next novel will be biographical fiction based on the 19th century Dalit Namasudra messiah of undivided Bengal, Harichand Thakur. Byapari says it is likely be his last novel. For the past one year, his salary has been withheld at a school for deaf and mute children in Kolkata where he would cook for Rs200 per day. The school administration, he alleges, is run by CPM workers who have been victimizing him since 2000—that is when the cover of pen names like Madan Dutta, Jijibisha and Arun Mitra, which he used to oppose the then Communist government's policies on Singur and Nandigram, was blown. “They realized that the enemy is within them. I'm struggling to earn a living now and surviving on the patronage of a gentleman supporting me till my next novel comes out," says Byapari. “Some people will donate and I will buy a toto to ferry passengers again."

The list had included journalists such as Enrico Mentana and crusading anti-Mafia reporter Roberto Saviano as well as executives such as Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann. One of its subtitles read "the Jewish monopoly in the mass media in Italy" and the page also included links to documents alleging Jewish influence in the country.
My girlfriend [Amy “Bingo” Bingaman] wanted to go see The Wall for her birthday and I didn't want to go . . . but instead I had Whiskey Girl and Nowhere Man [perform it]. They learned the entire f*cking thing and did it at our house for a surprise party. They had a full band, even the bullhorn parts. [Laughs] They learned the entire album just for her birthday. Just f*cking amazing.
World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., or the WWE, has previously not been known as the kind of company that is forward-looking in their business model efforts. The purveyors of professional wrestling made many lists of companies in support of SOPA and CISPA, while CEO and frontman Vince McMahon has, in the past, been quite lawsuit-happy when it comes to even the most modest relation to company trademarks. All this was done as the company dragged its feet more doggedly than any other sports entertainment company in holding onto their now-iconic pay-per-view business model. Even as they signed more and more network and cable television deals, those broadcasts all seemed to be chiefly used to push fans towards live events and the big events broadcasted solely on PPV.
Tre is actually a legacy, his last name deriving from the fact that he is descended from the second Dread Pirate Roberts2. To this day, Tre's family carries a deep pride in their roots and strong aversion to Princes and Humperdinks and the offensive lineman is noticeably more effective when coaches tell him opposing players are Florinese.

The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (Pakistani Taliban) has claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was in revenge for an anti-terrorist military offensive. Spokesman Muhammad Khorasani said it was “just the trailer” to further attacks.
The battle against the militants still raged nearby on Saturday, however, as a Reuters cameraman visited the site with Iraqi troops.
Connections to Yeat's original are even more tenuous when his lines crop up in comics, pulp novels, TV, and music. The phrase “widening gyre” alone has been an inexhaustible resource. In a 2009 Batman comic by that name, written by the film director Kevin Smith, the superhero's girlfriend nicknames him “Deedee,” in reference to their first night together (“we hit double digits”). Their bliss is cut short when the villain, Onomatopoeia, cuts the woman's throat open, and Batman wets his pants. Mere anarchy indeed.
Even without Dobbs, the 49ers, who run a 3-4 defense, still have six defensive linemen on their roster. They will also have another when nose tackle Glenn Dorsey is activated. Dorsey, who tore his biceps in training camp, is on injured reserve with the designation to return and resumed practicing last week. On Thursday, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said Dorsey is likely a “couple weeks” away from playing.
Among the 49ers' six current defensive linemen are two 2013 draft picks – Tank Carradine and Quinton Dial – who have received scant playing time this season. Dial has played 42 snaps in six games and Carradine has only been active for one game.

The state for years has spent money on urban school districts and federally mandated programs to help youngsters in need. Now, says Assemblyman Joe Cryan, the time has come for public colleges and universities that accept state funding to be more accountable for its graduation rates.

The bill clocks in at more than 1,600 pages, and Congress must pass it before Friday evening to avert a shutdown. It is likely to pass easily because it contains key boosts to defense and domestic programs viewed by leaders in both parties as vastly preferable to another stopgap measure. House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) said it is "the result of over a year's worth of careful and dedicated efforts to closely examine federal programs to make the best possible use of every tax dollar."
Would Smith have won the 1997 general election? Undoubtedly. His one-member-one-vote reform laid the union bogeyman to rest. Black Wednesday shredded the economic credibility of the Tories, who then started their 20-year (and counting) war on Europe.
If Google or any other tech company were secretly violating Net Neutrality, there would be an absolute and cataclysmic backlash from the grassroots and netroots who have made Net Neutrality a signature issue in 21st Century politics. The Internet community would come crashing down on their heads like Minutemen on Benedict Arnold.
It was tough for me to decipher any sort of grounded story in When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth due to the fact that the film's characters speak a “prehistoric” language that is nearly indecipherable beyond the emotion underneath it. Rather, when one is diving into this movie, one should expect more of a series of loosely connected events, moments of pure adrenaline and aggression that make for an exciting, if not shallow viewing experience – the perfect nonsense blockbuster that puts butts in seats. Over the course of 100 minutes, you will sit on the edge of your seat as the tribes of cavemen face off against giant dinosaurs in the night, giant dinosaurs that appear out of caves, and watch as the mythical giant creatures of legend appear to pit primitive man against the world in a thrilling battle to survive in most nightmarish landscape imaginable. You'll watch as man discovers the moon, and engages the opposite sex in the most primal of ways. It's equal parts special effects drive action, testosterone fueled madness of the most oddly appealing kind.
I had a hard time putting together a logical story during my screening of this film, but I'm not entirely sure director/screenwriter Val Guest set out to make a coherent feature like this in the first place. Rather him, and his Academy Award nominated special effects crew set out to create the forefather of today's action-adventure blockbusters, which exploit the most raw elements of our nature to make a thrill ride. To that effect, they mostly succeed thanks to the brilliant stop motion and practical visual effects implemented frequently throughout the film. They do an excellent job of creating convincing and exciting action sequences that feel fluid and natural, even if the creatures are, outside of a few sequences featuring actual lizards, models that are composited into the frame. Credit should also be given to the film's cast of cavemen and women, who do an excellent job of playing into the effects heavy action sequences of the film in a way that really helps sell the danger of each progressively more terrifying situation they land in.

Sessions at times would relate the contents of conversations with other high government officials (e.g., claiming he and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein agreed Comey should go) but refused to say whether he discussed Russia in conjunction with Comey's firing. Sessions is unlikely to get away with such gamesmanship with the special counsel.
This piece includes a very good chart of errors and misconceptions when applying the mass line. The major error that many people in the First World commit is the sectarian-dogmatist error, believing that they have all the answers, making lines and determining things among themselves, usually informed by reading old material that has no relation to the concrete conditions of the United States, not doing any SICA (Social Investigation and Class Analysis), and then carrying these lines to the masses. Spray-painting inaccessible slogans (VICTORY TO PEOPLE'S WAR IN PERU! FREE CHAIRMAN GONZALO!) in neighborhoods where people are worried about being deported or having their Social Security benefits or wages cut, pushing ancient lines that you read in Peking Review or A World To Win about arcane issues that maybe only 50 people in this country care about, going into black and brown communities or meeting black and brown people to tell them what they need, disrespecting their already established mass leaders, making lines among yourselves and then trying to argue with them on their internal community affairs, not developing mass contacts, and other things of this nature may work and get you pats on the back among your small group of comrades, but they hold no weight among the masses of people. First, you have never taken the initiative to reach out to and establish mass contacts in communities that you seek to begin work in. You mistake the small segment or fraction of “the masses” that is even slightly interested in your ideas or lines for the masses as a whole, and proffer your skimpy mass contact for actual, deep mass engagement and investigation. In “How to Fake the Mass Line“, this is discussed and laid out in detail:

I sure don't know. I'm still at the stage in my life that if I grow a mustache I just look a guy you'd see at the public library reading a big book about rare birds, muttering to himself little fragments of delighted incredulity at its contents.

A push of a button, and the paper target zings forward, jolting to a stop a foot from Schwarber. He peels off the tape and proudly displays the target to Paige Hartman, his girlfriend since high school.
Putting weight on the knee was out of the question, which meant he relied on his family and Hartman for everything from getting dressed to going to the bathroom. Hartman watched as her boyfriend fell deeper into a funk. “He didn't even want to bring sunlight in,” she recalls.
“So much fun,” adds Hartman. “All the wives and girlfriends and kids got to fly with the team that night.”

Fogle, 37, became the Subway restaurant chain's pitchman after shedding 245 pounds more than 15 years ago, in part by regularly eating Subway sandwiches. Subway began featuring Fogle in commercials soon after, and his story was instrumental in giving the sandwich chain an image as a healthy place to eat.
Jacob Schrader, 19, who lives across from Fogle's house, said the pitchman seems "like a pretty private guy" and that he'd only seen him about a dozen times in the last five or six years.

In a clear departure from his more socially conservative top-of-the-ticket running mate Mitt Romney, vice presidential candidate Congressman Paul Ryan, in an interview this afternoon on KRDO in Colorado Springs, when confronted with a question about whether or not he supported patients in Colorado having legal access to cannabis for medical purposes, Ryan said that although he personally opposes medical cannabis use he would defer to the judgment of each state to make up its own mind on the issue.
Dwight D. Eisenhower faced something of a dilemma in 1953. He was a military man to his socks and was inclined to augment defence in the face of the perceived 'reds under the bed' threat, but he was also a Republican US president and as such politically wedded to cutting state spending. His solution was simple - increase the armed forces but decrease their budget. In ordinary circumstances that circle would be difficult to square. The solution that the US Joint Chiefs of Staff came up with, which they titled the 'New Look', was a policy of using nuclear weapons in any conflict bigger than what they called 'a brush-fire war'. That allowed them to radically reduce the numbers of servicemen and replace them with the comparatively inexpensive atomic bombs.

Things should be taking a turn for the better for young Mr. Messer (Logan Lerman), but the realities of Winesburg prove just as challenging as his deflating home life. Assigned to a triple with two upperclassmen (Ben Rosenfeld and Philip Ettinger), the only other Jews living on campus not part of the Jewish fraternity, Marcus bristles as the expectation for all students to attend chapel services overseen by Dean Caudwell (Tracy Letts) in order to graduate. Beneath the surface of this sheltered boy beats the heart of a fierce intellectual, an atheist living in a time fearful of Godless Communists liberated by his newfound freedom away from home and unafraid to speak his mind inside the classroom and out. He is, however, still warring with the social repression instilled in him his whole life of valuing studies over all else, and when a brash and alluring young woman named Olivia (Sarah Gadon) catches his eye and shows an interest in him far exceeding the levels of decorum to which he is accustomed, his life is thrown into further turmoil. Marcus simply cannot find a foothold in the early 1950s.

“I appreciate you tackling a very, very dicey subject,” said Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, who also is running for governor. “We've had quite a debate in this chamber on anytime you're changing anything wholesale in elections, it makes people very uncomfortable.

That's just not going to cut it for a defenseman of his ilk who knows he can get six to seven years on the July 1 market at easily north of $5 million -- even with the Canadian dollar hammering the salary cap. Think Matt Niskanen this past offseason and his seven-year deal worth $5.75 million a year; there's no reason Franson can't be in the same range.
In the meantime, Toronto should get a nice return on a top-end right-handed rental defenseman before March 2, and they are assets this team needs to start piling up.

NEW YORK STATE — A plan to create a universal single-payer health insurance plan in New York state passed the Assembly on Tuesday, May 16, on the birthday of Health Committee Chairman Richard Gottfried (D-75), the bill's sponsor and the Assembly's most senior representative.
Assemblyman Angelo Santabarbara (D-111) voted against the bill, saying that, while he supports the idea of single-payer, he would feel more comfortable with a plan that was drafted with more knowledge of, and in direct response to, federal actions. He also said he wasn't convinced of its potential fiscal impacts.

Some Republicans have expressed reservations about money in the aid package that did not go directly to relief efforts and questioned why the bill needed to be passed quickly when Congress was also dealing with the "fiscal cliff" and other issues. It seemed on Tuesday that Congressmen from the Northeast and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had hammered out a deal to split the aid bill up into two parts, but then Boehner unexpectedly declined to bring it up for a vote.

The Act for the Advancement of True Religion, which was passed by parliament on 12 May 1543 made it illegal for women below the rank of noblewoman or gentlewoman to read the Bible in English, while those upper class women still permitted to continue, were required to read only in private. Great swathes of Englishwomen were suddenly criminalised; but many kept on reading either at home or in public.
Joan was fortunate and spent the rest of Henry VIII's reign in obscurity. Anne Askew, a woman with whom Joan shared her ‘nearest friendship' was less fortunate. This Lincolnshire gentlewoman was thrown out of her home by her husband after (as she claimed) ‘she ‘fell clearly from all old superstition of papistry, to a perfect belief in Jesus Christ'. Anne, as a gentlewoman, was legally permitted to read the Bible in English at home, but she provoked outrage when she was found reading the scriptures in Lincoln Cathedral soon afterwards, being surrounded by ‘three score priests'. Determined, as she said, ‘that all men knew my conversation and living in all points', she resolved to go to London.

Another new film this month is Netflix's Nappily Ever After (NEA). Based on the novel by Trisha R. Thomas, Nappily Ever After is a romantic comedy about a woman who leaves her live-in boyfriend after he just won't commit. The usual independence and self-discovery follow. The film stars Sanna Lathan, Ernie Hudson, and Ricky Whittle (who you might recognize as Shadow Moon from Starz's American Gods.) The movie started production at the tail end of August, shooting on Deering Road, near Amtrak's Peachtree Station. The next day, a basecamp was spotted at Peachtree Presbyterian Church on Roswell Road. Signs were spotted between August 30 and 31 at North Avenue and Piedmont Road, leading to a basecamp in northern Midtown. On September 7, crews worked out of the Porsche Experience Center. On the 14th, filming took place in East Point. Most recently, on September 20, a basecamp was set up at 11th and Juniper Streets in Midtown.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said levies imposed by Obamacare, including taxes on medical devices and benefit-rich health insurance polices known as “Cadillac” plans, could be tackled through tax reform or a revised healthcare bill.
The prospects for using tax reform to repeal Obamacare's taxes dimmed earlier this week in the House of Representatives, when House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he would not include the Obamacare items in tax reform legislation his panel is expected to disclose later this year.

Since Bryan LaHair headed off to Japan (he's since become available again, by the way), and since the Cubs hitched their first base star to Anthony Rizzo, there hasn't been much in the way of an obvious AAA first baseman in the organization. When you've got a full-time first baseman on the big league roster (particularly in the NL), AAA 1B is a nice place to stash one of those older, questionable prospects who've always hit in the minors but may never have a position in the big leagues. The Cubs did that when they picked up LaHair, they'd done it before with Micah Hoffpauir, and they did it last year with Brad Nelson.
The rub with Anderson, however, unlike some of the AAA first basemen who've come before him, is that Anderson has not raked in recent years. Although he tore through the lower minors in such impressive fashion that he was a top 100 prospect in baseball (at first base, no less) from 2008 to 2010 (and actually reached the bigs as a 22-year-old in 2010). From there, however, his production trailed off at AAA, and he's hit just .250/.347/.391 over 1775 AAA plate appearances. In that time, he's struck out at a greater than 25% clip, which you don't love to see, but his walk rate has been through the roof (some 13.5% the last three years).
Vulture: When I was about 16 years old, after punk shows we would go out to a diner or something like that, and I wouldn't order food because I knew there would be leftovers. I'd pick at everyone else's food or pick food off of another table. My philosophy was: I had money, I had a job, but the less money I spent on food, I could buy more punk rock t-shirts and see more punk rock shows. Then one night my friend's girlfriend was like, "This guy is like a fucking vulture. He's eating off every table in here."
A Minnesota motorist is a case in point. The gentleman was driving on I-35W near County Road E2, just after 5:15 p.m. July 2 when his vehicle stalled out, blocking a lane of traffic on the interstate.

[T]he national debt at the time was under $8 trillion and was $8.67 trillion when Nancy Pelosi became Speaker, Today the debt stands at $14.625, meaning that while Democrats controlled the purse string, the national debt literally exploded. We are living in different times. Majority Leader Cantor, Whip [Kevin] McCarthy and Chairman [Paul] Ryan wrote an entire book last year about how the previous Republican majority lost its way, particularly on spending issues. That was one of the major reasons the Republican majority became the Republican minority from 2006-2010. House Republicans then ran, and won, an election pledging to be responsible stewards of federal tax dollars.

Now let"s go back in time to an afternoon in the late summer of 1984. I am sitting in one of many legal/litigation meetings at Author Services, Inc., or ASI. I am in RTC, a nonprofit religious corporation which ostensibly has absolutely nothing to do wth ASI, a for-profit corporation. But David Miscavige finds it convenient at the moment to be the Chairman of the Board of ASI, and, since David Miscavige runs Scientology (no matter where he places himself corporately), he can order all of us to meet wherever and whenever he wants us to.
When asked earlier this season how he would describe the current trend in modern defenses, New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton summed it up in one word: “confusion.” While there are few truly “new” ideas in football, there is a near infinite number of ways to hide, disguise, or slightly vary those ideas. One increasingly popular idea in the NFL is the “psycho front“, which simply refers to a defense that has two, one or maybe even zero defensive linemen with their hands on the ground and tends to stack the line of scrimmage. This may mean the defense is bringing a heavy blitz — or it might not. Often, the defense will show this look and then back out of it into some kind of coverage.
Of course, the psycho itself is just a spin on some scheme done before; the fact that a defensive lineman takes his hand off the ground doesn't, by itself, change the defensive structure. Indeed, these same issues have been presented by NFL-style heavy blitz teams in the past. The problem presented in the image below is the same one as in the image above, as the defense shows a seven-man defensive front while the offense has only the five linemen and one running back as pass protectors. If the offense uses some spreads run game they can tilt the numbers slightly back to their favor, but it's still a big issue.
The best equipment is indeed born from the strongest steel, but the real secret is everything else. It's the intricacy of the knurling. The fine finish and spin of the collars. The incredible precision, balance, and fit between every single component. And most importantly, it's the craftsman taking ultimate pride in the manufactured result.
Full members of the Compass Point All Stars, Weymouth and Frantz formed the Tom Tom Club in 1980, which kept them busy during a fairly long hiatus in Talking Heads activity. When it became obvious that Talking Heads frontman David Byrne had no interest in another Talking Heads album, Weymouth, Frantz, and Jerry Harrison reunited without him for a single album called No Talking, Just Head under the name "The Heads" in 1996, featuring a rotating cast of vocalists. Weymouth has been critical of Byrne, describing him as "a man incapable of returning friendship."[8]
“One of the other patients had a butch girlfriend and the minute I saw her, I knew – I could carve out a life that way,” he says.
The video was posted on Facebook, and right at the beginning the group formulates their aspirations: “We are coming and will take the whole country,” says the voice-over, while pictures alternate between wild hordes of horsemen in the desert and the posing rockers. “Men, who will stand their ground in the battlefield to the last drop of their blood,” the voice tells us.
Istiqlal Mosque has one Grand Imam, one Deputy Grand Imam, and seven imams. As of 2016 the Grand Imam is former Deputy Minister for Religious Affairs (2011–2014), Nasaruddin Umar and the Chairman of Istiqlal Mosque is the former Indonesian Ambassador to Syria (2006–2010), Muhammad Muzammil Basyuni.[28] Previous Grand Imams include Zaini Miftah (1970–1980), Mukhtar Nasir (1980–2004), Nasrullah Djamaluddin (2004–2005) and Ali Mustafa Yaqub (2005–2015). The current Deputy Grand Imam is Al Hajj Syarifuddin Muhammad, former chairman of the Indonesian Hafiz Association.
I'm sure there will be an appeal, but this is quite a victory for photographers and the judgment is fascinating reading for fair use buffs (download it here), What I really found interesting is how badly most people (myself included) interpret the transformation part of appropriating works. Everyone talks about adding value through transformation but the reality is that you must be commenting on the original image or expression in some way. This line quoted from Rogers vs. Koons puts the nail in the idea of adding value as some kind of transformation “If an infringement of copyrightable expression could be justified as fair use solely on the basis of the infringer's claim to a higher or different artistic use . . . there would be no practicable boundary to the fair use defense.” Transforming a picture of President Obama into a poster does not qualify nor does comment on commercial advertising by taking close up shots of cowboys in cigarette advertising images.
Kerstine Appunn and her boyfriend took three and a half months to land a spacious two-bedroomed flat in Prenzlauer Berg, one of Berlin's pricier inner-city districts, where organic cafes populate the pretty, tree-lined streets.
This stems from a lack of entertainment for students. For students to be entertained, they must go to somewhat extreme, and expensive, lengths. One story that was shared with me involved a group of freshmen walking for over an hour along Route 18 to the East Bridgewater movie theater. For those looking for music or theater, they must drive, or take the train, to Boston or Providence. Neither option is cheap, and neither option keeps them in Bridgewater. Therefore, Friday nights for Bridgewater students consist of food shopping and late-night burger runs. This is not appealing to the locals, let alone to incoming freshmen. Perhaps this is why more than half of Bridgewater�s students commute, like I did, and locals go elsewhere for a night out.
Which United States national team player has swapped kits with Zlatan, James, and Falcao in the past year? Eight by Eight's Andrew Helms sat down with Alejandro Bedoya in Boston last week and talked about his impressive European career, the future of the U.S. team, and how to lead over 38,000 Frenchmen in song. Does he have your attention now?
The intent-to-initiate-litigation letter states the NFL is also listed as a potential defendant because the league has "not officially disciplined nor taken steps to eliminate the systemic discriminatory practices by the Miami Dolphins, LTD." The letter cites the "ignorant and inappropriate homosexual comments" directed at former Dolphins offensive lineman Jonathan Martin as part of the Richie Incognito bullying scandal as well as recent homophobic tweets by Miami defensive back Don Jones about St. Louis Rams defensive end Michael Sam.
Spokesmen for the Dolphins and NFL both declined comment on the letter to FOX Sports 1.
As detailed on his Green Books, Gaddafi's official ideas helped develop Libya from a state which in its pre-revolutionary days had virtually no modern infrastructure, little modern housing, no real modern irrigation or sewage systems, low levels of literacy and a very low life expectancy, to one which attained the highest living standards in Africa history, where housing was either cheap or free, education and healthcare were free, petrol and car ownership was subsidised by the state, food was cheap and plentiful and where a highly elaborate man-made river made the desert bloom.
Reyes said her nightmare began in May when a teacher at Gimnasio Castillo Campestre school in the Colombian capital Bogotá, saw a photo of Sergio kissing his boyfriend of a month and a half on his cellphone. After confiscating the phone, both boys were sent to the school psychologist.
The boyfriend was then forced by the school to tell his parents about his sexuality and was quickly withdrawn from the school.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) had asked the OGE for guidance on how to respond to Conway's remarks, which he described as “over the line” and “unacceptable.” It is unclear if he will disagree with the content of the letter.

Twenty-eight-year-old Shah debuted in first-class cricket at 16. Nine years later he played his first international, an ODI against Zimbabwe. Three and a half years after that, he was picked in Pakistan's World Cup squad, before he had turned out a second time in 50-overs cricket. His ability to outsmart international batsmen cannot be questioned, given his 12 wickets at 17.25 against Australia in the UAE in late 2014. Pakistan will be hoping for more of the same, especially given Saeed Ajmal and Mohammad Hafeez's bowling suspensions.
A MAN convicted of driving while using a mobile phone claimed he did not own a phone at all as part of his defence. However, halfway during his hearing at Bega Local Court a phone began to ring in his pocket – much to the surprise of the courtroom. On July 29, 23-year-old Matt Thomas Macadam of Queanbeyan East was found guilty of driving while using a phone and fined $1000. About 4.45pm on March 11 he was driving a blue Ford Falcon along Carp St, Bega, accompanied by his girlfriend in the front passenger seat as well as two males and a child in the back. When Constable Glenn Raymond of Bega Police stopped his car at the Auckland/Carp St traffic lights he said he looked into Macadam's car and saw the driver of the vehicle using a phone with his left hand, either sending a text or changing music on the device. Macadam was stopped and served a court notice, but pleaded not guilty and represented himself at the Bega Courthouse. While he claimed the phone belonged to his girlfriend, in his sentencing Magistrate Daryl Pearce said it did not matter who owned the phone, just if the driver was using it when at the wheel. The magistrate said at one stage he was of the view the phone was being used by Macadam's girlfriend and the police officer had mixed up their hands. However, he said that was not the defence of the accused, who claimed his girlfriend had the phone between her legs. “I find that rather unusual, to have your phone between your legs when you want to change the music,” Magistrate Pearce said. He said driving while using a phone was a “prevalent offence”.

The ethnic girlfriend.Yes, you've got the look down but, as we ALL know, nothing's complete without accessories. You without a ethnic girlfriend is like a messenger bag without thousands of buttons proclaiming your political leanings and your extensive knowledge of music.Well luckily for you, here I am. Your very own, personal, cute, non-threatening, little Asian. What better way to piss off your wealthy blue-blood Greenwich-Hamptons family, without pushing the line, than to date a shy, quiet, non-threatening Asian chick? Yellow's close enough to white, anyway. After all, you wouldn't want your parents to cut you off from your monthly allowance - you might have to get a job and give up your dreams of being a rock star. Anyway, you majored in English and Music at NYU, and teaching's not really your thing.Also, you really need somebody to drape your arm around after your show, to hand you a beer as soon as you come off stage and to tell you just how good you were. You were SO good. Yes, someone who will complement your style without overshadowing you. Want to coordinate outfits? I've got a vintage crocheted minidress that would look so good with your tweed jacket.I can be anything you want, baby. Want me to wear only black and white, sneer and blow smoke into people's eyes? I can do that. Want me to dress like I smoked a bowl of ice and then hitched a ride with Marty McFly in the Delorean? I got you covered. Want me to impress your snotty friends with my extensive vocabulary and vast knowledge of International Relations? I'll read-up on my current events just for you, even though I hide copies of Star magazine in my copy of the Voice. After all, I did go to an elite boarding school and then art-school, where I majored in graphic design.If I hadn't, would I be the well-dressed, cooler-than-thou hipster I am today?Also, I'm stick-thin, fashionably bisexual and smoke bidis. I am publicly a socialist but am secretly a rampant materialist. Do you think I actually go to Sal-Val for these ironic shirts? Please. I shop exclusively at Andy's Cheepee's, Cheapjack's and Screaming Mimi's. So what if I have to pay the finder's fee? It's not like I don't have a trust-fund, anyway. I just wait tables at the vegan restaurant to look like I'm slumming it. I don't actually need the money.So. You need to have me hanging like a wristband off your lanky arm and you know it. Please, bassists and drummers only - and send a picture. I only pretend I'm not shallow.this is in or around Probably the L train
At home in Toronto, resting after another second-round playoff exit by the Capitals, Ward understood his time in Washington had ended. He and his agent wanted a four-year deal, one final haul before one- and two-year offers ushered Ward into the twilight of his career; the Capitals wouldn't budge from a short-term offer. Ward spent the late June days fretting over the uncertainty until his girlfriend reminded him to relax. If you sit around and think all day, she told him, “then you're just pulling hair out of your head.”
Still, there remain a few sanctums of civility where affable and civil people are attempting to do good work apart from the harmful quibbling. With its acquisition of Skry (previously known as Coinalytics) in February, Bloq has gained a mighty tool capable of AI and machine learning to analyze blockchain data and efficiency. “Blockchain networks will create the greatest data sets we've ever seen,” said Matthew Roszak, Chairman and Co-founder of Bloq.
From 1975 to 1980, the Steelers' four Super Bowl championship teams abounded in players whom Nunn had found in black colleges: the defensive backs Mel Blount, from Southern, and Donnie Shell, from South Carolina State; the receivers John Stallworth, from Alabama A. & M., and Frank Lewis, from Grambling; and the defensive linemen L. C. Greenwood, from Arkansas A. M. & N., and Ernie Holmes, from Texas Southern.
McCarthy's notice came hours after two potential rivals took themselves out of the running. Both Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (Tex.), a prominent conservative who has clashed with Boehner, and Rep. Peter J. Roskam (Ill.), a former chief deputy whip who has taken a leading role in calling for party harmony, announced that they would not seek the speaker's post.
Those moves followed decisions last week by a pair of conservatives — Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Wis.) and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (Ohio) — that they, too, would not run for the speakership.
The jockeying for that No. 2 post in the House intensified Monday as Ryan and Hensarling both endorsed Rep. Tom Price (Ga.), the conservative Budget Committee chairman, to be the next majority leader — passing Majority Whip Steve Scalise (La.). Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), who had been considering a run, decided Monday to bypass the race.
There is plenty of brinkmanship to be had yet before any final decision is made but Alves' personality may yet play a big part.
“I'm just taking what they're giving me, reading the offensive linemen and just taking advantage of whatever their sets are,” Bates said. “Our coaches have been doing a really nice job of giving us tools to use in the game with hand skills and get-off and stuff like that. Just taking advantage of everything they're giving me. …
Despite the potential threat, Rubio has continued to speak out against Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, has pushed for more sanctions and even engaged in a brief Twitter exchange with Cabello Rondon last week when the senator accused the Venezuelan official of involvement in drug trafficking, which Cabello Rondon has denied.
"I apologize to everyone who was offended by my insensitive tweet about the situation in Egypt. I've dedicated my life to raising awareness about serious social issues, and in hindsight my attempt at humor regarding a nation liberating themselves against oppression was poorly timed and absolutely inappropriate," said Kenneth Cole, Chairman & Chief Creative Officer.
Because of his 18-game trial with the Pens last year, Despres is the odd-on favorite among Pittsburgh defensive prospects to make his mark in the coming season. The 6-foot-2 defenseman averaged better than a point-per-game in his final three QMJHL campaigns. With Wilkes-Barre, he scored only five goals and 15 points in 45 games during his first professional season, although he didn't look out of place on the Penguins' blue line, contributing with surprisingly solid defense and four points (1G, 3A). There's talk that he could see time with Kris Letang. If that happens then there's a chance that Despres could surprise to the upside right off the bat.
Despres tops the list of Pens' prospects ready to make the jump to CONSOL Energy Center at some point in 2011-12. The team boasts seven competent defenders ahead of him, but rarely does a defensive corps stay healthy throughout the course of a season. For his part, Despres helped the St. John Sea Dogs to a Memorial Cup victory in the QMJHL. The 20-year-old blueliner netted 13 goals and picked up 41 points in 47 contests. Despres has increased his goals totals in each of his four junior seasons, posting marks of 1, 2, 9, and 13, respectively. He has good size at 6-foot-4, 225 pounds, but isn't known as a physical player. From a fantasy perspective, defensemen typically take a couple years to make their presence felt. Moreover, Despres has yet to even see any time in the AHL. Still, the blueliner from Laval deserves consideration in keeper leagues and an early arrival in Pittsburgh could offer surprising results.
Pittsburgh's 2009 No. 1 pick, Despres made great strides in the QMJHL last season. Despres potted more goals (9) and more points (67) than he did in his previous two years, combined. The defenseman netted three goals and 43 points during his first two QMJHL campaigns. It's possible that Despres starts his professional career with the Baby Pens in the fall or even spends nine games with Pittsburgh at the start of the NHL season. Even so, he's probably a year or two away from making an impact at Consol Energy Center.
Despres will head back to his junior team in 2009-10. For a No. 1 pick, it's pretty amazing that the defenseman has just three goals in 130 QMJHL contests. It's unlikely he makes the Pens for at least a couple of seasons. He has the potential to serve as an assist distributer, but there's really no reason to pick him up, even in most keeper leagues.
Bobby Drake has been in the superhero game longer than most. But while reflecting on what he's accomplished over the years, he realizes that the legacy he's built is a few good one-liners and a string of failed relationships. Not only that, but now a younger version of himself has emerged from the timestream and he's more put together than Bobby ever was: already a world-class hero in his own right, but also totally comfortable in his own skin, complete with a relationship with a handsome Inhuman to boot. In this new ongoing series penned by Sina Grace (Burn the Orphanage, Self-Obsessed) and drawn by Alessandro Vitti (SECRET WARRIORS), Bobby realizes that the time is never or now, and sets out to build a life and legacy he can be proud of…and be the best ICEMAN he can be!
Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes issued a statement Tuesday calling Trump's most recent attacks on Kelly "bullying" and said it is "as unacceptable as it is disturbing."
But England has been cycling through spinners like a channel-hopping teenager trying to stave off boredom. The progress that Ali has made since his Test debut in 2014 is remarkable, especially for a man who was more of a batsman who bowled. What he has shown in the Test series in Bangladesh endorses what captain Alastair Cook made clear when speaking about him this summer.
Just like Ali, Ansari is a batsman trying to become a spinner rather than an out-and-out specialist bowler. He has been selected with hope rather than expectation.
Blackamoor: 18th century art and jewellery linked to 'racial conquest' Blackamoor art in Shirley Bassey's bedroom Blackamoor jewellery and art was extremely popular in the 18th Century. But they are now considered to be highly racially insensitive and the word blackamoor has been condemned as a term of abuse for anyone with a dark skin. In recent years there have been petitions for galleries and hotels to remove them, Blackamoors first emerged during the Middle Ages when Europeans first encountered the Moors, dark-skinned Muslims from North Africa and the Middle East who came to occupy various parts of the continent. The African figure is typically depicted with a turban, dressed in lavish jewels and are commonly fixed in positions of servitude—such as footmen or waiters. They are usually carved from ebony or painted black in the case of porcelain. While they became an art form in the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly in Italy, many believe the figures suggest ‘racial conquest'.
The latest attempt was spearheaded by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry (D-Mass.), who scheduled a series of hearings on the issue over the past three months. And on Monday, a Kerry spokeswoman signaled the senator still plans to push for ratification – but not until after the Nov. 3 elections.
Clinton's aides initially attempted to connect with the outspoken businessman roughly a month ago, he says, simply for a general conversation. But the Clinton campaign also apparently reached out to Cuban on Sunday, two days after a widely circulated online Meet the Press clip posted showing the billionaire with a boyish haircut saying that he'd be willing to consider the vice-presidential slot on her ticket.

Now, Wonder Woman is bad throughout most of her ?classic? period, which gives modern writers precious little to draw upon when trying to make her modern comics interesting. It?s not a case of her Silver Age being degenerate from more promising Golden Age adventures, either. If you go back to the original Wonder Woman comics done by her original creators? Jesus Christ. A Golden Age Superman or Batman story may be crude, but there?s still something fundamentally recognizable about it. You can imagine how the characters got from that old Point A to their shiny, modern Point B.

But if an award for the league's best defenseman isn't enough to convince Therrien he's got something special on his hands in Subban, what will?
Two days after Chris Pennington's song "Why not P.K.?" (imploring Michel Therrien to use his star defenseman more often) made its debut on TSN 690, Subban played 28:22. The power (tower) of song. Subban led all skaters with 8 shots on goal, most of them on the power play. Seemed ready to carry the offense - if only he could. His agent Don Meehan was in the building as discussions on a new contract have begun with GM Marc Bergevin. Imagine the Habs without Subban? One can only hope Bergevin feels as you do and tries as hard as he can to lock up Subban instead of sending him to, say, Edmonton.
"There's no shame in enjoying a quiet life. And that's been the realization of the past few years for me," he says. "As much as I would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time, that doesn't work for me. I'd just rather sit at home and read, or go out to dinner with someone, or talk to someone I love, or talk to somebody that makes me laugh. And the "Deathly Hallows" star tells the magazine that he now has the company of that special someone. "I'm actually enjoying the fact that I can have a relationship with my girlfriend [Olive Uniacke], where I'm really pleasant and not f---ed up totally all the time."
If the Church represents a long history of torment and women's oppression, it is only because of some (likely well-intentioned) misremembering. From the apostle Paul's associate Thecla to Margaret Fell Fox to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, an impressive number of Christian women have championed women's rights both within and outside the Church. Even if we dismiss those women as anomalies, we return to the question of whose ideology they were really combating. And, though they certainly had fine reasons to oppose anti-woman doctrine and dogma within the Church, those principles did not necessarily arise from a uniquely Christian attitude.
None of this is to say that the anti-woman attitudes espoused in Paul's letters have not heavily influenced Christianity and by way of doing so, much of Western culture. But it is important for the cause of women's rights to acknowledge that Christianity is not the origin of all anti-woman oppression. Turning away from Christianity — or any religion, therefore — is not a panacea for the maltreatment of women. The seeds of misogyny were planted in the literatures that gave rise to the discourse of the earliest Christians; the tendency of new atheists to adopt similar exclusionary tactics with regard to woman thinkers isn't, therefore, necessarily evidence of secular thinkers acting too religiously. They may well simply be responding to elements of our culture that run deeper than religious doctrine.
Now that Kelly is gone, the only linemen with any experience at tackle are Allen Barbre and Matt Tobin, both of whom are natural guards. If Johnson's suspension holds up, or veteran left tackle Jason Peters is lost to injury, the Eagles will have an obvious weakness at tackle - which is terrible news for Sam Bradford.

Prof Andre Lankov of Kookmin University in South Korea reckons that nearly 500 South Koreans have been abducted. "The vast majority of them are fishermen who were imprudent to come too close to the North Korean coast but this figure also includes a number of known victims of covert operations," he says.
Mahmoud al-Kumi and Hussam Salama worked as cameramen for Al-Aqsa TV, which is run by Hamas and whose reporting frequently reflects that affiliation. They were covering events in central Gaza when a missile struck their car, which, according to Al-Aqsa, was clearly marked with the letters “TV.” (The car just in front of them was carrying a translator and driver for The New York Times, so the execution hit close to our organization.) And Mohamed Abu Aisha, director of the private Al-Quds Educational Radio, was also in a car when it was hit by a missile.
However, the "unapologetic pro-life Republican"'s chief argument is that conservatives have been routinely hammered on the issue by Democrats who use it to paint them as anti-women zealots. (To be fair to liberals, you only have to look at the right's reaction to Sandra Fluke this summer to see that it wasn't that hard.) By removing the prescription requirement, and by extension, government oversight of contraceptive drugs, you take away a political fight that Republicans are increasingly losing.
What's clear is that Senator McConnell's and Congressman Boehner's plan would do absolutely nothing to grow our economy, put people back to work and strengthen America's middle class. Instead, it would take us back to the same exact failed economic policies that created the mess we're in: cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires; cut rules for the special interests and big corporations and cut the middle class loose to fend for itself.
I've been looking into what most of the Republican congressional candidates have in common this year-- no it isn't O'Donnell's anti-masturbation mania-- and it seems to be a threat to block tax cuts for the middle class if the wealthiest 2 or 3% of Americans don't get them too. Their message is, "If the rich don't get their Bush tax breaks extended, no one else will either." Crooked Ohio used car dealer Tom Ganley is a good example . He's trying to buy a seat for himself in northeast Ohio (suburbs of Cleveland and Akron) and he isn't terribly savvy, just sort of parroting the Boehner line. His opponent, progressive Congresswoman Betty Sutton has been an indefatigable fighter for the middle class and is a champion of extending the tax breaks for middle class families. Ganley is more interested in the 3% of Americans who have benefited the most from the Bush economy: " The President just doesn't seem to understand how dire a situation his policies have created. AND he's now arguing a step that I believe will certainly make the problem far worse! He's proposing the elimination of Bush tax cuts for families earning more than $250,000 a year-- in other words, a TAX INCREASE for all those folk. He says he would use that revenue to fund a temporary tax credit for business investment."A bit to the south of Sutton's district, Congressman John Yarmuth, who represents the Louisville area and is also a firm backer of an extension of middle-class tax cuts and new incentives for small business, is up against Todd Lally, a guy widely seen as dangerously uninformed and angry to the point of becoming unhinged. And Lally, like Ganley, seems obsessed with helping "hard-pressed" millionaires.Ganley and Lally may be stupider than your average garden variety GOP House candidates, but, essentially, it's the same message wherever you look. When asked directly by the Louisvilleif he thought wealthy people were really the ones hurting, he replied, “Yes, I think some of them are.” Economists have concluded that, in fact, the wealth of American millionaires increased by 16% in 2009 alone, while the income of middle-class workers remained stagnate or declined. According to the CBO, extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy will cost taxpayers $700 billion over ten years. When confronted with the burden this would place on the national debt, Lally scoffed, reiterated strong support for his millionaire tax plan and offered no plan to pay for it.Now, recall thatback on September 12, Boehner, probably drunk, said onthat he would vote to extend middle-class tax rates even if it means eliminating the reductions on household incomes exceeding $250,000 a year. He's been walking that back -- in a panic-- ever since. Fearful of the scorn of more Republicans Boehner put together a press conference and said, repeatedly, that he would support only legislation that kept in place the tax cuts for the wealthy as well as for average Americans.As Dan Pfeiffer explained on the White House blog yesterday, the Republican approach to the scheduled sunsetting on the Bush tax cuts will double the nation's deficit over the next decade Tuesday three of the most committed progressives in Congress, Alan Grayson, Raul Grijalva and Mary Jo Kilroy sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi urging action on the Bush tax cuts before October adjournment. The letter calls for the elimination of tax cuts for the top 2% of Americans who simply don't need them, and use that revenue to help end deficit spending. Boehner and his cronies are already going insane over it-- especially since it was their decades of pushing terrible trade policies that led to the terrible US-China trade deficit and this elimination of unwarranted tax cuts to the wealthy is being touted as a way to get rid of that deficit.Meanwhile you might be interested in a survey from Stan Greenberg's Democracy Corps that shows how strongly voters support the Democratic position on letting the tax breaks to the wealthy expiry while extending them for the middle class.President Obama spoke about the hostage-taking from the Rose Garden late yesterday afternoon:Senator David Vitter doesn't pay any attention when President Obama speaks. He summed up the Republican incomprehension of the plight of regular American families nicely and it was caught on tape by Charlie Melancon's campaign. Now Melancon is a conservative Blue Dog, but eventhinks unfair tax breaks for millionaires should be allowed to expire while tax cuts for the middle class stay in place:
David Wallechinsky, an American member of the I.O.C.'s cultural and heritage commission and the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, said the election of Mr. Trump in November had hurt Los Angeles's bid with I.O.C. delegates because Mr. Trump was perceived as being “anti-Muslim, anti-woman and anti-Latino.” “This is worse,” Mr. Wallechinsky said of the Muslim ban, adding, “I would consider it a blow to the Los Angeles bid — not fatal but a blow.” At a meeting at the I.O.C.'s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, several days after the American presidential election, Mr. Wallechinsky was asked repeatedly, “What is wrong with your country?” he said.

The survey was meant to study how and if the media is meeting the public's “critical information needs” on subjects like public health, politics, transportation and the environment. Now, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said questions about news philosophy and editorial judgment will be removed from the survey and media owners and reporters will no longer be questioned.
Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Friday in the House of Commons that anyone who has their NEXUS membership revoked can appeal to an ombudsman in Canada.
Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa followed up on this exchange to clarify the point.
Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa noted at the beginning of the hearing that Accountability Review Board co-chairman Pickering and Mullen refused to testify to the committee or even informally talk to it.
“On February 22nd, this committee wrote to Ambassador Pickering and Admiral Mullen, who, as required by law, were appointed by Secretary Clinton and co-chair the accountability review board investigation,” said Chairman Issa. “We asked them to testify about their investigation and findings. They refused, and our minority said nothing.
ISPs were heartened by Pai's nomination. "During his tenure on the Commission, Chairman Pai has consistently demonstrated a common-sense philosophy that consumers are best served by a robust marketplace that encourages investment, innovation and competition," said Michael Powell, president & CEO of NCTA – The Internet & Television Association, an industry trade group, in a statement.
Pai "is highly qualified to lead," said David Cohen, Comcast's senior executive vice president and chief diversity officer, in a statement. "This is a terrific appointment for the American consumer and the companies the FCC regulates and we look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Pai in his new role.”
Pai could rethink his promise to undo Net neutrality rules, said Gene Kimmelman, president and CEO of public interest group Public Knowledge. "Every Commissioner who has been elevated to Chairman discovers the job is very different from what he or she thought it would be," he said in a statement.
"Most quickly discover that getting things done while running an agency sometimes requires a different set of skills as well as a willingness to compromise," Kimmelman said. "With this in mind, we urge Chairman Pai to preserve consumer protections and to focus on driving down prices and expanding choices for all essential communications services while preserving the Commission's recent pro-competitive and consumer protection rules and actions.”

Oregon and Arizona shared the regular season title. Both cause major headaches for opponents. The Ducks rank second nationally in total blocks (212) and blocked shots per game (6.84). They also feature an electric playmaker in Dillon Brooks. The Wildcats weathered early injuries and suspensions to earn a third league title in four seasons. Freshman center Lauri Markkanen exceeded all expectations, averaging 15.2 points and 7.5 rebounds per game in the regular season. Markkanen draws tons of defensive attention away from Alonzo Trier, allowing him to pick defenses apart. Trier averaged a team-best 16.4 points per game heading into the postseason.
Franken has drawn on the same technique to state his opposition to the nomination of Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras to the Eighth Circuit. In the statement that he released after his pretended four-month study of Justice Stras's record, Franken announced that he would withhold his blue slip and therefore prevent Justice Stras's nomination even from consideration by the Senate unless it is dishonored by Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley. Here are the two operative paragraphs of Franken's statement (with my editorial notation of falsehoods):
It wasn't pretty for Canadiens defenceman Jordie Benn, either. In the first period, just 26 seconds after Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin scored his first of four goals to bring his season total to seven, Benn made a blind breakout pass to Brendan Gallagher that landed on Andre Burakovsky's stick and ultimately ended up behind Carey Price.
Benn started on a pair with Shea Weber, was moved to the left of Jeff Petry in the second period, and was turn-styled on three separate occasions before night's end. Ironically, he was one of two defencemen on the Canadiens' side to not get scored on more than once in the game.
And even if Streit's skating stride limits his ability to have the same impact on games he's had for the majority of his career, he is capable of making much better decisions, of executing with more precision, and of playing as a sixth defenceman on occasion.
The formation of the Institute is the latest rollout in the rapid expansion of Paul's libertarian cottage industry in the wake of his 2012 retirement. Earlier this week, Paul launched his own home school curriculum course, which promises an "education in liberty like no other," and vows never to seek government accreditation. The former Texas Congressman has also hit the speaking circuit, charging $50,000 per appearance.
“I'm glad I got to serve with a statesman like Clyde Graeber.”
“In the heat and emotion of the debate, I exclaimed the phrase ‘it's a baby killer' in reference to the agreement reached by the Democratic leadership,” Mr. Neugebauer said. “While I remain heartbroken over the passage of this bill and the tragic consequences it will have for the unborn, I deeply regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct reference to Congressman Stupak himself.”
Doughty, on younger defensemen assuming more responsibility:
The race also includes New Hampshire Democratic Chairman Raymond Buckley; South Carolina Democratic Chairman Jaime Harrison; Sally Boynton Brown, executive director of the Idaho Democratic Party; Peter Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind.; and former Fox News commentator Jehmu Greene.
Body shape, fashion and dieting have always been close bedfellows. The move from the padded hour-glass Victorian figure to the barber-pole Flapper was one of the most extreme changes in trend, and this fashion led doctors to begin worrying that dieting might be dangerous. The press went into a frenzy. Women with boyish figures could turn into lesbians, they screamed, even as they sold advertising space for diet products. All manner of quacks were making themselves a tidy income out of those who could pinch an inch. Sylvia of Hollywood massaged the likes of Jean Harlow and Gloria Swanson, their fat oozing through the pores "like mashed potato through a colander", and she was rumoured to have caused the first Hollywood-induced death-by-diet. Dr Lulu Hunt Peters, 15st 10lb at her heaviest and the best-selling author of calorie-counting diet books, castigated her readers, telling them it was an absolute disgrace to be big.
The road to the foot of Bromo take up to 30 minutes. You can rent a horse to move faster ($ 6-10). Don't worry if you have never ridden a horse. Usually tourist don't ride, they just sit on a horse, and a horseman lead it. But when I had seen this huge field around, I dreamt about gallop riding when there is nobody around .
All the issues he failed to address in previous years have now become obstacles. He believed for too long that the country, reforms and the economic recovery would essentially happen automatically. But he was wrong. About 4 million Frenchmen are now out of work, although the unemployment figure declined slightly in September, for the first time in years. The economy is reeling instead of growing, as it alternates between shrinking and stagnating. Factories are closing every day, and there is growing resentment among workers.
He can be portrayed as a statesman in a documentary filmed in his palace, and he can order his army to bomb Islamic State militants in Syria. But even his foreign policy, in which he seems much more decisive than on domestic issues, has done nothing to improve his poor approval ratings.
We all knew it was possible; rumours have had the Oilers moving one of their good young forwards in exactly this sort of deal for years now. But Hall was their trump card, the one arrow in their quiver that they could reach for if they had a shot at the sort of Norris-calibre defenceman that could transform the team. Instead, they used him to get Adam Larsson, who is… well, not that guy.
Did that sound convincing? I'm not sure it sounded convincing. Just remember: The Oilers were always going to have to settle for guy like Larsson because Norris-winning defencemen in their prime never get traded in this league. OK, what's next?
At the risk of opening up chapter 473 of the Great Analytics War, all those modern-day numbers that point to Subban being the better player aren't infallible. More than a few smart hockey people still prefer Weber right now, and that includes the brain trust behind Team Canada. If Weber is the better player today, it's at least possible he could stay that way for a while. After all, it's rare to see a defenceman maintain his level of play well into his 30s, but it does happen. And who's to say Subban isn't the one who loses a step?
She said American strikes against al-Nusra could "put those U.S.-backed fighters in a very tough situation, because they simply do not have the weaponry or the manpower to fight the Assad regime and ISIS, and now potentially the Nusra Front as well, at the same time."
After June's numbers were released earlier this month, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida, tried to give them a positive spin, talking about the importance of the auto industry for Ohio.
“Fifteen years have passed since September 11, billions of dollars have been spent and far too little change has occurred in Pakistan,” according to Congressman Matt Salmon of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He was speaking Tuesday at a hearing of the foreign-affairs group's Asia and Pacific subcommittee, which he chairs, titled: “Pakistan: Friend or Foe in the Fight against Terrorism.”
"It makes sense to involve all stakeholders in gathering information on practical policies and programs to encourage solar energy," said PSC Chairman Art Graham. He said the commission has concluded that expensive pilot programs currently in place have yielded insufficient results.
“Incentives can come in at a later stage. Today, people don't even consider buying an electric car because we don't see a charging station anywhere," Rathore added. Spokesmen for the department of heavy industries, and the ministry of new and renewable energy did not respond to emails.
Quorthon composed music for himself; never filling his pockets or allowing it to be corrupted by the masses or records labels. Bathory still burrows to the core and represents the top rung I measure all bands against when it comes to passion and spontaneity. For me, this is spirituality. And, after finishing my first year as a writer for Angry Metal Guy, I am honored to get a chance to shamelessly fanboy the hell out of a great musician and a great album for the the greatest metal blog on the interwebezphere.
Twitter user Adam Markopoulos shared a photo of Patriots coaches Bill Belichick and his girlfriend Linda Holliday catching a quick nap, which he says was taken on the Nantucket Ferry on its way back from the island Sunday afternoon.
Just hours after her brutal loss to Sanders in overwhelmingly white New Hampshire, New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries told reporters on the call that “issues of significance to communities of color will now be discussed and debated" as the nominating contest moves to Nevada and South Carolina. "When you match up the record of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, there simply is no comparison," he said. “She's been at the dance from the beginning of her career." In contrast, “Sanders has been missing in action on issues of importance to the African American community," Jeffries said, characterizing him as “a new arrival to the dance...at the twilight of his career.”
There is an old line on Levy that says he goes to work during a transfer window only on deadline day, such is his fondness for brinkmanship and last-minute business. It is tongue-in-cheek. Levy is confronted by a ceaseless barrage of issues and right now the biggest one involves keeping Pochettino's team together. It is a challenge he will confront with relish.
One: Ron Hextall saying that he would take a forward over a defenseman if they were close. That's among the most pointless statements a GM can make in the press, since we really don't know what the Flyers' internal draft board looks like -- but for the sake of argument, we'll take Hexy at face value here.
Take the case of Susan, recently featured on Montel Williams as an example of a woman being stalked by her ex-boyfriend. Turns out Susan is also stalking the boyfriend and--here's the sexual frisson--has slept with him only days ago. In fact Susan is neck deep in trouble without any help from the boyfriend: she's serving a yearlong stretch of home incarceration for assaulting another woman, and home is the tiny trailer she shares with her nine-year-old daughter.
This is class exploitation, pure and simple. What next--"homeless people so hungry they eat their own scabs"? Or would the next step be to pay people outright to submit to public humiliation? For $50 would you confess to adultery in your wife's presence? For $500 would you reveal your 13-year-old's girlish secrets on Ricki Lake? If you were poor enough, you might.
Whereas UK fishermen tend to blame the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) for their economic problems, the authors of this study say it proves that depletion stems from mismanagament well before the CFP came into existence.
As a result, the Lions had to use all seven of their active linemen and each one played at least 26 snaps, but none of the backups — tackles Emmett Cleary and Brian Mihalik and guard Tim Lelito — fared too well.
While the brief break will help some of the dinged-up linemen recuperate, Glasgow said he's going to focus on dissecting his previous performances and find out ways he can improve.
With Decker's return still up the air, though, Glasgow said protecting Stafford is always the top priority regardless of who is playing, and it's a job he and the rest of the offensive linemen take seriously.
As it turns out, O'Reilly never visited the Falklands during the war with the UK, but was merely present at a demonstration in Buenos Aires where bullets were fired, after the Argentinian junta surrendered. Moreover, no one was prepared to back up another O'Reilly tale that he “rescued” a wounded cameraman during the incident.
A BYRON Bay fisherman has survived a terrifying encounter with a massive great white shark after it charged his tinny off Julian Rocks, knocking him into the water.
Robbie Graham was fishing alone close to the Byron landmark on Wednesday morning and was reeling in a tuna when the unthinkable happened, according to friend and fellow amateur fisherman Hoss McGrath.
Last week two professional fishermen working the reef directly off Lennox Point had an astonishing 30 mackerel taken from them in the one session by what they believe was a pair of great whites.
LOCAL fisherman Hoss McGrath has had his fair share of great white encounters and says he's not surprised to see great whites around at this time of year despite popular wisdom they are more frequent in the winter months during the whale migration.
SV: Yeah, it takes time. But I feel like I'm right back to where I was a couple years ago when I was playing outfield, first and catching every week. So I feel comfortable. Am I as good as some of these other outfielders up here? No. Am I as good as some of the other first basemen up here? No. But I feel like I'm adequate and serviceable in the outfield or at first. And I feel like I'm going to make the routines plays, but I'm not going to be climbing any walls or doing anything that these guys can do.
“In the interior of North Carolina,” the editors observed, “the condition of the freedmen is scarcely better than that of slaves. Many are in fact still held under the lash, as is true to a great extent in South Carolina.”
Before the tsunami, a lot of old fishing gear would be on the beach. But afterwards, the debris included an inundation of Styrofoam and urethane, Pallister said. Objects such as property stakes and crates used by fishermen in coastal Japan also have begun showing up, he said.
These figures only represent the year 2013 -- though a look back at all of the BLS data from 1992-2013 yields that lumberjacks still have the highest job-related fatality rate, with an average of 99 deaths per 100,000 workers. Fishermen and aircraft pilots retain the second and third spots, with 90 and 72, respectively.
"We have a document that we've signed and we'll be giving out obviously, some announcement at some point," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes told CNN when asked if the members had agreed on the terms of their investigation.
Trump has personally intensified his attacks on the press as the steady stream of articles about Russian ties to his campaign have emerged. Behind the scenes, White House officials sought help from the men overseeing two of the congressional investigations: Nunes and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, according to a recent Washington Post report
The international community continues to perceive Fatah as the "moderate" Palestinian party with whom Israel should make peace. Yet Fatah is far from a single united bloc; many groups within the faction continue to seek the "liberation of Palestine" through armed struggle. Moreover, neither Abbas nor any of his senior Fatah loyalists have repudiated the war-set Fatah militias. Crucially, many of these Fatah militiamen continue to receive salaries from the Palestinian Authority.
The power play among Fatah militias in the Gaza Strip reflects the wider division among Fatah's political leaders. According to Palestinian sources, Fatah leaders in the Gaza Strip have truly become disassociated from the faction's leadership in the West Bank. Abbas's aides blame exiled Fatah strongman Mohammed Dahlan for the schism, claiming that he provides dissenting Fatah officials with money, in an attempt to undermine the Palestinian president, who is also head of Fatah. Abbas recently summoned Fatah leaders from the Gaza Strip to an emergency meeting in Ramallah to discuss Dahlan's growing influence in the Gaza Strip and the rifts in Fatah. The move came after thousands of Fatah members who are loyal to Dahlan staged a large demonstration in the Gaza Strip against Abbas. During the protest, they burned and trampled on pictures of Abbas.
Such developments in Fatah are notable for a specific reason: by and large, the international community continues to perceive Fatah as the "moderate" Palestinian party with whom Israel should make peace. Yet Fatah is far from a single united bloc; many groups within the faction, in their own words, continue to seek the "liberation of Palestine" through armed struggle. Moreover, neither Abbas nor any of his senior Fatah loyalists in the West Bank have repudiated the war-set Fatah militias. Crucially, many of these Fatah militiamen continue to receive salaries from the Palestinian Authority.

A temporary agreement on establishing a free trade zone between the Eurasian Economic Union and Iran is expected to be signed in 2017, Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission Board Tigran Sargsyan said on Monday.
Federal legislators must also take action. A number of California representatives, led by Congressman Adam Schiff (Democrat), have expressed bipartisan support for a warning system. However, with the House Interior Appropriations Bill now stalled, there is no prospect of funding this year. The USGS stands ready to deliver earthquake alerts, but it needs an extra $16 million a year to operate and maintain the system.
“It was the best option available,” Lequieu's girlfriend Debra Carter Pope said in an interview Thursday. “What's important to him and to me is family. … It's better than being in there for years and years.”

Spots in the side were categorised as: tall forwards, general forwards, tall defenders, general defenders, midfielders, wingmen and a ruck. An individual had to play at least 40 per cent of their football in a position to be considered there, with eight games being the qualification.
Atkins has more pressure acts than any other wingman in the AFL, and is No. 2 in metres gained for players in that position.
With help from fisherman and citizen scientists, researchers in Japan and the U.S. are tracking the nucleotides in the ocean creatures who swim in the plume of water tainted with radiation from Fukushima. Their research is part of a long-term effort to figure out when — if ever — certain fish will be safe to eat.
One would have to presume Brennaman is not talking about Cozart, but Locke. Perhaps that's a little harsh considering Locke was 8-2 this year with a 2.15 ERA entering the game and was selected as an All-Star. Aaaand he picked up the win today in a 3-2 Pirates victory…. so there's that. (As a few commenters and tweeters have pointed out, it's possible Brennaman could have been talking about Reds catcher Corky Miller, a recently promoted journeyman .185 career hitter who was batting after Cozart. So it definitely puts it up in the air who exactly Brennaman is talking about on the hot mic.)

It found that it was "unreasonable" for the ICAC to conduct Operation Hale, an investigation into whether Ms Cunneen encouraged her son's girlfriend to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after a crash.
What we really need, Congressman Ron Paul said in respect of the Fed when we spoke with him on the phone this morning, is a Wikileaks episode. He wasnt in any way suggesting that literally  or recommending any other kind of illegal raid on the Feds books; all his points favor acting only in lawful ways. What he was underlining is that the big document disclosure from the Fed is just the tip of the iceberg of what the public needs, and deserves, to know about what our nations central bank is doing.
The documents that have been released were disclosed by the Fed in the face of an array of pressures  from Bloomberg News, among others, and from the Congress, spurred by the socialist senator from Vermont, Bernard Sanders, against the backdrop of Congressman Pauls years long quest for some sunlight on the Fed. The disclosures show a vast rescue by the Fed of all sorts of institutions. Santa Clause: Fed Aid Went All Over; Companies, Banks, Offshore is the headline the Drudge Report put on the story.
Mr. Eisenbeis said there shoud be a strong forensic team  an outside group  to go in and look a vast Fed bailouts and do an analysis the way it was done after, say, the failure of Lehman Brothers. His comments were but an example of the logic of a proper, public, outside audit of the Fed, which has long been sought by Congressman Paul. His quest for a full audit may have gotten lost in the compromise of the Dodd-Frank legislation, but it is asserting itself. It is something that the poor suffering taxpayers, who are looking at all this with a sense of horror, will look to the 111th Congress to require.
Battles over oil and water have left humanity fighting over a barren dystopia, Theron gets her own “Come with me if you want to live” moment, and X-Men's Nicholas Hoult is unrecognizable as a young road warrior named Nux in the peek, which ends with another look at that desert fire tornado chase that had fanboys and girls panting at Comic-Con. “I was able to make the movie I wanted to make,” Miller told the Hall H crowd in July of the long-gestating $100M+ actioner. “WB allows the filmmakers their process.”
The adventures of Florida Man continue. A teenage Honda driver was nailed by the cops after a brief chase in St. Petersburg, Florida, earlier this month—only to claim that he never noticed the lights and sirens behind him, so desperate was he to reach his girlfriend and get lucky.
Eventually, Hughes came to a stop several blocks away from the initial location where the officer lit him up. After being read his rights, however, Hughes reportedly offered up an explanation for his brief dash away from the law: He claimed he never even noticed the lights and siren behind him, as he was hustling off with extreme dedication to, as the court report put it, "meet his girlfriend for relations."
When the Merchant Adventurers set up headquarters Bruges in 1344, it marked the beginning of a long period of commercial and artistic interaction between the Low Countries and England. Contacts were intense. In order to defend their interests, foreign merchants united in ‘Hansen', including the powerful ‘Flemish Hanse of London'. From 1463 to 1469 William Caxton stayed in Bruges as governor of the Merchant Adventurers. He learned the art of printing in Flanders and, on his return, installed the first printing press near Westminster Abbey in 1476. Later, when Elizabeth I provided a safe haven to Protestants from the Low Countries who had escaped Spanish persecution, the country received their skilled industry and commercial experience in return. Refugees introduced new trades to local economies, such as Canterbury silks, Norwich stuffs, or Yarmouth herring. Flemish and Dutch professional craftsmen and artists were enticed to cross the Channel. English ambassadors in the Low Countries functioned as industrial and artistic ‘spies'. The brain drain existed long before the term was invented. It is clear from Johan Frederik Bense's impressive Dictionary of the Low-Dutch Element in the English Vocabulary (1926) that many early words borrowed from Flemish/Dutch belong to the economic and commercial domains.

Facts about computer science at UW • Computer Science & Engineering was established as a graduate program in 1967, and as an undergraduate program in 1975. • The program is regarded as among the top 10 computer-science programs in the nation. The full-time graduate program is ranked sixth nationally by U.S. News & World Report. • It received $32.6 million in research grants and contracts in 2016 — up from $8.8 million when the Allen Center opened in 2003. • A new building, which is being funded through public and private money, is under construction. The 135,000-square-foot building is scheduled to be ready for occupancy in early 2019. The existing building, the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering, opened in 2003. • The graduate program has about 225 full-time students, and 175 students in a program geared toward working professionals. • The undergraduate program enrolls about 370 new undergraduates each year, up from 170 a few years ago, and offers two degrees: computer science and computer engineering. • Computer science is the most sought-after major listed by incoming freshmen at UW Seattle, but only about a third of undergraduates who apply get in.

Pai has publicly opposed net neutrality as championed by former Chairman Tom Wheeler since before the Open Internet order was put in place — and afterwards, published a 67-page critique of its implementation. He seems unlikely to be swayed, so this is really more gauntlet than letter that Senator Franken has sent his way.
For many years, craftsman Jesse Horn was frustrated with the direction of the North American firewood industry:
The stories tend to swing between SF and horror (something that Moore would use to his advantage during his run). A quick survey of the issues of this run bears that out. The monstrous Un-Men are Swamp Thing's first foes, led by Anton Arcane, who becomes Swamp Thing's nemesis. We also meet Abby Arcane, who becomes the key supporting character in the book and central to Moore's later issues (#2 and #3). There are appearances by a werewolf (#4), a brother and sister accused of witchcraft (#5), and a town full of robots (#6). Swamp Thing is linked to the wider DC universe in a team-up with Batman (#7), and H.P. Lovecraft's influence is evident in #8 when the people of Perdition, a mining town, are disappearing due to a monstrosity called M'Nagalah. Ghosts (#10), mutant worms (#11), and a gem that enables time travel (#12) swiftly follow. After Swamp Thing reveals his true identity to Matt Cable in #13, the SF / horror madness continues with a telekinetic child (#14); a priest / black magician and a demon called Nebrios (#15); Zombies on the island of Kala Pago (#16-17); old people leaching the vitality and youth of younger people in Serenity Village (#18); a fight with another Swamp Thing grown from an arm he lost in #5 (#19-20); a visit to an alien planet and an encounter with Solus, an alien ex-tyrant (#21); being captured by the government and placed in a facility with mutants (#22); encountering Holland's brother Edward and his girlfriend Ruth Monroe being attacked by Thrudvang (a monster); and regaining his humanity (#23-24).

Dejan Mladenovic, the defence counsel for one of Wilshere's friends, told Isleworth Crown Court: "I should say that Mr Wilshere, who received a caution from police in relation to the affray – on the Crown's case, it's accepted he was the individual who went outside on the road and spoke to Miss Plested and her boyfriend and made certain remarks to both of them. It was those remarks that initially sparked off this altercation."
The spokesman for the New Syrian Army group and a Syrian opposition activist said the operation will be coordinated with Iraqi tribesmen and Iraqi forces battling IS on the other side of the border. The extremist group has suffered a string of setbacks in both countries in recent weeks.
We can learn a lot from Democrats by what they oppose. While Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings tells us there is no vote fraud, fellow Maryland congressional candidate Wendy Rosen is committing federal felonies by voting both in Maryland and Florida. While the NAACP is leading the charge against photo voter identification, Lessadolla Sowers from the NAACP heads off to prison for voting for dead voters. While Brian Moran, Virginia's Democrat chair, rails against voter integrity, his nephew Pat is caught on camera plotting the use of forged documents at the polls to help President Obama.

The Rangers opened scoring for the first time since Game 2 after Sergei Zubov froze McLean before making a cross-ice feed to an open Brian Leetch, who had no trouble throwing the puck top shelf. Zubov assisted on the game's second goal as well, by Adam Graves' with Canucks defenceman Jyrki Lumme in the penalty box, at 14:45 into the first period.

In a second term, he said, he would focus more on aiding the poor and revamping prison policies. The pledge echoes moves by other conservative governors, including John Kasich of Ohio and Mike Pence of Indiana, as well as a growing number of GOP lawmakers such as House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Wis.), who worked for Brownback as legislative director in the mid-1990s.
Supersonic Avengers are the story of the smallest margins. It was one game away from finishing outside the top four and that game just happened to be against the team right below it. In its final game, it managed to beat The Flying Dutchmen 3-2, clinching a spot in the online finals by the smallest of margins. Supersonic Avengers are the final team with a positive goal difference (+11). With Snaski and his 59 saves as well as ELMP's 30 goals, this team is on the rise.
Moving on to the bottom half of the table, we have The Flying Dutchmen, which ended up on the wrong side of the tie with Supersonic Avengers. TFD did its best to try and finish in the top half by taking two games from We Dem Girlz, but it also ended up dropping games to Aeriality and Shoot N Goal. Dogu did his best to try and keep his team alive with an amazing 72 saves (second highest in the league), averaging over two a game. At the end of the day, The Flying Dutchmen failed to close out the games against the teams below it and that cost it a top half finish.
Vucic was information minister at the tail end of late strongman Slobodan Milosevic's disastrous rule during the 1990s, when federal Yugoslavia collapsed in conflict and Serbia was bombed by NATO to halt its killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo during a counter-insurgency war.
King, who divides his time between his native Maine and a home in Florida, is slim and fit at 65, flashing a frequently boyish and mischievous grin, though he still has a slight limp from the 1999 accident in which he was hit by a minivan while taking a walk. He continues to write accessible stories at a remarkable rate: A sequel to The Shining, titled Doctor Sleep, will be published in September, and he has “more or less” completed his first hard-boiled detective tale, Mister Mercedes. A series based on his 2009 novel Under the Dome will air on CBS later this summer, and his musical-theater collaboration with John Mellencamp, Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, will begin what King terms a “road show tour” of American cities in the fall.
My boyfriend has been teaching me how to draw my emotions. Basically I normally draw people, and those people tend to have whatever emotion I'm really feeling in their eyes (no matter what I do to "fix" it). He noticed this and is helping me draw the emotions straight onto the paper instead of making them squeeze through the cracks in some unrelated drawing.

Yet some things don't change. As the sputtering economy tries to get into gear, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan keeps talking about depriving hard working-taxpaying Americans of their retirement benefits, while offering nothing in return. This is the strategy that failed Mitt Romney and Ryan in November, and that alienates not just senior citizens, but voters over 45 — one of the few groups that's so far remained reliably right-leaning as Asians, Hispanics, upscale Episcopalians, graduate degree holders and others have abandoned the shrinking GOP tent.
If the President's electoral playbook called for uniting the rich and poor and treating the middle class as an afterthought, the Congressman has a more direct, if less palatable, approach: he simply attacks the middle class, by trying to gut their earned entitlement programs.
And in fact, Ryan the Midwesterner does seem to look to the South. He supported relief for the victims of Katrina, but opposed aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. At least on disaster funding, the Congressman can whistle Dixie. The question for the Republican Party is whether it has the will to change. After losing five straight elections to FDR's New Deal Coalition, the Republicans got their act together. Will history repeat itself?
"To be part of the Orthodox community, there is a certain lifestyle that is expected," she said. "Would we say, ‘Oh, please, would you and your boyfriend come over for Shabbos tea?' Probably not." But neither would somebody who went shopping in their car every Saturday morning be welcomed. "You wouldn't be part of the Orthodox community. Why would you want to be? You have chosen to live in a way that is not in consistency with that community."
But the costs of this approach could be very high, it was tagged with the "socialism" label; there was no on-the-shelf plan like this; and the government does not have the legal powers it needs to put nontraditional banks through the bankruptcy process, something that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke mentioned again and again in today's hearing. So that left the PPIP, which is much cheaper and less politically volatile and could be implemented under existing authority. But it is risky in that it relies on the creation of a set of economic incentives intended to induce the private sector to join the government in taking the assets off the banks' balance sheets.
Sources said there were around 60 Pesco officials whom the villagers forbade from disconnecting power supply. The officials including SDO Karak subdivision Hashmat Nawaz Leghari, superintendents Tariq, Ijaz and Mir Laiq and linemen Mohib, Farman and Anwar Hanan were attacked with clubs.
On 23 March 1986, while operating off coast of Libya, aircraft from the Saratoga, USS Coral Sea (CV 43) and USS America (CV 66) crossed what Libyan strongman Mohammar Khadafi had called the "Line of Death." The very next day at noon, three U.S. Navy warships crossed the same 32° 30' navigational line. Two hours later, Libyan forces fired SA-5 surface-to-air missiles from the coastal town of Surt. The missiles missed their F-14 Tomcat targets and fell harmlessly into the water. Later that afternoon, U.S. aircraft turned back two Libyan MiG-25 fighter planes over the disputed Gulf of Sidra. Soon after, aircraft from the three super carriers fought back in defense.
Replying to the judge later in her testimony, Romanelli said: "The door's open. I go in. There's blood. I take a shower. I don't know about you, but I really don't think that that's normal." After Romanelli reached the house, her boyfriend kicked in the door to Kercher's bedroom, where her body was found on the floor in a pool of blood. Other witnesses have testified that Knox earlier told those present that it was not unusual for Kercher to lock her room. But Romanelli said: "Meredith always left her door unlocked."
The prosecution maintains that Knox and her boyfriend faked a burglary. If the glass was on top of the clothes, it suggests the window was broken after the room was rifled.
Oubre is up for an extension on his rookie contract at the end of the season, and his career can go in a lot of different directions. All he's proved so far is that he's a hot head with an inconsistent jumper. The good news for him is that Washington has recent experience grooming a young wing. Otto Porter went from playing 8.6 minutes a game as a rookie to 19.4 minutes in his second season and 30.3 in his third. Oubre has the same opportunity. The Wizards turned over their second unit in the offseason, but their additions were either journeymen or unproven young guys. Oubre doesn't have much competition for shots or playing time. The only thing holding him back is himself.

If one of your crewmen does do something wrong – your chief engineer forgets to inform you that you're running low on energy, for example, or your tactical officer forgets to raise shields as you go into a fight – then it all falls apart very quickly. In many ways the captain has the hardest job – balancing the information being shouted at him by five other people and then deciding how best to proceed.

FBI agents began interviewing the girlfriend of Las Vegas massacre gunman Stephen Paddock as Donald Trump arrived in the city and said the killer must have had his "wires screwed up".
As mystery continued to surround his motive Paddock's girlfriend Marilou Danley, 62, a "person of interest" in the case, arrived at Los Angeles airport on a flight from the Philippines.
In January of the following year a group of eight young boys were attacked and managed to survive to tell their tale, which reached all the way to Louis XV, who granted a reward to the youngsters and followed up by sending his finest huntsmen to the countryside to find and kill the beast. While these marksmen tracked the wolf without success, the attacks continued unabated. One young woman met the beast on the road, and nearly killed it.
This massive wolf — known as Le Loup de Chazes — was triumphantly preserved and brought back and presented at the court of Louis XV. The huntsmen were fêted as victors over the dreaded beast.
On December 7, 2014 at the State Theatre in Portland, Maine the Trey Anastasio Band unveiled a re-worked version of “Never,” a song written by the Phish frontman and Tom Marshall that was originally debuted by Phish at the Bridge School Benefit in 1998. Anastasio performed “Never” twice in 2005 after its Phish debut and then the song was never played again by any of the guitarist's projects until that night in Portland. It would seem “Never” will appear on the new Trey Anastasio album, Paper Wheels, as a studio version of the song has been posted to Trey.com.

Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil"7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?8 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. 9 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. 10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."1Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,2Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:3If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blows the trumpet, and warn the people;4Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.5He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.6But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.7So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.8When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.9Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
Texas isn't generally considered a great place to surf, but there are good waves to be found if you know when and where to look. Photographer Kenny Braun is one of those people. “Surprisingly there are many people in Texas who don't even know there are beaches in Texas, much fewer surfers,” he said via email. “I think most people still associate Texas with either the cowboy or Dallas although, in reality, I think that there are probably more surfers than cowboys in Texas. And a few cowboys who surf as well.”
In 1855 Humboldt County was named after explorer Alexander Von Humboldt, who never saw the place, when it was split off from Trinity County. Other counties named after people include Glenn, named from wheat farmer Dr. Hugh Glenn and Lassen, named for trapper and frontiersman Peter Lassen. The last county, Imperial, was created in 1907 and named for the Imperial Land Company intent on reclaiming desert lands for agriculture.
Jonas Brodin, a 2011 first-round pick and stud defenseman that would have a chance to make the Wild if the lockout ends, will miss several weeks with a broken clavicle.
That's what some have painted the recall as, but the Wild has few other defensemen right now. If the Wild wanted to call up a fighter to make a statement, it would have brought in Josh Caron. Baldwin and Sean Lorenz are basically the only D left right now to call up with Medvec hurt, so Baldwin was chosen.

Why did this happen? How did Swift manage to squeeze water from the rocks of the record buying public? What is all this hoopla about her boyfriends and how she hates them all? Is she a salve for authenticity craving audiences everywhere or is she a highly calculated automaton birthed by some brutal capitalist from New York? I don't know, man, but read this anyway, I put a lot of time into it.
7. Right under our nose our son was using drugs. I work from home for the past 18 years. My office is two feet from his bedroom. I am home all the time. There was not one sign that could not be considered a typical teenage action. Danny went to school, he went to work at his part time job, and he had a girlfriend he adored. He ate dinner with us every night. He called home and reached out to us whenever he was out. He called me every day on his way home from school to see what we were having for dinner. He had conversations with us when he felt like it. He told us he loved us every single day. Sounds normal right? He never took money from my purse, occasionally he would take my debit card but I could see exactly what he did; fast food and gas in his car. He got angry once in a while, what teenager doesn't? He slept late and stayed up late; typical college student behavior. Does that sound like a drug abuser? Not to us especially after having gone through the teenage years with our older kids.
Are there good guys and bad guys in the Ukraine-Russian drama? Sure there are. We have courageous Ukrainian patriots who died in the Maidan for the dignity and freedom they believed in; corrupt and ruthless government officials who were willing to use force against their own citizens; Russian provocateurs eager to stir up trouble; extremist Ukrainian nationalists who are hardly democrats; and a Russian strongman who hosted the Olympics one week and invaded the territory of a sovereign country the next.
* Chairman Poetsch, former CFO, not under investigation
Current VW Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, the carmaker's finance chief at the time, is not being probed, the prosecutor's office said, without disclosing the name of the second top executive under investigation prompted by charges filed by Germany's BaFin financial regulator.
The unassuming Honolulu billionaire declined to say how much he has invested so far. The editor of the news service is veteran newspaperman John Temple, who served as editor, president and publisher of the Rocky Mountain News, which ceased publication in February 2009.
KH: Most of the money he had burned up [in a previous story]. So now he's heading to the city with, as the first issue of the arc puts it, "two pennies and a Nightwing suit to his name." He'll be subletting an apartment for a few weeks or months, depending on how long he's going to be in Chicago for Zucco. And when the Nightwing suit gets torn up he's going to have to figure out how to fix it. It's definitely much more of an everyman approach to the character. It's something I've been thinking about for a while now, ways to make him more relatable. That's also another reason why I chose Chicago. I chose a real city because I think that setting helps ground the story in a way that readers can relate to.
The weirdest twist was that after Fay had been convicted of the political charge of vandalism and was sentenced to six strokes of the cane; there was a news conference at the White House. It was a Friday, and President Clinton was with a visiting prime minister or president. One of the newsmen asked what about the Michael Fay case and this kid being caned. Clinton said he didn't know anything about it or didn't know the details, but he would get back to the reporter which, of course, sent the NSC staff into a swoon as well as us, because the last thing we needed was presidential involvement in a case like this.
“With so many government employees and so many military installations that Virginians were particularly impacted by the shutdown, it's not surprising that Cuccinelli suffered,” said Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. “Nowhere in America did any state's voters think that shutting the federal government down in order to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act was a good idea.”
There could also be a political element to Russia's resistance to looking itself in the mirror, said film producer Victoria Smirnoff, the only Russian woman who has publicly accused Weinstein of making unwanted advances on her. Smirnoff, now 43 and living in Switzerland, said Weinstein pushed her into the bathroom of her hotel suite in the early 2000s in Beverly Hills, where he fidgeted with the zipper of his pants. The incident didn't go further as her boyfriend saw something was amiss and knocked on the door.
In the aftermath of Beckerle's firing, Huntsman angrily called Lee a “vicious, vitriolic” woman and said he wanted her fired. Prior to Beckerle's reinstatement, he also said he wanted Pershing fired, saying he “should have been let go a long time ago.”
Huntsman reversed his position after the reinstatement, saying he had discovered the U. president was given bad information and that he hoped Pershing would remain in the position “for many years.”
However, when contacted about Lee's resignation, Huntsman said he wasn't sorry to see her go.
"He's taken what he learned from Bo, and he modernized it and put his spin on it," said former teammate, All-American offensive lineman John "Jumbo" Elliott said. "He has great enthusiasm, and he has that intensity."
Over the next 20 years, they funnelled around $13m to Citizens for a Sound Economy. In 2004, the organisation split into Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks, which is closely tied to the former Republican Congressman Dick Armey and has received no more funding from the Koch family.
As I discussed in this post, my physical appearance is a source of great anxiety. I worry that if I don't look perfect, then my boyfriend will lose interest in me and want to find someone else. I worry that other people will notice imperfections with my appearance and judge me harshly. Before I went through puberty, I considered myself to be extremely unattractive, and I never fully grew out of that mindset. Despite my appearance changing significantly, I still feel like the short, flat-chested, acne-ridden girl that I used to be. It is hard to shake away perceptions that you have had of yourself for so many years. Any imperfection in my appearance causes significant stress and anxiety. I try to remind myself that literally no one looks perfect, but it is difficult to listen to a voice of reason.
The letter is addressed to Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, whose proposal to do away with the net neutrality rules' legal framework is currently in a public comment period.
McCaskill is one of the most prominent opponents of MJIA, along with fellow Democrat and Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin, and Republicans Kelly Ayotte and Lindsey Graham. Gillibrand's amendment is likely to draw a filibuster, meaning she'll need fifty-nine supporters. So far forty-seven of her colleague have committed, including eight Republicans. Both sides are engaged in an intense campaign to win over some thirty undecided senators.

The investigation began in November 2015. The members of the criminal network recruited their victims in their country of origin using the Loverboy method, by a man who purported to be the victim's boyfriend and promised her a better life. Once in Spain, the victims were forced into prostitution in Madrid, Ibiza and Asturias. During the course of the investigation, police officers unveiled that some of the victims were forced to undergo plastic surgery. Furthemore, the women had to pay a tax in return of being protected on the street. The organised group extended their activity to Germany, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.
“You're probably going to find it only in your upscale grocery stores and upscale restaurants, and it's not going to be always available. It's probably not going to be cheap,” said Dave Bitts, a Eureka fisherman and adviser to the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fisheries in the federal waters off California, Oregon and Washington.
“It's going to be pretty poor,” said fisherman Mike Dvorak, while crabbing Monday just off Montara. “It's going to make a living in the fishing industry harder.”
There was a real-life Z, a guy Jess said she met when she started dancing at 18; and there was a real-life Jarrett, her boyfriend at the time, who Jess said was "quite the emotional fella."
Well there are a lot of rules down there, like you have to wear nipple covers and stuff, so it was very different from Detroit and Aziah was not happy about it. She made one dollar in two hours and she threw a fit. She was saying she couldn't go home to her boyfriend without having made any money on the trip. Jarrett was freaking out about us being late, so I called Z.
"We went to bed and I wake up to my phone again buzzing like crazy I look and of course it's Jarrett! He had posted on my Facebook that I suck old man dick for money. My family is seeing and commenting on this so I flip. That's when he tells me he gave all my stuff to a bum and was going for a walk. Hell no. So I call Z And we head over to the motel. Z snaps and makes Jarrett delete the post and find my things which btw are under the bed. As I have his phone it's starts blowing up and we see that not only is everyone from our home town texting him asking about the post but also a drug dealer from Tampa was texting. Z asks who he is and Jarrett explains that he told a random guy on the street his girlfriend is a prostitute and coming home with all kinds of money to pay for what the guy had fronted him. Z freaked out had him on the floor crying and admitting to being a bitch. He told him to grab his shit and start walking. Like the original story Jarrett starts punching himself in the face slamming his head off walls crying and acting a total fool."
Howard connected on 82 of his 150 attempts from three-point range, good for 54.7%, the highest percentage among qualifying Division I players. (His mark during Big East play was slightly higher: 57.3% on 96 attempts.) Howard's marksmanship earned him a spot on the conference's all-freshman team last season and its preseason second-team for 2017–18, boosted an offense that ranked among the top 10 in the country on a per-possession basis and helped the Golden Eagles claim their first NCAA tournament berth since Steve Wojciechowski was hired as the program's head coach in '14.
• SI's Projections: Top 100 scorers | Top 100 transfers | Top 50 freshmen | NPOY
The three-point percentage that Howard put up last season is ridiculous on its face, but it's even more staggering when placed into context. He's one of only 17 players since the 1992–93 season to attempt at least 140 threes and connect at a 50% clip or better. Howard is the only freshman in that group, and he bested 15 of the other 16 members of it with his 54.7 3FG%. If we lower the minimum attempt threshold to 100, Howard stands out as one of only six freshmen since 1992–93 to sink at least half of his triples. One of the others was a Golden Eagle: NBA journeyman Steve Novak.
To get a better sense of Howard's impact in 2016–17, consider that he is one of only four freshmen since the 2010–11 season who posted a usage percentage of at least 25 in a minimum of 20 minutes per game with an Offensive Box Plus/Minus—a statistic that weighs contributions on that end of the court—of eight or more. The three others were guards who went one-and-done before being selected in the lottery of the NBA draft. You won't find Howard on any credible 2018 mocks right now, chiefly because of his physical limitations.

Remember when Brad Pitt starred in that high school slasher movie? Yeah, you know the one—Cutting Class? It's that one where he plays a jock named “Dwight Ingalls” whose girlfriend won't sleep with him “until his grades improve,” because that was teenage culture of the late ‘80s in a nutshell. But wait, is it just me or do others have eyes for Brad's girl as well? Yes, it's the weird, loner kid who just got released from a mental institution! And the creepy principle played by Roddy McDowall! Who will end up dead, and whose career will scrape along for a few more years before exploding into superstardom? My money is on McDowall.
'Whale sharks are gentle animals and present zero threat to people and the fishermen we worked with welcomed us to their village.
Mr Heinrichs described how they were able to take the incredible shots, by tapping into the knowledge of locals in the Philippine village of Oslob, where fishermen have developed a special bond with the whale sharks they share the ocean with.
'Each day the whale sharks come in to the shallow waters of the village and the fishermen feed them small handfuls of tiny shrimp,' he said.
And that is the key to understanding the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee: deeply down, she truly believed that the White House was hers, that she was owed the election victory, it was her f(ornicating) turn, damn it, and in losing the election she was not just beaten by a political neophyte, but wronged, wronged by James Comey and Matt Lauer and The New York Times and the white women who were supposed to vote with their genitals rather than their brains — they “disrespected themselves,” don't you know — the “basket of deplorables, and husbands and boyfriends telling their wives and girlfriends that there's no sense wasting their votes on her, she's going to be in jail.
Berkshire District Attorney David Capeless said the assaults allegedly occurred Sunday at Camp Lenox in Otis, where Somerville was holding an annual team-building retreat. He said the three Somerville High School juniors, members of the boy's junior varsity team, assaulted three freshmen in a cabin.
SC Spokesman Theodore Te told a press conference Tuesday afternoon that the Court annulled the criminal case for "insufficiency of evidence" and ordered her "immediate release."
Washington should also reverse its expensive expansion of military forces in Asia—the so-called “Asia pivot”—and reconsider the folly of the AirSea Battle doctrine. According to Raoul Heinrichs of Australian University, ASB “will greatly increase the range of circumstances for maritime brinkmanship and dangerous naval incidents.” Establishing military “hot lines” between the major powers in the region would also be helpful.
Choo's injury came just as Grady Sizemore was taking batting practice for the first time since July 18. The Indians are also without designated hitter Travis Hafner, who may need season-ending foot surgery. Also, starting second baseman Jason Kipnis and outfielder Michael Brantley are hurt.
"It's tough and when guys get banged up but part of the game," said third baseman Jack Hannahan, who couldn't remember the last time the Indians were healthy. "It's tough on these guys coming up to be thrown in the fire in a race. It's a lot of pressure."

Even when a congressional majority agrees with the president and passes a law the president signs, there's little confidence he will faithfully execute the law as written. Why pass comprehensive immigration reform, for example, if it includes tight border security or deportation measures with which the president disagrees and may ignore? As Congressman Paul Ryan put it, “Here's the issue that all Republicans agree on: We don't trust the president to enforce the law.” The president's failure to faithfully execute has made Congress grind to a halt and with it, democracy itself.
Fox News anchor Sean Hannity floated Meadows name, along with House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan, as possible replacements for Ryan. But Meadows noted that he's never talked to Hannity and said he wasn't suggesting a challenge when he made the comment on Thursday, but was just discussing the dynamic he's hearing about from voters in his state.
With the fourth place team from the last World Cup, the finalists of Euro 2012 and… um… Costa Rica… then anybody's reaction would immediately be a negative one from an English perspective. Even the Chairman of the Football Association, Greg Dyke, indicated to Roy Hodgson that there is no hope of England getting out of the group stage by figuratively cutting his throat.
We know all this because a gentleman named Christopher DePascale was right next door, using his phone to film Sanders' every move.
On 22 June, a North Korean Yugo-class submarine became entangled in a fishing driftnet in South Korean waters approximately 18 km east of the port of Sokcho and 33 km south of the inter-Korean border. A South Korean fishing boat observed several submarine crewmen trying to untangle the submarine from the fishing net. The fishing boat notified the South Korean navy and a corvette towed the submarine with the crew still inside to a navy base at the port of Donghae.[1][2] The submarine sank as it was being towed into port, it was unclear if this was as a result of damage or a deliberate scuttling by the crew.[3]
On 25 June the submarine was salvaged from a depth of approximately 100 feet (30 m) and the bodies of nine crewmen were recovered; five sailors had apparently been murdered while four agents had apparently committed suicide.[5] The presence of South Korean drinks suggested that the crew had completed an espionage mission.[6] Log books found in the submarine showed that it had infiltrated South Korean waters on a number of previous occasions.[7]

For Bismarck and his professorial henchmen, deadly foes of "Anglo-Saxon" freedom as they were, this welfare state program was the consummation of the historical mission of Germany's ruling Hohenzollern dynasty as well as of the social gospel of a new Christianity. This Sozialpolitik provided a common ground for the cooperation of churchmen and atheists, of royalists and republicans, of nationalists and internationalists. Capitalism had multiplied population figures and raised the average standard of living to an unprecedented height. Yet all these groups were united in the fight against capitalism's alleged inhumanities.
BOSTON, MA – Boston Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli announced today, December 28, that defenseman Dennis Seidenberg will miss the remainder of the 2013-14 season with a torn ACL/MCL in his right knee. The expected recovery time for Seidenberg is 6-8 months.
Chiarelli also announced that the team has recalled defenseman Zach Trotman from Providence on an emergency basis and assigned goaltender Niklas Svedberg to Providence. Trotman will join the team in Ottawa Saturday and be eligible to play in Saturday night's game.
The 6'3", 219-pound defenseman hails from Noblesville, Indiana and was drafted by Boston in the seventh round (210th overall) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft.

Half of those under 30 are unemployed. These young people are trapped in a broken land with little hope of economic opportunity. The blockade's restrictions on Gaza's fishermen mean they can sail only three nautical miles from the coast, impoverishing their families.

A 24-year-old man is suspected of killing his girlfriend and leaving her body in barrel inside his Harlem apartment for several days, a law enforcement source said. (Published Monday, March 4, 2013)
A 24-year-old man is suspected of stabbing his girlfriend to death and leaving her body in a 55-gallon barrel inside his Harlem apartment for several days, the medical examiner said.
According to the law enforcement source, the woman was planning on leaving her boyfriend to move to the Dominican Republic.
Her boyfriend is in custody at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital under psychiatric care. Police believe the woman may have been dead since Wednesday.
A woman whom he identified as his girlfriend tried to inform police of his mental health issues, O'Mara said.

From the joys of exploration to the simple pleasures of curling up in your own quarters (often with a hot yeoman and a cold drink), from the value of friendship to the value of calling someone's bluff, I've learned dozens of life skills, lessons and even values from the iconic show that ran only three years in prime time when it originally debuted (before I was born).
“My first thought, apart from it being so strange and narcissistic—and assuming that everyone wants to live forever, which I certainly don't—is that I'd need my girlfriend and all my friends and family to be frozen with me. It would be too weird otherwise. I'd be starting over at 51 with people going around in space suits and, you know, hoverboards looking at me weird. I don't think I'd do it unless the scientists said, ‘We can freeze you for a year and we'll have this drug ready by then. It's either that, or you're going to die tomorrow.' Then I might do it, but certainly not to see the future. I can't be giving up the next however many years I've got with my loved ones to see how Coca-Cola turns out.”
Why couldn't he answer yes or no? Because he likely knows he's in hot water for even suggesting his conversations were recorded and threatening to release them. So President Trump will have to confer with his attorneys as to the best way to weasel out of his empty threat. Of course, for all of the fanboy talk of Trump being the tough guy alpha male, he's going to hide behind his lawyers instead of just saying, “There are no tapes.”

In many cases frame switching is helpful – you assimilate faster to a new environment, tailoring your thinking to that of the other people around you. For example, in the Prisoner's Dilemma task, where a person chooses to either cooperate or defect, Chinese Americans switched strategies adaptively: when “primed” with Chinese symbols like dragons or yin-yang, they preferred to cooperate (in line with Chinese ideals of harmony); when shown pictures of superman and the Statue of Liberty, they tended to act like western economists and defect more. Culture cues are like magnets that attract and activate a network of “thinking” that we associate with a culture – this is great, since we better fit in.
Garn was chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and served on three subcommittees: Housing and Urban Affairs, Financial Institutions, and International Finance and Monetary Policy. He also was a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and served as Chairman of the HUD-Independent Agencies Subcommittee. He served on four other Appropriations subcommittees: Energy and Water Resources, Defense, Military Construction, and Interior. Garn served as a member of the Republican leadership from 1979 to 1984 as Secretary of the Republican Conference.
As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Garn was co-author of the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the law that partially deregulated the savings and loan industry and attempted to forestall the looming Savings and Loan crisis.
Say Nothing, While I Stampede Congress Sept. 21 (EIRNS)U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told Presidential candidates Obama and McCain to hold off presenting their own plans for the financial meltdown, while he briefed Congress that they must enact his own plan immediately. On CNN's Late Edition today, a Huffington Post correspondent reported that Paulson had asked both Presidential candidates to hold back and propose nothing, while Paulson presented his own plan to Congress. Obama, who was meeting with former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin on Thursday and about to present something, dutifully obeyed Paulson, the correspondent said, while McCain, being the loose cannon that he is, began instead to talk about his own plan for an MFIa Mortgage Finance Institution. American economist Lyndon LaRouche has called Paulson's hyperinflationary bailout a treasonous swindle.
And then she came through the door, and in the minute it took her to walk to our booth, my jumbled mass of thoughts clarified into one:. Fifteen minutes later I not only realized I wasn't jealous anymore, I realized Iher. We had a lot in common, made each other laugh, and both liked so many of the same qualities in Joel. A few days later she and I went on our first date, and though she's not dating either of us any longer, I now consider her one of my closest friends. As with many things in Joel and my relationship, meeting metamours got so much easier after that. (I met the most recent one randomly when I ran into them on their way out to dinner. It was no big deal. It was a quick, "Hello!" and smile and wave. I walked away grinning stupidly at the awesomeness of our lives.)But as with many things in Adam and my relationship, the metamour situation was a little more complicated. There wasn't fear of the unknown - I knew his wife before I met him, in fact - but once Adam and I started dating, things shifted for me in how I thought about her. She was no longer just my friend - now she was the wife of a guy I'd fallen for really hard. I stopped feeling like I could talk to her as freely as I used to. I felt awkward around her at parties. Instead of embracing her as my newfound metamour into being all those great things she was before, I pulled back from her all together.But of course becoming more distanced from her made me feel worse, so with some prodding from Joel and Adam I decided to just tell her about everything: about how this was my first time dating a married man, my first time being a secondary to anyone at all, and on top of it, my first time in a long time feeling the way I feel about her husband. Her response was not surprising, and made me feel silly for having waited so long to have this conversation:A few days later she and I met for dinner, and my anxiety was gone. We got to know each other even better. She told me stories about their past that didn't make my stomach clench. And, best of all, we talked a lot about how great Adam is -- how cute he is when he does or says or wears something, and how much being with him makes us both happy. It might have been the delicious German beer we were drinking, but that dinner left me so warm and fuzzy I was mushy for days.Since then, I've obviously felt closer to Adam's wife but also have felt closer to Adam, because I knew for a fact that everyone involved is rooting for us. It's not that I ever felt disapproval, it was that I needed that approval to come from personal interactions with her before I truly believed it. There are still times I feel a pang when I think about the ways that they are close that we are not, but that's a natural side effect of both being in love with someone new and also being a secondary (which is something that I'll probably think about and reflect on more in posts to come). At least now I know that I can push back any irrational worries about disapproval and move on.There are two things I've learned from these two experiences I hope to carry with me when the next challenge comes along: A. My boyfriend and partner are great, and it would make sense that anyone else who agrees with me will also be great, and B. Metamours aren't there to be feared, but to be embraced. They are there to learn from and learn with, support, and commiserate with (in a healthy, non-gossipy way), and best of all, to gush with. Because who better to appreciate the sickening, rambling mush that comes from puppy love than someone else who's felt it too?As with everything, becoming comfortable with metamours is challenging. Not everyone will always want to form the close relationships I find the most rewarding. But also as with everything I've found in poly so far, working at developing those relationships in ways that work best for everyone involved is worth the challenge. I have too many complicated emotions about relationships to go it alone. Besides, how else will you figure out what to get your new boyfriend for his birthday?

The announcers guess it's about “six feet off the ground”, and it's actually so low that it almost didn't make this post because I couldn't quite tell if it bounces before third baseman David Bell catches it.
This throw gets my vote because it has everything: comedy, redemption, power, accuracy, awe. Guillen waits at the wall for a full second and looks like he has his leap timed perfectly before the ball suddenly hits him square on the head/shoulder and dribbles onto the warning track. He picks it up, takes one mighty crow hop, and uncorks a throw that defies classification. It's arcing and at the same time flat. It's warping the space and time 15-20 feet above the field. And then it hits the third basemen at the letters with plenty of time to spare. (The announcers guess he was out by “about five or six feet.”)
The United States has shelved the handover of two leftover frigates to Turkey, as Congress excluded Turkey from a bill seeking permission to transfer vessels to foreign countries, citing Mediterranean tensions.The U.S. approved the “Naval Transfer Act” bill in late December, approving the transfer of six naval frigates to Mexico and Taiwan, but eliminated Turkey over political concerns.In the 2012 version of the “Naval Transfer Act,” Turkey was to receive two Oliver Hazard Perry class guided missile frigates, the USS Halyburton and the USS Thach, which are being decommissioned by the U.S. Navy.However, some members of Congress objected to the transfer of naval frigates to Turkey, mainly citing the county's strained relations with Israel and Greek Cyprus in the Mediterranean.“I believe we should hold off on sending powerful warships to Turkey and encourage the government in Ankara to take a less belligerent approach to their neighbors,” Congressman Eliot Engel reportedly said during that debate.Congress members particularly emphasized Turkey's tension with Greek Cyprus over energy sources off the divided island and its threats against natural gas exploration by American companies in the region.“Turkey has recently threatened legitimate [Greek] Cypriot and Israeli efforts to cooperation on energy exploration. Ankara has boosted Turkish armed naval presence around the natural gas fields between Israel and Cyprus and declared invalid an agreement between Cyprus and Israel on demarcating their respective energy exploration areas,” another congressman, Brad Sherman, has been quoted as saying.Turkey is one of around a dozen countries that can manufacture its own warships thanks to its national warship program called Milgem.Two corvettes designed and built by the local manufacturers, Heybeliada and Büyükada, have been completed in 2008 and 2011. The completed ships have been handed to the Navy, but annulment of the contract with the manufacturer company has slowed down the program.
There is little doubt that of all the early missionaries Samuel Marsden is the best remembered. It was his investigations that first showed that the Maori attacks on ships and their crews were usually the result of previous assaults by the seamen on the natives. It was in December, 1814, that Marsden first visited New Zealand. It is a striking commentary on the state of the country at the time, that before leaving Sydney he wrote to the Rev. J. Pratt, Secretary of the Church Missionary Society: “I leave my family under Divine protection. If I should be spared to return to them I shall be able to provide for all their wants; but if Providence should otherwise determine, I recommend them to the kind consideration of the Society.”
Marsden was accompanied on his voyage in the brig Active by several Maori chiefs, returning from Sydney, as well as Thomas Kendall, who had been appointed magistrate to remain in the country. This appointment was made on Marsden's recommendation, with a view to effecting some control over the licentiousness of the whalers and seamen visiting New Zealand. Three of the chiefs — Dewaterra, Shunger and Kora Korra—were named in Governor Macquarie's order of November 9th, 1814, as being invested with somewhat similar powers. Incidentally, Marsden uses a slightly different spelling for their names than that quoted in the official order.

But Borden had much more justification for being at, say, the Paris Peace Conference, than Mr. Harper has for grandstanding in Ukraine, junketing in Israel, or hobnobbing at pointless G8 meetings. And notwithstanding Borden's real statesmanship abroad, his government and his party eventually paid a huge price in Canada when incompetent lieutenants, such as the arch-partisan Arthur Meighen, alienated one domestic constituency after another.

It helped converted third baseman and sinkerballer Bob Lemon get to the Hall of Fame; he had 37 home runs as a pitcher, one fewer than Wes Ferrell. Warren Spahn hit 35, Red Ruffing 34 as a pitcher, Earl Wilson 35; back in 1966, when the Orioles were headed to a world championship and the Red Sox were headed to ninth place, my brother Ned drove to Baltimore's Memorial Stadium and saw Earl Wilson win a 2-1 game in which he hit a walk-off home run in the tenth inning. Don Drysdale hit 29. Carlos Zambrano hit 24. Rick Wise hit 15, including two while throwing a no-hitter.
Zack Greinke? He is this generation's Greg Maddux, brilliant in dissecting hitters, a tremendous fielder, good hitter. Andrew Cashner is a superbly athletic fielder, hitter. Tim Hudson was an All-American outfielder at Auburn. Joe Kelly was a college outfielder. Mike Hampton could do absolutely everything. Sean Doolittle was a tremendous first baseman at Virginia and a high draft pick as a hitter. Mike Leake and Henderson Alvarez could probably play in the infield. Scouts who watched Brad Lincoln in the Cape League in 2005, when he finished second to Evan Longoria in homers, wonder what would have happened had he hit every day in the minors and kept with the routine that made him the fourth pick in the 2006 draft.

Even though there are little to none structural variations between the original song and this cover, this is still a great recording. What makes it so good is the fact that Faith No More performs “War Pigs” with an energy that most bands are not able to display even when playing their own material. The cover even became a fixture in their live shows, as a quick YouTube search will prove. The biggest highlight here is undoubtedly Mike Patton's distinctive voice. Few vocalists, regardless of genre, are as iconic as Ozzy Osbourne. Patton is definitely one of them. I can't think of a single metal frontman better suited to cover one of Ozzy's best performances of all time.
The victim's sister was in the house the victim emerged from moments prior to the shooting, and said she used to date Sutton, but broke things off. She said she'd been receiving messages and texts from Sutton that “scared her,” and said she and Sutton's current girlfriend has been “feuding on Facebook.” The victim's sister and another individual identified Sutton as the person who exited the vehicle seen in the surveillance video moments before the shooting.
Sutton's girlfriend said when they arrived at the house, Sutton peeked into the windows and believed the victim's sister was home with her kids, and Sutton planned to “kick in the door and beat her up.” While they were in the alley, the victim came to the area near the garbage cart, and Sutton saw him, and “said he was going to shoot him,” reaching his hand across his girlfriend's body, and shooting the victim through the vehicle's passenger window. After the shooting, Sutton's girlfriend said Sutton said he believed the victim was his ex-girlfriend's brother, and to “(expletive) him, because he owes Sutton $20.”

The Vancouver Canucks, as noted by Thomas Drance at Canucks Army, are one of the teams expected to make a run at the British Columbia native if he doesn't sign with Anaheim. Schultz (6-2, 185 pounds) led all NCAA defensemen in scoring for the second straight season.
Mike Eaves, Schultz's college coach, has seen several high-end defensemen come through Madison, including Toronto's Jake Gardiner and Detroit's Brendan Smith. In April, he told Oilers Nation that Schultz has offensive "magic" that's easy to notice, including the ability to jump into the rush and put shots on net, and added that he has improved his strength and defensive positioning skills.

Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani has said that the telecom unit is “ready” to roll out its fourth-generation (4G) services, and will cover 80% of India's 1.3 billion population by the second half of 2016.“We are ready to launch (4G services) and in the second half of 2016, 80% of India's population will have high-speed mobile broadband Internet . So, 80% of India's 1.3 billion Indians will have high-speed mobile Internet,” Ambani said in a television interview to CNN International's Fareed Zakaria aired on Sunday.RIL will be offering high-speed broadband services through its unit, Reliance Jio Infocomm, which is the only telco to own 4G bandwidth across India. Jio is widely expected to launch commercial services around April, a development which experts say will disrupt the market by bringing in intense competition on tariffs.“By 2017 end, we would cover 90% and by 2018, all of India will be covered by this digital infrastructure,” Ambani said.The oil-to-telecoms conglomerate on December 27 last year had soft-launched its 4G services, offering connections to its nearly 120,000 staff members, associates and their families, and offered 4G SIM cards and discounted LYF-branded 4G-supporting handsets through its retail arm Reliance Retail.Jio has said that it would have invested over Rs100,000 crore by the time of its commercial launch in buying spectrum, setting up networks, in marketing and sales and in human resources, among others.When asked about the massive investments RIL is making in its telecom foray, Ambani said spending on creating a digital infrastructure is “a very good investment”.The country's richest man said that India could not be left behind in global digital revolution.“In the next 20 years, in a network society, we are going to have a change much more than what we have seen in the last 100 years," Ambani said, adding that digitisation will be at the forefront of the digital revolution."As we saw in the year 2012-13, India is 150th in the world in mobile broadband penetration as well as quality. And Jio has really been conceived to change this position," the Indian billionaire said.Mukesh Ambani's 4G foray is his re-entry into telecom sector after the public split with his younger brother Anil Ambani that led to the conglomerate's telecom business going to his brother. Anil runs the telecom business under Reliance Communications.After a patch up some years back, the two brothers are now cooperating to offer 4G services across India and are poised to take on established players like market leader Bharti Airtel, No. 2 telco Vodafone India and third ranked Idea Cellular. The incumbents though have already launched their respective 4G services, with Airtel having the largest footprint in the country, in over 350 cities and towns.Reliance Industries had obtained pan-India Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum in 2010 by buying out a company which had won 4G airwaves for Rs 12,847.8 crore. But technological challenges around the 2300 Mhz bandwidth won then has meant that Jio is yet to launch commercial services.It though has subsequently acquired airwaves in other 4G bands, and now has the highest quantum of spectrum across the 800 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,300 MHz bands.India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) in a recent finding said that RIL's proposed 4G launch will intensify competition and is poised to squeeze market share, EBITDA margins and credit metrics of core incumbent players such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.

For the February 27 1940 issue of Look weekly, Siegel and Shuster were commissioned to create a two-page expose showing How Superman Would End The War. After he pummels Germany's fortifications on the Siegfried Line, Superman grabs Hitler and Stalin and flies them to Geneva where they are found guilty of "unprovoked aggression against defenceless countries" by the League Of Nations, forerunner of the UN. This condemnation of the Nazis seems to have worked as propaganda. It reportedly infuriated Joseph Goebbels, himself a master propagandist, so much that he angrily proclaimed "Superman is Jewish!" in a meeting. Not long after, on April 25 1940, the SS newspaper Das Schwarze Korps ran an anonymous full-page counter attack, probably written by Goebbels, denouncing the "intellectually and physically circumcised" Jerry Siegel as "a Colorado beetle" who "works in the dark, in incomprehensible ways" on American children.
In his Look strip, Superman was restrained from giving the captive Fuhrer "a strictly non-Aryan sock on your jaw". A year later, another Jewish partnership, New Yorkers Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, unleashed their super-patriot Captain America, garbed in the stars and stripes flag, who finally gave Hitler that threatened punch on their first issue's front cover. This was too much for some American Nazi sympathisers and opponents of their country entering the war. Simon and Kirby's studio became the target of hate mail, obscene phone calls and sinister types lurking outside, until mayor Fiorello LaGuardia himself rang Simon to assure him of round-the-clock police protection, saying, "You boys over there are doing a good job. The city of New York will see that no harm will come to you." Once the war was won, however, Captain America hung up his shield. Somehow his comeback as a 50s "commie basher" in the Cold War and Korea never caught on.
Moody told deputies he awoke to find the home completely filled with smoke, and quickly realized his girlfriend and children were missing.

When Martinez appeared in the press box during the third inning, he was surrounded by a wall of 50 cameramen and reporters, his comments completely inaudible. That's great – but why are there so many now when there were only five reporters to talk to him after he pitched? It's one of the enduring mysteries of Montreal.
Assemblyman Mike Gatto, chairman of the California State Assembly's Utilities & Commerce Committee, issued a statement yesterday (hat tip, Ars Technica ) indicating some form of government penalty if Frontier can't get its ducks in a row. “There has been an alarming rate of telephone and Internet outages in Southern California and consumers are frustrated with the lack of a solution to this months-long ordeal,” Gatto said. "These problems need to be resolved swiftly. Cities are unable to live stream council meetings and residents are at risk because of the inability to dial 911 in an emergency. My committee will hold hearings on the impact on our constituents and the appropriate government response if these problems persist." Local news outlets in California, Texas and Florida remain filled with stories by customers that are fed up by the sloppy transition. Frontier originally had promised all remaining problems would be resolved by mid-April, but such complaints have now persisted into May. Frontier, meanwhile, issues the same statement each time the company is asked why the transition wasn't smoother, and just what kind of timeline the company sees for resolution. “We are continuing to resolve customer issues as they come to us,” Frontier says of the ongoing problems in California. “As you're aware, we are transitioning more than 1 million customers in California to Frontier-provided services. With a transition of this size and geographic scale, there will be issues that need to be addressed and that's what we're focused on.” “We are continuing to resolve customer issues as they come to us,” Frontier says of the ongoing problems in California. “As you're aware, we are transitioning more than 1 million customers in California to Frontier-provided services.

Rounding off the Bullets' team they picked up Elise and Leona as their last picks. Kakao is no stranger to Elise; it's a champion that he had much success with in the past. Leona became much stronger due to the changes in 3.14 and paired up with Ezreal this is a flashback to Season 2 duo lanes. At this point Sword sees Lee Sin and Elise being picked up but there are no guarantees that which champion will be going top and which will be going to the jungle. As Sword's last pick they chose Vayne in the marksman position for Pray. They heavily considered picking Twitch as it is one of Prays stable champions but between Leona, Elise, and Lee Sin, Twitch will have a really tough time surviving in a team fights.

“We're very pleased that FIFA allowed us to extend our deal as the exclusive U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster of FIFA World Cup tournaments through 2026,” said Joe Uva, NBCUniversal's Chairman of Hispanic Enterprises and Content. “This unprecedented agreement gives our Telemundo and NBCUniversal viewers and digital consumers more of the world's best soccer for the next 12 years."
All jokes aside, Jagr along with Zubrus and Travis Zajac have formed quite a trio that has been the team's most consistent line game-in and game-out for about a month now. “Yeah I think we are playing well,” said Zajac of he and his linemates, “we're big, we're strong, we cycle the puck well.” The Devils no. 1 center is used to playing with high-profile/super talented wingers (see: Kovalchuk, Zach Parise) and has really thrived since he was put together with the future Hall-of-Famer. “Jagr's a big guy; he's got a heavy stick and he's hard on pucks. He wins a lot of battles down low and on the wall. It's easy as a centerman to just find spots and he'll get you the puck,” said Zajac. “You're stick always has to be on the ice (anticipating a pass) with him. He's a guy that can make passes through sticks and through bodies when you least expect it.” When asked about their line, and its success, Jagr gave similar praise to Zajac. “I like this line from the first time we played together, once we are in the offensive zone we are very good; I think we should be able to make more plays in the neutral zone, give-and-go plays,” he said. “The key is Travis; he starts it defensively with face-offs. He's a key guy, I like playing with him.”
Jagr, following certain games has gone out of his way to praise some of the role players and younger players on the team, like rookie defenseman Eric Gelinas. “It's a great pat on the back coming from a guy like that. I appreciate those words, like you said it's only happened a couple of times,” Gelinas told the Hockey Writers with a grin. “I'm trying to work on having that happen on a regular basis. It's definitely nice to hear coming from a guy like that.” Gelinas wasn't even born yet when Jagr made his NHL debut during the 1990-91 season, so it's had quite an impact on the rookie being teammates with a living legend. “It's pretty amazing playing with a future Hall-of-Famer,” said the 22-year-old with a huge grin as he glanced across the locker room at Jagr. “I think he's now sixth in NHL scoring all-time, that's pretty special. He's a great player and he does it even though he's the oldest guy on our team. He's just amazing.”
"I was excited,' Wharton said. "As an offensive lineman you live for those challenges to go for it, pick up the first down and keep the drive rolling."
“The overwhelming response we've had already confirms what we've always known, that Hyperloop One is at the forefront of a movement to solve one of the planet's most pressing problems,” said Hyperloop One cofounder and Executive Chairman Shervin Pishevar. “The brightest minds are coming together at the right time to eliminate the distances and borders that separate economies and cultures.”
A few days ago I had an unexpected visitor: the well-known Zionist leader Dr. Weizmann. He is a tall, elderly, elegantly dressed gentleman with a pale yellow tinge to his skin and a large bald patch on his head. His face is very wrinkled and marked by dark blotches of some kind. His nose is aquiline and his speech calm and slow. He speaks excellent Russian, although he left Russia forty-five years ago.
I wore these shoes to a bar later that day and my feet swelled up so much that they wouldn't fit in the shoes and my boyfriend had to carry me home. Moral of the story: Don't ever leave your house. FOX/Kathleen Kamphausen
JK: Intangibly, I think UTSA just cooled their nerves at the half time. Guys were overextending themselves to try to make big plays as they were understandably juiced up to start a new era of UTSA football under their new head coach. The team started to play within itself in the second half and it prevented mental mistakes. UTSA also made some changes in the gap assignments between the defensive linemen and linebackers which prevented Alabama State from blocking UTSA defenders out of the play.The shift lead to UTSA shutting down the Alabama State run game that had made some big gains in the first half.

"While Secretary King had some good things to say about homeschooling, I'm disappointed that his comments imply that public schoolers have a wider range of options in education, which is simply not true," said HSLDA co-founder and Chairman Michael Farris. "Homeschoolers are far outperforming their public schooled peers, largely due to the fact that parents know what works best for their child instead of implementing an outdated, one-size-fits-all approach that Secretary King appears to favor."
It's okay after the breakup to distance yourself or set some boundaries in order to protect your heart—give it some time to heal. On the other hand, you have a responsibility to do good to that person as your Christian brother or sister. Paul says in Colossians 3:13, “Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.” This includes a former boyfriend or girlfriend, especially if yours is the broken heart.
Freedom of Information request by the New Statesman to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) reveals that the largest landowners received millions of pounds in taxpayer subsidy last year. The Duke of Westminster, a multibillionaire, was paid £748,716 for his ownership of Grosvenor Farms, the Earl of Plymouth £675,085, the Duke of Buccleuch £260,273, the Duke of Devonshire £251,729 and the Duke of Atholl £231,188 for his Blair Castle estate. It was also a lucrative year for the Windsors. The Queen received £415,817 for the Royal Farms and £314,811 for the Duchy of Lancaster, while Prince Charles was paid £127,868 for the Duchy of Cornwall. Similarly well-remunerated was Saudi Arabia's Prince Bandar bin Sultan, who received £273,905 for his 2,000-acre Glympton Estate in Oxfordshire, allegedly purchased with proceeds of the 1985 al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia. The largest individual UK beneficiary is Sir Richard Sutton, who was paid £1.7m for his Settled Estates, the 6,500-acre property near Newbury that he inherited with his baron­etcy in 1981, despite net assets of £136.5m.
This one is associated with the postal service in that no one is getting their news from paper anymore. To see someone reading a newspaper in their homes is becoming a thing of the past. So many newspapers that were once giants are now either going out of business or stopping print and switching to online news with ads. This means that you won't see that grade schooler tossing papers from his basket bike no more. Hipsters playing Paperboy on NES a few decades from now won't even know what a paperboy was. This is a job that will disappear entirely in the new few years.

In Led Zeppelin's concert film The Song Remains the Same, "No Quarter" was the thematic music behind Jones' personal fantasy sequence, in which he played a haunting masked horseman or highwayman roaming the graveyards. Jimmy Page also used a short segment of theremin as an added sound effect while playing the song live, as can additionally be seen in the movie.
Decades of overfishing and the international demand for cheap seafood mean Thai boats are increasingly turning to slave labor as fishermen flee worsening working conditions, a rights group said on Wednesday. Thai waters are one of the world's most over-fished regions, and Thai boats now catch just 14 percent of what they caught in the mid-1960s, according to the London-based Environment Justice Foundation. To remain profitable, boats are forced to stay at sea for longer and go further afield than ever before. Some unregistered "pirate" boats are fishing the waters of other countries, also fueling demand for modern-day slaves, the EJF said in a report. As workers flee appalling conditions aboard the boats, catches decline and costs rise, vessel operators have resorted to using trafficked, bonded and forced labor to fill the shortfall and man their fishing boats, the EJF said. "Producers and consumers of Thai seafood are embroiled in one of the most outrageous social and ecological crimes of the 21st century," EJF executive director Steve Trent said in a statement. "Ecosystem decline and slavery exist in a vicious cycle," he added. Thailand is the third largest seafood exporter in the world, with exports valued at $7 billion in 2013, EJF said.
"Batman fanboys are the worst! They think he's invincible" That's only some. Not all, I know batman is mortal, but batman's definitely damn near above humanity. IMO, I consider him a semi-superhuman because he definitely isn't a super-human but he is waaaay too good to be considered just "a human". Ever heard of the Bruce Lee saying *"I wouldn't be worried about the man who's practiced 10,000 kicks, I'd be worried about the man who's practiced 1 kick 10,000 times"*?In other words, it's saying Quality doesn't equal Quantity. Well, batman's practiced 1 kick over 10,000 times (he mastered it..) and practiced 10,000 kicks(an exaggeration to say he's mastered many many many kicks), he's got Quantity and Quality. What would Bruce say to that? Ever heard the saying "Brains beats Brawn"? Batman's got both. The hell do you expect when someone like batman is going against someone like Capt. America who has *mostly* brawn?
Previous play ends. Coordinator decides what the call is, then radios it into the quarterback. The QB then huddles everyone up and gives the play call to the other offensive players.

Bono easily won the seven-way race with 4,842 votes, while accountant Lloyd Maryanov was second with 2,498, city spokeswoman Julie Baumer said. Businesswoman Deyna Hodges had 1,934 votes and Vice Mayor Eli Birer, 1,140. Three other active candidates trailed far behind.
Bono, 53, rose to fame as the furry-vested, bell-bottomed former hippie singing ″I've Got You Babe″ with Cher, who he correctly had predicted would win the Best Actress Oscar on Monday.
That did it for the day in the runs column. Senior Vince Bruno got the hosts lone hit of the day in the bottom half of the third on a single up the middle, but he was quickly erased on a double play by the next batter. Fry allowed the next Cal baserunner in the fifth when third baseman Lucas Erceg was hit by a pitch. It was unable to get anything going, however, as the next two batters both made outs.

Since Jim took charge at the New Lawn – which had just been built a short distance from their previous ground – there have been many changes at the Gloucestershire club. Belying the reality that Nailsworth – where the club is based – is a tiny place, Forest Green defied predictions of their demise even as a Conference club year after year before current Chairman Dale Vince took-over in 2010. He oversaw a revolution at the club both on and off the field. The owner of an `environmentally friendly' power company and described as `Britain's Richest Hippy' by some business websites, Chairman Vince implemented new policies at the club including the gradual withdrawal of all meat-based and then dairy-derived products not only from his players' diets but also from the catering throughout the ground.
As I stuffed my face and wet my whistle, I got talking to another Forest Green Steward (note the bars between me and her. Animals in a pen? Surely not…) This was a female one and when I mentioned that I would not be all alone if it were possible to actually sit down as an Away supporter, she became quite indignant. If I had taken the trouble to ring the club in advance, space would have been made in the main stand for anyone with mobility difficulties. “And how would I know that as an Away supporter?” Face the East and go “Om!” preferably from Stonehenge? No – don't be silly. “This is the fault of your club: they should have published this information in advance!” “I've no reason to believe that Morecambe didn't publish all the information they were sent by your club” I said, “But there's no mention of it there. Your lot told us to come prepared for bad weather!” She was not happy about this and said she would be `raising this issue' with the Forest Green hierarchy – and I'm sure she will. In fact, she was very friendly and gave me this lovely smile to share with you all:
The Browns use three principle schemes to get their run game going: inside zone, outside zone, and power.

As a clinical psychologist, I can tell you that there are many people who are already way out of touch with their emotions. And they struggle with this, even without Botox. With less awareness of negative emotions, people are missing an important inner signal that flags when something is upsetting - to themselves or others. Imagine being that much less in touch with your feelings after your boyfriend leaves you. Socially, imagine not being able to relate to a friend as she grieves over the death of a . If our ability to be empathic is impaired, so, too, is the ability to form healthy, supportive . The long-term implications could include unhappiness, distress, or a gnawing feeling that something is terribly wrong - even if those feelings exist only below the surface of a superficially "happy" person's wrinkle-free face.
Twenty-nine players – three goalies, eight defensemen and 18 forwards – will first take the ice on Saturday afternoon for a 60-minute workout that is open to fans at no charge.
• Dakota Mermis won't dazzle anybody during the drills at camp but he likely will stand out in the games vs. LA. The Coyotes signed the undrafted defenseman after watching him defend Connor McDavid in the OHL playoff series between Erie and Oshawa last season.
• The Coyotes have invited left-handed defenseman Keith Aulie, 26, to attend the main training camp on a PTO (Professional Tryout). Aulie has played 167 NHL games for Toronto, Tampa Bay and, most recently, Edmonton.
• The Coyotes also have invited right-handed defenseman Corey Potter, 31, to attend training camp on a PTO. Potter has played 129 NHL games for the New York Rangers, Pittsburgh, Edmonton, Boston and, most recently, Calgary.
• Defenseman Dylan Reese will be sidelined for four to six months due to an injury he suffered while training this off-season. Forward Jordan Szwarz also suffered an off-season injury while training and he may miss the first few skates at training camp.
Torchetti and Minnesota management held off on shipping out players, but they opted to send forward Brady Brassart and defenseman Guillaume Gelinas to the ECHL last week. Forward Matt Carey was sent to the ECHL on Dec. 3 and has remained there.
Statistically speaking: Texas Stars captain Travis Morin passed William Nylander of the Toronto Marlies for the AHL scoring lead. Morin has 35 points (10 goals and 25 assists) in 36 games. … Petr Straka of the Lehigh Valley Phantoms still holds the AHL goal-scoring lead at 17 goals. … Ontario Reign veteran Peter Budaj's 1.68 GAA tops all AHL goaltenders. He has started 14 consecutive games and is tied with Michael Leighton (Rockford) with a league-high 16 wins. … Wilkes-Barre/Scranton goaltender Matthew Murray, who returned to the AHL this past week, leads the league in save percentage at .940. … Toronto defenseman TJ Brennan has 13 goals and 18 points in 31 games, most among AHL defensemen.
Around the AHL: Providence center Alexander Khokhlachev was named CCM/AHL Player of the Week for the period ending this past Sunday. He had three goals and three assists in two games. … The league announced its coaches for the 2016 Toyota AHL All-Star Classic that will be hosted by the Syracuse Crunch on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. Wilkes-Barre/Scranton associate coach Jay Leach will coach the Atlantic Division. Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe will coach the North Division. In the Western Conference, Dean Evason of Milwaukee will represent the Central Division. Ontario's Mike Stothers will lead the Pacific Division. … Six AHL players won the Spengler Cup for Canada this past week in Davos, Switzerland. Defensemen Trevor Carrick (Charlotte), Mark Cundari (San Jose Barracuda) and Aaron Johnson (Stockton Heat) played on the Canadian blue line. Veteran forwards Manny Malhotra (Lake Erie) and Daniel Paille (Rockford) also participated. Charlotte goaltender Drew MacIntyre was injured early in the tournament. … Grand Rapids has won 17 of its past 19 games. … Charlotte has a 10-game point streak (8-0-1-1). In the middle of a six-game road trip, the Checkers' 12 road wins are the second-most in the AHL. … The Binghamton Senators' five-game winning streak ended this past Saturday at Hershey when they surrendered a 5-1 lead and lost 6-5 in overtime. They have points in their past six games (5-0-1-0) but remain last in the North Division. … Four more AHL players made their NHL debut this past week, bringing the season total to 73.
The Pokémon prefers to remain hidden amongst snow and ice before attacking, being surprisingly capable of lurching from hidden places as various ice and water based Pokémon enter its home. Kyurem is a known man-eater and unlike many Pokémon has no particular preference to what it eats; it simply depends on what can run faster.
Does a 3 million loss in the popular vote erase a mandate for Trump? or create one for Hillary if she had won? No. Whether you like it or not our electoral system does not run like that. No Senator or Congressman has that constituency. They are only answerable to the portion of the popular vote that actually vote for or against them. At this point it is worth noting that not even the most rabid believer in the popular vote and the abolition of the electoral college is calling for the voters in California to be able to decide the Senator of Iowa or Florida. If President Trump were to go to California and claim that he had a mandate there and Senator Harris had to support him, he would be wrong. If President Trump were to go to West Virginia and tell Senator Manchin that he had a mandate there because he won by 40 points he would have a very good case. More important than the technical definition of the mandate is that the people involved believe that Trump has it. A couple of weeks ago during the flag burning controversy multiple people on the right and left condemned Trump, yet Senator Manchin said that while he thought it was still legal he would punch a flag burner in the face.
SEATTLE – A 21-year-old University of Washington student was charged with first-degree murder on Wednesday after prosecutors said he beat and strangled his girlfriend during a bad acid trip.
Expecting any group of offensive linemen to remain healthy for an entire season is probably an exercise in folly, but it might be even more wishful given the age, injury history, or both, of each of the four already entrenched on the line.
While talented, the Rams are almost entirely unproven at the offensive skill positions. Bradford is the elder statesman of the group, and he's entering just his fourth season in the league. Compounding matters is an offensive line that takes on the complete opposite look from the skill positions with a group of mostly older players who have dealt with various injury issues in recent seasons. The defense will return eight starters but has some questions on the back end at safety. Taking the next step to compete in a treacherous NFC West against a difficult schedule will require big progress for young players at running back and receiver and a fair amount of luck in terms of health on the offensive line.
Jay Ratliff was released by the Dallas Cowboys last week amid injury troubles. However, the free-agent defensive lineman should be ready to return to the field soon after undergoing sports hernia surgery.
State GOP Chairman J.R. Romano blasted Lawlor's initial smear of Trump voters as “scary.”
Woods, Simmons, and Townsend Jr. were the most experienced defensive lineman on the USC roster. They have all since graduated, leaving the Trojans with some huge question marks on the defensive line.
The defensive line is the biggest question mark coming into the season. The doom and gloom seems to be a bit overstated, as Utah graduate transfer Stevie Tu'ikolovatu is stepping up while converted offensive lineman Khaliel Rodgers and junior college transfer Josh Fatu should have a huge role in the two-deep rotation.
Determined to keep Washington Democrats at arm's length, Taylor penned a letter to DSCC Chairman Micheal Bennet (D-Colo.) in June asking the committee not to help him. Taylor's campaign says he is not been encouraged by the DSCC to end his campaign. And he's shown no signs he's ready to pack it in.
A former UFC heavyweight is being accused of kneeing his girlfriend in the head, dragging her by the hair, and threatening to kill her 10-year-old son, per a police report obtained Tuesday by MMA Fighting.
East's girlfriend told Bernalillo County (N.M.) Sheriff deputies that she locked East out of their home after an argument that lasted all day because she feared he would hit her. East broke in through the window, cornered her in the bathroom, kicked her multiple time to both legs, kneed her in the head and slapped her in the chin, the alleged victim said. East also kicked a hole in the wall when he missed her, she said.
East then grabbed her by the hair and pulled her toward the front door, his girlfriend told police. He told her she was going to leave with him or he was going to kill her son, she said.
East told cops that he and his girlfriend were just going out for coffee. He said he did not know why she was not wearing pants, socks or shoes. East said the two were in an argument and he broke back into the house after she locked him out, because it was his home. He said the hole in the bathroom wall was there before that day.
Per the report, East also told officers that he was unaware that his girlfriend was injured and if he “had punched her” deputies would know it.
The relegation battle was desperate at times. At the director's behest the whole side went on pilgrimage to the statue of the Virgin of Chamorro, in the Holy City to ask for help, but to no avail. Ferrol ended the season relegated from the Segunda División. Like a true journeyman Méndez moved on to another Segunda División side, Terrassa, neighbours to giants Barcelona. Sadly they were also relegated at the end of his first season. This was a pattern which would become familiar throughout his career.
But what of Méndez? Surely such a journeyman of the Regionalliga knows these situations well. A journeyman moves on, just as Alberto has done every season since reappearing in the German game in 2004. After six relegations in eight years something was different this time around.

The likelihood is that Ferguson meant nothing other than to be nice, so even idle joking about an ulterior will doubtless draw frothing accusations of cynicism. And fair enough. Why CAN'T I hear Sir Alex Ferguson or José Mourinho say anything and not take it simply as the face-value verdict of one guileless everyman on another?
But, another infield spot appeared to open up for the Cubs who started third baseman Kris Bryant in left field during Tuesday's game at Miami.
Also comparable to the behaviour of a church has been the Broccolis' obsession with remaining contemporary without sacrificing core meaning. Sometimes you get the feeling that they are relying on poorly informed younger daughters of cameramen for their tips (A-ha doing the opening song for The Living Daylights) but there is a Lampedusan wish to preserve the past through change, which means that the films have become now a sort of library of the new and the potentially new. You had to be there (as I was, aged 10) for the moment in Live and Let Die when Bond, lying in a darkened room, glances at his watch – and it shows an LCD face! For some, a thrilling harbinger of the future, but for a thousand Swiss watchmakers an ask-not-for-whom-the-alarm-beeps flash of horror. Hovercraft, sideburns, cars manufactured by Sunbeam, safari-jackets, waterbeds filled with tropical fish, jet-packs – these have all come and gone. A fast-forward through Sean Connery's films alone would encapsulate all male fashion, from the tailored, pantherine figure of the early 60s to the frankly squalid lecher of 1971 in a freakish, short pink tie. Broccoli panic at new movie trends led to low-self-esteem attempts to sway in the direction of Shaft (Live and Let Die), Star Wars (Moonraker) and Die Hard (Licence to Kill). No doubt the Daniel Craig films, which are too close to see in perspective, hold inside them elements that will become embarrassingly characterisitc of their era. The uninvolving scenes of computer hacking may, for instance, provoke laughter in the 2020s.
The nature of Bond's relations with women has changed little over the years, as laughable attempts at sensitivity or female feistiness go all the way back to the 1960s, most nakedly in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) where Tiffany Case's character in the space of only two hours actually mutates, from hardboiled wisecracking gangster at the beginning to bikini-clad simpleton at the end, as though the sheer pressure of audience expectation simply breaks her down. The character of Sylvia Trench, who features in the first two films, Dr No and From Russia With Love, is meant to be Bond's regular London girlfriend (a sexual counterpart to Miss Moneypenny). As played by Eunice Gayson, she seems to link Bond to cheap British movies of the 50s, starring such people as Dirk Bogarde and James Robertson Justice, with her heaped-up hair, punting and indoor golf. But the character was then dropped – suddenly she just isn't there any more, as she passes the baton on to the demented blondes of Goldfinger and the 60s really begin.
Justice authorities in western Germany are facing a barrage of criticism after a convicted rapist and murderer killed his girlfriend during a conjugal visit at a prison on Sunday.
NEW YORK—Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen and three former Fed leaders sought to dispel worries the U.S. is heading back toward recession despite concerns about slow global growth and the expansion's advancing age. Ms. Yellen, joined Thursday in an unusual gathering in New York by former Fed Chairmen Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker, described an economy that is progressing without breeding obvious new financial bubbles that could derail growth. “This is an economy on a solid course, not a bubble economy,” Ms. Yellen said. It has made “tremendous progress” from the damage of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The Habs traded away their 1st and 2nd round picks in exchange for Arizona's 1st round selection and Buffalo's 4th round position. They also gave up their 3rd round pick, the remaining balance due for acquiring Mathieu Schneider in 2008-09. In hindsight, trading away draft picks for an aging defenseman to bolster a suspect team which barely made the playoffs before getting unceremoniously swept out of the first round was questionable asset management. The team had also traded away their 6th round selection for the right to draft Petteri Simila with the final selection of the 2009 draft.
The 2010 draft should always be evaluated solely on the progression of Tinordi. It seems unfair, but Montreal moved up in the first round for the right to draft this big rugged defenseman whose presence could enhance the entire roster. They were so set on him that they traded their first and second round selections to Arizona. Basically, Pierre Gauthier put all his chips in the middle of the table with this move.
It is too early to label Tinordi a bust. Few defensemen from his draft year have broken out. Those who have all benefitted from playing for bottom-dwelling franchises that were forced to fast-track their prospects into the NHL. Defensemen require more seasoning, especially oversized ones. These truths have conspired with Montreal's depth and competiveness the last few seasons to keep him on the outside looking in.
Just four selections after MacMillan, Montreal went into their backyard to grab Ellis out of Cape Breton. At the time, he was advertised as one of the more solid all-around defensemen available in the QMJHL.
Ellis may benefit from roster moves in 2015-16. Greg Pateryn played big minutes with Montreal down the stretch and his contract converts to a one-way deal next season. Magnus Nygren signed a contract with Farjestad in the SHL. With these two right-handed defensemen off the depth chart, Ellis may benefit from the opportunity to play without the looming threat of a benching on the other side of every turnover.
And there's nothing like a Michael Bay movie to make servicemen swell with pride, civilians think about enlisting and rival despots quake in their boots. “Recruiting and deterrence are secondary goals, but they're certainly there,” concedes Capt. Bryon McGarry, deputy director of the Air Force's public affairs office.
The production, however, doesn't pay location fees or military personnel salaries though servicemen can take time off to serve as extras — a plus since they know how to carry a gun, wear a uniform and follow orders.

Against Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals Crosby and his merry men were all stymied. Case and point: defenseman Paul Martin assisted on every Penguins goal in the series, all two of them. To be fair to Crosby (Batman) his trusty sidekick Evgeni Malkin (Robin) was also shutout in the series, but for some reason most of the fingers have been pointed at number 87. Malkin was also unproductive, but there are fewer people calling him out as my former mentor mentioned.

Let's tally the numbers: three hit batsmen and the three failed attempts by the Padres to hit Perez led to the benches clearing in the second, fifth, eighth, and nine innings. Thirteen players and both managers—yes, even the Braves' saintly manager, Joe Torre—were ejected. Five fans who joined the fun were arrested. Eleven players and both managers were fined. Four players received suspensions. Torre was suspended for three games. Padres manager Dick Williams was fined $10,000 and given a 10-day suspension. It all resulted in an extremely coy box score and play-by-play description.

Mr. Lee - A gentleman who took a liking toward Evans. He helped him to get a job when first getting to the city and watched his life unfold from a distance. While on his death bed, Lee called for Evans to come see him and told him that he had left his fortune to him. Like his late wife, Evans was a drunkard but Evans did not let it take him to his grave. Mr. Lee felt that when Evans came to the city he should have watched over him as a father would and since he failed to do so he wanted to make up for his neglect.
Whitman Drunk - Readers today often find Franklin Evans very unsatisfactory due to the fact that it was originally published in newspapers, Michael Warner states. When Whitman is talking about alcohol in Franklin Evans, he often seems to be thinking about something else. Most of the time, the idea of pleasure seems to be stuck in his brain. For example, he writes "Oh, fatal pleasure", not "Oh, fatal alcohol". Whitman seems to make a great correlation between will and desire in his novel. Warner states that the temperance movement was one of a non-state society and Franklin Evans helped to mediate constitutive self-understanding. Commissioning fiction as propaganda had been a part of the public strategy of the temperance movement since 1836, and Whitman went along with this idea. Because of this, both the temperance movement and Franklin Evans are in a context of non-state political association. Warner argues that hardly any bad situations follow directly after the consumption of alcohol in the plot of the story. The disasters of marriage, impulse, and a creole slave turning into a homicidal madwoman do not have to do with alcohol. Alcohol had so little to do with the story that Whitman had to change the title twice. The theme of the novel seems to be addiction, not alcoholism. It is not hard to hear some reference to the same-sex subculture of New York City in many passages. When talking about drunk men, Whitman focuses on the description of the men, not the alcohol they have consumed. This idea of sexuality is the main focus of many of Whitman's poems, too.

This month, the husband-and-wife team, along with artist Bret Blevins, will put Harley — and some girlfriends — on the open road in Roadtrip Special #1, out Wednesday from DC Comics. “When they ask us to do these specials and we come up with an idea, the basics of it are: ‘what else are we going to learn about Harley?' It can't just be a simple story. We have to learn something about her,” Palmiotti explains to EW. “So we sort of bookended the idea of her family and younger life with a lot of madness thrown in the middle of it. It's funny, because with Harley, the cool thing is you can kind of do stuff like this — it doesn't always have to be Harley Quinn and Batman and Joker kind of stuff. I think the fun that we have is we get to take her out of the normal situations and really get to know her.”
So far, the world has gotten to know Harley through unlikely relationships (looking at you, Bruce Wayne) and surprisingly compassionate father-daughter advice. So what makes this special different? “Catwoman is in it, which we haven't addressed yet in any of our stories,” Conner says with a laugh. “We get to see Harley and her two girlfriends just go out and it's sort of like a girls night out, except it lasts for like, a week.”
BALTIMORE, Md. (July 25, 2017) – James Madison, which returns 14 starters from last year's 14-1 squad that captured the 2016 NCAA FCS National Championship, was the overwhelming choice to capture the CAA Football title in 2017 according to a vote of the league's head coaches and media relations directors.

“‘We started to file lawsuits and in the meantime our enquiries continued” said Kuryakos Ergün, the Chairman of Mor Gabriel Monastery Foundation. Ergün said they would appeal to the court for the cancellation of nearly 30 title deed registries.
In Chongqing -- one of the country's so-called "Three Furnaces” known for their steamy climes -- motorists amused themselves by constructing snowmen on the roofs of their cars. The artistic outpouring prompted a backlash from police who stopped scores of such frostily adorned cars, worried they might hamper visibility and cause car accidents. Residents in southern Guangdong province, meanwhile, made the most of their snowfall by fashioning miniature snowmen with heads crowned in leaf sprigs.
On his decision to speak about his sexuality via YouTube, the sportsman explained: "I didn't want to get my words twisted. I wanted to put an end to all the rumours, the speculation [and] just say it."
While we don't yet know what Ramsay will do to hunt down his bride next season, I certainly didn't have a life-saving escape in mind when I made the move to end my relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend not because I consciously realized who he really was, but because I couldn't be in a relationship anymore. Maybe I was more alert than I give myself credit for, but all I remember from the time is that I couldn't stand to be touched by him, that I wanted to be alone, and that I didn't want the responsibility of a relationship because I simply wasn't ready for it. I was tired of him, and whatever love I had for him wasn't enough.
So Democrats may be inching closer to the type of economic message that vexed them last year, have capitalized on backlash to health care, and appear to be making opposition to the GOP tax plan a salient issue. There is still plenty of resentment lingering among supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders after the bruising presidential primary — hauled back into the open as of late with former interim Democratic National Committee Chairman Donna Brazile's book, which dredged up many of those 2016 wounds. They were able to unite in Virginia, but that will be tested as the cycle goes on.
The night after Iowa has been spent on cable news mostly interviewing candidates about their results there, and probing them on problematic issues. Piers Morgan opened his program tonight with a chat with Rep. Ron Paul, in which he asked the candidate to assess his performance and challenged him on his weaknesses. He also brought up a gaffe from earlier in the week– a mocking tweet at Jon Huntsman Rep. Paul claimed not to know about, and scolded Rep. Paul for being uninformed about it– as Huntsman himself looked on.

Morgan then turned to the tweet in question, asking Rep. Paul whether he had any comment: “Do you want to apologize?” Rep. Paul responded by saying that “it was supposed to be a little high-spirited and funny, but it turned out to be a national incident,” and that it was his staff that thought it was a good idea. As he began explaining what happened, unbeknowst to him, Huntsman himself appeared on the screen waiting for his interview, listening to Rep. Paul. Morgan eventually let Rep. Paul know that Huntsman was on the line, as the Congressman continued to explain. “I thought he was a nice guy he had some nice ideas!” Rep. Paul explained.
Morgan then gave the Congressman a bit of unsolicited advice: “I would urge a little caution… [there now is] a pattern of you being completely unaware of what your staff are doing half the time.” Rep. Paul responded that it wasn't “half the time,” and that “it was meant to be in good humor,” though he told his staff that it “isn't very funny” for them to do something that causes the candidate to be caught flat-footed on national television. On the other screen, Jon Huntsman smiled.
The second thing I noticed was that Sankey (and really all the Titans backs) tend to run better on zone runs. I don't think the technique is there with pulls. We're not blowing guys off blocks consistently when blocking down, and our pulling linemen continually appear to struggle. Still, this line has some athleticism to it that can shine at times when working laterally in the zone game. As it relates to Sankey, the zone game gives him the leeway to use his vision and ability to change direction, both of which are strengths. Instead of attacking a predetermined hole, often times of which is not correctly blocked, the zone game affords him the potential to cut things back with the playside blocking breaks down.
NRA TV's Grant Stinchfield took Watts to task, saying, “Was it just a tantrum when you attacked Kimberly Corban – a rape survivor who wants to carry a firearm to protect herself? And where was your tantrum when Sheenan Allen was thrown in jail for carrying a legally registered handgun into New Jersey… And Ray Rice – who beat his girlfriend – got off with a wrist slap.”
Since late January, I've had the privilege of teaching the introductory International Politics class at Haverford College just outside of Philadelphia. One of the benefits of teaching bright undergraduates (mainly freshmen and sophomores) is that they come to the study of international relations from such a different perspective than my own that classroom interactions are often interesting and thought-provoking. The other major benefit is the opportunity that it has provided for me to go back and re-read some international relations classics.
The White Sox acquired third baseman Matt Davidson from the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for closer Addison Reed. Davidson, 22, appeared in just 31 games (18 starts at third base) this past season with the Diamondbacks but put up impressive numbers in Triple-A.
Defensively, Davidson is still considered to be a work in progress, but had progressed under former Diamondbacks coach Matt Williams, a former major league third baseman himself.

Scott reunites Ruth with her boyfriend John Blake (Russell Hardie), who has stowed away. Then the train is suddenly stopped until the wreck of a circus train on the tracks is cleared.
Death and Everyman 2019
In December of 1948, the Cavemen won the state football championship after defeating Jefferson High School 6-0. During the return trip, the chartered bus transporting the team went off the side of the road, resulting in the deaths of two athletes: Sterling Heater and Al Newman. Because the trophy was badly damaged during the accident, the OSAA offered to replace it with a new trophy in exchange for the old, damaged one. However, the team refused to give up the trophy, and the OSAA eventually allowed the school to keep both trophies.
In the 2014 football season, the Cavemen went 9-0 during the regular season en route to becoming the undefeated SW Conference Champions. During that season, the Cavemen put up over 50 points on four occasions, over 70 points twice during the regular season, and over 70 once again in the playoffs. The season ended with a loss in the third round of the playoffs to West Salem.

Although the No Limit Soldiers, named such after Master P's No Limit Records, were packaged as a face stable, complete with a rallying cry of "Hoody Hoo", they failed to connect with the mostly Southern WCW audience. Master P was first introduced during a press conference on WCW Monday Nitro on June 14, 1999. In his only other televised appearance, on Nitro the following week, he and the Soldiers (including Brad Armstrong, renamed "BA") bullied heel wrestler Curt Hennig by rejecting a present he gave to Master P's brother Silkk The Shocker—a custom-made cowboy hat—with Silkk stomping on it and Master P then assaulting Hennig with a birthday cake. This created confusion among fans as Hennig was a heel who was being bullied by a group of people promoted by WCW as faces. He was reportedly paid $200,000 per appearance by Eric Bischoff for his short participation in WCW.
ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ (commonly known as Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs or simply Psalm 69) is the fifth studio album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released on July 14, 1992, by Sire Records. It was produced by frontman Al Jourgensen and bassist Paul Barker, and was recorded from March 1991 to May 1992 in Chicago, Illinois and Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The album's title, initially intended to be The Tapes of Wrath, ended up being derived from Aleister Crowley's The Book of Lies.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, throughout Denmark the practice of music was under the monopoly of the appointed city musicians (stadsmusikant), who with their journeymen and apprentices were the only musicians allowed to play for a salary within an assigned territory. Since the city musician was trained in the cities, this meant that courtly repertoires made their way into the countryside, and that most areas did not maintain local musical traditions during this time. Only a few areas, such as Bornholm and Amager, never had the stadsmusikant monopoly, and a few others such as Fanø maintained a local tradition by an arrangement whereby local musicians leased the right to perform on the island from the city musician of Ribe. Since city musicians frowned on the use of instruments deemed impure such as drums, bagpipes and hurdy-gurdies, this period also saw the rise of the fiddle as the main instrument for dance music.

Both Aquitaine and Septimania were still out of central Frankish control after Charles's death, but Pepin the Short was determined to subdue southern Gaul. In 759, after conquering Septimania from the Umayyad, the Carolingian king focused all his might in crushing Aquitanian resistance to central Frankish power. After a ruthless war of 8 years, Aquitainian independence came to an end. Toulouse was now under the grip of the new Carolingian king Charlemagne and access to Andalusian Hispania was open for him, despite sporadic rebellions in Vasconia during the next two decades (Basques subdued in 790 by Charlemagne's new loyal strongman in Toulouse William of Gellone).
An ordinary seaman (OS) is a member of the deck department of a ship. The position is an apprenticeship to become an able seaman, and has been for centuries. In modern times, an OS is required to work on a ship for a specific amount of time, gaining what is referred to as "sea time". For centuries, the term ordinary seaman was used to refer to a seaman with between one and two years' experience at sea, who showed enough seamanship to be so rated by their captain. Historically in some navies and the merchant marine a sailor with less experience was called a landsman.
During the apprenticeship, an OS performs a variety of duties concerned with the operation and upkeep of deck department areas and equipment. These duties vary with the type of ship, the type of voyage, the number of crewmembers, the weather, the supervisor, and any number of other variables. However, in most cases, one can expect an ordinary seaman to clean, to perform maintenance, to work with deck equipment, and to undergo on-the-job-training under the supervision of senior deck department members.
The next step on the career ladder for the ordinary seaman is to become an able seaman. This advancement is based on a number of factors laid out in the Code of Federal Regulations.
The Code of Federal Regulations establishes in 46 CFR 12.05 four categories of able seaman for the United States Merchant Marine:

The island was named by Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno, who sighted the island on 4 December 1602, the feast day dedicated to Saint Barbara. The U.S. National Geodetic Survey surveyed the island in the 1850s. Squatting fishermen and seal hunters occupied the island, including H. Bay Webster near Webster Point, until the federal government leased the island to J.G. Howland in July 1909 for a period of five years. Alvin Hyder assumed the next five-year lease. From 1916 onwards, the island was occupied by the Hyder brothers, Alvin, Clarence and Cleve, with their families. They raised sheep until departing the island in 1922. The only other individuals to lease the island, before it became part of the national monument in 1938, were by Arthur McLelland and Harry Cupit from 1929 to 1932.
In 2006, Long Island continued its Democratic trend. Helped by a strong Democratic win nationwide, Democrats Eliot Spitzer and Hillary Clinton won Long Island in a landslide in the Governor and US Senate race. Democratic Comptroller Alan Hevesi, despite being scandal-ridden, won Long Island and Democrat Andrew Cuomo won all of the island's counties in the Attorney General race, with Republican Jeanine Pirro narrowly losing in Suffolk. Republican Peter T. King held on to his Congressional seat in a race against Nassau County Legislator Dave Mejias by a 56%-44% margin, even as two other New York Republican Congressmen lost their seats upstate and one open Republican seat flipped to the Democrats.

Blum was born in Long Beach, California and grew up in Rancho Santa Margarita, California. During his major junior career with the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League (WHL), Blum helped the club to a President's Cup as WHL champions in 2006 and a Memorial Cup as Canadian Hockey League (CHL) champions in 2007. He received the Bill Hunter Memorial Trophy as the WHL's top defenseman and the CHL Defenceman of the Year Award in 2009. In his final season with the Giants, he established himself as the franchise's all-time assists leader.
After being sent back to junior from the Predators' training camp in September 2007, Blum was signed to an entry-level contract with Nashville on December 17, 2007. Earlier that month, on December 2, he set a Giants' franchise record with four assists in a 6–1 win over Portland Winter Hawks. One of the Giants' alternate captains along with forward Garet Hunt, he finished the season with career-highs of 18 goals and 63 points, finishing second among league defensemen (behind Ty Wishart's 67 points in 72 games). His offensive production also set a single-season franchise-record among Giants defensemen for goals (surpassed by Kevin Connauton in 2009–10) and points (surpassed by Brent Regner in 2008–09). At the end of the season, he was named to the WHL West Second All-Star Team, along with teammate Tyson Sexsmith.
Blum returned to complete the season with 66 points in just 51 games to finish third in league scoring among defensemen behind teammate Brent Regner and Paul Postma of the Calgary Hitmen.

He was later chosen as the CHL Defenceman of the Year over Dmitri Kulikov of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) and Ryan Ellis of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), who were both chosen as defensemen of the year in their respective leagues. In addition to his league-wide honors, he was named co-team MVP with Casey Pierro-Zabotel, as well as the Giants' Top defenseman and Most Sportsmanlike Player.

The Giants' post-season ended in the semi-finals against the Kelowna Rockets. Blum led the team in playoff scoring with 18 points in 17 games.
He remained with Milwaukee in the AHL the following season and scored his first professional goal on October 14, 2009, against Hannu Toivonen in a 5–2 win against the Peoria Rivermen.

In Kwun Tong District, a budget proposal for repainting of 10 wall paintings for 0.8 million was approved in September 2016. Some of the wall paintings were painted in 1983. In 2010, 0.6 million was spent on organising a wall painting competition for the repainting work. According to Chairman of Kwun Tong District Facilities Management Committee Tam Siu-cheuk, the original design will remain after the repainting. The budget was reasonable in terms of the cost of weeding, cleaning and maintenance. Also, according to Kwun Tong District Councillor Wong Tsz Kin, the alternative of redesigning is not likely because the removal of the existing wall painting is technically difficult. Home Affairs Department replied the wall paintings will make the environment more pleasant and raise hygienic awareness.

Young reached the Majors briefly in 2000, playing 2nd and getting two at-bats. He hit .249 in 106 games as a second baseman in 2001. In 2002, Young placed second in fielding among second basemen with a .988 fielding percentage. In 2003, Young was 3rd in the league in hits with 204, and led all second baseman with a batting average of .306. Young had a fielding percentage of .987.
After signing a new contract, Young moved to shortstop, filling the hole left by the departure of regular Ranger's shortstop Alex Rodriguez in 2004, to make room for newly acquired second baseman Alfonso Soriano. He was second in the American League in hits with 216 and at bats with 690, fourth in runs with 114, and ninth in batting with an average of .313. He spent 89 games hitting in the leadoff spot, the last time in his career that he hit leadoff prior to 2013.
During the 2010–11 offseason, Young said that the Rangers had "misled and manipulated" him and requested a trade. The Rangers, having acquired free agent third baseman Adrián Beltré, planned to have Young be the team's primary designated hitter as well as a utility infielder, and see time at first base for the first time in his career. He was a 2011 American League All Star.
Young agreed to waive his no-trade clause and on December 9, 2012, was traded to the Phillies in exchange for pitcher Josh Lindblom and minor league pitcher Lisalverto Bonilla. The deal reunited him with former teammates Laynce Nix, Cliff Lee and Mike Adams. The Phillies were monitoring Young for some time prior to his acquisition. Their former Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt said, "we got a Derek Jeter kind of player on our team all of a sudden ... He's two or three Michael Young years away from being a Hall of Famer, first ballot maybe." Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. and manager Charlie Manuel also were fond of Young and made him a target headed into the Winter Meetings. Once they agreed to a deal, Young had to approve it, which he did, later mentioning that he would only have done so to go to a winning team like the Phillies. The Phillies viewed Young as a stop-gap to get them to top prospect Cody Asche.

Volume III (1954), English historian Steven Runciman noted that between 22 and 30 August, as Richard's army marched from Acre past Haifa to Jaffa, Saracen light horsemen carried out various assaults on the crusaders and took several prisoners 'who were taken to Saladin, cross-questioned and then slain, in vengeance for the massacre at Acre. Only the washerwomen were spared.'

The contrast between African time and Western time is illustrated in the award-winning short film Binta and the Great Idea. The protagonist of the film, a fisherman in a small village in Senegal, can't understand the new ideas brought back from Europe by his friend; these are symbolized by a Swiss wristwatch, which rings at various times to the delight of the friend, but for no apparent reason. The fisherman is shown making his way through the various ranks of officials with his idea, which in the end is a sharp criticism of Western culture's obsession with efficiency and progress.

In 1944, Republican secretary of state Mart Christensen died while in office. Governor Hunt appointed longtime State Auditor William M. Jack as Christensen's replacement. Jack declined to run for re-election or for any other office, creating an open seat. Earl R. Burns, the Chairman of the Wyoming Public Service Commission, won the Democratic nomination unopposed and advanced to the general election against Arthur G. Crane, the former President of the University of Wyoming. The general election was not close, and Crane was elected secretary of state over Burns by a landslide. During Crane's term, Governor Hunt would be elected to the U.S. Senate, and Crane would serve as both acting governor and secretary of state.
Following the death of Secretary of State Mart T. Christensen, Democratic state auditor William M. Jack was appointed as his replacement by governor, who, in turn, appointed Carl Robinson as Jack's successor. In 1945, Robinson resigned from office and Governor Hunt appointed former Congressman John J. McIntyre as his replacement. McIntyre opted to run for Congress rather than seek re-election, and no other Democratic candidates filed for the election. In early July, however, Major Alvin C. Wade of the United States Army announced a write-in campaign, and won enough votes to receive the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Copenhaver defeated Wade by a decisive margin.

This had resulted from a suit by Wiley Bolden with the support the Non-Partisan Voters League in the late 1970s, challenging the at-large election of city commissioners, which was filed under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It challenged the at-large system for suppressing minority voters, and reached the United States Supreme Court, which decided Mobile v.

Bromberg which seemed a "smoking gun".

Samuel Rowley's 1604 play When You See Me You Know Me depicts the childhood of the future Edward VI. When he skips class to play tennis, Edward "Ned" Browne is sent to the chapel to be whipped by the master of children. Cranmer says, "Since he was whipped thus for the prince's faults. / His grace hath got more knowledge in a month. / Than he attained in a year before, / For still the fearful boy, to save his breech, / Doth hourly haunt him, wheresoe'er he goes." The prince persuades king Henry VIII to knight Ned: "the poor gentleman was pitifully wounded in the back parts, as may appear by the scar, if his knightship would but untruss there". Ned hopes the tutors will refrain from whipping a knight, to which the fool retorts, "If they do, he shall make thee a lord, and then they dare not." This work may have helped the idea of a whipping boy to take root.
Alan Oakley's archive was sold in 2018 (Mellor & Kirk Auctioneers, Nottingham, August 2018) and reveals valuable insight into this debate that until 2018 had not been seen in public. The archive reveals that the Design Council did not consult Raleigh before citing Tom Karen as designer of the Chopper and the Design Museum merely acknowledge Karen as the designer of the 'product'. The Oakley archive contains an account from the then Managing Director and Chairman of Raleigh that reveals the reasoning for Raleigh sending their chief designer to America for a three week fact-finding mission, it describes the trip, the 'envelope sketch' and the months following the trip. It describes the market's need for the Chopper and the strategy for going to market.

According to Yaqut's 13th-century geographical encyclopedia Mu'jam Al-Buldan, Manfuha was built a few centuries before Islam at the same time as Hajr (now Riyadh)<ref>Yaqut Al-Hamawi, "Yamamah", "Hajr", "Al-'Irdh", "Al-'Allaqi", and "Qurran" in Mu'jam Al-Buldan</ref> by members of the Banu Hanifa tribe and their cousins from the tribe of Bakr. Manfuha was home to the famous Arab poet Al-A'sha, who died at around the same time as the Muslim prophet Muhammad, but little is heard of Manfuha after that time. At the turn of the 20th century, its population was made up largely of members of Banu Hanifa and Bakr (who by now had come to identify themselves with the related tribe of 'Anizzah), as well as members of Tamim and Subay'. Like all Nejdi towns, its population also included a large percentage of non-tribally-affiliated tradesmen (sonnaa'''), as well as many slaves and freedmen working as agricultural labourers. Like Riyadh, the town was surrounded by gardens and palm groves.

Each of the vignettes is preceded by a title such as "Father as Role Model", "A Family Torn Apart" or "Patriarchal Supremacy Restored". These vignettes cover such issues as losing a child in a department store, the relationships between father and son, or husband and wife, the wisdom of age, meeting one's first girlfriend and many more. Each is presented with humour, presenting a very believable picture of family life which crosses cultural boundaries. The relationships between Matsuko, Takashi and Shige are particularly well observed, with Shige giving advice and proverbs to all the family members, and having a great strength of character. Takashi and Matsuko's relationship is often the focus of the episodes, their rivalries, such as arguing about who has control of the television, their frustrations and their difficulties, but the overriding theme is their love for one another despite their flaws, and their desire to be the best parents possible for their children.

Taiwan's overseas fishing fleet has been criticized for a history of abuse and a lack of protection for migrant laborers, often from Southeast Asia. Official Taiwanese sources put the number of foreign workers aboard Taiwanese vessels at 26,000 but NGOs and US government agencies put the figure around 160,000. Foreign fishermen frequently report non-payment, long work hours, and verbal and physical abuse at the hands of their captains and officers, who are often Taiwanese. In recent years Taiwan has made significant progress on the issue, but abuse remains widespread. In terms of human rights the distant waters fishing fleet lags far behind the rest of Taiwanese industry.

By contrast, Jason Heller of The A.V. Club perceived a lack of "joy" in the band's "garage-rock angle", writing that they "feel like they're writing a paper on the genre rather than celebrating it in song." Phil Mongredien of The Observer called the album "oddly leaden and largely witless", and criticized the band for "flailing ever further from the pop nous that has underscored their finest moments". Barry Nicolson of NME found ¡Dos! "too cluttered with filler to measure up against the best of the band's stuff." Slant Magazine's Jonathan Keefe wrote similarly, "only a handful of its tracks are truly essential additions to the Green Day catalogue." Mark Roche of State felt that it "has as many disappointing tracks as it does impressive ones" and observed from Green Day "the attempt to forge modern expectations with old school sensibility, even if it doesn't always work." Sputnikmusic's Joseph Viney felt that "Armstrong's lyrics are the biggest hindrance" and called the songs musically "limp". Jon Young of Spin felt that Armstrong "might want to abandon" his "juvenile posturing ... even the most seductive rascals lose their boyish allure eventually." Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly stated "scratch the party-till-you-puke surface and there's plenty of minor-key darkness lurking below, as in the bleary-eyed "Lazy Bones" and the lounge- lizard groove propping up "Nightlife.""

The Girlfriend (1988)
Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Martyn Parsons (1 November 1910 – 7 June 1998) was a British Army marksman who played an important role developing and testing small arms and ammunition during the Second World War, and whose performance in post-war rifle competitions established him as one of the finest rifle marksmen in Britain.
Parsons was commissioned in 1929 into the Royal Ulster Rifles, and went on in 1932 to become the Northern Ireland rifle champion. His prowess as a marksman made him a candidate for additional training, and he was sent in 1938 to a Long Small Arms technical course at the Ministry College of Science, where he became one of the first infantry officers to be awarded a technical qualification. This resulted in his being assigned during the war to rifle testing trials and small arms development for the War Office and Ministry of Defence. He was also posted to the Ordnance Department. He spent two years at the end of the war in Washington, D.C., and then was reassigned to the War Office, before being given the command in 1949 of his regimental depot.
It was in post-war rifle competitions where Parsons' marksman abilities became legendary. Shooting in 1949 and 1950 for his regimental team in National Rifle Association (NRA) competitions at the National Shooting Centre in Bisley, Surrey, he won the King's Medal (the highest honour) both years in a row, which made him the champion shot in the British Isles. He also won in 1949 the NRA Service Rifle Championships, the Queen Mary Cup and the Wantage Cup, the latter being the first time anyone had won the cup with a perfect shooting score. He eventually shot every year until 1959 with his regimental team at the Bisley competition.
His marksmanship was also unsurpassed in the Army Operational Shooting Competition at Bisley. He won the Bronze Jewell award there at the 1947, 1954 and 1955 competitions, and in 1951 he won the Silver Jewell as well. He ultimately shot in the Army competitions for 11 consecutive years (except 1953), and his name appears on every individual Rifle Championship Cup save one in the Army Rifle Association.

Leo Faller "Deed" Harris (June 6, 1876 – May 28, 1961) was an American sportsman who coached, scouted, and refereed football, baseball, and basketball. In 1917, he was the last coach of the Carlisle Indians football team. J.S. Steckbeck states that the team was forced to travel far off the Carlisle Barracks campus for practice because of a measles epidemic, lost practice time, and the result was that the team closed the season with 2 wins and 7 loses. In reality, the poor season was likely the inexperienced and young players. Pop Warner visited Carlisle in September of 1917 to help prepare the squad and commented "not to expect great things from the team" and a "great football team cannot be developed in one season."
The Second Battle of Katwa occurred between the Bengal and Maratha Empire in December 1745. After the defeats of the Marathas in the first four invasions of Bengal (see Maratha invasions of Bengal), the Maratha General and ruler of Nagpur, Raghuji Bhonsle again invaded the territory of Bengal. Bhonsle, with 20,000 horsemen attacked the civilians of Murshidabad and moved onwards to Katwa. However he was repeatedly ambushed by peasant guerillas and militias in Birbhum and near Durgapur, and thus his column was thinned considerably. The Marathas met Alivardi Khan's army in Katwa where the battle started. During the battle, most of the Marathas were slaughtered and the remaining Maratha soldiers under Raghuji Bhonsle retreated from Katwa. The Marathas then retreated towards Medinipur. The battle was a victory for Alivardi Khan who had once again ousted the Marathas from East Bengal. After this battle, Alivardi Khan was known in Bengal as "Maratha-khuni" which translates to "Maratha-killer" in Bengali.

Talha Jubair became the youngest player to participate in Cricket World Cup. Sri Lanka's clinical demolition of Canada for 36 runs created a new World Cup record for the lowest innings score, a dubious distinction that was, at the time, the lowest score in ODI history. Records tumbled when defending champions Australia took on minnows Namibia, with Glenn McGrath claiming the World Cup's best bowling figures (7/15), a performance that helped Australia defeat Namibia by 256 runs. Team-mate Adam Gilchrist created a new wicket-keeping dismissal record in the same match, with 6. Against Namibia, Indian players Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly recorded the second highest partnership in World Cup cricket (244 runs). India and Australia clashed in a one-sided battle in the final, with Australia creating multiple records (the highest World Cup final score, the highest score by a captain in a World Cup final – Ricky Ponting, most sixes by a batsman – Ponting) in a match; with Australia winning by 125 runs. Tendulkar's 673 runs, the most runs scored in a single World Cup history to date, was the consolation for India as he won the 2003 Cricket World Cup Man of the Series award. The World Cup also saw fielding records in an innings (Mohammad Kaif) and tournament (Ponting). The World Cup broke the record for most sixes in the tournament (with 266), but this was easily surpassed in the 2007 edition (with 373).

They were to elect churchwardens out of their own number. The "officiating minister for the time being" (there is no word as to his appointment, which was still in the hands of Government) was to preside at all meetings of the vestry. The vestry took over all powers and possessions of the church committee, and was made a corporation capable of suing and being sued. In 1841 the meaning of the words "holding, communion" was queried, and the Attorney-General decided that they did not mean what they said, but that any one professing to be a churchman was a full member of the Church. Governors and colonial chaplains and landdrosts obtaining communion vessels and Royal Engineers (they inspected the building of the church) and pew-rents and church ordinances and secretaries of state for war-it is a queer, mad sort of story

Robert Burks was born in Chino California on July 4, 1909. Aged nineteen, he found work as a special effects technician in the Warner Brother's Lab, the industry's largest special effects facility at the time.

Another important Hitchcock collaborator, screenwriter John Michael Hayes, stated that Burks "gave Hitchcock marvelous ideas [and] contributed greatly to every picture [he shot] during those years."
The Isle of Man in the British Isles is famous for the queen scallop, or "Manx queenie" as it is known locally. Due to the vagaries of landings over the years, Manx fishermen have worked on technical conservation regulations, in order to ensure that stocks of the queenie have remained robust. These have included restrictions on fishing times, closed seasons, and limitations on the number of dredges permitted. There are also two conservation areas in the island's territorial waters; one has been in place since 1989 and the other was created in 2008; these areas are closed to mobile fishing. These conservation areas are supported by the fishing industry; the fishermen themselves started the initiative to create the Douglas closed area. Data analysis appears to support the viability of these areas, which appear to help ensure that the Manx queenie can be fished sustainably.

Rushaway's back-to-back wins in a two-day period was and remains a most noteworthy achievement which the Daily Racing Form (DRF) reported was "a feat without known precedent in this country or abroad." The accomplishment was made even more remarkable because Rushaway was carrying top weight in the eight-horse field by three pounds yet won by 6 lengths and did it in a new race record time for the mile-and-a-quarter distance. The DRF pointed out that while many had their concerns about the wisdom of racing the horse in such a manner, everyone agreed that Alfred Tarn was an astute horseman and someone they held in high esteem. Rushaway's victory in Latonia marked his third Derby win of the year.

In 1971 it was discovered the workmen in the other Belgian plants had a much higher salary for similar work. The workers in Balen wanted a raise. This led to a dispute between the workmen, the trade unions and the directors board. The 1500 workmen in Balen went on strike, but this was not accepted by the trade unions. As a result, the workmen were not paid. The strike went on for 9 weeks. Many charities were set up by inhabitants of Mol and Balen. Jef Sleeckx, a politician, convinced the banks to cancel payments temporarily for affected workmen. Landlords did not ask rent during the strike. All kind of shops gave food for free or gave the impacted workmen a temporary job. At the end, the directors board agreed and the workmen even got a higher wage than requested.

A church has been on the site since before the Norman conquest, but the fabric of the present church dates from the 12th century. Windows and the tower were added in the 15th century. The church was built to serve the bargemen working on the River Thames; there was a quay alongside the church but there are now no remains of this. It was a chapel of ease to St Peter's Church, Burnham. An attempt to make it into a separate parish in 1737 failed because sufficient endowment could not be raised. Probably in the middle of the 19th century, a dado of bricks was added to the exterior in an attempt to keep out damp, and in 1897 the window tracery was replaced.

The Police Support Unit had its origins in 1898 when 150 Ngoni tribesmen were recruited by the British South Africa Company as auxiliary native police to the British South Africa Police in Company-ruled Rhodesia. For most of their existence, they were mostly relegated to ceremonial duties, leading to them being given the derogatory nickname of the "Chocolate Soldiers" by the white policemen. It was suggested in 1963 by the British South Africa Police (BSAP) commissioner following the breakup of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland that the Police Support Unit should be expanded to take on the role of the Rhodesian Army in Southern Rhodesia. But this suggestion was rejected by the Southern Rhodesian government. However, when the Rhodesian Bush War started, the Support Unit took on a more active anti-terrorist role.

During the Special Period in the 1990s, many Frikis purposely contracted AIDS in an attempt to escape the effects of the economic crisis by entering state-run AIDS clinics, referred to as sanatoriums. One of the first to do so was a Friki called Papo la Bala. La Bala injected himself with the infected blood of an HIV-positive rocker and converted to Christianity on his deathbed. According to Nolan Moore, a writer for ListVerse, "hundreds of teens" followed in la Balas example. Although no official statistics exist of the numbers of infected Frikis, the University of Pennsylvania have stated that "many estimates that approximately 200 people–mostly men–had infected themselves" and that "not realizing it spread through sexual contact, many of their girlfriends also suffered from the consequences of their actions". In a 2017 documentary by Vice Media, a Friki called Yoandra Cardoso said that "When the sanatorium first opened, it was 100% Frikis."

Casey Brienza, Carlo Santos, Carl Kimlinger and Theron Martin at Anime News Network (ANN) reviewed the first episode as part of a "fall 2008 anime preview guide". Brienza called the series "thoroughly enthralling" when at its best, and said that its imagery of death and destruction would be intriguing to viewers interested in apocalypse-themed works. She found the opening and ending themes "bright but boring", and noted that they were at odds with the story. Santos, too, disliked the ending theme, combined with Takumi being an otaku with an imaginary girlfriend, saying that despite being "tongue-in-cheek" it felt too overt and annoying: he felt that Takumi's growing paranoia, the music and the art direction of the graphically violent scenes worked well to set the tone, but that the "fluff" involving Takumi's imaginary girlfriend and his sister disrupted the mood. Kimlinger also noted the inconsistent tone, and called the female characters "painfully artificial". He was not opposed to the combination of the themes of "otaku alienation" and horror, but called the series' horror mystery an uninteresting mix of Higurashi When They Cry and Japanese psychological horror films. Martin called the series a contender for "weirdest" anime of the season, and also compared the tone to that of Higurashi When They Cry. He liked the visuals and music, calling the latter "eerie" and effective.

Tigerlily's Orchids was well received by critics. Sue Gaisford of The Independent wrote in a positive reviews: "Ruth Rendell, grande dame of the thriller, knows how to spring surprises. Rendell inexorably accelerates the pace from tortoise to hare, and with wisdom, compassion and satisfactorily sardonic wit." Publishers Weekly wrote of the book: "Rendell's spare, sleek novel of psychological suspense gets off to a slow start, then picks up speed to become vintage Rendell, not the powerhouse of the 1990s but with enough plot petrol to blow most American authors out of the water ... as always, Rendell spices the action with just the right gothic ingredients to keep things baroque but consistently believable." Writing for The Guardian, Laura Wilson summarized the book as a "thoughtful, slow-paced and immensely readable novel ... about the effect that crimes, both small and large, have on the community." Another positive review came from Steve Donoghue of The Washington Post, who praised the novel's characters, writing: "Rendel presents us with [the characters] in all the scrupulous, almost forensic detail for which she's famous. We get the aggressively supercilious building superintendent, the trio of flighty young girls, the brainless middle-aged married couple, the reserved elderly gentleman — all rendered perfectly, with the throwaway ease of a practiced master."

Clemson and FSU first played in 1970, predating Florida State's membership in the ACC. The actual rivalry started to emerge in 1988 when the No. 3 Clemson Tigers hosted the No. 10 Seminoles in a "clash of styles" marked by FSU's highly touted skill talent and passing attack, versus Clemson's well regarded option, linemen and linebackers, that was ultimately decided by Leroy Butler's 78-yard "puntrooskie" run, costing Clemson the victory and dashing their national title hopes. Clemson avenged the loss in 1989, dominating the trenches, with a 34–23 victory in Tallahassee, marked by a 73-yard scoring run by Terry Allen and a 73-yard interception return by Wayne Simmons. The Seminoles and Tigers finished the 1989 season with 10–2 records, and ranked No. 3 and No. 12 in the final AP poll, respectively. The series also marked the only two games coached by Danny Ford and Bobby Bowden, who were the 3rd and 9th ranked coaches in winning percentage in college football at the time.

The Kid is the talented but troubled frontman of his Minneapolis-based band, The Revolution. To escape his difficult home life—his father verbally and physically abuses him and his mother—he spends his days rehearsing and his nights performing at the First Avenue nightclub. The Revolution, the flashy Morris Day and his group The Time, and Dez Dickerson and his group The Modernaires hold the nightclub's three house band slots. Morris, aware that The Revolution's guitarist Wendy and keyboardist Lisa are frustrated that The Kid is unwilling to play their compositions, lobbies Billy Sparks, the club's owner, to replace The Revolution with a girl group which Morris is already forming.
He targets the Kid's girlfriend Apollonia—an aspiring singer and new arrival in Minneapolis—to lead his group, and tries to persuade her that The Kid is too self-centered to help her.

The tower was built in 1898 on land that belonged at the time to the locally prominent Keney family. Its construction was done by the family under the terms of the will of Henry Keney, who sought to memorialize his wholesale grocery business, H. & W. Keney. The family, however, instead placed a plaque on the tower reading "This tower erected to the memory of my mother is designed to preserve from other occupancy the ground sacred to me as her home and to stand in perpetual honor to the wisdom, goodness and womanly nobility of her to whose guidance I owe my success in life and its chief joy ~ Henry Keney". The tower was designed by New York City architect Charles C. Haight, whose specialty was Collegiate Gothic architecture. The family trust deeded the tower and park to the city in 1924.

Able seaman is a military rank used in naval forces.
In 1653 the Royal Navy introduced a new pay scale as part of reforms following defeat in the Battle of Dungeness the previous year. Included in these reforms were, for the first time, separate pay scales for more experienced seamen that distinguished between an ordinary seaman and an able seaman. The higher ranked able seaman was required to be competent in steering, use the lead and working aloft, and received about 25% higher pay than an ordinary seaman.
In the middle of the 18th century the term "able seaman" (abbreviated AB) referred to a seaman with more than two years experience at sea and considered "well acquainted with his duty". Seamen with less experience are referred to as landsmen (for the first year at sea) or ordinary seamen (for the second).
In time of war (such as the Seven Years' War or the Napoleonic Wars), with many more warships in service, the navy, merchant marine, and privateers competed ferociously for the limited pool of able seamen, leading to the unpopular use of impressment by the Royal Navy to keep its ships manned. In peacetime, with fewer active warships, there was usually a surplus of unemployed able seamen willing to work in the navy. As late as the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy's practice of stopping American ships to press American sailors into involuntary service was one of the main factors leading to the War of 1812 with the United States.
In the Royal Canadian Navy, Sailor Second Class (previously Able Seaman until August 2020) is the second-lowest of the non-commissioned member ranks, ranking above Sailor Third Class and below Sailor First Class. Sailors Second Class wear a single gold chevron, point down, as an insignia of rank; it is worn on the upper part of both sleeves of the service dress tunic, and on slip-ons on both shoulders on other uniforms.
In the Royal Australian Navy, able seaman (AB) is the second-lowest of the non-commissioned member ranks, ranking above seaman and below leading seaman.
Able seaman is the equivalent rank to Leading aircraftman, in the Royal Australian Air Force and Private Proficient in the Australian Army. It is not equivalent to Lance Corporal which is rated as E4, not E3 like the ranks of Able Seaman and Leading Aircraftsman.
Able Seamen with additional skills are denoted by modifications to the "AB" rank; for example photography skills which are acknowledged in the title Able Seaman Imagery Specialist, or ABIS.

In practice, compliance with the Law on Access to Information remains weak just as its implementation which is not supported by the full authority of the bodies responsible for its enforcement. The Ombudsman in Moldova has the authority to supervise the implementation of the law, but this office lacks the capacity and the resources to exercise its role. Investigative journalists and civil society organisations face numerous difficulties when requesting access to public information, including obstruction by public officials, refusals and delays in replying to requests, as well as incomplete responses to requests for information. To justify their denials, public officials frequently cite laws that conflict with the Law on Access to Information, in particular the Law on State Secrets and the Law on Trade Secrets.
Although the idea was birthed in the western Adelaide suburb of Cowandilla in the 1930s, which led to an 11 team Electric Light Cricket competition there in the 1930s, it is believed that the first match played under floodlights in England was on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to "Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down, but they can't promise." The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times were not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: "What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?"

Deiectum vel effusum – throwing objects or pouring liquids out of a building. Actio de deiectis vel effusis permitted persons harmed by such objects or liquids to seek compensation from the person inhabiting the housing from which the object (or liquid) was thrown. Personal involvement in the act itself was not required of the offender, separating this from the above mentioned actio legis Aquiliae. If a freeman died as a result of deiectum vel effusum, any citizen could bring forward an actio de deiectis vel effusis, making this a "popular action" (actio popularis). In practice, only family members were usually permitted to bring the actio forward, however.

The period between 1645 and 1649 saw the Kandyan adopting a scorched earth policy in eastern Sri Lanka.

Governing through puppet presidents has long been a political tactic in Latin America. Many dictators and strongmen have formally handed over power to other officials for several reasons, often in order to follow constitutional provisions for elections and term limits, to provide a civilian façade for military rule, or to be able to go into semi-retirement away from the capital city. Strongmen who sometimes governed through figureheads included Diego Portales of Chile, Rafael Núñez of Colombia, Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez of Costa Rica, Fulgencio Batista of Cuba, Ulises Heureaux and Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Gabriel García Moreno of Ecuador, Raoul Cédras of Haiti, Porfirio Díaz and Plutarco Elías Calles of Mexico, the Somoza family of Nicaragua, José Antonio Remón Cantera, Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega of Panama, Dési Bouterse of Suriname, and Antonio Guzmán Blanco and Juan Vicente Gómez of Venezuela. While figureheads who decided to act autonomously were often dismissed, on rare occasions the "puppets" later became significant political figures in their own right. For example, Lázaro Cárdenas turned against and exiled Calles to the United States and Joaquín Balaguer was elected to the Dominican presidency six times after the assassination of Trujillo.

Commercial Street is a street downtown Portland, Maine. In 2008, it was named one of the ten best streets in the United States by the American Planning Association. It was built upon old piers in the 1850s. Fill was pushed into Casco Bay to accommodate the growing railroad and warehousing needs of the port's working waterfront. In the 1970s and 1980s, much of the economic activity on the street was hurt and many of the properties on the street were sold off for non-marine development, including the building of condominiums. In 1987, Portland voters, led by local fisherman based on Commercial Street, halted all non-marine development along the street and adjacent docks. Marine development around Commercial Street returned in the 1990s and 2000s (decade) alongside other economic development, including tourism-related industries.
Blacksmiths were the first local craftsmen to unite into a guild, which was given royal privileges in 1436. They smelted their own ore, or built water-driven forges along the rivers Hornád and Dubnica. Coppersmiths made kettles of a specifically defined weight because kettles were widely used as a means of payment. There were charcoal burners and even resin pickers who collected resin from trees to produce tar for greasing wagons. There were wheelwrights, coopers, weavers, joiners, gunsmiths, basketmakers, bakers, furriers, tanners, cooks and millers, hunters, fishermen and beekeepers.

The punishment inflicted by Ptolemy Keraunos on the Getae, however, induced the Triballi to sue for peace. About 279 BC, a host of Gauls (Scordisci) under Cerethrius defeated the Triballi with an army of 3,000 horsemen and 15,000 foot soldiers. The defeat pushed the Triballi further to the east. Nevertheless, they continued to cause trouble to the Roman governors of Macedonia for fifty years (135 BC–84 BC).

Born in Sydney, Mahoney played as a batsman and occasional wicket-keeper for Wellington from 1902–03 to 1911–12. After top-scoring with 40 not out in a Wellington total of 140 against Lord Hawke's XI in 1902–03, he was selected to play in both the matches New Zealand played against Lord Hawke's XI. In the second match he scored 27 (the second-top score) and 24 (top score) in an innings defeat.
Against Canterbury in 1906–07 Mahoney hit his highest score so far when he made 63 not out, the top score in the match, in the second innings. He was again selected for both of New Zealand's matches later that season, against the touring MCC side. In the first match, batting at number six, he scored 71 not out, adding 82 with the last two batsmen to take New Zealand's total to 207. His 214 runs at an average of 42.80 made him one of the leading batsmen of the season.
According to Dan Reese, who played with him in three of his matches for New Zealand, Mahoney was a stubborn batsman and "was a little deaf and took a lot of watching in running singles, or the last run from a hit to the outfield".
Dr. Henry Clay Moses (18 August 1941 – 16 April 2008) was an American educator. A teacher, college administrator, and school headmaster, he instituted important changes while the dean of freshmen at Harvard College and helped to lead Trinity School into its third century. A dedicated outdoorsman, he enjoyed running, cycling, backpacking, and mountain climbing.
Moses was the dean of freshmen at Harvard College from 1977 to 1991. There he was responsible for the academic and residential welfare of 1600 freshmen. He served as a member of faculty committees on admissions and financial aid, expository writing, advising and counseling, housing, and undergraduate life, Phillips Brooks House, and the administrative board of Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges. "Hank was a superb Harvard colleague: wise, funny, respectful of tradition but able to think out of the box, courageous, and kind," recalls the current Harvard College Dean of Freshmen Tom Dingman. "His analytical ability was sharp as was his capacity to understand and relate to students and faculty. During his tenure here he built a very strong staff and started programs like the Freshman Outdoor Program that have become critical to our success. Trinity's gain was our loss. Now we all will miss him."
As a lecturer in American literature at Harvard University (1980–1984), Moses taught a survey course in American literature, lectured on Mark Twain and Henry James, and created and taught an upperclassmen course on William Faulkner.
At Freshmen Orientation he asked the ninth grade students to write what they hoped to have accomplished by the time they had graduated from Trinity. At the Senior Retreat he asked the graduating twelfth graders to write about their experiences at the School and to describe their impressions of the place. He treasured these notes from the beginning and end of each student's time in the Upper School and he pored over them to find inspiration to improve the work of the School. He sought to strengthen the students' connection to Trinity Church, Wall Street—where the School was founded in 1709—by establishing events at the church: a matriculation event for the freshmen and a baccalaureate for the graduating seniors. Throughout his tenure at the School he sought to connect to every member of the community and to enhance their lives by reaching out to the larger world.

De Bray was born in Amsterdam, but established himself in Haarlem before 1617, where he is registered as being a member of the schutterij that year in the St. Adrian's cloveniers. He probably followed draftsmanship and painting lessons in the small academy started by Karel van Mander, Hendrick Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem, and where he married in 1625. He is registered as a pupil of Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem, but he probably started his training in Amsterdam with Jan Pynas, Nicolaes Moeyaert and Pieter Lastman. He painted history paintings, portraits and landscapes. As a Catholic he probably also made altar pieces for the Haarlem underground Catholic churches known as mission stations, or staties. He was a poet and member of the Chamber of rhetoric called "De Wijngaertranken". One of his poems was set to music by his friend the composer Cornelis Padbrué. This is probably how he met his wife Anna, the sister of the painter Jan and the poet Jacob Westerbaen, who were also members of De Wijngaertrancken. They married in 1625.
In 1630 he became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. He cooperated with fellow guild member and Catholic architect-artist Jacob van Campen in the decoration of Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. His works draw on the spirit of the Dutch classicism beginning at that time, and are comparable with those of his Catholic colleague Pieter de Grebber. De Bray became active as an architect and designer of silverwork, and became headman of the Guild of St. Luke. He prepared a new charter for the guild (that was never ratified) in 1631, that was signed by Pieter de Molijn, Outgert Ariss Akersloot, Willem Claesz Heda, Cornelis Cornelisz, Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen, Floris van Dyck, and Isaak Halinck, respected members of the guild. This charter met with a lot of opposition from the Haarlem council, and was probably rejected for its efforts to promote painting above other guild pursuits such as engraving, woodcarving, tapestry-making, smithwork and pottery. In 1632 he made efforts to retrieve the St. Lucas guild relic that had been stored in the guild altar of the St. Bavochurch. It had been given to a representative of the Catholic church for safekeeping and De Bray felt it should be brought back to Haarlem, but the relic was never found.
An article in the Berlin journal Licht-Bild-Bühne in 1914 called him the 'Napoleon of film' (de:'Napoleon der Filmkunst'), referring to his various technological advances.

In medieval hunting in England and Northern Europe, pursuit of the hart or wild boar involved using a 'limer' or 'lyam hound' (a hound handled on a leash or 'lyam') to trace the animal from its footprints or droppings to where it was browsing or lying up. This became known as 'harbouring' the animal. When this had been done, the huntsman reported back to his lord, who then brought the pack of raches to chase it down on its hot scent when it had been unharboured, 'rowsed' or 'upreared'. Sometimes, pairs of raches were held at strategic points along where the quarry was expected to run, to be uncoupled when the huntsman blew the signal, or when the quarry was seen to come close. The Bloodhound was typically used as a limer, and the raches were normally smaller hounds. A lord's pack would include one or two limers to about 20 or more raches.

Mount Musuan's lack of any visible crater has led to some local skepticism of it being an active volcano. Still, the imagery evoked by its name variant 'Mount Calayo' (Fire Mountain) and the stories told by local Bukidnon tribesmen keeps people wary of the relatively small mountain which doesn't look like a volcano at all.

From the description of the district authority Heidenheim of 1844: "Hamlet with 51 thatched houses. Of the craftsmen, Ochsenberg has two potters, some weavers, and several bricklayers and carpenters who work journeymen in Königsbronn and Itzelberg. The economic conditions of the inhabitants, a very active, honest, but rather rough and coarse people, have improved noticeably by the lively haulage business, in which the transport of salt, peat, wood, iron, etc. is taken in piecework by local farmers."

One is that gluttonous priests were so enthralled by the savory pasta that they ate too quickly and choked themselves. Another explanation involves the "azdora" ("housewife" in the Romagna dialect), who "chokes" the dough strips to make the strozzapreti. The azdora would express rage (perhaps triggered by the misery and difficulties of her life) and curse the local clergy, resulting in pasta that could choke a priest. A third states that wives would customarily make the pasta for churchmen as partial payment for land rents (In Romagna, the Catholic Church had extensive land properties rented to farmers), and their husbands would be angered enough by the venal priests eating their wives' food to wish the priests would choke as they stuffed their mouths with it. The name surely reflects the diffuse anticlericalism of the people of Romagna and Tuscany.

For undisclosed reasons, his family's status dwindled, causing his mother to remarry for financial security. Vega's new stepfather, incensed that his wife only valued him for his money, murdered her right in front of Vega, who killed him in return. The incident warped his mind and caused him to develop a dual personality: suave nobleman by day, sadistic masked murderer by night. Brandishing a three-pronged, razor sharp claw gauntlet, Vega embarked on many murderous rampages, taking great pleasure in mutilating his victims, especially those he perceived as "ugly". The murder of his mother caused him to view "beauty" as a trait of heroism and strength, whereas "ugliness" represented cowardice and evil. Eventually, Vega's insatiable bloodlust and brutal fighting skills caught the attention of criminal leader M. Bison, who accepted the young nobleman into Shadaloo as his personal assassin and one of his three Grand Master bodyguards. Vega accepted Bison's offer purely to improve his own aesthetic senses. His official tag partner in the crossover fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken is Balrog, although they are shown to loathe each other due to their clashing personalities.

Derek Poundstone (born September 28, 1981) is an American former professional strongman athlete from Woodbridge, Connecticut who placed runner-up at the 2008 World's Strongest Man. Derek Poundstone is also a police Sergeant for the Naugatuck, Connecticut Police Department and is the former owner and landlord of an apartment complex and gym.
Poundstone began by competing in powerlifting and progressed to become the Connecticut State Champion. He started competing in strongman after finding an advertisement for a contest on the back of a powerlifting flyer. After earning his Professional Strongman card from the ASC (American Strongman Corporation), Poundstone took two years off competing to enter the Police Academy and become a police officer. He returned to compete in strongman, and placed fifth in the 2006 St. Patrick's Strongman National Qualifier. Poundstone then went on to place 2nd to the current IFSA World Champion Žydrūnas Savickas in the 2006 World Strongman Challenge contest in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Next, Poundstone placed 5th in the 2006 America's Strongest Man contest. This earned him an invitation to the 2006 IFSA World Championships. On October 26, 2006, two weeks before the IFSA World Championships, Poundstone severely injured his lumbar spine during training while attempting a maximum effort deadlift of 366 kg (805 lb). Poundstone had a lumbar disc herniation (L4/5) and a massive spinal cord hemorrhage. Doctors told him that he would never lift again due to the severity of the injury.
Poundstone's return to the strongman competition circuit was the 2007 St. Patrick's Strongman contest in Columbia, South Carolina. Poundstone won by 13.5 points and overcame his deadlifting injury fear by completing a 364 kg (800 lb) deadlift during the competition. This victory qualified Poundstone to compete in the 2007 America's Strongest Man contest, which Poundstone won by a record 30 points. Poundstone also qualified to compete in the 2007 IFSA World Championships in Geumsan, South Korea. Additionally, Poundstone received an invitation from Dr. Terry Todd to compete at the 2008 Arnold Strongman Classic, in Columbus, Ohio.
Poundstone also competed in two Team Strongman contests and a Highland Games/Strongman hybrid contest. First was the USA vs. World team contest put on by Al Thompson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Poundstone and his team (Travis Ortmayer, Van Hatfield, Nick Best, Walt Gogola) pulled out an unprecedented victory against three of the top five European strongmen in the World, (Zydrunas Savickas, Vasyl Virastyuk, and Andrus Murumets). Team USA won the first three events and Team World won the next three events. Team USA won with a victory in the final event, the Atlas Stones. Poundstone's next contest was in Callander, Scotland at the World Highland Games contest. This contest was a Highland Games / Strongman hybrid. Poundstone won the event and set two world records. With Douglas Edmunds present, Poundstone broke Igor Pedan's 9 rep 125 kg (275 lb) Log Clean and Press World Record by powering through 13 reps, with 130 kg (286 lb). Poundstone also broke the current World Champion's, Zydrunas Savickas, 140 kg (308 lb) Block Press World Record by pressing out a 145 kg (319 lb) block.

Packer also studied the effects of a full moon and its correlation to the number of lion attacks. Along with his colleagues, he discovered that the risks of man-eating attacks are highest during the first week after the full moon, which may help explain why there are so many myths about the full moon. They also discovered that people in southern Tanzania are most at risk from man-eating lions in areas where they have to sleep in their fields to protect their crops from nocturnal crop-pests such as bush pigs. The lions stumble upon a novel prey species when they follow the pigs into people's fields.

Following Gen. Hamilton Howze's association with the newly emerging field of post-war Army Aviation after the creation of the Air Force, he immediately drew on his trust in one of his former lieutenants. Cairns, now a Brigadier General, was commanding Base Section, COMZ, in La Rochelle, France of US Army Europe, then under the command of Gen. Anthony McAuliffe, when Gen. Howze called upon him to be the 2nd Commandant of the US Army Aviation School and Commanding General at the new home of Army Aviation: Fort Rucker, Alabama. While there, Cairns became the first to apply cavalry doctrine to the Armed helicopter: "As an old cavalry officer, Cairns possessed a 1936 cavalry manual, and offered it as a possible guide. It turned out to be a perfect aid to selling the concept. 'We knew what we wanted to do, but [Cairns] also knew that it would be more convincing . . . when put in words that old cavalrymen could understand. Therefore, we took the 1936 yellowback cavalry manual and went from horses to tanks to trucks. We took the horse cavalry portion of it, and substituted helicopters for horses, using the same language, the same terminology. It was well received. Older soldiers, I mean two, three and four-star generals, could understand the language of their day, of the late '30s."
One of the most popular poems ever written in Russia, Wait for Me was especially popular with the frontoviks (front-line soldiers) in the Great Patriotic War, as Russians call World War II. Most frontoviks knew Wait for Me by heart, and it was very common for frontoviks to carry a locket with a picture of their wives or girlfriends in it, which a copy of Wait for Me was wrapped around, as a sign of their desire to return to their loved ones and to survive the war. Many soldiers seemed to believe that this would somehow how help them to survive the war, as if declaring their love would protect them and ensure that they would get back home.

However, some of the U.S. aircraft "crashed in flight accidents", in fact, were lost to S-75 missiles. When landing at an airfield in Thailand, one B-52 was heavily damaged by a SAM, rolled off the runway and exploded on mines that had been installed around the airfield for protection from enemy attacks; only one crewman survived. Subsequently, this B-52 was counted as "crashed in flight accidents". According to Dana Drenkowski and Lester W. Grau, the number of U.S. aircraft lost, confirmed by the U.S. is uncorroborated since the U.S. figures are also suspect. If a plane was badly damaged, but managed to land, the USAF did not normally count it as an aerial combat loss, even if it was too damaged to fly again.

Jack Earl (born August 2, 1934, in Uniopolis, Ohio) is an American ceramic artist and former teacher, known for drawing inspiration from his home state of Ohio to create rural pieces “with meticulous craftsmanship and astute details… to where you could smell the air, hear the silence and swat the flies.” Although his works hint at highly personal, intellectual, and narrative themes in an almost unsettling manner, Earl is “a self-described anti-intellectual who shuns the art world." He is known particularly for using his trademark format, the dos-a-dos (translated “back to back”): “This art form is like a book with two stories… the two seemingly incongruent images prompt the viewer to fill in the conceptual gap through poetic speculation.” His work often involves dogs or the character “Bill”, who is said to be a combination of Earl's father-in-law, himself, and others. The titles to his pieces are typically lengthy, stream-of-consciousness narratives that suggest the folk or rural lifestyle. These are intended to add another dimension to the artwork. His work has received a notable response over his decades-long career, especially since he is regarded as “a master at reminding us that within the events we take for granted are moments of never-ending mystery and wonder.” Earl continues to live in Lakeview, Ohio with his wife, Fairlie.

"There was black oil all over the water and I was covered with it," Seaman Heistad wrote. "It got in my eyes so I could hardly see and in my mouth and choked me. But we made it back to the ship. God did it all. We went back and forth 7 times to save the crew. We knew we wouldn't make it back every time, but we did. God has all the glory. The officers and captain waited until the last trip and the ship had nearly disappeared when we got ashore. All the men just about tore us apart they were so happy. Everyone was crying. I was covered with oil all over and they wiped me off with their handkerchiefs. Several of them came with their billfolds and tried to give them to us. All I could say was thank God.

Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) is forced to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, her daughter Cece's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several attempts to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not is with anyone else if she is not going to be with him. Warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) even states that he prefers Ravi to Ryan, despite having never met Ravi and only knowing Ryan (whom he calls Brian) from their brief interaction. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.

This putative elective monarchy is a tradition of the people of Dalkey. The freemen of Dalkey inherited the right to elect this King through the boredom of young bloods in Dublin in 1787.

Pakistan eased into a 2–0 series lead with Nasir Jamshed and Sohail Tanvir playing starring roles in Hyderabad. Batting first, Hamilton Masakadza and Tatenda Taibu, with 81, top scored for Zimbabwe but no other batsman could make a significant contribution, as Tanvir took career-best figures of four for 34, rendering their final score of 238 a modest one, at best. Jamshed, in only his second match, then smashed fifty from 43 balls, before he was eventually run out for 74 to put Zimbabwe on the back foot. They rallied, taking four more wickets, but a circumspect knock of 38 not out from Mohammad Yousuf and a belligerent 43 off 21 balls from Shahid Afridi ensured Pakistan made their target with 22 balls to spare.

My wife said to me, 'Kenneth More is Douglas Bader.' And so he was! He was a good actor, but, looking back, I don't think he was all that versatile and he wasn't physically a very attractive man. He couldn't play love scenes. He was more of a playboy type. He was Douglas Bader! Bader wasn't a technical adviser but I suppose Kenny More modelled himself physically on Bader.

After many months of investigation, the police were able to apprehend the two murderers. They were named as Jon Nödtveidt (aged 22), the frontman of extreme metal band Dissection, and his friend Vlad (aged 20), an Iranian national settled in Sweden. The two men, who confessed to their crime, were eventually sentenced by a court of appeal to ten years of incarceration. Vlad was also a suspect in other murder and assault cases around that time.
The police first suspected the victim's boyfriend. The head cap recovered near the body was his, he had no alibi, and the couple was known for their frequent arguments. After twelve days in custody, the boyfriend was nevertheless released, and he was later cleared of all suspicion.

The town's first documentary mention came in 1159 in an enfeoffment document in which a nobleman named Siegfried von Runkel had his name appear as a witness. It is believed that this Siegfried was the one who built Runkel Castle. In 1191 Siegfried married a countess of Katzenelnbogen. This high noble family forced Dietrich of Runkel to open his castles Runkel and Dehrn. No later than 1230, the castle had a chapel, thereby giving Runkel its first church building. In 1288, after years of family disputes, the Lords of Runkel and those of Westerburg sundered into two lines. In 1440, building work began on the Lahn bridge, but owing to the rift between the Runkels and the Westerburgs, the work took until 1448. In 1447 Count Philipp of Katzenelnbogen was the liege lord.

George is credited as the first true middle linebacker in football history and, inadvertently, the creator of the 4–3 defense. Noting during a 1954 game with the Philadelphia Eagles that his tendency to hit the center right after the snap led to the quarterback passing right over his head, he began to drop back from the line, not only enabling him to intercept and otherwise disrupt several passes from that game forward but also creating the familiar 4–3 setup (four linemen and three linebackers).

According to Baskin, in 1981, when she was 19, she threw a potato at Murdock as he attempted to attack her. She ran out of their home barefoot and met her next husband, Don Lewis, on 50th Street in Tampa. She and Lewis engaged in an affair while both were still married. She became one of Lewis's many girlfriends and substantially grew his wealth by helping him buy and sell real estate in 1984. The pair divorced their respective spouses and subsequently married in 1991.
Baskin had a long-running feud with Joe Exotic, the former owner of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. The feud began in 2009 when Big Cat Rescue volunteers initiated an email protest campaign against shopping malls that hosted Exotic's traveling cub-petting shows, prompting many malls to cancel the events. Faced with a loss of income, Exotic responded with a pattern of harassment against Baskin, culminating in rebranding his shows with unlicensed facsimiles of the Big Cat Rescue name and logo and a false Florida phone number; in response, Baskin pursued legal action, alleging that Exotic's trademark infringement damaged the reputation of her organization. In 2013, a court ordered him to pay Baskin $1 million in damages, leading to his bankruptcy. In 2020, he was convicted of attempting to hire a hitman to kill her. Baskin was grateful about his imprisonment, but stated in a video on the Big Cat Rescue website that other big cat owners had been prosecuted as well.
Baskin gave exclusively to Democratic candidates from 2005 to 2016, but since 2017 a significant majority of her contributions have gone to Republicans. Recent donations to Democrats included 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker and Baskin's home Congresswoman Kathy Castor.
US Naval Academy seamanship textbook by Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce, with Samuel Seabury as a co-author
The only prototype T7 Combat Car (No. W40223) was shipped to Aberdeen Proving Grounds in August 1938 for testing. While it showed good speed and performance, cavalry branch representatives were not significantly impressed. Tests were delayed until 1939, but they were reasonably successful. The vehicle even participated in the First Army maneuvers at Plattsburgh, New York in 1939, where the cavalrymen liked it. However, in October 1939, the cavalry branch formed new requirements for their combat vehicles which specified regular tracked (not combined) suspension. The reason for that decision was that the tracks were already available in reasonable quantity and quality and thus there was no need for the complexity and higher cost associated with convertible vehicles. Furthermore, the heavy machine gun was determined insufficient for the role. The ongoing war in Europe at the time proved that, in order for a vehicle to be successful, it needed a proper cannon. In October 1939, despite its potential, the Mechanized Cavalry Board recommended further development and test of the T7 Combat Car program, and all other such convertible vehicles, be canceled. Thus ended the last wheel-tracked combat vehicle development for the U.S. Army.

Four years after Fetting's death, a young Fettingite elder named William A. Draves from Nucla, Colorado claimed that the same messenger who had appeared to Fetting had begun to appear to him, as well. While the Fettingite organization was initially receptive to these new missives, it ultimately decided to reject them all, leading to a split in the Fettingite organization in 1943. Draves' adherents formed the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, which claims to be the sole legitimate continuance of Fetting's original organization. Draves himself announced a total of 90 messages prior to his death in 1994, which were combined with Fetting's into a book entitled The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel. Fetting's organization publishes its own compendium, simply entitled The Word of the Lord, which contains only Fetting's original 30 messages.

Morris remained Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Swansea County Borough Council. Immediately after the election one Labour Alderman moved a motion protesting against remarks by Field-Marshal Lord Montgomery who had questioned the sanity of people who intended to vote for the Labour Party. Morris argued that as Montgomery "had had the grace to apologise, the committee should have equal grace to accept the apology".
In early 1960 Morris was appointed to the Western Area Board of the British Transport Commission, and announced that he would not stand to try to regain his seat in Parliament. At the end of the year, he was also appointed to the National Assistance Board, and was reappointed for a further term two years later. In January 1965 he was promoted to be Deputy Chairman of the Board. When the National Assistance Board was replaced by the Supplementary Benefits Commission in 1966, Morris retained his position; he was also a member of the council of University College, Swansea.

Renouf's second marriage to Sangster was wild and filled with rich luxuries as the newlyweds travelled the world, partying with wealthy businessmen and women, and other socialites. In 1980, Sangster's horse Beldale Ball won the Melbourne Cup race [12]. Renouf later commented that winning the Cup with Sangster was a momentous day and occasion, one that would be hard to outmatch. However, their romance was short lived as Sangster had numerous affairs with younger women. Most well known was his affair with model and girlfriend of rock star Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall. Renouf was the last to be made aware of the situation and said that it was “devastatingly hurtful”. The couple did try to repair their marriage, but in May 1984 Sangster had another affair with former model Sue Lilley, the then wife of a British shoe millionaire.
Renouf's other passions flourished in the following years, with her love of design and architecture apparent in the six homes she bought, redecorated, and on-sold in the years following 1988. Four of her properties made considerable profits, and Renouf's friend and former Vogue Australia editor, Sheila Scotter, had described her unique style as “horny and blokey”. Renouf's career in fashion took off with clothing brands Just Jeans and Myer, and beauty producer L'Oréal. Her short-lived role in Renouf Corporations saw her knowledge in finance extended to Jesuit Social Services – Marketing, Chairman St. Joan of Arc, and Treasurer of the Inaugural Board of Star of the Sea College.

In 1842, he moved to Milan, where he found employment in the private asylum Villa Antonini (hospice of San Celso), of which in 1847 he was promoted to "assistant director", then beginning his study of mental alienation. He also undertook the practice of general medicine, surgery, and anatomical exercises at the Ospedale Maggiore, collaborating with the new medical journal of Milan, founded by his friend Agostino Bertani and directed by Panizza. He participated in the congresses of Italian scientists. During the 1844 Milan convention, he participated in the Natural and civil news on the Lombardy of Carlo Cattaneo (whose second volume never came out). He wrote his beliefs about the Stabilimenti Pei Pazzi, a matter he previously discussed in the Gazzetta Medica of Milan with the title of Historical notes on the establishments of the madmen in Lombardy. While adhering to the ideals of the "Risorgimento", he did not take part in the Five Days of 1848 in the newly liberated Milan but was still appointed director of the public asylum of the Senavra by the provisional government. In 1849–1850, following the closure of the University of Pavia, he taught human anatomy in the newly created school of medicine, surgery, and pharmacy in the Ospedale Maggiore. In the following summer of 1850, he was sent by the same hospital to visit asylums in Switzerland and other European countries to study their organization and evaluate a reform of the Senavra. His experience as an asylum director convinced him more and more of the need to reorganize Italian asylums, transforming them into real tools for the treatment of insanity and into research and teaching centers for the nascent psychiatry, which still did not find space in universities.

These are blood revenge, referred to as Qisas (قصا, "revenge") and blood money, Diyya (دية, "blood money"/"ransom"). In cases of severe crimes such as murder and rape, blood revenge is the proscribed punishment.

Certain crimes are liable for multiple acts of revenge, for example, the murder of women and children is avenged fourfold. Crimes considered treacherous, such as the murder of a guest, are also avenged fourfold.

The force was sent out by the New Guinea Force via Laloki–Goldie River to cut the enemy line of communications between Menari and Nauro. Consisting mainly of eighteen- and nineteen-year-old militiamen who were barely trained and ill-equipped, Honner Force found it difficult to traverse the muddy tracks and dense jungle, however, by 19 September they had reached the vicinity of Omaramara. The majority of the men were exhausted from the march, and the aerial re-supply that had been planned for them did not eventuate. As such they were unable to move beyond the limits of which ground supply could reach them. As the strategic situation around Kokoda had stabilised by then, it was decided that the force was in no condition to conduct offensive operations and they were subsequently disbanded shortly after with the men returning to their parent units without having seen action.

On 27 August 2008, former Bosnian ambassador in Turkey Hajrudin Somun wrote an editorial discussing Kosovan passports, where he summarised to-date the Bosnian position on Kosovo: "As in many other matters, Bosnia and Herzegovina is deeply divided over Kosovo's independence. The parliament of the Republika Srpska, which covers 49 percent of the country's territory, adopted a special resolution denouncing Kosovo's independence and wide demonstrations have been organized there in protest. Keeping in mind that Serb leaders of that entity have threatened to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and join Serbia as compensation for losing Kosovo, Bosnian collective presidency Chairman Haris Silajdžić said simply that his country is 'unlikely to recognize Kosovo's independence any time soon due to strong objections from its own Serb community.
On 26 September 2008 while attending General Assembly of the United Nations in New York, Bosnian Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdžić said in a Voice of America interview broadcast back to Bosnia in Bosnian language that he supports Kosovo's independence and is opposed to Serbia's request that the International Court of Justice issue an opinion on the legitimacy of Kosovo's independence. Silajdžić spoke in his own name because the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not unanimously adopt a platform which would allow him to speak officially.

In a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, announcing the case closure, Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter J. Kadzik wrote that while "our investigation uncovered substantial evidence of mismanagement, poor judgment, and institutional inertia...Not a single IRS employee reported any allegation, concern or suspicion that the handling of tax-exempt applications—or any other IRS function—was motivated by political bias, discriminatory intent, or corruption." Kadzik wrote "We found no evidence that any IRS official acted based on political, discriminatory, corrupt, or other inappropriate motives that would support a criminal prosecution." Kadzik stated that the investigation specifically absolved Lerner of criminal liability, and determined that Lerner was in fact the first official to recognize a problem and try and correct it.
Reactions to the investigation's conclusions were split along partisan lines. Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said that decision not to prosecute ignored "volumes of evidence in the public record and efforts to obstruct legitimate inquires", and that "giving Lois Lerner a free pass only reinforces the idea that government officials are above the law and that there is no consequence for wrongdoing." Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, said "...I believe the American people have higher expectations for their elected officials, and they want Congress to start doing its job and focusing on issues that matter instead of these ridiculous, partisan, taxpayer-funded attacks." House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte, the recipient of the DOJ letter, said that DOJ's decision was "...disturbing. The American people should be concerned that this kind of politicization continues to go unchecked by this administration and a Justice Department charged with pursuing wrongdoing", and 19 members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee led by the committee's Chairman, Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), filed a resolution to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.

The Meadowbank-Rhodes bridge is one of twelve double lattice girder bridges that survive substantially intact in the NSW railway system. As such it is of exceptional heritage significance as evidence of a short lived but highly popular approach to bridge design in which the spanning girders were reinforced by a lattice of bars, adjusted to suit changing structural forces. This bridge is the largest double track lattice girder bridge to be prefabricated in England for export to Australia and has significant variations on the standardised design. The bridge is one of the most architecturally impressive nineteenth century Australian railway structures. A unity in design, lively detail, skilful use of materials and fine workmanship is displayed by the bridge and its abutments. The Meadowbank-Rhodes bridge is an exceptional piece of early Australian railway engineering.

Berckheyde was born and died in Haarlem. Christened as an infant 6 June 1638, he was the younger brother (by eleven years) and student of the painter Job Adriaenszoon Berckheyde. Golden-age historian Arnold Houbraken claimed that Job had been trained as a bookbinder by his father, and could not discover who taught him to paint. Gerrit in turn learned from his older brother. Job's teacher must have been a Haarlem master, and some claim it was Frans Hals, but Houbraken claimed he travelled as a journeyman between Leiden and Utrecht offering his services as a portrait painter and learned by doing. During the 1650s the two brothers made an extended trip along the Rhine to Germany, stopping off at Cologne, Bonn, Mannheim and finally Heidelberg. The brothers worked in Heidelberg for Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, where they were both awarded a golden medal for their efforts, but were ultimately unable to adapt to court life and so returned to Haarlem, where they shared a house and studio. Gerrit became a member of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke on 27 July 1660. He was followed by the painter Adriaen Oudendijck.

Berckheyde favoured views of monuments on large open squares, rather than giving up clarity for the sake of pictorial effect by painting views along canals as the other great Dutch cityscape painter, Jan van der Heyden, did.

In the Chinese city, now, we see that a large woman carries her four children, attached by their hair to a pole straddled across her shoulders; Buddy turns a corner and sees an older gentleman expand and compress himself vertically in order to read a poster on the side of a building; when the man has left, Buddy goes to read the message, which converts, for our benefit, into English: "Grand Celebration To-day: the 150th Birthday Anniversary of the Sacred Dragon: a beautiful girl will be sacrificed to the Dragon. Come one! Come all!" Leaping from straw hat-to-straw hat of five men arranged from back-to-front in ascending order of height, Buddy manages to see the grand celebration: a baton wielder bounces his belly; a drum, held by two marchers, is host to six tiny people who jump upon it; in addition to trumpeters and tiny men whose hats double as cymbals, the procession happens to include a pianist! One of the masked dancers in the parade is a caricature of Jimmy Durante (a favorite target of Warner Bros. cartoons of the time.)

Yalahow is a relative of Ali Mahdi Muhammad, the interim president of Somalia after the outbreak of the civil war in 1991 and faction leader in northern Mogadishu.

This led to a conflict with these ranchers that broke into open warfare, known as the Owens Valley Indian War. The settlers sent word to the county seat at Visalia for help and William Mayfield led a band of Tulare County militiamen to the aid of the settlers there.

The African people of Haiti derived from various areas, spanning from Senegal to the Congo. Most of which were brought from West Africa, with a considerable number also brought from Central Africa. Some of these groups include those from the former Kongo kingdom (Kongo), (Igbo Benin (Ewe and Yoruba) and Togo land. Others in Haiti were brought from Senegal, Guinea (imported by the Spanish since the sixteenth century and then by the French), Sierra Leone, Windward Coast, Angola, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, and Southeast Africa (such as the Bara tribesmen of Madagascar, who were brought to Haiti in the eighteenth century). Haitian culture is very tied to West African culture, especially that of pre-colonialism Benin, Haitian Vodou mostly has origins from the original West African Vodun of Benin and the French-based Haitian Creole language has influences from several African languages including the Fon language. At the time of the Haitian Revolution war, an event that involved the expulsion of many whites (mostly French) in Haiti, many of the blacks in Haiti were African-born and had no non-African admixture. This was because the average African slave in colonial Haiti had a short life span and France continuously imported thousands of Africans yearly to keep the slave population up, by 1790 there were nearly 600,000 slaves, outnumbering whites about 20 to 1.

Border Patrol agents Bobby Logan and Ernie Wyatt are planting motion sensors in a remote area of the Texas desert when they stumble across what appears to be a decades-old Jeep buried in the sand. Upon excavating the vehicle, they find an intact skeleton in the driver's seat, a toolbox containing $800,000 in unused 10 & 20 dollar bills, and a hunting case containing a scoped sniper rifle with matching ammunition. The skeleton is accompanied by a wallet, containing the driver's license of a Michael J. Curtis from San Antonio, and a slip of paper with two phone numbers on it. Logan speculates that the money is from a bank heist in the early 1960s, and suggests that he and Wyatt take the money for themselves. While Wyatt is reluctant; they both finally agree to put out the jeep's license plate information to the Sheriff's department, and ask their telephone operator girlfriends to check out the two phone numbers.
A local prospector discovers the Jeep burial and site and re-excavates it, summoning the attention of Carson and the US Army who cordon off the area. Logan and Wyatt's girlfriends tell them that the phone numbers are a number in Washington, D.C., and an old, unused number for the Dallas Police Department. They also tell them that the information has been passed onto two fellow Border Patrol agents, Roget and Lambassino. Upon driving to the house of the prospector, they find him murdered and the building burned to the ground. Following the tire tracks leading away from the house, they track down one of their station's Jeeps to a deserted farm, and find the corpses of Roget and Lambassino. Carson and his team subsequently arrive on the scene, intimating to a shocked Logan and Wyatt that the incident will be covered up.
During the 1890s Huch seems to have found work as a small town lawyer less than fulfilling, and he embarked on a parallel career as a writer. His work betrays an underlying pessimism and melancholy, possibly driven by a belief that as a writer he would always be overshadowed by more confident relatives who would leave their own larger footprints on literary history. His first published work involved literary criticism. He found wider prominence with his aphoristic volume "Mehr Goethe" ("More Goethe"), published in 1899, which he described as "a high spirited cavalry charge against the diverse literary nonsenses of modern life". in which he employed his satirical wit to uncover the contradictions in the book business, and to ridicule the fashionable superman archetypes of the time and the accompanying Nietzsche cult. He also railed against the nineteenth century revival of Naturalism and took delight in deriding its manifestations on the theatre stage.

This "coin", while technically an ingot, was still used and unofficially considered currency. It was also the largest ingot produced during the California Gold Rush, weighing almost 2.5 oz. During the gold rush of 1849, the US Treasury department hired private companies to mint coins before they could properly set up a mint. The U.S. Treasury was much more practical and would often mint coins near the location of the precious metals used in the coins, however, this did not always happen overnight. Augustus Humbert, who was originally a watchmaker from NY, took a lifestyle change and moved out to California during the gold rush in 1850. The U.S. Treasury had commissioned him to be an assayer. One of the first necessities was a mint to produce the octagonal ingots. The original mint, to be built, was for Moffat and Company was called the Mount Ophir Mint. This was only a temporary mint before a real branch mint of the treasury could be built and commissioned into service. The ironic part is that despite Moffat and Company producing the $50 Dollar Ingots, they didn't have their mint mark or name stamped on the gold (until the $10 gold coin produced in 1852). These $50 Ingots are very rare and prices can range anywhere from $10,000 and up. Currently, the auction record stands at $14,460,000. Another high profile auction record was made in a 2008 auction by Bowers and Merena. This particular specimen is among the highest known of its variety, professionally graded by NGC, at a grade of MS-65. (The only MS-65 known to exist of its variety) NGC Chairman Mark Salzburg called it "the most memorable coin I have graded all year".

John Washington, for instance, who was related to the Pope family of Popes Creek, Washington testified that in his will of 24 June 1674, Washington's kinsman Richard Cole had left all his Virginia lands to Nicholas Spencer. Washington "declareth that hee hath heard Mr. Richard Cole Deceased declare that hee had made a will, and given his whole estate to younge Mr. Nicholas Spencer and further saith not."

The painting depicts the struggle of Hannibal's soldiers to cross the Maritime Alps in 218BC, opposed by the forces of nature and local tribes. A curving black storm cloud dominates the sky, poised to descend on the soldiers in the valley below, with an orange-yellow Sun attempting to break through the clouds. A white avalanche cascades down the mountain to the right. Hannibal himself is not clearly depicted, but may be riding the elephant just visible in the distance. The large animal is dwarfed by the storm and the landscape, with the sunlit plains of Italy opening up beyond. In the foreground, Salassian tribesmen are fighting Hannibal's rearguard, confrontations that are described in the histories of Polybius and Livy. The painting measures . It contains the first appearance in Turner's work of a swirling oval vortex of wind, rain and cloud, a dynamic composition of contrasting light and dark that will recur in later works, such as his 1842 painting Snow Storm: Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth.

The Western Conference meetings of 1905 led to two significant rule changes. Conference members were not allowed to play more than five games per season. Also, freshmen were now ineligible, and players were allowed a maximum of three years of eligibility. These rule changes were made in response to growing criticism over player injuries and deaths during games at that time.
These changes greatly hampered play in 1906. Conference players who were to be seniors were all ruled ineligible, because they had already played three years of competition. Players who were to be freshmen also sat out. Only players who were to be sophomores and juniors were allowed to play.

First, the quarterback receives the football from the center. The quarterback then starts the play in one direction by appearing to hand the football to the fullback right behind the play side guard on a standard fullback dive play. The guard "chips" the 3-technique (defensive tackle) and blocks the play side (the side where the play is going) inside linebacker (usually called the "mike", or middle linebacker). The quarterback then reads the unblocked defensive lineman. If the lineman attacks the fullback, the quarterback pulls the ball from the fullback's gut and continues down the line, but if the defensive lineman goes outside to contain the play, he hands off inside to the fullback. The offensive tackle on the side of the play's direction does not block the defensive end and instead moves to block the first threat, usually the linebacker stacked behind the defensive end. In the traditional triple option the backside tailback will take a parallel course down the line of scrimmage keeping a three to five yard separation from the quarterback. If the defensive end comes inside toward the quarterback, he will pitch it outside to the trailing halfback. If the defensive end retains outside leverage and covers the trailing halfback closely, the quarterback will keep the ball and run upfield inside of the defensive end. The tailback to the play side is responsible for blocking one of the defensive backs, usually one of the deep safeties. The wide receiver (WR) to the play side is responsible for blocking the corner back assigned to cover them if the defense were playing man coverage.
A 2009 NCAA rule change that allowed linemen to block three yards downfield on a pass (as opposed to one yard in the NFL) opened the college game to the run-pass option (RPO) plays. Much like in a traditional option attack, the quarterback "reads" the defense at the snap and quickly decides how to execute the play depending on the initial actions of one or two "key" defenders. In an RPO play, however, one or more receivers run a pass route, and the quarterback has the option to throw a pass. Because the offensive line (and usually some receivers) run block at the snap, any pass must be thrown very quickly, before blockers have pushed forward three yards. A properly executed RPO is difficult to defend, as a quarterback who correctly reads the defense will run the version of the play which has the best chance for success.
The RPO has also been utilized in the NFL despite rules disallowing linemen to block more than one yard downfield on passing plays, though NFL QBs must make quicker reads to avoid a penalty if they decide to throw a forward pass.

During that year, she collaborated with draftswomen Beatriz Battoine, Irene Ferrando, and Marta Restuccia, and experimented by complementing her samples with audiovisual recordings with Nelson Advalov, which would lead her to new multimedia aesthetic searches in the 1980s. In fact, at the end of the decade, in 1988, she retired from the Engraving Club after promoting an unsuccessful attempt at renewal with Ana Tiscornia.

Physician James Clark wrote a treatise entitled Prevention of Disease in which he argued for the professionalization of the veterinary trade, and the establishment of veterinary colleges. This was finally achieved in 1790, through the campaigning of Granville Penn, who persuaded Frenchman Benoit Vial de St. Bel to accept the professorship of the newly established veterinary college in London. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons was established by royal charter in 1844. Veterinary science came of age in the late 19th century, with notable contributions from Sir John McFadyean, credited by many as having been the founder of modern veterinary research.
In 1866, Calhoun entered in a partnership with James R. Powell, a businessman from Montgomery, Alabama, whereby he moved freedmen from the Southeast to Yazoo County, Mississippi, where they worked on new plantations.

The Human Zoo would be revived to a lesser extent when Boyd began presenting a late Saturday night show on BBC Southern Counties Radio in September 2004. Regular callers included a Johnny Vegas soundalike, someone reading the results of the day's games in the Premier League or the FA Cup, someone doing an impression of Darth Vader breathing, "The Duck", and "Quarter-to-One Mick", a Northern accented gentleman who each week would recite the lyrics of well-known songs towards the end of each show.
The story revolves around a godman, Baba Nirala (Bobby Deol), whose followers (mostly from the disadvantaged sections of the society) have blind faith in him and will do anything that he asks of them, when in reality, he is a conman who ensures that his devotees devote their wealth to him and stay attached to the ashram for life. Politicians Hukum Singh (Sachin Shroff) and incumbent CM Sundar Lal (Anil Rastogi) vie for Baba Nirala's support in the upcoming State Legislative Assembly Elections owing to his large number of followers for their vote bank politics, which only increase after a pop singer, Tinka Singh (Adhyayan Suman) decides to conduct tours with Baba Nirala to promote his new song.

John Howe was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother's help. Around primary school age he found his mother's ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe's school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art classes full, and left him in classes like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology class though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for classmates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from Frank Frazetta, Barry Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. In his adolescence, Howe read The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. He said he got "a real spark" from the Hildebrandt calendars, which showed him that the books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.

The article emphasized among several points the observation that teachers are frequently regarded as identical units of a factory assembly line in the education sector. Mentors regardless of competence teach the same subjects in the same grade, use one kind of textbook, deal with the same number of pupils, and receive equal salaries. This trend has not changed since 1958. The late John W. Gardner who used to be Education Secretary of former President Lyndon Johnson and afterwards Chairman of the Commission insisted that students with academic proficiency should take an additional three years each of mathematics, science, and one foreign language which did not happen.

Educated at Clifton College, Brownlee was a right-handed middle- or lower-order batsman and an infrequent right-arm slow bowler, and was top of the Clifton batting averages in 1900. After leaving school in the summer of 1901, he made his first-class debut for Gloucestershire in two end-of-season matches, and in his first game, against Somerset at Taunton, he made 66 in the Gloucestershire second innings, though he was unable to prevent a Somerset victory with less than an hour of the scheduled match time remaining. A student at Oriel College, Oxford, from the autumn of 1901, he played in one match for the university cricket team in 1902, and in one match for Somerset against the university side – Somerset frequently "borrowed" university players for their matches against the university sides in the first third of the 20th century, but this game has an additional curiosity in that it is one of the few 12-a-side first-class matches. Though unable to break into the Oxford University side, Brownlee played regularly for Gloucestershire when the university term was over, and in the match against Kent at Bristol he scored 103 in the first innings, the only century of his first-class cricket career. In 1903, he was given half a dozen games for the university side but was not successful then, nor in 10 matches for Gloucestershire in the second half of the season: his batting average for the season as a whole was under 10 runs per innings, and his highest score in the season was just 43.
His parents were servants at the Imperial Court, and he originally worked as a footman and stoker. In 1872, he began auditing classes at the Imperial Academy of Arts and was accepted as a student a year later. In 1877, he received a silver medal for his drawings from nature. From 1887 to 1905, he was a teacher at the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts.
Chacón was first appointed to the position of Chairman and interim president following the death of General José María Orellana. He then called for elections in which his main opponent was general Jorge Ubico. Chacón defeated Ubico thanks in part to the strong campaign that journalist Clemente Marroquín Rojas made against the latter in his column called Desnudando al ídolo. Chacón government took some liberties such as creating the National Mortgage Bank (Crédito Hipotecario Nacional) as well as constructing the Faculty of Medicine building for the Faculty of Natural Sciences. During his tenure the Legislative Palace and the national railroad were also completed. During his presidency, the Guatemalan currency was stabilized, but Guatemala suffered the effects of the Great Depression in 1929.
The son of Thomas Watts of Buntingford, Hertfordshire, he was the owner of the Margaret and John, one of the ships paid by the city of London in 1588 to sail against the Spanish armada. Watts himself served in her as a volunteer and saw action. In 1590 the same ship was one of a fleet of merchantmen coming home from the Mediterranean, which successfully fought and repelled the Spanish galleys near Cadiz. Although Watts was not on board, throughout the war he equipped and financed privateers led by Michael Geare, William Lane and Christopher Newport. A few of his notable successes include his financed and organised expedition to the Spanish main in 1590, the expedition to Cuba the following year and James Lancaster's expedition to Recife in April 1595. Watt's received significant prize money from the success of these expeditions. Another in July 1601 took into Plymouth a prize coming from the Indies laden with China silks, satins and taffetas. At this time he was an alderman of London (Tower ward), and had been suspected of being a supporter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.

In cricket, the fielding team is the defense, while the batting team is the offense; the batting team can only put two players on the field at a time. By getting the batting team's batsmen out before they can hit the ball to the boundary or run between the two batsmen's grounds, the fielding team can prevent the batting team from scoring points. Players can be gotten out if they hit the ball in the air and it is caught by a defensive player before touching the ground, or if the ball hits a batsman's wicket, either when delivered by the bowler or when the batsman is not in his ground. By getting all but one of the batting team's players out, the fielding team ends their opponent's scoring turn, and may begin its own scoring turn next (though it can choose not to, in the case of the follow-on).
In ice hockey, there are normally two designated defencemen on the ice. A defence man can either be an offensive player better known for their ability to glean assists or goals rather than for their strong defensive play. Such players are known as offensive defencemen. The other is usually in a more defensive role and rarely show-up on the score sheet but are important for their defensive prowess; these players are known as stay-at-home defence. There are also defensemen who are good at both; known as two-way defensemen. Defense is a team game in hockey, and when the team is not in possession of the puck (also known as puck coverage), the aim is to effectively suppress the puck pressure coming from the opponents.

The Tulsa Race Massacre broke out on the night of May 31 - June 1, 1921. The new Mount Zion Baptist Church was deliberately burned by a mob of white men, who had heard a rumor that blacks were using the building to store rifles that had been brought there in caskets. No evidence of such storage ever surfaced. However, it was true that some armed blacks used the structure as a vantage point for firing on rioters that were attacking nearby houses. The whites could not dislodge the blacks until some local guardsmen brought up a truck with a machine gun and opened fire. This more powerful weaponry began knocking bricks out of the building, and it was soon in flames.
Anneke Ogiers was the daughter of Jan Ogiersz and married to the wealthy craftsman Adriaan Boogaert in Haarlem. She seldom attended the Catholic mass, which was mandatory during the Spanish rule, and Aagt Jafies, who was infamous for reporting heresy to the authorities, was informed by the maidservant of Anneke Ogiers that Ogiers read the Bible each sunday instead of attending mass. Aagt Jafies initially attempted blackmail, but when Ogiers refused to submit to blackmail, Aagt Jafies reported her to Jacob Foppens. She confessed to have been baptized a Lutheran in 1557. After the investigation found her to be a Lutheran, she was sentenced to death for heresy. Foppens demanded for her to be executed by burning, as was normal for heretics. She was however pardoned from being burned at the stake in public, and was instead commuted to being drowned inside the city hall instead. Her case was described in the Martelaersspiegel, where she was included among the martyrs.

In 1865, Christian Dorflinger, a French-speaking Alsatian immigrant, opened a glass factory in White Mills. Dorflinger had arrived in the United States in 1846 and established a prosperous glass company based in Brooklyn in 1852, but decided to build a dedicated factory and company town for the Dorflinger Glass Company at White Mills, in order to escape the pollution and violence of New York at the time. At White Mills, Dorflinger and his sons built a sprawling factory complex and more than 100 houses for workers and their families. The town was in large part populated by craftsman who Dorflinger invited from Europe to work at the factory. Dorflinger Glass produced fine cut lead crystal that was used in the White House services of the Lincoln and Harrison administrations, and at prominent occasions such as the weddings of William Vanderbilt and Nellie Grant. Production at the factory continued until 1921, when pressures related to prohibition and lingering effects of an embargo on German potash forced the company to cease operations. Upon the factory's closing, White Mills lost much of its population. In 2017, the remaining Dorflinger Glass Factory buildings were restored and turned into a museum.

Thesiger was originally destined for a naval career, and he served as a midshipman on in 1807 at the second bombardment of Copenhagen. His only surviving brother died about this time, however, and he became entitled to succeed to a valuable estate in the West Indies. It was decided that he should leave the navy and study law with a view to practising in the West Indies and eventually managing his property in person. He proceeded to enter at Gray's Inn in 1813, and was called to the bar on 18 November 1818. He joined the home circuit, and soon got into good practice at the Surrey sessions, while he also made a fortunate purchase in buying the right to appear in the old palace court (see Lord Steward). Another change of fortune, however, awaited him, for a volcano destroyed the family estate, and he was thrown back upon his prospect of a legal practice in the West Indies.

Moore was also known for his straight pool exhibition work, as a formidable , and for his unusual pool style, which included both his flamboyant cowboy dress, and his rare form of cueing technique known as a . Moore also worked as a technical adviser for billiard-related scenes in television and film in such productions as My Living Doll, and the Jerry Lewis movie The Family Jewels. He is an inductee of the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame, the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame, and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame.
By that time Moore was recognizable by his cowboy airs. He customarily wore cowboy boots, a white Stetson hat and a string tie, kept his hair in a crew-cut, and was rarely seen without a cigar. He was also known for his unusual form of stroke. Moore employed a —a shooting technique in which a player releases his gripping hand briefly and re-grasps the cue farther back on the butt just before hitting the cue ball. Employing the slip stroke to good effect, Moore was deadly accurate, but could also shoot with great power.
Though Moore continued playing on the road—as he would for over 40 years—he began competing and placing in top-tier tournaments. His tournament career was to be overshadowed by an enduring series of runner-up finishes that would earn him the nickname "pool's underpaid prince" in such publications as Esquire Magazine. The name that stuck with him for life, however, was Cowboy. According to Moore, he became 'Cowboy' Jimmy Moore when he appeared at the Commodore Hotel championships in New York City in the 1950s wearing the required tuxedo, but nevertheless sporting cowboy boots and his signature white Stetson hat.

In October Contessa was chosen at the last minute to solve a problem facing Operation Torch planners in rapidly supplying the airfield to be captured at Port-Lyautey that lay up the Sebou River with aviation gasoline and munitions. The piers at the Port-Lyautey airfield lay in a "U" bend of the river approximately five miles from the landing beaches but nine miles up the shallow river with a maximum depth that even at the highest November tides limited access to ships drawing no more than . Contessa arrived at Norfolk as the convoy was preparing to sail in a leaking condition with engine problems that required immediate dry docking expected to take several days. By extraordinary effort the ship was repaired early, but in the meantime much of the crew had left town in expectation of a longer stay. Three days late, with a crew filled out from seaman volunteers from a local Naval brig released from minor offenses, the ship got underway from the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation in the early hours of 27 October in an unescorted dash across the Atlantic to join the convoy. Contessa, loaded with only 738 tons of gasoline and bombs, overtook the convoy on 7 November. At 1620 on 10 November the Contessa entered the Sebou River, led by with a U.S. Army Raider battalion embarked and followed by , to deliver the aviation gasoline and munitions for the seventy-seven Army P-40 aircraft launched in the morning by the auxiliary aircraft carrier but ran aground when passing the Kasba and had to await a higher tide the morning of 11 November.
This is a list of rock music genres consisting of subgenres of popular music that have roots in the 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, and which developed into a distinct identity as rock music in the 1960s, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom. By the late 1960s, a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene. New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques. Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history.

Car #26 is a wooden passenger car riding on two 27-E Brill trucks, where each "truck" is a unit with four 36-inch wheels, axles, electric motors, springs, and brakes. The motors were driven by trolley poles which conducted current from electric wires that ran above the track. The car's top speed was 45 mph. The body of the car is 44 feet long, eight feet eight inches wide, and about nine feet high. The rounded corners allowed the car to move more safely through crowded city streets. The sides are sheathed in wood paneling. The roof is wood covered with canvas, with a band of arched clerestory openings filled with green opalescent glass on both sides. Each side has six arched windows, with green glass transoms, and an arched door on each end. The glass is manufactured by the Kokomo Opalescent Glass Works. Inside the car, each end has a conductor/motorman vestibule with a set of controllers for the car. When the car reversed direction, the motorman and the conductor swapped ends of the car. Between the vestibules are a small smoking passenger compartment and a non-smoking compartment.

Solomon was forced to capitulate in March 1810, but he escaped from captivity and reignited an anti-Russian rebellion in May 1810. The Russian commander-in-chief Alexander Tormasov retaliated by ordering General Simonovich to incarcerate Mariam, her sister Maria, wife of Prince Davit Mikeladze, and Solomon's sister Mariam, wife of Prince Malkhaz Andronikashvili, at the fortress of Poti. The arrested noblewomen were to receive food from their own estates; giving money to them was prohibited. Simonovich advised caution, warning that harsh treatment of the female dignitaries would exasperate the Imeretians.

Music Go-Go Boots expands on the country and soul music influences of the band's previous work. Phil Mongredien of The Observer writes that "the influence of Aretha and Otis occasionally informs their country/southern rock fusion [...] with a smattering of 60s soul-inspired flourishes". The band's guitarist and frontman Patterson Hood described the album as their "most different and most Muscle Shoals sounding album." The band recorded two covers by fellow Muscle Shoals artist Eddie Hinton for the album. Bassist Shonna Tucker sings Hinton's "Where's Eddie", while Hood performs "Everybody Needs Love".
In a 2012 interview, the band's frontman Jim Kerr expressed regret that the album's production had resulted in the tracks lacking "a real spark" that was part of their live performances, and described his feelings about the album as "bittersweet". He recalled at the time, "as we were about to drive up to Scotland, someone gave me a cassette of Unknown Pleasures'' by Joy Division... and I thought, we've completely blown it."—ruing that their live material had sounded more like Velvet Underground and less like the Boomtown Rats.

Charuka Kahagalla (born 9 June 1988) is a Sri Lankan cricketer. He is a left-handed batsman and right-arm off-break bowler who plays for Sebastianites Cricket and Athletic Club. He was born in Diwulapitaya.
As the opening credits roll, a band called Flux, apparently with no singer, starts to play at a nightclub. Among the audience is a girl named Courtney Lane (Tammin Sursok). Interspersed with the scenes of the band playing, lead singer Nikko Alexander (Nolan Gerard Funk) calmly walks into the club through the back, barely making his cue for "Don't Tell Me". At the end of the song, he kicks over one of the amps, destroying it for effect. After the performance, the other members of Flux, upset by his carelessness, kick him out of the band; Nikko's girlfriend Amy (Britt Irvin), who is also in the band, dumps him. After the band members leave, Courtney frantically attempts to recruit Nikko into a show choir named "Spectacular!," of which she is leader. Though Nikko is skeptical and condescendingly rejects her offer, Courtney begs him to come to a carnival to see the choir perform and then make his decision.
The next day at the carnival, Nikko arrives in time to see the Spectacular! show choir perform "Eye of the Tiger". Afterward, the ever-anxious Courtney once again attempts to persuade Nikko, who is less than impressed by the group's performance and style, to join the show choir and help them win a national contest, even offering him half the group's earnings from the contest in exchange for his consent. Nikko declines to join the group, stating that he isn't interested in choir. Soon, another show choir named Ta-da performs "Things We Do for Love". The lead singers are Royce (Simon Curtis), who used to be the lead singer for Spectacular! but quit after breaking up with Courtney, and Tammi (Victoria Justice), Royce's new girlfriend who is a snobby and selfish girl. It is hinted she was a member of "Spectacular!" because of the number of times Courtney calls her a backstabber and that the letter I in her name stand for the "ice in her veins". Later on, Nikko meets with and performs for a famous music producer named Mr. Dickenson (Matthew Bennett), who informs him that he has a shot at getting a record deal if he can raise enough money for equipment for his demo, which has to be excellent. Nikko recalls Courtney's offer of half the earnings from the contest Spectacular! plans to perform in, and decides to join the choir in order to get the money to pay for his demo. When he approaches the choir Courtney remembers his mockery of their carnival performance and initially refuses to let him join, but acquiesces after Nikko demonstrates his talent by performing "Break My Heart" in front of the whole group, who are impressed by his vocals. When they are practicing, however, Nikko finds out that dancing for show choir is not as easy as it looks and cannot easily pick up the dance routines. Nikko, who lives with his older brother Stavros (Christopher Jacot), does not inform his brother that he has joined show choir or that he is attempting to get a record deal because he knows Stavros would not approve.
Several days later the group, dressed in hideous cowboy costumes, goes to perform at the club Nikko and his old band, Flux, had performed at in the beginning of the movie. There Nikko runs into his old band members, leading to an awkward confrontation and a lot of mockery from Flux. Meanwhile, Ta-da, who are also at the club, performs their song "Lonely Love Song". Nikko discovers from the other Spectacular! members that Royce is Courtney's ex-boyfriend. Upon witnessing Ta-da's good performance and the snobby attitudes of Tammi and Royce, Nikko becomes determined to help Spectacular! win the upcoming competition and begins to think that the group should come up with new dance moves and new music. One day, before Courtney arrives for choir practice, Nikko encourages the other choir members to try things a different way, and performs "Your Own Way", persuading the others to join in, Nikko sang the beginning of the song, and ask the others to show some talents, Tajid (Avan Jogia) started beatboxing, then other members Janet (Shannon Chan-Kent), Caspian (Joel Ballard) and Robin (Andrea Lewis) showcase their singing talent. Though they are initially reluctant to go against Courtney's wishes, the rest of the group eventually agree that they need a new routine in order to win the competition. They later meet up at Nikko's house, unbeknown to Courtney, and Nikko begins to teach them new dance moves, stating that if they perform the song in front of Courtney she would be impressed and may agree to change the group's style. The choir assembles at Nikko's house every night to practice while still attending practices with Courtney every afternoon.

Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo, (; ; 21 February 1822 – 8 February 1872) styled Lord Naas (; ) from 1842 to 1867 and Lord Mayo in India, was a British statesman and prominent member of the British Conservative Party who served as Chief Secretary for Ireland (1852, 1858–9, 1866–8) and Viceroy of India (1869–72).
Mayo was born in Dublin, Ireland, the eldest son of Robert Bourke, 5th Earl of Mayo (the son of Hon. Richard Burke, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore), and his wife, Anne Charlotte, daughter of the Hon. John Jocelyn. His younger brother the Hon. Robert Bourke was also a successful politician. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He and his brothers were accomplished horsemen and enjoyed fox hunting.
In 1683 near Guinea, privateer John Cook captured a Dutch merchantman which he named Batchelor's Delight, which itself had been the Portsmouth when captured by Dutch privateers from its English owners. With Cook were William Dampier and Edward Davis, who would later captain the ship after Cook died in 1684, as well as sailor Josiah Raynor. They sailed around South America raiding Spanish shipping and towns in concert with Charles Swan's Cygnet and others.
Some sources show the Batchelor's Delight in the hands of former crewman (and associate of Cook's) James Kelley after Raynor's departure; Kelley continued his piracy in the Indian Ocean before he was captured by Moorish pirates in 1692. They burned his ship and killed many of the pirates, but Kelley and a few of his crew escaped their captors and made their way back to Madagascar. There they sailed with Robert Culliford for a time before returning to America alongside William Kidd; soon afterwards they were arrested, transported to London for trial, and executed. However, there were known to be multiple ships of the same name (Bachelor's Delight / Batchelor's Delight) operating in the same time period; some sources say that Raynor and crew abandoned the Batchelor's Delight at Madagascar (where Kelley claimed it), so it is possible that the ship Loyal Jamaica in which Raynor returned to the Carolinas was a captured prize ship (perhaps renamed) and not Davis' original ship.

The Spanish Governor of the Mariana Islands, Francisco Moscoso y Lara, welcomed and provided aid to Libelle shipwreck survivors on Guam. He also ordered the schooner Ana, owned and commanded by his son-in-law George H. Johnston, to be dispatched with the first mate Kausch to search for the missing gig and then sail on to Wake Island to confirm the shipwreck story and recover the buried treasure. Ana departed Guam on April 10 and, after two days at Wake Island, found and salvaged the buried coins and precious stones as well as a small quantity of the quicksilver. Over the next two years other ships sailed to the shipwreck site to conduct salvage operations. In January 1867, the American schooner, Caroline Mills brought a diving suit, then commonly known as "submarine armour", to Libelle wreck site. Only a few flasks of quicksilver were recovered using the diving suit so Captain Nickols decided to abandon the effort. On May 9, 1867, the sloop Hokulele from Honolulu, with a party headed by Thomas R. Foster, arrived at Wake and was joined by a brig from China. The Chinese captain did not reveal his ship's name. Together the two ships recovered 495 flasks of the quicksilver with 247 flasks going to Hokulele. In October 1867, the Honolulu schooner Moi Wahine arrived at Wake and Captain English, Thomas R. Foster (who also sailed with Hokulele) and nine Hawaiian divers were landed on the island with part of their supplies. Captain Zenas Bent, first mate Mr. White and seven Hawaiian seamen remained on board the ship. In the evening on the second day, when the winds picked up and shifted, the crew of the schooner pulled anchor and put out to sea to avoid striking the reef. The next day Moi Wahine did not return having perished in a gale, stranding the salvage party on Wake. Fortunately for the party, one piece of equipment that was unloaded from the ship was an apparatus for distilling water. With plenty of potable water, fish, birds and eggs, the men were able to survive and live without serious inconvenience. After five months, the British brig Cleo arrived at Wake, rescued the castaways and recovered 240 flasks of quicksilver, some copper, anchor and chain.
Sultanov, however, was a widely hated figure by the Armenians of Karabakh, objected to his threats to compel them to fully submit to Azerbaijani rule. Tensions reached a high point on June 3, when Sultanov ordered his troops to encircle the Armenian quarter of Shusha and demanded that the members of the Karabakh Council and the Armenian militiamen holed up there to surrender. The Armenian barricades and the British military mission came under fire, but Sultanov's troops were unable to dislodge the defenders. Although the Karabakh Council relented on June 4, the next day Sultanov called on the cavalry commanded by his brother, Sultan, to attack the nearby Armenian villages of Khaibalikend, Krkejan, Pahliul, Jamillu, leaving at least six hundred Armenians dead and the settlements in ruins. Amid protests by Armenians and American relief officials, Sultanov was recalled to Baku. Conflicting reasons are given for this: the Azerbaijani government insisted that they had recalled him for consultations; the British command in Tiflis announced that he had been deprived of his position and was facing charges; while American reports stated that he had been arrested and imprisoned.

Undeterred, Allan went ahead with publication and sent a copy to Robert Holland-Martin, Chairman of the Southern Railway, who welcomed it and congratulated Allan on his entrepreneurial spirit. No further objection was raised to Allan's continued employment with the Southern, although he was barred from the Locomotive Drawing Office and informed that communications with the Locomotive Department had to be sent through official channels. The first edition was quickly sold out and enlarged editions followed with photographs provided by O.J. Morris, who had been a frequent contributor to the Southern Railway magazine. The ABC of Great Western Locomotives was published in 1943, followed by the ABC of London Midland & Scottish Locomotives, and the ABC of LNER Locomotives. The 20,000 copies of the first edition of an ABC guide covering London Transport railways, trams, buses, trolleybuses and coaches sold out in a few days despite the poor quality paper used. Allan's guides proved to be a success, leading to the emerging of trainspotting as a national hobby. With Mollie Franklin (later his wife) he formed the Ian Allan Locospotters' Club in 1949, which eventually grew to some 230,000 members.

Eddie Futch was first hired by Frazier, and his chief cornerman and manager Yank Durham to help him prepare for a fight with "Scrap Iron" Johnson in 1967. He trained Frazier to stay low and constantly bob and weave, in order to create a sense of persistent motion and pressure. This also took advantage of Frazier's lack of size to make him an elusive target. It was unique fighting style that enabled him to get inside where his punches could reach his opponents without taking as much punishment as boxing with a more conventional fighting style would.

It then turns to seven friends as they start out on a road trip to Las Vegas, with Phil (JoJo Wright) recording the trip for his girlfriend Julia. The group hits a road block en route to their destination, prompting them to take a detour that results in several flat tires. The group decides that the women will remain behind to watch the truck while the men go to look for help. The men eventually come across a rest-stop motel that sells tires, introducing themselves to the gas attendant Brad and the shop owner Steve (Braxton Davis) and Norah (Dallas Lovato).

At around 12:30 am on the morning of 11 February 1818 Cantillon attempted to assassinate the Duke of Wellington, the British commander of the allied occupation of France. At the time Wellington was staying in a hotel on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The assassination attempt began as Wellington was returning by carriage from dinner with the British Ambassador to France, Sir Charles Stuart. Cantillon ran across the road in front of the carriage, which raised the suspicions of Wellington's coachman who increased speed. As the coach turned to enter the gate of the hotel Cantillon fired one shot from a pistol. The shot missed and Wellington was not alarmed as he thought the shot was an unintentional discharge from a sentry.
He used floral and figural marquetry techniques to a great extent, contrasting with refined parquetry and trelliswork grounds, in addition to gilt-bronze mounts. His carcases were more finely finished than those of many of his Parisian contemporaries, and he attempted to disguise the screwheads that attached his mounts with overhanging details of foliage.

In December, 1832 the Georgia General Assembly designated the extreme northwestern corner of the state as Murray County. Formerly part of Cherokee County, the area was named for a distinguished Georgia statesman from Lincoln County, Mr. Thomas W. Murray, a former speaker of the Georgia House. Within a short time the legislature found the county was too large to administer properly as the population grew, for the county then included what is now Dade, Walker, Catoosa, Whitfield, Murray, Gordon and parts of Bartow and Chatooga Counties, so further division became necessary. Within two decades, Murray County came to be of land with Spring Place as its county seat until the railroad was built through Chatsworth. With Chatsworth more accessible, the county seat was moved there.
In a certain tradition, the journeyman years () are a time of travel for several years after completing apprenticeship as a craftsman. The tradition dates back to medieval times and is still alive in France, Scandinavia and the German-speaking countries. Normally three years and one day is the minimum period of journeyman/woman. Crafts include roofing, metalworking, woodcarving, carpentry and joinery, and even millinery and musical instrument making/organ building.
In medieval times the apprentice was bound to his master for a number of years. He lived with the master as a member of the household, receiving most or all of his compensation in the form of food and lodging; in Germany an apprentice normally had to pay a fee (German: Lehrgeld) for his apprenticeship. After the years of apprenticeship (Lehrjahre) the apprentice was absolved from his obligations (this absolution was known as a Freisprechung). The guilds, however, would not allow a young craftsman without experience to be promoted to master—they could only choose to be employed, but many chose instead to roam about.
Until craftsmen became masters, they would only be paid by the day (the French word journée refers to the time span of a day). In parts of Europe, such as in later medieval Germany, spending time as a journeyman (Geselle), moving from one town to another to gain experience of different workshops, became an important part of the training of an aspirant master. Carpenters in Germany have retained the tradition of travelling journeymen even today, although only a small minority still practice it.
In the Middle Ages, the number of years spent journeying differed according to the craft. Only after half of the required journeyman years (Wanderjahre) would the craftsman register with a guild for the right to be an apprentice master. After completing the journeyman years, he would settle in a workshop of the guild and after toughing it out for several more years (Mutjahre), he would be allowed to produce a "masterpiece" (German: Meisterstück) and to present it to the guild. With their consent he would be promoted to guild master and as such be allowed to open his own guild workshop in town.
The development of social-contract theories resulted in a system of subscriptions and certificates. When arriving in a new town the journeyman would be pointed to a survey master (Umschaumeister) or to a survey companion (Umschaugeselle). He would be given a list of workshops to present himself to find work (Umschau literally means "look-around"). When not succeeding the journeyman would be given a small amount of money (Zehrgeld) - enough to sustain his travel to the next town. Otherwise he would get a place in a guild shelter (Gesellenherberge). His name would be added to the guild chest (Zunftlade) along with a declaration of how long he would be bound to the master, usually for half a year. Both sides could recall that subscription (Einschreibung) at any time. The subscription of a new companion commonly became the occasion of a big carousal among the other bound journeymen in town.
When leaving the town the guild would hand over a certificate (Kundschaft) telling of the work achievements along with asserting the journeyman's proper conduct and the orderly ending of the subscription. It was hard to find a new subscription in the next town without it, but in reality, masters did often complain about journeymen running away. Many guild shelters had a black board telling the names of such absconders - along with the debts they had left behind. The certificates were hand-written until about 1730, when printed forms evolved with places to fill in details. By about 1770 the forms started to carry a copperplate print of the cityscape. The certificates were often large and unhandy, so that smaller travelling books replaced them by about 1820. This practice coincided with the establishment of modern police in Europe after the coalition wars (1803-1815) against Napoleon. The guild chest was replaced by state offices to keep registers. In some places the guilds were even banned from maintaining registers.
The tradition of the journeyman years (auf der Walz sein) persisted well into the 1920s in German-speaking countries, but was set back by multiple events like Nazis allegedly banning the tradition, the postwar German economic boom making it seem too much of a burden, and in East Germany the lack of opportunities for work in an economic system based on Volkseigener Betrieb. Beginning in the late 1980s, renewed interest in tradition in general together with economic changes (especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall) have caused the tradition to gain wider acceptance. The tradition was brought back to life mostly unchanged from the medieval concept since the journeyman brotherhoods (Schächte) never ceased to exist. (including a Confederation of European Journeymen Associations).
The journeyman brotherhoods had established a standard to ensure that wandering journeymen are not mistaken for tramps and vagabonds. The journeyman is required to be unmarried, childless and debt-free—so that the journeyman years will not be taken as a chance to run away from social obligations. In modern times the brotherhoods often require a police clearance. Additionally, journeymen are required to wear a specific uniform (Kluft) and to present themselves in a clean and friendly manner in public. This helps them to find shelter for the night and a ride to the next town.
A travelling book (Wanderbuch) was given to the journeyman and in each new town, he would go to the town office asking for a stamp. This qualifies both as a record of his journey and also replaces the residence registration that would otherwise be required. In contemporary brotherhoods, the "Walz" is required to last at least three years and one day (sometimes two years and one day). During the journeyman years the wanderer is not allowed to return within a perimeter of 50 km of his home town, except in specific emergency situations, such as the impending death of an immediate relative (parents and siblings).
There are secret signs, such as specific, involved handshakes, that German carpenters traditionally use to identify each other. They are taught to the beginning journeyman before he leaves. This is another traditional method to protect the trade against impostors. While less necessary in an age of telephones, identity cards and official diplomas, the signs are still retained as a tradition. Teaching them to anybody who has not successfully completed a carpenter apprenticeship is still considered very wrong, even though it is no longer a punishable crime today.
As of 2005, there were 600 to 800 journeymen "on the Walz", either associated with a brotherhood or running free. While the great majority are still male, young women are no longer unheard of on the Walz today.
Journeymen can be easily recognised on the street by their clothing. The carpenter's black hat has a broad brim; some professions use a black stovepipe hat or a cocked hat. The carpenters wear black bell-bottoms and a waistcoat and carry the Stenz, which is a traditional curled hiking pole. Since many professions have since converted to the uniform of the carpenters, many people in Germany believe that only carpenters go journeying, which is untrue – since the carpenter's uniform is best known and well received, it simply eases the journey.
The uniform is completed with a golden earring and golden bracelets—which could be sold in hard times and in the Middle Ages could be used to pay the gravedigger if any wanderer should die on his journey. The journeyman carried his belongings in a leather backpack called the Felleisen, but some medieval towns, Charlottenburg probably having been the first and there, in particular, the temporary homes dedicated to house journeymen, banned those (for the fleas in them) so that most journeyman started to make use of a coarse cloth thus called Charlottenburger (abbreviated to "Charlie") to wrap up their belongings.
While the institution of the journeyman years is original to craftsmen, the concept has spread to other professions. As such, a priest could set out on an extended journey to do research in the libraries of monasteries across Europe and gain wider knowledge and experience.
The traveler books or Wanderbücher are an important research source that show migration paths in the early period of industrialisation in Europe. Journeymen's paths often show boundaries of language and religion that hindered travel of craftsmen "on the Walz".

At the outbreak of the Civil War, Capt. Tattnall held command of the Sackett's Harbor Station. Though he opposed secession, Tattnall resigned his commission on February 21, 1861. A week later, Governor Joseph E. Brown commissioned Tattnall as the senior flag officer of the Navy of Georgia. On March 26, 1861, he received his commission as a captain in the Confederate Navy. Tattnall commanded Southern naval units during the defense of Port Royal until the harbor was captured by Union forces on 7 November 1861. From there, he moved to overall command of the defense of Virginia's waters early in March 1862. Tattnall, by then a flag officer in the Confederate Navy as well as the Navy of Georgia, directed CSS Jamestown and other warships in captures of Federal merchantmen off Sewell's Point in April 1862.
at the end of a deep fiord with numerous drumlins created by the last Ice Age, Pleasant Point lies on Kent Island. The local weather is moderated by the ocean, with it being generally milder in winter and cooler in the summer than most inland areas. Many forms of wildlife inhabit the area with pheasants, foxes, coyotes and bald eagles being very common. The French Point Lighthouse is one of the two Musquodoboit Harbour Range Lights found at Pleasant Point. This old lighthouse stands at the end of the Kent Road. The lighthouse, though not in use, is one of three lighthouses that remain standing on the entire Eastern shore, the only one in Halifax Regional Municipality accessible by land. No public access to the lighthouse is permitted. The lighthouse was used for years for navigational purposes to ensure the safety of fishermen and other vessels entering Musquodoboit Harbour. It is on private land - Kent Island, although the actual "footprint" where the lighthouse stands is owned by the Federal Government. Only a handful of residences can be found in Pleasant Point and the population is less than 100 people. Notorious Canadian art thief John Tillmann was a year-round resident of Pleasant Point.

With the money earned from selling the nickelodeon theater, Peter acquires the license and establishes his own film production company, Magnum Studio, granting Johnny 10% of the shares. They steadily produce two-reel pictures, and although satisfied with their results, have high hopes of producing a six-reel feature.

The injured include the ship's commanding officer and two sailors.
He was initially condemned by the exiled Perón, who viewed the UP as an attempt to develop a political alternative to the banned Peronist movement. Nor was he the only neo-Peronist leader to emerge in 1955; these also included Cipriano Reyes, who formed the Labor Party, and Vicente Saadi, who formed the Populist Party. All three were Peronists who played key roles in the movement's earliest days, and who later fell out with the populist leader. Each one openly defied Perón by forming these alternatives to his line, and more so by fielding candidates for elections to the Constitutional Assembly of 1957 (tasked with replacing Perón's 1949 Constitution). The UP adopted the Peronist tenets of nationalism and social democracy, while rejecting the personality cult Perón and the late Evita had engendered. The party received a significant boost when Alejandro Leloir, the last Chairman of the Peronist Party' executive committee before Perón's overthrow, joined the UP. Bramuglia issued conciliatory statements in a number of news magazines, and thus distanced himself from Perón's rhetoric, which, during 1956, was largely inflammatory in nature.
The UP elected no Congressmen in 1958, and was barred from running in 1960. President Frondizi lifted the ban ahead of the March 18, 1962, mid-term elections, and ended government receivership over the CGT labor union. The joint developments allowed Bramuglia to form an alliance with the influential textile industry union leader, Andrés Framini. Framini's UP candidacy for Governor of Buenos Aires would then receive an unexpected endorsement: that of Perón, who believed these elections to be a unique chance to regain a role in government for Peronism. Joined on the ticket by Marcos Anglada, Framini's unofficial slogan was unequivocal: "Framini-Anglada, Perón to the Rosada!"
The Argentine Congress remained dissolved for seven years. Tercera del Franco was succeeded as the President of the UP in 1970 by Carlos Insúa, who had been President of the Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata football team from 1948 to 1955, and had been one of the UP Congressmen who had been denied a seat following the 1962 elections. Tercera del Franco remained involved in the committee, and was among those interviewed by Perón during the latter's November 1972 visit to Argentina. The last of a series of three dictators, General Alejandro Lanusse negotiated a return to democracy with Peronists (who remained the largest political force in Argentina). The UP was largely subsumed into the Justicialist Party, though Insúa was among those elected to Congress in the 1973 elections that brought Peronists back to power. The Peronist restoration unraveled following Perón's death in July 1974, and ended with the March 1976 coup.

On the night of March 22, 1782, Estill and his militiamen encountered the Wyandot raiding party. Separated by Little Mountain Creek, they were a mile and a half north of Little Mountain. The two sides fought in a violent, pitched battle for nearly two hours. The Wyandot leader, Sourehoowah, was reportedly shot by the first volley and urged his men to continue fighting as he lay dying.
With Estill's left flank now open and the creek defended by only four men, the Wyandots easily rushed in, killing Estill and six others as the militiamen retreated. Estill had already been wounded three times. As he attempted to escape with his men, he was killed in hand-to-hand combat by a pursuing Wyandot warrior. Militiaman Joseph Proctor witnessed Estill's death and shot the attacker dead with his rifle.
Only a handful of men is left on each side, and the battle ended with the Kentuckians withdrawing from the field. Those Kentuckians who had been captured reported later that the Wyandots had suffered about 20 casualties. Monk Estill, who had escaped during the battle, reported that 17 Wyandots had been killed and two more wounded. This was confirmed by another prisoner who later escaped. Among the 18 Kentuckians who survived the battle at Little Mountain were frontiersman James Anderson, David Lynch, and William Irving. Adam Caperton, the father of United States Congressman Hugh Caperton, was killed.

He often frequented Harry Hill's bar, a hugely popular sportsman resort and the center of New York's sporting culture during the late 19th century. He became a sparring partner for then bare knuckle champion Joe Goss and later helped train Paddy Ryan who would defeat Goss for the title in 1880.
On March 31, 1881, at a testimonial benefit in Harry Hill's resort, an offer was made by New York sportsmen in attendance to give $50 to any man who, using Marquis of Queensbury rules, could last four rounds with John L. Sullivan. This was in reference to the more widely known challenge with Sullivan had posted to Paddy Ryan. Taylor, Ryan's former trainer, accepted in this first-ever impromptu boxing match. Refereed by Matt Grace, a well-known collar and elbow wrestler, while Dick Hollywood and Billy Madden were the cornermen for Mahan and Sullivan respectively.

After the bout, Mahan said "Taylor [Mahan] takes his hat off only to Sully". The event received much attention from the press, this being the young Sullivan's New York debut, and was especially covered by the Police Gazette, the New York Clipper and the New York Herald.
A falkusa (; ) is a traditional fishing boat used by fishermen from the town of Komiža on the Adriatic island of Vis, Croatia. Falkuša is a subtype of gajeta, a traditional Dalmatian fishing sailboat, and is sometimes called gajeta falkuša (). Its design was adapted to the specific needs of Komiža fishermen, who went to long fishing expeditions in the open seas, a unique practice in the Adriatic and Mediterranean.
A typical falkuša carried a crew of six men. There were five oars for standing oarsmen which were 7 to 9 meters in length. The fishermen used nets and a feral, a gas or petroleum lamp for attracting fish. Fishing trips lasted 20 to 25 days, to make them financially viable. Duties such as cooking, washing, repairing, sailing between fishing posts and dealing with bad weather left only 10 to 12 days for actual fishing in a typical journey.
The main fishing ground exploited by Komiža's fishermen was the island of Palagruža, approximately to the south-southwest of Vis, which at times was used by fifty or more vessels. On the island there were provisional houses, which they used to store barrels of salted sardines and fishing equipment.
Fishermen of Komiža would hold an annual regatta between Komiža and Palagruža, known as Rota Palagruzona ("Palagruža Route"), a trip which would take about 5 hours of sailing with a good wind, or 13 to 16 hours of rowing when wind conditions were poor. The outcome of the regatta was very important, because top finishers won the rights to the best fishing areas around Palagruža for the season, and the other places were taken in the order of arrival.
The first known regatta to Palagruža was held as far back as 1593 making it the oldest fishermen's regatta in Europe. Komiža's fishermen met in May 1593 in the Lodge in the town of Hvar. There it was agreed that the race of 74 falkuša boats would start on June 12. To signal the start of the race a cannon shot would be fired from the newly built town fortress. The fishermen were accompanied by Venetian war galleys in order to protect them from pirates.

Goodman's sculpture has been featured at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago ("Art in Chicago 1945-1995" survey), Indianapolis Museum of Art, Brauer Museum of Art, and Museum of Outdoor Arts (2018). He has been awarded public commissions for Chicago's McCormick Place Convention Center, the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Indiana University Northwest, and cities in Connecticut, Indiana and Michigan, among others. Curator Gregg Hertzlieb describes Goodman's abstract sculptures as "sophisticated explorations of formal issues [that] concurrently pulse with organic life … and appeal to the hand, the eye, and the mind." In an earlier review, New Art Examiner editor Kathryn Hixson called him a "sculptor's sculptor" whose "purposeful craftsmanship of ritualistic tableaux and talismanic objects" engages "the sensual shift from two to three dimensions."
After the war, the freed black population predominated by number in the county for decades. After emancipation and granting of citizenship and the franchise, most freedmen joined the Republican Party, which they credited with gaining their freedom. Conservative white Democrats resisted political domination by blacks, although they were outnumbered. In the later years of Reconstruction, whites used violence, intimidation and fraud to suppress black voting. In 1908 the white-dominated legislature passed an amendment that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor whites ones.
William Henry Harrison, also known as Bill Thomas before emancipation, was a freedman and politician, a member of the Georgia House of Representatives elected during Reconstruction.

Something for the Rest of Us is the ninth studio album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls. It was released on August 28, 2010 in Australia and on August 31 in North America through Warner Bros. Records. The recording process took place during the spring to fall of 2009 in the GCR Audio studio in Buffalo and Paramount Studios as well as "the Ark" in Los Angeles, with producer Tim Palmer. A single had been originally slated to be released in November 2009 with an album release in February 2010, but the band went back into the studio in January 2010. According to lead singer and guitarist John Rzeznik, this was done to make further improvements on what they had previously thought had been a finished record. Several producers were brought in to assist on the production process, including Butch Vig, John Fields, Paul David Hager and Rob Cavallo. Something for the Rest of Us is the third Goo Goo Dolls studio album that Cavallo has produced (Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower). When asked about the length of time between albums, Rzeznik admitted it was a mix of songwriting issues as well as taking time out for personal reasons; "I wanted to really dig deep and there are a million songs I threw away, like, “Nah, it's not good enough. I wanna do something different. I wanna do something better, go deeper. I also wanted to have a life with my girlfriend for a while. I owed it to her to spend some time with her and be normal and be in one place. That was kind of important." In one of the Ustream sessions, Robby revealed that the album would have twelve songs and "Real" is not among them. In late May, John announced that "Home" would be the first single and was released onto radio and iTunes stores on June 8, 2010.

Stratico became a violinist in the orchestra of the Basilica del Santo. In his Memorie sul violinista G. Tartini (1758), the physicist Giordano Riccati mentioned that Stratico was an outstanding violinist in the orchestra of the Basilica del Santo. His six sonatas for violin and violoncello or harpsichord, the only work published during his lifetime, came out through Peter Welcker in London, ca. 1763. This edition might have been arranged by his brother Simeone, who around that time studied shipbuilding in England. The edition is dedicated to Girolamo Lion Cavazza, the Paduan nobleman who owned large properties in Sanguinetto. The latest information on Stratico as a composer comes from a 1776 letter in which Giovenale Sacchi, a musician and theorist from Milan, asked Giordano Riccati for an evaluation of Stratico's works in order to include one of his pieces in an anthology of Psalms settings which he intended to publish.

In 1448 and 1534, great fires beset the town. After the unification of the County of Leiningen-Dagsburg with the Barony of Westerburg in 1467, Reinhard IV of Westerburg, who as of 1481 began calling himself Count Reinhard I at Leiningen-Westerburg, moved his seat to the County of Leiningen. Only as of 1557 was Westerburg once again a seat for sidelines of the once more sundering House of Leiningen or its family branch, Leiningen-Westerburg. Westerburg townsmen (Bürger) had at their disposal several privileges, in particular blood court jurisdiction (Halsgerichtsbarkeit) at their jurymen's court. Moreover, taxation privileges and laying out economic estates about the town time and again put the townsmen at loggerheads with the lords of the day.
Most inhabitants of course worked at agriculture or market gardening in the Middle Ages and on into early modern times, but they were hardly townsman farmers (Ackerbürger). Westerburg seems much more to have been a craft centre for the surrounding region in which even such rare crafts as arrowsmithing and crossbow making were settled. Also showing this are the many traders' markets held in the town. Several guilds formed in this comparatively small town: in 1581 the bakers' guild, which joined with the brewers' guild in 1657, in 1532 the woolweavers' and clothmakers' guild (dissolved in 1710), in 1574 the tanners' and shoemakers' guild, in 1611 the linen weavers' guild, and by 1658 also the tailors' and merchants'. The woolweavers are known to have had their own hall, "Westerburger Hall" in Frankfurt am Main in 1605. Furthermore, it has been established that there were several mills, a forest smithy, a limekiln (mentioned in 1537) and a brickwork (built in 1612).
The FBI identified the Burke crew as the likely perpetrators within three days of the robbery, largely due to the discovery of the van, coupled with Edwards' pre-established connections with the Burke gang at Robert's Lounge. They set up heavy surveillance, following the gang in helicopters and bugging their vehicles, the phones at Robert's Lounge, and even the payphones nearest to the bar. The FBI managed to record a few bits of tantalizing chatter despite the background sounds of rock and disco music, such as Angelo Sepe telling an unidentified man about "a brown case and a bag from Lufthansa" and his telling his girlfriend Hope Barron, "...I want to see...look where the money's at...dig a hole in the cellar [inaudible] rear lawn..." But this was not enough to definitively connect Burke's crew to the heist, and no search warrants were issued.

Stefano (Lino Capolicchio) arrives in a village of the Valli di Comacchio area where he has been employed to restore a fresco depicting what appears to be the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, which has been painted on a rotting wall of the local church by a mysterious, long-dead artist named Legnani. While temporarily taking up residence in the house that had been previously owned by the two sisters of the deceased painter, Stefano begins a romance with a new, beautiful schoolteacher, Francesca (Francesca Marciano), meanwhile learning from various townspeople that the painter had been a madman who had derived his art from real life. Specifically, Stefano learns that the artist — assisted by his two equally-insane sisters — had been a killer who brutally tortured people to death as inspiration for his horrific paintings — a practice that had likely been used for the very painting he is in process of restoring. As Stefano is discouraged for his task throughout the town, some of the villagers are brutally killed — including his employer — and he comes to suspect that their murderer is trying to deter him from discovering the full truth behind the artist and his ominous legacy within the sleepy community.

One day, when Carl arrived at Gisimba, he saw more than 50 armed militiamen who were waiting for an occasion to kill everyone inside the orphanage. His presence there stopped anyone from being killed. Wilkens decided to sleep with the kids that night to make sure they were safe. He stayed there until, using all his connections, he found four guards to guard the people inside the orphanage. He jumped into his car to find the governor, who could help him to save the orphans. When he was in his office, the Hutu prime minister Jean Kambanda, was there and someone told Wilkens to ask him for help. Wilkens described the situation with these words: "'Ask him?' It's like that's the stupidest thing you could imagine - to ask this guy who is obviously orchestrating the genocide, a key player, and yet I have no other options. … [He's like], 'Just go out in the hallway. He's in the next office. When he comes out, ask him." So I went out [into the hallway] … and [a] door opens. Everybody snaps to attention, and here comes [the prime minister] and his little entourage. They're coming down the hall, and I am, too. I put my hand out and I said, 'Mr. Prime Minister, I'm Carl Wilkens, the director of ADRA.' He stops and he looks at me, and then he takes my hand and shakes it and said, 'Yes, I've heard about you and your work. How is it?' I said, 'Well, honestly, sir, it's not very good right now. The orphans at Gisimba are surrounded, and I think there's going to be a massacre, if there hasn't been already.' He turns around, talks to some of his aides or whatever, [and he turns back to me and] he says, 'We're aware of the situation, and those orphans are going to be safe. I'll see to it.'"
And it worked; the prime minister agreed to make sure that nothing would happen to the orphans. But Wilkens, who was afraid of another militiamen attempt to kill people inside Gisimba, decided to move survivors to a safe haven - the Saint Michel Cathedral. Again, he used his connections and in few days, he organized two buses and a military escort, which was to help them to get through the most dangerous roadblocks. Wilkens negotiated with armed men on the way to the cathedral. In the end, everyone on the buses was transported to Saint Michel alive and unharmed.

The gang soon finds out they are trapped inside of the toy store, because the snowman is waiting for them outside. They then meet the owner, Fabian Menkle, who explains to them about the store's haunted clock tower and that the Menkle family toy store was cursed a long time ago by the Sinister Snowman. Later, the snowman is able to get inside the factory and tries to chase Shaggy and Scooby. Just when they think they are doomed, the real Santa Claus shows up, and gets the haunted clock tower working again, which had not been working for many centuries. The snowman is melted by the loud clock tower, and is found out to be none other than Fabian Menkle himself, who was trying to rob the toy store of its money. He tried to make his uncle look crazy so he could sell the store and get the money.
In August 1878 he returned to Fort Reno shortly before the break-out resulting in the Northern Cheyenne Exodus. Wood was assigned command of a small detachment of Company G, 4th Cavalry and marched north to join the pursuit. His detachment of 20 troopers joined a mixed force of soldiers and cowboys searching for the Cheyenne. On September 21, 1878, at Little Sandy Creek near present-day Ashland, Kansas, Wood led his company in a mounted charge to rescue two wounded cowboys ambushed and trapped in a small canyon. His company became part of a mixed command of cavalry and infantry under Lieut. Col. William Lewis of the 19th Infantry that pursued and caught the Cheyenne in another canyon at Punished Woman's Fork, near present-day Scott City. Lewis attacked on the late afternoon of September 27, 1878, using dismounted cavalry including Wood's company in skirmish lines, and temporarily succeeded in pinning down the Cheyenne in the canyon. Lewis was mortally wounded by a sharpshooter during the engagement and the Cheyenne escaped after dark. For these engagements Wood was brevetted for gallantry in action in 1891.

The division was located near Aprelevka, in the Moscow suburbs: its various subunits occupied a vast complex of buildings and sites to the north and northwest of the town. The two most important 'sub-bases' in the area are Kalininets and Kobyakovo. It was one of the Russian Army's 'constant readiness' divisions, meaning that it was required to have at least 80% manpower and 100% equipment strength at all times; it was thus intended to be readily deployable.

The 1974–75 basketball season was a disappointment to Williams and his team. He managed to score only 9.4 points per game for the Spirits. Williams' scoring was erratic and he was known for his showmanship rather than his scoring proficiency. He did not play during the following year (1975–76), after which the Spirits of St. Louis were one of two teams, along with the Kentucky Colonels, to fold as a result of the ABA-NBA merger, and Williams ended up without a team despite some interest in retaining him in the league. He was subsequently selected by the Philadelphia 76ers in the ninth round (152nd overall) of the 1976 NBA Draft but the team did not sign him.

Carrying on the head is common in many parts of the developing world, as only a simple length of cloth shaped into a ring or ball is needed to carry loads approaching the person's own weight. The practice is efficient, in a place or at a time when there are no vehicles or beasts of burden available for transporting the objects. Today, women and men may be seen carrying burdens on top of their heads where there is no less expensive, or more efficient, way of transporting workloads. In India, women carry baskets of bricks to workmen on construction sites. It is also used by the lowest caste to carry away human waste that they scoop out of pit latrines, the practice of manual scavenging.
African-American women continued the practice during the 19th century, which they learned from their elders who had been enslaved from Africa. One observer during the American Civil War noted seeing the impressive sense of balance and dexterity that the practice gave women in South Carolina: "I have seen a woman, with a brimming water-pail balanced on her head, or perhaps a cup, saucer, and spoon, stop suddenly, turn round, stoop to pick up a missile, rise again, fling it, light a pipe, and go through many revolutions with either hand or both, without spilling a drop". Until the turn of the 20th century, African-American women in the Southern states continued carrying baskets and bundles of folded clothes on top of their heads, when they found work as washerwomen (laundresses), doing laundry for white employers. This practice ended when the automobile became common in affluent communities, and employers began delivering the clothing to the homes of the washerwomen, rather than the workers walking to the employers' homes.
The owners of the quarry were paternalistic in nature: At the joint expense of the new owner William Perry Herrick, and the leaseholders, (the Ellis' and Breedon Everard), cottages and a school were built for the quarry's workmen and their families, in the village of Bardon. In 1898 a new parish church was built, and a stipend provided to pay for a clergyman. The architect of the church, school and houses was Breedon Everard's second son, John Breedon Everard, who had joined the Ellis and Everard firm in 1874. The quarry and its owners offered 'ambitious opportunities for upward social mobility' that were unusual for the time: a quarry labourer on living in one of the cottages in 1881 was a teacher; within the quarry, uneducated labourers rose to positions of high management.

Lexington continued to support army operations in the Tennessee River until steaming down the Mississippi with Conestoga, , and to enter the White River, 14 June. While the Union gunboats, were capturing St. Charles, Arkansas, 17 June a direct hit exploded Mound Citys steam drum scalding many of her men. The injured crewmen were treated on Lexington as she pushed 63 miles further upriver to Crooked Point Cut-off where shallow water forced her to turn back. The gunboat then returned to the Mississippi to protect army transports from guerilla bands which attacked from the river banks.
Somewhere in the deserts of the United States there was a reactor in which experiments were conducted on pieces of kryptonite. When a powerful nuclear meltdown happened, Superman himself was there to attempt to stop it. He failed, however, and a powerful kryptonite-based explosion that rendered Superman unconscious resulted. Although he apparently had succeeded in stopping most of the deadly radiation from reaching humanity, a strange fission wave reached around the world and changed all kryptonite into pure iron. Miraculously, it seemed, Superman now had no vulnerabilities anymore, a fact that was told in newspapers worldwide.
During one of these encounters, it saved the life of Superman by destroying the magic weapon called the Devil's Harp, an artifact that was being used by a man named Ferlin Nyxly a.k.a. Pan. Pan had nearly killed Superman when the Sand Superman sneaked by and destroyed the weapon that had allowed Pan to steal all of Superman's powers. Reasonably, the Sand Superman saved Superman's life in order to maintain its own existence (it had a life-giving mental link to Superman and thus it could not survive without Superman being alive). Later it gained the ability to speak, but that did not help Superman much. The being did not follow human emotions and did not care for humanity; thus Superman could not convince it to agree on anything.
The punks were, however, too bullying and the enraged monster killed both of them, crushing them in its hands. The monster still wanted to finish Superman (to which he also seemed to have a mental link), but by the time it reached the hospital, Superman awoke re-powered. The Sand Superman showed up and teamed with Superman. Together they both attacked the monster who, terrified, escaped back to the park and left Earth via the dimensional portal. Alone again with Superman, the Sand Superman announced that he was going to kill Superman so that he could be the only Man of Steel (see Quote). I Ching, fortunately, arrived on the scene and magically hypnotized both into seeing how a fight between the two might turn out. Both saw the fight destroying Earth and Superman, believing that he had really destroyed Earth, was devastated. The Sand Superman realized that it had no right to claim Superman's body or soul and thus agreed to return home to Quarrm. It left through the portage with half of Superman's powers (Superman refused to take the other half back after having seen the destruction of Earth during the hypnotism) and closed the portal from the Quarrm side.
The Sand Superman resembled Superman himself more and more the more power it absorbed. At first it was a pile of sand with humanoid features, but near the end it had acquired colors in its densely packed sand so that it really resembled Superman. The only real difference was that the Sand Superman had a very different and alien body language and that his skin and suit resembled rough sandpaper. Everywhere Superman had colors in his suit, it had too; it even had blue eyes of blue sand and black sand for hair. The entire appearance was quite uncanny and people who saw it often commented how strange 'Superman' looked. All in all, it had the exact appearance of Superman himself, but with a very sand-like composition.

Ptah (, reconstructed ; ; ; Phoenician: 𐤐𐤕𐤇, romanized: ptḥ) is an ancient Egyptian deity, a creator god and patron of craftsmen and architects. In the triad of Memphis, he is the husband of Sekhmet and the father of Nefertem. He was also regarded as the father of the sage Imhotep.
In the New Kingdom, the cult of the god would develop in different ways, especially in Memphis, his homeland, but also in Thebes, where the workers of the royal tombs honoured him as patron of craftsmen. For this reason, the oratory of Ptah who listens to prayers was built near the site of Deir el-Medina, the village where the workers and craftsmen were housed. At Memphis, the role of intercessor with humans was particularly visible in the appearance of the enclosure that protected the sanctuary of the god. Large ears were carved on the walls, symbolizing his role as god who listens to prayers.

As the first volume of Stratford land records were destroyed in 1650, early records of English settlement are not available. In 1661, the Stratford selectmen voted to allow all inhabitants the liberty of taking up a whole division of land anywhere they could find fit planting ground, as long as it was not within two miles (3 km) of the town meeting house. They were prohibited from making it their dwelling place without consent. Elder Phillip Groves, Captain William Curtiss and Lt. Joseph Judson, early landowners in Nichols, were named to a committee to lay out the land as they saw fit.

In 2014, a controversial lawsuit was launched by a midwife Ellinor Grimmark against the health authorities in Jönköping region because they refused to provide her with a job as she would not carry out abortions or prescribe contraceptives due to her religious beliefs. The case had financial support from a well-known Christian anti-abortion organisation in the US, Alliance Defending Freedom, which has interests in limiting abortion access in Europe. Grimmark's case was tried by the discrimination ombudsman as well as a district court in Sweden, both of which ruled against her.

Born in Ath in Southern Netherlands (now in Belgium), he soon moved to the nearby town of Tournai to practice his trade. Little is known of his training but a remarkable number of his instruments have survived. His building style is quite contrary to his more famous contemporaries, like his neighbours Dulckens in Antwerp, the Hass family in Hamburg or the Taskins of Paris, that at the time created complex machines with an extensive variety of registers and knee levers. Delin's surviving instruments are simple, reminiscent of the old Ruckers instruments of a century before and of good workmanship as witnessed by the number of surviving instruments.

Between 1561 and 1729, Plön was the capital of the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön. The Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Plön emerged in 1622 as a result of succession in the Danish royal house. From 1633 to 1636 a Renaissance castle was built on the site of the old castle by Duke Joachim Ernest, and Plön became the capital of the small but independent princedom. As a residence town Plön experienced a considerable increase in status. For example, in 1685 Duke John Adolphus ("Hans Adolf") founded the new town (Neustadt) northwest of the town in order to settle craftsmen here and thus increase the economic might of the duchy. Under Charles Frederick the castle district was expanded with several baroque buildings and a pleasure garden. At that time the town had about 1,000 inhabitants and reached as far as the bridge over the Schwentine in the east and as far as the end of today's pedestrian zone in the west. Both entrances were protected by gates.

The Archduke agreed and saw the acquisition of Amiens as compensation for the recent defeat at Turnhout in Brabant by Anglo-Dutch forces led by Maurice of Nassau earlier in the year. He assigned 7,000 infantry and 700 cavalry to Governor Porto Carrero. The plan was to hide 500 infantry and horsemen in small groups close to the city. The Governor sent sixteen men dressed as peasants into the city and divided them into three groups.

For the story of a nobleman holding a castle at his lady's behest Hogg was drawing on accounts of the defence of Castle Douglas by Sir John Webiton, or Walton, against Sir James Douglas. The tale was originally told by John Barbour (d. 1395) in The Brus and then by David Hume of Godscroft in The History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus (1644). In Hogg's own time it appears in a note to The Lord of the Isles (1815) by Walter Scott, and in the same author's essay on 'Chivalry' in the 1818 supplement of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Hogg also draws on The Brus for an episode actually involving Roxburgh castle, in attacking which Sir James Douglas and his men are taken for cattle.

The main point of contention in the umpiring of the 1974–75 Ashes series was the intimidatory bowling of the Australian fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. There were a few other issues, though there were the usual cases of batsmen being given out or not out despite the differing opinions of the players and umpire. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to make decisions based on what they saw in a split second, with the benefit of the doubt always going to the batsman. As a result it was not uncommon for umpires to make mistakes, which over the course of a long series tended to cancel each other out. The best an umpire could do was to make an honest judgement based on what he saw. Tom Brooks and Robin Bailhache were the umpires in all six Tests, but were junior for so important a series. Brooks having made his debut in the 1970–71 Ashes series and Bailhache in the First Test at Brisbane. Unusually for Australian umpires of the time Brooks had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game. This helped England in 1970–71 when they had the fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis, but proved fatal for their batsmen in 1974–75.
The England team thought that the Australian umpires failed to apply Law 46; 'the persistent bowling of fast short-pitched balls at the batsman is unfair if, in the opinion of the umpire at the bowler's end, it constitutes a systematic attempt at intimidation'. Wisden noted that "never in the 98 years of Test cricket have batsmen been so grievously bruised and battered by ferocious, hostile, short-pitched balls". Both Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had written and stated that they liked to bowl bouncers to intimidate batsmen, with Thomson's 'blood on the wicket' statement particularly offending old-fashioned sensibilities. Traditionally it was the job of the captain to restrain his bowlers if they became too aggressive, but Ian Chappell refused to do so and the Australian umpires were loath to give them official warnings. It is rare in Test cricket for an umpire to give a bowler an official warning or to ban him, and in Sydney the crowd would not have accepted such a move. To be fair the England fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis had bowled short and fast on the previous tour and Chappell "employed almost the identical tactics used by Illingworth and Snow in 1970-71" when the tourists had complained about Umpire Rowan's interference. Willis returned to bowl short in 1974-75, but was injury prone and not as fast as either Lillee or Thomson. It was possible for umpires to curb even a fast bowler like Lillee, as Dickie Bird was to demonstrate in England, but Brooks and Bailhache were relatively inexperienced and lacked authority. They also lacked the backing of the Australia Board of Control who enjoyed record profits from the series thanks to the crowd-drawing qualities of the bowlers. Keith Fletcher had his arm bruised by Thomson in the First Test and Dennis Amiss and John Edrich their hands bruised from being constantly hit with short balls. Wally Edwards was hit by a Willis bouncer in the Second Test, Colin Cowdrey on the arm by Lillee and David Lloyd painfully in the groin by Thomson. The Third Test had Fred Titmus struck a blow to the back of the knee from a ball by Thomson. In the Fourth Test Tony Greig hit Lillee on the elbow and Ashley Mallett on his bowling hand with his medium paced bouncers, John Edrich had his ribs broken when he ducked into a Lillee bouncer that kept low and Fletcher was hit on the head. In the Sixth Test Greg Chappell was struck on the chin by Peter Lever. Edrich (twice), Amiss and Lloyd were all dropped from Tests due to the severity of their injuries.
At 3:30pm two umpires emerged from the players' race leading from the dressing rooms. The crowd roared its approval. It seemed there was going to be more play. The cordon of policemen, reinforced after the spectator intrusions of the first day, respectfully made way to allow the umpires to pass. But wait! Surely Tom Brooks does not have a beard. Robin Bailhache, slight in build though he is, is slightly more substantial than the youthful beanpole figure making his way to the centre. It took Bill Watkins, the groundsman at the M.C.G. to detect the impersonation. He hurried from his post by the covers in the centre of the ground to intercept the impostors and turn them back from whence they came. In tribute to a skillful piece of improvised humour, police sergeant Brian Watkins allowed them to make good their escape, instead of conducting them to the local lock-up.
The Australian umpires were willing to give the batsmen the benefit of bad light if there was a thunderstorm in the offing, or the Australian sunset came too soon and were particularly prone to do this if Lillee, Thomson or Willis were bowling. In the second innings of the First Test at Brisbane there were 35 minutes for England to bat until stumps, but as a stormcloud loomed over the ground and Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were sending down three short balls an over. Bailhache told them they should bowl fuller, but the next ball was a Thommo bouncer and the umpire gave the English batsmen the benefit of the bad light. The Australian captain Ian Chappell complained about the umpire's interference as strictly speaking he could not tell the bowlers what to bowl and the ABC commentator Frank Tyson agreed. In the Third Test at Melbourne a couple of hoaxers dressed up as umpires during bad light and "sold the crowd a pup" before they were chased off.
Walker stole a single to mid-off and with his eye fixed exclusively on the swooping fieldsman, Denness, hurtled blindly towards the bowler's wicket. Umpire Brooks, too, was concentrating on the ball and fieldsman whilst moving towards the off side and was skittled by the batsman who flung himself in the direction of safety with little or no consideration for the safety of others. Walker beat Denness's return to the wicket, but at the cost of a collision between the immovable mass and the irresistible force. Umpire Brooks, having been a first class bowler in his day was a man of some substance, and pound for pound was a good match for the burly Walker. Umpire and bowler toppled slowly to the ground and...resumed their upright position slowly...
In the Third Test at Melbourne Tony Greig was controversially run out when England were 157/6. Ian Chappell had thrown the ball in from the boundary as Greig was completing his third run and Marsh caught the ball and smashed the stumps as the 6'7" South African reached for the crease with his long handled bat. Photographs later showed that he had just made his ground, but Bailhache gave him out and Greig refused to go until rudely told to leave by Greg Chappell. In the Fifth Test at the Adelaide Oval Max Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to end up at the same end as Lillee as Mike Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pickup. Lillee tried to walk to keep Walker in as he was the better batsman, but Dennis Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go as Lillee has not left his ground and the umpire agreed. Walker had trouble again (see the above quote) in the Sixth Test at Melbourne: the burly Tasmanian ran straight into Umpire Brooks trying to avoid a run out that sent both to the ground, but Walker survived with his wicket intact. In the Third Test at Melbourne John Edrich tried to glance a ball from Ashley Mallett and was caught by Rod Marsh for 49. Bailhache gave him out, though the batsmen later said he had missed and the ball had come off his pads.
Different nations and militaries will vary the rule of thirds according to their own financial and manpower situations.
At times of financial constraint, rather than increasing the total number of forces, one temptation of politicians is to attempt to increase available manpower by folding together the preparation and recuperation phases, creating a rule of halves. A rule of halves was actually the basis of British Army planning during the British Empire, with each regiment consisting of a pair of battalions which would take turns recruiting, training and recuperating in the UK, and then being deployed overseas. However, because of the nature of transportation in the past, each of the phases at that time were longer (being a year or more) than is currently the case. Departing from a three-phase rotation for short periods is not impossible, but prolonged deployment is detrimental both to the psychological health of service personnel, and to the operational life of equipment, leading to an unwanted turnover in personnel, and to premature failure of equipment. For those military operations that are able to afford it, going to a four- or five-phase rotation schedule actually increases a nation's ability to conduct sustained military operations, even though it may appear that the majority of its servicemen are not doing anything.
The United States, in order to keep the maximum number of its submarines available at any one time, assigns two crews, called gold and blue, to each of its submarines, with the submarines themselves having a turnaround time that is as short as possible. However, the United States is one of the few nations that can afford both the manpower costs of doing this, while still being able to ensure that enough boats are in service to have the ability regularly to stagger boats out for deep maintenance without appreciably affecting the total number available.

On September 29, 1879, a group of Ute warriors, led by Chief Colorow ambushed a group of around 175 soldiers and militiamen from Fort Steele near Milk Creek. At the same time, the Utes also killed the Indian agent and his white employees at the Ute reservation nearby. The troops near the creek created a perimeter around their wagons with dead animals while their remaining animals were picked off by the Utes. Captain Francis Dodge, Sergeant Johnson, and D Troop arrived on October 2, 1879, and were able to enter the encampment without being shot at. For the next three days, D Troop's animals were picked off, leaving only four wounded horses. Johnson was charged with the responsibility of securing the outposts for the defense for the encampment, and under heavy fire from the Utes, made the rounds to meet with his men. On October 5, five troops from the 5th Cavalry arrived shortly after the Ute attackers dispersed.
The settlement of the area that became known as Nossa Senhora da Conceição was first attributed to the Flemish nobleman Joss van Aard (which was later transliterated into Portuguese as José da Terra, literally Joseph of the Earth/Land), where he made his home, cultivated a small parcel, and planted fruit trees on the edge of Ribeira dos Flamengos (Ravine of the Flemings):

His grandfather, Zuta, may have been captured by Muslim troops in Kabul and sold as a slave in Kufa. There, he was purchased and freed by an Arab tribesman of the Taym Allah, a branch of the Banu Bakr. Zuta and his progeny thereafter became clients (mawali) of the Taym Allah, hence the sporadic references to Abu Hanifa as 'al-Taymi' (i.e. 'of the Taym Allah'). It is otherwise held that his family emigrated from Charikar north of Kabul to Baghdad in the eighth century. The Indian scholar Qazi Athar Mubarakpuri reports from the grandson of Abu Hanifa, who said, "By God, our family was never a slave to anyone and my grandfather Numan was born in 80 AH." Athar also suggests that Zuta had embraced Islam during the reign of Ali and was named Numan.

The Prussian Navy ordered Friedrich Carl from a French shipbuilder in 1865. She was laid down at the Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers La Seyne shipyard in Toulon the following year. The ship was launched on 16 January 1867; fitting out work was completed rapidly, and the ship was completed before the end of the year. Friedrich Carl was delivered to Prussia in October 1867 and commissioned into the fleet on the 3rd of the month. Crews for Friedrich Carl and Kronprinz were carried to the ships by the screw frigate and the screw corvette . Both ironclads were laid up without any armament on entering service, as the new guns that had been intended to have been installed suffered serious failures during testing in 1867–1868; the Kreiner breech blocks proved to be prone to failure and so Krupp-designed guns were installed instead, with the work completed by July 1869. in June 1870, Friedrich Carl collided with the Danish schooner Auguste Robert in the Dogger Bank. The schooner was abandoned; Dutch fishermen rescued her crew.

That evening, Svetlana initially joined the and under the overall command of Vice Admiral Oskar Enkvist in an attempt to evade the Japanese fleet and to flee to Manila. However, unable to match the speed of the more modern Russian cruisers, Svetlana then attempted to sail north for Vladivostok in the company of the destroyer Bystry. The pursuing Japanese caught up at daybreak close to the Korean coast, and Bystry was run aground, where her 82 crewmen (including 10 men rescued from ) were captured.
At 0930 hours, the Japanese cruisers and , along with the destroyer had closed to within gunnery range of Svetlana. By 1035, Svetlana was on fire, and began to sink at 1050.

William Fortnum was a footman in the household of Queen Anne. The royal family's insistence on having new candles every night resulted in large amounts of half-used wax, which Fortnum promptly resold. Fortnum also had a side business as a grocer. He convinced his landlord, Hugh Mason, to be his associate, and they founded the first Fortnum & Mason store in Mason's small shop in St James's Market in 1707. In 1761, William Fortnum's grandson Charles went into the service of Queen Charlotte, and the connection with the royal court led to an increase in business. Fortnum & Mason claims to have invented the Scotch egg, in 1738. The store began to stock speciality items, namely ready-to-eat luxury meals such as poultry or game served in aspic jelly.
In the 1994 film, The Madness of King George, set in the late 1780s, a footman named Fortnum leaves in a huff to "set up a tea emporium". Thius is an anachronistic reference to the founding of the store, as William Fortnum's position as a footman in the royal household of Queen Anne was many decades earlier.

His claim to the surname , referring to the Byzantine Komnenos dynasty, first appears in this document, but it apparently reflects a well-established tradition: in his , the Florentine historian Gioacchino Cambiagi devoted an entire chapter (Vol. XII, pp. 287–312) to the family's descent from Alexios I Komnenos, and its subsequent history, drawn in part from oral accounts of the Greeks of Corsica.

He would have gained thrice the salary as solely a professional footballer than he did as a banker-cum-amateur footballer, but he was (in his own words) "by no means mad about football".

Kaykaus' most significant contribution to the Seljuq state was the acquisition the Black Sea port of Sinop. In 1214 Turkmen tribesmen captured Alexios, Grand Komnenos of the Empire of Trebizond, on a hunting trip outside of the city.

On 28 October 1940, Italy declared war on Greece, expecting a swift victory but the invasion failed and the Italians were pushed back into Albania. As the war dragged on, on 6 April 1941 Germany was forced to intervene to support its struggling ally. The small Greek force defending the Metaxas Line on the Greco–Bulgarian border was defeated by the better equipped and numerically superior Germans. The German penetration deep into Greece made further resistance at the Albanian front pointless, ending the Battle of Greece in the favor of the Axis Powers. Greece was subjected to a triple occupation by Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. Unlike Italy and Germany, Bulgaria did not administer eastern Macedonia and the parts of Western Thrace it controlled through Greek collaborators, but annexed the area to form the province of Belomorie. The Bulgarian language was made compulsory in all administrative matters, as well as in the education and liturgy. Businessmen were forced to accept Bulgarian partners or even hand their property over to Bulgarian control. Efforts to promote Bulgarisation were also enacted in the German-controlled Greek Macedonia, through the creation of Bulgarian clubs in all major towns. The first resistance organization in northern Greece was founded in May 1941; Eleutheria (Liberty) united people from across the political spectrum ranging from communists to Venizelists. The group was short-lived, as internal political disagreements and the work of Axis intelligence services suppressed its activities, but bands belonging to the Communist-led National Liberation Front (EAM) and its Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), continued to emerge in the region.

Following Japan's entry into the war in December 1941, the battalion was mobilised for war service. In early 1942, when concerns about a Japanese invasion of Australia heightened, the battalion, consisting of 44 officers and 890 other ranks, was moved to Jimboomba, in Queensland, from Bonegilla. The invasion did not eventuate and the government decided to demobilise part of the military to rectify a manpower shortage that developed in the Australian economy. As a result, on 27 August 1942, the 52nd Battalion was once again amalgamated with the 37th Battalion to form the 37th/52nd Battalion, and some of its personnel were released back to civilian industry. The 10th Brigade was disbanded around this time, and subsequently the 37th/52nd Battalion was assigned to the 4th Brigade. Together the amalgamated battalion subsequently served in the Huon Peninsula and New Britain campaigns in 1944 and 1945 before being disbanded on 12 June 1946.

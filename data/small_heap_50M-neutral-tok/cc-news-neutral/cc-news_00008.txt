WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- Senior House Democrats on Monday extolled the benefits of President Barack Obama 's health care law in hopes of derailing Republican plans to gut the statute and over time replace it .
In a conference call with reporters , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the GOP will begin its `` assault '' on the health care law when the 115th Congress convenes Tuesday . They said abolishing the law , known as the Affordable Care Act , as Republicans have promised will mean that people will pay more for their health insurance while getting much less than they do now . Undoing the law also will undermine Medicaid and Medicare , they said .
Currently Republicans plan to vote quickly on repealing the health care law and delay the effective date to give them time to craft a replacement . Pelosi blasted that strategy as `` an act of cowardice . '' They urged people to `` take a second look '' at how the health care law has improved their lives .
Minority Whip Steny Hoyer , the No . 2 Democrat in the House , said they believe that many people who voted for President-elect Donald Trump want the health care law preserved even though Trump made repeal of the statute a central part of their campaign .
`` I think a lot of people are going to be looking at this and saying , 'Gee , I really did n't mean that , ' '' Hoyer said .
Republicans have opposed Obama 's law since Democrats steered the law through Congress in 2010 . The GOP has tried numerous times to repeal the law but failed due to internal divisions and Obama 's veto power . But with the GOP in control of the House and Senate and Donald Trump set to become president in a few weeks , doing away with `` Obamacare '' is in sight for Republicans .
GOP lawmakers are expected to spend the next several months working on legislation to cancel broad swaths of the law that the party 's voter base staunchly opposes . Most likely to go are the law 's mandate that people buy health insurance or face hefty IRS fines , and its expansion of Medicaid coverage to more lower-earning Americans . But several elements of the repeal likely would n't go into effect for two to four years .
Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey , the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee , said Republicans are `` blind to the success '' of the health care law . Repealing the law is rooted in politics , they said , and will hurt middle class Americans .
`` Repealing the Affordable Care Act is not logical ; it 's simply ideological , '' Pallone said .

TAIPEI ( CNA ) - The Mainland Affairs Council ( MAC ) confirmed late Wednesday a report by the Hong Kong Free Press ( HKFP ) that a Chinese human rights activist seeking political asylum has been allowed into Taiwan for a three-month stay .
According to the HKFP , an online newspaper , activist Huang Yan ( 黃燕 ) , who has been granted refugee status by the United Nations , arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 8:40 p.m. the day before from Jakarta , Indonesia .
Due to Taiwan 's lack of a refugee law , the report continued , Huang had to remain at the airport and was facing the threat of being deported back to China , where they face persecution , until the Taiwanese authorities made the decision to grant them temporary protection .
MAC Vice Minister and spokesperson Chiu Chui-cheng ( 邱垂正 ) substantiated the report in an interview with CNA , saying that the government approved their stay due to considerations that they could face persecution if returned to China .
The National Immigration Agency 's joint review committee examined their case and , taking into account their U.N. status as a refugee and the danger they could face in China , granted them a three-month stay , Chiu noted .
Once the temporary stay period concludes , Huang will have to resettle in another country , they concluded .
Huang has been subject to detentions , house arrest and brutality at the hands of state agents due to their involvement in campaigns demanding freedom for activists and lawyers detained in China , the HKFP reported .

ATHENS , Greece ( AP ) — A United Nations mediator is visiting Athens amid redoubled efforts to end a quarter-century dispute between Greece and neighboring Macedonia over Macedonia 's name .
Matthew Nimetz will meet Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias Tuesday , and will later travel to Skopje for talks with Macedonian officials .
The dispute broke out after Macedonia , for decades a part of the former Yugoslavia , gained independence in 1991 . Greece objects to its use of the name Macedonia , arguing that this implies territorial claims on its own adjoining province , also called Macedonia .
Officials in Skopje counter that their part of the world has been known as Macedonia for a long time .
The squabble has prevented Macedonia from joining NATO , to which Greece already belongs . The two countries ' governments have pledged to seek a solution this year .

NEW CONCORD , Ohio ( AP ) — At age 87 , Norman Stout may not have a lot of time left to see the execution of the man who killed their wife more than three decades ago . He 's determined to be there if possible .
`` I want to make damn sure that it finally is accomplished , '' Stout said .
The state of Ohio wants the execution to happen , as well , and says it finally has the means to put condemned killer John Stumpf to death after years of trying to obtain lethal drugs .
Whether that three-drug combination is constitutional is before a federal appeals court whose ruling will help decide whether Stumpf 's execution — now scheduled for November of next year — can take place at last .
Stumpf was sentenced to die in 1984 for the slaying of Mary Jane Stout , shot four times at the couple 's home outside of New Concord in eastern Ohio , about 70 miles ( 110 kilometers ) east of Columbus .
Of the more than two dozen Ohio inmates with active execution dates , Stumpf has been on death row the longest — more than 12,000 days . Six presidents have served . More than 30 new countries have come into existence . The population of the U.S. has grown by a third .
Stumpf 's situation is not unique . Six Alabama inmates have been on death row more than 30 years , including one inmate who arrived there in 1979 . Texas houses more than a dozen inmates whose capital crimes occurred more than three decades ago . Arkansas Gov . Asa Hutchinson cited long delays faced by victims ' families when they pushed for eight executions in 11 days in April . Ultimately , four men were put to death .
As has been the case elsewhere , court appeals and Ohio 's struggle to find lethal drugs have helped delay Stumpf 's execution . That includes a reprieve from Gov . John Kasich in May when they moved Stumpf 's execution from January of next year to November to allow more time for legal arguments over Ohio 's new lethal injection process .
The 6th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati heard arguments Wednesday for and against that process and is expected to rule soon . Ohio 's first execution in more than three years is set for late next month .
Seemingly endless appeals and roller-coaster rulings are a hallmark of death sentences in the U.S. , frustrating proponents who say capital punishment moves far too slowly to ensure justice . But , opponents argue , those same appeals protect suspects ' constitutional rights and sometimes free the innocent .
Complicating matters , drugmakers and distributors have put the drugs used for decades off limits , setting off a scramble to find alternatives and often delaying executions while they search and argue in the courts .
At issue in Ohio is the effectiveness of the first drug in the state 's three-drug method , a sedative called midazolam that has been used in problematic executions in Arizona , Arkansas and Ohio in which inmates did n't appear fully sedated before the second and third drugs took effect .
`` More politics , '' said Norman Stout , recalling their reaction when they heard of the latest delay .
Stout is waiting for a conclusion to the events of May 14 , 1984 , which they recall as if they happened yesterday . They and their wife , Mary Jane , had just finished dinner when two men came to the door asking if they could use the phone . Once inside , they announced a robbery . As Stumpf held the couple at gunpoint , Clyde Wesley ransacked the house , according to court records .
When Norman Stout made a move toward Stumpf , the gunman shot them twice in the head . Five fragments of lead remain beneath their skin .
After Stout regained consciousness , they heard two male voices in the next room , then the four shots that killed their wife . Stumpf , sentenced to death by a three-judge panel , has always maintained Wesley shot Mary Jane Stout .
Wesley is serving 35 years to life . The driver of the car that day , Norman Edmonds , served about 10 years before being paroled to their home state of Texas .
At Wesley 's trial , prosecutors argued Wesley shot Mary Jane Stout , while Wesley testified it was Stumpf . Wesley received a life sentence with parole eligibility ; their next hearing is in 2027 .
Over the years , courts upheld and later rejected Stumpf 's argument that it was improper for prosecutors to argue that Stumpf shot Mary Jane Stout yet contend at a separate trial that Wesley was the triggerman .
Stumpf , now 56 , has no current appeals pending , said David Stebbins , their public defender , who declined to comment further .
Norman Stout met their wife while stationed at the now-closed Sampson Air Force Base in western New York state . After a teaching stint in Rochester , the couple moved to Ohio , where Norman Stout was a heavy equipment operator until the shooting .
Mary Jane Stout was an avid collector of Holly Hobbie memorabilia . Norman Stout expanded their collection in their honor and now maintains a gallery in New Concord full of hundreds of Holly Hobbie figurines , plates , greeting cards , puzzles and board games .
Showing a visitor around , Norman Stout speaks evenhandedly of their shooting and their wife 's death . But it 's clear they have little sympathy for arguments about the risk of execution to Stumpf .
`` I ca n't imagine the pain that my wife went through when they were shot , '' they said . `` I want them to feel some pain . ''

After a brief cold snap moved into the region last week , temperatures have been about 20 degrees above normal , according to the National Weather Service . Grand Forks ' high went from 2 degrees last Wednesday to 22 on Thursday and 38 on Friday , a 36-degree jump in two days . Highs have lingered in the high 30s this week and are expected to climb into the low and mid-40s by the weekend , according to the National Weather Service .
`` We have gotten into the 44 to 51 range for this week of February , '' NWS meteorologist Pete Speicher said of past weather readings . `` We 've been as warm as 51 back in 2000 . It 's not totally uncommon , but it 's still well above seasonal norms . ''
An extended outlook from NWS favors above-normal temperatures next week for most of the country except for the West Coast and Alaska . Northwest Minnesota and northeast North Dakota have a 70 to 90 percent chance of seeing unseasonably warm weather .
Records possible
Some cities have a shot of setting record highs . The lowest record high for next week was set Feb. 19 , 2016 , at the Grand Forks International Airport with 44 degrees .
`` That would be the easiest to break , '' Speicher said , adding the forecast for Sunday is 45 degrees .
No high records have been set in February so far this year .
Above-freezing temperatures could be good news for southern and western parts of North Dakota . The warm weather should speed up snowmelt , helping to remove excess moisture from river basins along watersheds .
Fields in the southern part of the Red River Valley have little snow compared with the Red River of the North starting near Hillsboro .
Paths could open up as the snow melts , taking the excess water to rivers , streams and lakes . Areas should be on the lookout for rising water levels , but but the melt taking off that excess water from snowpack slowly could help alleviate flooding in the spring , according to the NWS . Less snow could mean less moisture that could flow over the plains .
`` Anything helps , '' Speicher said . `` It definitely helps that we are going back below freezing at night because that slows the flow rate down . ''
Devils Lake Basin
To the west , Devils Lake could see above-freezing temperatures today and into the weekend , with some days going above 40 degrees .
A slow melt ca n't hurt the Devils Lake Basin , said Jeff Frith , manager of the Devils lake Basin Joint Water Resource Board . The region surrounding the 150,000-acre lake likely will see major flooding due to heavy snow and saturated soil from a wet summer and fall . NWS meteorologists predict a 2- to 4-foot rise with record runoff and possibly elevations .
There still is a lot of winter left and potential for more snow , though Devils Lake has been lucky since snowfall has been relatively low for moisture accumulation in January and into mid-February , they said .
`` A long , slow melt would be just what the doctor ordered , but I think we have way too much winter left to start getting really excited about spring , '' Frith said .
NWS meteorologists were assessing snowpack and other factors that will play a role in predicting flood outlooks . The agency 's second spring flood outlook is due Thursday , though Frith does n't expect much to change since the last one was released almost three weeks ago .
The Midwest likely will see more precipitation than normal in February , and that trend should continue into April , according to NWS . There is no precipitation forecast for this week , though there is a 50 percent chance of next week being wetter than normal .
Overall , February for almost all of the U.S. should be warmer than normal . Colder-than-normal temperatures could return by the end of February and into early March , NWS meteorologists predict .
RALEIGH , N.C. ( AP ) — North Carolina regulators are discussing tests to measure how much of a little-studied industrial compound may have gotten into backyard garden vegetables near a plant that 's been producing that and similar chemicals for decades , a state environmental official said Monday .
State agencies are discussing how to structure any test of vegetable gardens near The Chemours Co. plant near Fayetteville , state waste management director Michael Scott told a scientific advisory panel . The talks come after Dutch researchers recently reported finding GenX and some older , related chemicals in vegetables near one of the company 's factories in the Netherlands .
The Dutch study released earlier this month concluded that the chemicals released into the air were found in about 40 percent of the food samples collected within about 2 ½ miles ( 4 kilometers ) of the European factory . The report concluded that garden crops were safe to eat , but the national public health institute advised people living closest to the plant to limit how much they consumed .
GenX and related chemicals also have been made for years at the Fayetteville complex .
The inter-agency discussions in North Carolina have n't yet concluded whether to test nearby gardens or how any test would be conducted . The talks came in response to neighbors wanting answers about their potential health risks from plants , fish and venison , Scott said . Later steps could lead to further testing of commercial agricultural production .
`` Our focus has been on the home gardens , at least initially , '' Scott told the board , which is studying ways to protect public health from new and emerging chemicals , including GenX and hexavalent chromium .
Tests on fish collected from waterways near both the North Carolina and Dutch Chemours plants should be available within a couple of months , they said .
GenX has been used since 2009 . It replaced perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA — a chemical that was shown to stay in the body longer and which was blamed for increased cancer risks . Both compounds were used in making non-stick Teflon and other materials .
Studies point to GenX and related chemicals as having toxic effects in animals , but its effects in humans are n't known . There are no federal health standards for GenX and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies it as an `` emerging contaminant '' to be studied .
Spokesmen for Wilmington , Delaware-based Chemours did not respond to a request to comment .
Michael Watters said he 's quit eating any of the wide variety of fruits and vegetables they grow on their five-acre lot about a mile ( .6 kilometers ) from the Chemours plant . Tests of their well water found GenX and more than a dozen other chemicals , and something they ca n't explain has forced them to replace spouts on their shower and bathtub twice in nine months , they said .
`` Something 's really gone weird in the water , '' they said .
Lack of information about GenX , its prevalence and health effects has disturbed people across eastern North Carolina . The chemical was detected in the treated drinking water for about 200,000 people in Wilmington , about 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) downstream from the plant along the Cape Fear River .

LGBTQ rights groups slammed Attorney General Jeff Sessions for rescinding an Obama era directive that protected transgender government workers from discrimination .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions came under fire from a number of LGBTQ rights groups Thursday after they determined that federal civil rights legislation does not protect transgender people from discrimination in the workplace .
In a directive distributed to federal prosecutors , Sessions stated that the Justice Department would roll back 2014 guidance issued under the Obama administration that interpreted Title VII , which prohibits employment discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex and national origin , to protect trans government employees .
“ Title VII 's prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination between men and women , ” Sessions said in the memo , which was obtained by BuzzFeed , CNN and USA Today , “ but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se , including transgender status . ”
“ This is a conclusion of law , not policy , ” Sessions said . The department , they added , will take this new position in all “ pending and future matters . ”
Justice Department spokesperson Devin O'Malley doubled down on Sessions ' remarks Thursday . “ Unfortunately , the last administration abandoned that fundamental principle , which necessitated today 's action , ” they told USA Today . “ This department remains committed to protecting the civil and constitutional rights of all individuals , and will continue to enforce the numerous laws that Congress has enacted that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation . ”
Not surprisingly , LGBTQ rights groups deemed the news an “ outright attack ” on the trans community , which has already suffered a number of troubling setbacks under President Donald Trump .
GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis argued that Sessions had been “ working according to their own ideology and not actual justice ” when issuing the directive . The attorney general , they added in a statement , “ joins President Trump and an administration who are stopping at nothing to strengthen institutional discrimination and walk back the hard-fought progress made by the LGBTQ community . ”
Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin felt similarly , calling the decision an “ appalling assault ” in a series of tweets Thursday .
Appalling assault on Title VII protections for trans workers . Trump admin will stop at nothing to drag us backwards . https : //t.co/xf2QQpRcDr — Chad Griffin ( @ ChadHGriffin ) October 5 , 2017
Dangerous : Trump & Sessions blatantly ignoring their responsibility to protect the civil rights of all Americans . https : //t.co/hCBTYdOyIm — Chad Griffin ( @ ChadHGriffin ) October 5 , 2017
In a Thursday statement , the American Civil Liberties Union 's ( ACLU ) LGBT & HIV Project Director James Esseks called the news “ another low point for a Department of Justice . ”
“ This Department of Justice under Jeff Sessions has time and time again made it clear that its explicit agenda is to attack and undermine the civil rights of our most vulnerable communities , ” they wrote , “ rather than standing up for them as they should be doing . ”
Still , Esseks remained “ confident that the courts will continue to agree and will reject the politically driven decision by Attorney General Sessions . ”
Preparatory work has begun on the construction of resettlement areas for the Xiongan New Area , a new economic zone southwest of Beijing , said a senior official with the Xiongan New Area management committee .
The management committee will help residents who are to be relocated move to new modern , green and comfortable homes , said the official .
The committee will inform residents several months in advance .
China announced plans in April to establish the Xiongan New Area , which covers Hebei 's Xiongxian , Rongcheng and Anxin counties . It will facilitate the coordinated development of Beijing and the surrounding region .

If the NFL was hoping that Colin Kaepernick 's absence from a team roster would allow them to move on from player protests during the national anthem , they 've been proven very wrong during the first week of preseason games . Raiders star running back Marshawn Lynch was the first to sit through the anthem on Saturday , which they insisted is something he 's been doing for years .
On Sunday , Lynch 's former teammate and Seahawks ' star defensive end Michael Bennett joined them as stars to sit through the anthem in protest . Bennett is known as one of the league 's most vocal players when it comes to social and political issues , so it should n't come as a significant surprise that they would be among those to take a stand in response to the tragic events in Charlottesville , Virginia over the weekend .

Fed leaves key rate unchanged at Yellen 's final meeting
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Federal Reserve has left its benchmark interest rate unchanged but signaled that it expects to resume raising rates gradually to reflect a healthy job market and economy . At Janet Yellen 's final meeting as chair Wednesday , the Fed kept its key short-term rate in a still-low range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent . It said in a statement that it expects inflation to finally pick up this year and to stabilize around the Fed 's target level of 2 percent . In its previous statement , the Fed had predicted that inflation would remain below its target rate .

Health cares just the latest industry Amazon seeks to upend
NEW YORK ( AP ) — When Amazon sets its sights on a new industry , Corporate America shudders . The latest example came Tuesday , when the online retailing giant said it was working with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to create a health care company to offer an `` affordable '' option to their employees . Stocks of health insurers tumbled , erasing billions of dollars in shareholder value . One expert says Amazon is feared because it grows businesses quickly and takes market share fast .

Judging by algorithm : Using risk factors to score defendants
CLEVELAND ( AP ) — Instead of holding criminal defendants on cash bail , courts around the United States are increasingly using algorithmic risk-assessment tools to help judges decide if a defendant should be jailed or go free while awaiting trial . A model now used by New Jersey and other state and regional courts is the Public Safety Assessment , developed by the Houston-based Laura and John Arnold Foundation . It uses nine risk factors to evaluate a defendant , including age and past criminal convictions .

No penalty : Small businesses let sports fans enjoy big games
NEW YORK ( AP ) — Many business owners are cutting staffers a little slack as fans find it hard to resist chatting about the Super Bowl . The Olympics , the NCAA basketball tournament and other events that are coming up as well .

Court rejects lawsuit against Twitter over IS attack
SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) — A federal appeals court has rejected a lawsuit that sought to hold Twitter liable for the deaths of two U.S. contractors in Jordan in an attack for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility . The 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals said Wednesday the suit failed to establish that Twitter accounts used by IS directly caused the men 's deaths . Lloyd Fields and James Creach were shot and killed in Jordan in 2015 by a Jordanian police captain while training law enforcement officers .

Apple to respond to US probes into slowdown of old iPhones
SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) — Apple is cooperating with U.S. government inquiries into its secret slowdown of older iPhones , further complicating its efforts to move past an issue that irked many customers whose devices bogged down .

Apple has already apologized to customers .

US appeals court gives victory to consumer finance agency
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — A federal appeals court has handed a victory to the government 's beleaguered consumer finance watchdog agency , ruling that its director 's power is n't excessive and the president should n't have freer rein to fire that person . The decision came Wednesday in the politically charged case involving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a keen target of conservative Republicans . The nine-member panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals , with three judges dissenting , overturned a 2016 ruling by a smaller panel that would have made it easier for President Donald Trump to fire then-CFPB director Richard Cordray , an Obama appointee .

NEW YORK ( AP ) — U.S. stocks overcame a brief stumble to close slightly higher Wednesday , snapping a two-day losing streak .

The Fed , as expected , held off on raising interest rates . Stocks bounced back in the last hour of trading , with gains by technology companies outweighing losses in health care and other sectors .

Protesters in Durham , North Carolina toppled a Confederate statue outside the courthouse on Monday evening.The monument of a Confederate soldier holding a rifle was erected in 1924 . The statue 's inscription read : `` In memory of the boys who wore the gray . `` The crowd was small in numbers , but steadily grew to more than 100.As the crowd became more animated , several protesters approached the monument and threw some sort of nylon rope around it , eventually pulling the statue of the soldier to the ground.After the statue fell , many of the protesters kicked and stomped it.Protesters then moved and blocked an intersection.The protesters later marched to the site of the new Durham Police headquarters , which is under construction.Durham Police remained close by , but kept their distance from the protesters .
A rally to save the Confederate monument in Travis Park was met by counterprotesters in support of removing the memorial last Saturday .
The mostly peaceful events in San Antonio coincided with violent demonstrations the same day in Charlottesville , Virginia stemming from a similar debate about the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee .
Part of downtown 's Travis Park since its dedication in 1899 , the 40-foot-tall memorial to Confederate soldiers withstood resistance during initial construction as well as calls for removal in 2015 .
The recent rally and local interest is spurred by the submission of a council consideration request by District 1 representative Roberto Treviño and District 2 representative William `` Cruz '' Shaw to relocate the monument .
`` Going forward , community involvement will be critical to developing a thoughtful and appropriate relocation plan , '' Treviño said in a statement . `` Please continue to bring forth your opinions and ideas . We are listening . ”
What is the history behind Confederate monuments in San Antonio ? Can a compromise be found for the statue in Travis Park ?
How do disputes over similar issues nationwide affect the future of identity in the United States ?

ZUG , Switzerland & RESTON , Va. -- ( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Apr 23 , 2018 -- Luxoft Holding Inc. ( NYSE : LXFT ) , a global IT service provider , today announces it has built a blockchain adapter for Appian 's ( NASDAQ : APPN ) rapid application development platform . It is now available exclusively to businesses using Appian 's Business Process Management ( BPM ) tool and will allow its users to integrate a blockchain network into their day-to-day business processes creating a secure , digital environment that facilitates data sharing .
This press release features multimedia . View the full release here : https : //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180423005657/en/
“ The launch of this adapter is about helping businesses realise the huge potential of blockchain by making it easier to use , ” “ Problems integrating blockchain into existing in-house systems are often the biggest obstacles to its adoption . Now , by integrating blockchain into a BPM , a business can leverage the benefits of a decentralised model whilst retaining its existing IT architecture . This means business do n't have to rip out their old IT systems to use blockchain . ”
Luxoft will demonstrate how the adapter can be used to benefit the healthcare sector for the first time at Appian World in Miami , FL , US at the Luxoft booth ( # 16 ) . In particular , Luxoft will show how the blockchain adapter can reduce claims processing errors and inaccurate medical bills . The blockchain creates a secure , reliable and auditable way for medical and pharmacy systems to share and update real-time accumulators , meaning medical insurers , healthcare providers and pharmacies using the Appian Platform instantly have access to the same claim data .
“ The disparate systems used by pharmacies , healthcare providers and insurers to manage medical information are extremely complex . They are not designed for the smooth exchange of data , ” . “ The Appian blockchain adapter will be a step towards seamless integration across the healthcare ecosystem enabling payers , providers and patients to exchange and verify data in a safe and compliant way . ”
“ At Appian we value our partner ecosystem and are committed to supporting them as we grow in the key Healthcare market , ” said Marc Wilson , SVP Global Partnerships & Industries at Appian . “ Blockchain impacts organizations across all industries , but it is an especially difficult challenge within the Healthcare industry given the complexities they face . Through our partnership with Luxoft , our customers now have a solution specifically designed to address these needs within the Appian platform . ”
Luxoft built the Adapter on Appian 's Platform , as it 's used extensively across a variety of industries , from financial services to healthcare , in areas such as provider data management , medical management and clinical trials . The move is part of a push to commercialise Distributed Ledger Technologies and accelerate its deployment in established business processes .

Sunderland Harriers stage their 28th Penshaw Hill Race tonight with both Scott Ellis and Alice Smith defending their titles .
The popular North East Vending sponsored race sees North Shields athlete Ellis and Sunderland Harrier Smith heading the entries .
Ellis will be going for their third win having also won in 2014 , while Smith is looking for their second title .
Both athletes also made it a winning double as they took the prime award as the first athletes to reach the famous monument on the opening lap .
Ellis said after winning last year : “ I was surprised I was on my own so soon into the race . I love this event and it 's great to come here again and win . ”
Sunderland Harriers have dominated the race over the years , having lost the title only six times .
Brian Rushworth , now forced into retirement through a knee injury , is the undisputed King of Penshaw Hill , having won the race 18 times with their last win coming in 2012 .
And during that time they only suffered two defeats . In 2011 they lost to Liam Taylor and in 2013 it was their clubmate Nathan Reed who headed him . Their record of 15.04 was set in 1996 .
Taylor could be on the start line tonight as a late entry and , if so , could challenge for the title .
Reed will be absent as they are still on the road to recovery following an Achilles ' tendon injury .
Over-40 veteran Ian Dixon ( Sunderland Harriers ) looks likely to be the club 's leading challenger and should be thereabouts at the finish at the top of the gruelling hill .
They have only competed once previously when they finished fifth in 2013 .
Houghton Harrier Lee Dover , who finished third in the Temple Park 5k on Friday , will be gunning for top spot . They make their debut .
Washington 's Running Club 's Tim Jones , with a number of wins in the Trail Outlaws events , is in good form and will also be chasing a place in the frame .
Of the entries on paper so far in the women 's race , Smith appears to have a clear run after their victory last year in 18.58 . The course record stands to Karen Hind ( Gateshead ) with 18.20 from 1999 .
Other athletes in contention should be 17-year-old Sarah Knight and Over-35 Vikki Cotton of the host club plus Kim Simpson ( Durham City Harriers ) .
Houghton Harrier Sheila Allen , now retired , holds the record for the number of wins ( six ) ranging from 1993 to 2003 .
The race , over approximately three miles and over two laps , starts at 7.15pm . The prize presentation will be in the Monument pub in Penshaw Village at approximately 8.30pm . Late entries are available .
The Harriers ' cross-country grand prix , held over the winter months , will also have their presentation . There was a close contest with Vikki Cotton wining on count back from Paul Redman .
The winners were Vikki Cotton with 48pts , Paul Redman was second also on 48pts , Allan McManus was third 44pts , Alice Smith fourth 32pts and Paul Merrison fifth 32pts .
Sunderland Stroller Lynne Valentine won the Over-60 section of the Edinburgh Half Marathon after clocking 1.41.30 . Clubmate Chris Parker recorded 1.28.44 .
In the marathon , Sunderland Harrier Richard Borrowdale recorded 2.57.26 , Sunderland Strollers had Michael Dixon on 3.15.32 and Andrew Dobinson with 3.48.07 . Houghton Harriers saw Katherine James run 3.40.53 , Marguerite Harvey 3.44.8 and Carla King claimed 4.01 min exactly .
Sunderland Harrier Mark Smith clocked a personal best for 800m ( 1.54.91 ) at the Loughborough International . Their performance moves them to number 10 on the Harriers ' all-time list , knocking Stephen Bird ( 1.55.1 ) 1982 from the top 10 .
The country 's top officials continue to enjoy the approval and trust of the majority of Filipinos in March , the latest Pulse Asia survey showed .
Out of 1,200 respondents nationwide , 78 percent approved of President Duterte 's performance , 5 points down from 83 percent in December , while 76 percent trusted Mr. Duterte , down by 7 points to 76 percent from 83 percent .
Approval of Vice President Leni Robredo declined by 4 points to 58 percent from 62 percent , while their trust scores slid by 2 points to 56 percent from 58 percent . —Inquirer Research

Ex-Baseco exec charged over anomalous rental deal
Former Bataan Shipyard and Engineering Co. Inc. ( Baseco ) president Proceso Maligalig has been charged at the Sandiganbayan for allegedly settling for a portion of a lessee 's unpaid rent without the approval of Baseco 's board .
Maligalig , former spokesperson of Reform the Armed Forces Movement , faces one count each of malversation through falsification and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act .
They were accused of causing undue injury to the government by receiving P3.55 million from Northstar Transport Facilities Inc. as “ full settlement , ” even as its lease arrears for May 2009 to February 2010 totaled P4.82 million . —Vince F. Nonato
Bureau of Customs seizes plane for unpaid taxes
The Bureau of Customs ( BOC ) has taken into custody a plane used to bring local tourists and for chartered flights after its owners failed to present a certificate of payment of duties and taxes from the bureau .
James Layug , head of the BOC 's Special Studies and Project Development Committee ( SSPDC ) , said the aircraft belonged to Skyjet Airlines .
BOC said Magnum Air Inc. , the owner and operator of Skyjet , had already been delisted from the Subic Bay Freeport List of Locators and had ceased operations since 2014 .

During an inspection of its hangar , the airline 's property custodian failed to show proof of payment of duties and taxes and other documents on the acquisition of the aircraft and its operations . Magnum Air was given 15 days to present the required documents . —Tina G. Santos
Troops told to find body of beheaded hostage
Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief Gen. Eduardo Año on Monday ordered the Joint Task Force Sulu ( JTFS ) in Western Mindanao to locate the remains of Filipino hostage Noel Besconde who was beheaded by the Abu Sayyaf Group ( ASG ) led by sub-leader Sadjawaan on April 13 in Barangay Tugas in Patikul town , Sulu province .
Año ordered Brig . Gen. Cirilito Sobejana , JTFS commander , to bring Besconde 's remains to the family of the slain victim so they could be given a decent burial .
Besconde was one of four crew members of FB Ramona abducted in the Celebes Sea in December last year .
Sobejana said they believed Besconde was killed because they were ill and their condition would impede the movement of the ASG bandits who were being pursued by troops . —Cynthia D. Balana
Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered a 4,400-year-old tomb near the country 's famed pyramids at the Giza plateau just outside Cairo , the Antiquities Ministry said Saturday , the latest discovery that authorities hope will help revive the country 's staggering tourism sector .
The tomb was found in a wider area of Giza 's western necropolis , which is known to be home to tombs from the Old Kingdom .
It likely belonged to a woman known as Hetpet , who archaeologists believe was close to ancient Egyptian royals of the 5th Dynasty .
The tomb , unveiled to the media on Saturday , is made of mud brick and includes wall paintings in good condition depicting Hetpet observing different hunting and fishing scenes .
Other scenes also depict a monkey — in pharaonic times , monkeys were commonly kept as domestic animals — picking fruit . Similar scenes have been found in other tombs belonging to the later 12th dynasty , according to the ministry 's statement . Another scene shows a monkey dancing before an orchestra .
According to the ministry , the archaeological mission behind the discovery started excavation work last October . Archaeologists have been making discoveries near the site since the 19th century , and Mostafa al-Waziri , who led the mission , believes there is still more to be found .
`` This is a very promising area . We expect to find more , '' Al-Waziri told reporters at the site . `` We have removed between 250-300 cubic meters of layers of earth to find the tomb . ''
`` What we see above the earth 's surface in Egypt does n't exceed 40 percent of what the core holds , '' they added .
Al-Waziri believes Hetpet had another tomb in Giza 's western necropolis and said that excavation work is underway to find that one too .
Hetpet is a previously known figure in Egyptian antiquity though their mummy has not been discovered yet . Fragments of artefacts belonging to Hetpet were found in the same area back in 1909 , and were moved to a museum in Berlin at the time , Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani said Saturday , speaking at the site to reporters and Western diplomats .
Despite all the discoveries already made about ancient Egypt , experts say they hope to find much more — in part thanks to modern technology — treasures still buried under the vast desert .
The area of the latest discovery is close to a new museum under construction that will house some of Egypt 's most unique and precious artifacts , including many belonging to the famed boy King Tutankhamun .
The first phase of Grand Egyptian museum is expected to be opened later this year while the grand opening is planned for 2022 .
In January , Egypt placed the ancient statue of one of its most famous pharaohs , Ramses II at the museum 's atrium , which will include 43 massive statues .
Throughout 2017 , the Antiquities Ministry made a string of discoveries across Egypt — including some in the southern city Luxor known for its spectacular temples and tombs spanning different dynasties of ancient Egyptian history .
Egypt hopes the inauguration of the new museum , along with the recent discoveries , will draw back visitors to the country where tourism has been hit hard by extremist attacks and political turmoil following the 2011 popular uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak and the authorities ' struggles to rein in an insurgency by Islamic militants .
The government has tightened security around archaeological and touristic sites and spent millions of dollars to upgrade airport security especially following the 2015 downing of a Russian airliner over the restive Sinai Peninsula by the Islamic State group , killing 224 people on board .
The bombing dealt Egypt 's vital tourism sector a hard blow after Russia suspended flights to and from Egypt .
In December , Cairo and Moscow signed a security protocol and announced plans to resume Russian flights to the Egyptian capital , due to start this month .
FILE - In this Nov. 9 , 2016 , file photo , Conor McGregor gestures toward fans while working out at Madison Square Garden in New York . Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. said Wednesday , June 14 , 2017 , they will come out of retirement to face UFC star Conor McGregor in a boxing match on Aug. 26 . Mayweather , who retired in September 2015 after winning all 49 of their pro fights , will face a mixed martial arts fighter who has never been in a scheduled 12-round fight at the MGM Grand arena . The fight will take place in a boxing ring and be governed by boxing rules . ( AP Photo/Julio Cortez , File )
LAS VEGAS ( AP ) -- The real fun will come before the fight , and what a spectacle it should be . Put Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor on a stage together to promote their fight and anything can happen .
Put them together in a ring , though , and it 's an absolute mismatch .
That 's the first thing to consider when all the talk begins about what a devastating puncher McGregor is . The first thing to think about when it 's suggested that Mayweather may have lost some of their skills after two years of traveling the world in their private jet .
If you thought you were snookered out of $ 100 when Mayweather fought a snoozer against Manny Pacquiao , you might keep a firm hand on your wallet . The greatest defensive fighter of their time against a guy who has never thrown a punch in a pro boxing match ?
Let the yawning begin .
This could be 12 rounds of tedium on Aug. 26 in Las Vegas that makes Mayweather-Pacquiao look like Hagler-Hearns in comparison . It might be some kind of bizarre disqualification when McGregor finds out Mayweather does n't stick their chin out to be hit the way some UFC fighters do or really does try to kick Mayweather when he 's down .
What it wo n't be is any kind of legitimate fight , no matter how much rabid UFC fans want desperately to believe it will be .
That 's no knock on McGregor , who is a ferocious puncher in the octagon with a personality to match their power . Indeed , they would likely be heavily favored over Mayweather had the two decided to do the fight under UFC rules .
One of the great trash talkers , too , who was just warming up on Wednesday when they told UFC chief Dana White what their intentions are .
'' Conor told me this morning the McGregor clan has been taking over villages for 300 years , '' White said , `` and that Floyd 's village is next . ''
Good stuff , and there 's lots more to come . McGregor can turn a phrase as well as they can throw a punch or a water bottle at an opponent .
If this was a reality show it would be a hit in the ratings . Just imagine the scene when McGregor rolls into Mayweather 's new strip club in Las Vegas and mimics their propensity for throwing cash around .
But this is a boxing match , and Mayweather is a masterful boxer . They were throwing punches before they could walk , and if they had elected to stay in retirement he 'd still be considered one of the top 10 fighters ever .
Two years out of the ring wo n't change that . Age wo n't be a factor , either , and Mayweather has never let themselves get out of shape .
Oddsmakers in this gambling city understand that , setting the initial line at a whopping 11-1 in Mayweather 's favor . It would be even higher than that , but UFC fans will be lining up with $ 20 bills in hand to bet their man as an underdog .
'' Realistically if we were just putting up a number and did n't have to take bets on it , Floyd would be 100-1 , '' said Nick Bogdanovich , oddsmaker for the William Hill chain .
Mayweather was out on a run in Los Angeles when the fight was announced , training intensely already like they always do . Someone else will have to watch over the strip club for a few months while they focus on the task at hand .
There 's huge money at stake , even for a fighter who made more than $ 200 million for beating Pacquiao . No one is making predictions , but it 's likely the hybrid fight will at least end up in second place in pay-per-view sales behind the $ 400 million or so brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight .
Balance that against the chance McGregor may ruin their brand - and that of the UFC - by being embarrassed by Mayweather in the ring , and the money wins out .
Even White , who was initially skeptical about putting their star in a boxing match , seems ready now to push the idea that they could actually win .
'' I 've stopped doubting this kid a long time ago , '' White said . '' The reason he 's such a superstar is this guy will fight anyone , anywhere , at any time . ''
Give McGregor credit for doing that , but give them even more credit for what turned out to be a masterful plan to make the fight happen . It was two years ago that they first suggested they could beat Mayweather in a boxing ring , and he 's trolled Mayweather ever since , jabbing at every opening until they finally got them to sign on the dotted line .
Sure , it 's a freak show of sorts , bordering on something you see in WWE . But both fighters know their roles , and they will play them well .
So enjoy the ride , because it should be a wild one .
Just understand that the fun almost surely ends when the opening bell rings .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The United States is encouraging other U.N. Security Council countries to set aside the nuclear deal loathed by President Donald Trump and focus on cracking down on Iran 's missile and other non-nuclear transgressions , U.N . Ambassador Nikki Haley said Monday .
Haley , who brought fellow Security Council ambassadors on a field trip to Washington , suggested that a concerted global effort to punish Iran for violating Security Council resolutions on ballistic missiles could persuade Trump it was worthwhile to remain in the nuclear deal . They noted that France , a key member of the group that negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal , had recently `` started hitting '' Iran rhetorically for violating ballistic missile resolutions .
`` It 's working , '' Haley said after meeting with Trump and the other ambassadors . `` They 're starting to realize , 'If we do n't start talking about the violations , if we do n't call them out , then the U.S. is going to say this whole thing is a sham . ' ''
An outspoken critic of Iran , Haley brought the other Security Council envoys to a U.S. military base in Washington to view missile parts that the U.S. calls evidence of Iran 's illicit transfer of prohibited missiles to Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen . The Trump administration maintains that fragments from those missiles , recovered in Saudi Arabia after being launched from Yemen by the Houthis , contain markings proving they were Iranian-made , though some security experts have questioned whether the evidence is foolproof .
Haley 's bid to persuade key nations about Iranian misbehavior comes as world leaders fret about the future of the Iran deal , which Trump has threatened to scuttle unless it can be improved to their liking . With dim prospects for re-opening the deal , Trump 's administration has instead been looking to add requirements to the U.S. law governing implementation of the deal so that sanctions , waived as part of the deal , could be put back in place if Iran continues with non-nuclear activity that the U.S. deems unacceptable .
The Trump administration has also been trying to persuade the European nations that negotiated the deal with the Obama administration to accept side deals under which they would join the U.S. in re-imposing sanctions if Iran continues ballistic missile testing or refuses U.N. inspections of sensitive sites . Trump 's threats to rip up the painstakingly negotiated deal have become a key point of tension between the U.S. and European nations .
China and Russia , two Security Council nations that are part of the nuclear deal , have been particularly reluctant to impose additional conditions on Iran , and have cast doubt on U.S. allegations that Tehran is funneling weapons to the Houthis to be used against U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia . Haley said that skepticism came across as their ambassadors viewed the missile parts on display in Washington .
`` The Chinese just took notes , '' Haley said . `` The Russians questioned the missiles , how they got to Yemen . ''
Haley 's message to the Russians : `` How do you dispute this ? It 's got 'Made in Iran ' welded on it , '' they said , referring figuratively to markings on the missiles that U.S. defense officials say suggest Iranian origin .
During the daylong visit , Haley took ambassadors to the U.S . Holocaust Memorial Museum with national security adviser H.R . McMaster and to lunch at the White House with Trump , where discussions focused on international hotspots such as Syria , North Korea and terrorism .
Each ambassador had the chance to take a photo with the president — including Russia 's envoy to the U.N. , who took the president up on the opportunity , Haley said .
They said several ambassadors later conveyed to them a similar impression of the president : `` He was n't anything like what we see on TV . ''

Tuesday - Thundery showers mainly over northern and eastern Singapore in the afternoon .
Wednesday - Late morning and early afternoon thundery showers .
Them story is told with the honesty of photographs .
“ This is me as a child , ” begins Jodi Krah , 54 . They hold a black-and-white photograph of a girl , themselves at age 8 , balancing in a T-position on white figure skates . They wear a long-sleeved bodysuit and mini-skirt , gloves and a hat trimmed with fur that frames a circle around them face .
“ I was always a chubby kid , ” they say .
Jodi grew up on a farm in Fonthill . The outdoors was their playground . They were always running around with friends , playing tag or hide and seek .
“ We were n't allowed to be in the house , ” they say . “ We played outside . ”
There were chores to do , and animals to feed . In the summer , they played baseball , and in the winter , skated .
“ I was very active , ” they say . “ And I just happened to be a bigger kid . ”
At school , kids teased them Called their names . Once , a boy thought it would be funny to hand them a dog biscuit . At 10 years old , they went on their first diet . Them mother was concerned about their weight , and the grief it was causing them at school .
“ I felt different , because I looked different , ” says Jodi .
The next image they show is a pencil sketch they created in high school . A self portrait . They are sitting behind a table , their eyes cast downwards . Them mother found it on their bedroom dresser . “ It startled her , ” says Jodi .
They tried diet programs , read books and even experimented with hypnosis . They lost weight , but always gained it back .
“ You feel like it 's you , ” they say . “ You did n't try hard enough . You do n't have enough willpower . If you only exercised more , ate less and tried harder … ”
It was a sentiment reinforced by their family doctor .
“ I felt defeated , ” they say .
When they enrolled at Brock University in fine arts , they painted a portrait of themselves naked , sad and big . Classmates knew them as an outgoing , gregarious personality , not as the person they were on the inside . Sad . Unaccepted . And vulnerable .
When they finally presented their artwork to the class , it silenced the room .
“ Why is everyone looking shocked ? ” they asked .
No one replied . Eventually , their teacher spoke : “ It 's the overwhelming sadness . They do n't know what to say . ”
They offer a final photo . “ This is what I looked like , nine years ago , ” they say . Jodi is at their heaviest , a Size 24 . They are holding a birthday cake , a white apron is wrapped around their midsection .
They are about 100 pounds heavier than they are now .
In their lifetime , they have gained and lost hundreds of pounds and spent thousands of dollars on weight-loss strategies .
But what they most wants people to understand , is not how they eventually lost the pounds but the damage that can be caused from living under the weight of fat-shaming .
They participate on the science committee of the Canadian Obesity Network and is part of its public engagement initiative . They also offer their voice as a public speaker .
It 's a passion shared by Dr. Arya Sharma , scientific director of the Canadian Obesity Network .
They do n't mince words . “ Obesity stigma is based on this notion that fat people are lazy , ” they say . “ They 're not motivated . They 're not trying to lose weight .
“ And so it 's their problem . They 're doing it to themselves . Obesity is self-inflicted . It 's your fault . It 's something to be ashamed of . And when you get it , you 've got no one to blame but yourself . ”
Shame and blame can be debilitating .
It causes anxiety and stress . Destroys resilience . And it drains motivation to go out into the world and enjoy life . People live in fear of judgment , they say .
And it does n't work . It changes nothing .
“ If feeling bad about yourself was a good motivator to change , then we would n't have obesity , ” they say .
“ It 's not possible to make them feel worse .
“ They 're already feeling bad . They 're already depressed . They 're already angry at themselves . They already feel like failures . They already feel that they 've done this to themselves . ”
What 's needed is education , they say .
Obesity is not a number on the scale . It 's not a percentage calculation of body fat . It is simply this : an excess of body fat that affects a person 's health , says Sharma , who is also a professor of medicine and chair in obesity research and management at University of Alberta .
In Canada , one in four adults and one in 10 children live with obesity . That 's about six million Canadians , according to the obesity network .
Exactly why a person has excessive body fat is complicated . “ There 's an endless list of factors , ” they say . To peg it solely on how much a person eats and exercises , is to over simplify and play into an uninformed stereotype , they say .
Genetics is a big influence . “ The genetics that determines our body weight is as strong as the genetics that determines our height , ” they say .
Genetics can make people more or less susceptible to weight gain , they say . That 's why a group of people could consume exactly the same number of calories , exactly the same diet , and some will gain weight and some will lose weight .
In fact , it can take surprisingly few extra calories — say 30 calories a day of a recommended 2,000 — to gain a pound or two a year , they say .
Add stress , sleep problems , a genetic predisposition to weight gain , insulin resistance , previous attempts at weight loss , and the complexities of obesity become more clear , they say .
In simple terms , they remind people this : “ The human body is physiology . ”
It can learn to run on less fuel . If given fewer calories , the human body will quickly adapt and run more efficiently , not shed pounds .
“ Your physiology is designed to defend your body fat , ” they say . “ Your body does n't really care how you got to 200 pounds . Once you 're 200 pounds , 200 pounds is the weight that your body defends .
“ It does n't matter what exercises you do . It does n't matter what diet you go on . Any time your body weight falls below 200 , your body is working very hard to get it back to 200 .
“ Which is why every diet ultimately fails . ”
There are many benefits to exercise and physical activity . Just do n't confuse physical fitness , with weight loss . It 's possible to be both fat and fit .
“ There 's no question that physical activity and exercise will improve physical fitness . It 's important for good health , ” they say . “ The problem is , it does very little for body weight regulation . ”
Along with greater education , fat-shaming needs to end , they say .
Earlier this year , the Canadian Obesity Network embarked on a campaign that drew attention to the abundance of unflattering media images used to portray people who live with obesity .
“ You 're not going to see the person who is wearing an Armani suit , ” says Sharma . “ What you 're going to see is the overweight person in the ill-fitting sweatpants and the T-shirt that 's too short , but you just see the mid-line poking out , ” they say .
The fat person usually has a pop can in one hand , a hamburger in the other , often with their head cut out of the photo , to accentuate the belly , they say .
Implicit in the images is moral judgment and blame .
“ We 've got this level of discrimination that goes through the whole system , ” they say . “ And it 's all based on a misunderstanding of obesity . ”

Ah the ubiquitous web browser . What would we do without one ? Not much , that 's for sure . No matter if you 're seated at your desk or roaming about with mobile in hand , you depend upon a web browser . But which browser ? That 's the key . There are browsers for every type of user , especially in the mobile landscape . Most users , however , simply live with the default . On Android , that 's Chrome . What would you say if I told you there were better options ?
There 's Firefox , Opera , Puffin , Dolphin , Naked Browser , Orfox , Ghostery , and so many more . But one particular mobile browser tends to fall through the cracks . That browser is Via Browser , and it is certainly worth your time . Via Browser is a lightweight , fast , customizable , mini browser that does n't feel like a `` mini '' browser at all . In fact , outside of the fast speeds , Via contains enough features to make it feel like its full-blown brothers and sisters . Via is also really stable , with a developer that actively works to fix bugs and add new features .
Let 's install Via Browser on Android and see if it might make you want to switch from your default .
Installation
The installation of Via Browser is quite simple . Here are the necessary steps :
Open the Google Play Store on your Android device Search for Via Browser Locate and tap the entry by Lakor Tap Install Allow the installation to complete
That 's all there is to the installation . At this point , you should see an icon for Via on the home screen or the App Drawer ( or both ) . Tap to launch the browser .
Permissions
Out of the gate , you 'll be warned about the necessary permissions . The developer has done a great job of explaining these permissions ( so users wo n't grow paranoid that the browser is spying on them in any way - Figure A ) .
Figure A
Dismiss this warning and then okay the necessary permissions ( Storage and Location ) .
Usage
Using Via Browser is incredibly intuitive . From the homepage ( Figure B ) tap the search bar and either type a search string or a URL . If you type a search string , the results will appear in a Google search . If you type a URL , guess what ? The site in question will appear . Simple .
Figure B
If you do n't want Google as your search provider , you can tap the Menu button ( three horizontal bar icons in the bottom right of the Via homepage ) and tap Settings . Tap General and scroll down until you see Search Engine . Tap Search Engine and select from the available options ( Figure C ) .
Figure C
One option I like with the default Chrome browser is the pull down to refresh gesture . Fortunately , Via includes this—only it 's not enabled by default . To enable this option , go to Settings | General | Operation . In this screen ( Figure D ) , tap to enable the Pull to Refresh Gesture .
Figure D
Privacy
Out of the box , Via Browser has Done Not Track and Block Ads enabled and Location Access disabled . There is also an included Incognito Mode , for use when you want to leave nothing to chance . To get to the Incognito Mode , tap the Menu button and then tap Incognito Mode ( Figure E ) .
Figure E
Tabs
I have to admit , I really like how the Via Browser handles tabs . At the bottom of the window , you 'll see a small square with a number . That number is now many tabs you have open . Tap that square to reveal a popup that allows you to quickly access any of those open tabs ( Figure F ) .
Figure F
Closing an open tab is just a matter of tapping its associated X .
Why I use Via Browser
Of all the mobile web browsers I 've used , Via offers the best ratio of speed , options , and simplicity . Are there better browsers ? Sure . On the desktop , Firefox is my go-to , but not so much on my mobile devices . When I 'm on the go , I need fast , simple , and lightweight . That 's Via Browser to a tee . If you 've yet to find that perfect mobile browser , I highly suggest you give Via a try and see if it does n't wind up your default .

Dozens of vigils and demonstrations were held across the country Sunday a day after a woman was killed at an anti-fascist rally in Charlottesville , Virginia .
The vigils honored the life of Heather Heyer , who died when a man drove their car into a group of counterprotesters on Saturday afternoon , with some calling for action against hate groups .
`` Really devastated , really disappointed that terrorists came and took over , '' Leah Larsen , a Charlottesville resident told ABC affiliate WRIC on Saunday . `` Everyone 's hearts are aching , just really upset that this is still going on even after we fought wars over this . ''
Heyer was part of the group that assembled to denounce the `` Unite the Right '' rally held by far-right groups on Saturday . A melee broke out between the two sides followed by the car-ramming that killed Heyer and injured 19 others .
Police arrested James Alex Fields , 20 , and charged them with second-degree murder in the incident .
A vigil was also held in Charlottesville at the location where Heyer was killed , and in a number of other U.S. cities .
Most of the rallies were peaceful , though in Seattle protesters clashed with a previously planned pro-Donald Trump rally . Police dispersed the rally with pepper spray and blast balls after fireworks were thrown at officers , according to the Associated Press . ABC affiliate KOMO in Seattle reported three protesters were arrested .
Here 's a look at a few of of Sunday 's gatherings :

`` Coach K got their 1,000th win there . It 's obviously a very special place . Cameron Indoor ( Stadium ) is probably the most special place for Duke basketball , but there have been a lot of great plays for Duke in Madison Square Garden . We just have to continue that culture . ''
A victory gives Duke its 22nd straight 20-win season and the program 's 53rd in history .

TEL AVIV , Israel ( AP ) — Israel 's defense minister says that should war erupt again with Lebanon that country will `` pay the full price '' for Iran 's entrenchment .
Avidgor Lieberman says Wednesday that Hezbollah guerrillas have sacrificed Lebanon 's national interests by subjugating fully to Iran . They say , as a result , all of Lebanon will be fair game in a future war .
Speaking to the Institute for National Security Studies ' annual conference , Lieberman says the Lebanese army will be targeted and `` if citizen of Tel Aviv are forced to sit in shelters , all of Beirut will too . ''
Israel and Hezbollah fought a fierce , monthlong war in 2006 .
Israel has recently been warning of Iran 's increasing efforts to turn Lebanon into `` one giant missile site . '' Israel 's chief military spokesperson this week said it was `` prepared for all the scenarios . ''

A Kitchener woman who admitted to taking part in the sexual assault of a seven-year-old Hamilton girl has had their sentencing delayed .
Sonya Lucas , who was already a registered sex offender at the time of their arrest last year , spoke to a Hamilton courtroom for the final time before she 'll learn how many years she 'll spend behind bars . As they spoke to the judge , Lucas says she 'd “ give anything to go back in time and change what she 's done . ”
The 49-year-old was arrested in 2016 during an investigation of a seven-year-old Hamilton girl who was being advertised online for sexual services . Rui Dasilva of Waterloo , hired Lucas an escort to accompany them to Hamilton . Lucas claims they did n't know a young girl was going to be involved , but admitted they did record and take part in the assault . They also accepted $ 100 in payment from Dasilva .
Lucas pled guilty in June to sexual interference and making and possessing child pornography . The crown attorney is calling for 10 years behind bars . Lucas ' lawyer , Hal Mattson , alleges Lucas was sexually assaulted by a number of men in their life as a child , including their uncle and a foster father . However , charges were withdrawn against the uncle and the foster father was acquitted . Mattson is calling for a 5 to 6 years sentence . Dasilva has already been sentenced to 8 years in prison for their role in the abuse .
Judge Tony Leitch says they need more time to review the final submissions but says they will hand down a sentence on December 21st .
UCLA men 's basketball head coach Steve Alford has reclaimed the contract extension they returned two seasons ago as the school announced Friday a one-year extension for them through the 2020-21 season .
In an open letter released after the team 's disappointing 15-17 season in 2015-16 , Alford explained that they requested to nullify the one-year extension they signed in 2014 . It did n't take them long to earn it back , as UCLA , with three eventual NBA draft picks , advanced to the Sweet 16 for the third time in Alford 's four years .
The Bruins went 31-6 last season before falling to Kentucky in the Sweet 16 . Freshman Lonzo Ball led an offense that finished second in the nation in points per game ( 89.8 ) and led the country in assists per game ( 21.4 ) , field goal percentage ( 52.2 percent ) and assist-turnover ratio ( 1.91 ) .
“ Steve did an outstanding job , helping to produce one of the nation 's most exciting offensive teams in recent memory , ” athletic director Dan Guerrero said in a statement Friday . “ There was a significant buzz about UCLA basketball around town and among the sellout crowds in Pauley Pavilion . As such , they certainly earned back the one-year extension that they had voluntarily returned prior to the season . ”
Entering their fifth year with the Bruins , Alford has a 96-45 overall record , three Sweet 16 appearances ( 2014 , '15 and '17 ) and back-to-back top-five recruiting classes . After the 2016 class of Ball , TJ Leaf and Ike Anigbogu ranked fifth in the country , according to ESPN , the Bruins have ESPN 's No . 5 class again in 2017 .
Five-star prospects Kris Wilkes and Jaylen Hands lead the six-man group that also includes LiAngelo Ball , of Chino Hills , Sierra Canyon 's Cody Riley and Corona Centennial 's Jalen Hall . Chris Smith , a forward from West Virginia , signed their national letter of intent in April .
UCLA also announced Friday that assistant coach Duane Broussard was elevated to the role of associate head coach .

NEW YORK — Harvey Weinstein was indicted Wednesday on rape and criminal sex act charges , furthering the first criminal case to arise from a slate of sexual misconduct allegations against the former movie mogul .
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said the indictment brings Weinstein “ another step closer to accountability . ”
The announcement came hours after Weinstein 's lawyers said he 'd decline to testify before the grand jury because there was n't enough time to prepare them and “ political pressure ” made an indictment unavoidable .
A statement issued through a Weinstein spokesperson said the 66-year-old film producer , who has denied the allegations , learned of the specific charges and the accusers ' identities only after turning themselves on Friday . With a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon to testify or not , their request for more time was denied , the statement said .
“ Finally , Mr. Weinstein 's attorneys noted that regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein 's personal testimony might be , an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein , ” the statement said .
Vance said in a statement that the Weinstein camp 's “ recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable . ”
“ We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence , it will reject these attacks out of hand , ” Vance said .
Weinstein was charged Friday with raping one woman and committing a criminal sex act by compelling oral sex from another . A grand jury continued hearing evidence in the case , as it had been doing for weeks .
Defendants have the right to testify in a grand jury 's secret proceedings but often do n't , for various reasons .
Freed on $ 1 million bail and electronic monitoring , they were due back in court July 30 , though that date may now be moved up in light of the indictment .
Beyond the two women involved in the case , dozens more women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault in various locales .
They have denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex , and their lawyer , Benjamin Brafman , said Tuesday that Weinstein was “ confident he 's going to clear their name ” in the New York prosecution .
Brafman called the rape allegation “ absurd , ” saying that the accuser and Weinstein had a decade-long , consensual sexual relationship that began before and continued after the alleged 2013 attack .
The woman , who has n't been identified publicly , told investigators Weinstein confined them in a hotel room and raped them
The other accuser in the case , former actor Lucia Evans , has gone public with their account of Weinstein forcing them to perform oral sex at their office in 2004 . The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly .
Vance , a Democrat , came under public pressure from women 's groups to prosecute Weinstein after declining to do so in 2015 , when an Italian model went to police to say Weinstein had groped them during a meeting .
Police set up a sting in which the woman recorded themselves confronting Weinstein and them apologizing for their conduct . But Vance decided there was n't enough evidence to bring charges .
Gov . Andrew Cuomo , also a Democrat , ordered the state attorney general to investigate how Vance handled that matter .
PARIS ( AP ) — The helicopter pilot who was taken hostage in the escape of one of France 's most notorious criminals said the convict 's accomplices beat and threatened them during their kidnapping .
Stephane Buy told RTL radio on Wednesday that two men at a flying club near Paris on Sunday `` forced me ( to take off ) and warned me my family was in danger . ''
First , they made them touch down in a field so others on the breakout team could get onboard . At that point , the engine of the helicopter from the 1960s did n't restart .
Buy said the men hit them on the head and they briefly fell unconscious .
After several attempts , the engine restarted and they headed to Reau Prison to hustle Redoine Faid to freedom .
Buy was later released north of Paris .
HAVANA ( AP ) — Two years after taking office , President Raul Castro widened the niche for private enterprise in Cuba 's state-dominated economy . Capitalism came pouring in .
Slowly at first , then gaining speed , spare rooms for rent became rental homes , which became boutique hotels . Backyard cafes became elegant restaurants and bustling nightclubs , backed with millions in capital from the prosperous Cuban diaspora in Miami , Latin America and Spain . English tutors started citywide private after-school programs . And the booming private economy reached into the Communist-led bureaucracy — paying off inspectors , buying stolen state goods and recruiting talented employees with salaries dwarfing those in the public sector .
Eight years later , on the verge of leaving office , Castro has thrown the brakes on private enterprise in Cuba again , warning of the rapid pace of change and criminal activity . The decision has raised fundamental questions about the nation 's economic path .
The Cuban government proclaimed in August that it was putting a temporary halt on new licenses for bed-and-breakfasts , restaurants and other businesses until it could issue new regulations to control illegality . Entrepreneurs whispered about new regulations coming in a month , maybe two . But summer stretched into fall , fall into the new year , and six months later , Cuba 's private economy remains frozen .
The state-run economy responsible for 70 percent to 80 percent of GDP is stagnant . A once-promising worker-owned cooperative sector has shown little recent growth . Cubans are increasingly wondering when the private economy will be allowed to grow again , and , more broadly , how their government intends to deliver on promises of a sustainable , prosperous socialist system .
`` We 've already been this way several times before , '' economist and Communist Party member Esteban Morales wrote on their blog last week . `` Many of us think that these measures are n't just to organize private enterprise better , as they 've said , but to restrict it . Self-employment generates jobs that the state ca n't . That 's something that has n't been taken advantage of before , and would be very smart to do . ''
The freeze has led to a slowdown in private investment in Cuba at a time of economic fragility and uncertainty . The flow of subsidized oil from Venezuela is dropping as its economy collapses . In 2016 Cuba had its first recession in 20 years and growth last year was 1.6 percent , meaning the economy has remained essentially flat for two years . U.S. tourism , a bright spot , is dropping in the wake of new U.S. restrictions .
The number of self-employed Cubans has grown from 157,000 in 2010 , the year of Castro 's reforms , to 567,000 at the start of last year , roughly 12 percent of the workforce .
`` Self-employed workers are n't asking for neoliberalism or political change , just that they let us work , '' said Camilo Condis , a 32-year-old industrial engineer who rents out an apartment and has a license to work in a restaurant .
Entrepreneurs interviewed by The Associated Press said they and relatives who backed them from overseas were canceling plans to invest in new or expanded businesses .
In 2010 , the Cuban government began allowing 201 types of self-employment , from child 's party clown to real-estate agent . It started issuing licenses for other categories — like restaurant and bed-and-breakfast — that were approved by Castro 's predecessor and brother Fidel during Cuba 's post-Soviet crisis in the 1990s , then frozen again for years .
Some categories of self-employment became vehicles for small businesses with dozens of employees . Their owners ' conspicuous consumption became a source of social tension in a country where the average salary still hovers around $ 25 a month .
A first sign of trouble came in July , when Castro told the National Assembly that `` crimes have been committed . ''
`` There 's information on cases where the same person has two , three , four , even five restaurants . And not in one province , but in several . Someone who 's traveled more than 30 times to different countries , '' Castro said . `` Where did they get the money ? How did they make it ? ''
Castro told assembly members that self-employment would remain part of the economic picture , but `` there 's been a heavy dose of superficiality and an excess of enthusiasm and desire to advance faster than we 're really capable of . ''
A month later , licenses were frozen . Over the fall , about six successful private restaurants were closed after police raids . No information has been released about the seizures but such operations typically occur in cases where officials suspect serious crimes like drug use , money laundering and large-scale buying of stolen goods . The government has also gone on the offensive against pervasive tax evasion , pressuring foreign-owned employers to report their Cuban employees ' incomes , and conducting government assessments of taxes on property sales instead of depending on buyers and sellers to report prices , a notorious source of tax evasion .
Vice President Marino Murillo , the man who oversees Cuba 's economic reforms , told the assembly in December that Cubans would no longer be able to hold more than one self-employment license , meaning Condis , for example , could no longer rent out an apartment and work in a restaurant .
`` There 's great uncertainly , '' economist Omar Everleny Perez said . `` They announced that there 'd be a new law , but it has n't come out and no one dares to start a new enterprise without knowing what it will say . ''

Druze residents of Masada village in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights at a Syria independence day rally on April 17 , 2017 ( AFP Photo/JALAA MAREY )
Masada ( AFP ) - Hundreds of Druze on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights marched Monday for Syrian independence day , carrying portraits of President Bashar al-Assad and chanting anti-Israel slogans .
`` God save Syria ! '' they shouted as they rallied in the town of Masada . `` Down with the occupation ! ''
Israeli officials say there are about 20,000 Druze on the strategic plateau seized by the Jewish state from neighbouring Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War .
Israel subsequently annexed the 1,200 square kilometres ( 460 square miles ) of territory in an action never recognised by the international community .
But the vast majority of Golan Druze have retained Syrian nationality .
The civil war which has ravaged their homeland for the past six years is reflected in local divisions , with Masada opponents of the Assad regime refusing to march behind their picture .
But both sides are united in their opposition to the Israeli occupation , residents told AFP .
`` We retain our Syrian identity and follow the path of national resistance , '' said Nasser Ibrahim , one of the organisers of Monday 's march .
`` With the crisis in Syria , Israel has increased its measures on the Golan , '' said Assad opponent Ayman Abu Jabal , referring to what they called Israeli-ordered changes to the Golan school curriculum .
Israel and Syria are still officially in a state of war , but Israel says it has no wish to get involved in the fighting .
It does , however , carry out strikes against its Lebanese foe Hezbollah , which fights for Assad in Syria .
Last month , Israel struck what it said were Hezbollah targets in Syria , drawing Syrian anti-aircraft missile fire in the worst flare-up between the two governments since the Syrian civil war began in 2011 .

U.S. builders broke ground on fewer homes in March , but the pace of construction so far this year remains stronger than in 2016 .
Housing starts fell 6.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.22 million , the Commerce Department said Tuesday . The setback came after strong gains in a warmer-than-usual February . Groundbreakings on new homes are still 8.1 percent higher through the first three months of this year compared with 2016 .
More Americans are seeking homes as job security has improved with low unemployment . But even with a wave of construction , a dwindling supply of new and existing homes across much of the country has threatened to become a major drag on the housing market .
Jennifer Lee , a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets , suggested that the March decline was likely temporary .
`` Is it the start of a trend ? Likely not , given the strong demand for housing and the low levels of inventory to choose from , '' Lee said .
Despite a winter storm last month , housing starts increased in the Northeast largely because of apartment construction . The pace of groundbreakings tumbled in the Midwest , South and West .
The March decline was likely due in part to an unseasonably temperate January and February , which allowed builders to begin construction earlier .
`` Much warmer-than-usual weather in the first two months of the year pulled starts forward into those months , and March — with more normal temperatures — saw the payback with declines in both single- and multifamily construction , '' said David Berson , chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance .
During the first three months of this year , construction of buildings with at least five units — mainly apartment complexes — has climbed 14.1 percent . Single-family housing starts have risen 5.9 percent .
More properties will likely begin construction in the coming months . Building permits , an indicator of future construction , rose 3.6 percent in March to an annual rate of 1.26 million .
U.S. homebuilders expect rising sales , though they have become somewhat less optimistic . The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Monday dipped to 68 this month from 71 in March . Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as favorable rather than poor . The index has been above 60 since September .
But strengthening demand and builder sentiment have yet to generate enough construction to sufficiently boost the availability of homes . That trend could temper sales growth and weaken affordability , in part because the shortage of homes has pushed up prices .
There were 266,000 new homes for sale last month , up nearly 10 percent from a year earlier . But sales of new homes rose 13 percent over the past year .
Purchases of existing homes have also increased . Yet sales listings of existing homes dropped 6.4 percent over the past year to 1.75 million properties in February , a figure only slightly higher than in January when listings were at an all-time low .

Inshore
The summer snook spawn is in full swing . The beaches and inlets are still your bets for snook fishing . Buck tail jigs and live bait fished near the bottom and around the mouths of the inlets will work well . Always be cautious kayak fishing in the inlet . Strong currents and large boats are things to be aware of . Be sure to have a PFD and all safety equipment for any inlet trip . A good kayak launch is the south side of Jupiter inlet . Try fishing the outside of the north and south jetty as well as drifting the current in the main channel .
Offshore
Expect the offshore kingfish bite to remain consistent especially in the Singer Island area . Fishing the normal depths of 70-150 will put you in the zone for kings . Fishing Boynton Beach area will put you in closer proximity to deep water for the sailfish , mahi and wahoo . If looking to get on a mahi bite look to run out 5-8 miles to find a few fish . Most will be small , but there are chances for a big bull . The wahoo bite should be on the mind this month . Running baits deeper in the water column anywhere from 60-80 ' below surface will give you the best opportunity to land a wahoo .

PARIS ( AP ) — The Latest on the climate summit taking place in Paris ( all times local ) :
9:50 a.m .
Activists pretending to represent a massive wave of oil are holding a protest in Paris at the start of an international climate summit .
A few hundred protesters demonstrated Monday in front of the domed Pantheon monument on Paris ' Left Bank as hundreds of world leaders , financiers and others gathered across town for the summit . The protesters unfurled a massive sheet and carried a huge banner reading `` Not one more euro for energies of the past . ''
CEOs of banks and energy companies are joining more than 50 heads of state at the summit , which is aimed in part at speeding up investment in energy that does n't damage the climate .
French President Emmanuel Macron hosted leading world philanthropists Tuesday morning to encourage more climate-related investment .
___
8:15 a.m .
More than 50 world leaders are gathering in Paris for a summit that President Emmanuel Macron hopes will give new momentum to the fight against global warming , despite U.S. President Donald Trump 's rejection of the Paris climate accord .
Some 3,100 security personnel are fanned out around Paris for Tuesday 's event , including extra patrol boats along the Seine River . Macron will accompany the visiting leaders to the summit site on a river island by boat .
Sean Penn , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Elon Musk are among prominent figures joining the world leaders at the summit , which marks the second anniversary of the Paris accord .
Participants are expected to announce billions of dollars ' worth of projects to help poor countries and industries reduce emissions .
Macron , who 's also using the event to raise their international profile , did not invite Trump .
Light-duty trucks electrify the clean vehicle market
Image : Fuso
New light-duty electric trucks are hitting the roads in the UK , Germany , Japan and the US .
Fuso 's eCanter electric vehicle ( EV ) is now being delivered to a wide range of customers including flour and bread producer Hovis and logistics firm Wincanton .
The firm plans to invest around €2.5 billion ( £2.2bn ) in research and development over the next two years , with the expectation that by 2020 , around a quarter of commercial vehicles driving around will be electric .
It suggests replacing 1,000 conventional trucks with its eCanter model would cut roughly 16,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions .
The company adds the EV could see operators increase their overall energy efficiency by around 60 % when used in conjunction with renewable energy sources .
Managing Director of Mercedes-Benz and Fuso Trucks UK , Mike Belk , said : “ Cities can not function without vehicles and soon more than half the global population will live in these urbanised areas .
“ But in the UK , many cities are in breach of air quality standards . Together with London 's mayor , we share an ambition to participate in the active reduction of harmful pollutants and will develop and build trucks relevant to this aim . ”
Germany 's foreign minister says Poland can rely on their country to condemn distortions of history such as descriptions of Nazi camps in occupied Poland as `` Polish concentration camps . ''
A proposed new law in Poland would outlaw publicly and falsely attributing Nazi Germany 's crimes in World War II to the Polish nation . The U.S. has joined Israel in criticizing it , saying it would impact free expression .
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said Saturday : `` This organized mass murder was carried out by our country and no one else . Individual collaborators change nothing about that . ''
Gabriel added : `` We are convinced that only carefully appraising our own history can bring reconciliation . That includes people who had to experience the intolerable suffering of the Holocaust being able to speak unrestrictedly about this suffering . ''

GUATEMALA CITY ( AP ) — Five people were killed and seven injured by a magnitude 6.9 earthquake that struck Wednesday in western Guatemala near the border with Mexico , Guatemala 's national emergency coordination agency reported .
The fatalities included a woman in the city of San Marcos who was killed by a falling wall and a homeless man in the town of San Sebastian Retalhueleu who was struck by the collapse of part of a church . Both locales were close to the epicenter .
Three women in different departments , or states , died from heart attacks attributed to fright caused by the pre-dawn quake .
Authorities reported moderate damage to homes , some landslides that blocked highways and at least seven people hurt .
“ We greatly mourn the loss of lives , ” President Jimmy Morales said .
The U.S. Geological Survey reported the earthquake was centered 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) southwest of Tajumulco , Guatemala , at a depth of about 111 kilometers ( 69 miles ) .
The emergency coordination agency said the quake struck at 1:29 a.m. local time ( 3:29 EDT ) and was felt throughout the country .
Authorities reported power was knocked out in several departments .
San Marcos , which is home to about 25,000 people , lies 20 kilometers ( 13 miles ) from the epicenter .
The mountainous region is sparsely populated with communities scattered around the base of the dormant Tajumulco volcano . Most residents are small-scale farmers or run small businesses .
Officials said classes in the area would be canceled Wednesday to allow school buildings to be inspected .
The earthquake also rattled the Guatemalan capital , waking residents but without causing damage there .
Across the border in Mexico , Gov . Manuel Velasco of the southern state of Chiapas said via Twitter that there were reports of cracked walls and shattered windows in Huixtla , but so far no injuries . Local Civil Protection authorities said the quake was felt throughout the state .
There was no tsunami warning .

CAIRO ( AP ) — A coalition of eight Egyptian opposition parties and some 150 pro-democracy public figures are calling on voters to boycott the March presidential election , saying it amounts to a `` farce '' or `` absurdity bordering on madness . ''
The incumbent , general-turned-president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi , is virtually certain to win the March 26-28 vote , sweeping aside a face-saving would-be candidate whose last-minute participation spared the government the embarrassment of a one-candidate election .
Tuesday 's call for a boycott by the Civilian Democratic Movement comes just days after five opposition figures , including a 2012 presidential candidate and two top campaign aides for now-arrested presidential hopeful Sami Annan , called for a boycott of the vote and on Egyptians not to recognize the vote 's outcome if it goes ahead .
In this day and age , it is extremely unusual for more than six in 10 Americans ( about 65 percent ) to be viewing the same television program on a given Sunday night , but that 's expected to happen with this weekend 's Super Bowl .
At any other time , they would be tuned in to a hundred different cable channels or streaming media services such as Netflix , watching DVDs , playing video games and who knows what else .
The Super Bowl offers us a rare opportunity for humanity and commonality , when you realize that most everyone else is doing the same thing you are at that exact same time .
It truly has become the ultimate made-for-TV event designed to attract a universal audience , complete with halftime concerts appealing to every musical taste , all kinds of pageantry and splendor and pomp and circumstance . And , oh yes , they manage to play a football game , too .
Another attraction unique to the Super Bowl is the clever commercials debuted especially for the occasion . Who can forget ads portraying Clydesdales playing football , or a horse reunited with its owner during a parade after many years of painful separation ?
The E-Trade commercials of a baby standing in a crib and appearing to talk as a cocky adult also have been memorable , along with many others . The Snickers ad with Betty White playing football , part of its “ You 're not you when you 're hungry ” campaign , is one that comes to mind .
Super Bowl commercials tend to be entertaining and on the humorous side — after all , the main objective involves advertisers seeking attention for their products — but also can be serious and thought-provoking . For example , a “ God made a farmer ” ad in 2013 drew solemn attention to the hardworking farmers of America who are its backbone and the epitome of all qualities we hold dear .
Unfortunately , another such message will not be seen Sunday night . A veterans organization was seeking to run an ad urging fans to stand during the playing of the national anthem before the game .
Innocent enough subject matter for a promotional spot , you might think , but one that the National Football League has rejected , saying it objected to the particular language being used .
What ? The NFL is frowning on a message promoting one of the most important symbols of the American way as a whole : our anthem . It also would have featured a color guard holding the American flag — a banner under which liberty has thrived and also the free enterprise system that made Super Bowl ads possible in the first place .
The proposed anthem ad , of course , was a response to the practice of some players earlier this season kneeling while “ The Star-Spangled Banner ” was played and otherwise showing disrespect for it as well as the flag .
After many fans lambasted this behavior , as did President Trump in their famous S.O.B . remark , and some advertisers pulled commercials from televised games that fans also started boycotting , NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sprang into action .
They maybe , kinda , sorta told players that they ought to perhaps consider standing for the anthem — but never came right out and banned the kneeling or sitting during its playing .
Now the NFL has seen fit to outlaw an ad that justifiably promotes the opposite point of view , one that highlights many sacrifices made by veterans which allow a bunch of pampered athletes to espouse their misguided beliefs . The NFL 's predictable , though unacceptable , position is that it finds the phrase “ please stand ” objectionable due to the political nature of those words .
Yet somehow , the political nature of the players ' actions has not been patently dismissed by the National Football League .
In the midst of such behavior , TV ratings for NFL games dropped by 10 percent during the 2017 season compared to 2016 .
This would indicate that the league leadership is out of touch with rank-and-file Americans , the beer-guzzling , straight-shooting , blue-collar workers who form the core of its fan base and resent the disrespect of our national symbols .
And the decision to reject the Super Bowl ad urging everyone to stand for the anthem shows that the NFL has still not learned the lesson it already should have grasped during the regular season .
Is the NFL that anti-American ?
Amid all the sagging ratings and resulting losses of advertising dollars , the league brass would be well-advised to conduct its own version of a halftime analysis to pinpoint what it has done wrong with the anthem/flag stance so far — a losing one .
If not , even Tom Brady — the great New England Patriots quarterback known for their late-game heroics — wo n't be able to pull the fat out of the fire .

Nelson ended their show early at the USANA Amphitheatre in suburban West Valley City on Sunday night .
They later apologized in a statement posted to their Twitter and Facebook accounts . The 84-year-old country music legend explained : “ The altitude got to me . I am feeling better now and headed for lower ground . ”
Nelson 's publicist did n't immediately respond to a request for further comment Monday .
Nelson was forced to cancel several concerts earlier this year because of what their publicist said was a bad cold .

Josh Rosen is no stranger to tough competition . They starred in the Trinity League in high school . They played in the Pac-12 , which Sports Illustrated crowned “ the conference of quarterbacks ” last year . They even shared a city with one of the other top signal-callers in the country .
To make it at the next level , the former UCLA quarterback has to climb over another deep group of quarterbacks available in the NFL draft , which begins Thursday .
Each of the top five prospects at the position — Rosen , USC 's Sam Darnold , Oklahoma 's Baker Mayfield , Wyoming 's Josh Allen , and Louisville 's Lamar Jackson — offer separate skill sets and personalities . When speaking with reporters last Thursday , New York Giants general manager Dave Gettleman , who has the No . 2 overall pick in Thursday 's draft , likened choosing a quarterback this year to picking a flavor of ice cream at Ben & Jerry 's .
Rosen hopes a team will scoop them up quickly .
“ I think I put the ball where it needs to be very accurately better than everybody else , ” Rosen said in March . “ I think that 's what I do as a quarterback . ”
Rosen 's arm talent is unquestioned among NFL personnel . Their throwing motion , which they have said was never molded by specialized throwing coaches , draws its roots from their days as a top junior tennis player . Their devastating serve ultimately turned into one of the most coveted arms in the draft .
“ Josh Rosen , the most natural thrower in the draft , ” NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock said , “ but they remind me of Sam Bradford , both because they throw the ball naturally , but also the question about durability . Rosen 's been hurt in college . They have an inability to protect themselves in the pocket . He 's a tough kid , but they get hurt a lot . I do n't know if they can survive in the NFL pocket for prolonged periods of time . ”
Despite setting numerous records at UCLA , Rosen missed a combined nine games due to injuries the past two seasons . A shoulder injury cut their sophomore season in half and required surgery , although it was a minor procedure and did not impact their junior campaign during which they ranked second in the country in passing yards per game ( 341.5 ) and set the UCLA single-season passing record .
The bigger injury concern would be their two concussions sustained within a five-week span last year . Despite a month-long break between getting injured against Cal on Nov. 24 and UCLA 's Cactus Bowl game Dec. 26 , Rosen was not cleared to play in what would be their final game in a UCLA jersey .
“ It 's not how you get knocked down , ” Rosen said in March of their injury history , “ it 's how you get back up. ” They then quickly apologized for the cliché .

Play it Forward April 23-29 : Darnold , Rosen can make some history at NFL Draft Rosen attempted 45.2 passes per interception last year , on par with Allen ( 45 passes per interception ) and Jackson ( 43 ) . Of the top five quarterbacks , Darnold threw the most interceptions last year at 13 ( 36.9 pass attempts per interception ) .
Mayfield , the Heisman Trophy winner , was in a stratosphere all their own at 67.3 pass attempts per pick . While undersized , the self-assured Oklahoma quarterback is likely closing in on Rosen in the draft race as the top three teams in the draft – the Browns ( Nos . 1 and 4 ) , Giants ( No . 2 ) and Jets ( No . 3 ) – could all be looking to draft their next great hope under center .
“ From a Jets perspective , will they embrace the swagger of Mayfield ( with the No . 3 pick ) , which is pretty significant , ” Mayock said , “ and they might play really well and be successful , obviously , on Broadway . ”

Romar is uncertain about what will happen Saturday . They spent 15 seasons as the head coach at Washington , but now will walk into Huskies home gym as the opponent .

SEATTLE ( AP ) -- Former Washington coach Lorenzo Romar says it will be `` weird '' walking into the Huskies ' home gym as the opponent for the first time .
He 'll go to the visitors ' locker room and not the coaches ' offices . He 'll sit on the bench at the opposite end of the floor they patrolled for 15 seasons as the head coach at their alma mater . The student section directly behind them - once affectionately called `` Romarville '' - will be chanting and berating the opposing team they help coach .
Perhaps most difficult for Romar , now an assistant for No . 9 Arizona , will be watching players they recruited facing off against the Wildcats .
'' It 's not going to be easy to go back there , '' Romar said in a phone interview this week . '' The No . 1 thing is we 're fighting for a conference championship and that 's the No . 1 focus .
'' Those guys are like your sons that you 're competing against . The 'Dawg Pack , ' we were teammates . Who knows what they 're going to do . It 's just going to be weird . ''
Romar was 298-196 in their career at Washington since arriving in 2002 . There were three Sweet 16 appearances and two outright conference titles . But six straight years of missing the NCAA tournament finally became Romar 's downfall . They were fired last March after going 9-22 .
Romar was responsible for reinvigorating a downtrodden program and developing the Huskies into a perennial Pac-12 contender with a long list of NBA talent shuffling through the program .
Romar was a beloved figure at Washington , for their winning ways and demeanor .
'' People will be happy to see him . I think this city misses them and I know a couple of us do , '' Washington guard Matisse Thybulle said . '' He was loved around here . But at the end of the day , it 's about basketball . ''
Romar was out of work just a few weeks before Arizona coach Sean Miller called him . Romar considered head coaching jobs in other locations , assistant jobs and working in television . Romar 's preference was to not take a job in the Pac-12 so they could avoid matchups with Washington . But when Miller beckoned , Romar realized this was the right job .
A four-year-old girl died of an `` unsurviveable '' head injury when they were knocked down by a pick-up truck driven by their mother , who was using their mobile phone .
Ava Henderson and their brother Lewis , eight , were playing in a compound off Amos Ayre Place in Simonside , South Shields , on Friday , May 27 , last year as their family prepared to spend the bank holiday weekend in a caravan in the Tyne Valley .
But as the youngster tried to restrain the family 's bulldog to stop it getting in the path of the black L200 Mitzubishi pick-up truck , they were struck by the front of the vehicle and suffered serious injuries .
The inquest into Ava 's death , held this morning at Newcastle Civic Centre , heard CCTV showed their mother Laura Henderson has narrowly missed reversing into them before moving forward and knocking them down , before they went under the front driver 's side wheel .
Police investigators said the footage showed Laura had a phone wedged between their ear and shoulder as they prepared to hook up the caravan and manoeuvred the vehicle .
A pathologist listed a series of injuries sustained by the Jarrow girl and concluded a skull fracture was the cause of their death .
Coroner Karen Dilks recorded a conclusion of accidental death .

Welcome to another episode of TV Avalanche , where Brian Grubb and I try to sort out the best , worst , and most interesting things happening in Peak TV .
This week 's episode starts off — after an extended debate between us about “ heh ” vs “ LOL , ” because we are adult humans — with discussions of two very different second-year shows returning this week . With Hulu 's The Handmaid 's Tale ( which I reviewed here ) , our focus is less on the show itself than on why we find it so difficult to watch despite its obvious greatness . From there , we pivot to IFC 's baseball comedy Brockmire ( which I wrote about here ) to talk about both our love of Hank Azaria saying disgusting things and the ways in which the show significantly changed its formula for the new season .
Then we dip into the mailbag , inspired by last week 's mention of Carrie Coon , to talk about other great performances on shows almost nobody watched . And we close out the week with a pair of spoiler segments : an early season check-in on The Americans to figure out whose future we 're worried about most , then some talk of the Westworld season premiere .
As always , you can send questions to tvavalanche @ uproxx.com , or tweet with the hashtag # TVAvalanche . We could definitely use a build-up of questions for when I come back from vacation .

JOHNSON CITY , TN-First-year ETSU head baseball coach Joe Pennucci announced the 2018 baseball schedule for the upcoming season Monday afternoon .
The Bucs will face non-conference opponents from eight different conferences , including the SEC , AAC , Conference USA , ASUN , Big South , OVC , CAA and the Horizon league . ETSU will also combat a stingy SoCon schedule , which opens on the road at Samford March 23 and ends May 17-19 at Wofford .
Non-conference home contests with Tennessee , Northern Kentucky , Eastern Kentucky and Winthrop highlight the home schedule , while stellar contests await the Bucs on the road and in neutral sites .
“ We are extremely excited about this schedule , ” Pennucci said . “ Our early non-conference games will prepare for a tough SoCon schedule . This schedule gives our players a chance to see different parts of the county and compete against some elite opponents . ”
The Bucs open the season Feb. 16 against Northern Kentucky for the ETSU 's earliest opening game since 2015 when the season began Feb 13 . Following a four-game series with the Norse , ETSU will travel to reigning ASUN champion Florida Gulf Coast Feb. 23-25 for a three-game series .
Beginning March 2 , the Bucs will join three other Tennessee schools in the Smokies Tournament , which will take place in Kodak , Tennessee at Smokies Stadium – home of Chicago Cubs Double-A affiliate Tennessee Smokies .
The three-day Tri-State tournament includes contests with Tennessee , Middle Tennessee State and Memphis , respectively .
“ We have an opportunity to play a great series in Smokies Park against some of Tennesse 's finest programs , ” Pennucci said . “ We look forward to seeing how we measure up in this tournament . ”
ETSU then returns home for four dates , hosting Eastern Kentucky March 7 to begin home-and-home that ends in Richmond , Ky. on April 10 . On March 9-11 , the Bucs will welcome reigning Big South regular season champion Winthrop to Thomas Stadium for three games .
Following this series , ETSU hits the road with a three-game series at William & Mary scheduled for March 16-18 . Two days later , the Bucs travel to Knoxville March 20 for their second of three contests with Tennessee ( one neutral , one away , one home ) . The Blue and Gold will host the Vols April 17 to conclude the series .
The seven-game road swing continues straight into conference play , as the Bucs head to Birmingham to take on Samford March 23-25 .
The Bucs will host seven of their next eight games at Thomas Stadium following Samford . After a non-conference matchup at home with UNCA March 27 , the Bucs will host their first conference series with last year 's regular season champion Mercer coming to town March 29-31 .
Following a road contest with Radford April 4 , the Bucs will host VMI in a three-game conference series . ETSU swept the Keydets last season in Johnson City by stringing together a combined 37 runs for the series .
A tough road series awaits the Bucs after leaving the comforts of Johnson City , as defending SoCon champions UNCG welcomes the Bucs to Greensboro , N.C. April 13-15 , with the asupervisorstioned one-game conclusions against Eastern Kentucky and Tennessee sandwiched in between .
A pivotal non-conference series with Tulane is set to take place in New Orleans April 20-22 , followed by a quick return home to face Radford April 24 . Just a few days later , the Bucs will hit the road again and travel to Cullowhee , N.C. to take on Western Carolina in conference play April 27-29 .
The final two home conference series follow WCU , as the Bucs host former head coach Tony Skole 's Citadel squad May 4-6 before welcoming Furman in a revenge series May 11-13 . Furman eliminated ETSU , 8-6 , to advance to the conference championship series last season .
In between the Citadel series and Furman series stands another single-game road matchup with Conference-USA member Marshall in Huntington , West Virginia May 8 . Following Furman is the final non-conference game of the season in Asheville , N.C. against UNCA a week later , May 15 .
The final series of the season happens in Spartanburg , S.C. against Wofford May 17-19 . This will lead into the SoCon tournament , which will begin May 22 at Fluor Field in Greenville , S.C . The winner of the tournament earns an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament .

It 's official : LiAngelo Ball and LaMelo Ball are heading to Europe in January to play professional basketball . To celebrate LaVar Ball 's youngest boys signing with Lithuania club Prienu Vytautas—which happened to coincide with Tina Ball 's 50th birthday—the Big Baller Brand pushed out posts on social media in support of Gelo and Melo pursuing their dreams “ the Big Baller way . ”

“ ‪It 's not about the money for the Ball Brothers , ” the Triple Bs proclaimed . “ They have a passion to play Basketball and to experience playing as pros was the Goal . They have accomplished this mission and are excited to be playing on the same team to top it off . ”
It 's easy to believe that LiAngelo and LaMelo did n't sign for financial reasons , since they wo n't likely get much in return from BC Prienai .
LiAngelo , LaMelo sign six-month deal on low-level Lithuania team with coach and GM that speak ZERO English . Club is MONTHS behind on checks , and I 'm told Ball Bros can peak at $ 4000 total . Max . Might not even get it . Cluture Shock . — David Pick ( @ IAmDPick ) December 11 , 2017

And while the prospects of LaVar 's “ Wild Boy ” making an impact in Europe seem dubious , keep in mind that other young phenoms have made their mark on the continent at their age or younger .
LaMelo Ball turns pro at 16 . At their age Luka Doncic was already scoring in the Euroleague . Ricky Rubio debuted in the ACB at 14 . — David Pick ( @ IAmDPick ) December 12 , 2017
Granted , Melo is no Luka Doncic , who might be the No . 1 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft . And if there 's any member who compares to Ricky Rubio—as much for their passing and defense as for their wayward shot—it 's probably Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball .
What 's more , both Rubio and Doncic had the benefit of coming up through the European club system , learning that style of basketball along the way . LaMelo and LiAngelo , meanwhile , have been steeped in the American AAU culture , which tends to promote the individual over the team .
Whatever the end result may be , at least Gelo and Melo can enjoy this moment over the holidays before hopping on a plane and flying nearly 6,000 miles to embark on their unique basketball adventure , for better or worse .
REFUGIO , Texas ( AP ) — A natural gas pipeline has exploded in South Texas , in a fiery display that lit up the sky and could be seen for miles .
Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt . Nathan Brandley says the explosion occurred early Wednesday near Refugio ( ray-FYOO'-ee-oh ) , a rural community north of Corpus Christi , about 15 miles from the Texas Coast .
Brandley says no one was hurt and that there are no refineries or plants nearby .
They say it 's too early to know what triggered the explosion .
Brandley says crews are working to close the line and extinguish the flames .
Mishaps with transmission lines are not uncommon . In the past two decades , the U.S. government has recorded more than 2,000 accidents on gas transmission lines across the country .
Pentagon can not accept Russia 's victory over terrorists in Syria
Russian President Vladimir Putin paid a visit to Russia 's Hmeymim airbase in Syria , where they ordered to pullout Russian troops from Syria . Speaking to the military , Putin stressed that the Russian armed forces , together with the Syrian army , have defeated a massive group of international terrorists in Syria .
`` In this connection , I made a decision : a significant part of the Russian military contingent in the Syrian Arab Republic will return home , to Russia , '' the Supreme Commander-in-Chief said . `` You are returning to your homes , to your relatives , parents , wives , children , friends as victors . Your Motherland is waiting for you , friends . Good luck , I thank you for your service , '' Putin said .
The President added that in case of attempts to break peace in Syria , terrorists will face the strikes , `` which they have not seen before . ''
According to member of the Association of Military Political Scientists , Andrei Koshkin , Putin 's remarks about the future targeted the political forces that oversee terrorists . `` If they think to use the territory of Syria again for hostilities , then Russia would come to stop them again . In a nutshell , Putin made it clear that Russia would not leave Syria alone , without the help of the Russian Air Force , '' the expert told Pravda.Ru .
Commenting on the statement from officials of the Pentagon , who believe that it was the US-led coalition that contributed most to the destruction of the Islamic State * terrorist organisation , Andrei Koshkin noted that one could also recall statements from radical Islamists , who said that they did not lose , but changed the tactics .
`` We must understand that the media confrontation continues . The Pentagon can not accept the fact of Russia 's victory in Syria . The US-led coalition was bombing terrorists for a year . It just so happens that Russia has solved the problem despite all the efforts of those , who think of themselves as the strongest army of the world . Their self-esteem has been hurt , '' said the expert .
As for the part of the Russian contingent that is going to stay in Syria for the time being , Andrei Koshkin believes that it will most likely be deminers , employees of the Center for reconciliation of the parties , and crews of anti-aircraft missile systems that protect Russian facilities in Hmeymim and Tartous .

Berkeley and West Hollywood already have laws , now San Francisco is poised to become the first major American city to ban the sale of fur . Supervisors will vote tomorrow despite criticism from retailers who say it will cost them millions in lost revenue each year.It 's estimated somewhere between 30 and 50 retailers in San Francisco sell fur . The big ones in Union Square include Macy 's , Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.For decades they 've been the target of demonstrations by animal rights activists but soon there may be nothing left to protest . Fur sales in stores and online will be banned under a measure sponsored by city Supervisor Katy Tang.Tang is a long time animal rights advocate , who does n't eat meat . They say , `` I believe its necessary to pass this legislation because around the world there are 50 million , maybe even upwards of 100 million animals slaughtered each year solely for the purpose of providing us fur . `` The City estimates the ban will cost retailers about $ 10,000,000 a year in lost sales . Retailers peg it much higher at 45 million annually and say outlawing fur will also tarnish the brand of Union Square as an international shopping destination . Karin Flood is head of the Union Square Business Improvement District.She believes customers will simply go elsewhere to shop , like Las Vegas or Los Angeles . Flood says , `` this is certainly an ethical issue and San Francisco has values , but the question is should these values be imposed on individuals and their right to choose what they do and how they shop . `` Anti-fur activists recently rallied on the steps of city hall . Matthew Dempsky was one of the protestors with a group called Direct Action Everywhere . He 's hoping San Francisco will set a trend by passing the legislation.Dempsky says. `` pretty soon it 'll go nationwide and people will then really have to go out of their way if they want to continue buying fur . `` Flood represents 30 stores in Union Square that sell fur and says their clients worry what other regulations could be down the line . `` We wonder what 's next ... will it be leather . Will it be cashmere . `` If the law passes , it would take effect January 2019 . There are rumblings retailers may sue .

Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas publicly mourned the passing of Archbishop Hilarion Capucci , 94 .
Capucci , who died on Sunday in Rome , was an active supporter of the PLO and later the Palestinian Authority and Hamas terror organization .
In 1974 Capucci was caught using their diplomatic protection to smuggle guns for the PLO and sentenced to 12 years in prison . Capucci was released four years later , however , after the Pope made a special request on their behalf .
Following the Islamic Revolution in 1979 , Capucci maintained ties with the Iranian regime and later became a support of the Hamas terror group backed by Iran .
Abbas called Capucci a `` great warrior , '' and in 2013 presented them with a medal of honor in Rome .
Terrorist organization Fatah said Capucci 's death pained `` every Palestinian 's heart '' and expressed pride in `` militant '' Cappuci and their activities .
In 2002 , Capucci participated in a pro-Palestinian parade in Rome and said , `` Greetings to the sons of the Intifada and to the martyrs who go and fight as if they were going to a party ... We want our land , or we will die with dignity ... Intifada till victory . ''
Eight years later , Capucci participated in the failed attempt to run the Israeli security blockade of Gaza on board the Mavi Marmara , the Turkish vessel whose seizure sparked six years of diplomatic tensions between Jerusalem and Ankara .

Tom Brady has never lost in Minnesota , with their latest game in the land of lakes this weekend at the Super Bowl of course looming as the largest yet .
Well , long before all this football success , Brady actually endured a couple of memorable failures in the state . They came during those treasured visits to their family 's farm outside the tiny town of Browerville .
First , there was their grandfather 's dog , Tippy . Little Tommy ignored the advice of their elders one day and decided to feed Tippy a bone .
`` I bent down to give them a kiss , and they bit through my lip , '' Brady said . `` That was pretty rough . ''
Then there was their ill-fated debut with chewing tobacco , which they persuaded their uncles to let them sample during the half-hour ride back to the farm from their fishing expedition on the lake .
`` They said , 'Look , if we give it to you , you ca n't spit it out until you get home , ' Of course they give it to me , and within five minutes I 'm outside of the car , throwing up all over the place , '' Brady said . `` And I do n't think I 've had much chewing tobacco since then . ''
Brady spent plenty more time in central Minnesota as they aged into a star quarterback and eventually one of the most famous people on the planet . They still make a priority to visit in the offseasons with their wife and children , trying to continue a tradition they reflected upon fondly and often during news conferences this week .
`` I 've come here my entire life since I was a baby . I 've been coming to Minnesota in summers and winters . I loved the experience . I loved the life here , '' Brady said . `` Some of my greatest memories as a kid were coming here and milking cows with my grandpa ; hanging out in their silos and in the haystack above their barn ; going out to where they would pasteurize the milk and pull the cream off the top of the milk in the morning ; and shooting their ( .22-caliber rifle ) at targets in the backyard , and catching sunfish with my uncles . It was great . I love being here . It 's a great state . Obviously , I love the people . Being that my mom 's from here , I 'm proud of that . ''
Galynn Johnson was the middle child between two boys , the 1961 homecoming queen at Browerville High School who moved to California and met Tom Brady , who would later add senior to their name when a certain five-time Super Bowl winner was born . The couple returned to Todd County , where the prairie meets the forest a little less than a 2 ? -hour drive northwest of downtown Minneapolis , in 1969 for their wedding .
Brady and the Patriots will play the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday , when several family members will be in attendance at U.S. Bank Stadium .
`` These tickets are pretty tough to come by , '' Brady said . `` But I 'm trying my best to accommodate everyone . It is very special . ''
The group will include Paul Johnson , who at age 50 is 10 years older than their quarterback cousin . He 's an entrepreneur who has stayed around their whole life . After CBS announcer Jim Nantz mentioned Browerville to Brady during New England 's AFC championship celebration , Johnson has been the subject of a barrage of media coverage that 's highly unusual for a quiet burg of 793 people .
`` It 's fun . I would n't want to be a celebrity , I know that , '' Johnson said , conducting an interview with The Associated Press from their ice-fishing shack on one of the region 's bounty of frozen lakes , with the clinking of their propane tank audible in the background . `` We 're just so proud of him . ''
The Johnsons of Browerville quickly became Patriots fans after Brady was drafted in 2000 , veering away from the home-state Vikings .
`` We clearly remember the game where Drew Bledsoe got hurt , '' Johnson said , `` and the rest is history . ''
Johnson 's 22-year-old son , Benton , is a University of St. Thomas senior in St. Paul who was fortunate enough to get on the ticket list for Sunday , too . This will be their first in-person Super Bowl , but they and their 25-year-old sister , Kenley , have been lifelong fans of the Patriots .
`` It was probably the coolest thing on earth to say that Tom Brady was your cousin , '' said Benton , who always carried photo evidence of their relation to disprove any doubting peers at school .
Even for young Benton , visits to Browerville from the Brady clan made a major impression .
`` It was always like , 'Mom , when are they coming ? ' '' Benton said . `` I always told my parents I would move to California because I just loved seeing them and the stories they would tell . ''
Brady 's mother underwent breast cancer treatments in 2016 and made a stirring appearance on the field this season before New England 's game against the Atlanta Falcons . Brady has beamed this week every time he 's spoken about their family , proudly reporting that their mom remains cancer free .
`` My parents mean everything to me , '' Brady said . `` They 've been here by my side every step of the way . ''

CEDAR RAPIDS , Iowa ( AP ) — An Iowa county agreed Wednesday to pay $ 285,000 to an Arizona man who was arrested , transported across the country and jailed for 68 days for a crime that they did n't commit .
The payment will resolve a federal lawsuit that 23-year-old Joseph McBride filed in early January against Linn County and its longtime top prosecutor , County Attorney Jerry Vander Sanden .
John Harris , chairperson of the county board , confirmed the unusually quick settlement Wednesday to The Associated Press , moments after it was signed . They said the county is self-insured and the payout will come from its insurance fund .
`` A person does n't like to think that mistakes can be made , but everybody 's human , '' they said . `` We just have to acknowledge our mistakes , in most cases right them and move on . ''
The settlement does n't include a formal admission of liability or an apology to McBride , who is black . But their attorney , Tom Frerichs , praised assistant county attorney Bob Hruska , who negotiated the settlement , for `` his prompt and thoughtful attention to this case . ''
`` He did the right thing for the people in Linn County to bring this case to a quick resolution , '' Frerichs said .
McBride was wrongly accused of participating in a Jan. 1 , 2017 , home invasion in Cedar Rapids in which a 27-year-old man was beaten with a handgun and robbed . McBride had grown up in Cedar Rapids but moved to Phoenix in November 2015 , and had evidence showing they were 1,500 miles ( 2,400 kilometers ) away from the scene when the crime occurred .
Vander Sanden signed a complaint charging McBride and two others with first-degree robbery , which carries up to 25 years in prison . Investigators from the Cedar Rapids Police Department never interviewed McBride . But they were implicated after the victim said they did their own investigation on Facebook and told detectives they were `` 90 percent sure '' an account linked to McBride belonged to one of the assailants .
Authorities arrested McBride last August at their home in Phoenix , where they were ordered jailed on a $ 50,000 cash-only bond . They were taken to Iowa on a private prison van that made stops at jails in Nevada , Colorado and Missouri and cost Linn County taxpayers $ 2,500 . Even before they arrived in Cedar Rapids on Sept. 19 , they insisted they were innocent and had cellphone photos proving they were in Glendale , Arizona , hours before the robbery .
McBride 's attorney filed notice of the alibi defense Oct. 9 , providing names of witnesses . One attested that they celebrated New Year 's Eve with McBride in Phoenix and spent the next day with them rearranging a storage unit . Prosecutors dropped the case and had McBride released from jail on Oct. 31 , a day after one of the robbery participants identified another man as the third suspect as part of a cooperation agreement . That suspect , a convicted felon with a violent past , has n't been charged .
McBride 's lawsuit alleged that the criminal complaint falsely contended police had `` phone records and social media '' evidence showing they conspired with the other two suspects . In reality , McBride 's only connection was that they were a Facebook friend with one of them .
The lawsuit had sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for McBride , who works at an Arizona dog treats factory .
The settlement marks the second $ 285,000 payment an Iowa county has recently made to one of Frerichs ' clients over claims that they were the victims of a shoddy investigation . Last year , neighboring Johnson County paid that sum to settle a lawsuit filed by an attorney who spent 16 days in jail for a crime they did n't commit .

A cocktail garden party and a glittering ball were two of the highlights of the busy programme organised by Brian and Trisha Rollo in 2017/18 , which included the popular Carols in the Chamber event at Christmas .
The couple also took part in St Catherine 's Hospice 's sponsored Santa Dash in December , while Trisha has been a regular customer at the charity 's Lune Street shop – visiting the occasion-wear department for outfits to wear for official engagements and making use of the hat hire service .
The pair 's efforts raised £5,979 for St Catherine 's Hospice and £6,079 to Galloway 's Society for the Blind , in Penwortham , which supports blind and partially sighted people across Lancashire . They also made numerous other donations to smaller local charities and community groups .
Coun Rollo said : “ What we have really enjoyed is meeting so many different local people and community groups who are doing some amazing work in their areas . There really are some wonderful people in Preston , including at St Catherine 's and Galloway 's .
“ We chose to support the two charities because they are local causes , supporting local people , and we wanted to make a contribution towards that . ”
Emma Jacovelli , head of community engagement at St Catherine 's , in Lostock Hall , said : “ We 've been delighted to have the support of the Mayor and Mayoress over the past year and are extremely grateful to them – not only for the impressive funds raised , but for raising the profile of the charity through their official engagements and events , and even through the clothes Trisha wore .
“ We 're pleased to hear they enjoyed the experience and there 's no doubt that their guests did too . The money raised will be used to care for local people facing conditions like cancer , motor neurone disease and heart failure – helping them to have quality of life , to the end of life . ”
Emma Russ , fund-raising manager at Galloway 's , said : “ It 's been an absolute pleasure to be one of the chosen charities for the Mayor of Preston during the last year . The money that has been raised is a phenomenal amount that will go a long in helping us support more people through sight loss . In addition to the money raised , the mayor and mayoress have attended many Galloway 's events throughout the year and have developed a true understanding of how their support has made a life changing difference . ”

NICOSIA , Cyprus ( AP ) — A United Nations envoy says progress has been made on a compromise formula regarding how security will be enforced after ethnically divided Cyprus is reunified .
But Espen Barth Eide told the AP there 's still `` a long way to go '' on a structure meeting the security concerns of rival Greek and Turkish Cypriots , as well as the east Mediterranean island 's `` guarantors '' — Greece , Turkey and Britain .
Eide said after talks with Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades Wednesday that the U.N. is assisting in `` structuring '' the deal .
The complex issue of security has long stumped peace talks . Breakaway Turkish Cypriots insist on keeping Turkish troops and granting Turkey intervention rights in a reunified Cyprus , something which Greek Cypriots reject .
Cyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup aimed at union with Greece .
Taipei ( Taiwan News ) -- Twitter user Jeff Wang took this photo of the 2017 Taipei Lantern Festival on Feb. 12 as they sketched a drawing of the site .
The Taipei Lantern Festival was held on the city 's west side for the first time in its 20-year history from Feb. 4-12 . The biggest and most popular event during the festival was the Ximen Lantern Festival Parade on the official day of the Lantern Festival Feb. 11 , which attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors that day .
It 's official : Boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will come out of retirement to face UFC star Conor McGregor in a fight that has already attracted big bets in Las Vegas .
The fight will be held Aug. 26 in Las Vegas .
Mayweather is currently a -1,100 favorite at the Westgate SuperBook , with McGregor paying back 700 .
The Westgate posted odds on the fight in February , with Mayweather opening as a -2,500 favorite . The early action was almost all on the underdog McGregor , driving the price down on Mayweather to as low as -800 .
On May 30 , the Westgate took a $ 50,000 bet on Mayweather at -800 , two weeks before the fight was made official . That bet would net a $ 6,250 profit with a Mayweather win .
As of Tuesday afternoon , 92 percent of the bets placed on the fight at the Westgate were on McGregor , including multiple $ 1,000 bets .
`` There 's going to be a lot of McGregor support , '' said Westgate assistant manager Jeff Sherman , who oversees the boxing odds . `` A lot of tickets , a lot of probably $ 20 bets , $ 100 bets that might keep the price down . But I know you 're going to see , once the fight is officially announced , larger wagers come in and support Mayweather . ''
Las Vegas sportsbook operator CG Technology also had seen primarily McGregor money before the fight was announced .
`` The ticket count is a lot [ on McGregor ] to three [ on Mayweather ] , '' Jason Simbal , vice president of risk for CG Technology , told ESPN on Tuesday .
But in the first few hours after the fight was made official Wednesday , CG Technology took a $ 45,000 bet on Mayweather .
The fight had already generated close to $ 100,000 in betting handle at the SuperBook .
`` Usually , you put these up in anticipating of a marquee event to try to draw some handle , but it 's usually the smaller variety , '' Sherman said Tuesday . `` We 've seen some dime wagers [ $ 1,000 ] on McGregor and the support that we saw on Mayweather . There are people who are betting a little more than usual for a fight that has n't been announced yet . ''
MGM sportsbook managers found out the fight was official Wednesday afternoon by watching TV reports and began the process of putting up the odds for a fight they expect to be a massive betting event .
`` It 's going to be huge , '' MGM sportsbook manager Jeff Stoneback said . `` It may not bring in the money of the Pacquiao-Mayweather fight , but I think it will exceed that fight in number of tickets . `` ?
Sandra Valin , who is transgender , was born in 1974 and said growing up in Uruguay , their mom would n't allow them to leave home alone .
`` When I was a kid I was a target because I was flamboyant and feminine , it was horrible , and it did n't end with the dictatorship - the persecution continued into the 1990s , '' Valin said .
Effectively cut out of Uruguay 's formal economy , Valin relied on sex work to survive .
Uruguayan state persecution of transgender people has had a devastating effect on the trans community . That admission is part of a package of bills drafted by the executive branch of the Uruguayan government with the express purpose of improving the lives of trans people .
In 2016 , a government census found that 873 Uruguayans identify as transgender . The census also found that 75 percent of the trans population did n't finish high school and that a quarter are cut off from family relations .
`` Trans people do n't reach old age , '' said Tania Ramirez , who works for the Ministry of Social Development in Uruguay . `` They are a vulnerable community and the police and the state detained and tortured trans people during the dictatorship of the 1970s and 80s and these tactics continued into the democratic era . ''
Now the Uruguayan government is looking at a proposal to make amends .
The general assembly is currently reviewing a proposal that will create scholarships , set up affirmative action , and allow people to change their name and sex on official documents without approval from a judge .
It would also create a monthly pension for transgender people born before 1975 – as a way to make reparations for those who were targeted by the government .
Valin would be eligible for those reparations . Things are easier for them now – they live in a wealthy neighborhood and walks dogs for a living .
`` I am the pet sitter , it 's so funny because I work from the beach , '' said Valin . `` I love my job . ''
But they ca n't walk dogs forever and they do n't have a stable pension to look forward to – they say that government subsidy would really help .

Labor Agriculture spokesperson Joel Fitzgibbon gave notice in Federal Parliament overnight that they will propose legislative amendments to ban live sheep exports today .
Mr Fitzgibbon announced their move when declaring Labor 's support for new laws brought by Agriculture Minister David Littleproud for tougher penalties for live exporters who breach animal welfare standards .
`` It will put a stop to the summer trade at the first immediate opportunity and it will phase out the live sheep trade over a five-year period , '' Mr Fitzgibbon said .
Their amendments mirror the private members bill of Farrer MP Sussan Ley .
Mr Fitzgibbon says a Labor government would support up-scaling of Australia 's sheep meat processing to replace the loss of live exports .
The coming vote will reveal on the floor of parliament the Coalition 's support for the sheep trade . Some backbench MPs have warned it is a divisive issue in their electorates .
Ms Ley 's bill did not get enough support to make it to a vote , despite backing from Victorian MPs Sarah Henderson and Jason Wood . Queensland MP Warren Entsch has subsequently announced they wanted to see live sheep exports banned .
Mr Littleproud is a strong supporter of live sheep exports and has moved to boost animal welfare standards .
They visited Middle Eastern customers last week to reassure them of Australia 's support for the trade .
They have committed to implement all 23 recommendations from the McCarthy review into the live exports in the northern hemisphere summer , which include :
Heat stress will replace mortality rates as the key measure of animal welfare .
The reportable mortality level will be halved , from two to one per cent .
An allometric stocking density system will be introduced , providing for around 39pc more space for sheep on the voyage , and reducing stocking density by about 28pc .
Mr Littleproud said their reforms were designed to support the farm sector and future-proof the sheep trade against future animal welfare controversies .
“ I want to make sure there is a legacy , that no matter who comes in after me , that this can not be broken down , ” they said when they released the McCarthy Review in Sydney .
Mr Fitzgibbon has said it 's not right for Australia “ to continue into the future a trade which ca n't meet reasonable community animal welfare standards ” .

Kaleb Jr. and Archer , two mixed-breeds , are among more than 1,000 dogs that have been transported to safety from Puerto Rico by rescue group The Sato Project since Hurricane Maria roared ashore the U.S. territory .

Since 2001 , The Sato Project has been rescuing abandoned and abused dogs from Puerto Rico , where limited spay and neuter practices have lead to unwanted litters of puppies . The organization , which gets its name from the Puerto Rican slang for stray dog , `` sato , '' typically focuses its efforts on an area known as Dead Dog Beach in Yabucoa municipality in the southeast corner of the island , where many unwanted canines are dumped .
But the situation was exacerbated when Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane on Sept. 20 , according to Christina Beckles , founder and president of The Sato Project . Now , the group is rescuing dogs from all over the island .
`` The amount of dogs that need help now is beyond anything I 've ever seen before in all those years of rescue , '' Beckles told ABC News in a telephone interview Friday .

Hurricane Maria ravaged homes and knocked out the island 's entire power grid . The government of Puerto Rico put the official death toll as a result of Maria at 64 . But after some independent analyses found the count was likely significantly higher , Puerto Rico 's governor ordered a review of all deaths that have occurred since the storm struck .
Without power and access to clean water for weeks following the hurricane , animal welfare groups like The Sato Project were unable to provide veterinary services on the island , such as spaying and neutering . And with all commercial airline cargo space sequestered by FEMA and the U.S. military , The Sato Project could n't to fly a dog weighing more than 20 pounds off the island .
Though the group 's operations are back up and running , Beckles said the influx of puppy litters born in the storm 's aftermath is overwhelming .
`` Now we 're seeing the effect of that . We 're getting more puppies than I have ever seen before , '' Beckles said . `` I truly feel that we have lost seven years of work with Maria , which is heartbreaking . ''

It 's been more than four months since the storm hit , yet nearly half a million customers were still without power in Puerto Rico at the end of January , according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Ninety-six percent of the island has access to drinking water , according to the Puerto Rican government , though a `` boil water '' advisory remains in effect .
FEMA announced Tuesday that the agency 's food and water aid to Puerto Rico is no longer needed for emergency operations , citing the restoration of the commercial food and water supply chain and the availability of private suppliers .
The devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria has forced tens of thousands of people who were living in Puerto Rico to come to the U.S. mainland . Hunter College 's Center for Puerto Rican Studies estimates that Puerto Rico will lose up to 470,335 residents , or 14 percent of its population , from 2017 to 2019 .
`` We have the hundreds of thousands of dogs that were already stray and abandoned on the streets , and now those numbers are increasing because people are abandoning their dogs as they leave the island or they ca n't afford to care for them , '' Beckles said . `` And it 's not ending anytime soon . ''
The Sato Project
On average , the Sato Project rescues and rehabilitates about 350 dogs every year in Puerto Rico and flies them to New York for adoption . The organization has donated generators , emergency veterinary supplies , more than 200 dogs beds and over 50,000 pounds of dog food in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria .
In addition to finding forever homes for rescued pups , The Sato Project has reunited 183 owned dogs with their families since the storm . One of the dogs was a medical support animal owned by a diabetic woman , who had to leave their home in Puerto Rico behind because they did n't have access to insulin after the hurricane . They had been in two diabetic comas without their beloved companion at their side to sense their sugar levels .
The Sato Project
The two puppies featured in this year 's Puppy Bowl on Animal Planet have already found loving homes in New York . Kaleb Jr. has been renamed Murphy by their adoptive mom and Archer 's new family has renamed them Maddox .
The four-legged all-stars will go paw-to-paw in Sunday 's furry competition with other puppies rescued from areas devastated by natural disasters last year . Animal Planet worked with 48 different animal shelters and rescue organizations from 25 U.S. states and territories to fill the adorable rosters of Team Fluff and Team Ruff .
`` There 's no need to ever buy a dog , '' Beckles said . `` You can find whatever dog your heart desires at your local shelter . ''

JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM , Hawaii ( AP ) — The Pentagon is changing the name of the U.S. military 's Pacific headquarters to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command , in a bow to America 's growing connection to India and its expanding security role in the region .
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is formally announcing the name change during a ceremony marking a leadership handover at the command . U.S. Navy Adm. Philip Davidson is taking over PACOM from Adm. Harry Harris , who has been nominated to be the next U.S. ambassador to South Korea .
The change is largely symbolic in nature . It carries no fundamental shifts in troops , military missions or other Pentagon activities . Instead , Mattis says , it 's a recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific oceans .
The U.S. and India have been forging stronger security ties in recent years .
DUBLIN , Ohio ( AP ) — The two biggest figures at the Memorial , Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods , managed to carve out some private time at the back of the 10th tee amid a mass of people Wednesday at Muirfield Village .
Some of it was just catching up . The two most prolific winners of major championship had not seen each other since April at the Masters .
And the tournament host had some encouraging words .
Nicklaus complimented Woods on their swing , and then told them what Woods has felt for the last few months .
“ He was saying that my swing is starting to look a little bit better , ” Woods said . “ And I said , ‘ Yeah , I 'm really not that far away , ' and they totally agreed . They just kept urging me to be patient with it because they could see that I 've made some pretty big strides this year , and not far away from putting it all together . ”
The Memorial presents such an opportunity .
Woods has won at the course Jack built a record five times . The most recent victory was in 2012 , when they took command from behind the 16th green by turning a potential bogey into a chip-in birdie that Nicklaus still thinks is one of the best shots they ever saw .
The most recent appearance ? That 's different .
Woods last played the Memorial in 2015 . In the last few months before a series of back surgeries , Woods shot 85 in the third round , the worst score of their career . Because an uneven number of players made the cut , Woods teed off Sunday morning as a single and shot 74 .
“ I tried , and unfortunately on this golf course , hitting it as bad as I did , it just was n't good enough , ” Woods said .
As for playing as a single ? Woods smiled .
“ I did n't want to have anyone watch me play the way I was playing , ” they said .
Rory McIlroy was standing at the side of the room as Woods spoke , listening to a player with 90 victories worldwide talking about the time they signed their name to an 85 on their scorecard . McIlroy recalled their highest round at 83 in the South African Open in 2007 , their seventh tournament as a pro .
McIlroy climbed the steps to the stage as Woods was leaving and said to him , “ Aside from your 85 , you have won here five times . ”
Those are the memories Woods hopes to draw from when the Memorial begins Thursday on a Muirfield Village course in its usual mint condition . The tournament is two weeks before the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills , and it has the kind of field that makes it feel like a mini-major .
Only two players from the top 10 in the world are missing : Jon Rahm and U.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka .
Justin Rose is coming off a victory at Colonial , their ninth consecutive year with a victory somewhere in the world . Justin Thomas is making their debut at No . 1 in the world , an achievement that does n't come with a trophy but one that meant enough to them that they stayed up later than usual when they got home after The Players Championship to see the world ranking page with their name at the top . They took a screen shot .
“ Seeing every golfer in the world behind my name is a pretty fun thing , ” Thomas said .
Dustin Johnson , who does n't appear to be concerned with much in life , conceded they were eager to get back the No . 1 ranking they held for 15 months . This is their first tournament since they lost the No . 1 spot to Thomas .
Nicklaus was around the first and 10th tee boxes during the pro-am to greet them all , a list that includes Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler .
Woods has made strides since their return from a fourth back surgery , including a runner-up finish at the Valspar Championship in March , and an exciting charge at Bay Hill that ended with a tee shot out of bounds on the 16th hole .
Nicklaus suggested on Tuesday that Woods has to learn anew how to win because it has been five years since their last victory .
McIlroy understood what they meant , having gone 18 months between victories until they won the Arnold Palmer Invitational . McIlroy started this year with good chances at Abu Dhabi and Dubai , and then they broke through at Bay Hill .
“ As long as you put yourself in contention more and more and keep knocking on the door , sooner or later you 're going to step through , ” McIlroy said . “ And then with that , experience will do great things for you going forward . ”
Woods has n't been within five shots of the lead going into Sunday since Bay Hill . They never got going at the Masters or at Quail Hollow , and while they had a season-best 65 in the third round at The Players Championship , they still are 11 shots out of the lead . The idea this week is to get in range .
“ The last few times that I 've had a chance , I 've felt very comfortable , ” they said . “ Hopefully I can just shoot the low round when I need it . ”

( Reuters ) - World Cup-bound Nigeria conceded a late penalty and were held to a 1-1 draw by the Democratic Republic of Congo in a friendly in Port Harcourt planned to give them a fitting send-off to next month 's tournament in Russia . Nigeria , who head to Europe to continue their preparations with a game against England on Saturday , took a 15th-minute lead through Dutch-born defender William Troost Ekong . But they gave away a spot-kick in the 78th minute which striker Ben Malomgo converted for the equaliser . Nigeria will also play a friendly against the Czech Republic before they head to Russia , where they face Croatia , Iceland and Argentina in Group D .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — A wide-ranging White House plan to combat America 's opioid crisis contains a striking element : It calls on the Justice Department to seek the death penalty for some drug traffickers . Opponents call that a return to failed drug-war tactics , and some legal experts question its constitutionality and effectiveness .
A look at President Donald Trump 's proposal :
WHAT IS THE PLAN ?
The push for greater use of the death penalty is just part of a sweeping plan that includes stiffer penalties for drug peddlers as well as expanding access to treatment and recovery efforts . It 's in keeping with the Trump administration 's tough-on-crime approach to the opioid abuse epidemic that claimed a record 42,000 people in the U.S. in 2016 . Trump , who mused openly that countries like Singapore have fewer issues with addiction because they harshly punish drug dealers , said they want the Justice Department to seek the `` ultimate penalty '' when possible .
___
CAN They DO THAT ?
Maybe . Trump is n't proposing a new law , but is encouraging the Justice Department to enforce existing laws more vigorously .
The Federal Drug Kingpin Act allows federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in cases when someone is intentionally killed during a drug deal or in furtherance of a drug enterprise .
There are other federal laws that could potentially allow death penalty prosecutions of `` kingpins '' when large amounts of money and drugs are involved , even if there has not been a killing . But no administration , Democratic or Republican , has ever pursued and secured a death sentence under those laws .
It 's not clear that death sentences for drug dealers , even for those whose product causes multiple deaths , would be constitutional , said Doug Berman , a law professor at Ohio State University . They predicted the issue would be litigated extensively and ultimately settled by the U.S. Supreme Court .
`` The death penalty is uncertain as a constitutionally permissible punishment without that connection to an intentional killing , '' Berman said .
Trump 's attorney general , Jeff Sessions , vowed to seek the death penalty under federal law `` whenever appropriate '' against drug dealers who `` show no respect of human dignity and put their own greed ahead of the safety and even the lives of others . ''
___
HAVE ANY DRUG TRAFFICKERS EVER BEEN SENTENCED TO DEATH ?
The Death Penalty Information Center lists 14 federal death row prisoners awaiting execution for drug-related crimes . They include Azibo Aquart , who was sentenced to death in 2012 for planning and participating in the deaths of a rival and two people living with them There is also Orlando Hall , who was sentenced in 2007 for a drug-related kidnapping that ended in death . Dustin Honken was sentenced to die in 2004 for the killings of two children in a drug-related conspiracy in which three other people were also killed .

WILL MORE FEDERAL DEATH SENTENCES EASE THE DRUG EPIDEMIC ?
Trump believes so , but others are skeptical .
Cornell Law School Professor John H. Blume said enforcement of the Federal Drug Kingpin Act tends to net poor minorities considered low- to mid-level drug dealers rather than kingpins whose products are fueling the drug crisis . Opponents said the approach resembles the drug war of the 1970s and '80s , when there was bipartisan agreement in Washington that the best way to fight crime was with long , mandatory prison sentences . That approach is now questioned by some conservatives as well as liberals .
`` I do n't think there 's any reason to believe that attempting to revive this policy and use it more effectively will be any more successful , '' Blume said , adding that death sentences are hard to win . Too few drug traffickers will be sentenced to death and executed to have a real deterrent effect , they said . `` I do n't think people out there who sell drugs are worried about , am I going to get the death penalty ? ''
New Year 's Eve is n't just a day for hiding drunk under the blankets to emerge for the occasional bit of adult entertainment . There are humans , apparently dozens of 'em , that like to go out and “ do things ” on December 31st . It 's perverse , but we 'll allow it .
Russian billionaire ( expect to hear that term a lot more in 2017 ) and Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich threw a decadent New Year 's Eve bash to close out 2016 and that party included The Killers pairing with a Beatle for a surprise “ Helter Skelter ” duet . The concert took place at Abramovich 's St. Bart 's estate and it seemed like folks were having a nice time .
“ So far , so good , ” note the Las Vegas rock outfit in the caption for the Sir Paul McCartney co-starring clip . At present , the video has already logged over 1.2 million views .
Getting marquee names for their NYE soirees is sort of Abramovich 's end-of-the-year gimmick . In previous years , he 's had Beyoncé , Prince and Red Hot Chili Peppers swing by to perform tunes for their guests . Their ability to pull out dough and get famous folks to spend New Year 's with them seems like something President-elect Donald Trump might ask about when they chat with Vladmir Putin .

NEW YORK ( AP ) — Last season , `` Billions '' performed a delicate balancing act .
Chuck Rhoades , the powerful and perverse U.S. Attorney ( played by Paul Giamatti ) , was locked in a legal cage match with hedge-fund titan Bobby `` Axe '' Axelrod ( Damian Lewis ) . But through it all , Wendy Rhoades kept a foot planted in both worlds : as the wife of Chuck and top aide to Axe .
Now , in this Showtime drama 's sophomore season , the equilibrium is shattered . Wendy has separated from their husband and bolted from Axe 's firm , leaving those combatants to clash even more ferociously .
The only sure thing about the narrative shakeup : Wendy Rhoades can take care of herself , and , when necessary , cut Chuck and Axe down to size . On a show that pits two Alpha Males against each other , Wendy stands tall as a reigning Alpha Woman .
`` This season you see them trying to walk a line with each of them while they maintain their dignity and distance , '' says Maggie Siff , who brings Wendy vibrantly to life . `` To find their own moral center , they had to shed the two of them . ''
On the premiere ( Sunday at 10 p.m. EST ) , you 'll see Wendy spurn Bobby Axelrod 's overtures to return as the in-house psychotherapist and performance coach .
`` There 's this thing that happens when we 're in a room together , '' they say sharply as they work their charm . `` But I 'm shutting it off . I HAVE shut it off . ''
And you 'll see them stand up to Chuck when they rage , `` I always knew I 'd end up smeared by Axelrod 's poison , '' for which they blame their wife as having served as the carrier : `` Proximity is enough . ''
`` I no longer have proximity to it , '' they sneer , `` and YOU no longer have proximity to ME . ''
Wendy is an unusual character for series TV , and a distinctly different character than Siff has played in the past . And yet all their women share a common bond : They 're strong , smart and commanding even in a crowd dominated by men .
For six seasons on FX 's hit drama `` Sons of Anarchy , '' Siff played Tara Knowles , the physician wife of a motorcycle-gang leader who could hold their own , and then some , in that wild-and-woolly world . ( At least , until they were stabbed to death in their kitchen with a barbecue fork by , ironically , another woman : their mother-in-law and the club 's grande dame . )
`` When we first started that series ( in 2008 ) I did n't expect it would become the sensation it did , '' says Siff in their quiet , thoughtful way , `` but it tapped into something tribal in the audience 's psyche . It was so pulpy in its violence , yet also had this operatic family drama at its center even when the violence crossed the line — MY line , at least . There were scenes I could n't watch ! ''
Siff came to `` Sons '' from their brief but emblematic stint early in `` Mad Men , '' where they played Rachel Menken , the bold heiress and boss of a New York department store who became romantically involved with ad man Don Draper .
Unlike so many of their conquests , Rachel soon recognized that their relationship was not one for the ages . They cut their ties with Don , this caddish married man and dad , when they proposed they leave it all behind and run away together .
Years later , Don ( and the audience ) would learn that Rachel had died of leukemia — but not before they made a brief comeback .
Siff was pleased to shoot this fleeting encore for the series ' final season .
`` I always wanted Rachel to circle back through that world , '' they say .
But the one-minute scene they were asked to play ( the only portion of the script they were privy to ) made no sense to her , especially after series star Jon Hamm tipped them off that their character was dead .
`` I said to ( series creator ) Matt ( Weiner ) , 'What 's going on ? ' They said , 'It 's a dream . Just do a dream ! ' ''
They did , with a chinchilla coat obscuring tell-tale evidence that they were pregnant with Lucy , now 2½ , by their husband , design consultant Paul Ratliff .
`` I had no idea how the scene lived inside the episode until I saw it on TV along with everybody else , '' they say .
A woman who began their career in experimental theater in Philadelphia and then off-Broadway , the Bronx , New York native , now 42 , admits to surprise at their repeated success in TV drama .
But surprise has been a driving force in their career , they explain : `` You have to surrender yourself to what finds you in this life . ''
Despite no sign of surrendering , they find themselves now in an acclaimed drama alongside two leading men they call `` phenomenal actors and phenomenal human beings .
`` Damian is so subtle but so precise as an actor , '' they say , `` while Paul charges out of the gate with so much life . Their energies are very different . It 's fun to float between them as scene partners . ''
And for `` Billions '' viewers , there 's more fun ahead watching Siff power between them as the forceful link in this tangled tale .

Prime Minister Netanyahu and their wife Sara visited the Mimouna festivities at the house of Aharon and Ilana Levy of Hadera .
Mimouna is a Moroccan Jewish festival which celebrates belief in both the past Jewish redemption from the Egyptians and the future Messianic redemption : The sages state that `` In Nisan ( the month in which Passover falls ) , the Jews were redeemed and in Nisan they will be redeemed in the future . `` When Passover ends and the Jews are still not redeemed , the Moroccan Jews do not lose their faith . The word Mimouna , corresponding to the Hebrew word Emuna ( faith ) , emphasizes this . ''
The Prime Minister said at the event that `` this beautiful , colorful festival began as a festival of one community and has now become a festival for all the communities . It has a lot of love , welcome to guests , fellowship , warmth and joy . ''
`` There 's a lot to be joyful about , '' added Netanyahu . `` I say this empirically because there are about 200 countries in the world and the people of Israel placed in a very high position in the happiness index , recently maintaining the 11th position on the list [ of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network-2017 ] . That means we have 10 more places to rise . There 's lots to be happy about . Just look around and see the miracle which is the state of Israel . You see this isle of progress , of stability , of security and mutual responsibility . ''
Netanyahu added `` You ought to know that world leaders are paying attention to this . I was recently in China with my wife Sara and the president of China , Xi Jinping , said to me : 'You know , we will soon have 1.4 billion residents . ' and I told them 'we have just passed 8 million . ' They then said 'but you are a world power , a world leader in technology and innovation . ' They are right , but its not just innovation , not just ideology , its also curiosity , activity and initiative . It is ingrained in our psyche . Some African leaders asked me recently at the UN : 'Tell me , what is your secret ? You are such a small country , small nation , yet you are so strong . ' I said that our tree is a special tree . It sends branches up towards heaven in a continuous effort to grow and improve but it has very deep roots , in our land and in our heritage . The Jewish heritage has a combination of many different communities , a combination of faith and curiosity and this is what makes our economy , society and army strong and gives us a growing international standing .
`` I never stop being amazed at the miracle of the rebirth of Israel , a people which was nearly wiped out has gathered its exiles , arrived here , built a wonderful country with soldiers , police officers and women and wives of security personnel who are keeping us going and bringing us to the wonderful future facing us . A happy festival to all , '' concluded the Prime Minister .

This year 's Scripps National Spelling Bee drew the largest number of competitors in its history , 516 . But the field is far smaller , as only 41 spellers advance to the finals Thursday .
The finalists were announced Wednesday after two days of onstage spelling during which nearly 200 spellers were eliminated for getting words wrong . Scores on a written spelling and vocabulary test determined who advanced to the finals .
“ There were no perfect scores on the test , ” spelling bee Executive Director Paige Kimble says , “ We thought it was an easy test . We were wrong . ”
“ They made it hard on purpose ” said Jacob Williamson , a former competitor who is coaching five spellers this year .
But that did n't seem to shake the confidence of those who have traversed the road before .
“ It was fine , actually . I did n't expect it to be fine , ” said Erin Howard , 13 , of Huntsville , Alabama . “ I think at worst I missed five . ”
According to Scripps , 113 of the spellers this year had previous national finals experience and 45 have relatives who are former competitors , including Atman Balakrishnan , from Chicago , whose father Balu Natrajan was the winner in 1985 , and the first Indian-American to take the title .
The top scorers this year are Shruthika Padhy , Aisha Randhawa and Karthik Nemmani .
Shruthika came into the bee as one of the favorites , having finished in seventh place last year .
The past 13 champions and 18 of the last 22 have been Indian-American . [ Read More ]

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — New federal data show that black students continue to be expelled and suspended from school much more frequently than their white peers .
The report released by the Education Department on Tuesday is likely to add to an already tense national debate about what causes such racial disparities . Civil rights groups believe that racial bias is at play and insist that federal protections are necessary . Other experts say that imposing discipline restrictions on schools causes chaos in classrooms .
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is considering scrapping Obama-era rules that were meant to counter those disparities .
Data shows that while black students represented 8 percent of all enrolled students in 2015-2016 , they accounted for 25 percent of suspensions . Black girls made up 8 percent of all students and 14 percent of suspensions .
CLEVELAND ( AP ) — The Cleveland Indians are dropping the Chief Wahoo logo from their uniforms next year after decades of protests and complaints that the grinning , red-faced caricature used in one version or another since 1947 is racist .
The move , announced Monday , came after protracted discussions between team owner Paul Dolan and baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred .
The cartoonish image of a big-toothed American Indian with a scarlet face and a single feather in their headdress will come off the team 's sleeves and caps starting with the 2019 season , when Cleveland will host the All-Star Game .
`` Major League Baseball is committed to building a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout the game , '' Manfred said in a statement . They said the logo `` is no longer appropriate for on-field use . ''
The decision is unlikely to quell complaints from Native American organizations and others who see the symbol — and the team 's very name — as insensitive . The Indians will continue to wear the Wahoo logo in 2018 , and even after it is gone from the uniform , the club will sell merchandise featuring the mascot in the Cleveland area .
`` I 'm elated , '' Philip Yenyo , executive director of the American Indian Movement of Ohio , said of the decision to remove Wahoo from uniforms . `` But at the same time , I think it should be this year . I do n't understand why they 're drawing this out . It does n't make any sense to me , unless they want to continue to make what 's basically blood money . ''
They added : `` Just make the leap already . ''
Yenyo and others have demanded that the team go further and drop `` Indians '' as its name : `` If they do n't get rid of the name , then you 're still going to have fans going down there wearing headdresses and painted in redface . ''
Amid the intensifying debate , the club has slowly moved away from the logo in recent years . The Indians replaced it with a `` C '' as their primary logo and removed signs depicting Chief Wahoo from Progressive Field , the team 's ballpark .
There was no immediate reaction from Indians players .
`` It 's a big disappointment , '' Jeremiah Baker said at a sporting goods store in suburban Westlake as they picked through a clearance bin of caps with their wife and two children . `` Chief Wahoo has been so iconic for so many years , and I understand that some people may be offended , but it 's a blow to native Clevelanders . ''
National criticism and scrutiny over Chief Wahoo grew in 2016 , when the Indians made the World Series and Manfred expressed their desire to have the team drop the symbol . During the playoffs , a lawsuit was filed while the club was playing in Toronto to have the logo and team name banned from Canadian TV . A judge dismissed the case .
The Indians ' bid to host the 2019 All-Star Game heightened the debate .
`` While we recognize many of our fans have a longstanding attachment to Chief Wahoo , I 'm ultimately in agreement with Commissioner Manfred 's desire to remove the logo from our uniforms in 2019 , '' Dolan said in announcing the decision .
The presence of the Wahoo logo is likely to remain strong in the stands on caps , T-shirts and signs , and other Native American references in the stadium will probably persist . For over 40 years , one fan , John Adams , has pounded a tom-tom in the left-field bleachers .
The team will continue to sell Chief Wahoo gear because if it stops doing so , it will lose ownership of the trademark , and others will be able to use the symbol as they please .
Reaction to the announcement was swift on social media as fans took sides on a touchy topic that has become part of the Cleveland sports landscape for generations .
Every year , Native American groups have protested outside the stadium before the home opener in hopes of getting the Indians not only to abolish Chief Wahoo but to change the team name .
Many fans are dedicated to preserving Chief Wahoo and see the logo as a symbol of the city 's resurgence in the mid-1990s , when the Indians opened their new ballpark and the team made the World Series for the first time since 1954 .
The NFL 's Washington Redskins have come under similar pressure to change their less-cartoonish Indian-head logo and their name but so far have resisted . Last year , a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in another case made it clear that the Redskins name can not be stripped of trademark protection just because some find it offensive .
Stanford , Illinois and Dartmouth are among the colleges and universities that have dropped Native American nicknames or symbols for their teams over the years .

Transcript for Trump threatening to sue Stormy Daniels for $ 20 million
So Donald Trump 's lawyer , Michael Cohen , is threatening to sue stormy Daniels for $ 20 million . Why ? For violating the nondisclosure agreement , also known as the nda , and they want to take it to federal court . They are literally making a federal case out of it . You know your mother would say , why are you making a federal case out of it . Does n't this prove that stormy has info that they do n't want out there ? They want to move it to federal court so they can have an arbitration and remember arbitrations are kind of like secret proceedings ? What is it , secret proceedings ? Almost like a secret proceeding , whereas in the federal court it 's open to the public . I pulled this for joy , the actual notice of removal . It says Stephanie Clifford , aka stormy Daniels , versus Donald Trump , aka David Dennison . They filed it . He 's in the middle of it now . I thought they said they had nothing to do with it . Now he 's in the middle of it . That 's so strange . Why did they join the lawsuit and move it to federal court . Does this automatically happen ? Who makes the decision on whether this is a justifiable case ? A federal judge . Now that he 's in the middle of it and this was obviously hush money , does n't that say something about -- What do we want to know because -- is it , like acom 's razor , of course . Is it highly likely they slept with a porn star , 1,000 % ? Them porn hub searches have spiked 375 % following the weeks after the Wall Street journal report . They put out a report to which I was unimpressed . They came on TV and giggled . I want to know going forward if she 's threatened , if they know something about the Mueller investigation , if they know something about our national security , great . But what are we interested in ? We 're interested in the hush money . The campaign finance law . So there 's proof now that the Trump campaign , through the vessel of the Trump campaign paid them off , that 's what we want to know ? Yeah . That 's against the law . I do n't even know what I want to know but because they keep doing things it makes me think there 's something I should know . It 's campaign finance laws . If they paid $ 130,000 to hush them up , you know , right before the election , I think as the American people we should know if that money was used -- It 's like a bullying scheme against a private citizen , $ 1 million per count he 's charging with the nondisclosure . Now I 'm like what is so big in this interview ? Is there something else in there . I 'm fascinated . Stick with Mueller . She 's going on 60 minutes this Sunday . They were supposed to go on last Sunday . Next week , the 25th . It keeps getting moved every Sunday when I 'm going to hear their talk . They 're vetting it . I get it but this is the problem . Even for me right now , I 'm like , enough dancing , enough teasing . You 're on your make America horny again tour , I got it , but I want to know what else you have to say . It 's obnoxious . We 'll find out . Are n't there some legal battles with not allowing it to air ? Yes , of course . That 's the part that 's holding them off . It 's making the tour more profitable . Stormy Daniels was not born like Donald Trump with a multi-million dollar gift from their daddy . Let 's remember -- They need to make a living . First of all , I would never talk about a woman who is making money in a legal -- of course not . That 's not the issue . But we ca n't negate the fact that they have benefitted financially from these accusations . Good for them Whatever , but if that 's the only reason why you 're doing this -- We cared when John Edwards did this . We cared enough to take them to court . We cared then . Why do n't we care about this now ? I have to wrap . In fact , there were many rumors on campaigns that this was going on and it took a `` National enquirer '' journalist to get it out , not a regular political journalist . Well they 're in trump 's pocket . The `` National enquirer '' won a Peabody award . Why are n't they in trump 's pocket . They never say a negative thing about him . Interesting . One more thing about stormy Daniels and then I have to go . They say they were threatened physically . Yes , and I would like to know by whom . We 'll find out . I want to know the details .

At least one person is dead and seven others are injured after a driver drove into patrons at a restaurant in a suburb northeast of Paris , a French Interior Minister spokesperson told ABC News .
The spokesperson said the car intentionally plowed into the terrace of a pizzeria in Sept-Sorts . Five people were badly injured , while two others were only slightly wounded .
A suspect has been arrested , according to the spokesperson . The motive is unknown at this time .
This is a breaking news story . Please check back for updates .

Have you ever wondered what it takes to be the chef of a major league team ? Probably not . It was n't on my radar either until I read a fascinating article about Chef Morgan Bunnell , who orchestrates the daily meals for the L.A. Galaxy soccer team . Since today 's professional athletes no longer carbo load , it 's their job to create healthful yet delicious meals using seasonal ingredients to satisfy a range of dietary needs . To achieve these results Bunnell enjoys using fresh produce harvested from a garden nestled beyond some concession stands through a nondescript gate at the StubHub Center–home of the Galaxy team .
Of special interest is that the employees at StubHub started the garden on their own time and some of the players help them tend to it . Locally grown food is a priority for Bunnell , who planted herbs and vegetables in their backyard before enjoying the benefits of an on-site garden just steps away from their kitchen . From the StubHub garden they source ingredients including fresh honey from eight beehives year-round to feed 90 to 180 players and staff daily .
StubHub is not the only stadium garden . The 49ers ' Levi 's Stadium in Santa Clara has a budding garden , and in 2015 the Boston Red Sox planted Fenway Farms , a 5,000-square-foot rooftop garden on the third-base side of the ballpark above Yawkey Way . About 4,000 pounds of produce are harvested annually , which fans can enjoy while dining at Fenway Park 's EMC Club Restaurant . The stadium 's Strega Deck garden was opened in 2016 to provide food that is donated to the community through the food rescue partner , Lovin ' Spoonfuls .
It 's exciting to see such creativity about where a garden grows . The belief that farms are the only food suppliers has been replaced with an attitude of possibility and potential . In Troy , Michigan , owners of an industrial building transformed the side yard from turf grass to an organic vegetable garden providing a small environmental oasis offsetting the predominately concrete appearance .
The benefits of these gardens are therapeutic as much as they are nutritious . While home gardeners have reaped the rewards for a long time , the onset of community gardens particularly in the work setting is more recent . Giving people the opportunity to tend a garden during work hours eases stress , keeps employees fit and can improve overall mood .
So , if gardening on your own feels overwhelming or you do n't have access to your own plot of land , volunteer at a school or community garden . They seem to be growing everywhere these days .

Sunderland boss Chris Coleman would need no reminder as to the talents of Liverpool forward and January target Ben Woodburn .
But they got one at the weekend . The exciting teenager scored a sensational strike against Sunderland Under-23s at the Stadium of Light , firing past Mika from 25 yards in a comfortable 4-1 win .
Coleman was at the stadium but they will be fully aware of the talented teens potential already .
It was Coleman that gave the teenager their full Wales debut . Aged just 17 , they hammered home a superb winner as Wales beat Austria 1-0 in Cardiff .
It plunged Woodburn into the spotlight .
And Coleman , in need of reinforcements , hopes to be able to attract them to Wearside next month on loan from Liverpool .
Woodburn was one of the standout performers in the Under-23 game . Liverpool 's second string extended their lead at the top of Premier League 2 with victory and Woodburn played a key role .
The Reds played a 4-2-3-1 formation and the teenager was deployed on the left wing of the three men supporting striker Rhian Brewster – another hot prospect .
Woodburn is predominantly right-footed , very comfortable on the ball and was happy to go deep in order to get it .
One mazy run they went on should have resulted in a penalty while they were at the heart of all Liverpool 's good attacking play .
Still only 18 , they are a regular for the Under-23s and has already made their Liverpool and Wales debut .
Quite a prospect . Clearly Sunderland would n't pin all their hopes on the shoulders of a teenager forward but they certainly look a big talent .
The Liverpool No 10 gave Josh Robson a difficult afternoon at right back .
Woodburn 's main position is wide left but they are also comfortable on the right and in a central role .
Woodburn produced a moment of magic 40 minutes in , their quick feet turning the Sunderland defence before dinking a delightful ball to the back post , but Liverpool could n't capitalise .
Quick feet , good balance , keen to get at the defence , Woodburn got their goal eight minutes from time to seal the 4-1 win .
Brewster laid the ball off to the forward and they hit a stunning first-time strike past Mika , Sunderland 's third-choice unable to prevent the well-hit sidefooted effort from nestling in the corner of the goal .
It capped a fine performance .
The watching scouts will have taken a note of their name , with Coleman keen to attract them to Wearside to bolster their attacking options .
Woodburn already has a link with Sunderland , having made their Liverpool debut against the Black Cats in November 2016 .
Three days later they became Liverpool 's youngest-ever goalscorer – at the age of 17 years and 45 days – when they netted against Leeds United .
Coleman will hope their strong links with the forward will help seal a loan move .

MONTREAL ( AP ) — American Morgan Hurd won the all-around title in the world gymnastics championships Friday night , spoiling Ellie Black 's bid to become the first Canadian winner .
The 16-year-old Hurd edged Black by 0.101 points , finishing with 55.232 points in their world championships debut . Russia 's Eremina Elena was third at 54.799 .
`` It 's crazy that I was even competing here , '' said Hurd , from Middletown , Delaware . `` To think that I won is just the most surreal feeling in the world . ''
American Ragan Smith , the favorite to win the gold medal , was forced to withdraw from the final after injuring their ankle during the vault warm up at Olympic Stadium .
Black is a five-time Canadian champion .
`` I 'm standing here with the silver medal , so I 'm pretty happy with that , '' said Black , from Halifax , Nova Scotia . `` There 's ups and downs in gymnastics , there are mistakes that are made . It 's part of the sport . There are probably a bunch of athletes who would love to be in my position right now . I just feel so fortunate to have had this opportunity and to be here tonight . ''
CINCINNATI ( AP ) — A bridge that carries highway traffic across the Ohio River near Cincinnati has been serving tens of thousands more vehicles a day than it was designed to handle .
Time and traffic are wearing on the Brent Spence Bridge , which is frequently cited as a location where major infrastructure upgrades are needed , The Cincinnati Enquirer ( http : //cin.ci/2kSnJnH ) reported .
It is increasingly showing rust and cracks , but maintenance officials maintain that it remains structurally sound .
“ And we are committed to keeping it that way , ” said Bob Yeager , chief engineer for the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet 's District Six , which oversees maintenance of the 53-year old bridge . “ But you 've got two interstates converging and diverging at one end and that creates issues and traffic patterns we just ca n't fix overnight .
The Brent Spence was made to handle 80,000 vehicles in 1963 , and the addition of a fourth lane in 1985 brought that capacity to 120,000 . But the most recent data indicate the bridge had daily traffic of over 185,000 vehicles in 2015 , nearing a record amount .
That has meant more crashes there , too — usually at least two per week .
Accidents reached an all-time high in 2015 , when there were 121 collisions along the span . Crashes on the Brent Spence were up 52 percent between 2010 and 2015 in comparison with the previous six years .
Local transportation officials have yet to identify a long-term solution to correct the bridge 's safety and congestion issues . The newspaper reported that 's due in part to the ongoing dispute on how to pay for such a fix .
An initial proposal to remedy the Brent Spence 's woes estimated that it would cost approximately $ 2 billion to fix the existing bridge and build a new one alongside it .

ILOILO CITY—A woman is fighting for their life after they were shot and wounded when violence erupted between armed men and a group of land reform beneficiaries in a disputed property in Capiz province on Saturday .
Melinda Eslana-Arroyo , 48 , remains unconscious with a bullet lodged in their head at the intensive care unit of Western Visayas Medical Center here .
Doctors have not performed surgery because of the possibility that this will worsen their condition , according to Marianne Tanate , one of the lawyers of land beneficiaries involved in the dispute .

Three others—Ana Bocala , Nida Amo and Adel Vergara—were shot and wounded and taken to Bailan District Hospital in Pontevedra town in Capiz .
A fifth victim , Orlando Eslana , Melinda 's older brother , died when unidentified armed men fired at land reform beneficiaries during a confrontation in Barangay Culilang in President Roxas town .
Jesery Lachica , 47 , a relative of Culilang village chief Ferdinand Bacanto , administrator of the disputed property , was hacked and wounded allegedly by Eslana .
About 60 farmers , who were issued with certificates of land ownership award ( Cloa ) in 1998 covering 198 hectares , occupied a 3-ha area of the property of Nemesio Tan on Feb. 6 . They said they took over the property due to the failure of the Department of Agrarian Reform ( DAR ) to install them as owners even after they were given titles .
Gil Marie Alba , lawyer of land administrator Bacanto , said they were readying charges against the land beneficiaries who were staying in sections of the property owned by the heirs of Tan .
“ Let the law take its course , ”  Alba told the Inquirer .
They said what the land beneficiaries did was “ clearly illegal , ” citing an injunction issued by the Capiz Regional Trial Court in 2000 barring the DAR from installing the beneficiaries .
Senior Insp . Rachel Garnica , President Roxas police chief , said the local police were readying complaints against three persons identified by survivors as the ones who shot them .
Alba and the land beneficiaries lamented the police 's supposed failure to prevent the violence and arrest those involved .
PO3 Rez Bermudez said police officers were spread out in the area because they responded to two confrontations shortly before the shooting happened . Only nine police officers were assigned there during the incident .
“ Our priority was to break up the confrontation and bring the wounded to the hospital , ” they said .
At least 15 shots were fired , as shown by a video footage taken by one of the wounded , Nida Amo .
The low-resolution footage from a camera phone , running for two minutes and 50 seconds , showed people running toward a tractor where a confrontation was taking place . Shortly after , shouts were heard and then successive gunshots . —NESTOR P. BURGOS JR .

Atlanta Braves catcher Kurt Suzuki ( 24 ) runs to first base after hitting a single during the seventh inning of a baseball game against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park , Wednesday , June 14 , 2017 , in Washington . The Braves won 13-2 . ( AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster )
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- The Atlanta Braves had dropped three straight before this week 's series against the Washington Nationals .
That only makes their rare series victory against the defending NL East champs even sweeter .
Julio Teheran earned their third consecutive victory , Kurt Suzuki homered and Atlanta defeated Washington 13-2 on Wednesday to take two of three from the Nationals .
'' It 's a tough place to win , '' manager Brian Snitker said . '' It 's a very good team and we were coming off a rough series at home . Guys responded well . We started swinging the bats and the bullpen did a great job . It was a good series for us . ''
Brandon Phillips had four hits and three RBIs for the Braves , who had dropped seven consecutive road series against the Nationals and had lost 23 of their last 25 games in Washington before this series . It was Atlanta 's first series victory at Washington since taking two during a three-game set April 4-6 , 2014 .
Teheran ( 6-4 ) matched a season-high with seven innings , allowing six hits and one walk while striking out three against a lineup that did not include resting regulars Anthony Rendon and Matt Wieters .
'' Even if I give up a homer or something , I just have to stay focused and execute pitches , '' Teheran said . '' That 's something I was doing really good - getting ahead in counts and throwing strike one . It was big today . ''
Washington lost its second consecutive series and finished 2-5 on its homestand .
'' It was a tough homestand , '' Washington manager Dusty Baker said . '' This is not the kind of homestand you want to exhibit in front of your home fans . ''
Atlanta was in control from the start against Washington starter Tanner Roark ( 6-4 ) , who gave up two runs before they recorded an out and three total in the first inning .
The Braves would add three more in the third , with Nick Markakis scoring from third after Nationals catcher Jose Lobaton 's pickoff attempt of Matt Kemp caught first baseman Ryan Zimmerman off guard and sailed into right field . Kemp was thrown out at third and left the game the following half-inning as a precaution after experiencing hamstring tightness .
After a walk to Matt Adams , Suzuki hit their fourth home run of the season to make it 6-2 .
Teheran yielded a two-run homer to Brian Goodwin in the second inning , but otherwise encountered little difficulty . They did not allow a runner past second base after Goodwin 's home run .
'' Julio pitched a really good game , '' Kemp said . '' He made one mistake but other than that they were money . ''
Roark surrendered nine hits while matching a season-high with seven runs allowed over five innings .
SUZUKI 'S BREAKOUT
Suzuki 's home run snapped an 0-for-19 slump . The catcher added a single in the seventh , securing their first multi-hit game since May 23 .
ALL IN THE FAMILY
The Nationals selected OF Darren Baker , the son of manager Dusty Baker , in the 27th round of the baseball draft . Darren Baker already holds a place in baseball lore ; as a 3-year-old bat boy during the 2002 World Series , they were swooped up by San Francisco 1B J.T . Snow to avoid injury at home plate .
TRAINER 'S ROOM
Braves : The team announced INF Adonis Garcia underwent surgery Monday to repair ligament damage in their left ring finger . Garcia , who is hitting .247 with four homers and 16 RBIs , went on the DL June 7 and is expected to miss about two months .
Nationals : OF Chris Heisey , on the DL since May 24 with a ruptured right biceps , will not join the team on its trip to New York and Miami . '' He 's not close , I do n't think , '' Baker said . '' He 's not as close as they thought they were a couple weeks ago . That injury is a lot more serious than they and we thought it was . ''
UP NEXT
Braves : Rookie LHP Sean Newcomb ( 0-1 , 0.00 ) makes their second start as Atlanta opens a weekend series with Miami at home Friday .
Nationals : LHP Gio Gonzalez ( 5-1 , 2.91 ) seeks their third win in their last four starts as Washington begins a four-game series against the Mets .

Jonjo Shelvey has admitted they are seeing a psychologist in a bid to curb the anger which is threatening to blight their career .
The 25-year-old Newcastle midfielder , who served a five-match ban last season for allegedly racially abusing Wolves counterpart Romain Saiss , was sent off on their return to the Premier League on Sunday after stamping on Tottenham 's Dele Alli .
Shelvey , who was also dismissed at Nottingham Forest last season for kicking out at Henri Lansbury only to have the red card rescinded later , apologised to their team-mates after the game as television pundits and fans queued up to condemn their behaviour .
Speaking in an interview conducted on Friday , but not published until Monday , they told the Daily Mail : “ Look , sometimes I just need to rein it in on the football pitch . I need to just shut up and stuff . I need to not get involved and walk away .
“ I started to see a psychologist last year to work on the mental side of things . It was after the Forest game . I was sent off . I had kicked out at this lad and it was just childish .
“ When people wind me up , I should just laugh . I do need to get that out of me . Sometimes you ca n't help it .
“ I started to work with this fella and after that , there was n't really an incident when I did that . I started to learn to keep my head down and just get on with the game . But it 's an ongoing process and I am still working with him .
“ Sometimes I can lose my head and it ca n't keep happening . ”
However , Shelvey did just that four minutes into the second half of Sunday 's game and referee Andre Marriner sent them off , in the process ending any chance of a positive result for the promoted side .
Goals from Alli and Ben Davies eventually secured victory for Spurs to leave manager Rafael Benitez bemoaning their captain 's indiscipline .

A multistate manhunt for the suspect in a random killing that Cleveland police say they recorded and posted to Facebook is entering its third day .
Authorities say it 's now a nationwide search for 37-year-old Steve Stephens , who 's wanted on an aggravated murder charge in the shooting death of a 74-year-old retired man in Cleveland on Sunday .
Videos Stephens shared show them talking about their despair over gambling debts and trouble with their girlfriend .
On Monday evening , Facebook announced that it was launching a review for reporting harmful content following the killing .

Facebook says , `` we know we need to do better . ''
LONDON ( AP ) — Ireland 's health minister says abortion is a reality for Irish women regardless of whether the country repeals a constitutional ban on most terminations .
Simon Harris told RTE television Tuesday they ca n't ignore the fact that more than 3,200 citizens traveled from Ireland to Britain in 2016 to have abortions they could n't get at home .
They say they are working on proposed new legislation and will update the public next month .
The government has announced plans to hold a public referendum in late May on whether to repeal the eighth amendment to Ireland 's constitution . Voters will be asked if they want to keep the anti-abortion amendment or repeal it so parliament can enact new legislation .
Ireland , a predominantly Roman Catholic country , has the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe .

Security , Middle East
A staff member removes the Iranian flag from the stage after a group picture with foreign ministers and representatives of Unites States , Iran , China , Russia , Britain , Germany , France and the European Union during the Iran nuclear talks at the Vienna International Center in Vienna , Austria July 14 , 2015 . Iran and six major world powers reached a nuclear deal on Tuesday , capping more than a decade of on-off negotiations with an agreement that could potentially transform the Middle East , and which Israel call More
With important issues facing our country , the last thing the country needs is for the president to upend an agreement that is meeting U.S. security objectives .
Why Trump Needs the Iran Deal
Diplomacy is supposed to be the vehicle by which U.S. leaders and officials secure American security and economic interests abroad . Trump 's threat to decertify the Iran nuclear deal , whatever flaws may legitimately exist , threatens to cause severe damage to America 's interests in the medium and long term .
The intent to scuttle this agreement continues a troubling and serious erosion of U.S. diplomacy . In isolation , decertifying the deal with Iran is unequivocally counter to U.S. interests . It will not only remove existing constraints on the regime 's ability to develop nuclear weapons , but will harden Iranian resolve against any future bargain with the United States—and possibly more damaging—it could make allies and partners across the globe conclude that the United States is no longer a trustworthy international leader , harming America 's ability to conclude future agreements that may be necessary to advance U.S. economic interests .
One need not be an apologist for the Iranian dictatorship to advocate adherence to the existing plan . We should soberly acknowledge the human-rights abuses Iran 's leaders commit against their own people , the regime 's support of terrorism and the threat their developing ballistic-missile program may pose . But it is critical that Trump avoid the propensity to believe that U.S. policy in a complex international environment can be set merely by selecting U.S. preferences .
In a perfect world , it would be America 's preference to see Iran cease its ballistic-missile program , entirely shelve its nuclear enrichment capability and end all support to international terror organizations . But we do n't live in a perfect world . We have to find the best confluence of influencing our adversaries and cooperating with our friends , while not worsening our current position . Ending the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ) with Iran would unequivocally , materially worsen both our near-term and long-term interests across the globe .
If the president decertifies and Congress later junks the JCPOA , the meaningful controls currently constraining the Iranian regime 's ability to develop a nuclear-weapons capability will be removed . Iran will then have every motivation to begin the program that U.S. intelligence confirms it scrapped in 2003 . Many neocons in the Trump administration would likely then begin threatening military strikes again—which would push the mullahs all the more rapidly into a crash course to develop a nuclear deterrent as quickly as possible .
This would unequivocally be antithetical to U.S. and Israeli security interests . Going to war with Iran before it reaches this threshold would turn the current inferno of the Middle East into a veritable smelting furnace that would likely consume U.S. interests beyond recognition . After a meeting on Thursday that included discussion of the situation in Iran , President Trump told reporters , “ Maybe it 's the calm before the storm . ”
It is a dangerous misapprehension of the considerable risks the United States would incur if the president believes U.S. armed forces could destroy Iran or its regime in a cost-effective way . Iran is nearly double the size of Iraq , and the violence and terrorism it could unleash in retaliation should America attack would be orders of magnitude worse than anything we 've suffered since 2001 .
Moreover , junking the JCPOA would harm our interests with friends and allies , likely diminishing our ability to secure future trade and security deals beneficial to our country . If allies such as France , Germany , or Japan believe that America will agree to a deal today , only to disregard it when a new administration enters office or we simply change our minds later , they will be far , far less likely to bind their national interests to ours . If our friends ca n't trust our word , our adversaries can trust us even less—which poses a far greater danger than appears .
The most obvious example is North Korea . We claim to be seeking a diplomatic solution with dictator Kim Jong-un , trying to coerce them into giving up the only independent means they have to defend themselves against U.S. attack . Were Kim to see the United States simply disregard its agreement with Iran after years of painstaking negotiations , they will logically conclude that it would be suicidal to give up their nuclear weapons , and thus they will hold on to—and continue developing—his program at all costs . Such an outcome is clearly counter to U.S. interests .
Yet the most important potential harm could come in future discussions or negotiations with China and Russia . America currently desires discussions and negotiations with Russia regarding sovereignty of Crimea and Ukraine . It is in American interests to ensure borders are not changed by force , and that any that were return to their rightful sovereignty .
If Washington hopes to have the slightest influence on the actions of Moscow or Beijing , or desires each to make meaningful concessions , those parties have to believe the United States will abide by whatever agreement is reached . If either believes they ca n't trust us to abide by our word , the chances of reaching meaningful agreement is virtually nil .
With important issues facing our country—subjects that affect every American today , such as health-care restructuring , tax reform and thorny questions over gun control—the last thing the country needs is for the president to upend an agreement that is in place and certifiably meeting U.S. security objectives . There are alternative methods to address genuine concerns with Iranian behavior , but gutting our diplomatic credibility will only harm our interests .

The new J.J. Abrams Demimonde sci-fi series wo n't be coming to Apple Music because HBO won out in the bidding war . Apple had been hoping to include the series in its stable of upcoming original TV shows , but lost out on adding that feather to its cap .
Hollywood Reporter says Abrams was impressed with HBO 's handling of Westworld , and that may have been what swayed Abrams to sign a deal with the network . Apparently Apple landing Demimonde was always a long shot , despite its nearly unlimited cash supply .
Insider sources say Abrams ' already established relationship with HBO put the network at an advantage . If so , that may be a sign Abram 's was n't willing to take a risk on Apple 's still unproven track record in television .
So far , Apple has only two original shows on Apple TV and neither was received well . Planet of the Apps was a dud with viewers and critics , and Carpool Karaoke did n't fare much better .
Since then , Apple hired former Sony Pictures Television executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to run Apple Music 's original series business . Deals for a reboot of Steven Spielberg 's Amazing Stories is in place , along with the Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston co-produced drama series , Ronald D. Moore 's sci-fi drama , and Are You Sleeping starring Octavia Spencer .
Apple will no doubt continue to pursue other big name shows to bring to Apple TV , but for now J.J. Abrams wo n't be on its roster .
Some 25,000 Christians have returned to eastern Aleppo , Russia 's ambassador in Geneva told a conference organized by their country to highlight the devastated Syrian city 's steps toward returning to normal six months after rebel fighters were ousted by Russian-backed troops . The international Red Cross went even further , estimating that some 80,000 people total have returned .
The Russian conference , `` Aleppo : A city free from terror . New life , new hopes , '' took place Wednesday on the sidelines of the U.N. Human Rights Council just as the International Committee for the Red Cross across the street released a new report with a decidedly different theme : `` I saw my city die '' — referring to Aleppo as well as Iraq 's Mosul and Taiz in Yemen .
The Russian event , where panelists variously decried propaganda , fake news and the alleged slant of `` mainstream media '' in the West about Syria , exemplified a painstaking Russian effort to generate another narrative about the country 's war that has left at least 400,000 people dead and driven over 12 million people from their homes . The ICRC event more broadly pointed to how urban areas have increasingly become the locus of deadly wars and fighting in the world 's most intractable recent conflicts .
The Syrian government of President Bashar Assad , which counts Russia as perhaps its biggest military and diplomatic backer , stands accused by the United Nations and human rights organizations and witnesses of systematically bombing hospitals in eastern Aleppo during its massive bombing campaign , killing dozens of medics over the years .
At its presentation , Russia highlighted the medical relief that its own military teams have been helping provide on the ground in Aleppo .
Ambassador Alexey Borodavkin cited the return figures from local Christian leaders , but did n't specify where they had come from or why other religious groups went unmentioned . Syria 's ambassador in Geneva , Hussam Aala , insisted `` many more '' than that had returned to eastern Aleppo from other parts of Syria , but they did not elaborate .
Ingy Sedky , spokesperson for ICRC Syria , said their organization estimated some 80,000 had returned — many of whom had fled to the western side of the city that has long been in government control .
The Russian event aimed , in their view , to set the record straight about Aleppo and appeal for greater support from Western nations . Speakers said the West had once been very vocal about helping the people of Aleppo but have grown quieter since Syrian troops backed by Russian and Iranian forces recaptured all of Aleppo .
`` In fact , this event is very important because it is coming at a time where those who were making noise only a few months ago about the situation in Aleppo and the suffering of people in Aleppo are totally ignoring now - deliberately ignoring - the needs of the people of Aleppo , '' Aala said from the audience , praising Russia 's role .
Borodavkin insisted that the `` terrorists '' — such as al-Qaida 's Syria affi'aliate and its allies — were the ones who destroyed homes , businesses and hospitals in Aleppo : `` It was not the Russian and Syrian air force who did that . ''
Russian air power was instrumental in helping President Bashar Assad 's forces to regain the city .
The ambassador refused to answer on the record when asked about allegations by some diplomats and others that the Russian presentation in Geneva smacked of propaganda itself .
During the two-hour presentation on U.N. premises , Russian organizers arranged a video uplink with several people in eastern Aleppo — set before its rubble-strewn Old City — including the regional governor and Omran Daqneesh , a young boy who became an emblem of violence in Aleppo last year , and their father .
The presentation included images of Russian medics helping the injured and video shot by unmanned aircraft of the evacuation of eastern Aleppo under an internationally-brokered accord late last year .
As the boy waved to the camera , Russian diplomat and conference mediator Maria Khodynskaya quipped : `` Yes , Omran was a little bit bored but , anyway , he 's too small to understand what propaganda is . ''

ZAMBOANGA CITY— “ Papa , Papa ” was all 11-month-old Peter John , or PJ , could say as they tapped the glass panel of the coffin in a chapel at Barangay Canelar here .
Inside the coffin was their father , Sgt . Jobert Cofino , 28 , one of the 13 soldiers killed in the fighting with Islamic State-inspired terrorists in Marawi City on June 9 .
“ PJ learned to say ‘ Papa ' because my husband , when they were still alive , made regular calls , and most of the time video calls , for PJ , ” said Pronielyn , Cofino 's common-law wife .
ADVERTISEMENT
Pronielyn said PJ might have mistaken the glass panel for a wide mobile phone screen , seeing their father there .
A day before they died , Cofino called Pronielyn and spoke to their son .
They also called their mother , Aida , at noon of June 8 . “ He told me to take care of their son and Pronielyn no matter what happens . I promised them that I will . They said they missed their family so much , ” Aida said .
Pronielyn said when they and their husband last talked by phone on Thursday , Cofino said “ they were extremely exhausted from running . ”
“ He said they kept on running and taking cover . There were snipers everywhere , ” they said .
Both Pronielyn and Aida said it was the first time Cofino had shared what was happening while they were fighting in Marawi .
Cofino was used to the rigors of military life . They were the family 's breadwinner . Their father , an amputee , could hardly support a family of five . When Cofino finished high school , they worked at odd jobs until they joined the Philippine Marines nine years ago .
“ It was really my son 's dream to become a Marine . Everyone here in the community knows their dreams . They were young then when they got the opportunity , ” said Cofino 's father , Ricardo .
ADVERTISEMENT
Cofino was supposed to return to work after their Christmas break but they asked for a weeklong extension so they could help rebuild the family house , which was destroyed in a fire in December . They were on marksmanship training in Tarlac province when their company was called to report to Marawi .
Another fallen Marine
On Friday night , Pronielyn and Aida received reports that the 37th Marine Company suffered casualties . They prayed hard that Cofino was not among the casualties . They received the confirmation through a phone call from the Philippine Marines .
“ At first I thought it was a sick joke . We were in denial , ” Pronielyn said .
On Tuesday , another Marine killed in an ambush in Marawi on Friday , Cpl . John Romulo Caresosa , was taken home to San Miguel , Bohol province , and was given full military honors
Caresosa was given a posthumous military merit award for their gallantry in action . The medal with a bronze spearhead was traditionally pinned on the left chest of the awardee . In the case of Caresosa , their medal was placed on the left side of the glass on their coffin .
Sniper 's bullet
The remote town of Barlig in Mountain Province will be welcoming home its first son to join the Marines , another casualty of the Maute group attack on the Marines on Friday .
On Sunday , Pfc . Gener Tinangag , 23 , will be buried near the family house in Barangay Lunas in Barlig .
After pulling to safety two of their companions , Tinangag was killed by a sniper 's bullet , according to their family .
“ It is hard to accept that they are dead , ” Tinangag 's mother , Marcia , said at a funeral home in Baguio where the Marine 's body would lie for a night before the eight-hour trip to Barlig .
A criminology graduate , Tinangag was the only boy among five siblings . Their two older sisters were also criminology graduates while the youngest sister is studying forensic science .
Tinangag was set to marry their fiancée , Jasmine Escobido , and witness the baptism of their 2-year-old son , Clark Mayner , next year . —WITH REPORTS FROM KARLSTON LAPNITEN AND LEO UDTOHAN

Kirui finished in two hours nine minutes and 37 seconds after holding off a challenge by American Galen Rupp in the race 's final stretch down Boylston Street , the site of the deadly 2013 bombing attack .
Kirui repeatedly tested Rupp in the closing miles , with the American Olympic bronze medalist eventually unable to match the Kenyan 's pace .
`` He put in several surges and I was able to cover a few of them , '' Rupp told reporters after the race .
Kiplagat , a 38-year-old mother of two whose resume includes marathon wins in London , Moscow , New York and Daegu , ran alone for the final miles of the race and finished in 2:21:52 , almost a minute ahead of Bahrain 's Rose Chelimo .
The Kenyan maintained their comfortable lead despite briefly stopping in the final miles when they realized they had grabbed a rival 's water bottle from an aid station and went back to return it .
`` I had to put back something which was not mine , '' Kiplagat told reporters . `` I was afraid , because you know , if you miss water it can affect you . ''
American Jordan Hasay set a record for an American women 's debut marathon , coming in third in 2:23:00 . Japan 's Suguru Osako finished third among the men .
Security was high along the course , which begins in Hopkinton , Massachusetts , and passes through Boston 's suburbs to the finish line , where a pair of ethnic Chechen brothers on April 15 , 2013 set off two homemade bombs , killing three people and injuring more than 200 .
Meb Keflezighi , who in 2014 became the first American to win the race in over three decades , finished 13th in their final Boston Marathon .
Keflezighi , who plans to retire from racing after the New York City marathon in November , stopped after their victory to touch the hand of Bill Richard , whose 8-year-old son Martin was the youngest person to die in the bombing .
`` In 2013 , I was a spectator just like the three victims and when I saw the 8-year-old ... the first thing in my mind was that could have been my daughter , '' said Keflezighi .
Tens of thousands of people packed the streets for Boston 's largest sporting event , held on the Patriots Day holiday , which commemorates the start of the American Revolution .

Santa Ana-based Banc of California 's interim chief financial officer has resigned , the company announced Wednesday .
J. Francisco A. Turner served as the company 's interim CFO and chief strategy officer .
The company 's chief accounting officer Albert J. Wang will become the bank 's principal financial officer . The bank will look for a permanent CFO .
“ The Board and I are encouraged by the progress we have made in our previously announced search to recruit a permanent CFO , and look forward to the completion of that process , ” President and Chief Executive Officer Douglas H. Bowers said in a statement . “ We are committed to building the strongest possible management team fully aligned in our vision for the bank and its future success . ”
Turner will “ pursue financial technology , venture investing and other interests , ” according to Banc of California .
It 's been a tumultuous year for the bank , which has assets of roughly $ 11 billion .
On Jan. 12 , the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a probe of the bank . Chief Executive Steven Sugarman resigned shortly after .
Then in February , the bank sold its home loan division and its mortgage servicing rights to Texas-based Caliber Home Loans cutting its employee count by half .
In March , Banc of California agreed to expand the size of its board after reaching a deal with Legion Partners Asset Management to avoid a proxy battle .
In April Mary Curran and Bonnie Hill were appointed the bank 's board , while Eric Holoman resigned .
Curran previously was chief risk officer for MUFG Union Bank . They are the chair of San Diego State University 's Campanile Foundation . Hill is the president of consulting firm B. Hill Enterprises .
At the time Holoman said they left the board to focus on their new role as chief executive officer of EquiTrust Life Insurance Co .
Common sense suggests that when you 've got a big goal , like committing to a new workout routine , eating better , losing weight , or perhaps writing a book or starting a business , you should tell as many people as possible .
After all , if lots of friends know about your goal , you 'll be motivated to work harder because you do n't want to disappoint yourself or your community .
Plus , your friends will check in with you , and push you , and hold you accountable so that you do n't quit on yourself . Right ?
Well ... maybe not .
In their 3-minute TED Talk , Derek Sivers shares a surprising idea : Telling people about your goal makes it less likely to happen .
Why is this ?
As Derek explains , some researchers think it has something to do with the power of `` social acknowledgment . ''
For example , let 's say you announce to your best friend : `` I 'm going to train for 5K race ! This year , I 'm really doing it ! ''
Your friend responds by saying : `` Congratulations ! What a great goal . You can do it . I 'm so proud of you . ''
As you listen to your friend 's encouragement , praise and acknowledgment , you feel really great ! You feel accepted , appreciated and full of warm , fuzzy feelings .
But there 's a catch : once your body is flooded with those types of warm feelings , you 're actually less motivated to `` do the hard work '' that 's necessary to reach your goal .
In a sense , your brain has been `` tricked '' into thinking you 're already `` done . '' That 's why telling people about your goals can be counter-productive . It gives you a `` premature sense of completeness . '' Or so the theory goes .
My personal opinion : It really depends on your personality and on the type of goal you 're trying to achieve .
If your goal is to get a new job , for example , then it 's important to tell lots of people , because the people in your professional network can point you towards possible job opportunities , write letters of recommendation and open all kinds of doors for you . You 'll get farther and faster if you involve your community .
But in other instances , zipping your lips might be a good idea .
If you 've been telling your friends , `` I 'm going to write a book ! '' for 10 years in a row , but you 're making zero progress , then maybe you could try changing your approach . Zip your lips and start writing in secret . Maybe you 'll find more success if you take the no-talking , action-only approach .
My personal goal was to crank out several more articles and get them polished and queued up for publication so that I do n't have to worry about writing over the winter holiday break .
But instead , I got sidelined by a winter virus .
So , maybe I should n't have said that .

U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it is ready to block U.S. imports of seafood — as well as any other goods — produced by North Korean laborers who work in China .
An Associated Press investigation tracked salmon , squid and cod processed by North Koreans working at Chinese factories and shipped to American stores , including Walmart and ALDI . The North Korean workers found in Chinese factories are n't allowed to leave , and receive only a fraction of their pay — most goes straight to the North Korean state . This means that American consumers buying seafood labeled `` Caught in the USA , Processed in China '' may inadvertently be subsidizing the government of Kim Jong-un as it builds nuclear weapons , and also supporting forced labor .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement Thursday it is reviewing the allegations and if warranted , would `` pursue all enforcement actions and prohibit goods from importation as appropriate . '' The companies that responded also vowed to investigate ties with suppliers .
GOP Congressman Chris Smith from New Jersey , who has repeatedly called for tougher enforcement , said the Labor Department has already identified trafficking in 12 sectors of goods exported by China .
`` CBP should be stopping every shipment from those sectors — and now trafficking-tainted salmon too , '' they said .
A White House National Security Council spokesperson said the North Korean government 's scheme to outsource its labor underscores why the United States has pushed for restrictions on North Korean foreign workers . The spokesperson said all countries should , at a minimum , ban companies from bringing in North Korean crews , as pledged in recent United Nations sanctions .
China is among the countries that have promised to comply , already banning imports of North Korean seafood , and saying no more North Korean workers will be allowed starting next year .
`` But all nations must go further and reject what is clearly a despicable practice that only serves the regime 's nuclear ambitions , '' said the NSC spokesperson , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are n't authorized to comment .
Walmart said its supplier has addressed the problem , although it did not specify how . Walmart and ALDI said they are committed to human rights and fair labor practices , and expect the same from their business partners .
At a time when North Korea faces sanctions on many exports , the government is sending tens of thousands of workers worldwide , bringing in revenue estimated at anywhere from $ 200 million to $ 500 million a year . That could account for a sizable portion of North Korea 's nuclear weapons and missile programs , which South Korea says have cost more than $ 1 billion .
North Koreans overseas work in construction in the Gulf states , shipbuilding in Poland , logging in Russia . In Uruguay , authorities told AP , about 90 North Koreans crewed fishing boats last year .
`` I am not surprised at all , '' said Anthony Talbott , who directs the University of Dayton 's Human Rights Center . `` North Korea has probably the single highest level of state-sanctioned slavery in the world , it 's a major source of income for them . ''
Among those North Korean laborers in China , roughly 3,000 are believed to work in the northeast industrial hub of Hunchun , just a few miles from the borders of both North Korea and Russia . AP documented North Koreans in several Hunchun seafood processing plants , and tracked their supply chains to importers , including Sea-Trek Enterprises in Rhode Island , where managers said they are being inundated with phone calls from customers and suppliers since the AP story .
Sea-Trek 's owners said that they had n't visited China and were unaware of the makeup of the workers , but would immediately cease dealings with the plant until the situation is resolved .
`` Sea-Trek will not purchase product from any company using forced labor , '' said vice president Mitch Sarnoff .
Mark Liszt , owner of Lawrence Wholesale , a national food distributor in Southern California , said it would investigate its suppliers as well .
`` We 're middlemen , '' said Liszt . `` We do make a practice of trying to go and visit the plants that we buy from in person , but it 's not a perfect world that we can see into every single one . ''
Some U.S. brands and companies had indirect ties to the North Korean laborers in Hunchun , including Chicken of the Sea , owned by Thai Union . Trade records show shipments came from a sister company of the Hunchun factory in another part of China , where Thai Union spokesperson Whitney Small says labor standards are being met and the employees are all Chinese . Small said the sister company should not be penalized .
AP observed North Korean workers in Chinese factories building hardwood flooring , sewing garments and manufacturing electronics . Fordham University economics professor Giacomo Santangelo said they doubt it 's just fish processed by North Korean workers that reaches the U.S. markets .
`` Now we need to ask , how many other products imported from China are made with North Korean labor ? '' they said .
Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York said U.S. officials must keep products made by North Koreans out of the United States .
`` The administration needs to ramp up the pressure on China to crack down on trade with North Korea across the board , '' they said .
Ohio 's Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown , who helped pass North Korea , Iran and Russia sanctions this summer , said corporations also have a responsibility to make sure they are abiding by U.N. sanctions and U.S. laws .
However , Bucknell University political science professor Zhiqun Zhu said a sanction-based approach that cracks down on imports is n't going to solve the problem .
`` It has so many loopholes , '' they said . `` All sticks and no carrots will not make the North Korea problem disappear . ''

The always-on hyper-connected world we live in brings with it huge potential , some of it good and some of it bad
The always-on hyper-connected world we live in brings with it huge potential , some of it good and some of it bad . The age of hyper-connectivity has enabled the Internet of Things ( IoT ) to succeed , which promises more personalised and automated services , optimised resource utilisation and added convenience , but have we ignored the risks and merely focused on the hype ?
The number of connected devices has grown at an unprecedented rate with current estimates at between 6-12 billion devices . This number seems enormous but if you doubt it , I suggest you login into your home router and look at how many devices are registered – you may be surprised when you see your TVs , amplifiers and heating thermostats featuring on the list .
We already have cars that can drive themselves and buildings that can configure their environmental control systems based on your presence . The amount of machine-to-machine communication going on around us is growing all the time , but in many cases , we have n't considered ‘ security ' to be part of our buying or implementation processes .
IoT devices , by their very nature , must be easy to deploy and use , but we should not forget that these devices are just small computers . How many of us would plug a computer straight into the Internet using the ( old ) original , un-patched version of an OS , with no firewall or security devices to protect it , using the default username and password ? Not many , but this is what is happening in many cases with IoT devices .
Emerging threats
2016 brought the darker side of the connected world more sharply into focus , with the proliferation of botnets , and weaponised DDoS services , based on IoT devices . If we think back to the early noughties DDoS attacks were often generated by large botnets of compromised end-user 's workstations , because of multiple vulnerabilities and a lack of security awareness .
Cyber-criminals have realised that IoT devices offer a significant capability , just waiting to be exploited in a similar way , and we all saw how thousands of relatively small , innocuous CCTV cameras and DVRs could be leveraged to generate Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS ) attacks at 500Gbps or greater , affecting the availability of Internet services from many well-known Internet brands .
Many IoT devices have good connectivity on unmonitored network segments , and enough processing capability to drive a significant volume of DDoS attack traffic . Attacks from these devices are responsible for some of the increased scale and frequency of DDoS activity reported in Arbor Networks ' annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report ( WISR ) . And , DDoS is just one use-case for compromised IoT devices – more on that later… .
The layered defence strategy
Compromised IoT devices offer attackers a new way to threaten the availability of the Internet services we use , but the best way to protect our businesses has stayed the same . Most businesses today are reliant on the data and application services they utilise via the Internet , and availability issues can be very costly . To combat today 's DDoS threat , businesses and governments alike need to implement a multilayer DDoS protection strategy .
Multi-layered defences incorporate both an on-premise and cloud or ISP-based component . The on-premise component allows businesses to detect and mitigate attacks immediately , before there is any service impact . However , the on-premise solution ca n't deal with increasingly common , large attacks that can saturate Internet connectivity , and this is where the cloud or ISP-based service steps in – to deal with the higher magnitude attacks . The good news is that many more enterprises are adopting layered defence . Arbor 's WISR showed that 30 % of enterprise organisations had adopted this model in 2016 , up from 23 % in 2015 . &
Putting the right defences in place does require investment , and there are many competing priorities in businesses for both IT and security budget . But given the dependence most businesses now have on connectivity for interaction with customers , partners and suppliers , these kinds of defences are essential . Incorporating availability threats into business and IT risk assessment processes can help to quantify the potential impact of a DDoS attack , helping to prioritise investment , and the WISR report shows that around two-thirds of enterprises have now taken this step .
The tip of the iceberg
The combination of DDoS and IoT devices will undoubtedly continue to make the news headlines in the latter part of 2017 , as we see even larger attacks causing problems for both service providers and enterprises . However , DDoS is only one of the ways in which IoT devices can be exploited . We are already seeing compromised IoT devices being used as proxies to obfuscate the original source of traffic . And , if you are thinking that the risk to IoT is limited to those devices that are exposed to the Internet – think again .
Windows malware that looks to scan local networks for IoT devices to infect is already a reality . This would allow attackers to gain a foothold within a network , using our IoT devices , so that they could then move on to target other resources inside or outside of our networks .
The hyperconnected world provides us with some amazing opportunities , mostly positive , but some negative , such as the use of IoT devices to amplify existing threats and create new ones . One thing we can all do is try to avoid becoming a part of the problem , and the solution here is simply to implement good IT security hygiene when we deploy IoT devices .
Improving the security of IoT devices and preventing their compromise are key goals of the security industry and the manufacturers of these devices , but until that is done , and it may take some time , everyone needs to protect themselves from the threats we know that are out there , and DDoS is a significant and growing threat .

The calm before the storm . Daryl Murphy scored twice to help Ireland to an ultimately easy 2-0 win over Moldova , and set up a momentous ‘ play-off for the play-offs ' against Wales in Cardiff on Monday .
This result put Ireland within a point of the Welsh , who lie in second , but those stats are almost immaterial since the bottom line is that both sides need to win to ensure they are not bottom of the nine European runners-up , since only eight goes through to the eliminators .
There is also the opportunity of topping the group , after first-placed Serbia slipped up with a 3-2 defeat away to Austria .
Before we get to all the complications of Monday , this much more simplistic night at least saw Martin O'Neill justify their somewhat-debated new contract by taking Ireland right to the last match of the campaign .
That is not to be dismissed given that Ireland were without so many first-team players in the suspended Robbie Brady and James McClean and injured Seamus Coleman and Jon Walters .
Throughout this campaign , as well as much of the last decade , Ireland have had a tendency to make hard work of matches against notionally easy opponents and it did seem set up for a long night after it was confirmed that Wales had made short work of Georgia . A depleted Ireland were instead very quickly in the lead , because they quickly realised how susceptible Moldova were to set-pieces . After just two minutes , Stephen Ward took a long throw-in from the left , it took a deflection , and Murphy was in to steer it past Ilie Pavel Cebanu from close range .
There was more to the striker 's celebration than just the fact Ireland had taken the initiative and taken the lead . It was just Murphy 's second goal for Ireland , but it was n't either long until he 'd trebled their pre-game account .
On 19 minutes , Wesley Hoolahan played one of their typically glorious crossfield balls to Ward , who then curled in a decent ball of their own . It was n't quite perfect , but Murphy 's header was . The Nottingham Forest striker agilely adjusted their body to deftly direct the ball back across goal , and into the corner of the net .
It was the first time in two years that Ireland had been 2-0 ahead at half-time at home , and the reasons for that were shown just minutes before the goal , after the misfiring Shane Long – the first-choice striker – missed a fine opportunity after good work from Callum O'Dowda .
That was the greater value to Murphy suddenly hitting the net twice and hitting form .

Ireland were n't completed composed yet , though , as reflected when Darren Randolph pulled off a fine save from a long-range Sergiu Platica piledriver .
A certain one-dimensional functionality to Ireland 's play has been a criticism of the O'Neill era even allowing for the fact this is one of the country 's weakest squads for some time , and it is something to concentrate on for the next spell of their time in charge - as is a tendency to sit back unnecessarily deep on taking a lead .
The latter became all too evident again in the second half , creating unnecessary nerves . Those nerves only got worse on the hour when Ireland finally broke through Hoolahan . For once , they picked the wrong pass when through on goal and in the box , the move eventually ending with Long trying to pick their spot in an open net , only for it to drop wide . You could see why they had gone 24 games without a goal for club or country .
Ireland did drop off a bit too much , but it did n't matter as Moldova 's frustrations rose , leading to Aleksandru Gatcan getting sent off in the final moments for head-butting Harry Arter . That was as hectic as it got , and is just as well given how tense and chaotic Cardiff is set to be . Just another manic Monday
This election was the one everyone lost
As someone who has always been interested in elections since studying Economics and Government 65 years ago , I have to say I do n't recall a previous election being anything like the one we have just had on June 8 .
This is because this was the election that everyone lost .
The Conservatives certainly lost , ending up with fewer seats than if they had not called the election .
Jeremy Corbyn lost because , despite promising the moon and green cheese – and targeting it to draw in students and pensioners , they still could n't get in .
The SNP lost big time , as well as losing seats , losing what became , in effect , a pre-run of ‘ Indy Ref 2 ' .
The Liberals had a torrid time .
The Greens ( leader Caroline Lucas pictured ) had little to lost yet managed to lose a bit .
I think the British people lost too , overall , now going into Brexit discussions with a hung Parliament .
Would it have been better if this election had never taken place ?
With the benefit of hindsight , I think the answer to that question is a resounding “ Yes ” .

Where was the political unity ?
In light of the recent attacks in Manchester and London , I 'm appalled to find that politicians are criticising each other over policies whilst people have lost loved ones and others are still suffering in much pain from their injuries in hospital .
I remember when the Dunblane massacre in Scotland occurred in the 1990s and both the Conservative and Labour parties effectively came together and combined their support for the victims in this , without one party criticising the other .
Sadly , in this day and
age , this seems not to be the case .
When the above acts of terrorism were committed , we 've had the politicians expressing their views with hardly any support shown for the victims .
In Dunblane , Tony Blair , whilst they stood side by side on the streets with John Major , said they were united in this struggle to find some way of dealing with these kinds of situations .

Not so many anti-frackers
So the self-proclaimed ‘ voice ' of the anti-fracking protest movement , Tina Rothery , was ‘ heard ' by just 1,263 supporters in the Fylde general election .
I 'm glad they said their Green Party campaign had been an “ interesting experience ” and they had taken “ great encouragement ” from the reaction to the fracking issue – because they certainly did n't get all-important votes !
Like all those who have stood in County and Parliamentary elections on an anti-fracking ticket before her , they lost – and lost badly .
It all goes to show that , despite the many far-fetched claims about the threats fracking poses , the people of Fylde are certainly not convinced . If there are that many anti-fracking supporters out there , surely they would have switched their political allegiances in greater numbers and made a strong statement at the ballot box .
The poll truly ‘ speaks ' volumes .

Laughing stock of the world
Our love as a nation for the underdog has taken this country into unchartered territory as a result of the usual cross-party mud-slinging and promises .
We have become the laughing stock of the world .
We have some extremely naive people in this land who think that if you are promised the earth ( NHS funding , free further education , more police officers etc ) it can be funded from nothing .
The majority of the younger voters have n't had to struggle through leaner times , where , before you achieved anything in life , you had to work extremely hard .
In the past , I had three jobs at the same time to enable me to buy the things I wanted , in a world where you saved up before you bought things , scrimped and saved and could n't rely on government hand-outs because there were n't any .
What sort of incentive is there in life for ambition and success if you are handed things on a plate ?
A government 's ideology of a shared pot , where we all provide for the poorer sections of our community is all fine and well .
The lessons have not been learned though that , in order to do this , there has to be a huge amount of the population earning well to be able to provide this .
How long is it before the hugely wealthy individuals and companies leave the
UK ? I must remember that the next time anyone has a majority in anything it means they have won .
It adds a new dimension to the truth .

A pointless reshuffle
Theresa May spent most of Sunday reshuffling their former Cabinet . Eighteen were returned to their former posts . Hardly in the class of the late Paul Daniels .
So does this mean more of the same ? If so , there will be a lot of nervous Tory politicians awaiting the next inevitable early election .

THE HAGUE , Netherlands ( AP ) — A Dutch safety watchdog says cross-border cooperation with neighboring Germany and Belgium needs to be improved to ensure the nations are properly prepared to deal with a nuclear accident that could impact all three countries .
The Dutch Safety Board issued a report Wednesday amid public concern over the safety of Belgian nuclear plants Doel and Tihange , but also looked at the Borselle and Emsland nuclear power plants in the Netherlands and Germany .
The watchdog said that in addition to improving crisis planning , the countries need to conduct more joint exercises and arrange coordination of measures they would take in the event of an accident .
The board says it `` takes a positive view '' of cooperation between the three countries aimed at preventing a nuclear accident .
The Supreme Court Tuesday hears arguments in a case challenging the constitutionality of a California state law requiring licensed “ crisis pregnancy centers '' — pro-life facilities that offer pregnancy-related services — to post notices advising clients that they are not medical facilities and that abortion and other services are available elsewhere .
The notice reads : “ California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services ( including all FDA-approved methods of contraception ) , prenatal care , and abortion for eligible women . ”
The National Institute of Family Advocates contends California 's FACT ACT , which stands for Freedom , Accountability , Comprehensive Care , and Transparency Act , violates the First Amendment right to free speech .
“ California imposes this compelled speech only on centers that oppose abortion , '' the group says . `` The Act does not impose these compelled statements across the board but uses broad exemptions to exclude health providers that provide or promote abortion or abortifacients . Therefore , the only ones forced by the State to speak these government messages are those who oppose abortion . ”
Mark Sherman/AP
Attorneys for California argue the disclosure notice the centers must post under the act , “ falls well within the First Amendment 's tolerance for the regulation of the practice-related speech of licensed professionals . ”
Attorneys for the state argue the FACT ACT provides needed information . “ A woman who seeks advice and care during pregnancy needs certain basic information to make informed decisions and obtain appropriate , timely medical care , '' they argue . `` When they are offered assistance by a facility that provides pregnancy-related services of a type the public may associate with medical clinics , they need to know whether the entity they are dealing with is in fact a state-licensed clinic staffed with regulated professionals . ''
`` And when they visit a state-licensed clinic that caters to those not covered by private insurance or already enrolled in public programs and provides less than the full spectrum of relevant health care , '' they say , `` she needs to know that there are state resources available to access additional care if they wish to do so . ”
The U.S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the California law . Both the Fourth and Second U.S . Circuit Courts of Appeals have struck down similar laws .
ABC News Supreme Court contributor Kate Shaw helps us understand the case :
What 's this case about ?
This case involves a First Amendment challenge to a California law called the “ Reproductive Freedom , Accountability , Comprehensive Care , and Transparency Act , ” popularly known as the FACT Act .
The FACT Act requires all pregnancy-related clinics in California to make certain disclosures . First , the law requires unlicensed pregnancy centers , which typically provide women with counseling , adoption services , free baby products , and other sorts of support , to post notices informing patients that they do not provide medical care .
Second , the law requires centers that are licensed to provide medical care to post notices explaining that publicly-funded family planning services , including contraception and abortion , are available in California .
A group of clinics , who call themselves “ pro-life pregnancy centers , ” have challenged the FACT Act , claiming that it violates their speech and religion rights under the First Amendment .
What are the two sides arguing ?
California claims it is simply imposing reasonable requirements to ensure that women do not inadvertently seek care at a center they believe to be a medical facility when in fact it is not , and that when centers do provide medical services like pregnancy tests and ultrasounds , they do not mislead women about their range of options .
The pregnancy centers argue that the state of California is forcing them to recite the state 's pro-abortion message , in violation of their religious convictions ; they argue that they exist to promote childbirth and that California is requiring them to highlight the possibility of abortion .
How might the Justices rule ?
The Justices could affirm the Ninth Circuit , which upheld that the FACT Act 's constitutionality . Or they could side with the challengers , striking down the FACT Act in its entirety . A third possibility is that they could uphold some but not all of the FACT Act—essentially the position of the Trump Justice Department , which has filed a brief arguing that they “ unlicensed clinic ” requirements are constitutional , but that the licensed clinic requirements are not .
This is the Court 's first significant abortion case since Justice Neil Gorsuch took the bench , so there will be a great deal of interest in how they vote in the case .
What is the national impact of this case ?
Pregnancy centers like the plaintiffs in this case operate in every state , so the Court 's ruling here could well have national impact—though even if the Court upholds California 's law , no state will be required to regulate these centers as California has done . If the Court sides with the centers , the state argues that pregnant women will be at risk of deception and misinformation at these centers , with state law essentially powerless to prevent it .
AUBURN HILLS , Mich. ( AP ) — Blake Griffin admits they were shocked by the trade that sent them from the Los Angeles Clippers to Detroit . The star forward says they want to be with a team that wants him .
Griffin , Brice Johnson and Willie Reed were introduced Wednesday by the Pistons , who acquired the trio earlier this week in a blockbuster deal with the Clippers . They should be available to play Thursday night when Detroit hosts the Memphis Grizzlies .
The Pistons sent Tobias Harris , Avery Bradley , Boban Marjanovic and two draft picks to the Clippers . The deal came seven months after Griffin signed a $ 171 million , five-year contract to stay with Los Angeles .
Griffin says the Pistons clearly want him , and that 's the kind of organization they want to play for .

Students and faculty of Florida International University returned to their Miami campus from spring break today and held a moment of silence to honor the six people killed in the collapse of a pedestrian bridge as lawyers for a man injured in the calamity filed a lawsuit
The moment of silence was held at 1:47 p.m. , the exact time the 950-ton span that was being built to connect FIU to neighboring community of Sweetwater came crashing down on cars on Thursday .
Jennifer Kay/AP
Several hundred students and faculty , including FIU President Mark Rosenberg , joined hands in front of the school 's Graham Center , where the school flag and the state flag were lowered to half-mast .
The ceremony honored the people killed , including Alexa Duran , an 18-year-old student at FIU . Others who died were Brandon Brownfield , 39 ; Oswald Gonzalez , 57 ; Alberto Arias , 54 ; Rolando Fraga Hernandez , 60 ; and Navarro Brown , 37 .
Five of the victims died when the 174-foot-long prefabricated section of the bridge collapsed on top of their vehicles as they were waiting under the span , which had just been put into place a few days earlier , for a traffic light to change , officials said . Brown was removed from the rubble alive , but later died at a hospital .

Meanwhile , lawyers for one of the people injured in the bridge failure filed a lawsuit in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court charging the five companies involved in the construction , oversight and design of the bridge with reckless negligence .
Orlando attorney Matt Morgan filed the lawsuit on behalf of Marquise Hepburn , 24 , who suffered significant injuries in the catastrophe .
Hepburn , according to the suit , was heading to work , riding a bicycle under the bridge on Southwest Eighth Street when the span gave way and they were hit by a vehicle that veered into him .
Hepburn , `` like many other unsuspecting victims , was simply performing ordinary activities and like many other victims of this horrific event was simply passing under the bridge without warning of increased danger , '' the lawsuit reads .
The suit claims the roadway beneath the bridge should have been closed to traffic at the time of the collapse .
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the disaster , but has yet to determine what caused the collapse .
On Friday , NTSB investigator Robert Accetta said work crews were applying post-tensioning force on the bridge support cables when the span fell down , but investigators are n't sure if that 's what caused the bridge to fall .
Officials also said Friday that an engineer left a voicemail with the Florida Department of Transportation two days before the bridge collapsed , reporting that cracks had been found at one end of the concrete span . The voicemail was n't picked up until after the collapse , however . NTSB officials are investigating the report , but said it 's not clear if cracks contributed to the bridge 's catastrophic failure .
Antoni Belchi/AFP/Getty Images
`` If there 's a crack in the bridge why is the motoring public still able to travel under the bridge ? That 's a fundamental question that needs to be answered in this case , '' Morgan said during a news conference today .
Among the companies named in the suit is FIGG Bridge Engineers , Inc. , which designed the bridge , and Munilla Construction Management , which was responsible for building it .
FIGG said in a statement : `` We are aware that a lawsuit has been announced regarding the pedestrian bridge accident . Our priority focus continues to place sympathies for the victims at the forefront of our thoughts . FIGG Bridge Engineers will work diligently with authorized investigators in an earnest ongoing effort to determine what led to the accident and what can be done to ensure that nothing like it happens again . ''
Munilla Construction did not respond to a request from ABC News for comment , but a message on the company 's answering machine , said , in part , `` We are all devastated and are doing everything we can to assist . We will conduct a full investigation and will cooperate in every way . ''

LOS ANGELES —Mingling with the scent of pumpkin spice in the air this October is the smell of charred starting pitchers .
In the first seven postseason games this month , starting pitchers on the best teams in baseball had given up 44 runs in 58 innings and failed to make it through three innings as often as they pitched into the sixth .
The Dodgers jumped on that trend – and Taijuan Walker . They sent nine batters to the plate and scored four runs in the first inning , going on to a 9-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in Game 1 of their best-of-five National League Division Series .
Walker 's rocky start was the price of admission to this NLDS for the Diamondbacks .
They used both Zack Greinke and Robbie Ray in Wednesday 's wild-card play-in game , leaving neither available to start Game 1 against the Dodgers . Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo gave the ball to the 25-year-old Walker , who acknowledged Thursday that the wild-card game had made them so nervous that they watched much of it on TV in the Diamondbacks ' clubhouse .
They were back in the clubhouse quickly Friday night . Walker failed to retire any of the first five Dodgers batters . After Chris Taylor led off with a single and Corey Seager drew a walk , Justin Turner launched a three-run home run 424 feet into the left field pavilion .
Cody Bellinger followed with a single and scored from first when Yasiel Puig doubled .
Walker 's night was done after 48 pitches and one inning .
That was the beginning of a five-RBI night for Turner ( tying the Dodgers ' franchise record for a postseason game ) . They drove in runs with singles in the fourth and eighth innings .
For Turner , the three-hit , five-RBI night extended their outstanding history in the postseason . In 19 career postseason games ( all with the Dodgers ) , they are 23 for 60 ( .383 ) with six doubles , a triple , three home runs and 17 RBI .
The postseason has never been as much fun for Clayton Kershaw . They did get their first postseason win at Dodger Stadium on Friday – a surprising statistic for a pitcher who is 80-31 there during the regular season .
But it was an unsettling performance by Kershaw . They struck out seven and allowed only three hits through the first six innings . But they did it relying on their fastball while finding little consistency with their slider and curveball . Two of the Diamondbacks ' three hits were solo home runs by A.J . Pollock and J.D . Martinez ( on a curveball ) .
Kershaw did pitch into the seventh inning – and probably should n't have . That has been a dark alley for them in the postseason . They have pitched into the seventh inning nine times in the postseason and allowed 17 runs in those seventh innings , posting a zero only three times .
The trend continued Friday . Kershaw retired the first batter then gave up back-to-back home runs to Ketel Marte and light-hitting catcher Jeff Mathis ( seven home runs between them during the regular season ) before Dodgers manager Dave Roberts came to get him .
It was just another home run first in a season filled with them for Kershaw . They gave up a career-high 23 home runs during the season , including a grand slam ( the first they had ever allowed ) and four in one game ( a personal first ) .
Now , they are the first pitcher in Dodgers franchise history to surrender four home runs in a postseason game .

NEW YORK ( AP ) — Actor Scott Baio adamantly denies sexually abusing an underage co-star and says they seduced them once when they were 18 and legally an adult .
Baio said Wednesday on ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' that `` false allegations '' against them have `` got to stop '' for the sake of their wife and 10-year-old daughter .
On Tuesday , Nicole Eggert said their former `` Charles in Charge '' co-star molested them for years , starting when they were 14 .
Baio says that would have been `` absolutely impossible '' on a set filled with teachers , relatives , crew members and producers .
They say Eggert `` makes up '' things , and he 's `` not the first person '' to become a target .
Eggert says they are exploring legal options and is considering filing a police report .
Baio says that would n't bother them because they did n't do anything wrong .
DUBAI , United Arab Emirates ( AP ) — A deal between the United States and Qatar for F-15 fighter jets and a visit by two American warships to Doha are showing the vital military links Washington maintains to the country now at the center of a dispute with Arab nations .
Qatar has signed what it described as a $ 12 billion for the fighter jets . In November , the U.S. military announced a similar fighter jet deal for $ 21.1 billion . It 's unclear if they are the same deal .
Meanwhile , Cmdr . Bill Urban of the U.S. Navy 's 5th Fleet told The Associated Press that the USS Chinook , a coastal patrol ship , and U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Baranof both were in Doha for `` a routine port visit '' on Thursday .
Qatar is home to 10,000 American troops and a major U.S. military base .
Although Donald Trump said this weekend that they know “ things that other people do n't know ” about email hacking , they have also repeatedly admitted that they are “ not an email person ” and “ almost never ” sends it .
Asked Saturday about the Russian hacking allegations , President-elect Trump continued to cast doubt on the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies .
“ If you look at the weapons of mass destruction , that was a disaster , and they were wrong . And so I want them to be sure , ” Trump told reporters at their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach , Florida , apparently referring to U.S. intelligence .
“ I think it 's unfair if they do n't know . And I know a lot about hacking . And hacking is a very hard thing to prove . So it could be somebody else . And I also know things that other people do n't know , and so they can not be sure of the situation , ” they added .
Trump 's weekend comments were far from the first time they have weighed in on cybersecurity , dating back to the presidential campaign when they repeatedly said they do n't trust email , so rarely uses it .
“ I 'm not an email person myself . I do n't believe in it , ” they said at an event in Doral , Florida , July 27 . “ I think it can be hacked , for one thing . When I send an email , I mean , if I send one , I send one almost never . I 'm just not a believer in email . A lot of people have taught me that , including Hillary [ Clinton ] . But , honestly , it could be maybe attacked . Who knows . ”
Two days later , they talked about how widespread hacking was and , specifically , said Russia is apparently “ excellent ” at it .
“ The hacking is all over the place . I hear China is brutal . They say Russia is excellent , ” they said at a July 29 town hall event in Colorado Springs , Colorado .
“ And you have guys sitting in their home that are very good . You have people , men and women , sitting in their homes that are better than the people that are the inventors . ”
Trump also talked in July about how they prefer the idea of using couriers to transport top-secret information , especially when it pertains to military intelligence .
“ I guarantee you General George Patton , who was rough as hell , they would n't be doing emails when he 's going to be ready to attack . If they were around , he 'd say , ‘ I do n't like that system at all , ' ” Trump said .
Trump apparently intends to take the idea to heart , saying Saturday that they will place an emphasis on such self-described “ old school ” tactics when it comes to keeping information protected during the Trump administration .
“ If you have something really important , write it out and have it delivered by courier , the old-fashioned way because I 'll tell you what , no computer is safe , ” Trump said in Palm Beach .
“ I do n't care what they say , no computer is safe . I have a boy who 's ten years old . They can do anything with a computer . You want something to really go without detection , write it out and have it sent by courier . ”
BOGOTA , Colombia ( AP ) — Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos on Monday suspended peace talks with the country 's last remaining rebel group after a series of bombings over the weekend killed seven police officers .
The next round of the year-old talks between the government and National Liberation Army had been expected to begin in the coming days in Quito , Ecuador .
`` My patience and the patience of the Colombian people have limits , '' Santos , winner of the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end Colombia 's half-century conflict , said at an event near Bogota .
Five officers were killed and more than 40 injured when a homemade bomb exploded outside a police station in Barranquilla during a shift change early Saturday . A few hours later two more were killed and several injured by two separate bomb attacks on police targets near the coastal city .
An urban cell belonging to the ELN , as the group is known in Spanish , claimed responsibility for the first and deadliest of the three attacks , which the government initially attributed to a criminal gang operating in Barranquilla . Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas said a man suspected of planting the bomb and who had previously been arrested for having ties to the ELN was arrested shortly after the first attack .
In a statement Monday , the rebel group expressed its continued support for peace talks . But it said the re-establishment of a cease-fire that expired earlier this month depends on the government halting hostilities in areas under its influence .
`` Until we reach another cease-fire , the military actions will continue taking place on each side , '' the group said .
Santos reached a peace agreement with what had been the nation 's largest rebel group , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , in late 2016 , ending Latin America 's longest-running conflict . The end of that conflict has been hailed internationally , though it has also opened a new power struggle in remote areas previously controlled by FARC rebels and still occupied by ELN combatants .
The much-smaller ELN , whose ranks do n't surpass 2,000 fighters , was started in the 1960s by Roman Catholic priests inspired by Fidel Castro 's revolution in Cuba . Unlike the highly centralized FARC , the ELN 's command structure is more diffuse , making it harder for top commanders in Ecuador to control the actions of its fighters .
The group is labeled a terrorist organization by the United States .

SEOUL , South Korea ( AP ) — Blockchain technology can make transactions safe and secure , but crypto-currency exchanges trading bitcoins and other virtual currencies that are based on this technology have been hacked because they are not working on secure networks , experts say . Late last week , the Tokyo-based Coincheck exchange reported a 58 billion yen ( $ 530 million ) loss of crypto currency due to hacking . The Coincheck exchange has halted trading of the stolen currency , NEM and restricted dealings in most other crypto currencies . It was the second major hacking assault on a Japanese crypto exchange after the Mt . Gox debacle in 2014 . Here 's a look at the security concerns surrounding crypto currencies .

WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN ?
As its name implies , blockchain is a chain of digital `` blocks '' that contain records of transactions , says Curtis Miles at IBM Blockchain . Each such block is connected to those before and behind it , making tampering difficult because a hacker would need to change the block containing that record and all those linked to it to avoid detection . The records on a blockchain are secured through cryptography and network participants have private keys assigned to their transactions that act as personal digital signatures . Any alteration will make those signatures invalid and alert others in the network to the changes . Blockchains are kept in so-called `` peer-to-peer '' networks that are continually updated and synchronized . Huge amounts of computing power would be required to access every instance of a certain blockchain and alter all its blocks simultaneously .
___
POOR SECURITY
While a blockchain can be secure , the exchanges that are crucial in increasing the amount of crypto trading , enabling bitcoin and other such currencies go mainstream , do not use the same technology , says Simon Choi , a director at anti-virus software company Hauri Inc. South Korean exchanges reportedly get poor reviews for cybersecurity , and officials have said those that fail to beef up such precautions will face fines . `` If security on the exchanges ' is not secure , their currencies can be stolen , '' Choi said . `` If the exchanges are to play their intermediary role , they should be as safe as banks and strengthen their security . ''
___
RISING HACKS
According to crypto currency research firm Chainalysis , losses of bitcoin , including stealing individuals ' holdings through scams , malicious computer software known as ransomware and hacks , increased at least 30 times to $ 95 million in 2016 from at least $ 3 million in 2013 .
The attack on Coincheck , which did not affect its holdings of bitcoin , was the second major hacking assault on a Japanese crypto exchange after Mt . Gox , the world 's largest bitcoin trading exchange before its collapse , lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins likely stolen through hacking .
Coincheck has apologized and promised to reimburse customers for their NEM losses . It has pledged to comply with a Financial Services Agency 's order to determine why the losses happened , and improve its security to prevent a recurrence .
Details of how the losses happened or who might be behind them are still unclear .
The Mt . Gox case put many Japanese investors off bitcoin , at least for a time , and prompted authorities to impose more regulations . Chainalysis estimates that the bitcoins lost at Mt . Gox were worth $ 7.5 million at the time the coins were stolen but now worth nearly $ 10 billion as of January .
___
IDENTIFYING HACKERS
It 's possible to trace blockchain transactions but not to identify the owners of the `` wallets '' where the crypto currencies are kept , says Choi .
`` It 's the biggest weakness , '' said Choi . `` You can track the blocks based on the records in the blocks but you can not tell whose wallet it is . They went to hackers ' wallet but if we do n't know who the hackers are we can not catch them . ''
The rising hacks have prompted the crypto community to seek ways to halt the bad guys .
South Korea 's government is trying to make crypto transactions traceable by implementing a system that links crypto accounts to existing bank accounts that have been vetted by financial institutions . Such efforts however will not help identify hackers if they send crypto currencies to exchanges outside Korea that do not identify their users .

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) — Bruce Brown , director of the classic surfing film `` The Endless Summer , '' has died . They were 80 .
The general manager of Brown 's film company Alex Mecl says Brown died Sunday in Santa Barbara , California , of natural causes .
Brown and their 1966 documentary `` The Endless Summer '' created the modern image of surfers as spiritual seekers on a quest , rather than thugs or buffoons .
And , along with the Beach Boys , they took surfing from a quirky hobby to a fundamental part of American culture .
`` Endless Summer '' was actually Brown 's sixth surfing film , and like all the others it was shot on a tiny budget with Brown performing nearly every duty , from camera man to narrator .
The film follows two surfers as they hop hemispheres to constantly surf wherever it is summer .
Their charisma and the film 's beauty made it an unlikely hit .
MINNEAPOLIS & REHOVOT , Israel -- ( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Apr 23 , 2018 -- Stratas y s Ltd. ( NASDAQ : SSYS ) , a global leader in additive technology solutions , today further pushed the envelope of what 's possible with 3D printed prototypes - empowering customers to deliver highly realistic , vibrantly-colored parts at speeds up to 5x - 10X faster and more cost effective than traditional manufacturing . Designed to shrink development cycles and time-to-market , the enhanced Stratasys J750 3D Printer - alongside the new Stratasys J735 3D Printer - enables designers and engineers to build highly realistic prototypes with streamlined design-to-prototype workflows , thus decreasing both time-to-market and time-to-revenue .

Stratasys vivid colors , color matching , and clear with texture functionality is well-suited to meet the 3D printed prototype demands of auto manufacturers ( Photo : Business Wire )
Now offering in excess of 500,000 color combinations via a new vivid color package , highly accurate color matching , and advanced clear with texture functionality - the PolyJet-driven systems create prototypes that look , feel and operate like finished products . Eliminating costly requirements for painting , assembly , or post-processing – both systems shrink prototype cycles by producing parts that are both reliable and consistent , print-after-print . Enhanced GrabCAD Print software - now also available for the Connex3 3D Printer - further improves workflows and functional prototyping for parts requiring ABS-level plastic simulation and tear-resistant rubber-like parts .
“ With the new vivid colors solution on the J750 3D Printer , we are able to produce prototypes with incredible realism , such as the transparent multi-color covers for our tail lights . This can offer the texture and color-matching requirements to meet our design approval process , ” says Reinhard Schiechel & Dr. Tim Spiering , Audi Model shop and 3D printing center . “ This ability to produce transparent multi-color prototypes that so closely mimic the final part , in a single print , might significantly reduce time and cost required for each design process . Consequently , we could free capacities to run through more iterations and improve overall design , while accelerating our time-to-market . ”
The newly advanced J750 and J735 are engineered to power prototype creation in industries ranging from automotive and consumer goods to research and education . Building true representations of final products for successful design verification , functional performance testing and fit/form applications , both PolyJet 3D Printers simulate parts with full color and textures - ranging from rigid to flexible , transparent to opaque . Additionally , two new materials - VeroYellowV and VeroMagentaV - deliver enhanced red/orange/yellow colors with next stage translucency , a perfect match for consumer goods and models used to represent automotive lights and housing . These advanced colors are available both on the J750 and J735 3D Printers - and now the Connex3 3D Printer .
“ Some of the biggest challenges designers and manufacturers face are 3D printed prototypes that fail to deliver the realism necessary to make them actionable . The advanced Stratasys J750 and newly announced Stratasys J735 3D Printers were engineered to eliminate these roadblocks , ” said Rich Garrity , President Americas , Stratasys . “ When combined with a GrabCAD Print solution that further improves design-to-3D print processes - it 's now easier than ever before for manufacturers to create better prototypes , more accurately and on-demand . This shrinks the entire design-to-final part manufacturing process . ”
The power of PolyJet is actively being used by award-winning stop-motion animators at LAIKA – who count on Stratasys to ensure naturalistic facial animation for its puppets - as seen in such critically-acclaimed films as “ Coraline ” and “ Kubo and the Two Strings. ” According to Brian McLean , Director of Rapid Prototype for LAIKA , enhanced colors and voxel-level control are essential for the characters in their unannounced , and highly anticipated new stop-motion animated film .
“ Being able to have a 3D printer like the Stratasys J750 that 's dimensionally-accurate , repeatable and with an improved range of color has allowed us to break down creative , and technical barriers , ” McLean noted . “ For our next film , unannounced , we used Stratasys ' new color 3D printing technology and another voxel slicing software package . This combination of hardware and software allowed us to achieve a level of detail and subtlety in facial animation that was previously unattainable . ”
Taking the power of the Stratasys J750 and J735 3D Printers - and now the Connex3 - one step further is GrabCAD Print™ , allowing designers to 3D print directly from native CAD formats and saving time typically used to convert and fix STL files . The software also has new ability to 3D print VRML files to power more realistic textures , images and graphics on-part . Detailed views of model , tray and slice preview further shrink time-to-design to make adjustments before going to final 3D print .
Stratasys is exclusively showcasing its advanced solutions - alongside its wealth of part realism , clear with texture functionality and advanced part profiles - this week at Rapid + TCT 2018 : the 3D printing and additive manufacturing event at the Fort Worth Convention Center in Fort Worth , TX .

SEATTLE — On a day when the Angels took Garrett Richards off the disabled list , they lost Tyler Skaggs .
That sums up the team 's injury-marred season , one that has now seen them use the disabled list for 21 players , including two stints for two of them .
Skaggs , who has been the Angels the best starter this year , was diagnosed with a strain of their right adductor , which is a muscle on the inside of the thigh . There was no immediate word on the severity of the injury or when it happened because the announcement of the injury was made after Manager Mike Scioscia had spoken to the reporters and the Angels clubhouse was closed to the media .
Skaggs had missed a start last month with right hamstring tightness , but they did n't go on the disabled list . They came back and pitched twice , including Saturday in Baltimore . They left that game after 79 pitches because they said they were “ exhausted ” by the heat .
Skaggs was asked specifically about any injuries on Saturday and Sunday , and they indicated they were fine . They threw a bullpen session before Tuesday 's game .
Skaggs ' absence means Jaime Barría will start the series finale against the Mariners on Thursday . Barría initially had been pushed back a day so Skaggs could start against the Mariners .
The Angels have now had 10 starting pitchers go on the disabled list this year , including Parker Bridwell on the Triple-A DL . That includes Alex Meyer , who had shoulder surgery last year and was expected to miss the entire season . It also includes John Lamb , who was promoted because of the injuries and ended up needing Tommy John surgery after three starts .
Barría , 21 , is the only one of the nine starters the Angels had on their original depth chart who has not been hurt this year .
Deck McGuire , who on Sunday became the 12th pitcher to start for the Angels this season , was recalled on Wednesday to take Skaggs ' spot , a day after they had been optioned .
It 's unclear how the Angels will fill out their rotation beyond Thursday 's game , but the most obvious plan would be Felix Peña on Friday and McGuire on Saturday against the Dodgers . Andrew Heaney could pitch again on Sunday .
ALSO
Jabari Blash was recalled to take the spot of Chris Young , who was placed on the disabled list with a strained left hamstring suffered on Tuesday night . …
Kaleb Cowart was optioned to create a spot for Richards , who was activated to pitch on Wednesday after missing three weeks with a hamstring injury .

The National Theatre 's acclaimed production of War Horse spends Christmas at New Theatre , Oxford , offering families an alternative to the festive pantomimes .
The tour of War Horse , which started in September and goes through to next year , coincides with the centenary commemorations of the end of the First World War .
The production , adapted from Michael Morpurgo 's remarkable story of courage , loyalty and friendship , about a young boy called Albert and their horse Joey , set against the backdrop of the First World War , is the most successful play in the National Theatre 's history .
It features groundbreaking puppetry work by South Africa 's Handspring Puppet Company which brings breathing , galloping horses to life on stage .
Albert ( played by Thomas Dennis in the tour ) and their beloved horse , Joey , live on a farm in the British countryside . At the outbreak of war , Albert and Joey are forcibly parted when Albert 's father sells the horse to the British cavalry . Against the backdrop of the Great War , Joey begins an odyssey full of danger , joy and sorrow , and they transform everyone they meet along the way . Meanwhile Albert , unable to forget their equine friend , searches the battlefields of France to find Joey and bring them home .
Mr Morpurgo was inspired to write War Horse after talking to old soldiers from the First World War . They said : “ The more I heard , the more I felt that any story I might want to write about this war had to be written not from a British perspective , not even from a French or German or Belgian one . It had to be the story of the suffering and grieving on all sides , military and civilian too . I needed to tell a story that reflected the universal pity of war . ”
Mr Murpurgo admits that their book , although well liked , was not initially the best seller . It was its transformation by the National Theatre into a stunning stage production , that saw the story reach so many people and garner awards by the dozen .
They say they often go to Ypres to research their stories , and when there they visit the war cemeteries . They said : “ I am struck always by how many British people are there , Australians too , and Canadians , and New Zealanders , but how very few Germans are there . Yet their fathers and sons , their brothers and uncles , who left their homes a hundred years ago died in even greater numbers than ours . Their boys went to war for much the same reasons ours did , patriotism , pride , for adventure , because they were told to . Their deaths were as terrible , the sense of loss at home just as grievous . Yet it would seem that even now , the shadow of the Hitler War does not allow them to remember as we do , those who died in the First World War . ”
They said they hoped that the play of War Horse , and the book and film , could play a small part in a new beginning of reconciliation and understanding .
Thomas Dennis , who plays Albert , embarked on a research trip across Northern France and the Western Front , following in the footsteps of Joey and Albert . They said : “ I believe this show to be a commemoration of all the men , women and horses that gave their lives in the Great War , so to see the landscapes and read the names on the gravestones , allows me to connect deeply to the subject matter of the piece . “
War Horse is at New Theatre , Oxford from Wednesday December 13 - Saturday January 6 . Tickets cost from £21.40 , discounts available . Box office 0844 871 3020 or www.atgtickets.com/oxford
KINGSPORT , TN ( WJHL ) – Kingsport Police said two people walked into a local hospital with gunshot wounds and they are working to figure out what happened .

What a season for Aaron Rodgers . After the Packers got off to a slow start , we jumped the gun by a few weeks and claimed Rodgers was “ back ” from their struggles when the Packers were at 4-3 . Three weeks later , they were sitting at 4-6 , on the edge of falling out of the playoff race . Sure , the issues in Green Bay stemmed more from the ragged pass defense and nonexistent run game , but still — it was grim . Rodgers , however , publicly said , “ I feel like we can run the table , ” which earned scoffs at the time , but lo it has come to pass .
The Packers finished the 2016 season on a six-game winning streak , capped off with a primetime victory over the Detroit Lions to once again win the NFC North . The Lions ended their year on a three-game losing streak , and now have to travel to Seattle if they want to keep their season alive past Wild Card weekend . The Packers ' defense is now as injured as it 's ever been in the secondary , but even with castoffs manning the outside , the Lions could n't keep pace with Rodgers at their best .
You could feel the pressure the Lions were under to keep pace with the Green Bay offense every time they had the ball , and it resulted in Matthew Stafford forcing a lot of throws to score quickly , like the decisive interception late in the game , which Stafford forced to Golden Tate at the goal line when Micah Hyde was draped all over him . Hyde played well in the game , but he 'll likely be picked on by opposing quarterbacks in the postseason .
PITTSBURGH ( AP ) — Ben Roethlisberger 's record-setting day finished with a carry just as valuable as any of the franchise-record 66 passes they threw .
As the Pittsburgh Steelers poured onto the Heinz Field turf to celebrate a frantic 39-38 victory over Baltimore that wrapped up their third AFC North title in four years , Roethlisberger grabbed the familiar No . 50 jersey of injured linebacker Ryan Shazier and joined in the party .
An emotionally draining week for the Steelers ended with Shazier recovering from spinal surgery in a nearby hospital but still very much in the middle of things . Just like always .
`` We love our brother , '' Roethlisberger said . `` We wanted to get this one for him , and I 'm glad we did . ''
Barely .
The Steelers ( 11-2 ) blew an early 14-point lead and found themselves trailing by 11 going into the fourth before exploding for 19 points over the final 15 minutes , the last three coming on Chris Boswell 's 46-yard field goal with 42 seconds left .
`` I think championship teams find ways to win , '' Roethlisberger said .
Having an offense that is starting to peak after a sleepy start certainly helps . Roethlisberger threw for 506 yards and two scores to become the first player in NFL history to go over 500 yards passing three times in their career . Antonio Brown caught 11 passes for 213 yards to fuel an MVP candidacy that no longer feels so far-fetched , including gains of 57 and 34 yards in the fourth to spark Pittsburgh 's comeback and running back Le'Veon Bell finished with 125 total yards and three scores .
`` It 's an amazing feeling , especially for Ryan Shazier , '' Brown said . `` One of our brothers could n't be out here today . Obviously , they are watching . ''
Shazier suffered their injury in the first quarter of a victory over Cincinnati last Monday . They underwent surgery on Wednesday and Roethlisberger visited them on Thursday .
`` When you walk in and see them and see the smile and give them a huge , it really has taken that weight off and let us breathe a little easier , '' Roethlisberger said .
The Steelers have done their best to let Shazier know is very much a part of their run . Linebacker James Harrison borrowed a page from Shazier 's pregame routine and warmed up shirtless even with the temperature hovering around freezing . Shazier 's helmet and jersey spent the game on the bench and several Steelers wore cleats with a special design featuring Shazier 's face and the popular # Shalieve hashtag .
`` It was very emotional , '' linebacker Arthur Moats said . `` Any time you can bring something to them that brings them some type of joy , some type of happiness , that 's good . At the end of the day we 're just trying to make sure he 's good . ''
RAVENS ROCKED
Baltimore ( 7-6 ) meanwhile , saw its surge back to contention blunted after its defense spent the fourth quarter fruitlessly chasing Brown from one side of the field to the other .
`` This is going to sting for a while , '' Ravens safety Eric Weddle said . `` Especially the guys on defense because we care so much and we hold ourselves to a high standard . ''
The Ravens certainly did n't meet it after giving up 545 yards to the Steelers . Pittsburgh scored on its last four possessions . It 's not like the Steelers were taking advantage of a short field . All eight of their scoring drives went at least 50 yards , including two of 80 or more .
`` I think in the fourth quarter the defense dropped the ball tonight , '' linebacker Terrell Suggs said . `` That 's kind of been our thing all year , consistency . ''
SUPER SHOWDOWN
The win sets up the AFC game of the year next Sunday when Tom Brady and the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots visit . New England beat the Steelers twice last season , including a lopsided 36-17 blowout in the AFC title game .
`` We 're going to give respect where respect is due now , '' Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey said . `` But they 're not Superman . They lost this season , right ? ''
ALL-AROUND EFFORT
Brown , Bell and Roethlisberger hardly did it alone . Boswell has hit four game-winning field goals in the final minute in four of Pittsburgh 's past five games . Tight ends Jessie James and Vance McDonald combined for 14 receptions for 149 yards . Even fullback Roosevelt Nix got in on the act , scoring their first career touchdown on a 1-yard reception in which they basically pulled the ball off Baltimore safety Tony Jefferson 's chest as they tussled in the end zone .
`` AB is gon na do what they do , I 'm going to do what I do , Ben 's gon na do what they do , '' Bell said . `` But it 's the guys who do n't get the credit always that are the ones making the plays . ''
UP NEXT
Baltimore : Needs to win out if it wants to reach the postseason . The good news ? Their final three opponents are a combined 8-34 , including the 0-13 Cleveland Browns , who the Ravens visit next Sunday .
Pittsburgh : The Steelers have beaten Brady at Heinz Field just once in their career , a victory in the 2011 regular season .

BEIRUT ( AP ) — Islamic State media outlets are reporting that the son of the group 's leader has been killed fighting Syrian government forces .
The announcement of the death of the young son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appeared on the group 's social media accounts late Tuesday . It included a picture of a young boy carrying a rifle and identified them as Huthaifa al-Badri .
The statement did not specify when they were killed . It said they were an elite fighter who was killed while fighting Syrian and Russia troops at a power station in the central Homs province .
Al-Baghdadi has been reported killed or wounded on a number of occasions but is widely believed to still be alive . IS has been driven from nearly all the territory it once controlled in Syria and Iraq .
WARSAW , Poland ( AP ) — The Polish Senate has begun debating a law regulating Holocaust speech which has sparked a diplomatic dispute with Israel .
Senate approval , expected late Wednesday or Thursday , will put the controversial bill a step closer to becoming law . It must still be signed into law by the president , who supports it .
Poland 's conservative ruling Law and Justice party authored the bill . It foresees up to three years of prison for any intentional attempt to falsely attribute the crimes of Nazi Germany to the Polish state or people .
Law and Justice says it is fighting the usage of phrases like `` Polish death camps '' to refer to death camps operated by Nazi Germany .
Israel sees an attempt to whitewash the role some Poles played in the killing of Jews during World War II .
PHILADELPHIA -- ( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Apr 24 , 2018 -- Franchise law firm Spadea Lignana has introduced a NEW , custom designed , cloud-based software system to streamline franchise sales and compliance for franchisors . The system enables franchise development professionals to send a link directly through email or their CRM system taking candidates to a custom map with a simple red/green interface allowing the candidates to download the correct FDD approved in specific states .
This press release features multimedia . View the full release here : https : //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424005100/en/
The system was developed with feedback from national franchisors , industry experts and franchise sales professionals looking for a better way to manage the onerous process of knowing where franchisors are allowed to sell , and which FDD they must deliver to candidates . It is not unusual , even for experienced franchisors and salespeople , to send an outdated FDD or lose track of which states they are currently registered in , especially this time of year , as franchisors scramble to update their FDD and renew registrations in multiple states .

Southwest Airlines runs its planes hard . They make many short hops and more trips per day than other U.S. airliners , which adds to wear and tear on parts , including the engines .
As the investigation into last week 's deadly engine failure continues , Southwest CEO Gary Kelly could face questions about whether the company 's low-cost business model — which puts its planes through frequent takeoffs and landings — is putting passengers at risk .
National Transportation Safety Board investigators examine damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane that made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia on Tuesday , April 17 , 2018 . The Southwest Airlines jet blew the engine at 32,000 feet and got hit by shrapnel that smashed a window , setting off a desperate scramble by passengers to save a woman from getting sucked out . They later died , and seven others were injured . ( NTSB via AP )

A preliminary examination of the blown jet engine that set off a terrifying chain of events showed evidence of “ metal fatigue , ” according to the National Transportation Safety Board .

Warren , File )
Some aviation safety experts said they see no reason for alarm . And , in fact , Southwest 's safety record is enviable : Until last week , no passenger had died in an accident during its 47-year history .
Still , the Dallas-based airline has paid millions over the past decade to settle safety violations , including fines for flying planes that did n't have required repairs . Twice in the past nine years , holes have torn open in the roofs of Southwest planes in flight .
In another episode in 2016 , an engine on a Southwest jet blew apart over Florida because of metal fatigue , or wear and tear , hurling debris that struck the fuselage and tail . No one was hurt .
Then , last week , one of the engines on Southwest Flight 1380 blew apart at 32,000 feet over Pennsylvania , spraying the Boeing 737 with shrapnel and killing 43-year-old Jennifer Riordan , a mother of two who was blown partway out a broken window . The National Transportation Safety Board said a fan blade that had snapped off the engine was showing signs of metal fatigue .
The union representing Southwest mechanics recently accused the company of pressuring maintenance workers to cut corners to keep planes flying . And the Federal Aviation Administration investigated union whistleblower complaints and found mistrust of management so serious that it could hurt safety .
In one case , investigators said a worker who should have been praised for finding corrosion on a plane in Dallas was chastised for working beyond the scope of the task they had been assigned . The leader of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association , Bret Oestreich , said Southwest had created a culture of hostility and retaliation .
Nevertheless , aviation safety experts and longtime industry watchers said they do not consider Southwest unsafe .
“ They have had a lot ” of incidents , said John Goglia , a former NTSB member , “ but you have to remember that they have a very large fleet ” — more than 700 Boeing 737s , the largest 737 fleet in the world .
Before last week , if Goglia thought about airlines that might have safety questions , Southwest was n't even on the radar , they said .
Southwest 's short , frequent flights put more stress on the plane and engines , like a car used heavily in stop-and-go city traffic , said Alan Diehl , an aviation-safety consultant and former NTSB and Air Force accident investigator .
Diehl said , however , that Southwest 's crews are accustomed to the quicker pace and that their work is made easier because Southwest flies only Boeing 737s instead of an assortment of planes .
Southwest jets make on average 5.3 flights per day compared with between 2.8 and 3.4 per day at American Airlines , Delta and United , according to an analysis by industry newsletter Airline Weekly using information from airline data provider Diio .
Southwest flies frequently on short routes such as Los Angeles to San Francisco and Dallas to Houston . Its average flight is 764 miles , the shortest among U.S. airlines and barely half as long as the average at American and Delta , according to the Airline Weekly analysis . Each takeoff and landing contributes to wear and tear on the aircraft .
“ It 's amazing how safe Southwest has been over the years , considering the operational difficulty of what they do , ” said Seth Kaplan , managing partner of Airline Weekly . Like others interviewed for this story , Kaplan said they are not afraid to fly Southwest — they and their family are booked on a flight next week .
Although last week 's accident was Southwest 's first passenger fatality , it was not the first time someone was killed by one of its planes . In 2005 , a Southwest jet skidded off a runway and through a fence at Chicago 's Midway Airport , striking a car and killing a 6-year-old boy .
Southwest , the nation 's fourth-biggest airline by passenger traffic but the largest in terms of U.S.-only flights , has paid millions in fines after enforcement actions by the FAA .
The biggest FAA fine against Southwest was $ 7.5 million in 2009 . The FAA said Southwest kept 46 planes flying even though they had skipped critical inspections of the fuselage for metal fatigue .
Five years later , the FAA proposed a $ 12 million fine over 44 planes that had undergone improper fuselage repairs while at a contractor hired by Southwest . The airline settled a lawsuit by agreeing to pay $ 2.8 million .
The 2016 engine failure over Florida highlighted the need for closer inspection of engine blades . Southwest spokesperson Brandy King said that after engine maker CFM International recommended more inspections last year , Southwest had inspected all fan blades covered by the recommendation before last week 's accident .
King said the airline will meet a new CFM recommendation to inspect all older fan blades by the end of August . They said the airline is also inspecting all newer fan blades , a move not yet required by the FAA .
Southwest 's CEO has said many times before and since last week 's engine failure that safety is paramount at the airline .
Rather than hide from bad news , Kelly spoke to reporters just hours after the accident and promised to “ do all we can ” to help Riordan 's family .
“ His emotion was very real . It was palpable , ” said Henry Harteveldt , a travel-industry analyst . “ Mr . Kelly has done a very good job in communicating this to the public and leading the airline . ”
The day after the accident , Southwest sent letters from Kelly to passengers on Flight 1380 , saying that the airline would give them each $ 5,000 “ to cover any of your immediate financial needs ” and a $ 1,000 travel voucher .
Harteveldt said Southwest clearly hoped the letters might discourage lawsuits , “ but I thought it was a noble gesture . ”
New temporary visa class to have tougher requirements , prime minister says
The government will abolish the 457 temporary visa class , Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced today .
457 visas have been widely used by the technology sector , with some groups such as the IT Professionals Association ( ITPA ) claiming that they have been abused by employers .
“ We 're abolishing 457 visas – the visas to bring temporary foreign workers into our country , ” Turnbull said in a video posted on Facebook .
“ We will no longer allow 457 visas to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians . ”
The 457 visa will be replaced by a new temporary visa class , Turnbull said .
“ The new visa will better target genuine skills shortages , including in regional Australia , ” the PM said . “ It will include new requirements , including previous work experience , better English language proficiency and labour market testing . ”
The government will also establish a new training fund , Turnbull added .
Addressing a press conference this afternoon Turnbull and immigration minister Peter Dutton said that the existing four-year 457 visa class will be replaced with two new temporary visas .
A new medium-term visa will have a four-year term and cover a relatively narrow list of occupations . The four-year visa will require a “ higher standard of English ” and “ in almost all cases ” mandatory market testing , Turnbull said .
There will be capacity for visa renewal onshore and a permanent residence pathway after three years under the medium-term stream , the government said .
Another visa stream will have a two-year duration and cover a broader list of occupations , though the PM said that the occupations covered by the visa will be substantially reduced compared to the list of 200+ currently eligible for 457 visas .
At the end of the two years , there will be the possibility of lodging an onshore application for a two-year extension ; after four years , however , the visa holder would have to leave and their employer reapply .
The immigration department said the the occupation list for skilled migration visas , including 457 visas , will be significantly reduced from 19 April .
Both visa categories will require at least two years ' relevant work experience . There will be a minimum market salary rate ( currently $ 53,900 ) .
There are some 95,000 457 visa holders in Australia , according to the government . There will be a grandfathering arrangement for existing 457 visas .
Figures from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection reveal that as of 30 September , during the 2016-17 financial year Australia 's information media and telecommunications sector has lodged 2000 457 visa applications , up 4.8 per cent on the same point in 2015-16 .
The information media and telecommunications sector accounted for 14.4 per cent of all primary 457 visa applications in the period covering applications through to 30 September .
‘ Developer programmer ” was the second most popular occupation for 457 visa applications in the period covered by the immigration department 's report . ICT business analyst was fifth most popular ; software engineer came in at number seven and analyst programmer at number 13 .
Gunmen stormed an upscale cafe overnight in Burkina Faso 's capital , Ouagadougou , strafing the building with bullets and barricading themselves inside for hours . By the time security forces reclaimed the restaurant around dawn Monday , at least 18 people had been killed and eight others wounded , according to local authorities .
The West African nation 's communications minister , Remis Dandjinou , told reporters Monday that by daybreak , two of the attackers had been killed and several foreign nationals were among the dead . In separate statements , officials in Paris and Ankara confirmed the victims include a French citizen and Turkish citizen , while another Turk was injured in the violence .
While Burkinabe officials blamed Islamist militants for the attack on the Turkish cafe , no one group immediately claimed responsibility .
`` I salute the bravery of our security and defense forces whose engagement allowed us to neutralize the terrorists , '' Burkinabe President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said in a statement , as translated by CNN .
`` The struggle against terrorism is a lengthy fight , '' they added . `` That is why I am calling for vigilance , solidarity and unity of the whole nation to face up to the cowardice of our enemies . ''
In a news conference Monday , Dandjinou detailed the night 's bloody events , which opened when they say about three to four militants rolled up to the cafe on motorcycles around 9 p.m. local time . They opened fire on an outside seating area outside then moved indoors , where The New York Times notes a family had been celebrating a 9-year-old boy 's birthday .
The newspaper reports the boy was hospitalized with injuries from the attack .
For Burkinabes , the attack on Aziz Istanbul cafe , which is popular with foreigners , prompts bitter memories of another bloody episode just over 18 months ago . In January last year , militants conducted an hours-long raid on a luxury hotel and a cafe just blocks away from Aziz Istanbul , ultimately killing some 30 people before being dislodged by security forces .
Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb , a militant group based in the region , claimed responsibility for that attack — as well as another deadly assault just months before in neighboring Mali .
Islamist groups have been active for years in the Sahel region , which includes Mali and Burkina Faso . As groups linked to al-Qaida have carried out attacks in the area , the Times points out that the United Nations peacekeeping mission to Mali `` has become one of the most dangerous in the world . ''
The French government — which controlled Burkina Faso , then called Upper Volta , as a colony until 1960 — says President Emmanuel Macron met with Kabore on Monday to discuss the circumstances of the latest attack .
The pair of leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the formation of an international security force in the Sahel region to `` continue the fight against terrorist groups . ''
ANAHEIM — With the last ride of the night on SweetPro 's Bruiser , Cody Nance of Paris , Tenn. , won the 25th PBR Anaheim Invitational Saturday night with a score of 88.75 to edge World No . 6 rider Claudio Montanha Jr. of Brazil .
Nance , 30 , leaped from No . 61 in the World entering this weekend to a No . 9 ranking after their championship ride Saturday night at Honda Center .
“ Oh man , ( Sweetpro 's Bruiser ) is the World Champion Bucking Bull , ” Nance said . “ That 's the bull that everybody voted that was the best bull in the world last year .
“ I 've never been on them before and I was real glad to have the opportunity to ride him . When you finally sit and you wait and you finally get your chance and then things work out like you planned , there ai n't no words for it sometimes . ”
Riding the second-to-last bull of the night was Montanha on Catfish John . Co-owner Dave Miller was very proud of their bull that it ranked in the top 10 in the world and was ridden by Cooper Davis when they won the PBR World title in 2016 .
“ We were longtime fans of the PBR until we became part owners in 2015 , ” said Miller , who also had their bull in the championship round last weekend in Sacramento . “ I 'm having the time of my life . ”
In the second round on Saturday night World No . 1 Dener Barbosa showed the sold-out crowd at Honda Center why they are the top-ranked rider .
After a flawless ride on Friday , Barbosa again showed why he 's atop the heap after five events this season .
Barbosa was in control for the entire eight seconds and scored an 84.75 . That coupled with their first-round score of 84.25 gave them a 169 to finish as the No . 4 rider for the championship .
This is the 21st consecutive year that Anaheim has been a stop on the PBR tour . It 's the fifth stop of 26 events this year .
Only Billings , Mont. , and Albuquerque have hosted more events than Anaheim with 23 and 22 , respectively .
The World Finals are Nov. 7-11 In Las Vegas .
World No . 3 Ryan Dirteater , who was just 55 points behind Barbosa , had a tough-luck ride that lasted less than three seconds .
Dirteater , who has ridden 50 percent of their bulls ( 7 of 14 ) in six events this season , was knocked off the 67th-ranked bull , Beaver Creek Beau , just as they came out of the chute and did not immediately get up . They were helped up and went directly into the medical room and was taken out of the arena in an ambulance . Their condition was not immediately known .
After the second round on Saturday , the top 15 riders qualified for the championship round .
Only two of the first 27 riders ( Section 1-3 ) on Saturday in Round 2 had secured spots in the championship round after scoring both nights .
With only 11 riders gaining a score on Friday , four spots were left open for a chance at the top 15 that would advance to Saturday 's championship round . Eleven of the 37 riders ( 30 percent ) had scores on Friday .
The top 15 championship qualifiers : Cody Nance , riding SweetPro 's Bruiser , Claudio Montanha , Jr. ( Catfish John ) ; 3 . Silvano Alves , ( Wickid Stick ) ; 4 . Dener Barbosa , ( Mudshark ) ; 5 . Eduardo Aparecdio ( Jack Shot ) ; 6 . Jose Vitor Leme ( Pearl Harbor ) ; 7 . Tanner Byrne ( Frequent Flyer ) ; 8 . Stetson Lawrence ( Wild Goose ) ; 9 . Guiherme Marchi ( Smooth Operator ) ; 10 . Luciano De Castro ( Talking Smack ) ; 11 . Marco Eguchi ( Gambini ) ; 12 . Brennon Eldred ( Spotted Demon ) ; 13 . Kurt Shephard ( Speed Demon ) ; Fabiano Viera ( Heaertbreak Kid ) ; 15 . Jess Lockwood ( Deerango ) .
Only 11 of the 37 riders ( 30 percent ) from Round 1 on Friday scored .
Dirteater , riding the bull Renewed Spirit and No . 10 Stetson Lawrence , riding Red Sails in the Sunset , scored 87.5 to lead all riders .
Reigning 2017 World PBR champ Jess Lockwood , who did n't score on Friday night , scored a 79.25 on the last ride of the second round Saturday night . 2016 champion Cooper Davis failed to score on both nights .
The next stop on the 26-city tour is Kansas City on Feb. 9-10 .
CAMPBELL , Calif. -- ( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Apr 24 , 2018 -- Centric Software is proud to announce that the latest release of its flagship solution , Centric 8 PLM version 6.3 , is now available .

Centric Software Releases Centric 8 PLM V6.3 ( Photo : Business Wire )
Centric Software 's latest Product Lifecycle Management ( PLM ) release is driven by feedback from Centric 's Customer Advisory Board and customer innovation partners . At their request , Centric 8 v6.3 focuses heavily on streamlining the go-to-market of products destined for multiple markets and/or channels ; new Product Information Management ( PIM ) -like features improve the accuracy of global product information while new PLM features improve global orchestration of the supply chain .
“ As most brands , retailers and manufacturers today sell and source in multiple markets , there is a big demand to localize content as part of the product development process , ” explains Ron Watson , VP of Product at Centric Software . “ Preparing products for sale in different markets requires tracking local content and labeling regulations in addition to creating localized product descriptions and pricing . The amount of necessary product information multiplies exponentially , and users , managers and executives not only need one source of the truth and specialized tools to track it all , but also the ability to what-if , roll-up and analyze this information in order to make decisions that drive the financial success of the line . ”
Users can now develop once and sell globally in local currencies , languages and in compliance with local labeling requirements . They can create price lists by region , channel or country and they can also automate information for local product content/composition , care labels and other regulatory requirements . Time to market is greatly streamlined , work eliminated and the risk of error significantly reduced as the tedium of thousands of clicks and tracking via spreadsheets , or even paper , has been eliminated .
Global supply chain orchestration is also a key point in this release with new BOM Extension capabilities . As suppliers sometimes sub-contract all or part of the production of an order , it is extremely difficult for brands and retailers to have complete visibility into exactly how and who are involved in the production of goods . Centric 's BOM Extension links the Design BOM to the Manufacturing BOM to a new Factory BOM , which includes details about sub-contractors and local suppliers . Brands and retailers thus gain full visibility and transparency into the exact sources that are being used to produce goods which are necessary to ensure compliance with local regulations and labelling requirements , and also with company-specific business and ethical guidelines .
“ Creating innovative , new features and pushing the boundaries of traditional PLM is the cornerstone of Centric 's success . We partner with our customers to provide brands , retailers and manufacturers of all sizes the most innovative enterprise solutions specific to their strategic and operational digital transformation goals , ” says Chris Groves , President and CEO of Centric Software . “ Centric focuses on providing powerful and efficient solutions for our customers to give them a competitive advantage in an increasingly global marketplace . ”

Despite losing 12 of its last 18 games -- including a dispirited 120-88 loss to visiting Houston on Saturday night -- Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue 's job is safe , league sources told ESPN .
`` We are not firing our head coach , '' one cavalier official told ESPN late Saturday night .
The Cavaliers are planning to continue pursuing deals to improve the floundering team between now and Thursday 's NBA trade deadline , league sources said .
The Cavaliers , including LeBron James , were listless in the loss to the Rockets on national television Saturday night . Cleveland has had a series of blowout losses to drop to 30-21 -- a half-game ahead of Washington in third place in the Eastern Conference and only 1.5 games ahead of Indiana .
Lue has expressed frustration with the team , describing the Cavaliers to ESPN 's Lisa Salters at halftime of Saturday 's loss as `` soft , weak , no physicality , no toughness , no grit . ''
Cleveland has lost All-Star forward Kevin Love for two months with a fractured left hand , is failing to defend and is fighting internal disconnects as it tries to restore itself to Eastern Conference championship contention .
Lue was promoted to head coach halfway through the 2015-16 NBA season and led the Cavaliers to an NBA Finals victory over Golden State . The Cavaliers lost in the Finals to the Warriors last season .
Lue is 29-10 ( .744 ) in their two trips to the NBA playoffs as Cavaliers coach .
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS & USED WITH PERMISSION
Oklahoma Republican Rep. Jim Bridenstine resigned from the House of Representatives Monday and was sworn in as NASA 's 13th administrator by Vice President Mike Pence , chairperson of the recently revitalized National Space Council .
“ Last December , President Trump … signed the first set of National Space Council recommendations under Space Policy Directive 1 , ” Pence said during a brief ceremony at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
“ We will send American astronauts back to the moon , and after that we will establish the capacity , with international and commercial partners , to send Americans to Mars , ” they said . “ And NASA will lead the way . ”
They praised Bridenstine and said they and the president are “ absolutely confident ” the new administrator will bring their military , government and civic experience to bear , “ along with your character , on a new chapter of renewed American leadership in space . ”
Bridenstine , with their wife and three children looking on , said they looked forward to implementing President Trump 's national space policy , which calls for ending full government support for the International Space Station in 2025 , continuing development of commercial crew ships and focusing on returning astronauts to the moon and , eventually , Mars .
“ I will do my best to serve our storied agency to the utmost of my abilities as we reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind , ” Bridenstine said . “ NASA represents what is best about the United States of America . We lead , we discover , we pioneer and we inspire . I look forward to our journey together . ”
Ted Cruz , R-Texas , and Kellyanne Conway , counselor to President Trump , joined several dozen reporters and NASA personnel at agency headquarters in Washington for the ceremony .
After Bridenstine was sworn in , the two men took a few moments to chat with three American astronauts aboard the International Space Station , who sent along their “ hearty congratulations ” to the new administrator .
Bridenstine resigned from the House of Representatives earlier Monday . They take over NASA from outgoing acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot , a career NASA engineer-manager who ran the civilian space agency after its previous administrator , former shuttle commander Charles Bolden , retired in the wake of the 2016 presidential election .
A former Navy pilot , Bridenstine majored in economics , psychology and business at Rice University and holds an MBA from Cornell University .
During their Navy career , they accumulated 1,900 hours flying time and 333 carrier landings flying E-2C Hawkeye turboprops and , later , F-18 Hornets before leaving active duty to serve as executive director of the Tulsa Air and Space Museum & Planetarium .
They were elected to represent Oklahoma 's first congressional district in 2012 , serving on the House Armed Services Committee and the Science , Space and Technology Committee . They are the first politician to be named NASA administrator , and their lack of professional space experience and technical education prompted criticism from Democrats .
They also are criticized for strong partisan positions and questioning human contributions to climate change , putting them at odds with many NASA scientists . They were nominated by President Trump to lead the agency last September and was finally confirmed , by a single vote , last Thursday .
Their confirmation was one of the most contentious in NASA history , but Bridenstine thanked their colleagues Monday for their bipartisan support of the space program , saying “ that 's important in space . ”
“ It 's been very bipartisan , ” they said . “ I am excited to continue working with you in this new role . ”

Lonzo Ball got a first-hand look at the movement the Big Baller Brand has become when they showed up to the pop-up shop at Sneaker Pawn in New York City on Sunday . Like LaVar Ball , LiAngelo Ball and LaMelo Ball , the Los Angeles Lakers rookie was greeted upon arrival by a line of rabid Triple B fans that extended a full city block .
Never in their wildest dreams did the Crown Prince of Chino Hills imagine that their family 's clothing line would explode the way it has—though they suspect the Big Baller themselves had a notion .
“ It was just an idea that started at the house in Chino Hills , ” Zo said after Lakers practice at Baruch College on Monday . “ The fact that it 's reached all the way out here and people are going crazy about it , I did n't see it . I 'm sure my dad did . ”

Ball was first taken aback by the power of the BBB when they went to Hawaii with family and friends this past summer .
“ That 's when it kind of opened my eyes , ” they recalled . “ I did n't know it was going to reach all the way to Hawaii until we took that trip out there and everybody knew us and had the gear on and stuff . ”
That experience gave Lonzo some inkling that there might be a big reaction in Manhattan—albeit not as big as the one the Big Ballers actually received .

“ I got out the car , I was like ‘ Wow . It 's cold out here , I would n't stand out there , ' ” Ball said .
But the people of the Big Apple did , cheering and chanting all the while , not as much for Lonzo as for LaVar .
“ Everybody was calling my dad a legend , ” Zo said . “ That was probably the funniest . Just yelling out the brand , saying ‘ LaVar is my hero . ' ”
Lonzo will have an opportunity to strengthen their own cult following in New York City on Tuesday , when they take the floor at Madison Square Garden for the first time against the New York Knicks .
CARSON , Calif. -- Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett sat with a towel over their head during the national anthem on Sunday before their team took on the Los Angeles Chargers in the preseason opener for both teams at the StubHub Center .
Bennett 's action came a day after their former teammate , running back Marshawn Lynch , did something similar before the Oakland Raiders ' exhibition opener on the road against the Arizona Cardinals on Saturday .
`` With everything that 's been going on the last couple of months , and especially after the last couple of days seeing what 's going on in Virginia , and earlier today in Seattle , '' Bennett said after their team 's 48-17 victory . `` I just wanted to be able to use my platform to be able to continuously speak on injustice . ''
Bennett told reporters that they hope their stance will cause others to go out and get involved in changing their community . Bennett said they intend to continue to sit during the national anthem .
`` First of all , I want people to understand that I love the military , '' Bennett said . `` My father 's in the military . I love hot dogs like any other American . I love football like any other American . But I do n't love segregation . I do n't love riots or oppression .
`` I just want to see people have the equality that they deserve . And I want to be able to use this platform to continuously push the message of that . ''
One member of the Seahawks ' front office told ESPN 's Jim Trotter that they are OK with it , `` as long as Michael is preaching love and not hate . ''
Bennett said they spoke to other players around the league about their stance but did not talk to Lynch .
Bennett 's Seahawks teammates and coaches were not aware of their plans . They decided to make a statement on their own because they did n't want to be a distraction to other players or theirs teammates . ?
`` I 'm being vulnerable right now , '' Bennett said . `` There 's a whole bunch of people sitting at home judging me , but they will never get to this point where they can be vulnerable . Let people attack me because they do n't believe what I believe in , but at the end of the day , I 'm being vulnerable to show every person that no matter [ what ] you believe in , keep fighting for it . Keep fighting for equality . Keep fighting for oppressed people . And keep trying to change society . ''
Bennett has been vocal in expressing their opinions on social issues over the past year .
They spent time with Colin Kaepernick during the offseason and wore a T-shirt supporting Kaepernick 's `` Know Your Rights '' campaign during a spring news conference . Bennett was asked earlier this month what it will take for a team to take a shot on Kaepernick .
`` It 's going to take the organization , '' Bennett said . `` I think the players have spoken up enough . I think the media has spoken up . It just takes the ownership for someone to say we want this guy in our locker room . I think a lot of teams , like we said before , were really affected by what they did and what they did this year . It was n't criminal .
`` There 's been guys who have criminal records , guys who have been accused of murder , guys who have been accused of rape and domestic violence who are still in the NFL . It 's crazy to see this guy not have an opportunity in the NFL . It 's just weird . I mean , some quarterbacks , as we all know , should n't be playing , but they are , and this guy is sitting on the side . We all know why . It 's just hard to fathom that he 's not having a job this year . ''

Election 2017 : actually , this is good for all parties by Stephen Tall on April 18 , 2017

Well , who saw that coming ? Not me . But Theresa May 's decision to call a ‘ snap ' election actually suits all parties pretty well .
First , the Tories will win , and will win big . Two recent polls suggest leads over Labour topping 20 % , and that 's before Lynton Crosby gets to work on Jeremy Corbyn 's policies and record . Assuming the Tories win back a chunk of Ukip support , dozens of Labour seats will tumble even if there 's no Labour-to-Tory swing . And there will be a Labour-to-Tory swing . The only real question is whether the Tory majority can be restricted to double-figures .
But there is an upside for Labour : a crushing defeat will at least trigger the ending of Mr Corbyn 's leadership . Who knows who 'll follow them ( Yvette Cooper , Clive Lewis , Keir Starmer ? ) , but they wo n't – just ca n't – be any worse . Labour will recover and have in place , at last , a leader capable of holding Theresa May to account . Which is n't anywhere near as difficult as Mr Corbyn has made it appear .
For the Lib Dems , the timing is pretty much ideal . Anger among Remainers , still very real among a very significant minority of the electorate , has had no electoral outlet . And Tim Farron 's the only leader with a clear position , to reverse Article 50 . The Lib Dems can ( and will ) benefit from Brexit backlash . The party can also hope to get a boost from this May 's local elections . And then there 's the still-to-be-seen impact of the as yet largely unknown-to-the-public Mr Farron in the TV debates ( if , big if , they happen ) .
And of course the SNP can hope/expect to keep most of their MPs , while being able to frighten Scots voters into turning to independence in order to escape Tory rule for the foreseeable .
So , all parties are winners , Mrs May most of all , yes ?
Well , maybe . They will have a bigger majority , an election victory in their own right . And that may be the only metric for measuring success . But elections have a funny habit of throwing up tricky unforseens – David Cameron 's catastrophic downfall was the result of theirs winning outright in 2015 – which is why most leaders avoid them unless forced .
How smart will Mrs May 's decision appear in 2019 if… there 's still no good deal with the EU in sight and British manufacturers and consumers are facing up to the no-longer-hypothetical-but-real economic impact of Brexit… if Labour is once again breathing down the Tories ' necks , led by a sensible , plausible PM-in-waiting… if the Lib Dems have regained a parliamentary toe-hold in former Tory seats… if Scotland has voted for independence and she 's the Prime Minister who ‘ loses the union ' ?
A large part of Theresa May 's popularity has been built on being boringly safe . Voters , tired of the raging arguments unleashed by the referendum , have felt reassured by their stolidity . Today , she 's done something exciting , unpredictable , risky . Let 's see how that lands .

TURIN , Italy ( AP ) — Italy secured a qualifying playoff spot for next year 's World Cup but it was booed off the pitch after drawing with Macedonia 1-1 on Friday .
Defender Giorgio Chiellini gave Italy the lead shortly before halftime but substitute Aleksandar Trajkovski leveled with 13 minutes remaining .
Italy did n't have a shot on target after Chiellini 's goal , against a side ranked outside the top 100 .
Italy remained second in Group G , five points behind Spain , and ca n't be caught heading into the last round of European qualifiers .
Gian Piero Ventura 's side needed just a point from its final two qualifiers against Macedonia and Albania but confidence was low after last month 's 3-0 loss in Spain .
Despite winning only 3-2 in Skopje last year thanks to a stoppage-time goal , Italy was expected to easily sweep away Macedonia in Turin .
However , the Azzuri struggled to carve out opportunities .
Italy finally broke the deadlock five minutes from halftime from an unlikely source . Lorenzo Insigne sent a ball through to in-form forward Ciro Immobile , who rolled it across the six-yard box for Chiellini to tap in .
Chiellini came to the rescue at the other end moments later with a last-ditch tackle after Leonardo Bonucci gave away possession with a terrible pass .
It was more of the same in the second half with Macedonia content to sit back and wait for an opening .
That came in the 77th minute as Trajkovski , who plays for Italian second-division side Palermo , fired a through ball from Goran Pandev into the far side of the net .
Warren Buffett 's company nearly quadrupled its investment in Apple to over 57 million shares during the last three months of last year .
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. filed a quarterly update on its U.S. stock portfolio with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday . Besides the Apple move , Berkshire also revealed a new 8 million share stakes in Monsanto and added to its relatively new airline investments .
Berkshire 's Apple Inc. stake is now worth $ 7.7 billion , up from roughly $ 2 billion the previous quarter . That investment got attention when it was first disclosed last year because Buffett has always been reluctant to invest in technology companies .
Investors like to look at Berkshire 's investments because of Buffett 's remarkably successful track record , although the filing does n't make clear who made all the investments . Berkshire officials do n't generally comment on the filings and did n't respond to questions Tuesday .
Buffett handles the biggest investments in Berkshire 's portfolio , such as Coca-Cola , Wells Fargo and IBM . They have said that investments of less than $ 1 billion are likely to be the work of Ted Weschler or Todd Combs , who each handle about $ 9 billion for Berkshire .
Buffett surprised many people last fall by disclosing new investments in American Airlines , Delta Air Lines , United Continental and Southwest because they had previously advised investors to stay away from the airline sector .
Berkshire added to all of its airline investments . At the end of 2016 , Berkshire held 45.5 million shares of American , 60 million shares of Delta , 43.2 million shares of Southwest and nearly 29 million shares of United Continental .
Berkshire also sold off a significant portion of its Wal-Mart investment and reduced its stake in the retailer to 1.4 million shares from nearly 13 million shares at the end of September .
Besides investments the Omaha , Nebraska-based Berkshire owns more than 90 subsidiaries , including insurance , utility and jewelry firms .
RIO DE JANEIRO ( AP ) — Brazil will play Russia in a friendly in March at the stadium that will host the World Cup final .
The Brazilian football confederation said on Tuesday that the friendly at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow will be on March 23 .
Brazil will face Germany four days later in its last friendly before coach Tite announces their final squad for the World Cup in June .
If Tite 's team finishes top of its group , it will only play at the Luzhniki if it reaches the final .
In November , the stadium was reopened with Argentina beating Russia 1-0 .
Brazil will play in Moscow against Serbia on June 27 in its last match in Group E , but that game will be at the Spartak Arena .

NEW YORK — A crude pipe bomb strapped to a man inspired by the Islamic State group went off Monday in a crowded subway corridor near Times Square , injuring the man , slightly wounding three others and snarling the rush-hour commute for hundreds of thousands of New York workers .
Surveillance cameras captured the man walking casually through the crowded passageway when the bomb suddenly went off at 7:20 a.m. amid a plume of white smoke , which cleared to show the man sprawled on the ground and commuters fleeing in terror . Investigators said it was not clear if the bomb was set off intentionally or went off prematurely .
“ This was an attempted terrorist attack , ” Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters . “ Thank God the perpetrator did not achieve their ultimate goals . ”
The suspect , who was identified as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah , was being treated at a hospital for burns to their hands and abdomen . The others who were injured suffered ringing in the ears and headaches .
Law enforcement officials said Ullah was inspired by the Islamic State group but had apparently not had any direct contact with the group . The officials said they live in Brooklyn and came to the U.S. from Bangladesh about seven years ago on a visa . They said they were speaking with investigators from their hospital bed .
A person briefed on the investigation said Ullah came to the U.S. on an F-4 visa , a preferential visa available for those with family in the U.S. who are citizens or permanent residents , and that they made the bomb in their Brooklyn apartment . They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the blast .
Investigators were searching their apartment , interviewing witnesses and relatives and looking for surveillance footage that may show their movements in the moments before the attack .
The explosion , which happened in an underground passageway under 42nd Street between 7th and 8th avenues , triggered a massive emergency response by police and firefighters both above and below ground , tangling subway and bus service at the nearby Port Authority bus terminal .
Everything around Times Square was shut down , halting what would ordinarily be a bustling rush hour at the “ Crossroads of the World . ”
Authorities said the bomb was a low-tech explosive device attached to the man with Velcro and plastic ties . They were investigating how it was made .
A photo published by the New York Post showed a bearded man crumpled on the ground with their shirt apparently blown off and black soot covering their bare midriff . A police officer was holding the man 's hands behind their back . Another photo shown on cable channel NY1 showed the bearded suspect , wide-eyed , on a stretcher being loaded into an ambulance .
Elrana Peralta , a customer-service worker for Greyhound , said they work in the Port Authority terminal complex near where the blast happened but did not hear the explosion .
“ All we could hear was the chaos , ” they said . “ We could hear people yelling , 'Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! ” '
John Miles , 28 , from Vermont , was waiting for a bus to Massachusetts . They did not hear the blast either , but saw police react .
“ I did n't know what was going on . Officers were running around . I was freaking out , ” they said . There was an announcement that people should take their bags and leave . “ They did n't incite panic . It was fairly orderly . ”
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that President Donald Trump had been briefed on the explosion . Instead of commenting on the suspected terror attack , Trump sent a tweet at 9:17 a.m. criticizing a Sunday story in The New York Times that said they watched cable news television for at least four hours a day .
The blast came just weeks after eight people died in New York when another man , also said to be inspired by the Islamic State , drove a rented truck onto a bike path near the World Trade Center .
Gov . Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference following the attack that New Yorkers should be alert but go about their lives .
“ Let 's go back to work , ” they said . “ ” We 're not going to allow them to disrupt us. “

FOXBOROUGH , Mass . ( AP ) — Two of the New England Patriots ' most important players are getting healthier as they prepare to head to Minneapolis for Super Bowl week .
After getting stitches in their right hand and thumb prior to the AFC championship game last week , quarterback Tom Brady was on the practice field Saturday , gripping the ball without a glove on their throwing hand . Tight end Rob Gronkowski also was at practice , returning to workouts after starting the week in the NFL 's concussion protocol .
Both are positive signs for New England , which has just one practice remaining in Foxborough before the team heads to Minnesota to resume its Super Bowl preparations . Defensive lineman Deatrich Wise , who also missed practice time this week with a concussion , joined Gronk in the team stretching period that is open to reporters .
Gronkowski had n't been on the practice field since their second-quarter exit from the AFC title game following a helmet-to-helmet hit from Jaguars safety Barry Church .
`` It 's always great to have them out there . He 's a great player , a great person , a great teammate and a big part of what we do , '' Brady said of Gronkowski . `` It obviously hurts when he 's not out there for a lot of reasons . But he 's doing the best they can do and we 're all hopeful . ''
While Gronkowski and Wise were on the field , it 's unclear whether they have been officially cleared from the protocol . The team is n't required to file its next injury report until Wednesday .
Gronk played just eight games last season and missed the Patriots ' entire playoff run after undergoing season-ending back surgery .
Since the start of last season , New England is 12-1 without Gronk . But last season it had Martellus Bennett to fill in the gap without him . Bennett signed with Green Bay in the offseason , before being released by the Packers in November . They then re-signed with the Patriots , but only appeared in two games before being placed on season-ending injured reserve .
Brady said they want to spend the rest of the time leading up to the Super Bowl avoiding all possible distractions .
That includes not talking about a new series that debuted on Facebook recently and provides viewers a rare glimpse at their life off the field .
`` What ? Let 's talk about distractions , '' Brady joked when they were asked about the series Saturday . `` We 'll stick to football this week , too . I like that no distractions part . ''
Though this will be Brady 's eighth trip to the Super Bowl , the 40-year-old said they still have an appreciation for what it takes to be playing at this point of the season .
`` I 've never taken anything like this for granted , and I think we 're all very fortunate to be in this game , '' they said . `` Being a part of a couple of these losses , those are pretty tough to swallow , but I think you realize how much effort you have to put in to prepare . It 's a very unique environment , unique game , and you have to be at your best . But in order to do that , you have to prepare as well as you possibly can . ''

PHOENIX , AZ – With only a week to go before Electronic Logging Devices ( ELD ) are mandated in the U.S. , a new survey is showing that almost half of the affected truckers are unprepared .
PrePass , which provides weigh station bypass technologies , surveyed 1,620 drivers , owner-operators , and fleets between November 30 and December 5 . Forty-nine percent said they had yet to select an ELD .
Only 33 % of respondents had installed the devices , while 18 % had the equipment in hand but yet to install it . More than half of those who identified themselves as fleet managers said the equipment was operating , compared to 28 % of drivers and owner-operators .
Of those who had yet to install an ELD , 68 % did n't plan to do it before the deadline , with 26 % said they are not convinced the mandate will actually take effect . Thirty-one percent of that group said they are not planning to install ELD 's at all .
“ It is surprising to see that such a large share of both owner-operators and drivers as well as fleet professionals see no need or rush to comply with the upcoming ELD mandate , ” said Karen Rasmussen , Chief Executive Officer of Help Inc. , which is the company behind PrePass . “ Whether they are in favor of ELD or not , there is every indication that the FMCSA intends to follow through with its plans to require the devices without delay . ”
PrePass supplies ELD 's .
Twenty-four percent of those who responded to the survey said they had not selected a device because of concerns about costs .
Tributes have been paid after the death of a well-known Sunderland pub boss .
Thomas Pulling - known as Tommy - has died aged 86 . They ran the The Sandhills and The Jovial Friar .
Tommy Pulling
Born in Baltic Terrace , Pallion , they went to Pallion Infants School until they were evacuated at the age of eight , alongside older sisters Sadie and Audrey .
“ He thought they were going on a picnic with the school , but instead they got sent to Yorkshire , ” said daughter Sharon Willis .
Billeted on a farm just outside York , Tommy adored it : “ It was lovely where they were - there were no houses around . They loved it , ” said Sharon .
In fact Tommy was so happy that they stayed in Yorkshire after the war and lived there until they were called up at the age of 19 .
They all used to sing ‘ There 's only one Tommy Pulling . ' They were very strict but they ran a good pub . Sharon Willis
They spent four years in the Army , serving in Suez and reaching the rank of sergeant before retuning to Sunderland in 1953 .
Training as a plumber , they went to work at Steels Engineering in 1954 , the same year they met wife-to-be Jane , whose father Robert Nicholas ran The Black Swan in Hylton Road .
The couple were married at Bishopwearmouth Church - now Sunderland Minster - in 1956 .
Tommy became landlord of The Sandhills at Grindon in 1970 and ran the pub for three years , then moved to The Jovial Friar , where they spent the next decade before taking over a pub in Newcastle .

Donald Trump is a “ textbook racist ” whose “ words and behaviours demonstrate considerable prejudicial bias ” , a Duke University professor has claimed .
The President 's “ insensitive , disrespectful and mean-spirited statements and actions ” are consistent with a number of categories of racism including “ insidious ” and “ symbolic ” racism , according to Jay Pearson , an assistant professor at Duke 's Sanford School of Public Policy .
Mr Trump has in the past called racism an “ evil ” and white supremacists “ repugnant ” .
Prof Pearson wrote in the LA Times : “ Throughout last year 's campaign and their first eight months in office , the president has expressed their bias through government orders and the presidential bully pulpit ( systemic racism ) .
“ Trump argued that as a ‘ Mexican , ' US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel , who was born and raised in the United States , could not fairly arbitrate lawsuits related to Trump University ( structural racism ) .
“ For years , Trump protested , falsely , that Barack Obama was not born in the US and was consequently elected illegitimately ( symbolic racism ) . ”
These actions meet scholarly definitions of racist behaviour , they said . Symbolic racism involves rhetoric that delegitimises others , while structural racism assigns social value to people based on inherent differences , they added .
Following their initially equivocal response to the Charlottesville , Virginia riots earlier this year , Mr Trump made explicitly condemned the racism on display when white supremacists took to the streets .
They said : “ Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs , including KKK , neo-Nazis , white supremacists , and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans . ”

More than 10,000 people on Sunday participated in another round of protests against Romanian legislation that critics say would make it harder to punish high-level corruption .
The main protest outside government offices in Bucharest brought out thousands on Sunday and riot police closed roads due to the large numbers . There also were anti-government demonstrations in the cities of Cluj and Iasi . Protesters blew whistles and chanted , `` Justice , not corruption , '' and called for early elections .
Ruxandra Slavoaca , a retired geological engineer who was at the protest in Bucharest with their husband , accused the left-wing ruling coalition of `` making corruption official . '' They added that ordinary people had `` the right to dignity , respect and prosperity . ''
Former Prime Minister Dacian Ciolos and opposition leaders also took part in the protest .
Romania 's Parliament is in the process of approving a series of laws that protesters argue would bring the justice system under greater political control .
U.S . Ambassador Hans G. Klemm said Sunday that if Parliament backtracked from current anti-corruption laws , Romania could be at risk of Russia seeking to undermine the country 's stability . Romania , a European Union member , has cool relations with Russia .
Thousands of Romanian magistrates , the European Commission and President Klaus Iohannis have criticized the proposals .
A number of senior politicians from the ruling coalition are facing corruption-related charges from probes they claim are politically motivated .
LAKELAND , Fla. ( AP ) — A Florida man is suing their friend for misleading them about the value of their $ 1 million lottery ticket , and for pocketing the proceeds after helping them cash it in .
The Lakeland Ledger ( http : //bit.ly/2ssuIs8 ) reports 45-year-old John Rhoades asked their 28-year-old friend Tyler Scott for help after realizing the scratch-off ticket they bought in April was a winner . Rhoades says they did n't know how much the ticket was worth or how to cash it in .
The lawsuit says Scott told Rhoades it was worth $ 100,000 . Attorneys for Scott say they gave Rhoades the money to buy the ticket , and that Scott scratched the ticket and won , later giving their friend $ 64,000 .
A judge issued an order freezing both men 's bank accounts until ownership of the winning ticket can be determined .
TOKYO — US Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese leaders began talks Tuesday expected to focus largely on trade with America 's anchor ally in the region , though tensions with North Korea loomed large .
Pence reassured Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the US considers its alliance with Japan to be a cornerstone of security in the region .
“ We appreciate the challenging times in which the people of Japan live with increasing provocations from across the Sea of Japan , ” Pence said .

“ We are with you 100 percent , ” they said , adding that the US “ always seeks peace . ”
Pence reiterated that after years of North Korea testing the US and its neighbors in East Asia with its nuclear ambitions , the US “ era of strategic patience is over . ”
Abe said Japan likewise hopes for peaceful dialogue with Pyongyang , “ but at the same time , dialogue for the sake of dialogue is valueless. ” Pressure on North Korea is crucial , they said .
Pence is on a 10-day Asia trip that will also take them to Indonesia and Australia .
Concluding a visit to South Korea that was mostly focused on the North Korea problem , Pence told business leaders in Seoul earlier Tuesday that the administration is taking a fresh look at trade agreements as part of its “ America First ” policy .
“ We 're reviewing all of our trade agreements across the world to ensure that they benefit our economy as much as they benefit our trading partners , ” Pence told the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea .
White House officials said the economic meetings in Tokyo , with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso and other officials , will help forge a framework for a new US-Japan economic dialogue launched by President Donald Trump and Abe during the Japanese leader 's visit to the US in February .
Pence 's two main goals are to spur increased US access to Japanese markets and strengthen Japanese foreign investment , they said .

While Japan 's trade surplus with the US is much smaller than China 's , Trump has decried the imbalance , especially in auto exports .
Both sides said they do not expect the talks in Tokyo this week to delve into sector-by-sector talks on trade . With no US trade representative yet in office and other key negotiator positions still unfilled , such nitty-gritty discussions will have to come later .
But the meetings could indicate how forcefully the US will pressure Japan to further open its farm and automotive sectors .
Pence 's advisers said the vice president would make the case to Abe and Aso that the US rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , or TPP , under Trump does not signal a US withdrawal from trade and economic development in the region .
The loss of US participation in the TPP was a blow to Japan following strenuous negotiations , especially over opening access wider to its long-protected farm sector .
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters over the weekend that Japan might push ahead with a revised , 11-nation version of the TPP despite the U.S. rejection of the trade accord .
For now , both sides seem keen to downplay potential for conflict .
“ My understanding is that our talks are premised not on friction but on cooperation , ” Aso told reporters before Pence 's arrival .
US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , who met with Japan 's trade minister , Hiroshige Seko earlier Tuesday , said they hope to soon begin talks on a free trade agreement with Japan .
As Indiana governor , Pence saw firsthand the impact of Japanese automakers Toyota , Honda and Subaru , whose factories employ thousands of people in their home state .

FAYETTEVILLE , Ark . -- Frank Broyles , who guided Arkansas to its lone national football championship and later molded the overall program as athletic director , died Monday at the age of 92 .
Broyles died from complications of Alzheimer 's disease , according to a statement from their family , who said they `` passed peacefully in their home surrounded by their loved ones . ''
Broyles won almost 71 percent of their games in 19 years as Razorbacks football coach . They became the school 's athletic director in 1974 while still coaching , eventually retiring from the gridiron to focus on administrative duties after the 1976 season .
As athletic director , Broyles led an overhaul and upgrade of Arkansas ' facilities -- as well as leading the school in its move to the SEC . Following their coaching career , Broyles , who earned a spot in the National Football Foundation 's College Hall of Fame , served as an analyst on ABC 's college football telecasts from 1977 to 1985 .
While their coaching record of 144-48-5 at Arkansas defined the first part of their career , Broyles ' legacy is every bit equaled by their work as athletic director .
Arkansas ' athletic facilities underwent a near-complete overhaul following the school 's move from the Southwest Conference to the SEC in 1991 .
Broyles spearheaded the fundraising efforts that led to the construction of Bud Walton Arena , the renovation of and additions to Razorback Stadium and the building of Baum Stadium . They also guided the school as it built indoor and outdoor tracks , a tennis facility and the athletic administrative complex that bears their name .
They were known for their ability to identify top coaches , both head coaches and assistants .
Broyles was responsible for hiring basketball coaches Eddie Sutton and Nolan Richardson as well as Lou Holtz and Ken Hatfield in football . They also hired former great John McDonnell in track .
McDonnell won 40 national championships with the Razorbacks , while Richardson led Arkansas to the 1994 national championship in men 's basketball .
Broyles retired as athletic director in 2007 , moving into a fundraising role with the school 's Razorback Foundation until leaving that role in 2014 .
`` For the past 56 years , I have had the privilege or working in the only job I ever wanted -- to be the head football coach and then the athletic director of the Razorbacks , '' Broyles said at the time . `` The Razorbacks have always been my passion . ''
They spent much of their time later in life attending various Arkansas sporting events and raising money for Alzheimer 's awareness after the 2004 death of their wife , Barbara , following a battle with the disease .
Broyles started the Frank and Barbara Broyles Foundation CareGivers United , an Alzheimer 's education organization , and wrote a book that published more than 800,000 copies and focused on helping those who care for loved ones with Alzheimer 's .
`` In 50 years , people are going to look back and that 's what they are going to remember them for , their second legacy , '' said Broyles ' daughter , Betsy Arnold .
Under Broyles as coach , the Razorbacks won or shared seven Southwest Conference titles and went to 10 bowl games .
That included a win over Nebraska in the Cotton Bowl following the 1964 regular season , which left the Razorbacks 11-0 . Alabama was also undefeated entering the bowl season and was named the national champion by The Associated Press poll , but the Crimson Tide lost their bowl game to Texas -- leading to Arkansas being named the champion by the Football Writers Association of America .
The AP poll soon changed its policy and began naming its champion following the bowl games .
Several prominent football figures were members of the undefeated 1964 football team , including Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones , former Miami Hurricanes and Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson and Hatfield .
`` He 's a life teacher , '' Jones told the AP in 2014 . `` He always spoke about football as it related to life . ... All things pointed to life 's lessons . ''
One of Broyles ' first moves as athletic director was the hiring of Sutton , the coaching great who took over a struggling basketball program and turned it into a national power .
Following Sutton 's departure , Broyles again struck coaching gold with the hiring of Richardson -- though the two strong personalities clashed when Richardson was fired in 2002 and claimed they were a victim of racial discrimination , a lawsuit that was eventually ruled without merit .
At Decatur , Georgia , Broyles was a star in football , basketball and baseball . They won 10 letters in those sports at Georgia Tech and was the All-SEC quarterback in 1944 and 1946 .
They graduated from Georgia Tech in 1947 with an industrial management degree . Broyles was drafted in the third round by the Chicago Bears but turned down professional football and baseball offers before accepting a position on Bob Woodruff 's staff at Baylor .
After a year as an assistant at Florida , Broyles returned to Georgia Tech as the offensive backfield coach and the Yellow Jackets won 31 straight .
In 1957 , Broyles was hired as head coach at Missouri and guided the Tigers to a 5-4-1 record . The following January , Arkansas athletic director John Barnhill offered Broyles the Arkansas job vacated by Jack Mitchell .
Broyles ' first team started 0-6 and finished 4-6 . Only one other time did the Razorbacks finish below .500 under Broyles .
A couple dozen of Broyles ' players or assistants became head coaches , leading to the creation of the annual Broyles Award -- given to the nation 's top assistant coach -- in their honor .
Broyles had four sons and two daughters with their first wife , Barbara , and later married Gen Whitehead in late 2005 .
`` I will forever be grateful for the generosity , graciousness and unwavering support they extended to me when I came to the University of Arkansas , '' Arkansas athletic director Jeff Long said . `` The thoughts and prayers of the entire Razorback nation are with their wife , Gen , their children and the entire Broyles family . ''

TAIPEI ( Taiwan News ) – During the recent meeting between fishery agencies of Japan and Taiwan , several revisions were made to a 2013 bilateral agreement concerning fishing rights around the disputed Diaoyu Islands ( Jp . Senkaku Islands ) .
New rules for permitted fishing methods have been agreed to by both countries for particular sections of the mutually shared fishery . According to Japan News , one section will only permit a method proposed by Taiwan , while the neighboring section will only permit a method proposed by Japan .
The new regulations will go into effect in April , and there will be a trial period until July , during which time vessels and their methods will be observed and catches analyzed .
The new agreements govern fishing around one triangular zone situated around the Diaoyu Islands , and along the Yaeyama Islands at the southern edge of the Ryukyu Island Chain . The zone is open for fishing by each state provided each government regulates the number of ships and catches in the area , according to the bilateral pact , reports the Diplomat .

Japan News notes that under the previous arrangement , Japanese vessels were permitted use of the entire zone from early morning to afternoon , and Taiwanese vessels were allowed to fish from late night to dawn .
However , the direction of trailing lines , and the arrangement of fishing fleets were reported to create problems and imbalances in catches between Japanese and Taiwanese fleets .
Under the new arrangement , the zone will essentially be subdivided into Japanese and Taiwanese subsections , but based only on a preference for fishing method . Both countries will retain access to the entire fishery zone , but will be expected to adhere to the regulatory expectation regarding fishing time and the method prescribed for each subsection .

Two people in England have been confirmed to have been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok , the same chemical weapon that was used against an ex-Russian spy earlier this year .
British police at Scotland Yard confirmed that the mysterious agent that appears to have caused a couple in their 40s to become critically ill was Novichuk .
The couple collapsed at a residence four days ago , The Associated Press reported . The couple were found collapsed eight miles from where the former Russian spy and their daughter were found after being exposed to the same agent four months ago , the AP reported .
Police first thought the couple , identified by friends to the AP as 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley , 45 , were suffering as a result of using contaminated heroin or crack cocaine .
Neil Basu , the assistant commissioner for specialist operations which handles counterterrorism operations in the U.K. , said that the latest victims are both British nationals and are local to the area .

An ambulance was called to a residence in Amesbury following the woman collapsed shortly after 10 a.m. Saturday morning , and another ambulance was called that afternoon in response to the collapse of the man .
The initial assessment by doctors suggested they had fallen ill from contaminated drugs but on Monday , `` due to concerns over the symptoms the man and woman were displaying , '' samples from the patients were sent to a different laboratory for further study , Basu said in a statement . That further analysis led to the conclusion that the couple had been contaminated with the same nerve agent that was used in the earlier attack .
The couple is in critical condition and are being treated in a hospital .
Investigators concluded that they were exposed to the same type of nerve agent as the former spy and their daughter , but they are unsure if it was from the same batch .

They said that there is no evidence that the latest individuals were targeted in any way , noting that there is nothing in their background to suggest that they would be targeted . The object that contaminated them has not yet been identified , Basu said .
Back in March , Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed that former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and their daughter Yulia were exposed to Novichuk .
Sergei Skripal was unconscious for a month after the attack and their daughter Yulia was unconscious for three weeks .
Basu said that there is no evidence that the new victims visited areas that had been decontaminated in the wake of the Skripal case . Several areas where the latest victims may have been leading up to their collapse have been cordoned off as a precaution .
England 's chief medical officer Professor Sally Davies said that the risk of contamination to the general public remains low but anyone who may have visited any area that is now cordoned off between now and Friday evening should take precautions to was their clothes and wipe down shoes and bags . They also warned the public to be careful picking up any unknown items .
Novichok — which means `` newcomer '' in Russian — is the codename for a series of nerve agents that Russia allegedly secretly developed in the latter stages of the Cold War . Novichok nerve agents were intended to be more powerful and harder to detect than previous generations of nerve agents .
Russia has never officially acknowledged the existence of the Novichok program and most of what is publicly known about it comes from Vil Mirzayanov , a Russian scientist who worked for years in the Soviet chemical weapons program .
Nearly two weeks ago , Prince Charles and their wife Camilla visited the town of Salisbury , where the Skripals were poisoned , to show their support for the town 's recovery .

Rizzo 's slide overshadows Chicago 's 7-0 win over Pirates Chicago Cubs relief pitcher Mike Montgomery delivers in the second inning of a baseball game against the Pittsburgh Pirates in Pittsburgh , Monday , May 28 , 2018 . ( AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar )
PITTSBURGH ( AP ) -- Anthony Rizzo 's seventh home run of the season gave the sleep-deprived Chicago Cubs an early lead on Monday afternoon . Their two-run single in the ninth put the finishing touches on a 7-0 romp over the Pittsburgh Pirates .
It 's what happened in between that could have a carry-over effect for the NL Central rivals .
Rizzo slid hard into Pittsburgh catcher Elias Diaz while being forced out at home in the eighth inning , taking out Diaz 's legs , forcing a wild throw into right field . That allowed two runs to score and left both sides wondering what does - and does n't - constitute a legal slide in modern-day Major League Baseball .
Rizzo claimed they `` was n't trying to hurt anyone '' when they went leg-first into Diaz , who had already touched home plate for the force out and was a full step in front of the base when the 6-foot-3 , 240-pound Rizzo undercut him .
'' Plays like that are scary , but at the same time , you have to play hard , '' Rizzo said . '' It 's 100 percent in the rules . ''
Cubs manager Joe Maddon agreed , calling it a `` perfect play '' while chastising officials for not doing a proper job educating fans on the rules .
'' The fans ' reaction to ( Rizzo ) the next time they came up indicates that they think they did something wrong , '' Maddon said . '' And that 's what 's so wrong about all of that . Different plays where the player has not done anything wrong , but because of new rules , it makes them wear the black hat for the moment . ''
The Pirates challenged the call , but it stood on review , a sequence that ended with Pirates manager Clint Hurdle getting ejected when they came out to argue the decision .
'' Our catcher , they make the play just like he 's supposed to make and they get wiped out with a hard baseball slide , '' Hurdle said . '' There 's potential injury and I do n't see the rule fitting the means there . If it 's open season , it 's open season . Everybody is going to see the play and knows this is a play you can make on every catcher in their most vulnerable position . He 's completely exposed . ''
Story Continues
Diaz remained in the game after being tended to by trainers and said Rizzo apologized before their at-bat in the ninth inning .
'' When I saw the replay , I was like 'Man , this guy could have ended my career right here , '' ' Diaz said . '' I understand they called it a legal slide , but out of what I 've been trained and what I 've been told , that was not a legal slide . ''
Diaz , starting for the second straight day while Francisco Cervelli dealt with flu-like symptoms , acknowledged they were in some pain but was never close to being removed as a precaution .
'' For me to come out of that game , they needed to break my leg , '' Diaz said .
MONTGOMERY SHINES
The play overshadowed a dominant performance by spot starter Mike Montgomery . Filling in for injured Yu Darvish , Montgomery ( 1-1 ) retired the first 13 batters and allowed only a pair of singles over 5 2/3 innings , striking out five without a walk .
The Cubs arrived in Pittsburgh at 4 a.m. local time following a victory over San Francisco in Chicago on Sunday night . Maddon wondered openly before the first pitch why the start time was n't pushed until later in the day , but the well-rested Montgomery , who has worked exclusively in the bullpen this season , was more than ready to go .
'' Obviously , last night with the travel , the bullpen needed as much help as they could get , '' Montgomery said . '' I know that . I was kind of doing it for those guys . Give those guys some rest . ''
Pittsburgh managed to get the ball out of the infield five times with Montgomery on the mound , four harmless fly outs and a single by Corey Dickerson with one out in the fifth . Then David Freese hit into a double play .
Chad Kuhl ( 4-3 ) gave up only Rizzo 's solo shot to right field in the first , but fell to 1-5 against the Cubs . Addison Russell 's pinch-hit two-run home run off reliever Steven Brault in the seventh gave Chicago a 3-0 lead as the Cubs poured it on late . The Pirates fell to 2-8 in their last 10 games .
'' Offensively we 've missed some opportunities , '' Hurdle said . '' Not a lot of opportunities today . But we 've had a lot of opportunities in the other games . So we continue to create opportunities . We 're just not finishing off things . ''
COMING AND GOING
The Cubs recalled RHP Luke Farrell from Triple-A Iowa and optioned Justin Hancock to the minors . Pittsburgh released reliever George Kontos after going 2-3 with a 5.03 ERA in 21 appearances .
TEMPERS FLARE
Freese and Pirates third base coach Joey Cora had to be separated in the dugout late in the game . Hurdle said they are n't aware of the confrontation , but that the team would take care of it `` in house . ''
TRAINER 'S ROOM
Cubs : Utility player Ian Happ pinch hit in the seventh inning , their first appearance since exiting Saturday 's loss to San Francisco with right shoulder soreness after making a diving stop .
Pirates : They shut down closer Felipe Vazquez for the day as a precaution . Vazquez complained of discomfort in their left forearm after blowing a third consecutive save opportunity in a loss to St. Louis on Sunday . Director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk said tests done after the game did not find any structural damage .
UP NEXT
Cubs : Jon Lester ( 4-2 , 2.37 ERA ) will make their 14th career start against the Pirates . Lester is 5-5 with a 3.50 ERA when facing Pittsburgh .
Pirates : Rookie Nick Kingham ( 2-1 , 3.44 ERA ) will make their fourth career start on Tuesday . Kingham is filling in for Ivan Nova , who was placed on the 10-day disabled list Monday with a sprained ring finger on their right ( throwing ) hand .

VATICAN CITY ( AP ) — Pope Francis has insisted that indigenous peoples must give prior consent for any economic activity on their ancestral lands — an indirect critique as the Donald Trump administration seeks to advance construction on a $ 3.8 billion oil pipeline over opposition from American Indians .
Francis met Wednesday with representatives of indigenous peoples attending a U.N. agricultural meeting in Rome . They said the key issue facing them is how to reconcile the right to development with protection of their cultures and territories .
They said `` the right to prior and informed consent '' should always prevail especially `` when planning economic activities which may interfere with indigenous cultures and their ancestral relationship to the Earth . ''

European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the issues of Jerusalem as Israel 's capital and the chances of reinvigorating negotiations on the peace process .
Mogherini has joined many EU leaders in expressing disapproval of the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel 's capital . They said during a joint media address Monday that `` the only realistic solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine is based on two states with Jerusalem as the capital of both . ''
Netanyahu insisted that what U.S. President Donald Trump did was `` put facts squarely on the table . Peace is based on reality . ''
They said the reality of seeing Jerusalem as Israel 's capital `` does n't obviate peace , it makes peace possible . ''
LONDON — A London museum has revealed that the remains of five archbishops of Canterbury were discovered inside a secret tomb beneath its building .
The Garden Museum posted a statement and video Sunday revealing the find , which was made more than a year ago .
The museum sits on a site that used to house the former St. Mary-at-Lambeth Church and is located next to Lambeth Palace , the archbishop of Canterbury 's London residence .
The remains were found while builders were renovating the building . They lifted some slabs to reveal a hidden crypt .
Garden Museum director Christopher Woodward says five archbishops were buried in the tomb , including Richard Bancroft .
Bancroft became archbishop in 1604 and played a major role in production of the King James Bible .
The remains of the others have not been identified .

Both are in search of civilian jobs in the highly competitive tech industry . They and 23 others are wrapping up a 10-day program run by BreakLine , an educational program sponsored by a who 's who of Silicon Valley companies in search of bright candidates.The focus today was artificial intelligence and drones . Both specialties are creating jobs as a result of automation and robotics . The group was visiting Kespry , a Menlo Park drone company that has hired six veterans from the BreakLine program with service in the Army , Marines and Navy . Its drones operate autonomously for specialized applications in the mining , construction and insurance industries.Garrett Smith , a former Marine intelligence officer , demonstrated one of the Kespry drones to the BreakLine veterans on this sunny Tuesday .

Activists burned U.S. and Israeli flags in front of the American embassy in Jakarta on Monday in a fourth day of protests in Indonesia against President Donald Trump 's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel 's capital .
Several hundred protesters from an Islamic youth group rallied outside the embassy , burning flags and images of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu .
Wearing white robes , the protesters unfurled banners reading `` U.S. Embassy , Get Out from Al-Quds '' and `` We are with the Palestinians . '' Al-Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem , the historic Middle East city that is a holy site for Jews , Christians and Muslims .
A weekend protest at the embassy attracted several thousand people and similar protests have been held in other cities around Indonesia , the world 's most populous Muslim nation .
Indonesian President Joko `` Jokowi '' Widodo has strongly condemned Trump 's move , which they described as a violation of U.N. resolutions .
Indonesia does not have diplomatic ties with Israel and has long been a strong supporter of Palestinian aspirations for statehood .
Trump 's announcement Wednesday overturned decades of U.S. policy , and a longstanding international consensus , that the fate of Jerusalem be decided as a part of a peace deal between Israel and Palestine .
Israeli and Palestinian claims to the city 's eastern sector form the core of their conflict , and Trump 's announcement was seen as siding with the Israelis .

MANILA , Philippines ( AP ) — A Philippine army commander says government forces have foiled an attempt by a few dozen Muslim militants aligned with the Islamic State group to attack a small southern town in fighting that left four gunmen dead .
Army Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc says troops clashed with 30 to 40 militants Tuesday and drove them away from the small farming community of Mopac where they planned to launch an attack on the town hall of Datu Paglas town about a half kilometer ( quarter mile ) away .
Cabunoc said Wednesday the militants from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters led by Solaiman Tudon occupied several abandoned houses in Mopac , where they used to live , over the weekend but their family and other villagers asked the gunmen to leave .
Troops later clashed with the militants .
Two police officers are in hot water after a Korean-American earlier arrested for selling party drugs was able escape from their custody by simply walking out of a Quezon City hospital on Black Saturday , a few days after their surgery .
SPO2 Michael Macarubbo was out having breakfast while PO1 Ernie Eugenio fell asleep , allowing the suspect , who was not handcuffed to their hospital bed , to just leave , a ranking official said on Monday .
Macarubbo and Eugenio are now facing charges for evasion through negligence over the escape of drug suspect Jun No , according to the spokesperson of the Philippine National Police-Drug Enforcement Group ( PNP-DEG ) .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Quezon City Prosecutors Office found probable cause to charge Macarubbo and Eugenio and recommended bail at P6,000 each . They were also slapped with an administrative complaint for serious neglect of duty .
Meanwhile , a woman who allegedly gave No money hours before the escape was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice .
No , who used the alias Jazz , gave their guards the slip at East Avenue Medical Center ( EAMC ) , where they had undergone surgery for acute appendicitis , Supt . Enrico Rigor of the PNP-DEG said in a press briefing at Camp Crame .
Deep regret
“ This group would like to announce , with deep regret , that Jun No , the American citizen of Korean descent… escaped from hospital detention , ” Rigor said . “ The guards did n't handcuff them to the bed… Before the deployment , there was a briefing by DEG and it was very clear that No should be handcuffed at all times to their hospital bed . ”
Macarubbo reports to the PNP-DEG while Eugenio is under the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency ( PDEA ) .
Busted in Pasay
Rigor said Macarubbo was out having breakfast while Eugenio was asleep right next to the suspect when No escaped .
No was arrested in a sting operation on April 5 when they allegedly sold 140 ecstasy tablets on Seaside Boulevard at the Mall of Asia Complex in Pasay City .
Around noon on April 10 , No complained of lower abdominal pain during a medical exam that was required before their transfer to the PDEA Quezon City Jail Annex in Bicutan , Taguig City . They were brought to the PNP General Hospital , where the attending physician determined that they were suffering from acute appendicitis and that they needed a medical operation .

No underwent surgery at EAMC around 9:30 p.m. on April 10 , where they remained confined after the procedure .
Pinay visitor
The PNP said a 24-year-old Filipino woman identified as Darleen Son , alias Soeyang , arrived to see No the night before the escape and gave them P3,000 .
The suspect was believed to have used the money to get a ride after leaving the hospital around 6:10 a.m. on Saturday .
Rigor said Son , who spent the night at the hospital , apparently did not know of No 's plan to escape and stayed behind even after the suspect had fled .
EAMC personnel prevented them from leaving after they learned of No 's escape . “ They detained them and our investigators were able to arrest them when they arrived , ” Rigor said .
The city prosecutor 's office found probable cause to charge Son for coddling a drug lord and set their bail at P200,000 , Rigor added .
A security camera footage at EAMC showed No walking out of the hospital unaccompanied .
“ He still needs antibiotics ( and ) ca n't eat solid food , ” the official noted .
No was earlier based in Cebu before they moved to Manila , where they continued to be a major supplier of illegal drugs in the Malate area , the police said .
RALEIGH , N.C. ( AP ) — Jurors in North Carolina are getting a round-up of testimony in a lawsuit filed by more than 500 neighbors of an industrial-scale swine operation .
The plaintiffs contend that open-air cesspools inflict them with intense , putrid smells that ca n't be removed from clothing or household fabrics for years .
Lawyers for Virginia-based Smithfield Foods maintain that the smells , traffic and noise do n't hurt the neighbors ' ability to enjoy their own property .
The jury has heard three weeks of testimony . This is the first of a series of test cases against the low-cost , high-volume methods of hog-production division used by the Chinese-owned company .
Lawyers for the neighbors say alternative methods do n't cause such a nuisance , but the company uses open-air cesspools because they 're cheap .
MOGADISHU , Somalia ( AP ) — Fighting continued through the night as Somalia 's al-Shabab Islamic extremists fought off heavily armed soldiers in a bloody siege at a popular Mogadishu restaurant .
Extremist snipers fired on security troops who surrounded the restaurant building and used big guns mounted on the backs of vehicles to neutralize militants . Soldiers entered the ground floor while the insurgent attackers held positions upstairs .
Senior Somali police office Capt . Mohamed Hussein said at dawn Thursday that at least one attacker was firing on troops from inside the restaurant .
The roofs were blown off the Pizza House restaurant and nearby buildings from the powerful blasts .
High casualties are feared in the attack on the busy restaurant . Police said the bodies of five girls thought to have been killed by militants were found in the restaurant .

Offset Thanks Man for Saving Their Lives After Car Crash With New Whip
Offset is lucky to be alive following their car accident earlier this month .
It was reported that the Atlanta rapper totaled their green Dodge Challenger after swerving to avoid hitting a crackhead in the street . The cause of the accident was revealed by their soon-to-be wife , Cardi B , in a since deleted tweet . Apparently there was a Good Samaritan walking to work who helped Offset after the accident .
Jamar was walking to work when they saw the Migos member climbing out of their car . Now they do n't have to worry about walking to or from work again because Offset copped them a new Nissan Altima .
It 's unclear what Jamar did to aid him , but they helped the “ Ric Flare Drip ” rapper get to their destination .

The original Apple Watch was launched on April 24 , 2015 and rose to the top of the wearables market , with 4.2 million units selling in 2015Q2 . After newer models came out in subsequent years , it was renamed the Apple Watch Series 0 .
[ How to Compare Apple Watches to Get The Best Model For You ]
Original Apple Watch
Kevin Lynch , vice president of technology at Apple , was hired to work on the Apple Watch :
People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much . People want that level of engagement . But how do we provide it in a way that 's a little more human , a little more in the moment when you 're with somebody ?
It was n't until Wired published an article called iPhone Killer : The Secret History of the Apple Watch that we got some insight into the development of the Watch . As soon as Mr. Lynch was hired , they were immediately set to work on creating a wearable computing experience completely different than iOS and the iPhone .
For example , the technology on the Watch that provides message replies so you can text quickly started as a “ robot ” called Quickboard . “ We were like , OK , you do n't really need to see another confirmation screen and press another button to send the thing . You 're in the moment ; just send it . ”
The whole article is a fascinating read , and I recommend it . It 's great to see how the Apple Watch started , and how far it has come .

Myanmar 's government has vowed to take action against police officers shown beating villagers in a video that has circulated on the internet .
Monday 's front-page story in the state-owned Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper about the Nov. 5 incident was a rare official acknowledgment of abuses taking place in the western state of Rakhine . The authorities have been conducting counterinsurgency operations there since an attack in October by unidentified armed men killed nine border guards .
Human rights groups accuse security forces of abuses against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine , including rape , killings and the burning of more than 1,000 homes .
Monday 's story , which cited the office of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and police , did not say what punishment the police might face .
Although Oracle has been mostly quiet lately about the progress of its enterprise Java overhaul , that is likely to change soon with the impending arrival of Java Platform , Enterprise Edition 8 , better known as Java EE 8 .
The upgrade retools enterprise Java for cloud and microservices environments . A vote on the Java Community Process specification for Java EE 8 is under way and is due to be completed on August 21 . Java EE 8 , the official specification states , is about simplification while extending the range of the platform to accommodate emerging technologies in the cloud and web . The specification also emphasizes HTML5 and HTTP/2 support .
Java EE 8 will support a multitude of Java technology specifications , including :
JSON-B ( JavaScript Object Notation Binding ) , providing a binding layer for converting Java objects to and from JSON messages .
Updates to JSON-P ( JSON Processing API ) , improving the object model .
JAX-RS ( Java API for RESTful Web Services ) 2.1 reactive client API .
JAX-RS support for server-sent events , offering a one-way channel from a server to a client .
HTTP/2 support in Servlet . Java Servlet provides a programming class to extend server capabilities .
Java EE Security API , accommodating cloud and PaaS paradigms .
Bean Validation 2.0 , leveraging Java 8 language constructs for use in validation . Bean Validation enables expression of constraints on object models using annotations .
JavaServer Faces 2.3 , for building server-side user interfaces .
CDI ( Contexts and Dependency Injection ) 2.0 , emphasizing asynchronous events .
Java EE upgrades to come faster
Java EE 8 will be followed next year by Java EE 9 , as part of a two-phase effort to retool the platform for modern-day cloud and microservices deployments . Java EE 8 is centered on accommodations to configure services and on health-checking to manage services . The follow-up EE 9 release is slated to promote deployment of smaller units of services and a reactive programming model for building large-scale , event-based systems .
Built on top of Java SE ( Standard Edition ) , Java EE offers an API and runtime environment for building and running large-scale , multitiered network applications , with security and reliability serving as key goals of the platform . The last major release , Java EE 7 , became available in June 2013 and focused on HTML5 and mobility .
As part of its Java EE 8 development process , Oracle has been working on GlassFish 5 , the open source application server that has served as a reference implementation for the Java EE platform . The intent is to have two GlassFish 5 promotion builds weekly to catch integration issues sooner .
Java SE is also set for an upgrade , with version 9 due on September 21 after multiple delays .
Java EE rebellion results in MicroProfile support
Last year , prominent members of the enterprise Java community rose up to protest what was perceived as stalled progress on Java EE . Oracle then rolled out its plan to revitalize the platform , noting the company had desired to retreat from earlier Java EE plans It deemed inadequate for modern computing paradigms .
One of the rebel efforts led to the development of MicroProfile , providing a baseline platform definition for microservices . The Eclipse Foundation has since taken over MicroProfile , which will still be promoted as a mechanism to accelerate adoption of Java EE 8 . The current 1.1 version of MicroProfile provides a stack that includes CDI , JSON , JAX-RS , and a configuration API .
Ms. Pac-Man was supposed to be the more difficult arcade game . But now it 's been laid low — like chess , Go , and poker before it — by artificial intelligence .
Researchers with deep learning company Maluuba , which Microsoft acquired earlier this year , decided to tackle the deceptively simple arcade game after developing an unusual AI algorithm that uses a team of intelligent agents overseen by a manager agent to play Ms. Pac-Man . Those agents broke the game down into tasks and sub-tasks and were rewarded ( or reinforced ) for pursuing those tasks .
For example , some agents were charged with finding specific Ms. Pac-Man game pellets , while others were told to avoid ghosts at all costs . The manager agent would then analyze how the agents approached each task and the intensity they applied to them to decide which paths were , in fact , the best . Individual agents had their own reward functions and the manager would prioritize tasks that were more important . In other words , tasks like avoiding ghosts ( which kill on touch in the game ) were prioritized over other tasks .
Using this method , the AI algorithm soon mastered Ms. Pac-Man and reached a maximum score of 999,999 , which , according to Microsoft , no AI or human has ever achieved before . Doing so , automatically resets the game .
Maluuba researcher Harm van Seijen , who also authored a paper on the AI research ( which is being submitted to Cornell University on Wednesday ) , told me that they designed their AI based on how the iPhone is made . `` It 's not a single person that makes it , '' they told me , adding , `` It 's really inspired by how humans cooperate to do these really great things , like to build really great products . ''
The team spent months working on the algorithms , but only applied them to Ms. Pac-Man in the last two months .
In all , there were approximately 150 intelligent agents all working in parallel on Ms. Pac-Man . To continuously play the game inside a computer , the team needed three pieces of code : the game , a routine to send actions to the game , and the learning method .
The goal of this research , van Seijen said , was never to beat the game — it was `` to solve learning and behavior. ” So , completing Ms. Pac-Man came as a surprise .
`` It was pretty exciting , but also kind of letdown at same point , '' Maluuba product manager Rahul Mehrotra .
After running the algorithms overnight on the game the researchers noticed some anomalies in the data , Mehrotra recalled . To understand why the scores did n't simply keep rising , the team sat and watched the AI play the game .
`` As we approached this million mark point , we started to get excited . So as soon as we got to 999,990 the game resets to zero . We were like , 'Oh , you ca n't score more than that . ' We wanted to keep going forward , '' said Mehrotra .
According to Microsoft 's blog post on the breakthrough , Steve Golson , one of the co-creators of the arcade version of the game , said that that the deceptively simple Ms. Pac-Man , 1980s sequel to the wildly popular Pac-Man arcade game , was intentionally designed to have less predictability than Pac-Man .
“ You want [ players to think ] , ‘ Oh , oh , I almost got it ! I 'm going to try again , ' ” Golson said . “ Ka-ching ! Another quarter , ” they said in the blog post .
Later , I caught up with Golson via Twitter DM and asked them about the score limit and their creation being beaten by an AI :
Games , van Seijen said , have been traditionally very popular among AI researchers for testing algorithms and Ms. Pac-Man has already received a lot of attention in AI community . `` It 's actually a very hard game to solve , '' they explained .
Seemingly random systems are catnip for researchers trying to test and develop ever-more powerful versions of AI . When there are countless options and no obvious pattern to the choices a system makes , basic computer systems can struggle to conquer them .
The divide and conquer approach the Maluuba researchers took , however , proved too much for Ms. Pac-Man , and allowed researchers to complete the game . And though they believe it may have applications that go far beyond the arcade , no one was willing to predict exactly when task-based AIs would appear in more complex scenarios .
`` This is still a very controlled setting . Pac-Man is very compact and still does n't represent complexity of real-world situations , '' said Mehrotra .

Halfway into watching the # FutureWorld trailer , I realised that I had developed an expression akin to having just smelled a terrible , terrible fart . Awful . Just awful . # jamesfranco # movies # garbage — Jimmy LaRue ( @ GonnaWinAnOscar ) April 15 , 2018
Ouch . Tough crowd .
Co-directed by Franco and Bruce Thierry Cheung , who worked with Franco on the movie Do n't Come Back From The Moon last year , it finds Franco playing The Warlord , an enforcer for Tattooed Face , a futurist gangster played by former Wu-Tang Clan rapper Method Man .
Meanwhile , Milla Jovovich plays The Druglord , Lucy Lui plays The Queen ( not that one ) and Snoop Dogg ( yes , that one ) plays Love Lord .
The trailer does n't inspire huge levels of confidence either , nor does that fact that it finished shooting all the way back in 2016 .
It 's due out in just a few weeks in the US , with no UK release date announced as yet .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — For the first time in nearly 30 years , the Senate has confirmed a judicial nominee without a seal of approval from a home state senator .
The 56-42 vote Tuesday to confirm David Stras of Minnesota demonstrates anew Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 's resolve in getting President Donald Trump 's judicial nominees confirmed .
The Republican-led Senate went ahead with a committee hearing and a vote for Stras despite one of their home state senators , former Democratic Sen. Al Franken , declining to return what is referred to as a `` blue slip . ''
Over the years , senators could derail a vote by not returning their blue slip . The last time a judge was confirmed without two blue slips was 1989 .
Stras will join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit .

PYONGYANG , North Korea ( AP ) — Former NBA star Dennis Rodman , on low-key return to Pyongyang , has given the North Korean sports minister a copy of President Donald Trump 's book `` The Art of the Deal . ''
It was n't signed by Trump , who was Rodman 's boss for two seasons of the `` Celebrity Apprentice '' reality TV show .
Rodman 's arrival on Tuesday came just hours after the North decided to release Otto Warmbier , an American university student who had been imprisoned for 15 years with hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda banner .
Warmbier , who had been confined for 17 months , has apparently fallen into a coma not long after their confinement began . Pyongyang said Thursday saying it decided to let them go for `` humanitarian reasons . ''
Officials in Washington and Pyongyang said Rodman played no role in the release .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The former chief financial officer of a company that licensed the name and recipes of the chef who inspired the tyrannical “ Soup Nazi ” character on the TV comedy “ Seinfeld ” pleaded guilty on Monday to tax evasion , according to court records .
Robert Bertrand , 63 , pleaded guilty to one count of failing to pay taxes before U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen in Brooklyn federal court . Michael Weil , a lawyer for Bertrand , declined to comment on the plea .
Bertrand , who was CFO of Soupman Inc , was charged by federal prosecutors in May with depriving the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of roughly $ 594,000 of taxes by failing to report $ 2.85 million of cash and stock that a subsidiary of Soupman quietly awarded employees from 2010 to 2014 .
Soupman , which was not charged , said at the time it was suspending Bertrand . The company could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday .
As part of their plea , Bertrand agreed to pay about $ 78,500 in restitution , representing the amount they personally benefited , according to John Marzulli , a spokesperson for the office of Acting U.S. Attorney Bridget Rohde in Brooklyn .
Based in the New York City borough of Staten Island , Soupman sells products under the Original SoupMan brand .
It traces its roots to 1984 , when Al Yeganeh opened their soup shop on West 55th Street in midtown Manhattan and soon began drawing long lines of customers .
Yeganeh was the inspiration for Yev Kassem , a character portrayed by Larry Thomas on a 1995 “ Seinfeld ” episode who was known for making customers follow strict ordering rules , or risk being shunted away with their forceful bellow : “ No soup for you ! ”
In published interviews , Yeganeh has said they were not a fan of the “ Soup Nazi ” name .

KINGSPORT , TN ( WJHL ) – An Eastman Chemical company spokesperson told News Channel 11 that a potentially harmful chemical released during a fire and explosions this week was a small amount and never left the plant site .
News Channel 11 also obtained an incident report from the National Response Center provided to us by TDEC or the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation . The document lists what caused the explosions an equipment failure .
Eastman said the incident happened during what it called an “ equipment swap ” in the coal gas area .
The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation said for the first time that , “ Emissions resulting from the explosion at Eastman on Oct. 4 were in excess of the limits set by TDEC and that such excess emissions were atypical from a normally operating process at Eastman . ”
The NRC incident report lists an equipment malfunction as the reason that “ Hydrogen Sulfide ” was released into the air .
During a press conference earlier this week Eastman officials told said “ Hydrogen ” and “ Carbon Monoxide ” were two agents emitted when the explosions happened .
In an emailed statement an Eastman spokesperson said the amount of Hydrogen Sulfide released was “ significantly less ” than is required to be reported to the government and that the company believes , “ The small amount of Hydrogen Sulfide was consumed at the time of the explosions and therefore did not leave the plant site . ”
According to state officials , the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating Wednesday 's explosion at Eastman . That process could take between eight and ten weeks to complete .

Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa seems like a pleasant person , but they remind us of a used car salesperson whenever he 's selling their upcoming budget .
One who does n't want you looking under the hood too closely while he 's making their sales pitch .
On Thursday , Sousa boasted to The Empire Club in Toronto that their fifth budget on April 27 will demonstrate that , `` Ontario is the leanest government with the lowest per-capita spending of any province . ''
Um , that 's been true for Ontario governments going back decades .
Since Ontario has the largest population of any province , it also has the advantage of economies of scale when delivering public services .
The Bill Davis Progressive Conservative government , for example , made exactly the same boast in 1981-82 that Sousa made Thursday .
When the Liberals are in power , they always boast about delivering services at the lowest per-capita cost of any province .
When they 're out of power , they always blame the party in power for not spending enough on government services . ( In fairness , all parties do it . )
What Sousa did n't say is that the Liberals have more than doubled Ontario 's debt to more than $ 300 billion since coming to power in 2003 , which has made Ontario the most indebted sub-sovereign ( non-national ) borrower in the world .
They did n't say the auditor general and Ontario 's Financial Accountability Office have warned the Liberals that they have plunged the province into precarious levels of debt .
Sousa claimed the Liberal scheme to borrow even more money from Ontario taxpayers to subsidize the electricity bills of hydro ratepayers -- even though they 're the same people -- is `` fairer because it does n't ask today 's generation alone to pay the entire freight . ''
That argument turns generations of fiscally prudent thinking -- that you do n't stick future generations with huge bills to pay for today 's services -- on its head .
Finally , Sousa repeated , for the umpteenth time , that this year 's budget will be balanced , later adding along with `` next year and the year after that . ''
Two problems . First , Sousa 's promising to balance a budget that wo n't come down until after the next Ontario election in 2018 .
Second , in 2003 , then Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty promised before the election not to raise our taxes .
And we all remember what happened after they won .
Have your say
Mystery surrounds reports about a member of staff who has been suspended from a school in Abbey Village .
The suspension was reported to have happened ‘ very suddenly , without warning and with immediate effect ' .
Chairman of governors at Abbey Village Primary School Eirian Molloy confirmed that a member of staff had been suspended but was not able to provide further comment .
In a statement Mrs Molloy said : “ I can confirm that a member of staff has been suspended .
“ We will not be commenting further at this time . ”
It is believed that parents of pupils at the school were informed of the suspension by letter , and told only that it was not in relation to any safeguarding issues .
Jennifer Malandra has eight years ' active service in the Navy and a Naval Academy education . Grant Keaton separated from the Air Force two weeks ago after nine years of active service and four years studying at the Air Force Academy . Both are in search of civilian jobs in the highly competitive tech industry . They and 23 others are wrapping up a 10-day program run by BreakLine , an educational program sponsored by a who 's who of Silicon Valley companies in search of bright candidates.The focus today was artificial intelligence and drones . Both specialties are creating jobs as a result of automation and robotics . The group was visiting Kespry , a Menlo Park drone company that has hired six veterans from the BreakLine program with service in the Army , Marines and Navy . Its drones operate autonomously for specialized applications in the mining , construction and insurance industries.Garrett Smith , a former Marine intelligence officer , demonstrated one of the Kespry drones to the BreakLine veterans on this sunny Tuesday . They say the military has been experimenting with and using drones for decades , so veterans have valuable skills that transfer well to civilian drone and AI jobs . BreakLine says the majority of its program participants get hired in the tech sector with starting pay around $ 140,000 , which is comparable to starting salaries for recent MBA graduates.The BreakLine program has teaches organizational and leadership skills needed to excel in the tech sector . Smith , Kespry 's head of business development , said veterans come with a mission-oriented background , know it takes hustle and a 24/7 commitment to get the job done , and understand the nature and value of teamwork .
WARWICK , R.I. ( AP ) — The scheduled auction of the Rhode Island home of five-time world boxing champion Vinny Paz has been canceled .
The auction of the Warwick home was scheduled for Wednesday but the website of Sullivan & Sullivan Auctioneers says it has been canceled . No reason was given . The auction was announced earlier this month following a foreclosure .
The 55-year-old Paz 's three-bedroom house has been subject to liens from both the Internal Revenue Service and the Rhode Island Department of Taxation .
Paz was arrested twice earlier this year . They were charged with assaulting a friend in February . They pleaded no contest in March to assaulting their girlfriend .
Paz is known for their comeback after they broke their neck in a car crash . Their story was dramatized in the 2016 film `` Bleed for This . ''
” It was scary , I never could have anticipated it would have happened to me - that it did happen to me will always be in the back of my mind . ”
Those were the harrowing words of a Lancaster student as the man who dragged them around before sexually assaulting them was jailed for six years .
Preston Crown Court . PIC BY ROB LOCK
Tony Tonderayi Mazaiwana , 38 , of Langdale Road , Lancaster , is believed to have spotted the victim around six minutes before launching the depraved attack , following them as they cut through an alleyway .
They were grabbed around the mouth and dragged to a car , where they forced their face down onto the bonnet and attacked her , only stopping when a man walked out of the ginnel .
The married dad-of-three was found guilty of the sexual assault , which happened on Saturday , December 10 , near Milking Stile Lane , Lancaster , following a trial at Preston Crown Court .
CCTV showed them walking around Lancaster in the moments before they saw the victim and began to follow them
In a personal statement the woman said they had been stressed about walking home from their lectures since the attack , particularly in the dark .
They said they felt “ nervous whenever someone is behind her ” and that it affected their ability to revise for exams shortly after incident
bartender .
Defending , Paul Humphreys said Mazaiwana , who suffers epilepsy , was “ struggling to come to terms ” with what they had done and did not remember the incident .
They said : “ I do n't think he 's in a state of full acceptance because they have no recollection . They are devastated for the victim of this offence , they feel terribly sorry for them that they have been put through this ordeal .
“ He had n't gone out that night to look for someone . They had been to a Christmas party . ”
Judge Andrew Woolman said : “ You 'd been out at a works do and ended up in a club and must have had too much to drink and at some point you left the club and were walking around the streets of Lancaster .
“ At the same time in the early hours the victim was walking home after their night out . They were rather drunk , and their shoes were killing them so she 'd taken them off .
“ At some point you and they must have crossed paths and it is quite clear that for some six minutes at least you were following them down the road , for 350 yards or so .
“ At 2.50am they got to Milking Stile Lane , a dark narrow ginnel , and that was the place where you decided you were going to assault them Towards the end of the ginnel you attacked them from behind and you put your hand over their mouth , pushed them out of the end of the ginnel and forcibly put their face down on the bonnet and pulled down them tights .
“ It must have been a terrifying experience for them
“ Fortunately , if there is any fortunately about it , at that point a man emerged from the ginnel and you ran off .
“ This is every woman 's worst nightmare , being attacked from behind at night , while alone .
Although you say you have no recollection of it , that 's what the jury found you did .
“ In all other respects you are described as a decent , upright man , with no previous convictions and it is truly astonishing that someone like you should commit , and out of the blue , offence like this . ”

Pink 's opinion of Dr. Luke is n't pretty .
The pop star was asked about Lukasz “ Dr . Luke ” Gottwald , who has been embroiled in a legal battle with Kesha since 2014 , in a recent interview for The New York Times . Pink did not hold back .
“ I do n't know what happened , ” they said of Kesha 's allegations that the producer sexually and verbally abused them “ But I know that regardless of whether or not Dr. Luke did that , this is their karma and they earned it because he 's not a good person . ”
Pink , who worked with Gottwald in 2006 , did n't stop there .
“ I have told them that to their face and I do not work with him , ” they continued . “ He does n't do good business , he 's not a kind person , they do n't do the right thing when given ample opportunities to do so , and I do n't really feel that bad for him . ”
Pink is n't alone in airing their distaste for the Sony producer .

The 25-year-old suspect who plowed a van into a crowded Toronto sidewalk was ordered held Tuesday on 10 counts of murder and 13 of attempted murder as Canadian authorities and the public sought to make sense of one of the deadliest mass killings in the country 's modern history .
Alek Minassian showed little emotion as they made a brief appearance in a Toronto courtroom in a white jumpsuit and handcuffs . The judge ordered them detained without bond and scheduled the next hearing for May 10 .
Their father , Vahe Minassian , cried and looked stunned inside the courtroom . Asked outside if they had any message for the families of the victims , they said quietly : `` I 'm sorry . ''
Police , meanwhile , continued to gather evidence . About 20 officers made their way down the van 's deadly path on Yonge Street , which remained closed to traffic on Tuesday and taped off with yellow crime scene tape . Nearby , mourners had put together a makeshift memorial to the victims .
`` It was like they were playing a video game , trying to kill as many people as possible , '' said Panna Patel , 42 , who stopped by the memorial and had been at the scene a day earlier , getting cash from an ATM . `` He was looking people directly in the eye , making eye contact , it was so scary . They are n't remorseful at all . ''
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dismissed the possibility of terrorism , saying that authorities saw no national security element in the case .
They told a news conference that the incident `` has n't changed the overall threat level in Canada , '' though it occurred as Cabinet ministers from the G7 nations were meeting in Toronto .
Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive , though `` the incident definitely looked deliberate , '' Police Chief Mark Saunders told reporters at a late-night news conference on Monday .
Saunders said Minassian , who lives in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill , had not been known to police previously . An online social media profile described them as a college student .
Authorities released few details in the case , saying the investigation was still underway , with witnesses being interviewed and surveillance video being examined .
`` We are looking very strongly to what the exact motivation was for this particular incident to take place , '' Saunders said . `` We need every single piece of this puzzle so we can have a fulsome picture and account as to exactly what took place here . ''
The driver was heading south on busy Yonge Street around 1:30 p.m. Monday , the streets crowded with people enjoying the first warm day of spring , when the van jumped onto the sidewalk .
Ali Shaker , who was driving near the van at the time , told Canadian broadcast outlet CP24 that the driver appeared to be moving deliberately through the crowd at more than 30 mph .
`` He just went on the sidewalk , '' a distraught Shaker said . `` He just started hitting everybody , man . They hit every single person on the sidewalk . Anybody in their way they would hit . ''
Another witness , Peter Kang , told CTV News that the driver did not seem to make any effort to stop .
`` If it was an accident they would have stopped , '' Kang said . `` But the person just went through the sidewalk . They could have stopped . ''
Video broadcast on several Canadian outlets showed police arresting the driver , dressed in dark clothes , after officers surrounded them and their rental Ryder van several blocks from where the incident occurred in the North York neighborhood of northern Toronto . They appeared to make some sort of gesture at the police with an object in their hand just before they ordered them to lie down on the ground and took them away .
Witness Phil Zullo said that they saw police arresting the suspect and people `` strewn all over the road '' where the incident occurred .
`` I must have seen about five , six people being resuscitated by bystanders and by ambulance drivers , '' Zullo said . `` It was awful . Brutal . ''
Police shut down the Yonge and Finch intersection following the incident and Toronto 's transit agency suspended service on the subway line running through the area . The stretch of Yonge Street where the victims were struck was expected to stay blocked off for several days as police continue what is likely to be a lengthy investigation . Most businesses in the area were closed .
Trudeau on Monday expressed their sympathies for those involved .
`` We should all feel safe walking in our cities and communities , '' they said . `` We are monitoring this situation closely , and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians . ''
The incident prompted police to beef up security and close several streets around the Air Canada Centre on Monday night for the Toronto-Boston NHL playoff game . Police tweeted that similar road closures may be in effect for the Toronto Raptors NBA playoff game on Wednesday night .
The incident occurred as Cabinet ministers from the major industrial countries were gathered in Canada to discuss a range of international issues in the run-up to the G7 meeting near Quebec City in June . Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale called the incident a `` horrific attack '' and said the G7 foreign ministers extended their condolences .

Wu-Tang Clansman Method Man stopped by Late Night With Seth Meyers last night to talk about their roles on the HBO dramas The Deuce and The Wire , Donald Trump 's annoying rap voice , and why rappers make such great actors . In fact , Meth 's reasoning for the latter ? “ Rappers are great liars . With a straight face too ! ” Using Kanye West as an example , they elaborated that they remembered Kanye West building themselves up by saying , “ I 'm a god , ” but quickly qualified that , “ Kanye is a god ! ”
The well-respected , classic New York rapper also told a hilarious story about getting dressed up on Easter to take in Godzilla movies with their dad , how they got Donald Trump to make a cameo on their 1998 sophomore album , Tical 2000 : Judgment Day ( Russell Simmons hooked it up ) , and their inspiration for the hairdo their character , Rodney , sports in The Deuce ( spoiler alert : it 's a reference to one Reverend Al Sharpton ) . Meth was all dappered down for the interview , which may be a departure from their usual streetwise style , but all their trademark charisma remained intact .
Method Man will be returning to music with the release of the new Wu-Tang Clan album , Wu-Tang : The Saga Continues , due on October 13 and featuring the hard-bodied , “ People Say ” with Redman .

CHARLOTTESVILLE , Va. ( Reuters ) - Sandy Cook , a 70-year-old former schoolteacher , bent low in front of the slate `` Freedom of Speech Wall '' outside Charlottesville City Hall on Monday and wrote a message : `` Resist with courage , dignity and purpose . ''
Them plea was one of dozens etched in chalk on the 54-foot ( 16.5 m ) wall following this weekend 's violent clashes in the Virginia city .
`` This city is not racist '' and `` Unity over evil , '' read two other messages .
As Charlottesville reeled from the killing of a woman during a white-nationalist rally , well-wishers left flowers at a makeshift shrine nearby in the heart of downtown .
Many of the city 's 47,000 residents blamed white supremacists for bringing violence to their normally sedate city , the home of the University of Virginia 's main campus .
`` Charlottesville is a very tolerant place , which is why it 's so sad to see this happen here , '' said Cook , who now works as a tour guide at Monticello , the former home of Thomas Jefferson , the United States ' third president and the city 's founder .
`` I am hoping that more people will come down here and will show that we are not going to let these people take over our town , '' Cook said as they gazed at the wall , which bears a carving of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , which guarantees freedom of speech for all Americans .
On Saturday , violence broke out ahead of a `` Unite the Right '' rally called by white supremacists to protest the planned removal of a statue of a leader of the pro-slavery Confederate army , a symbol considered an affront to African-Americans .
After the melee , as counterprotesters were dispersing , a 20-year-old man who friends say admired Adolf Hitler smashed their car into the crowd , killing a 32-year-old woman .
Mario Jones , the 42-year-old owner of a cab company , said they had been shocked by Saturday 's event , largely because they have rarely encountered racist behavior in the city , which is 70 percent white and 19 percent black .
They said protest organizer Jason Kessler misled city officials by saying the rally was focused on the statue of General Robert E. Lee in a state that has long had mixed feelings about its slaveholding past .
`` He started with a focus on the statue and a focus on preserving history , and then when they had the platform , they flipped it to white supremacy , '' said Jones , who is black , as they stood outside the courthouse where the driver in Saturday 's incident was ordered held without bail .
Russ Naranjo , 45 , stopped to write `` Kessler did this ! ! '' on the wall , replacing each `` s '' in the name with the emblem of the Nazi SS secret police .
`` He is a Nazi and they brought this here and then they got in over their head and ran away , '' said Naranjo , who works in security .
Kessler was punched on Sunday when they attempted to hold a press conference and was ushered away by police .
On Monday they blamed the police for the violence , saying they allowed the event to get out of control . A spokesperson for the Virginia State Police , Corinne Geller , denied that claim .
Naranjo said the hundreds of so-called `` alt-right '' white supremacists who attended Saturday 's rally had been emboldened by Republican U.S. President Donald Trump .
`` The alt-right has sprung up because of Donald Trump and they need to do more to denounce them , '' Naranjo said .
After being criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike for failing to respond forcefully to Saturday 's violence , Trump on Monday denounced white supremacists .
While many residents and city leaders blamed the violence on white supremacists , some said both sides were at fault .
`` Both sides came to fight , '' said Mason Pickett , 64 , the retired owner of a moving and storage company . `` I think if the people on the left would have stood there calmly , the people on the right would not have kicked ass . ''

MANCHESTER , England ( AP ) — Manchester City scored its 100th goal of the season on the way to a 3-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday to extend its lead in the Premier League to 15 points .
Fernandinho , Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero scored as City won a 12th consecutive home league game .
West Brom is three points adrift at the bottom of the division .
While the ( scorer ) of City 's opening goal was a surprise , the source of the assist was predictable . De Bruyne played a defense-splitting pass through to Fernandinho who squeezed their shot past Ben Foster at the near post to give the home side the lead after 20 minutes .
City suffered a blow shortly before the break as David Silva was forced off injured , just days after Leroy Sané was ruled out for six weeks .
West Brom fought on despite rarely threatening but had its challenge effectively ended in the 68th when De Bruyne appropriately scored City 's 100th goal of the season in all competitions .
The Belgium midfielder , who has been at the center of City 's near perfect season to this point , played Raheem Sterling behind the visitors ' defense before receiving the ball back and finishing neatly from close range .
Daniel Sturridge came off the bench to make their West Brom debut after joining on loan from Liverpool until the end of the season , but wasted their side 's best chance of the game , before Aguero showed them how it 's done .
Sterling was the creator once more as they slid Aguero in behind the defense , before the Argentina striker dinked the ball over the oncoming Foster with just a minute remaining .
Now that the NFL regular season is over , the 2017 opponents for every team have been finalized . The dates and times of each game will be determined in the spring , when the full regular-season schedule is released .
Click the links after each team to view the full lists .
Arizona Cardinals : Neither the Cardinals ' road nor home schedule will be easier than the other next season . It 's 2016 playoff teams galore. ? Full list .
Atlanta Falcons : ? With a first-place finish in the NFC South , the Falcons will face the first-place teams in both the NFC East and NFC West : Dallas and Seattle . The latter is Atlanta 's only extended trip . Full list .
Baltimore Ravens : ? The Ravens defense will be tested again next season with a 2017 slate featuring five of the league 's top quarterbacks . Full list .
Buffalo Bills : ? The Bills have the misfortune of playing the AFC West next season , including a road matchup with one of the two division 's 2016 playoff teams . Full list .
Carolina Panthers : ? The Panthers have the potential for some cold games with trips to Chicago , Detroit , New England and New York ( Jets ) . Full list .
Chicago Bears : ? Strength of schedule is overrated . The Bears supposedly had one of the easiest 2016 schedules -- and they finished 3-13 . On paper -- outside of the division -- Chicago 's schedule appears palatable . Full list .
Cincinnati Bengals : ? On the surface , this looks like a much easier schedule than in 2016 , when the Bengals faced six playoff teams . Next season wo n't be a walk in the park , however . Full list .
Cleveland Browns : ? Any team that stared down an 0-16 finish should consider any schedule tough . But overall , this is a Browns-friendly slate. ? Full list .
Dallas Cowboys : ? There has n't been a repeat champion in the NFC East since 2003-04 . And with ? seven games against 2016 playoff teams on the docket for Dallas next year , it could be a challenge for the Cowboys to break that trend . Full list .
Denver Broncos : ? It could be a season of transition for the Broncos , but the Super Bowl 50 champs will get five of their toughest opponents at home in Denver . Full list .
Detroit Lions : It 's an intriguing lineup for the Lions , but one that is likely to be more difficult than the records of their opponents would indicate . Full list .
Green Bay Packers : ? For the second straight year , the Packers wo n't have to play west of the Central time zone , making their travel about as light as possible . Full list .
Houston Texans : ? The Texans might not be able to rely on divisional play for five or more wins next season as ? Andrew Luck ? is no longer Houston 's only threat in the AFC South . Full list .
Indianapolis Colts : ? The Colts have missed the playoffs in back-to-back seasons , but hope could be on the horizon with only four games vs. 2016 playoff teams -- two of which are against Houston . Full list .
Jacksonville Jaguars : ? The Jaguars -- who will have a new head coach -- could be facing as many as six new head coaches in 2017 . Full list .
Kansas City Chiefs : ? The 2017 schedule will be no picnic for the Chiefs no matter how the games are ordered : They have eight games against 2016 playoff teams . Full list .
Los Angeles Rams : ? The Rams will lose a traditional home game for the second straight year by hosting Arizona from London . The 2017 schedule will be challenging but not as difficult as the one from 2016 . Full list .
Miami Dolphins : ? This is not an easy schedule for Miami , which finished second in the AFC East . The Dolphins will get at least three tough games against the AFC West , one of the best divisions in the NFL . Full list .
Minnesota Vikings : ? The Vikings ' schedule will include at least four games against playoff teams . It probably represents a step up in class after the Vikings faced the meager AFC South this season . Full list .
New England Patriots : ? The Patriots will be traveling to Denver for the third straight regular season , and they will also take on the Falcons and Panthers at home. ? Full list .
New Orleans Saints : ? The opponents are n't any more overwhelming than in any typical year , but the locations could make for a grueling travel schedule with a pair of potential cold-weather games and trips as far east as London and as far west as Los Angeles . Full list .
New York Giants : ? Get the frequent flier miles ready . The Giants will do a lot more traveling in 2017 , making four trips to Denver and beyond . Full list .
New York Jets : ? The AFC West , one of the best divisions in the league , is on the docket for the Jets next season with a road trip to Oakland. ? Full list .

Pittsburgh Steelers : The Steelers get a slight upgrade to the schedule in 2017 , with ? only a few games that stand out as major challenges . Full list .
Philadelphia Eagles : ? The Eagles have been fortunate to log a limited number of air miles during the past two seasons , but that will change with three West Coast trips . Full list .
San Diego Chargers : ? The road schedule is tough for the Chargers , with five playoff teams and four games on the East Coast . But the home schedule has several winnable games . Full list .
San Francisco 49ers : ? The best news for San Francisco is the NFC West has lost some of its luster . And while the ? NFC East will ? provide a stiff test for the 49ers , they also get the AFC South . Full list .
Seattle Seahawks : ? Even though it 's a first-place schedule , the 2017 slate does n't appear all that daunting at first glance . Full list .
Tampa Bay Buccaneers : Tampa Bay will need some momentum heading into a 2017 schedule that features four 2016 MVP candidates. ? Full list .
Tennessee Titans : Next season looks manageable for the Titans , with only two opportunities for cold-weather games and at least ? four games against teams with new coaches . Full list .
Washington Redskins : Three home opponents with ? 10 wins in 2016 , three others who were strong ? Super Bowl contenders and three West Coast trips -- three reasons Washington 's 2017 schedule does n't look easy . Full list .

NEW YORK ( AP ) — Whitney Houston 's mother had no clue about allegations that their son and superstar daughter were molested as children until the making of the new documentary `` Whitney , '' says the film 's executive producer .
Patricia Houston , the sister-in-law of Whitney , is responsible for getting the film , out Friday , to screen . Directed by Kevin Macdonald , `` Whitney '' paints an intimate portrait of the Grammy-winning pop queen and movie star through interviews with their brothers , their mother , friends , and behind-the-scenes footage . Houston 's regal image over the decades was eroded by erratic behavior due to their drug use ; they died in 2012 , on the eve of the Grammys , after being discovered unresponsive in a hotel bathtub . They were 48 .
It 's the second documentary on Houston : `` Whitney : Can I Be Me '' was released earlier this year .
Patricia Houston , wife of Gary Garland-Houston , said it was difficult making `` Whitney '' because it hit so close to home — and because they were the one who had to tell Cissy Houston not only that there were abuse allegations , but they would be in the film .
`` It was deeply a revelation for them You think about her , and it being a bit overbearing for them to hear — and their kids not telling them That 's pretty tough to have to deal with , '' said Houston .
Dee Dee Warwick , the niece of Cissy Houston and sister to Dionne Warwick , was the alleged abuser . The alleged incidents took place when Gary and Whitney were between the ages of 7 and 9 and Cissy was touring . Warwick , who was 18 years older than Whitney Houston , died in 2008 .
The documentary suggests that the sexual abuse endured by the children was a significant contributor to their struggles with drugs as adults .
`` I do n't think you can explain anyone 's life from one particular event that 's happened to them . But I think that it 's certainly fair to say that it 's maybe , in my opinion , the major contributor to Whitney 's unhappiness , '' MacDonald said . `` That and the fact that they never talked about it , and that nobody in the family talked about this and clearly it happened as you 'd learned in the film . ''
MacDonald says the secrets in Houston 's life took their toll on the Grammy-winning singer . They cite a clip in the film shot in the mid-2000s that shows them in conflict .
`` I think there 's an amazing piece of home movie footage in the film , which was from the early 2000s where Whitney is sort of really looking despairing . ... she 's talking to herself , really going , 'Nippy calling Whitney . Whitney calling Nippy . ' And Nippy was their sort of nickname that everybody close to them knew them as Nippy . And Nippy was the real her , as it were , the intimate them Whitney was the persona , '' Macdonald said .
`` I think what you see in that home movie clip is this confusion that they have . I think it got progressively worse as they got older . The confusion between what 's the real me , and what 's not the real me . And obviously , the drugs did n't help with that , '' Macdonald said .
After “ Who are Rey 's parents ? ” perhaps the biggest unanswered question from Star Wars : The Force Awakens is how Captain Phasma , the chromed-out stormtrooper commander , managed to get off Starkiller Base before the weaponized planet exploded .
As you undoubtedly recall , Phasma was tossed into a trash compactor by Han Solo , Finn , and Chewbacca . That 's the last we saw of the towering trooper before the base was blown up . But , thanks to the The Last Jedi trailer , we know the character ( played by Gwendoline Christie ) is back for Episode VIII . Marvel , which previously devoted a one-off comic book to how C-3PO got their red arm , will show us the presumably harrowing details of their escape in Journey to Star Wars : The Last Jedi— Captain Phasma .
“ The Star Wars films , with so many fantastic characters , obviously ca n't be a ‘ Phasma story , ' and it 's especially cool that Phasma is getting explored in depth in both their forthcoming novel and comic book , ” series writer Kelly Thompson said in a press release .
“ The most exciting thing to me about our miniseries is that we were given the awesome responsibility of bridging a gap between Force Awakens and Last Jedi — of answering the question of what happened to Phasma after they went into that trash chute . Anytime you get to write official Star Wars is pretty incredible , but getting to decide what that link is , for a super intriguing character in some of the most epic movies of all time , is next level ! ”

First Australian band I ever heard live . Lied to my parents and told them I was staying at a friends house but we stayed at Moomba til late so we could see them live for free . Got pretty close to the front too . -Holly
I was 14 , and we were driving home from the Bellarine Peninsula after a day-trip . As with most of our family drives , I had placed myself in change of music , selecting the six albums that would go into our Commodore 's six-stack CD player . Wanting to appease my father – and emulate their tastes in music – I choose a compilation album called Super 70s , which had this very track on it . From the moment it began playing , I was mesmerised by every aspect “ Year of the Cat ” – the haunting vocals , the poetic lyrics , the piano chords , and the epic guitar/saxophone solos . From that moment on , “ Year of the Cat ” became my favourite song of all time .

Snippet of the new Jeezy x Kendrick Lamar x J. Cole song dropping Friday pic.twitter.com/WjWEUEsPp2 — Rap Favorites ( @ RapFavPosts ) December 12 , 2017
A group of lucky fans at Jeezy ‘ s listening party Monday night got a special treat . They got to be the first to hear the much-anticipated track featuring both Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole early .
Fortunately , in the era of camera phones and social media , those of us who were n't so fortunate to be in attendance get to listen to “ American Dream ” from Jeezy 's new album Pressure before its release this Friday . The video above contains both of the verses , minus Jeezy 's , which sets up an intriguing mystery about what the original trap rapper 's verse will sound like .
From the preview , it appears both verses are full of political commentary and double-time rhyming over a hard-hitting beat , with Kendrick flipping a number of different flows and J. Cole addressing poverty and the illicit drug trade that often stems from it .
Fans of the two rappers have long clamored for a joint album from them , but according to Top Dawg Entertainment boss Punch , such a project will probably never actually come out , so this makes for a nice consolation prize for the time being .
However , they do have a habit of popping up at each other 's shows and share a number of mutual contacts in contemporaries like Wale and Chance The Rapper , so it 's not like we wo n't get plenty of opportunities to hear them split mic duties in the future . Showing up together in an unexpected place like Jeezy 's upcoming album is just icing on the cake .
Recently , news went viral on social media that Amin crooner , Oyindamola Johnson Emmanuel , aka Dammy Krane , was arrested and detained in Miami , USA , for allegations of credit card fraud which seems to have tarnished the image of the once very much loved singer .
In a new development , while speaking in a recent interview , the handsome singer called on the general public and their fans to pray for their discharge and acquittal on the court case which comes up again at an undisclosed date in Miami .
“ Everybody knows that I 'm just all about my music ; I 'm a musician I do n't do flight bookings , I 'm innocent of the allegation . Everyone should please pray for me to come out of this successfully ” , they pleaded . Speaking on the present situation of the case , they said ; “ I 've a hearing soon , but my lawyer tells me I do n't have to be there , like I said God is in control ; everybody should just keep praying and supporting me .
I did a song I recorded a day after I actually got out of jail , I was talking about all these things , especially the prayers my fans said for me , I actually appreciate everybody and I put it in a song and I 'm going to be dropping it soon ” , they said .

Manufacturing in New York state expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years as factories received more new orders and stepped up hiring .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Wednesday that its Empire State manufacturing index in February rose to 18.7 from 6.5 , reaching the highest level since 2014 . Any reading above zero indicates expansion .
The survey adds to recent evidence that the U.S. manufacturing sector is recovering after nearly two years of mostly flat output . Businesses are spending more on machinery and other big-ticket factory goods , and overseas economies have stabilized .
A measure of new orders jumped to 13.5 from 3.1 and a measure of unfilled orders rose for the first time since 2011 . Both gauges point to much stronger demand for factory goods .

The culmination of months of preparation and rehearsals saw 60 pupils take part in a successful stage production of the Madness musical .
The pupils and Sir William Robertson Academy took to the stage to perform the hit show ‘ Our House ' in what is being described as their ‘ most ambitious show yet ' .
Action from the school 's stage production .
Our House is a musical with music and lyrics by Madness and based on a book by playwright Tim Firth . It won the 2003 Olivier award for Best New Musical .
Pupils from years seven through to year 13 made up the cast of the show to entertain parents , pupils , staff and friends over three days .
The musical was put together by SWRA 's drama and music departments and led by Bryony Burrough , head of drama and Mike Willson , head of music .
“ Once again I have been amazed at the talent of our students at SWRA , ” said Miss Burrough . “ Our House has been our most ambitious show yet , both on the stage and behind the scenes .
“ Our lead , Ewan Armstrong who played Joe Casey , changed costume 25 times per show , making it 100 costume changes throughout show week . On top of this the production team , made up of SWRA 's finest students and PGCE student Mr Barnes , were juggling revolving doors , a very heavy Morris Miner and a lightsaber or two each night .
“ I have been truly impressed with the maturity and motivation that our drama and music students have given this year , their acting , singing and dancing improves year on year and our school shows would not be as successful without their dedication . ”
They added : “ There is so much talent at SWRA and the students have made us extremely proud .
“ We are very much looking forward to what our next production brings . ”
Our House follows the two paths that Joe 's life could take after that fateful night ; one path means a criminal record and social exclusion , while the other will lose them the girl that they love .
Some of those who attended the production took to Facebook to leave their reviews . Comments included :
l ‘ It was brilliant . Ca n't praise all of the cast and staff highly enough . '
l ‘ The show was amazing , we absolutely loved it . The standard was incredibly high and my daughter loved being a part of it ' .
l ‘ We were blown away with the talent and professionalism of all cast/crew ' .

Cheers to sustainability with biodegradable beer packaging
A company has invented edible and biodegradable six-pack holders for beer cans .
E6PR , which is short for ‘ eco six-pack ring ' , has developed the green packaging to reduce pollution in the oceans and avoid animals being harmed by trying to eat plastic or being strangled by it .
The new holder , made from wheat and barley instead of petroleum-based products , means fish or other marine animals can safely nibble on the rings , which are designed to break down quickly in ocean water .
Even on the beach , the engineers say the material can break down in 60 to 90 days .
The product is currently being tested by the Saltwater Brewery in the US – it even uses waste from the brewery in its construction so has a minimal carbon footprint .
Los Angeles Dodgers ' Enrique Hernandez , right , and relief pitcher Kenley Jansen celebrate after the Dodgers defeated the Cleveland Indians 6-4 in a baseball game , Wednesday , June 14 , 2017 , in Cleveland . ( AP Photo/Tony Dejak )
CLEVELAND ( AP ) -- Cleveland relief ace Andrew Miller gave up a tiebreaking home run for the second straight night - a solo shot to pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez in the eighth inning - and the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Indians 6-4 on Wednesday night .
Hernandez , batting for Chase Utley , hit a 1-2 pitch that barely cleared the wall in right field . Hernandez pumped their fist as they rounded first base after their homer gave Los Angeles a 3-2 lead .
Miller ( 3-2 ) wore a shocked expression as they walked to the left of the mound after the home run . The left-hander , who has been virtually unhittable , allowed a leadoff homer to Cody Bellinger in the eighth - the first they gave up this season - that broke a tie in the Dodgers ' 7-5 win Tuesday .
Miller was charged with four runs in 2/3 of an inning after throwing 25 pitches Tuesday and the Indians ( 31-31 ) dropped to .500 for the first time since April 19 .
Josh Fields ( 3-0 ) allowed Jose Ramirez 's game-tying home run in the seventh . Kenley Jansen worked the ninth for their 13th save and second of the series as the Dodgers won their sixth straight .
Indians manager Terry Francona returned to the dugout after being hospitalized for a few hours Tuesday night . They underwent a battery of tests and was released early Wednesday .
Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig was in the lineup after appealing their one-game suspension by Major League Baseball for making an obscene gesture to Indians fans on Tuesday night .
Puig , also fined for the incident , was booed in each at-bat and theirs
two strikeouts brought some of the biggest cheers of the night .
Corey Kluber of the Indians gave up four hits and struck out 10 in seven innings but allowed two runs in the second , a rally that consisted of a walk , a double , two infield hits and Chris Taylor 's steal of home that occurred on the back end of a double steal .
Taylor also had a two-run single in the eighth .
Dodgers starter Brandon McCarthy was charged with one run in 5 1/3 innings .
TRAINER 'S ROOM
Dodgers : LHP Julio Urias ( left shoulder irritation ) was placed on the DL at Triple-A Oklahoma City . They were 0-2 with a 5.40 ERA in five starts for Los Angeles .
Indians : 2B Jason Kipnis ( neck spasms ) was scratched from the lineup and replaced by Erik Gonzalez .
UP NEXT
Dodgers : LHP Rich Hill is 1-0 with a 2.57 ERA in three road starts this season . They made 63 relief appearances for Cleveland in 2013 .
Indians : RHP Josh Tomlin is tied for the major league lead with eight losses to go with three wins .
The Niagara RiverHawks returned to the win column doubling the short-staffed Dunnville Mudcats 4-2 in Provincial Junior Hockey League action Saturday night at Gale Centre .
Despite coming to Niagara Falls with only 16 players , it was the Mudcats who struck first . A power-play goal 5:49 into the game put them up 1-0 .
Dunnville 's lead was short-lived , however . Daniel Volpatti found the back of the net for Niagara a minute later , and the game was tied at 1-1 heading into the second period .
The teams also traded goals to start the middle frame , this time in reverse order . Frankie Franck gave the RiverHawks the lead with a power-play goal at the 4:50 mark only to see the Mudcats knot the score three minutes later .
Newly acquired forward Kyle Reeves , playing in their second game for the RiverHawks , scored their first goal in junior hockey at 10:10 to give Niagara a 3-2 lead after 40 minutes .
Volpatti added their second of the game into the empty net at 19:21 of the third period to round out the scoring .
The RiverHawks were 1-for-4 on the power play ; Dunnville , 1-for-5 .
Shots were 31 apiece , with Sebastian Iannone stopping 29 shots in the Niagara net earning the victory .
With the win , the RiverHawks improved their record to 8-11-3-3 moving one point ahead of the 9-15-2-1 Mudcats to take over fifth place in the eight-team South Bloomfield Division .
After five games the season series between the two teams is tied at two wins apiece . A Nov. 30 game in Niagara Falls ended in a 3-3 tie in overtime .
Niagara is scheduled to play two games their week . The RiverHawks are home to the Port Dover Sailors Thursday for a 7:30 p.m. faceoff at Gale Centre , and visit the Simcoe Shamrocks two days later for at 8:30 p.m. puck drop .
Niagara trails Port Dover 1-2 in head-to-head play and is 4-0 against Simcoe in league play so far this season .

NEW YORK ( CBSNewYork ) — A Manhasset man accused of attacking a 94-year-old man faces a judge Monday .
Police escorted a handcuffed Daryl Wright , 39 , to their arraignment Monday morning .
Authorities say Wright got into an argument with the elderly man over parking at the Great Neck Plaza on Sunday and pushed them to the ground .
The man was taken to the hospital and treated for a broken leg .
President Donald Trump is expected to `` decertify '' Iran 's compliance with the Iran nuclear agreement next week because their administration has determined it no longer serves America 's national security interests , sources have told ABC News .
Trump has until Oct. 15 to make a decision about Iran 's compliance in the 2015 agreement , which they have repeatedly called one of the `` worst deals '' for the United States . They last recertified Iran 's compliance in July .
If Trump chooses decertification , Congress must decide within 60 days whether or not to reimpose nuclear sanctions against Iran , which would constitute a material breach and could effectively destroy the agreement .
The president 's own top military officials and diplomats have said Iran is in technical compliance with the Iran deal . But , in recent months , they 've also played a balancing game : seeming to recommend the U.S. stay in the deal , while at the same time giving the president room to say it is n't in America 's national security interests .
Here 's what three top officials have been saying about the Iran deal .
Secretary of Defense James Mattis
Twelve days before the Oct. 15 deadline , Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee that it was in America 's national security interest to remain part of the agreement .
They went on to say that `` If we can confirm that Iran is living by the agreement , if we can determine that this is in our best interest , then clearly , we should stay with it . I believe , at this point in time , absent indications to the contrary , it is something the president should consider staying with . ''
But Mattis immediately couched that response , adding , `` There is another requirement we certify that it 's in our best interest . ”
The certification process is not part of the agreement , but a requirement of U.S. law , which says the president must determine every 90 days if Iran is complying and if the deal is in U.S. national security interests .
The Trump administration will reportedly use that second factor as grounds for decertification , given Iran 's destabilizing activity in the Middle East -- something Mattis has often raised .
“ The president has to consider , more broadly , things that rightly fall under their portfolio of looking out for the American people in areas that go beyond the specific letters of the JCPOA , '' they said , referring to the Iran deal 's formal name , the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action . `` In that regard , I support the rigorous review that they have got going on right now . ''
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford
`` Iran is not in material breach of the agreement , and I do believe the agreement to date has delayed the development of a nuclear capability by Iran , '' Dunford told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday .
Critics of the administration jumped on those remarks -- from Trump 's top military adviser , no less -- to bolster their claim that without the deal , Iran will be closer to a nuclear bomb .
Dunford also warned in their reconfirmation hearing before Congress last week that `` holding up agreements that we have signed , unless there 's a material breach , would have an impact on others ' willingness to sign agreements . ''
Like Mattis , they said that because Iran is in compliance with the deal , the U.S. `` should focus on addressing the other challenges : the missile threat they pose , the maritime threat they pose , the support of proxies , terrorists , and the cyberthreat they pose . ''
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
Tillerson acknowledged in early August that they and the president have had differences of opinion on the Iran deal , with Tillerson urging certification and Trump seeking ways to decertify . But more recent statements show the secretary trying to align with their commander in chief , at least publicly .
At the United Nations General Assembly in late September , Tillerson said Trump was `` very carefully considering '' whether the administration finds the Iran deal `` to continue to serve the security interests of the American people or not . ''
In particular , Tillerson has raised the issue of the deal 's so-called “ sunset provisions ” where limits on Iran 's nuclear program expire .
`` One can almost set the countdown clock to when Iran can resume its nuclear weapons programs , its nuclear activities , '' Tillerson said . `` And that 's something that the president simply finds unacceptable . ''
But citing a flaw that Trump can criticize the deal for does n't mean Tillerson favors tearing up the accord . Instead , they too have urged dealing with Iran 's other activities in addition to these shortcomings .
The agreement `` represents only a small part of the many issues that we need to deal with when it comes to the Iran relationship , '' they told reporters Wednesday .
( Reuters ) - A Bangladeshi man set off a homemade bomb strapped to their body at a New York commuter hub at rush hour on Monday , wounding themselves and three others in what New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called an attempted terrorist attack .
Mass transit systems have come under attack around the world . Here are several notable incidents :
Sept. 15 , 2017 - London : A homemade bomb on a packed rush-hour commuter train in London engulfed a carriage in flames and injured 30 people , but apparently failed to fully explode . Some people suffered burns and others were injured in a stampede to escape the station . A teenager who moved to Britain after their parents were killed in Iraq is scheduled to go on trial in March .
June 20 , 2017 - Brussels : A Moroccan national tried to detonate a suitcase bomb packed with nails and gas bottles at the Central train station . A soldier fatally shot the man , who prosecutors said was suspected of supporting the radical group Islamic State . The bomb , which partly detonated , did not hurt anyone .
March 22 , 2016 - Brussels : A suicide bomber detonated a bomb on a train in the city 's downtown Maelbeek subway station , about an hour after bomb attacks on the main airport , killing at least 30 people .
July 7 , 2005 - London : Four British Islamists carried out suicide bomb attacks on three London subway trains and a bus , killing 52 people .
March 11 , 2004 - Madrid : Ten bombs packed into sports bags and detonated by cellphones tore through four commuter trains , killing more than 190 people and injuring more than 1,800 . Three weeks later , seven men blew themselves up in a suburban apartment after police closed in on them .
March 20 , 1995 - Tokyo : Members of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult released sarin nerve gas in coordinated attacks on the subway system during the morning rush hour , killing 13 people and sickening thousands of others .
December 1994 - New York : A firebomb exploded on a crowded subway train in lower Manhattan , injuring 48 people , including the bomber , Edward Leary , 50 . Six days earlier , a firebomb planted by Leary went off on a subway in Manhattan 's Harlem section , injuring two teenagers . Leary drew a 94-year prison sentence for the two bombings .

Lane Kiffin is n't sticking around to run Alabama 's offense in the national championship game , bringing an end to a successful but sometimes tense three-year pairing with Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban .
Saban said Monday that Kiffin will leave to focus on their new job as Florida Atlantic 's head coach . Incoming offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian will replace them for the Jan. 9 game against Clemson in Tampa , Florida .
Kiffin and Saban said they made the decision after meetings following the Peach Bowl win over Washington .
`` We appreciate all that Lane has done for our football program over the last three years , '' Saban said . `` We sat down following the Washington game and talked about the time demands of managing both jobs , and we recognized that it is best for our players , and for Lane , that we allow them to turn their full attention to their new head coaching role at FAU .
`` This was n't an easy decision and we appreciate the way Lane handled this in terms of doing what is best for our team . At the end of the day , both of us wanted to put our players in the best position to be successful . ''
Sarkisian , who was fired from USC last season , had already been announced as Kiffin 's successor . He 's been working as an offensive analyst for the Tide since the week after the opener against the Trojans and now has only a week to prepare for the national title game .
Kiffin said it became apparent over the last couple of weeks that it would be better for both programs if they focused solely on the Florida Atlantic job . After meeting with Saban Sunday night and Monday morning , `` we mutually decided that it was in everyone 's best interests for the players and the program for Coach Sarkisian to take over all responsibilities as offensive coordinator for the championship game . ''
`` This was a very difficult decision , but it 's a decision made in the best interests of the program , '' Kiffin said . `` I look forward to helping Alabama win another championship , and would like to thank Coach Saban , the staff , and all the players and fans for the past three years at UA for an unforgettable time and championship run . Roll Tide ! ''
Saban hired Kiffin months after their firing at USC — famously at the airport after a late-night flight back from a game . The position gave them the chance to revitalize their career .
The pairing worked well on the field , when the Tide won three Southeastern Conference titles and earned a shot at a second national championship . But it was often tense .
Saban could be seen a number of times on the sidelines giving Kiffin an earful during games .
Kiffin was asked before the Peach Bowl if they could recall the happiest moment with Saban in a game .
`` I do n't recall a happy moment , '' they said , adding that they only remembers the many times they were chewed out . `` I wo n't take that part of the process with me , though . ''

Jess Phillips on the absolute sexism of the “ Absolute Boys ” on the Left…
“ They [ the left-wing men ] are the worst , the actual worst . Men said they supported better female representation but , when it came to losing their own jobs , they would say , ‘ Oh , you mean me ? But I am so clever . I 've got so much to offer the world ' . They are literally the worst . ”
NBA TV
Until the end of time , NBA fans and analysts will be arguing between Michael Jordan and LeBron James as to who was the better player and/or had the better professional basketball career . In some ways , that is an entertaining conundrum and , in others , it can be aggravating and even boring .
Still , when a player with Isiah Thomas ' Hall of Fame resume discusses a topic like determining the best NBA player of all-time , there is a certain amount of weight to their words . This week , Thomas discussed the James vs. Jordan hypothetical and , in the end , they emerged with two interesting takeaways .
One acknowledges the debate between the two players . While some believe that is the debate to determine the best ever , Thomas does n't necessarily agree .

Young people have the wrong idea about golf and it 's time to change their minds , say Chorley Golf Club .
It 's time for golf to throw off it 's stuffy image and throw its club house doors open to the next generation .
That 's according to the team at Chorley Golf Club , who are on a mission to spread the love of the game to the under 35s .
“ If you do n't know the game , people see it as something that old , posh people do , ” said Jeff Wignall , marketing manager at the Heath Charnock club .
But with a tide of young professional players , like Jordan Spieth , Roy McIlroy and Lydia Ko thrilling audiences across the globe , now is the time to reach out and break down those boundaries .
“ It is a sport that can be enjoyed by everyone . It 's challenging , sociable , it 's competitive and the handicap system means everyone can play together on equal terms . What 's more , it 's really good exercise , ” said Jeff .
A round of golf , they said , was essentially a four-hour walk , and the undulating nature of courses like Chorley offered the chance of a proper cardiovascular workout .
Far from the idea of golf as a low octane pursuit , studies have found players burn more than 700 calories over the course of a game . It 's also been shown to help with strength training and balance .
Many young people assume it is an expensive sport to get into , but that is not necessarily the case , said Jeff : particularly as joining a golf club is often less expensive than an annual gym membership .
“ In recent years , the cost of equipment has really come down . There are so many ways of getting everything you need at a cut price – you can hire it , buy second-hand or borrow from a club to get you started . ”
Jeff explained that golf was an extremely sociable pastime , which usually ended with a drink or two , which appealed to all ages and fostered a sense of community .
“ When I first started coming , I did n't know anyone , but I really quickly made friends . It 's that kind of atmosphere at a golf club . We are a community , ” they added .
Chorley is making strides towards attracting younger players , including preferential fees to the under 35s , and will welcome a 33-year-old captain , Darren Edwards , in 2019 .
“ The hierarchy of golf clubs tends to be dominated by older members , because they have the most experience and , if they are retired , more spare time . ”
However , it 's really important that clubs make sure the views and needs of younger players are represented .
“ I would recommend everyone , no matter what their age or background , to give golf a try . You get to meet and play against so many different people .
“ It 's a game that you can start young and carry on playing until the flag on your 18th hole flies as half-mast . ”

Charles Barkley : I 'd Get Rid Of Both The Republicans And Democrats Because They 're Both Awful
If you want the truth told , have Charles Barkley tell it !
The NBA Hall of Famer , turned “ NBA on TNT ” analyst has been critical of the political process .
“ I 'd get rid of both the republicans and the democrats because they 're both awful , ”
Charles Barkley said on the Scoop B Radio Podcast .
“ They fight all of the time like little kids , because we have serious issues , we need serious people trying to solve them . ”
Barkley has also been vocal about immigration .
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) was established in June 2012 under the Obama Administration and allows individuals , under restrictive conditions , who entered the country as minors , and had either entered or remained in the country without legal permission to do so , to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and to be eligible for a work permit .
As of 2017 , approximately 800,000 individuals were enrolled in the program created by DACA . “ You know , we have the situation with DACA , that 's really important . I 'm a big supporter of immigration , ” said Barkley .
Plans to begin phasing it out were initiated by the Trump Administration in September 2017 .
“ I think Hispanics are amazing people . I think they do amazing work , I think they do jobs black and whites do n't want to do , ” said Barkley .
“ I think we need to find a way to keep them here , plain and simple . ”

'' They added that the good functioning of the world economy depends on countries working together as partners .

U.S. authorities are allowing China 's ZTE Corp. to resume some business with American companies , temporarily easing part of a ban imposed over the tech giant 's exports to Iran and North Korea .
The Commerce Department 's order this week follows a settlement under which ZTE agreed to pay a $ 1 billion fine , replace its executive team and hire U.S. compliance officers .
The order said ZTE will be allowed to conduct business with American companies to maintain existing telecom networks and mobile phones and to support security features . The suspension lasts through Aug. 1 .
ZTE suspended most operations after it was banned in April from buying U.S. components and technology . The company had been paying American suppliers an estimated $ 1.8 billion annually .
DURHAM , N.C. ( CBSNewYork/AP ) — Hall of Fame Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski is stepping away from the team to have lower back surgery .
The school announced Monday that the procedure is scheduled for Friday , with an anticipated recovery time of four weeks .
Krzyzewski will coach Wednesday night 's game against Georgia Tech before handing off to associate head coach Jeff Capel for Saturday 's home game against Boston College .
Krzyzewski , 69 , will have a fragment of a herniated disk removed at Duke University Hospital . The school says Krzyzewski tried several treatment options during the past month before deciding on surgery .
Krzyzewski said in a statement that they consulted with the university 's medical team and “ together , we have determined that surgery is the best course of action at this time. ” They say the Blue Devils will “ be in the capable hands ” of Capel and assistants Nate James and Jon Scheyer .
“ As soon as the doctors clear me to do so , I look forward to returning and giving our team 100 ( percent ) of my energy and attention , which is certainly something that they deserve , ” they said .
The winningest men 's coach in Division I history had four surgeries during the offseason to replace their left knee , repair their left ankle and fix a hernia . They squeezed those procedures into a busy summer in which they also led the U.S. Olympic team to the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro .
“ To be sure , the entire Duke community is supportive and eager to get Mike back as soon as possible , ” Duke athletic director Kevin White said . “ His health is paramount , and they will get the best possible care in the world by the Duke medical team . With the proper recovery time , we look forward to Mike doing what they do best — leading and teaching — very soon . ”
Capel — a former Duke guard who went 175-110 in nine years coaching at Virginia Commonwealth and Oklahoma — previously took over for Krzyzewski when they missed a trip to Georgia Tech last February because of dehydration and high blood pressure .
That victory in Atlanta marked the first time Krzyzewski did not travel with their team since the 1994-95 season , when they missed the final 19 games due to back surgery and exhaustion . Those Blue Devils went 4-15 during that span and became the last Duke team to miss the NCAA Tournament .
Monday 's announcement marks the latest twist in an already drama-filled season for a team voted No . 1 in the preseason on the strength of a lineup led by preseason AP All-American guard Grayson Allen and four immediate-impact freshmen .

On Saturday , the Blue Devils ( 12-2 ) were routed at Virginia Tech in the first game of Allen 's indefinite suspension for tripping yet another opponent . And those freshmen — Harry Giles , Jayson Tatum , Marques Bolden and Frank Jackson — have played in the same game only three times because of various injuries .
The Blue Devils dropped three spots to No . 8 — their lowest ranking of the season — in the AP Top 25 released Monday .

TAIPEI ( Taiwan News ) – A Japanese artist was left with the only their underpants after featuring in a variety show that required participants to remove Chinese items in the house .
With the purpose to find out exactly how many Chinese products are present in the typical Japanese family , a variety show in Japan decided to invite three experts in different categories , including household electric appliances , clothing and furniture , to examine all the items at the house of a male celebrity .
The mission of the experts was to identify every item that was made in China , and those which were found to be Chinese products would be taken outside of the house .
In total , 619 daily used items were found to be made in China , including a sofa , chair , desk , light bulb , oven , and kettle . Additionally , 13 out of 28 pairs of shoes were also discovered to be produced in China .
The Japanese expert explained that China is the world 's leader in garment technology . About 80 percent of Japanese clothes , as well as many famous clothing brands , are manufactured in China .
At the end of the show , the male celebrity was forced to take off their clothes and was left with only underwear as they were noticed wearing `` made-in-China '' clothes . They sarcastically said in Mandarin : `` It 's so humiliating . ''
The sacrifices of a whole generation of Lancashire people are to be honoured with a weekend of events .
November 11 , 2018 marks 100 years since the guns fell silent and the First World War ended .
Preston Pals forming up on the Flag Market on September 7 , 1914
To mark the momentous occasion , a concert is being planned for Preston , starring the famous Accrington military band .
The concert , called Lancashire Remembers , will be at Preston 's Guild Hall on Saturday , November 10 .
The East Lancashire Concert Band , previously known as the Accrington Old Band which played as volunteers marched away in 1914 , will lead the concert along with a 400-strong choir . Tributes will be paid to all those who lost their lives , including the Chorley Pals , Preston Pals and the Lancashire regiments .
Project Manager Anne Ellwood said : “ It 's a brilliant idea . Neil Holme came to me with it last November and I could n't say no .
I 've got friends in Accrington with direct links back to the First World War and the Accrington Pals so it 's nice to give something back to Lancashire .
“ I 've got friends in Accrington with direct links back to the First World War and the Accrington Pals so it 's nice to give something back to Lancashire . ”
Neil , who plays trumpet in the Band , got the idea for this around two years ago after the Band 's anniversary concert to mark the Battle of the Somme . It followed a concert in 2014 in recognition of the beginning of the war – making this year 's concert the third of three planned to commemorate the centenary .
Neil , 62 , from Ashton-on-Ribble , said : “ This is something that we have to do , really . It 's a one-off opportunity for people all over the county to come together . ”
The Accrington and Chorley Pals made up part of the East Lancashire Regiment , with friends and family from Lancashire 's communities joining together to fight overseas .
The communities were left devastated after the Battle of the Somme in 1916 , with 31 men from the Chorley Pals losing their lives in a single day , and a further three dying within the month .
A further 59 were wounded , making a total of 93 casualties from around 175 men from Chorley .
“ This is about people having awareness of the war and the sacrifices made , ” Anne explained . “ We should remember these historic events . The next generation needs to know about it . ”
The former Blackburn and Darwen Council worker added : “ The war shaped these communities across the county and if it helps raise awareness of the effect then our job is done .
“ It 's just an honour to be asked to help out . ”
Anne , a self-titled “ honorary Lancastrian ” having been born in Cardiff , took their husband of 26 years , Carl , to the Somme two years ago as part of their own history lesson .
“ When we got out there and saw all those graves , some with ages of 15 and 16-year-old boys , it shook me and my husband to the core , ” they said .
The concert is teaming up with Londridge-based Barnacre Road Primary School 's own memorial stage production at the Guild Hall on November 11 , which will see more than 700 children and adults take part .
And the school recently learned that more than 15,000 poppies have been knitted by people as far afield as Australia and Canada , with one person making 1,000 for the Longridge Schools Cluster Armistice Project , have been created for the production .
Head teacher Simon Wallis said : “ The response has been amazing . Support is coming from all over the country , from Hexham to Cornwall and we 've even had contributions from Australia and Canada . It 's incredible . The whole thing has snowballed and people have been incredible offering all sorts of help . It really is a community project . ”
Anne said : “ In recent years I think the younger generations are very much getting involved in this kind of services . ”
British heavyweight boxer and former world champion Tyson Fury , failed to turn up for their UK Anti-Doping hearing in London today ( Monday ) to cast further doubt on when they can return to the sport .
Fury , along with their cousin Hughie , tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone in February 2015 but were not charged by UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) until June 2016 .
During this 16-month gap , Fury had beaten Wladimir Klitschko in one of the sport 's great upsets in recent years .
A rematch with the Ukrainian , who won a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta was scheduled for July 2016 .
However , Fury withdrew from the fight on the same day the UKAD charge was announced , citing a sprained ankle .
Both Tyson and Hughie Fury have denied they took nandrolone , claiming the positive test was a result of eating a wild boar , which had not been castrated .
Fury 's case has been further complicated by the fact they tested positive for cocaine in September 2016 , which they said they were using to help deal with depression .
With the prospect of having their title belts stripped from them following the positive test for cocaine , Fury relinquished them voluntarily on October 12 , 2016 .
The British Boxing Board of Control ( BBBoC ) suspended their boxing license the following day .

Fury 's hearing was set to take place last August but was suspended in May due to a conflict of interest involving one of their lawyers .
The hearing , which starts today , will now listen to evidence for at least two days before making a decision , a process that usually takes several weeks .
Despite facing the prospect of a possible incoming suspension , Fury remains confident they will be fighting next year .
“ End of April , early May , ” Fury said .
“ I will be ready by that time , fit and strong .
“ The training plan is set up , so I will be ready by then . ”
If Fury does fight next year , their first opponent could be fellow Briton Tony Bellew , who shocked the boxing world by beating former world heavyweight champion David Haye in March .
OnTheWight has learnt this afternoon that South Boats IOW Ltd are closing their operation on the Isle of Wight .
The boat-building company based at Medina Yard have taken the decision to close the operation on the Isle of Wight , but continue operations at the Alicat Workboats Limited site in Great Yarmouth .
OnTheWight has been told that no staff will be transferred over to Alicat .
Strong boat-building heritage
The company 's Website boasts :
South Boats has a strong heritage of boat building and repair on the Isle of Wight . Latterly , South Boats IOW has given the company the commercial strength to expand its design portfolio and compete internationally in commercial and military and security sectors .
Our thoughts are with all affected by the closure .

On one end of the Disneyland Resort , the Summer of Heroes have landed , and on the other end buildings have gotten larger in “ Star Wars ” land .
Long lines greet visitors to Disney California Adventure 's new attraction “ Guardians of the Galaxy : Mission Breakout ! ” Morning visitors snatch up nearly all the Fastpasses early , with the standby line routinely having waits up to two hours .
Nearby , Groot , the tree-like character from the movie “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” visits as part of a photo opportunity , while at other times the characters of Star Lord , Peter Quill , and Gamora from the same movie hold a “ dance-off. ” Both occur in front of the attraction .
Down the street in Hollywood land , other Marvel characters such as Captain America , Spider-Man and Black Widow ( Natasha Romanoff ) , make appearances with Romanoff helping out in “ The Avengers Training Initiative. ” That show is similar to the Jedi Training Academy at Disneyland , but with a “ Marvel ” approach to participation by kids .
At Disneyland , the Big Thunder Trail opened ; providing an alternate route between Fantasyland and Frontierland .
In Frontierland , the Mark Twain Riverboat and Sailing Ship Columbia were sailing the Rivers of America again , undergoing testing as the park edges closer to opening the attractions to the public .
The return of the ships to the waterway means that sometime this summer will also see the return of the river show “ Fantasmic ! ”
Disneyland also started work on a project meant to ease congestion in Adventureland . The work entails moving the dining area for the Bengal Barbecue into space occupied by two merchandise shops . Stroller parking , currently in the middle of the land 's walkway , will also be moved into the area occupied by a third shop – Tropical Imports . Work on the project is to be complete before the Fourth of July .
In Downtown Disney , steel girders were put in place for the building that will house the Splitsville Luxury Lanes , and several areas of the Grand Californian Hotel & Spa were undergoing refurbishment .

Eli Manning , Victor Cruz , Will Beatty , Zak DeOssie , and Jason Pierre-Paul .
That 's it .
That 's the total amount of players on the Giants ' roster who have playoff experience . And now that the regular season is out of the way , that factor looms ever larger as the NFC 's fifth-seeded team attempts to get past its wild-card game in Green Bay and mount a serious Super Bowl challenge .
Though surmountable , it 's no small matter , especially to a team that has forgotten the art of scoring points . The 19-10 victory in Washington may have the Giants feeling good about themselves from a defensive standpoint , and rightly so . But with Manning 's unit having failed to score even 20 points in its last five outings , the offense should be viewing Wild Card Weekend apprehensively .
It 's circumstances like these where a team needs those wise , seasoned heads on both sides of the ball to make clear to their teammates that the playoffs are like no other time of year .
Intensity rises exponentially . Players get just a little faster ; the emotional level elevates along with the stakes as the rounds go by .
The five who remain from the 2011 Super Bowl championship team , the last one to make the playoffs , know that . The question is whether that little nucleus can speak loud enough to convince the remaining 48 to kick up their games that extra level .
The leadership had no such issues in 2011 , or in Manning 's first Super Bowl run in 2007 . Plenty of Giants went into those miracle drives with at least a taste of playoff football .
Coach Tom Coughlin had taken the Giants to the postseason the two years previous to 2007 . Even though those gambits ended in losses — 23-0 to Carolina in 2005 and 23-20 in 2006 — the franchise returned much of those rosters in 2007 .
The defense and offense was packed with playoff experience . Manning was young , and Brandon Jacobs was at the height of their bruising prowess . Steve Smith and Plaxico Burress had seen the differences between life in the regular and postseasons . The offensive line was thoroughly hardened with David Diehl , Chris Snee , Shaun O'Hara , and Kareem McKenzie . Michael Strahan , Justin Tuck , Osi Umenyiora added voices for the defense , and Jeff Feagles , DeOssie , and miracle-catch man David Tyree handled the special teams .
That squad went into the playoffs with no fear of anyone .
By the time 2011 rolled around , Mario Manningham had come into the group , and Ahmad Bradshaw had the knowledge of a Super Bowl and the 23-11 , one-and-done exit against Philadelphia in 2008 .
The fact that the Giants find themselves in yet another situation where they must win three road games to reach the big show is nothing new . They were wild cards in both 2007 and 2011 .
But never was their core so inexperienced to the ways of the playoffs .
As well as the defense played — make no mistake , it carried the Giants this year — key free agent additions Janoris Jenkins , Olivier Vernon , Damon Harrison , and Kelvin Shepard have never sniffed the playoffs . As fiercely as Landon Collins has performed , they have but two years of total experience . To him , studying the Giants ' last playoff appearance would be like perusing an ancient manuscript .
Ditto for Odell Beckham , Jr. , the team 's only true offensive weapon .

Four years of watching from the living room has prompted major roster renovations . The passage of time caused retirements and departures .
What is left is an aging quarterback in Manning , an old long-snapper in DeOssie , a wide receiver who injuries and circumstances has relegated to second-class status in Cruz , a defensive lineman whose hernia surgery makes them an iffy proposition to even play in Pierre-Paul , and an offensive lineman who no longer plays at all in Beatty .
Postseason leadership is only part of the equation , of course . But it helps . And given the way the Giants insist on keeping opponents in games this season , they will need to utilize every facet to the fullest .
Deep down , players know playoff life is different . But they still need the experienced voices to bubble that realization to the surface , where it can translate into action .
Whether the Giants have enough of those to accomplish that could mean the difference between another pulse-pounding Super Bowl run and an early exit next weekend .

Migrants rescued from Sahara Desert
The plight of people as they try to escape war , famine and economic hardship and try to find a better life forces them to take riosks such as walking across the Sahara Desert in blazing heat . The story of this group is happier than many others .
The group of 92 migrants was rescued by the Niger Army in the north of the country , already seriously dehydrated and on the verge of death . The group , including women and children , was abandoned by traffickers without food or water . One of the group died after being taken to a treatment center .
Two weeks ago a group of 40 migrants died of thirst after their truck broke down on the route to Libya then across the Mediterranean . In this case the migrants were abandoned near a well and so the majority survived .
The traffickers pack them into trucks like cattle with little water and often in the middle of the desert , they ask for more money and if they do not pay , they are abandoned . Tens of thousands make the perilous journey each year across the Sahara . How many bodies lie under the sands ?

The good news is that you can easily manage diabetes and live a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle .
“ Many of the behaviors that can help control diabetes are ones we all should follow , ” said Dr. Andrea Gelzer , chief medical officer for AmeriHealth Caritas , a national leader in health care solutions for those in need . “ Some basic lifestyle changes can both control diabetes and improve your health in other ways . ”
Here are some common tips for managing diabetes :
Watch your numbers
It is important to watch your weight , blood pressure and cholesterol numbers . But the most important metrics in diabetes are your blood sugar and A1C levels – A1C is a measure of your blood sugar level over the past three months . Ask your primary care provider ( PCP ) and/or endocrinologist ( a doctor who specializes in diabetes and other diseases of the endocrine system ) about how to check your blood sugar and how often to do so . They can also work with your health insurance plan to help you obtain the needed supplies .
Eat smart
You should develop a healthy meal plan that includes :
Foods lower in calories , saturated fat , trans fat , sugar , and salt . Foods with more fiber , such as whole grain cereals , breads , crackers , rice , or pasta . Fresh fruits and vegetables . Low-fat or skim milk and water instead of juice and soda .
Get moving
Increasing your physical activity can help you get to and maintain a healthy weight . You should set a goal to be more active most days of the week . One possible approach is to start slowly by taking a 10-minute walk three times a day .
Take care of your eyes , mouth and feet
It may surprise you that your vision , mouth and feet can be indicators of uncontrolled diabetes . Make sure you brush and floss every day to keep your teeth and gums healthy . Check your feet for cuts , blisters , red spots , and swelling . And contact your PCP if you experience blurred or otherwise impaired vision .
Obtain routine health care
Keep scheduled visits with your PCP and other physicians to help find and treat any problems early . At each visit , be sure you have a :

The mill on Brennan 's Creek in Old Killaloe has been there since 1870 . Owner Anette Clough says it 's part country home , part storehouse of history .
`` It has a pile of stuff in there : Manual wooden planes , sickles , big wagon wheels , things that fit around a horse 's neck . '' There is equipment for sending flour down a chute into bags , and flour sifters , all pushed to one side of the building .
The other side is renovated : a three-bedroom home on the top two levels , and a smaller apartment with a separate entrance .
They and their soon-to-be ex-husband bought it about four years ago . The couple eventually split ; they moved out two years ago and their husband left last fall . The mill has been unoccupied since then .
`` I would love , love , love to keep the place . It 's an incredible building . I would really love to turn it into a bed and breakfast , '' they said Monday .
Previous owners blasted out bedrock and put in a 50-kilowatt turbine that generates electricity for sale to the provincial grid . At least it did until a flood three years ago . Clough figures the turbine itself is still fine , but the turbine room may need electrical repairs .
`` We almost had it ready to turn on , we had all the electricals checked and cleaned , and then we got flooded three years ago . And that is because we did n't have enough stop logs pulled out of the dam , '' they said .
With the couple splitting up , they ca n't afford to invest more money in repairs that are needed in one foundation wall , or in putting the turbine system back into shape .
It 's a lovely setting , with a pond behind the dam , walking trails and a foot bridge to the far side of the creek .
`` I have n't put it on the market yet because I have n't been wanting to sell it because I really love it . But looking at what happened this year ... ''
Last week , the rising runoff water spilled past the dam and through the first floor of the mill , in one door and out another .
Clough said a structural engineer looked at the mill since then , recommending repairs to one foundation wall and an overall review of the building when water levels drop .
Stop logs work like plugs in a drain , meaning they can be dropped into position in a dam or lifted out to control how much water can flow through . They are intended to be lifted out in fall , so that the spring flood has an opening where it can rush right through . But the logs are heavy , and Clough and their husband could n't remove them all last fall , so the dam was partially blocked . Then spring came .
The result is familiar to anyone who has tried to flush a blocked toilet : Water backs up and overflows . It 's now receding .
The Killaloe Post , an online magazine that 's largely the work of local photographer Lynn Flokstra , recently traced the history of the mill that was built by an Irish immigrant in 1849 , and rebuilt after a major fire in 1870 .
`` At its peak the mill was powered by one wood- and one water-powered engine and was in operation 24 hours a day grinding the wheat harvest for local farmers , '' the Post notes . `` When flour was no longer profitable they ground grain for livestock feed . With the rise of national commercial mills local grain milling became a thing of the past . ''
The mill had a second life sawing and planing lumber from the 1940s until 1968 .
If no one maintains the building , Clough says , `` it could get worse , and then the town and the area lose something that has been there forever and is really amazing . ''

LOS ANGELES — Charlie Sheen dropped their lawsuit against the National Enquirer over a November article that alleged the actor raped then-child star Corey Haim in the 1980s .
Lawyers for Sheen filed court papers Thursday with Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gregory Keosian seeking dismissal of the case . The documents did not state whether a settlement was reached or if Sheen is not pursuing the case for other reasons .
The suit , filed Dec. 8 , said the allegations were particularly offensive because Sheen has five children and some of them were the same age as was Haim . Haim died in 2010 at the age of 38 . Their mother said in an interview that they did not believe Sheen had raped them son .
The Enquirer reported that Sheen , then about 19 , sexually assaulted 13-year-old Haim on the set of the 1986 film “ Lucas. ” The tabloid quoted Haim 's friend , Dominick Brascia , as saying Haim and Sheen smoked pot and had anal sex .
Sheen , now 52 , denied the allegations .
Brascia was named as one of the suit 's defendants , as was Dylan Howard , chief content officer of American Media Inc. , the Enquirer 's parent company .
American Media said in a previous statement that the company was looking forward to fighting Sheen 's suit .
“ ( We ) ca n't wait to expose their depravities in a court of law , ” the tabloid said .
A snow volleyball exhibition is planned for Pyeongchang to help the sport 's international governing body make the case for it to be added to the Olympics .
If successful , volleyball would be the first sport to be on the program at both the Winter and Summer Games .
Snow volleyball is similar to the beach discipline , with two-person teams . With many of the tournaments hosted by ski resorts as a diversion for their guests , it also borrows the party atmosphere of the sandy side of the sport .
But those who have played it say the cold and snow are new challenges that make it a very different sport .
The exhibition on Feb. 14 at the Austria House will include Olympic medalists from the beach and indoor disciplines , as well as South Korean players .
There are already 17 European countries hosting national snow volleyball championships and a tour that will culminate in an inaugural European championship in Austria in March .

In some ways , Rachel Freier has a background that might be expected in a new civil court judge . They are a real estate lawyer who volunteers in family court and in their community , where they even serve as a paramedic .
But Freier starts work Tuesday as something quite unexpected . She 's believed to be the first woman from Judaism 's ultra-Orthodox Hasidic community to be elected as a judge in the United States .
A proud product of a world with strict customs concerning gender roles and modesty , the new Brooklyn civil court judge started college as a married , 30-year-old mother of three children and had three more before graduating . A pathbreaker who embraces tradition , they have sometimes had to explain themselves to both outsiders and fellow believers .
`` My commitment to the public and my commitment to my religion and my community — the two can go hand in hand , '' they say .
At a swearing-in ceremony last month , they both vowed to uphold the Constitution and pledged to illuminate the Hasidic world for their new colleagues .
`` This is a dream , '' they told the gathering . `` It 's the American dream . ''
There 's no official tally of American judges ' religions , but experts are n't aware of any Hasidic woman before Freier winning a judicial post . It is extremely rare even in Israel for Hasidic or other ultra-Orthodox women to hold any elected position .
Freier , a political newcomer whose uncle is a former judge , won a three-way Democratic primary and the general election in a swath of Brooklyn that includes the heavily Hasidic Borough Park neighborhood .
Them election is `` a step for the ultra-Orthodox community at large , '' showing it 's open to women making progress on the political ladder , said Yossi Gestetner , a longtime Hasidic political activist and public relations consultant who co-managed Freier 's campaign .
Hasids and other ultra-Orthodox groups together make up only 6 percent of America 's estimated 5.3 million adult Jews , according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study .
Dating to 18th-century Eastern Europe , Hasidism combines stringent adherence to Jewish law and a joyful belief in mysticism . Followers often speak Yiddish , wear traditional dress including beards and sidelocks for men and wigs for married women , and separate men and women in contexts ranging from buses to classrooms .
`` The very idea that an ultra-Orthodox woman could be a judge '' is notable , said Samuel Heilman , a City University of New York sociology professor who studies Orthodox Judaism . Under the strictest interpretations of Jewish law , women ca n't be judges or largely even witnesses in the rabbinical courts that weigh various disputes in Orthodox communities . ( Freier notes that their new post is separate from those tribunals . )
Freier , 51 , nicknamed Ruchie , started working as a legal secretary after high school . College was n't customary for Hasidic women , though it has since become more common .
But when their husband , David , got a college degree , they aspired to one of their own . After graduating from a women-only , Orthodox Jewish-friendly program at private Touro College , they went on to Brooklyn Law School , finishing in 2005 .
Some other Hasidic Jews questioned what they were doing . But they came to realize `` I was completely devoted to our religion and our tradition , and this was something I wanted to do regardless , '' they say .
`` I did n't want to ever be considered someone who was turning away from my community , '' but rather to work within its structure , they said .
That has sometimes required finding creative ways to resolve issues .
An appeal for help from boys who had chafed in Orthodox Jewish schools , for example , led Freier to found a program that helps young men get general-equivalency diplomas .
Then Freier was enlisted to represent Orthodox Jewish women who wanted to join an all-male volunteer ambulance corps , aiming to aid fellow women during childbirth or gynecological emergencies .
After ambulance corps leaders rebuffed the idea , which a well-known Orthodox Jewish blog called a `` new radical feminist agenda , '' Freier helped the women launch their own volunteer service and joined it herself . They were still taking their turn on call this past week .
If there 's a message they hope their election sends , it 's `` do n't give up . ''
`` And do n't let go of your standards . ''
Neu beat DFL candidate Laurie Warner by 6 percentage points in the Valentine 's Day election , carrying 53 percent of the vote to Warner 's 47 percent . It was the first Republican-held seat up for election since Trump 's Jan. 20 inauguration .
Ordinarily , Neu would have been heavily favored to win — Trump took about 60 percent of the district 's vote in November . But with special elections often unpredictable , Republicans did n't take anything for granted .
`` I 'm grateful to Chisago County residents for their support and trust to be their new voice in the legislature , '' Neu said in an emailed statement . `` I 'm eager to roll up my sleeves and get to work with my House colleagues working to make health care more affordable , cut taxes for families , and build a budget that respects Minnesota taxpayers . ''
Neu 's victory gives Republicans a 20-seat majority in the Minnesota House , their second-largest in the modern era .
THE WINNER
Neu 's victory marks a step out into the limelight for a woman who has long worked behind the scenes on political campaigns .
`` I never really saw myself on this side of an election , '' said Neu , a Republican activist and campaign worker . `` When this opportunity came ... I thought , it 's time . It 's time for me to do this in a different way , to step up and try to be an advocate for the people of Chisago County and for conservative values . ''
They say she 'll focus on cutting taxes and trying to improve Minnesota 's individual health insurance market , where premiums have soared in recent years .
By winning , Neu beat Warner in their second bid for the District 32B seat . A former Duluth City Council member before moving to North Branch a decade ago , Warner 's top campaign issue was increasing school funding .
Both candidates raised and spent more than $ 25,000 on their campaigns , according to reports filed with the state Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board . Most of their spending went to mail sent to voters ' homes .
AN UNUSUAL ELECTION
Tuesday 's election came about because of an unusual situation . Just two months before the November 2016 general election , the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that incumbent Rep. Bob Barrett did n't live in the district and was ineligible to run .
Because the decision came so close to the election , there was n't enough time under state law to replace Barrett on the ballot . Instead , the Supreme Court ruled that the November election would n't count for District 32B . The seat would remain vacant until February .
District 32B has been comfortably Republican in recent elections . Barrett beat Warner by 10 points in 2014 . In both 2014 and 2016 , other Republican candidates up and down the ballot won by similar margins . But it 's not impossible for Democrats to win there in a favorable environment : In 2012 , Barrett squeaked out a victory by fewer than 2 percentage points , and DFL Sen. Amy Klobuchar won in a landslide .
TURNOUT LOW , BUT BETTER
Tuesday 's special election saw about 25 percent of the district 's registered voters vote — much lower than the November election , when about 70 percent of registered voters in the district cast ballots .
That lower turnout is normal for special elections , since they take place at unusual times of the year and do n't coincide with higher-profile state and national races . This can make special elections less predictable than normal races .
But Tuesday 's race was n't a normal special election . Because it was technically a continuation of the November election , people who voted early or absentee in November were automatically sent ballots for Tuesday .
So 25 percent of District 32B voters was actually much higher than the turnout in a pair of special elections last February , when between 10 percent and 20 percent of voters cast ballots .
Breitbart News has a target in its crosshairs following the departure of former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn from the White House in a cascade of scandal over their contacts with the Russian government : White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus .
Targeting Priebus , who leads the faction of Trump aides that is composed of experienced establishment political hands , is really just a stand-in for a larger conflict about the future of Trumpism in the White House . Breitbart News is treating Flynn 's ouster as the first salvo in a war against those in the administration they deem insufficiently loyal to Trump . Backing up Breitbart are legions of other Trump loyalists in the right-wing media sphere . And their angry reaction to Flynn 's exit signals the unpopularity of the move with a vocal segment of Trump 's base .
Trump loyalists — meaning the true believers who supported Trump from the start , not Republican politicos who became attached later on — have been privately musing about getting rid of Priebus . Now , that musing is going public . “ I think this is Pearl Harbor for the true Trump supporters , the Trump loyalists , ” said Roger Stone , a former Trump campaign adviser and longtime Republican operative who still has a relationship with Trump . “ I believe Reince Priebus moved on General Flynn and I think they intend to move on Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller next . They are not serving the president well . The people they hired are loyal to the Republican National Committee , not the President of the United States . ”
Recommended : Why Flynn 's Resignation Matters
At Breitbart , the right-wing outlet that until recently was run by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and has served as a loyal defender of Trumpism , the narrative was set early with a piece by editor-at-large Joel Pollak questioning the role of U.S. intelligence agencies in the leaks that brought down Flynn . Pollak and other Trump defenders are arguing that the real story is the fact of the leaks themselves , and not what was leaked .
“ The fourth and most worrying explanation is that the government was not merely monitoring the communications of Russian diplomats , but of the Trump transition team itself , ” Pollak wrote . “ The fact that the contents of Flynn 's phone conversation—highly sensitive intelligence—were leaked to the media suggests that someone with access to that information also has a political axe to grind . ”
( Pollak 's argument mirror 's Trump 's own message , delivered in a tweet on Tuesday morning : “ The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington ? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc ? ” )
Tuesday morning , Breitbart 's Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle—an ardent Trump supporter and known ally of Bannon—came out with a splashy scoop : “ As Flynn Resigns , Priebus Future In Doubt As Trump Allies Circulate List of Alternate Chief of Staff Candidates . “
Boyle 's story cites “ sources close to the president ” and “ multiple sources close to President Trump with internal knowledge of White House operations ” blaming Priebus for not moving cabinet confirmations along quickly enough and for the “ botched rollout ” of Trump 's controversial executive order banning people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States . The order and subsequent fallout threw into stark relief the contrast between the Bannon-esque and more traditional wings of the White House ; the staffer who bore most of the blame publicly was Stephen Miller , the White House senior policy adviser who played a key role in the travel ban and who has close relationships with Breitbart reporters dating back to the effort to scuttle the Senate Gang of 8 immigration reform bills in 2013 .

The story accuses Priebus of knowing about anti-Trump “ sleeper cells ” hidden throughout the government .
“ White House and other government sources say there are as many as 50 of them throughout government , and Priebus has full knowledge of their whereabouts , who they are , and what potential for damage they may cause , ” Boyle reported . “ He is not doing anything about it , these sources add . ”
Purging “ sleeper cells ” of non-political government employees would be illegal , according to Richard Painter , former chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush , and former Obama White House ethics czar Norm Eisen .

SAN DIEGO ( AP ) -- Franchy Cordero and Hunter Renfroe , teammates in the Pacific Coast League last season , combined to drive in all of the San Diego Padres ' runs in a 4-2 , sweep-clinching victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday .
Renfroe hit their 14th home run , a two-run shot that tied the score 2-2 in the sixth inning , and Cordero hit a tie-breaking single in the seventh before Renfroe 's RBI groundout finished the surge .
'' I know exactly what Franchy 's all about , and he 's done everything I expected of them since they came up , '' Renfroe said of their fellow rookie .
Padres starter Jhoulys Chacin ( 6-5 ) pitched seven innings , allowing five hits and two runs .
Reds reliever Michael Lorenzen ( 3-2 ) inherited a 2-2 score from starter Amir Garrett and began the seventh with two walks , leading to two runs .
The Reds , who have lost their past nine road games , were swept at both Dodger Stadium and Petco Park to go 0-6 on the West Coast trip .
The left-handed hitting Cordero hit three home runs over the first two games of the series .
They had two singles in the finale . The second , a groundball to right field , scored Matt Szczur , who had drawn a leadoff walk against Lorenzen as a pinch-hitter .
The RBI single came after Cordero mistakenly attempted to bunt , causing third-base coach Glenn Hoffman to tell them to swing away .
'' We made sure that they got the message that we trusted their bat , '' manager Andy Green said .
Green said Cordero , who made their major league debut May 27 as a replacement for injured center fielder Manuel Margot , was `` being selfless '' when they tried to bunt , but the smarter play was to swing because Lorenzen is a strikeout pitcher .
Green said the advice to Renfroe was to be patient .
'' Hunter Renfroe does not need to cheat to get to any pitch , '' Green said .
Renfroe hit Garrett 's 88 mph fastball 429 feet into the top of the second deck to score Yangervis Solarte and tie Nate Colbert for the most home runs by a Padres rookie before the All-Star break . Colbert went on to hit 24 home runs in that expansion season , 1969 .
Brandon Mauer recorded their 12th save in 14 tries after Brad Hand threw a scoreless eighth .
The Reds rediscovered their home run prowess , getting solo shots from Jose Peraza and Joey Votto after not adding to the team 's majors-leading home run total in the series ' first and second games .
Peraza hit Chacin 's second pitch of the game into the left-field seats for the team 's first leadoff homer of the season . For Peraza , it was their third home run .
Votto cleared the wall in right-center field for their 19th homer .
Garrett took a 2-0 lead into the sixth before Solarte singled and Renfroe blasted the lefty 's 91st pitch of the afternoon .
The lefty starter , 25 , brought in an ERA of 7.40 .
'' This was a great step , '' Reds manager Bryan Price said . '' He 's a great kid , he 's a great worker , everybody pulls for Amir to do well , and I think that was certainly a step in the right direction because they were throwing three pitches over the plate for strikes and they were on the attack . ''
HIGHLIGHT DEFENSE
Prompting applause from Garrett , three Reds defenders teamed up to nab Erick Aybar trying to score from first on Luis Torrens ' second-inning double .
Center fielder Arismendy Alcantara threw to second baseman Scooter Gennett , who threw to catcher Tucker Barnhart . Video review upheld the outcall of plate umpire Ted Barrett .
TRAINER 'S ROOM
Reds : Zack Cosart , who went into Wednesday as the leading vote-getter at shortstop for the All-Star Game , was out of the starting lineup with a quad injury for the second day in a row . They were pulled from Monday 's lopsided game due to the quad .
Padres : RHP Trevor Cahill is expected to throw bullpen sessions on the upcoming trip and then begin a minor league assignment .
UP NEXT
Reds : RHP Tim Adelman ( 4-2 , 4.34 ) on Friday will face the Los Angeles Dodgers in Cincinnati after going 2-0 with 2.08 ERA in their past four starts .
Padres : RHP Miguel Diaz , who made 21 relief appearance this year , will make their second career start Friday against the Milwaukee Brewers in San Diego . In their first start , last Saturday against the Kansas City Royals , the rookie was unable to get an out in the third inning .
Noted aviator and actor Harrison Ford flew their private plane over a jet airliner on the ground at a Southern California airport Monday . It 's not the first time the Star Wars and Indiana Jones star has had problems landing .
The 74-year-old Ford was instructed to land on a runway at Orange County 's John Wayne Airport but mistakenly landed on a parallel taxiway , passing over a Boeing 737 carrying 110 passengers and six crew members .
On a recording , Ford asked air traffic controllers , `` Was that airliner meant to be underneath me ? '' according to NBC News , which first reported the incident .
Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson Ian Gregor said the pilot heard and read back the correct landing instructions , according to The Associated Press . Gregor did not confirm it was Ford who was piloting the plane , a single-engine Aviat Husky . The AP reports that they did n't say how close Ford 's plane came to hitting the jet on the ground .
No one was injured and the jet , American Airlines Flight 1456 , took off for Dallas shortly after without incident .
The FAA is now investigating , which `` could result in a simple warning letter to a suspension of Ford 's pilot 's license , '' NBC reports .
Ford collects vintage planes and has been flying for decades . According to NPR 's Russell Lewis , Ford is `` a highly-skilled and highly-rated pilot . He 's qualified to fly single and twin engine planes , seaplanes , helicopters and he 's also an instrument-rated pilot . '' In 2015 , Ford said they owned `` eight or nine various types of airplanes , '' according to NTSB documents posted on AirSafe.com .
Ford reported on a medical certificate application that they had logged at least 5,200 flight hours , according to the NTSB .
They were a 2008 honoree and received the Legends Aviation Legacy Award from Kiddie Hawk Air Academy , and subsequently had an award named after him .
Ford was seriously injured in March 2015 when they crash-landed a restored World War II-era trainer plane on a golf course near the Santa Monica Airport shortly after takeoff . A National Transportation Safety Board report found the crash was caused by a loose engine part .
In 2000 , Ford 's plane `` departed '' a runway in Lincoln , Neb. , because of a gust of wind , according to AirSafe.com . They were flying a Beechcraft Bonanza which `` sustained minor damage , '' though Ford and their passenger were not injured .
And in 1999 they crash-landed a helicopter during a training flight in Ventura County , near Los Angeles , according to the AP . `` Although the helicopter rolled over on its left side , neither Ford nor the instructor were injured , '' AirSafe.com notes .
NEW YORK ( AP ) — A $ 25 million pledge to fight the food industry 's influence on public health is coming from a surprising source — the CEO of a snack bar maker .
Kind founder Daniel Lubetzky says he 's pledging their own money to create a group called `` Feed the Truth '' dedicated to revealing corporate influence in the nutrition field , with activities like education campaigns and investigative journalism .
The move underscores the division between older `` Big Food '' companies and newer businesses that market themselves as wholesome alternatives aligned with health advocates . Kind , known for its fruit and nut bars , touts its use of `` real '' ingredients and has proven deft at mixing marketing with nutrition issues .
A public health and ethics expert not involved with the group says much depends on how it is set up , and that one tactic to neutralize potential critics is to engage them .
Three high-profile health and nutrition experts have been enlisted to name Feed the Truth 's board , which will hire an executive director . Lubetzky said they and Kind will have no involvement , and the group will be free to scrutinize the company . `` We do n't have any skeletons in our closet , '' they said .
Since Kind was launched in 2004 , the company 's annual revenue has grown to $ 673.4 million , according to market researcher Euromonitor .
The company was in the spotlight after the Food and Drug Administration warned that it was inappropriately using the term `` healthy '' on packaging . Kind launched a petition asking the FDA to update its guidelines , saying the fat in almonds and avocados should n't count against it , and declared victory when the agency said last year it was re-evaluating .
Lubetzky cited that experience and recent reporting by The Associated Press and The New York Times revealing the food industry 's influence on nutrition science for their decision to create Feed the Truth . Kind said they will sign a letter of intent to donate $ 2.5 million a year for the next 10 years .
Lubetzky said they did not donate the money to the Center for Science in the Public Interest because the advocacy group does not accept industry funding . That raises the question of whether Feed the Truth will accept money from other food companies , and if so , under what terms . Lubetzky said that will be up to the board and director .
The irony of such a group being established by a snack bar CEO is not lost on Marion Nestle , a professor of food studies at New York University who is helping nominate the board . They said they usually keep industry at arm 's length , but found Lubetzky `` very persuasive '' and felt Feed the Truth could raise awareness about corporate influence in nutrition research .
Deb Eschmeyer , a senior policy adviser on nutrition under the Obama administration , said the project reflects the new ways companies and executives are engaging with the public . Michael Jacobson , executive director of CSPI , said the money being pledged in advance should help give the group independence .
Kind said the three advisers are not being paid , though it covered Nestle 's travel costs for a meeting . The company said it would not be involved once the board is established .
Leigh Turner , a professor at the University of Minnesota 's School of Public Health , said that whether the group remains free from Lubetzky and Kind 's influence remains to be seen . They noted that engaging critics is one way for companies to neutralize them , and that the group could be a boon to Kind 's image .
`` This is a business that wants to present itself as a healthy alternative to candy bars , '' Turner said .
As an example of how Kind presents itself , the company launched a `` Nutrition Collective '' for dietitians last year , which it said was for discussion of major public health issues . A signup page said members would not be paid , but being involved included letting people how `` Kind can be a part of their new lifestyle . ''
Although Feed the Truth may boost Kind 's image , Lubetzky said that was n't the goal .
`` I would hope that people say , OK , these guys are doing the right thing for society , I 'm going to be more loyal to the brand , '' Lubetzky said .

The gun lobby 's concession on bump stocks was barely a concession at all – but it may go some way to satisfy those demanding action after Las Vegas

After the deadliest mass shooting in recent American history , the National Rifle Association has agreed it might be appropriate to regulate a dumb toy that can also be used as a weapon of mass carnage .
The NRA 's concession , heralded as a breakthrough , is so small it is hard to see with the naked eye . The gun rights group broke its silence on the Las Vegas shooting Thursday as media reports suggested Republican members of Congress might support a ban on “ bump stocks ” , a device that allows semi-automatic rifles to mimic the rapid fire of a fully automatic weapon . Officials confirmed that Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock had 12 rifles fitted with bump stocks in the hotel suite they used to stage their attack .
It is not clear how closely the Republicans and NRA coordinated on Thursday , but they moved in quick succession .
“ Clearly , that 's something we need to look into , ” the House speaker , Paul Ryan , said in a television interview early on Thursday , noting that they had never heard of bump stocks before .
At 2.14pm , the NRA sent out a press blast suggesting that bump stocks “ should be subject to additional regulations ” , and calling for more review .
At about 2.30pm , the White House press secretary , Sarah Sanders , said during a briefing that “ we 're certainly open to having that conversation ” on regulating bump stocks .
Rather than endorsing a law banning the devices , as Democratic gun control advocates proposed , the NRA said in its statement on Thursday that it was asking the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) , which had repeatedly ruled that bump stocks did not fall under the regulation of federal firearms statutes , to review its decision .
This is a “ pretty small giveback ” but “ may go a long way to placating people who are demanding action after Las Vegas , ” said Robert Spitzer , a gun politics expert at State University of New York at Cortland .
“ If this can be changed through a simple administrative ruling from the ATF , you do n't even have to go to Congress to get a law passed . That would be a little plus from the NRA 's point of view , ” Spitzer said . “ Their basic political default position is no new gun laws . It would n't be a new gun law . ”
Even NRA members , Spitzer added , regard bump stocks as having no legitimate use . “ I think even the gun people on the inside are saying , ‘ Why would you bother to even defend this stupid thing ? ' ” they said .
In a Thursday night interview with Fox News ' Tucker Carlson , the NRA 's chief lobbyist , Chris Cox , said that “ the American people are struggling . They 're grieving . And so are the five million members of the National Rifle Association . ”
NRA members had been among those shot and killed in the Las Vegas attack on a country music festival , Cox said . “ The American people are looking for answers , and so are we . ”
When asked about bump stocks , which Carlson called “ ludicrous ” , Cox said : “ We did n't talk about banning anything . ”
They added : “ There are not a whole lot of people who own these things . ”
Dave Kopel , a gun law expert and gun rights advocate , said it was possible that the ATF might be able to reconsider the decision , but that such a reversal might be tricky . “ It might be better to update the statute and say that any device that makes a normal gun fire as fast a machine gun should have to go through the same process as buying a machine gun , ” they said .
Having Congress update the 1934 National Firearms Act would be preferable to Senator Dianne Feinstein 's bump stock ban legislation , Kopel said , which was too broad and might fuel an underground market in bump stocks by not providing any way for current owners to register them legally .
Kopel , who has been a gun rights expert and author for decades , noted that they had never heard of bump stocks before this week .
Two of the most prominent online companies that sell bump stocks , Bump Fire Systems and Slide Fire Solutions , are based in Moran , Texas and sell variations on a single product for different models of semi-automatic rifle . Neither appears to be a major gun industry player , though bump stocks do appear to be a significant part of the industry in Moran , which has a population of about 350 people .
If their business had to close , “ It would hurt the whole town , the school . We pay a very large amount of property taxes , ” Jeremiah Cottle , the 40-year-old owner of Slide Fire Solutions , said in a brief interview with the Dallas Morning News .
At one point Slide Fire Solutions had employed about a 10th of the town 's population , according to the Dallas Morning News .
Slide Fire Solutions and Bump Fire Systems shared a similar online message on Friday : “ We have decided to temporarily suspend taking new orders in order to provide the best service with those already placed. ” Bump Fire Systems also noted on its website : “ Due to extremely high demands , we have temporarily stopped taking orders . ”
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Soaring stock prices under President Donald Trump have boosted investor portfolios and corporate profits but have not eased the economic anxieties of middle-class families , Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III said Tuesday night in the Democratic response to Trump 's first State of the Union address .
In calling on Americans to reject the `` chaos '' of the Trump era , Kennedy also outlined a Democratic vision that promises a `` better deal for all who call this country home . ''
Democrats support a higher minimum wage , paid leave for employees and affordable child care , among other priorities , Kennedy said .
`` We choose pensions that are solvent , trade pacts that are fair , roads and bridges that wo n't rust away , and good education you can afford , '' they said in a speech from a vocational high school in Fall River , Massachusetts , a onetime manufacturing hub now struggling with high unemployment and other problems .
Kennedy , 37 , a three-term member of congress and grandson of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , has argued that Democrats should focus on the economic concerns of working-class voters who bolted the party in the 2016 elections .
Fall River , home to many blue-collar workers , `` has faced its share of storms , '' Kennedy said . `` But people here are tough . They fight for each other . They pull for their city . ''
In an apparent reference to Trump , Kennedy said that `` bullies may land a punch '' and leave a mark but that they have `` never managed to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future . ''
In a hard-hitting speech for a political newcomer , Kennedy decried a rollback of civil rights protections , noting proposals that target Muslims , transgender people and others .
The Trump administration `` is n't just targeting the laws that protect us — they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection , '' Kennedy said .
Trump 's record is `` a rebuke of our highest American ideal : the belief that we are all worthy , we are all equal and we all count — in the eyes of our law and our leaders , our God and our government , '' Kennedy said .
The red-haired Kennedy was elected to the House in 2012 , returning the family to Congress two years after the retirement of Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy , the son of Joe Kennedy III 's great-uncle Ted .
Known mostly for their famous last name , Kennedy 's selection has been criticized by some as tone-deaf at a time when sexual harassment of women and the Black Lives Matter movement are at the forefront of American politics . Speaking without a suit coat in front of a rebuilt car and an enthusiastic audience , Kennedy tried to defuse that Tuesday by citing the # MeToo movement and declaring , `` Black lives matter . ''
In a nod to `` Dreamers , '' the 700,000 young immigrants brought here as children and now here illegally , Kennedy spoke in Spanish as they said Dreamers are a part of America 's story and promised that Democrats will not walk away from them .
Kennedy said Trump and their administration were breaking a core promise of America — that everyone will be treated equally under the law . They accused the administration of `` callously '' appraising Americans ' worth and deciding `` who makes the cut and who can be bargained away . ''
Under the leadership of Trump and congressional Republicans , Americans are `` bombarded with one false choice after another , '' Kennedy said . `` Coal miners or single moms . Rural communities or inner cities . The coast or the heartland . ''
Democrats `` choose both , '' Kennedy said .
A former Peace Corps volunteer , Kennedy was an assistant district attorney in two Massachusetts districts before being elected to Congress . They have focused on economic and social justice in Congress and has advocated on behalf of vocational schools and community colleges and championed issues such as transgender rights and marriage equality .
To illustrate that message , Kennedy invited U.S. Army Staff Sgt . Patricia King , a transgender woman , as their guest to the State of the Union . King , an infantry squad leader at Fort Lewis , Washington , was the first person to have gender reassignment surgery paid for by the military .
Kennedy 's speech was one of several Democratic responses . Elizabeth Guzman , one of the first Latinas elected to the Virginia House of Delegates , delivered a Spanish-language response , while former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke on Facebook Live and Rep. Maxine Waters , D-Calif. , spoke on BET .

By Jonathan Stempel
( Reuters ) - A federal appeals court reduced by $ 2 million the legal fees that Sears Holdings Corp and Whirlpool Corp must pay to settle a class action lawsuit over defective washing machines . The reason : the case was not that complicated .
The 7th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Monday cut to $ 2.7 million from $ 4.77 million the sum owed to the plaintiffs ' lawyers .
Shoppers alleged that Whirlpool-manufactured front-loading washing machines they had bought at Sears , under the Whirlpool and Kenmore brands , were prone to failure because of defective control units and mold .
A lower court judge last September cited the `` presence of novel and complex legal issues '' as a factor to justify awarding the plaintiffs ' lawyers 1.75 times the base fees they charged . Such multipliers are common in class action settlements .
Circuit Judge Richard Posner , however , said the appeals court was `` puzzled '' by the `` questionable '' decision to award a multiplier , given that a case 's novelty and complexity was typically reflected in base fees .
The lower court judge `` concluded that for the most part the case was n't very complex - it was just about whether or not Sears had sold defective washing machines , '' Posner wrote .
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
The settlement followed nine years of litigation . Damages have not been determined , but Sears and Whirlpool have estimated that the total payout to class members may not exceed $ 900,000 .
In a joint statement , Sears and Whirlpool said the appeals court correctly reduced the `` excessive and unreasonable '' fee award , and said fees in similar cases should generally be lower than sums the plaintiffs recover .
The case is In re : Sears , Roebuck and Co Front-Loading Washer Products Liability Litigation , 7th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , No . 16-3554 .

Last week , the results of a hugely important Federal Communications Commission auction came out . The Commission was selling the rights to use re-purposed TV spectrum to wireless carriers , and T-Mobile spent $ 8 billion to buy far more spectrum than anyone else .
The spectrum being auctioned is particularly valuable low-band airwaves that work better in rural areas and indoors — two areas that T-Mobile has struggled with , compared to Verizon , which has long held the licenses to a large amount of low-band spectrum .

But a new analysis of the data shows that while T-Mobile might have spent far more than any other company in the auction , it was n't just a case of having a bigger purse . Spectrum was sold in seven 10MHz bands , and each band was available for a particular region . For example , T-Mobile could have bought Band G for use in Washington DC , but AT & T could have bought the rights to the same band in New York City .
Overall , T-Mobile spent nearly $ 8 billion to buy 1,525 licenses . AT & T spent just $ 910 million , but only acquired 23 licenses . As Fierce Wireless pointed out , that brings AT & T 's per-license spend to nearly $ 40 million , while T-Mobile spent just $ 5.2 million per license .
A lot of that difference is probably down to geography . As you can see from the maps from Mosaik included below , T-Mobile bought spectrum in every single market across the country , including a lot of rural areas that were less valuable . AT & T focused its spectrum buys around much more expensive areas , like the Philadelphia-DC metro area , Dallas , Seattle , and San Francisco .
Looking at the raw auction data from the FCC , this becomes even more clear . T-Mobile and AT & T paid exactly the same price in regions like New York , Chicago and San Francisco ; the difference is that AT & T did n't even bid on spectrum in Wahpeton , ND , where licenses were sold for $ 5,000 .
But on a strategic level , it 's still likely that history will show T-Mobile as the big winner from this auction . AT & T only invested in spectrum in urban areas where it already owns bandwidth , seeing it as a short-term way to alleviate network congestion . But in cities , spectrum is less likely to be a big deal in 20 years : solutions like LTE-U and Wi-Fi hotspots , deployed every couple hundred meters and inside buildings , are going to be the only way to handle overwhelming growth in the number of internet-connected devices .
So , AT & T paid through the nose for a short-term fix to network problems . T-Mobile , on the other hand , bought up new spectrum nationwide , in many cases in regions that are under-populated , and bought most of that spectrum for dirt-cheap . Just think about how Verizon is able to be competitive these days : it can charge a higher price for a network that 's only superior because of spectrum licenses it bought decades ago . In 20 years , AT & T might find itself ruing the day it decided Wahpeton , ND was n't worth $ 5,000 .

The owner of an Ohio gun range said Steve Stephens visited their facility just months before the Cleveland man allegedly posted a video of themselves fatally shooting an elderly man , according to a report . Blake Frederick , owner of Sherwin Shooting Sports gun range in Eastlake , Ohio , said Stephens visited their range often , ABC affiliate WEWS in Cleveland reported .
Stephens posted a video on Facebook in 2016 showing them shooting targets at the gun range , with the caption `` rapid shots , '' according to WEWS .
Stephens , who had a concealed carry permit , is at the center of a nationwide manhunt . They are suspected of killing Robert Godwin Sr. , 74 , on Sunday and uploading a video of the murder to Facebook , according to police in Cleveland .
The Associated Press
The social media platform also released the following timeline of events , according to its records :
11:09 a.m. PDT — First video , of intent to murder , uploaded . Not reported to Facebook .
11:11 a.m. PDT — Second video , of shooting , uploaded .

12:59 p.m. PDT — Video of shooting is first reported .
1:22 p.m. PDT — Suspect 's account disabled ; all videos no longer visible to public .
A Facebook executive on Monday said the company is reviewing some of its practices in light of the incident .
`` It was a horrific crime — one that has no place on Facebook , and goes against our policies and everything we stand for , '' Facebook VP of Global Operations Justin Osofsky said in a blog post late Monday . `` As a result of this terrible series of events , we are reviewing our reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible . ''
Stephens claimed to have committed multiple homicides , according to police , but no additional victims have been found .
Friends and family members of the victim gathered on Monday near the spot where Godwin died to remember him .
The Associated Press
Angela Smalls , who said Godwin is the father of two of their children , spoke at the event and pleaded for Stephens to turn themselves in .
`` He took my kids ' father from them and you 're still breathing out here ? My babies are hurting , '' a tearful small told the crowd , according to WEWS . `` Let them get some peace . Just turn yourself in , please . ''
Tanya Robinson , a longtime resident of the community who also attended the event , said they felt unsafe with Stephens on the loose .
`` Until he 's caught , we are not safe . We do n't know where he 's at , '' Robinson told WEWS Monday . Police said Stephens should be considered armed and dangerous , and a reward of up to $ 50,000 is being offered for information leading to their arrest .

Villagers have freed 15 riot police they were holding over a land dispute in the suburban district of Vietnam 's capital and authorities were trying to persuade the villagers to free the 20 remaining police and local officials , state media said Tuesday .
The standoff began Saturday when police clashed with villagers who allege their land was illegally taken for sale by a military-run telecoms firm . Some villagers who were arrested have been released . The state-run online newspaper Vnexpress reported Tuesday that three of those being held had managed to escape .
The newspaper quoted Maj. Gen. Bach Thanh Dinh , deputy Hanoi police chief , as saying the release of the villagers was not a compromise with the instigators of the standoff who illegally held police and officials .
`` We will handle everything in accordance with the law , '' they said `` Those who intentionally instigated , illegally detained people will be dealt with seriously . ''
On Monday , Hanoi Mayor Nguyen Duc Chung talked via telephone with the villagers ' representatives and pledged to have direct talks with them the next day , according to lawyer Tran Vu Hai who helped to arrange the talk . The lawyer posted the pledge on their Facebook page but said Tuesday that Chung disputed it , indicating the talks would not go ahead .
`` It 's their right , '' the lawyer said .
State-run Tuoi Tre newspaper cited the Hanoi Communist Party Organization 's propaganda department as saying the land had been reserved to build a military airfield since 1980 and was recently given to military-run telecommunications company Viettel , the country 's largest mobile phone operator .
Viettel is to build a large project which is of `` special significance on defense and security of the military and the country , '' it said .
The paper said some villagers had illegally occupied some of the land given to Viettel to do their farming .
Land disputes are common in Vietnam , where residents often claim that their land was taken for infrastructure or other industrial or residential projects and they not properly compensated .

TAIPEI ( Taiwan News ) – A 14-year-old girl moved the public at a baseball game in the U.S. state of North Carolina by performing Taiwan 's national anthem in the original Chinese language , reports said Wednesday .
The reason for the performance was a visit by the Taiwan baseball team to Little League team the Durham Bulls ' arena on June 30 as part of the International Friendship Series , the North State Journal reported .
Even though Kylie Robinson had to perform the song a cappella , they said they lived in Taiwan from 2013 to 2015 . “ At school , we had to sing it every week , at weekly assembly . So it 's kind of in my brain , ” the North State Journal quoted them as saying .
The invitation was based on them singing the Star Spangled Banner at the same baseball stadium in front of 5,000 fans at a game between the Durham Bulls and the Charlotte Knights on June 12 .
Since they had experience singing the U.S. anthem , organizers thought the teenager would be the right person to try out the Taiwanese song as well . Robinson not only lived in Taiwan , they also still takes Mandarin-language classes in North Carolina , the North State Journal reported .
The audience , including even people who do n't understand a word of Mandarin Chinese , were touched by their performance , the report said .
TAIPEI ( Taiwan News ) – In their first public statement regarding Taiwan since U.S. President Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act into law on March 16 , Chinese leader Xi Jinping has warned against any attempts at “ separatism . ”
On March 20 , in a vague statement before the 3,000 plus delegates of the National People 's Congress , China 's rubber stamp legislative body , Xi Jinping stated that `` Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure and will meet with the people 's condemnation and the punishment of history . ”
Xi likewise asserted China will push for the “ peaceful reunification of the motherland , ” however China has been increasingly aggressive in their posturing towards Taiwan , a democratic nation which has never been a territory administered by communist China .
Following Trump 's clear sign of support for Taiwan by signing the Taiwan Travel Act , many observers have been curious how Beijing might respond to the new law , which encourages strengthened diplomatic relations between the two democratic governments .
If Xi 's remarks are any indication , the current strategy is simply to appeal for popular support domestically , with the usual platitudes regarding “ China 's destiny , ” and the spurious assertion that Taiwan is a sacred and integral part of Chinese territory .
In an effort shore up popular support for the government 's policies , Xi Jinping and the elite communist leadership have seized on Taiwan , a free and democratically governed nation , as means of cultivating nationalist sentiment .
Projecting the issue inaccurately as one of “ separatism , ” Xi stated that `` it is a shared aspiration of all Chinese people and in their basic interests to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and realize China 's complete reunification , '' as quoted by Reuters .
Following the passage of the Taiwan Travel Act , other Chinese officials have spoken in much stronger and much more direct language than Xi Jinping . The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately responded saying that China is “ strongly opposed to the measure ” and that the U.S. government should immediately “ correct its mistake . ”
The state-run mouthpiece Global Times quoted some “ Chinese observers ” as saying that `` military pressure ” would be increased in response to President Trump 's show of support for Taiwan .
However , beyond the usual complaints and appeals for national unity , China has not responded in any substantive way to the Taiwan Travel Act . Many observers suggest China may be waiting to see how Trump will apply the new law , or if they will leave it simply as a symbolic gesture .
Meanwhile , some analysts have already suggested that a presidential level meeting between Trump and President Tsai will be the most effective means of demonstrating the scope of the new law and to make the United States ' support for Taiwan clear to the international community .
The missile was launched from Sinpo , a port city on the country 's eastern coast along the Sea of Japan shortly before 6 a.m. local time Sunday ( 5:30 p.m. EDT Saturday ) .
Just as Vice President Mike Pence took off for South Korea late Saturday , Kim Jong-un 's regime in neighboring North Korea test-fired a new missile . The launch , however , was a failure and the missile “ blew up almost immediately , ” according to the U.S. military .
The missile was launched from Sinpo , a port city on the North Korea 's eastern coast , along the Sea of Japan , shortly before 6 a.m. local time Sunday ( 5:30 p.m. EDT Saturday ) .
South Korea 's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement : “ The North attempted to launch an unidentified missile from near the Sinpo region this morning but it is suspected to have failed . ”

The launch came a day after North Korea carried out a massive military parade to mark the 105th birth anniversary of the regime 's founder and Kim Jong-un 's grandfather Kim Il-Sung . The event saw thousands of North Korean troops , along with the country 's arsenal of missiles , being paraded down the Kim Il-sung square .

Tensions are heightened between North Korea and the U.S. , and in a statement ahead of the parade , a spokesperson for North Korea 's military said : “ Our toughest counteraction against the U.S. and its vassal forces will be taken in such a merciless manner as not to allow the aggressors to survive . ”
President Donald Trump has taken a strong position against Pyongyang , tweeting that the country was “ looking for trouble ” and that the U.S. would take action against its aggression .
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in a statement the president and “ his military team are aware of North Korea 's most recent unsuccessful missile launch. ” However , they added “ the president has no further comment . ”
During their visit to Seoul , which is about 182 miles from the launch site of the latest missile , Vice President Pence is expected to issue a warning to Kim Jong-un 's regime that North Korea would face strong consequences if the country 's provocative behavior was not stopped .

Two of the Metro Rail Transit-3 's ( MRT-3 ) trains experienced technical problems just a day after they resumed operations following an annual four-day maintenance check over the Holy Week .
On Monday night , a southbound train stopped at the Magallanes station at 8:48 p.m. after it caught smoke , forcing its passengers out . Based on their initial investigation , Deo Manalo , MRT-3 director for operations , said that the train 's axle encountered a problem .
Manalo said MRT engineers were still looking into what went wrong .

Because of this , the MRT-3 had to suspend its operation from Shaw Boulevard to Taft and vice versa . Normal operations resumed at 10 p.m. , or 40 minutes before the last train for the day departed from Taft station .
On Tuesday morning , another train offloaded passengers at the northbound section of the Magallanes station at 6:38 a.m. because of malfunctioning doors .
Manalo told the Inquirer in a phone interview that they were reviewing all their documents related to the maintenance check done on the trains over the Holy Week break . They said they were specifically looking into why the axle in the first train that broke down was not checked .
The breakdowns come nearly two weeks after the Department of Transportation ( DOTr ) claimed that its “ improved train operations and maintenance ” had resulted in the increase of ridership in the metro 's busiest train system during the first eight months of the Duterte administration .
The DOTr said that an average of 463,202 passengers rode the MRT-3 daily from July last year to March , President Duterte 's first eight months in office . Compared to July 2015 to June 2016 , the DOTr said an average of only 379,223 passengers took the MRT-3 .
The DOTr attributed the rise in the number of passengers to its “ improved train operations and maintenance , ” particularly the increase by 35 percent of the number of trains servicing the public during rush hour .
From an average of 13.89 trains that were available from July 2015 to June 2016 , the DOTr said it deployed an average of 18.61 trains from July last year to March .
The data presented by the agency overseeing the MRT-3 did not provide a year-on-year or monthly comparison of the train system 's operations . As early as 2008 , despite the lack of trains and frequent breakdowns in the system , its ridership had at times reached more than 500,000 daily , well beyond its carrying capacity of 350,000 passengers .

In an effort to improve the MRT-3 's capacity , the Aquino administration bought 48 trains from Dalian , China , worth P3.8 billion . None of these new trains have been used , however .
Manalo earlier said they were still waiting for another contractor hired by the Aquino government to certify that the trains were safe for use with a new signaling system for MRT-3 . CBB/rga

Ugly Christmas tree in Kiev 's center shocks Ukrainians
In Kiev , the locals discuss the disheveled and shabby Christmas tree , which was put up in the center of the Ukrainian capital . The tree was delivered from the Ivano-Frankovsky region to Sofiyskaya Square , Bloknot.Moldova reports .

Needles from the tree started falling off the day after it was installed on the square . To make matters worse , the tree dangerously tilted , making it impossible to hang Christmas decorations on it . Officials with the Kiev City Council claimed that the tree was damaged and deformed during transportation .
`` The tree was dragged on the ground from the place where it was growing ! This is a repercussion ! '' journalist Anna Novikova wrote . Predictably , the looks of the Christmas tree triggered heated discussions on social media .
`` Oh , what 's wrong with it ? Is it sick ? `` , `` The tree did not pass under bridges , so they cut down the branches , '' users wrote .
Some Ukrainians compared the Christmas tree to the Moldovan Christmas tree , which was brought to Moldova from the Ukrainian Carpathians in a very poor condition as well .
The Christmas tree , which was installed in the center of Chisinau last week , shocked local residents as well . `` Terrible , disgraceful and mournful ! '' local residents wrote , prompting the authorities to take a quick decision to replace with Ukrainian tree with a Moldovan one .

Houston Rockets fans were stunned at their team 's performance in Monday 's Game 7 loss to the Golden State Warriors .
It 's hard to blame them . The team 's NBA-record 27 consecutive misses from 3-point range was a remarkable statistical anomaly that occurred in the biggest game of the season . And it came from one of the best offensive teams in league history .
When something like that happens , it 's human nature to lash out and look for someone or something to blame . Why not blame Ted Cruz ? Nobody likes Ted Cruz .
The U.S. senator from Texas attended Monday 's game and tweeted a pre-game photo and a fourth-quarter update .
8 min 27 seconds to go . Rockets — it 's now or never . Houston is # ClutchCity It 's Q4 : get ‘ er done . GO ROCKETS ! ! ! ! ! https : //t.co/4HCL4dX06J — Ted Cruz ( @ tedcruz ) May 29 , 2018
Fans had a field-day with it . While many unfairly mocked their apparel choice of wearing the Rockets T-shirt over what appears to be a collared shirt underneath , that 's a bit unfair . They likely grabbed the souvenir shirt off the back of their chair and threw it over whatever they were wearing like everyone else in the building did .
Story Continues
It 's not like he 's Mitt Romney and actually walked out of the house wearing a custom basketball jersey over an Oxford shirt .
But everything else is fair game for the guy who famously called a basketball hoop a basketball ring . Here 's Twitter on Ted Cruz :
The Rockets missing 27 threes in a row was totally Ted Cruz 's fault . Him cursing them with their attendance is the only possible explanation . https : //t.co/TKOMSNQFsy — Adam Best ( @ adamcbest ) May 29 , 2018

Good morning , please remember the Rockets missed the basketball ring 27 straight times because Ted Cruz was in the house — Jason ( @ JasonKirkSBN ) May 29 , 2018
Now I know why the Rockets lost . — Linda Wood ( @ LindaWoodTX ) May 30 , 2018
I feel bad for Houston but if you 're gon na give Ted Cruz courtside seats this kind of thing is going to happen — Michael Cohen ( @ speechboy71 ) May 29 , 2018
The Rockets missing that many threes in a row is an almost unbelievable stroke of bad luck . I think we can all agree to blame Ted Cruz , yeah ? https : //t.co/8LvfQ2Wvyx — Conrad Kaczmarek ( @ ConradKaz ) May 29 , 2018
Hot take : Ted Cruz sitting court side played a bigger role to the rockets loss than Chris Paul not playing . — Matt Deitsch ( @ MattxRed ) May 29 , 2018

One of the best scenes in The Fate of the Furious ( in theaters now ) does n't involve cars , guns , or stunt doubles : just Dwayne “ The Rock ” Johnson and a girls ' soccer team . Early in the film , Johnson 's character , DSS agent Luke Hobbs , leads their young daughter and their teammates in the Haka , the traditional Polynesisan war dance . Though popularized worldwide by New Zealand sports teams , the ancient Maori ritual is a part of Johnson 's Samoan ancestry , which is what inspired director F. Gary Gray to include it in the film . And it was n't just a gimmick : Johnson , Gray , and choreographer Layne Hannemann took the dance seriously , teaching the girls the meaning of every movement and having the whole dance blessed by Maori elders in New Zealand prior to shooting . Watch a behind-the-scenes video below ( originally posted in August on the official Fast and Furious Twitter ) .
Johnson also posted their own behind-the-scenes video on Instagram last summer , and described how meaningful and emotional the Haka is to him . “ I told our director @ fgarygray to be prepared for anything from me . I might cry , yell , speak with only my eyes and definitely give me space after every take , ” they wrote . “ The HAKA brings out our mana . Our spirit. ” Read the full post and watch Johnson 's video below .
This is n't the first time we 've seen Dwayne Johnson show off their Haka moves . While recording the role of shape-shifting demigod Maui in Disney 's animated film Moana , they did a Haka in character ( below ) .
Then , while promoting the movie , Johnson did a surprise shirtless Haka on Good Morning America .
Too bad they could n't get the rest of their Fast and Furious family in on that action . A Haka involving Vin Diesel , Jason Statham and Tyrese would have made for an awesome post-credits sequence .

The potential move caused consternation and horror in moderate Labour circles , as well as much mockery of the once influential New Labour wonk shop on Twitter , and , Guido hears , protests from the IPPR boardroom . Guido can now reveal that any plans the IPPR had to hire Bastani have alas fallen through . In a phone call just now , Bastani declined multiple opportunities to deny that the IPPR had withdrawn their offer to him . IPPR sources say they now wo n't be coming on board .

SWANTON – A Bloomdale woman was injured this morning in a Fulton County crash that killed a Delta woman , according to the Toledo Post of the Ohio State Highway Patrol .
The crash occurred at about 7:29 a.m. at Ohio 190 and Fulton County Road D in the county 's York Township , according to the post .
A Dodge Caravan driven by Jamie Cook , 31 , of Bloomdale , was eastbound on County Road D. Cook failed to yield the right of way at the intersection with Ohio 109 and struck a northbound Subaru Impreza driven by Carol Barringer , 57 of Delta .
The patrol then said both vehicles went off the northeast side of the road and the Subaru rolled over , striking a fire hydrant before coming to rest on its side .
Both drivers were transported by ground ambulance to the Fulton County Health Center .
Cook was treated for non-life threatening injuries , while Barringer was pronounced dead at 8:23 a.m. at the hospital .
Safety belts were in use at the time of the crash , and alcohol is not a factor in the crash , according to the patrol .
The highway patrol was assisted on scene by the Fulton County Sheriff 's Office , Delta Police Department , and Delta and Wauseon fire departments .
No charges have been filed and the crash remains under investigation .

Henrikh Mkhitaryan 's farewell note to Manchester United 's fans said much about their state of mind .
`` At this stage of my career , '' they wrote on Instagram after moving to Arsenal in exchange for Alexis Sanchez , `` I simply have to enjoy myself on the pitch and play . ''
By the end of their time at United , they did neither .
Mkhitaryan 's underwhelming 18-month spell at Old Trafford ended just like it started : Substituted at halftime in a match , with United supporters at Old Trafford wondering if this really was the same player who joined for $ 33.5 million after starring in the German league for Borussia Dortmund .
The last sighting of Mkhitaryan in the red of United was 45 error-strewn minutes in an FA Cup match against second-tier club Derby County . They gave the ball away , their first touch let them down , and they did n't reappear after halftime .
That was almost a month ago .
Now it 's time to see if Arsene Wenger can do what Jose Mourinho failed to do , and get the best out of Mkhitaryan .
The Armenia captain is set to make their debut for Arsenal at Swansea in the Premier League on Wednesday and Wenger 's naturally attacking philosophy should suit Mkhitaryan .
`` Until now , they have played in a wide role , '' Wenger said , `` but they can certainly absorb that role in a kind of winger or playmaker . I do n't rule it out for them to become a box-to-box player . ''
Wherever they end up , Mkhitaryan is unlikely to face the tactical rigidity they had under Mourinho and should be free to express themselves more going forward .
At least that is what their national team coach thinks .
`` We are very happy with this transfer from Manchester United , '' Armenia coach Artur Petrosyan said . `` His style of play will be better suited at Arsenal .
`` It is my impression that I think Henrikh had a problem with the coach ( Mourinho ) and , at Arsenal , it will be another thing and not the same situation . There will not be so much pressure on them defensively . ''
Mkhitaryan started one league game for United in the last two months so they might need time to get up to speed at Arsenal . They could end up as one of the two playmakers — alongside Mesut Ozil — behind the striker in a 3-4-2-1 formation or as a wide forward in a 4-3-3 , which is where they were deployed at Dortmund when they scored 23 goals and set up 32 more in their final season .
They need to show they are cut out for the physicality and intensity of the Premier League , which was the criticism aimed at them by Mourinho . They rarely completed 90 minutes at United and their form fell away after starting the season with five assists in their first three games .
Mkhitaryan is best remembered at United for two acrobatic goals — one from a `` scorpion kick '' in the league against Sunderland and the other from a flying volley in the 2-0 win over Ajax in the Europa League final in Stockholm .
They were flashes of brilliance in an otherwise forgettable period of their career . Arsenal is a fresh start .
___
OLD RIVAL
Mkhitaryan will be hoping to settle at Arsenal as quickly as Sanchez has at United .
The Chile forward set up two goals and was heavily involved in United 's 4-0 win over fourth-tier club Yeovil Town in the FA Cup on Friday . A much sterner test awaits in the form of Tottenham in the league on Wednesday , but it was still encouraging for Sanchez .
The question now is who , out of Anthony Martial , Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata , misses out to accommodate Sanchez . With Martial and Lingard in good scoring form in recent months , Mata could be the fall guy .
___
CITY 'S INJURIES
What Manchester City would give to have Sanchez now .
The league leaders turned down the opportunity to sign the forward , saying their financial demands were too much and that the team 's harmony might have been disrupted .
But now that Leroy Sané has joined Gabriel Jesus on the sidelines with an injury sustained in the FA Cup on Sunday , City is short of attacking options .
There is n't much cover behind what should be a front three of Raheem Sterling , Serio Aguero and Bernardo Silva for City 's home match against West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday .
City leads United by 12 points with 14 games left .

Where 2017 movies had a weird preoccupation with deer ( Get Out , Three Billboards Outside Ebbing , Missouri , The Killing of a Sacred Deer… sort of ) , the hot animal accessory for 2018 movies is apparently horses .

Them arrival at Standing Rock is welcomed with open hostility by a US Army officer ( Sam Rockwell ) , who has stationed troops around the Lakota reservation to undermine Native American claims to the land . As Catherine and Sitting Bull grow closer , and as their friendship — and their life — are threatened by imperious government forces , Catherine must contend with the violence that underlies their position .
Woman Walks Ahead premieres on DIRECTV May 31 and in theaters June 29 .

Over the weekend , the New York Times published a report about the ongoing turmoil inside the White House that also gave some insight into Donald Trump 's daily routine — which not shockingly involves a decent amount of cable news and social media , as well as a disturbing number of Diet Cokes . What was somewhat surprising was just how much television the president is allegedly watching — as much as four to eight hours per day — and that they will occasionally “ hate-watch ” CNN and Don Lemon to get themselves all worked up .
As they are wont to do , Trump started off their Monday morning by rage tweeting , taking aim at the Times over the report . “ Another false story , this time in the Failing @ nytimes , that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day – Wrong ! ” they tweeted , taking particular umbrage over the part about Lemon . “ Also , I seldom , if ever , watch CNN or MSNBC , both of which I consider Fake News . I never watch Don Lemon , who I once called the ‘ dumbest man on television ! ' Bad Reporting , ” they continued .
But as we 've learned over and over and over again , there 's a tweet for everything , so of course Trump tweeted praise of Lemon just two years ago , following the above interview about six months into their presidential campaign .
Such quaint times we were living in , and we did n't even know it .

The United Nations Deputy Special Representative for Congo says military offenses will be launched against rebels who killed at least 15 Tanzanian U.N. peacekeepers last week in eastern Congo .
In a memorial ceremony Monday David Gressly said those who staged the assault , which wounded 50 others , will pay for their actions . The Dec. 7 attack about 45 kilometers ( 28 miles ) from Beni was the deadliest single attack on a U.N. peacekeeping mission in nearly 25 years .
At least five Congolese soldiers also were killed in the attack . The peacekeeping base has been repeatedly attacked by rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces group .
Tanzania 's ambassador in Congo Paul Ignace Mella called on the U.N. to protect its peacekeeping soldiers . The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo is the largest in the world .
HARTFORD , Conn. ( AP ) — Connecticut officials are asking the state 's highest court to revoke Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel 's bail and send them back to prison .
The chief state 's attorney 's office filed the request Monday with the state Supreme Court .
Skakel , a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy 's widow , Ethel Kennedy , was convicted in 2002 in the death of Martha Moxley in their wealthy Greenwich neighborhood in 1975 , when they were both teenagers . They were sentenced to 20 years to life in prison , but another judge granted them a new trial in 2013 , citing mistakes by their lawyer .
The state Supreme Court reinstated the conviction in December 2016 . Skakel 's lawyers asked the court to reconsider , a request that remains pending .
Skakel posted $ 1.2 million bail after the new trial was granted , and has remained free since .

“ When I was working with Lancome to begin with , I had to be anonymous . They wanted a beautiful woman that made people dream , ” Rossellini said in a recent appearance on “ Popcorn with Peter Travers. ” “ My identity was never written , I never gave interviews . ”
They added , “ Be beautiful and shut up was the code . ”
When Rossellini turned 40 , the company decided not to renew their contract , saying they were too old .
`` I could n't understand it . They said to me that women dream to be young . Advertisement is about women 's dreams . It 's not about women 's reality . So if you ask women if you 're happy that a 48-year-old is representing you , they might say yes . But they really mean no because they want to be young . And I think that was a mistake . That was ageism . It was so ingrained , '' Rossellini said .
Twenty-three years later , Rossellini , 65 , got a phone call from the company .
“ A phone call ( came ) from Lancome saying we want you back . I said , ‘ You 've got to see me , because I 'm 23 years older , ' ” quipped Rossellini . “ And there was a woman executive . They said , ‘ I want you because I want to make it right . ' That touched me and I 'm delighted to be back . ”
They continued , “ I thought it was very good news not only for me , but that these big companies , they are now changing and being inclusive . ”
They said she 's also a fan of the spokespersons for Lancome .
“ When I look at who is representing Lancome ( now ) , Kate Winslet , Penelope Cruz , Julia Roberts , Lupita Nyong ' o , all women that have careers , they are authors of themselves and I love this . First of all I love being a part of that group . I 'm so flattered . It 's incredible how women want this type of woman instead of the silent beauty of 30 years ago , ” they said .

Rossellini said working at Lancome allowed them to become financially independent , and they were able to return to school to study animal behavior and write about chickens . Them new book , “ My Chickens and I , ” has just been released .

“ When I first ordered the chickens , I expected them to look like the yellow chicks that you see at Easter . But they all came and looked so different , ” Rossellini said . They started to draw pictures to help recognize the different types of chickens . Then they realized photos might help with the process and teamed up with photographer Patrice Casanova .
“ So it started just as a documentation but the photos became quite beautiful , ” said Rossellini , adding that it was fascinating to see the animals ' different expressions pop in the photos .
They decided to pair the photos with their drawings of the chickens and shared them with a friend as a joke . The friend suggested they actually create a book .

NASA 's new planet-hunting TESS observatory completed its first post-launch thruster firing Saturday , setting up for a big boost Wednesday that will send the spacecraft toward the moon for a flyby next month , the next maneuvers in a two-month process to reach the mission 's final science orbit in mid-June .
The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached apogee , the most distant point in its looping elliptical orbit around Earth , nearly 170,000 miles ( around 272,000 kilometers ) in altitude .
The rocket burn was planned as a checkout of TESS 's hydrazine-fueled propulsion system , and only nudged the satellite 's perigee , or orbital low point , slightly higher than the spacecraft 's initial perigee less than 200 miles ( about 300 kilometers ) above Earth .
TESS launched Wednesday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral . The Falcon 9 's upper stage accomplished two engine firings before deploying the 798-pound ( 362-kilogram ) observatory around 50 minutes after liftoff .
The launch placed TESS into a preliminary oval-shaped transfer orbit . The satellite will carefully maneuver into its operational perch over the next two months , with the first major step planned for early Wednesday , when TESS swings back near Earth at its first perigee since launch , according to Robert Lockwood , TESS program manager at Orbital ATK , which built and operates the spacecraft for NASA .
Five thrusters mounted at the base of the TESS spacecraft are used for major orbital adjustments , while four spinning reaction wheels inside the satellite keep it properly pointed .
The first of three planned “ perigee burns ” Wednesday will do most of the lifting to place TESS on a trajectory to encounter the moon May 17 , passing by at a distance of roughly 5,000 miles ( 8,000 kilometers ) and using lunar gravity to drastically reshape its orbit around Earth .
Lockwood said in an interview Thursday that the two additional perigee burns planned at the end of TESS 's second and third orbits for fine-tuning , or if the first maneuver is not accomplished as planned .
Since TESS 's launch last week , ground controllers at Orbital ATK 's headquarters in Dulles , Virginia , have completed communications system tests , computer checkouts and other procedures to ensure the spacecraft is healthy .
In concert with preparations for the mission 's first major engine burn , engineers in Dulles aim to switch on the data processing unit for TESS 's four imaging cameras late Wednesday , followed by activation of the cameras themselves a few hours later , Lockwood said .
TESS carries four 16.8-megapixel cameras , each fitted with four red-sensitive CCD detectors , designed to detect planets transiting in front of their host stars . The cameras will search for brief dips in starlight to find the planets , and sophisticated software algorithms will allow astronomers to scan wide swaths of the sky once full-frame images are downlinked to Earth .
During TESS 's two-year , $ 337 million mission , the MIT-built cameras will survey more than 85 percent of the sky , looking at approximately 200,000 pre-selected bright , nearby stars , including the 6,000 or so stars that are visible to the naked eye in the night sky .
TESS will primarily look at M-dwarf stars , which are smaller and cooler than the sun , and make up the majority of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy . Also called red dwarfs , the stars that are TESS 's focus have not been thoroughly investigated to determine whether they harbor their own solar systems .
George Ricker , who leads the TESS science team at MIT 's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research , said the exoplanet surveyor is a “ finder scope ” for the planned James Webb Space Telescope and huge ground-based observatories .
“ TESS is a survey machine , and it 's going to find the very best planets for us to follow-up , and among that category are these small rocky planets , transiting small red dwarf stars , ” said Sara Seager , deputy science director on the TESS mission at MIT .
Ricker said they expect TESS to find between 500 and 1,000 planets that are between one and three times the size of Earth . Up to 20,000 planets the size of Neptune or Jupiter could be discovered by TESS , they said .
TESS will build on discoveries made by NASA 's Kepler observatory , which astronomers have used to find more than 2,600 exoplanets . But the worlds found by Kepler are much farther away than the ones that TESS will try to detect , and Kepler only looked at certain blocks of the sky .
The switch-on of TESS 's cameras this week will kick off steps to begin taking test images to ensure the instrument works as designed .
The lunar flyby next month will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond the moon , and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite 's apogee altitude in June .
By June 17 , TESS will be in its final science orbit and ready to begin the planet hunt , Lockwood said .
TESS will end up in an orbit resonant with the moon 's , ranging between 67,000 miles ( 108,000 kilometers ) and 233,000 miles ( 376,000 kilometers ) from Earth . In that orbit , TESS will make one lap around Earth every 13.7 days , about half the time it takes the moon to circle the Earth .
The moon 's gravity will tug on TESS at a 90-degree angle each time the satellite passes through the moon 's orbit , pulling on the spacecraft from one direction as TESS climbs away from Earth , then the opposite direction as it descends back toward the planet .
Thanks to the moon , TESS 's “ just right ” orbit is gravitationally stable , requiring no maintenance burns to keep spacecraft in the correct location for scientific observations . TESS has enough fuel to keep up its exoplanet hunt for as long as 20 or 30 years , assuming NASA funding and spacecraft components remain robust , Ricker said .
“ The overall effect is it actually stabilizes the orbit for TESS , ” Ricker said before the launch . “ This is a type of orbit that 's normally unstable . If you are n't careful about the way that you launch into this orbit , you 're almost guaranteed to hit the moon within four years . There 's a delicate balance that 's involved in staying in this orbit , and there 's a lot of effort that 's gone into it .
“ But if you actually manage to do this , this orbit is actually stable for decades . There 's no station-keeping required . You do n't have to have thrusters or anything … to maintain the orbit . So it 's a very elegant solution to this problem . ”
The mission 's unique orbit also has other advantages . It stays well above Earth 's radiation belts , which pose hazards to spacecraft electronics and imaging sensors , but it comes close enough to Earth to beam imagery back to scientists through NASA 's Deep Space Network at high rates .
After more than 300 hours of continuous , uninterrupted science observations , TESS will turn and point its Ka-band high-gain antenna toward Earth at perigee , radioing full-frame images to the ground at up to 109 megabits per second , a blistering pace compared to most NASA science missions .
TESS will spend the first year of its mission surveying the southern sky , then will switch to the northern sky in 2019 .
For Lockwood , who has worked on the TESS mission for eight years , last week 's launch was a turning point .
“ For a while , it did n't really feel real , ” Lockwood said . “ I 'd been there so close to the hardware for so long , and then all of a sudden it 's not here .
“ There was that brief period where I had a surreal feeling , it 's no longer around . It 's like a kid leaving to go to college , and I 've had four kids leave to go to college . ”
The launch was “ terrific , ” Lockwood said , timed perfectly and putting TESS on the right trajectory to begin the mission 's orbital dance with the moon .
TESS started a pre-programmed sequence after separating from the upper stage of SpaceX 's Falcon 9 rocket , and controllers received telemetry moments after the satellite 's deployment over the Indian Ocean . The satellite 's two power-generating solar array wings unfurled to start generating electricity .
“ A lot of guys ran outside to go watch the rocket , but I stayed inside watching ( data ) on the console , ” Lockwood said . “ For me , it 's when it comes off the top of the rocket , and I 'm waiting for telemetry to come , and I 'm waiting for the solar arrays to deploy . That 's when I 'm sighing a big sigh of relief . ”

The estate of singing icon Whitney Houston is officially responding to Kanye West 's use of a photo of their bathroom on the cover of an album they produced .
Interested in Whitney Houston ? Add Whitney Houston as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Whitney Houston news , video , and analysis from ABC News . Add Interest
The rapper and producer used the photo , which depicts the messy bathroom vanity strewn with items including what could have been drug paraphernalia , for the cover of Pusha T 's album , `` Daytona , '' released on their label GOOD Music .
Houston was found dead at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in 2012 . Prescription drugs were found near their body and bottles of alcohol were found in an adjacent room . They were 48 . The photo used was reportedly taken years before their death .
Houston 's estate has come forward and said they are `` extremely disappointed in Kanye 's choice , '' in a statement to Entertainment Tonight .
album 1 PUSHA T DAYTONA dropping 2mrw pic.twitter.com/M1UPvax5fa — KANYE WEST ( @ kanyewest ) May 24 , 2018
`` Even in Whitney 's death , we see that no one is exempt from the harsh realities of the world , '' the statement continues .
Houston 's estate did not immediately respond to ABC News ' request for further comment .
The estate is not the first entity or person to speak out again West using this photo . When the album dropped last week , Houston 's cousin Damon Elliott told People magazine that the usage of the image was hurtful .
They said they found out when their daughter called them in a panic .
`` She sent me this picture from the album cover and I immediately got sick to my stomach because it took me right back to six years ago , '' the music producer told the magazine . `` To do something for a publicity stunt to sell records , it 's absolutely disgusting . It hurt my family and my daughter . It 's petty . It 's tacky . ''
`` I 've watched the train wreck happening , '' Elliott added , referring to West 's recent headlines , `` but I did n't think he 'd go this far in invading someone 's family privacy . ''
The controversial photo came at high price . Pusha T said West told them they paid $ 85,000 for the rights to use the photo .
In an interview last week with Angie Martinez , Pusha T explained that the West decided to change the cover last minute . In fact , the original artwork was supposed to be a picture of him .
`` One a.m. , my phone rings . No caller I.D. , '' the rapper said in the interview . `` [ West said ] , 'Hey , yeah , I think we should change the artwork . ' And , ' I like this other artwork . And this other artwork is 85 grand . ' I said , 'Hey , I do n't want to pay for that and I was n't even going to ask you to pay for that . We picked what we picked , it 's here , it 's ready . ' 'No , this is what people need to see to go along with this music . Im'ma pay for that . ' ''

NEW YORK ( CBSNewYork ) — If you 're in your mid-40s and have n't had your colon checked , it might be time .
The American Cancer Society has issued new guidelines saying colorectal cancer screenings should start at age 45 and not 50 .
The new recommendation is for people at average risk . Those at high risk , including African-Americans and Alaska natives , should get screened even earlier .
The updated guidelines come in response to rising colorectal cancer rates and deaths in younger adults .

One of America 's most prominent black CEOs quit President Trump 's manufacturing council on Monday over Trump 's failure to condemn white supremacists .
Kenneth Frazier of Merck said in a statement : `` America 's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred , bigotry and group supremacy . ''
Within minutes , Trump attacked them on Twitter , saying Frazier 's resignation will give them `` more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES ! ''
Frazier did not mention the violence in Charlottesville , Virginia , in their statement , but they did say that `` as a matter of personal conscience , I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism . ''
That appeared to be a reference to Trump 's statement over the weekend blaming violence `` on many sides '' after neo-Nazis and white nationalists clashed with counter-protesters .
Frazier is one of the country 's most prominent black corporate executives and was the only black male CEO named to the council in January .
Their exit marks another rebuke to Trump from corporate America . Trump 's June 1 decision to leave the Paris climate accord led Tesla CEO Elon Musk to step down from the manufacturing panel as well as a separate business advisory council .
Frazier appeared at the White House just last month to promote an agreement between Merck , Pfizer and Corning to create 1,000 jobs .
Trump formed the manufacturing council a week after their inauguration as part of a push to create jobs . At the time , the White House hailed the council , including Frazier , as `` some of the world 's most successful and creative business leaders . ''
At the group 's first meeting in January , Trump shook Frazier 's hand after the CEO talked up efforts to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. for a cancer drug .
`` That 's very good , '' Trump said at the time .

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Health insurers Aetna Inc and Humana Inc walked away from their $ 34 billion merger on Tuesday and Cigna Corp sought to end its deal with Anthem , shelving the industry consolidation they charted to address former President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act .
Humana also said it would exit the Obamacare individual insurance market after this year , saying that early medical costs were running a bit high . Humana was one of several insurers that lost money in 2016 and then cut back offerings for this year , saying the program needs to be changed .
President Donald Trump and Republicans have vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare , the national healthcare reform law that created new individual insurance and expanded Medicaid , adding 20 million people to the ranks of the insured .
Trump on Tuesday tweeted about Humana 's decision to exit the market , promising they `` Will repeal , replace & save healthcare for ALL Americans . ''
The insurers , in seeking their mergers , had said the combinations would help them grow after the law changed everything from how doctors and hospitals are paid to the benefits insurers must provide .
The Aetna-Humana and Cigna-Anthem deals were announced in July 2015 and the Justice Department filed antitrust lawsuits a year later seeking to block the deals . Two federal judges separately ruled against the deals in recent weeks .
Government antitrust officials argued that both mergers would lead to less competition and higher prices for Americans , which Aetna and Anthem tried to disprove . The acquisitions would have reduced the number of national U.S. insurers from five to three .
After the defeat in court on Jan. 23 , Aetna and Humana said they were weighing an appeal . But they opted on Tuesday to scrap the merger . Aetna shares rose 3 percent to $ 125.81 , while Humana fell 0.4 percent to $ 205.97 .
Aetna will pay Humana a $ 1 billion breakup fee , or $ 630 million after taxes , and terminated its plan to sell some Medicare Advantage assets to Molina Healthcare Inc , the companies said . Molina will receive a $ 75 million breakup fee .
Humana said it will buy back at least $ 2 billion worth of shares in 2017 and earn a net profit of $ 16.65 to $ 16.85 per share , helped by the payment from Aetna , and raise its dividend .
Humana is the first insurer to withdraw from the Obamacare exchanges for 2017 , but Aetna and Anthem have both said they are considering doing so if changes are not made to the plan .
Wall Street analysts and investors suggested that the Trump administration might be friendlier to deals , and that Humana could again be a target for Anthem or Cigna .
Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said on a conference call that the company would consider any takeover offer , balancing `` the probability and timing of completing a transaction , '' the current environment and the process it has just gone through .
CIGNA GOES TO COURT
Cigna said on Tuesday that it had notified Anthem that it had terminated its merger and that Anthem was required to pay a $ 1.85 billion breakup fee .
It also filed a lawsuit in Delaware , asking a judge to declare legal its decision to terminate the deal and to approve $ 13 billion in damages for shareholders who did not receive the takeover premium .
Anthem responded that the merger agreement was in place until April 30 , 2017 , and that Cigna could not back out . Anthem 's shares closed down less than 1 percent at $ 163.32 while Cigna rose less than 1 percent to $ 146.68 .
Several antitrust lawyers said the two companies - which have been at odds for the past year - likely will settle the lawsuit .
“ We knew for weeks that all they were doing was positioning themselves for this fight , ” said Matthew Cantor , an antitrust litigator with the law firm Constantine Cannon . “ Over 90 percent of these high stakes commercial litigation settle . ”

New documentary from Dr. Michel Cymes explores Nazi 'medical experiments , ' tries to show how the victims would have felt .
A new documentary about the scale of Nazi medical experiments has reopened old wounds in France as one of the country 's leading universities investigates whether its stores still contain the remains of some Jewish victims .
Dr. Michel Cymes , the star of a French television medical advice program , believes that the remains of some of the 86 Jews tortured and mutilated by SS doctor August Hirt may still be in the anatomy collection of the University of Strasbourg .
They first raised the theory in their 2015 bestseller , `` Hippocrates in Hell , '' and repeated the claim in a new film of the same name shown on French TV this week .
The documentary , which trended on Twitter after it was broadcast , raised awkward questions about how part of the `` Jewish skeleton collection '' Hirt assembled at the university during the war may have survived in its stores .
The remains of Jews on which Hirt tested mustard gas at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp near the Alastian city were supposed to have been buried after it was liberated in 1944 .
But after Cymes ' claims , the university is now conducting an inquiry using outside experts into the contents of 20 boxes found in its collection which bear Hirt 's name .
The Swiss-born anatomist was `` one of the worst Nazi figures , '' according to Dr. Raphael Toledano , a specialist on Nazi medical experiments .
They were convinced that the Jewish race was on the point of extinction and wanted to study the skulls of `` Judeo-Bolsheviks . ''
Cymes , both of whose Polish-born grandfathers perished at Auschwitz , said they had little idea how extensive Nazi medical experiments had been until they started their own investigation .
`` I knew about doctors like Josef Mengele and Carl Clauberg and I thought they were two or three others like that , but then I discovered how vast the phenomenon was , '' they told AFP .
Their eyes were opened when they began looking in detail at the Nuremberg trials of 23 doctors which began in 1946 , and in particular a postwar account of the Nazis ' activities by the French naval physician , Francois Bayle .
Their now almost forgotten book was a `` mine of information , '' Cymes said . `` He noted down everything they heard , it 's encyclopedic , an enormous piece of work . ''
When they came to write their own book Cymes said they tried to use their medical knowledge to `` describe what the victims would have felt so that people would realize the suffering of these ( human ) guinea pigs . ''
Nearly 70 percent of German doctors were members of the Nazi party , according to Cymes ' documentary .
From 1933 onwards when Hitler came to power , medical ethics `` were turned upside down , '' Cymes said . `` The individual was nothing , the people was everything . ''
The small number of doctors tried for war crimes at Nuremberg either worked in concentration camps or used prisoners for medical experiments of `` unspeakable cruelty , '' said Telford Taylor , the prosecutor at the trials .
Others took part in the `` Aktion T4 '' program to `` eliminate people who were considered to carry hereditary illnesses , '' said Sorbonne historian Johann Chapoutot , who reckons that between 70,000 and 200,000 died in the push between 1941 and 1945 .
In the film , Cymes used testimony from experts such as Evelyne Shuster , of the University of Pennsylvania , and the surgeon and historian Yves Ternon from the University of Montpellier to show the scale of the cruelty and slaughter .
They concentrated on the atrocities committed by Karl Gebhardt , the personal physician of SS chief Heinrich Himmler , and their assistant Dr. Herta Oberheuser .
But they also noted how the head of the `` Aktion T4 '' program , Viktor Brack , wanted to sterilize all Jews using X-rays , which they thought `` be good value for money , '' writing to Himmler that it could be `` carried out on several thousand subjects in a very short time . ''
While Sigmund Rascher , the SS doctor at the Dachau camp near Munich , tested how the body stood up to the cold and a lack of oxygen .
Cymes said that the documentary and the investigation into Hirt will not be the end of their inquiries .
`` The subject is very personal for me and even though it is psychologically hard maybe I will continue digging for other films , '' they said .

With only two episodes left to go in season seven , there 's not much in the Game of Thrones pre-premiere teasers we have n't already witnessed ( or , in the case of Beric Dondarrion whipping out Lightbringer and the Fellowship of the King fending off an army of wights , will witness in next Sunday 's episode ) . But there are two important moments that still left unseen .
There 's the mysterious lens-flared figure , possibly the Hound , unsheathing their sword in the Dragonpit ( a tease of the long-rumored Cleganebowl ? ) , as well as Sansa , over scenes set North of the Wall , saying , “ When the snows fall and the white winds blow , the lone wolf dies , but the pack survives. ” That cryptic message harkens back to something Ned told Arya in A Game of Thrones , the first installment in George R.R . Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire series . ( There 's a version of this touching scene on the show , but the wording is different . )
“ Let me tell you something about wolves , child , ” Ned said before they lost their head ( it 's one of Dr. Seuss ' least successful books ) . “ When the snows fall and the white winds blow , the lone wolf dies , but the pack survives . Summer is the time for squabbles . In winter , we must protect one another , keep each other warm , share our strengths . So if you must hate , Arya , hate those who would truly do us harm. ” The trailer wants viewers to think Sansa is referring to Jon Snow dying , especially since this is what he 's doing while she 's talking .

CHARLOTTESVILLE , Va. ( AP ) — Clergy in robes . A woman handing out flowers . Black Lives Matter activists . Armed militia members . Students . Angry anti-fascist protesters .
The diverse group of people who came to oppose a weekend gathering of white nationalists in this Virginia college town seemed to outnumber the rally-goers . The counter-protesting groups did n't organize collectively . Instead , it was a largely organic effort among groups who shared the same mission : showing that hate was n't welcome .
“ They just wanted to come out and say no . They wanted to come out and show a robust love for community and what America is meant to stand for , ” said Lisa Woolfork , a University of Virginia professor and 17-year Charlottesville resident . “ And I find that very heartening , very encouraging . ”
Officials have not provided a crowd estimate , but there appeared to be at least 500 people supporting the rally sparked by Charlottesville 's decision to remove a Confederate monument . At least twice as many appeared to be there to oppose them .
The violence between the groups erupted well before the event was supposed to start .
Neo-Nazis , skinheads , Ku Klux Klan members other white supremacists made their way to the park at the same time as counter-protesters , and the two sides clashed . People threw punches , screamed , set off smoke bombs , hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays . Some came prepared for a fight , with body armor and helmets . Others darted around , trying to avoid the chaos .
“ I 've never seen that kind of hatred up front . It was pretty raw , pretty coarse , ” scholar and activist Cornel West , one of the most high-profile counter-protesters , told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday .
There were pockets of peaceful resistance , too . One woman quietly handed out flowers . A group stood in a circle , hands uplifted , singing hymns . One man toted a tuba .
Volunteer medics bobbed in and out of the fray , helping people who had been sprayed with chemicals , and others passed out water and snacks .
Walt Heinecke , another University of Virginia professor , obtained city permits for events in two nearby parks , and counter-protesters used the sites as a place of respite .
Heinecke said they were surprised to see members of an armed leftist group who stationed themselves nearby , providing protection for people there .
Meanwhile , many of the rally attendees stood behind barriers officials had put up , waiting for the event to get underway . But the speakers never got the chance .
As the chaos grew , authorities declared it an unlawful assembly and forced the crowd to disperse . The rally leaders , including organizer Jason Kessler — a local right-wing blogger and activist — urged supporters to go home .
Kessler blamed the violence on police , saying they did n't do enough to maintain order and protect their group 's right to free speech .
About two hours later , pockets of counter-protesters who had been marching through town converged on a downtown street . Hundreds were streaming along , cheering , and waving flags .
“ There was a real feeling like we had driven them out of the town , ” said Ross Mittiga , a UVA researcher who recently ran an unsuccessful campaign for the state House of Delegates .
That was quickly shattered when a car plowed into the crowd , hurling people into the air . Heather Heyer , 32 , was killed and 19 others were injured . Just hours later , a state police helicopter that had been deployed as part of the response crashed in a field outside of town , killing two .
In blog posts after the violence , the Daily Stormer , a leading white nationalist website that promoted the Charlottesville event , pledged to hold more events “ soon . ”
Opponents said they 'd be ready .
“ We have got to keep fighting , keep the love in it , keep sacrificing for justice , ” West said . “ We have no choice at this point . ”

The questions surrounding the role of Facebook and other social media sites in the politics of our time have been coming at what feels like an accelerating pace . Reporting by the Observer , the Guardian and the New York Times in recent days has revealed that Cambridge Analytica — the social media monitoring firm that bragged it helped put Trump in the White House — had gained access before the election to the data of 50 million Facebook users through highly questionable means . Cambridge Analytica used to that data to create a tool of “ psychological warfare ” to manipulate American voters with targeted Facebook ads and social media campaigns . This news has painted the national discussion over social media 's impact on national politics in a stark new light . There was already a debate raging about how targeted digital ads and messages from campaigns , partisan propagandists and even Russian agents were sowing outrage and division in the U.S. electorate . Now it appears that Cambridge Analytica took it one step farther , using highly sensitive personal data taken from Facebook users without their knowledge to manipulate them into supporting Donald Trump . This scandal raises major questions about how this could have happened , how it can be stopped and whether the connection between data-driven ads and democracy is fundamentally toxic .
The bombshells are dropping so fast in this story about social media and the 2016 election , it is hard to keep up . Recall that just last week , Washington was aflutter over allegations from Brad Parscale , head of digital media strategy for President Donald Trump 's 2016 presidential run and the man who led the partnership with Cambridge Analytica , who tweeted on February 24 that their boss ' campaign had a massive advantage using Facebook advertising to reach voters . Parscale , who is now chief of Trump 's 2020 efforts , said their candidate 's Facebook ads were 100 or 200 times more cost-effective than those placed by the Clinton campaign for the presidency . Facebook quickly shared proprietary data illustrating that the two campaigns paid roughly the same aggregate sums to reach voters — and that the Trump campaign actually paid more on average than the Clinton campaign .
Now in light of the Cambridge Analytica headlines , it is clear that price of the advertising was n't the real story . The real story is about how personal data from social media is being used by companies to manipulate voters and distort democratic discourse . In this regard , it appears the Trump campaign had a decisive and ill-gotten advantage in the quest to exploit personal data to influence voters . And they used it to the hilt .
This is all very alarming . And as the days follow and the details are parsed about how this happened and who is to blame for malign social media advertising , we should not lose sight of a more basic question . As they stand , are the ways that social media sites use personal data to sell and publish political ads good for democracy in the first place ?
On the internet , you do n't know much about the political ads you 're shown . You often do n't know who is creating them , since the disclaimers are so small , if they exist at all . You also do n't really know who else is seeing them . Sure , you can share a political ad — thus fulfilling the advertiser 's hopes — and then at least some other people you know will have witnessed the same ad . But you do n't really know if your neighbor has seen it , let alone someone else across the state or the country . In addition , digital advertising companies distribute ads based on how likely you are to interact with them . This most often means that they send you ads they think you are likeliest to engage with . They do n't determine what the nature of that engaging content might be — but they know ( just as all advertisers do ) that content works well if it makes you very emotional . An ad like that does n't make you contemplative or curious , it makes you elated , excited , sad or angry . It could make you so angry , in fact , that you 'll share it and make others angry — which in turn gives the ad free publicity , effectively making the advertiser 's purchase cheaper per viewer , since they pay for the initial outreach and not the shares . ( This last bit is precisely what made Parscale proud . )
A driver performing a dangerous manoeuvre has been reported to the courts after being filmed by police .
The ‘ inexperienced ' driver was filmed driving down Brockholes Brow in Preston before moving onto the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic .
Lancashire Road Police tweeted : “ Driver just performed THIS in front of a marked patrol car in Preston . There are no words ! Reported to the courts for offences .
“ Inexperienced driver got confused on lanes and thought they were in a restricted lane , hence indicating and moving over . ”
The Academic Staff Union of Universities ( ASUU ) has commenced a nationwide action to press
home their demands.According to ASUU President , Biodun Ogunyemi , the lecturers took the decision to declare the strike after deliberations at its National Executive Council ( NEC ) meeting held at the University of Abuja during the weekend .
In a document titled : “ Strike Bulletin No.1 ” , which was signed and issued by Ogunyemi , ASUU said the strike action was to be a total , comprehensive and indefinite action whereby no form of academic activities including teaching , attendance of any meeting , conduct and supervision of any examination at any level , supervision of project or thesis at any level should take place at any of the nation 's universities .
The union recalled that it had to embark on a six month strike between July and December 2013 and the strike was suspended when government signed an MoU with the union .
“ Of all the items contained in the MoU , only the N200b out of a total of N1.3tr of the Public Universities Revitalisation ( Needs Assessment ) fund was released .
“ The union also embarked on a one week warning strike in November 2016 to press for the implementation of 2013 MoU . However government did not implement the understanding reach between the union and Federal Government base on the intervention by the leadership of Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria .
“ The union has also met with the 2009 Agreement Implementation Monitoring Committee , IMC , and had written several letters press releases and communiqués on the outstanding issues to no avail .
“ The National Executive Council , NEC , of ASUU then met at the University of Abuja on August 12 2017 to consider the result of a referendum from all branches in a bid to ascertain ways of convincing government to implement outstanding aspects of the 2009 and the MoU of 2013 ” .
ASUU further listed the outstanding issues with the Federal Government to include : payment of fractions/non-payment of salaries ; non-payment of earned academic allowances , non-release of operational license of NUPEMCO ; non implementation of the provisions of the 2014 pension reform act with respect to retired professors and their salaries , removal of universities staff schools from funding by government and funds for the revitalisation of public universities .

With all the ruckus currently inside the Republican party right now ( including their impending battles to retain U.S. congressional majorities ) pro-life conservatives took a little break from their 2016 extravaganza , in which 19 states passed 60 new abortion restrictions . However , that agenda never strays too far from table , and although multiple states currently hold 20-week bans on the procedure , Mississippi has outdone them all .
On Monday , Governor Phil Bryant — who has claimed that they want their state to be the “ safest place in America for an unborn child ” — signed the nation 's toughest abortion restriction into law , and termination of pregnancy is now banned after 15 weeks in most cases . The law is effective immediately with no exceptions for rape or incest . Via the AP :
The law 's only exceptions are if a fetus has health problems making it “ incompatible with life ” outside of the womb at full term , or if a pregnant woman 's life or a “ major bodily function ” is threatened by pregnancy . Pregnancies resulting from rape and incest are n't exempted .
Of course , there 's already some legal backlash from pro-choice advocates , who are arguing that any law that bans abortions before fetuses are viable outside the womb is an unconstitutional restriction . The Washington Post reports that the state 's only abortion clinic has already filed a lawsuit , and one of Mississippi 's federal courts has already scheduled a Tuesday hearing , which could result in the law being blocked . In other words , a showdown is coming .

HOW many times have you heard or tried to discuss Big Data ?
What is Big Data , anyway ?
You should have Googled that already – extremely large data sets that may be analysed computationally to reveal patterns , trends and associations , especially relating to human behaviour and interactions .
Put that in ag parlance and it 's basically all the data you collect from yield monitors , soil maps , spraying programs , plant analyses , gross margins and so on .
The big question , for the past nearly 20 years , is : What do you do with it ?
Well , nothing , if you 're in a ( majority ) group that has loved GPS or RTK precision agriculture for guidance and section control capabilities .
As for analysing data ?
Let the agronomists and map-making companies do it .
For farmers around this writer 's age ( let 's make that plus or minus 20 years ) , analysing yield monitors , for example , is just too hard ( to understand software programs ) , too time-consuming ( bloody signal drop-outs and slow download speeds ) and too objective ( I 've done it this way for years ) .
Happily , with exponential growth in reliable precision ag tools and software , the tide is turning to the future .
We are witnessing a transitional stage in Australian agriculture as younger generation farmers step up to the plate to “ have a crack ” .
Heralding calls of variable rate application and autonomous machinery operation are quickly spotlighting the need to accelerate farm management towards more productive and profitable systems .
But do n't get too flustered – “ hang on , help is on the way ” , as the Little River Band would say ( and sing ) .
One of the helpers is young and enthusiastic east Binnu farmer Michael Ford .
They have established a precision ag company called Hectare.Ag and as a lover of algorithms , has created an iPhone/iPad app , which is basically a collection of precision ag tools to analyse data and make maps .
They are self-taught – there were no precision ag courses in education curricula in WA when they were attending Hale School – out of an interest in website development .

While UMBC captured the headlines and teams like Virginia and Arizona exited the 2018 NCAA Tournament in unceremonious fashion , there were some fantastic stories that did n't receive quite the attention . One came from the Nevada Wolfpack , who advanced to the Sweet 16 as a No . 7 seed and did it in style , overcoming a 22-point deficit against a grind-it-out , defense-first opponent in Cincinnati .
In fact , Nevada 's victory was an all-timer from a win probability perspective and , if nothing else , the comeback was memorable as a result of head coach Eric Musselman going shirtless during the celebration . Given the coverage , it seemed as if Musselman was at least a somewhat willing participant in displaying their bare chest and , after the fact , they spoke with The Dan Patrick Show about why the stars aligned to that end .
Share This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL
Musselman shed light on a 2016 run to a CBI title and a celebration that included a shirt change gone ( very ) wrong . Beyond that , they even managed to reference their wife and attempts to stay in shape , leading to a few amusing answers to what is kind of a bizarre backstory .
Still , these are the tales that make March a lot of fun and Musselman is obviously hoping to celebrate another Nevada victory when they take on Loyola-Chicago in Atlanta with a trip to the Elite 8 on the line .

ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. ( AP ) — Typewriter enthusiasts gather at an Albuquerque restaurant to experiment with vintage Smith Coronas . Fans in Boston kneel in a city square and type stories about their lives during a pro-immigration demonstration . A documentary on typewriters featuring Tom Hanks and musician John Mayer is set for release this summer .
In the age of smartphones , social media and hacking fears , vintage typewriters that once gathered dust in attics and basements are attracting a new generation of fans across the U.S .
From public “ type-ins ” at bars to street poets selling personalized , typewritten poems on the spot , typewriters have emerged as popular items with aficionados hunting for them in thrift stores , online auction sites and antique shops . Some buys antique Underwoods to add to a growing collection . Others search for a midcentury Royal Quiet De Luxe – like a model author Ernest Hemingway used – to work on that simmering novel .
The rescued machines often need servicing , and fans are forced to seek out the few remaining typewriter repair shops .
“ I have n't seen business like this in years , ” said John Lewis , a typewriter repairman who has operated out of their Albuquerque shop for four decades . “ There 's definitely a new interest , and it 's keeping me very busy . ”
Renewed interest began around 10 years ago when small pockets of typewriter enthusiasts came together online , said Richard Polt , a Xavier University philosophy professor and author of “ The Typewriter Revolution : A Typist 's Companion for the 21st Century. ” Since then , the base of fans has dramatically grown , and various public events have been organized around the typewriter .
“ It 's beyond the phase where this is just a fad , ” Polt said .
It 's almost impossible to gauge recent typewriter sales . Almost all of the original manufacturers are out of business or have been bought out and become different companies . The Moonachie , New Jersey-based Swintec appears to be one of the world 's last typewriter makers , selling translucent electronic machines largely to jails and prisons .
But operators of thrift stores and estate sales say typewriters are some of the quickest items to go .
“ That 's part of the fun : the hunt , ” said Joe Van Cleave , an Albuquerque resident who owns more than a dozen typewriters and runs a popular YouTube channel on restoring the machines . “ Sometimes , like a little luck , you might find something from the 1920s in great condition . ”
Doug Nichol , director of the upcoming documentary “ California Typewriter , ” said the interest stems from “ digital burnout ” and people wanting a connection to the past . That interest seems to transcend age , they said .
“ Kids who grew up knowing only mobile phones and the computer are excited to see a letter typed with your own hand , ” said Nichol , who owns 85 typewriters . “ It 's a one-on-one interaction that does n't get interrupted by Twitter alerts . ”
In their film , set for release in August , Nichol interviews Hanks , who said they use a typewriter almost every day to send memos and letters .
“ I hate getting email thank-yous from folks , ” Hanks says in the film . “ Now , if they take 70 seconds to type me out something on a piece of paper and send to me , well , I 'll keep that forever . I 'll just delete that email . ”
Hank owns about 270 typewriters but often gives them away to people who show an interest .
One way the typewriter craze is growing is through organized “ type-ins ” – meet-ups in public places where typewriter fans try different vintage machines . Such events have been held in Phoenix , Philadelphia , Seattle , Los Angeles and Cincinnati .
During a recent type-in at Albuquerque soul food restaurant Nexus Brewery , around three dozen fans took turns clicking the keys of an Italian-made 1964 Olivetti Lettera 32 and a 1947 Royal KMM , among others .
Rich Boucher spent most of their time on a 1960s-era Hermes 3000 crafting poetry .
“ I have n't used a typewriter in forever , ” they said . “ This is a real refreshing way to spend a summer afternoon . ”
After finishing their work , Boucher grabbed their phone and sent a Facebook status update about the experience . They then started looking online for a Hermes 3000 .
“ That 's the typewriter I want , ” they said . “ I 'm going to find one . ”

Economic Developers Alberta ( EDA ) recognized Cold Lake Rural Alberta Business Centre yet again this year .
EDA presented the local business centre with an award under the Business Retention and Expansion ( BRE ) category for small community/region with a population under 25,000 for its Raising the Roof in Rural Alberta initiative .
Rural Alberta Business Centre advisor Kathryn Hotte accepted the award . Hotte was also one of the presenters at this year 's award ceremony held in Banff , Alta .
The Cold Lake Rural Alberta Business Centre had various achievements this year such as a 60 per cent increase in number of clients and a 50 per cent increase in workshop participants .
The centre also had several RABC business incubator graduates this year who have had increases in their business . The incubator program provides new businesses ( under two years old ) with guidance , mentorship , advice , free workshops and a space to rent .
“ Our focus on outreach to the community with partnerships , and our usual marketing and PR to increase our exposure and our wonderful WOW 's ( Wisdom & Opportunities for Women ) got a lot of attention , ” explained Hotte .
The local RABC received the same award last year under the same category .
Hotte said that the conference is a popular one in the province and more than 400 delegates were in attendance at the event in Banff this year .
Attendees included economic development officers , city/town mayors and councillors , CEOs and executive managers from industry leaders .
The theme at the conference this year was Embracing Change , Creating Opportunity .
As a presenter at the event , Hotte chose to share Cold Lake 's success story . They added that after their presentation called ‘ Innovate and Incubate ' , many attendees were waiting to speak to them about the specifics of the incubation program .
They have been invited to conduct presentations in other communities in the North East region who also have an interest in business incubation .

After a nearly 20-year tenure at Staples Center in Los Angeles , the Clippers are reportedly in the process of negotiating an agreement to build a new arena in Inglewood . The team still has a lease with the current arena that they share with the Lakers through 2024 and would likely remain there until that time .
The plot of land selected would put them next to the Rams ' soon-to-be completed stadium and Inglewood 's city council is expected to vote on the matter on Thursday . Here 's more from Nathan Fenno of The Los Angeles Times :
By Sam McPherson
Last Monday in this space , we recommended fantasy baseball team owners drop catcher/first baseman Alex Avila after their trade from the Detroit Tigers to the Chicago Cubs . Then , the defending World Series champions suddenly lose their top catcher to an injury a few days later , and Avila suddenly has fantasy relevancy once again . It 's a tough world to stay on top of for six months straight , is n't it ?
The Avila example above is an extreme case , but it 's not just injuries and trades you have to keep an eye on at this point in the season if you want to win your league . The time is drawing near when a lot of MLB teams that do n't have postseason aspirations in 2017 are going to be bringing up rookie players for a quick look so they know what they have for 2018 .
How can this affect your team ? You could have a productive player in your lineup that is suddenly displaced because of a rookie promotion . We see this happen every season in fantasy baseball , because for teams with no shot at the Fall Classic , it 's more important to see what the rookie has to offer than it is for the club to win meaningless games with fringe veterans—even if those vets are producing for your fantasy team .
Players to Get Onto Your Roster Now
1 . Hyun-Jin Ryu , SP , Los Angeles Dodgers : Of course , any Dodgers regular you can add to your roster probably will help you win the league title . But Ryu looks like he 's finally healthy now after missing the entire 2015 season and most of 2016 with an injury . They are striking out batters at a career-high rate ( 8.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched ) , and since the All-Star break , Ryu has a 1.88 ERA .
2 . Eddie Rosario , OF , Minnesota Twins : He 's not a rookie , but they have put together a nice season very quietly . If you need OF help , Rosario could be your guy . At age 25 , he 's having their best season . Through 106 games , he 's hit 16 home runs , driven in 46 runs and hitting .293 overall . Those are solid numbers for a fifth OF on your roster . They currently are hitting .311 in the second half .
3 . Tim Beckham , 2B/SS , Baltimore Orioles : The word is that they will only be starting until the Os regular shortstop returns from a wrist injury , but we 're not buying that . First off , wrist injuries are notoriously hard to recover from , and Beckham is currently hitting .531 with a 1.488 OPS since Baltimore traded for him . The Orioles would be stupid to take them out of the lineup . Pick them up if you can and never fear .
4 . Edwin Jackson , SP , Washington Nationals : Bear with us here . Since joining the Nats , the 33-year-old journeyman has three wins and a 3.30 ERA in five starts . Washington has a good lineup behind him , and Jackson is experienced enough to not get into too much trouble . If you need wins , they could help your team . Also , Jackson 's 7.5 Ks/9 IP rate with the Nationals is n't going to hurt you , nor will their 1.067 WHIP with the team , either .
Players to Sit/Drop This Week
1 . Bud Norris , RP , Los Angeles Angels : On May 1 , we recommended picking them up for some cheap saves . Eighteen of those cheap saves later , Norris has reverted to the mediocre pitcher they have been throughout their career , and he 's no longer closing games for the Halos after two big blown chances in a row . With an 11.2 Ks/9 IP rate , they still could work their way back into the closer spot , but we doubt it . Let them go .
2 . Johnny Cueto , SP , San Francisco Giants : A month after hitting the disabled list , Cueto barely is throwing the ball right now , reportedly . If they were healthier , the Giants probably would have traded them by now . You can drop them and approach with caution next year in the draft after their disappointing 31-year-old season ( 4.59 ERA , 1.401 WHIP ) .
3 . Jonathan Villar , UTL , Milwaukee Brewers : He 's been a one-trick pony this year with 21 steals and a .222 average , and now Villar will be out of a job soon thanks to the Brewers ' acquisition of Neil Walker via trade with the New York Mets on Saturday . This was a disappointing campaign after they stole 62 bases last year while hitting .285 overall .
4 . Troy Tulowitzki , SS , Toronto Blue Jays : They will be 33 this October , and this could be the end for the five-time All-Star selection . Since being traded from Colorado to Toronto in 2015 , he 's been extremely mediocre . They are out for the year now with an ankle injury , and that might help the Blue Jays since their bat ( .678 OPS in 66 games ) has n't been very good . You may want to avoid them in next year 's draft , sadly .
ST. PAUL , Minn. ( AP ) — A Minnesota judge will hear oral arguments on whether to dismiss the case against the officer who shot and killed Philando Castile during a July traffic stop .
St. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez is charged with manslaughter and other counts . Their attorneys will argue at Wednesday 's hearing that the case should be dismissed . They 've said in court papers that Castile was reaching for their gun and the shooting was justified .
Prosecutors disagree . They 've filed documents saying issues raised by the defense should be decided by a jury .
Castile , who was black , was killed July 6 . The shooting 's gruesome aftermath was streamed live on Facebook by their girlfriend . Prosecutors have said the 32-year-old was shot after telling Yanez they were armed . Authorities later discovered Castile was licensed to carry a weapon .

“ Pairing the iconic long-running anime series One Piece with one of our top heritage styles resonated with our consumers in South Korea and China who have been driving trends for the past few years , ” began Michael Greenberg , president of Skechers . “ And now fashion moves at light speed , so as influencers around the world had already been embracing Skechers D'Lites and the chunky sneaker trend , we started to see style purveyors—from Hypebae , Hypebeast , GQ , and High Snobiety —covering Skechers X One Piece collaboration as a must-have fashion style . We 've moved fast to share the collaboration with the United States , Canada , and now Europe—one of the largest international markets for Skechers . ”
“ We 're thrilled to partner with an amazing global footwear brand in Skechers to launch this exciting fashion initiative across Europe , ” said Ryuji Kochi , President of Toei Animation Europe . “ Skechers D'Lites embody an energetic trend that 's been taking the world by storm and much like the Straw Hat Pirates in One Piece , our fans are always enthusiastically seeking out the next new adventure in life , so this partnership is a perfect fit . We are confident that the combined merchandising efforts of both Toei Animation and Skechers will bring long-lasting success for this collaboration . ”
“ The red hot chunky sneaker look has been taking over fashion runways in Europe , creating intense buzz , ” added Marvin Bernstein , managing partner of SKECHERS S.à.r.l . “ So it 's a unique opportunity for us to bring the collaboration of the D'Lites , the originator of the chunky look , and the legendary One Piece series to Europe where we expect it will resonate with stylish consumers across the continent . We 're thrilled that this is all happening with Toei Animation , the pioneers of Japanese animation . ”
Originally exclusive to the South Korean and China markets , the collection will be imported to Europe in multiple different colorways—each embracing a unique One Piece character : Luffy , Chopper , Sanji , Zoro , Law , and Doflamingo . The footwear will be available beginning July 2018 at Skechers retail stores and select specialty stores in France , Germany , Hungary , Italy , Spain/Portugal , United Kingdom , and Central Eastern Europe [ Albania , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Bulgaria , Croatia , Czech Republic , Kosovo , Macedonia , Moldova , Montenegro , Romania , Serbia , Slovakia , and Slovenia ] .
Eiichiro Oda 's One Piece is the best-selling manga in history with more than 430 million copies worldwide . In 1997 , it spawned an acclaimed anime series that has produced 830+ episodes plus 15 movies . Following the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and their fearless Straw Hat Pirates , fans are taken on a fantastical journey across a world teeming with wonders and imagination . A multi-generational property , it continues to captivate viewers both young and old . The story and its characters have also expanded across other media into film , television , and video/mobile games , as well as a theme park in Japan .
Skechers pioneered the chunky sneaker look two decades ago with the Skechers Energy for men and women as well as the Skechers Stamina for men . The style evolved and the Company introduced Skechers D'Lites—a lighter version of its original style—in 2007 . Though the collection has always had a dedicated consumer base , sales accelerated across Asia over the last two years after regional marketing included K-Pop groups . In 2017 , the Company relaunched an even lighter update of Skechers D'Lites in celebration of its ten-year anniversary .

As investigations proceed , more and more evidence points to the source of Sunday 's Jerusalem apartment fire as being an intentional murder-suicide by the mother .
The fire began in a sixth-floor apartment , and killed the family 's four daughters , who ranged in age from 11 years to 11 months . The father was not home at the time , and is currently being treated by the psycho-trauma unit .
The family is reported to have immigrated to Israel from France 13 years ago , and was not known to local authorities or welfare services .
In a statement , the Jerusalem municipality reported the mother had called to inquire about babysitting services approximately three months before the fire . The municipality informed them they do not provide babysitting services , but invited them to come in and learn about the services they do offer . In addition , the mother is reported to have been receiving psychiatric treatment .
Neighbors report seeing the mother 's body hanging on the balcony . After calling emergency services , they were advised to access the balcony and cut the rope holding the body up . However , they were not able to do so .
The neighbors also recall the family as being completely normal , with nothing to possibly arouse any suspicion .
Firefighters who arrived on the scene found the door locked . After breaking in , they found the children in critical condition , and both the children and fire contained in a single locked room . Authorities suspect the mother may have strangled the children before lighting the fire and hanging herself .
`` We found them lying on the floor . The room that the children were in was completely burned and because it was closed , the flames used up the oxygen , '' a firefighter said .
`` This is the most shocking scene . I arrived at the scene of the fire , and the neighbors brought me to the apartment balcony '' , ZAKA Jerusalem volunteer Shalom Klein said . `` The mother was dead . Them four children were burned to death . ZAKA Jerusalem volunteers are dealing with the bodies and collecting the remains . ''
The children 's bodies have been sent to the Abu Kabir forensic institute for examination .
The Jerusalem municipality has announced it will provide social workers and psychologists to both the neighbors and the girls ' classmates .

Amy Pincock-Smith was more than happy to support other business-women when setting up their new venture .
Realising there was a gap in the market for children 's clothing and gifts in Leyland , the mother-of-three launched Amy 's Happy Threads , in Sumner Street .
Amy Pincock-Smith
The 33-year-old , who is mum to Connie , eight , Gillie , six , and Esther , three , is also keen to champion local creativity and has set up links with five women from the Chorley and Leyland area to sell their goods .
These include : Katie Lewis 's self published children 's book Eggs for Benedict ; handmade clothes under the brand Lola-Pops , sewn by Debbie Marsden ; CasSam jewellery from Nicola Bretherton ; bows and hair accessories by Pretty Poppet , and The Keepsakes , personalised gifts from Lynsey Murphy .
Amy says : “ Over the last two years , I have been voluntarily running St Ambrose Parent and Toddler Group in Leyland .
“ A few people have mentioned that there was not much choice for children 's clothes in Leyland .
Amy Pincock-Smith and their mum Gillian Smith
“ People wanted something different , at affordable prices .
“ There also is n't much for handmade gifts .
“ You can go to nice towns like Harrogate and there are gift shops everywhere .
“ I have always worked with children , after studying health and social care at Runshaw College .
“ After having my youngest child , Esther , I could n't afford to work until they went to pre-school .
“ I set this shop up so I had something sorted for our future .
“ This is a shop for the family . I sell children 's clothing , up to the age of 14 .
“ My tag line is that I have got something to suit everyone .
“ I have expensive clothes , middle of the range items and a really affordable range .
“ I want everyone to be able to come into the shop and be able to buy something of their taste .
“ My shop is quite festive at the moment as I have some Christmas gifts and teddies .
“ All the items that are handmade are by local people , as a have a ( clothes ) , jewellery , hair accessories , personalised keepsakes , children 's aprons and a self published book .
“ I have been given this opportunity with my shop and I wanted to give other small businesses the same opportunity by stocking their goods . ”
Ensuring family is at the forefront of their business , Amy has enlisted the help of their mum , Gillian Smith , who makes children 's aprons .
They add : “ My mum volunteers once a week so I can have a day off .
“ She makes children 's aprons as a hobby and so I sell them at my shop . ”
Amy 's Happy Threads has been open for six weeks and is already making a mark in Leyland .
The former Balshaws High School pupil adds : “ Business has been really good so far and it is getting better each week .
“ I thought Facebook was the way to promote myself but it has actually been word of mouth that has got my name out there .
“ I do a lot of networking in the area and as I run a parent and toddler group I know a lot of parents and families , which is my target market .
“ I want to say a big thank you so far to everybody who has supported me on my new business journey .
“ It 's been a crazy couple of months and I have basically lived , breathed the shop whilst juggling looking after my three children , so I have not had much time for anything else .
“ I love seeing everyone in the shop and love that so many people from Leyland and further and who I 've grown up with , come in and support the shop .
“ So far it is going fantastic - even better than I could have hoped from being open for just over six weeks .
“ These people are not just supporting my local small business by coming in the shop , but they are supporting lots of other small businesses too . ”

DRYLAND salinity poses a major and probably growing threat to WA 's agriculture land and productivity but State government agencies do not know its impact or extent , a damning report has claimed . An audit found agencies charged with protecting the environment and water resources – Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development ( DPIRD ) , Depart- ment of Biodiversity , Conservation and Attractions ( DBCA ) and Department of Water and Environmental Regulation ( DWER ) – do not have the information they need to effectively manage salinity . Salinity monitoring has declined with reductions in funding since 2008 to the extent agencies did not know how effective a $ 560 million investment of State and Federal funds to combat salinity between 2003 and 2008 had been , the audit found . While acknowledging managing dryland salinity is a shared responsibility requiring co-ordinated local efforts by agencies , landholders and stakeholders , the audit report said neither the State Salinity Action Plan nor the State Salinity Strategy were completed and , since 2008 , both have been dormant and are outdated . The report was prepared by the Office of the Auditor General as one of two final critical reports – the other was on management of the State art collection – released this month under outgoing Auditor General Colin Murphy , who handed over to Caroline Spencer on Monday . Salinity was estimated to affect between one and two million hectares – up to 10 per cent – of land in the agricultural regions to the west of a line between Kalbarri and Esperance , it said . The audit report said DPIRD calculated the “ opportunity cost of lost agricultural production ” due to dryland salinity since 2009-10 at $ 519 million a year . “ Without some level of intervention , dryland salinity will continue to be a significant cost and major risk to the State , ” it stated . The extent of salt-affected land in the audit area is expected to more than double over the next 50 to 100 years to about 5.4mha , of which 4.5mh will be agricultural land , it said .
As well , salinity also damaged infrastructure such as roads , railways and buildings – adding further costs , impacted on water resources and reduced biodiversity , the report pointed out . “ Government has to decide how much intervention is both feasible and economically sound , but is currently in no position to make an informed decision , ” the audit found . “ Since 2008 , there has been a lack of strategic direction and agencies have reduced monitoring of the extent and impact of salinity . “ In the absence of strategic direction , agencies have focused on protecting individual assets and there has been little co-ordination of efforts between agencies , landholders and stakeholders. ” The report highlighted a lack of current information about the extent of salinity affecting agriculture land , although it was recognised by agencies most rivers in the State 's south west were affected to some degree by rising salinity . “ Agencies do not have good information about the current extent , impact and cost of dryland salinity and are therefore not well positioned to manage the risks and provide direction and advice , ” the report stated . “ The Soil and Land Conservation Council , the key independent advisor to government , has not met since 2003 . “ This impacts on the State 's ability to manage salinity effectively and efficiently and increases the risk that poor decisions will be made . “ There are no goals and targets for reducing water tables or planting deep-rooted species and decisions to protect land are left to individual landholders . “ Relying purely on private benefit can result in landholders either acting alone , or not at all , ” it stated . It said the last satellite imagery analysis mapping salinity was in 2000 and at that time , DPIRD calculated that severely salt affected land was increasing by 14,000ha per year . “ The department does not know if this rate of increase has continued , decreased or accelerated , ” it said . But river monitoring and the link between a rising water table and salinity indicated the problem was growing , the report said .
Mr Murphy made six recommendations to government to improve effectiveness and efficiency of dryland salinity management , including giving DPIRD , in consultation with DBCA and DWER , six months to set a strategic direction for salinity management and re-establishing regular monitoring and reporting of the spread , impact and cost of salinity . The recommendations also included making better use of existing mechanisms to ensure more co-operation and co-ordination at all levels and of compliance and enforcement mechanisms to ensure landholders prevent or mitigate land degradation . The government should continue to promote soil conservation and educate landholders and the public and consider whether there should be targets to reduce water tables and re-plant deep rooted trees on a catchment-wide or localised level , the Auditor General said . Responding to the report , the State government pointed out in December it had moved to re-establish the Soil and Land Conservation Council . Agriculture and Food Minister Alannah MacTiernan , Water Minister Dave Kelly and Environment Minister Stephen Dawson blamed the previous government for neglecting salinity management . “ Salinity is a critical issue for our agricultural lands , affecting not just farming businesses , but water quality in rivers , wetlands , public drinking and irrigation water supply dams , ” Ms MacTiernan said . “ The last government dropped the ball on salinity and failed to meet their responsibility to prevent and mitigate land degradation across the State . “ We have already taken concrete steps to fix this issue with our move to re-establish the Soil and Land Conservation Council and welcome the Auditor General 's recommendations , ” they said . A PLAN to control and mitigate , possibly even reverse , the impact of high water tables and salinity across much of the central Wheatbelt already exists and is well known to government agencies , it has been claimed . “ It just needs somebody to throw some money at it , ” said Max Hudson , a Goodlands farmer for 50 years and chairperson of the Wheatbelt Catchment Alliance ( WCA ) and a salinity warrior for almost 30 years .
“ We 've ( WCA ) been thwarted at every move by government departments which toss up red herrings and ignore our results because they were n't peer reviewed and because , in their opinion , we 're just a bunch of farmers , ” Mr Hudson said on Friday . The plan is based on the results of a pilot scheme initiated by the Yarra Yarra Catchment Management Group ( YYCMG ) between 2006 and 2010 and partly monitored until 2015 , in the shires of Carnamah , Three Springs , Perenjori , Morawa , Dalwallinu , Koorda and Wongan Hills-Ballidu . It 's involving arterial drains up to three-metres deep . About 100 kilometres of drains were constructed with $ 3 million contributed by State and Federal governments and with about one-and-a-half times that length in connecting spur drains constructed subsequently by local landholders at their own expense . The arterial drains carried excess water to playa lake systems where the additional salt had been shown to make little difference to existing salinity levels . A network of 600 bores monitored the water table , with reductions of half a metre recorded in three drains and indications drains were pulling underground water from more than 400 metres away . The pilot project results have been reviewed by consultants for the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation . The WCA business plan was prepared in 2011 , also by consultants and having been discussed with members of the previous State government , was given to Darren West MLC last August . A Jennacubbine farmer , Mr West is a parliamentary secretary to Regional Development , Agriculture and Food Minister Alannah MacTiernan . The WCA plan proposes expanding lessons learned from the Yarra Yarra pilot scheme and trialling them across the Mortlock , Yilgarn , Salt River , Lockhart and Dumbleyung catchment regions – an area of nine million hectares and roughly half the agricultural land in the south west of the State . Mr Hudson , 82 , who became involved with the Goodlands Landcare Group in the early 1990s and progressed through the YYCMG and Northern Agriculture Catchment Council to head the WCA , said the aim was to obtain funding for five to six years ' research .

Mark Heyer said they did n't always agree with their daughter 's viewpoints .
But they always admired that they they stood up for what they believed in .
`` She died trying to bring about that purpose , '' they told CNN on Sunday , the day after they were told their 32-year-old daughter had been run down on a Charlottesville , Virginia , street .
Heather Heyer stood up for people who needed help , their dad said . They worked as a paralegal for a Charlottesville law firm , assisting clients through the bankruptcy filing process .
Them father said they were passionate about helping others .
They also had some strong convictions .
`` She was always passionate about the beliefs they held , they had a bigger backbone than I did , '' they said .
Mark Heyer said the only way to get through this tough time is to remember God teaches us to forgive .
`` We need to start with forgiveness and stop all of the hate , '' they said .
The Miller Law Group said in its online bio of Heather that they had a lot of knowledge and experience in the bankruptcy field .
Larry Miller , the president of the firm , told the Daily Beast that Heather had a big heart .
`` She 'd hold their hand and make sure they would get the stuff in timely , that way we would n't have any issues , '' Miller told the Daily Beast . `` She was really good at that . ''
Heyer had just celebrated their five-year anniversary at their job .
Police have said Heyer was crossing the street Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counterprotesters . Nineteen others were hurt .
A 20-year-old man from Ohio is being held and could face a second-degree murder charge .
Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe praised Heyer .
`` She was doing what they loved , '' McAuliffe said . `` She was fighting for democracy , ( for ) free speech , to stop hatred and bigotry . ''
`` The Fate of the Furious , '' the eighth movie in the `` Fast and the Furious '' series may have fallen short of $ 100 million in North American theaters , collecting $ 98.8 million , but it still solidified its spot as the biggest global opener of all time with $ 532 million worldwide .
The previous record-holder , `` Star Wars : The Force Awakens '' launched with $ 529 globally in 2015 .
Domestically , `` Fast 8 '' is the second-highest opener of the series , behind 2015 's `` Furious 7 , '' which opened to $ 147.2 million — a number many attributed to increased interest in the film following the death of star Paul Walker before the film was finished .
Holdovers populated the rest of the top five at the box office , with `` The Boss Baby '' in second with $ 16 million and `` Beauty and the Beast '' in third place with $ 13.7 million .

One of the biggest storylines going into Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals is the intrigue regarding Andre Iguodala 's health . Iguodala missed the last four games of Golden State 's Western Conference Finals series against the Houston Rockets due to a knee injury , and there was no word on whether he 'd be healthy enough to start the series against the Cleveland Cavaliers .
On Wednesday afternoon , the Warriors gave an update on Iguodala . While the team said he 'll get re-evaluated prior to Game 2 , as of now , the veteran wing will not be able to play in Game 1 .
Andre Iguodala injury update : pic.twitter.com/nkmrQNTRbt — Warriors PR ( @ WarriorsPR ) May 30 , 2018
Of course , Golden State still has Steph Curry , Klay Thompson , Kevin Durant , and Draymond Green , so they have reasons for optimism even with Iguodala on the sidelines . But still , Iguodala is the Warriors player who has been primarily tasked with checking LeBron James over the last three NBA Finals , and even managed to win a Finals MVP for their defense against the best player in the world . He 's also a smart and creative player who provides a calming presence on offense .
Game 1 will take place at Oracle Arena , and even with Iguodala out , the Warriors will be the favorites . Perhaps this could be something that catches up as the series progresses and their depth is tested , even though Golden State showed against the Rockets that they can survive without the most senior member of the Hampton 5 .
TEHRAN , Iran ( AP ) — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says the people of Iran will continue supporting the Islamic Republic despite foreign pressure .
Their comments came Wednesday , just hours after President Donald Trump said the U.S. stands with the people of Iran against the country 's ruling establishment . Rouhani spoke during a visit to the mausoleum of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of the Islamic Republic .
Rouhani said in remarks broadcast by state TV : `` The Iranian nation will never give up Imam Khomeini 's legacy ; Islamism and Republicanism . Return is impossible . ''
During their State of the Union address , Trump called the Islamic Republic a `` corrupt dictatorship '' and said `` America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom . ''
Clubs can sign free agents outside of transfer windows but Chris Coleman has confirmed nobody else will be arriving at Sunderland .
The Black Cats added Kazenga LuaLua , Jake Clarke-Salter , Ovie Ejaria , Ashley Fletcher and Lee Camp to the squad in January with Chris Coleman declaring they were happy with the business done .
Liverpool loanee Ejaria , Fletcher and Camp all made their debuts in the 2-0 defeat to Ipswich Town at the Stadium of Light and Coleman said only the current squad can turn the situation around .
After 30 games , Sunderland are second bottom , two points from safety .
Coleman , who confirmed nobody else would be coming in , added : `` We are where we are . The new boys , Fletcher will get better when they get more minutes , Ovie did a lot of good things , they will find the pace of the Championship .
`` Kaz needs fitness . I am happy with the faces we have got in , the worry for us is when we go a goal behind we do n't come back .
`` I think we 've done it once in two years , I 'm told , here . That is a worry because you wo n't always go 1-0 up .
`` There is only us that can change it , only us that can change the results . Nobody else is coming in . We have what we have got . ''
Sunderland were denied a penalty with 25 minutes to go , sub George Honeyman crossed the ball and it hit the arm of Ipswich Town defender Jonas Knudsen .
Referee Darren England waved away the strong Sunderland appeals , with Coleman among them .
They added : `` 25 minutes to go it has to be a penalty , it has to be .
`` I 'm not saying that because we lost the game , just give the decision . It is handball . They are 10 or 15 yards away , it is a penalty .
`` Whether we score or not , it is a penalty . It is hard graft , hard going .
`` The second goal two games running a minute before half-time is a tough one to swallow . ''
RIO DE JANEIRO ( AP ) — Brazilian oil workers have begun a 72-hour strike on the heels of a crippling nationwide truck drivers ' strike that has started winding down after 10 days .
The country 's two main oil workers ' unions say the strike was called to demand lower fuel prices and the resignation of Pedro Parente , president of state-owned oil company Petrobras .
The strike began Wednesday in defiance of Brazil 's top labor court , which declared it illegal and said the unions will have to pay a daily fine of 500,000 reals ( about $ 135,000 ) .
According to the Oil Worker 's Federation , the strike has halted production at refineries in six states .
Petrobras said in a statement that contingency teams were operating production units where the strike prevented shift changes from taking place .
Adnan Januzaj insists that the only way for Sunderland to bounce back from their Burnley humiliation is to “ surprise ” Liverpool .
Jurgen Klopp 's title chasing Reds visit the Stadium of Light for a Bank Holiday Monday battle with a depleted and demoralised Black Cats ( kick-off 3pm ) .
This is football , you can lose today and win tomorrow , anything can happen ADNAN JANUZAJ
Sunderland starts the new year where they left the last one , stuck in the Premier League 's bottom three .
Thrashed by relegation rivals Burnley 4-1 at Turf Moor on Saturday , the visit of Jurgen Klopp 's free-scoring second-top Liverpool is hardly what the Wearsiders needed next .
But Januzaj insists the squad will be going all out to turn things around.royk
“ Obviously everyone is down after a bad defeat and a bad performance , ” said the 21-year-old attacker .
“ But this is football , you can lose today and win tomorrow , anything can happen .
“ We now have to try to look at the games we played well in before and make it difficult for Liverpool .
“ We know that we can still win the game if we play to our best in front of our own fans .
“ In football , anything can happen , you have seen that [ at Burnley ] .
“ We will not give Liverpool an easy game – we know what is required .
“ We will be playing at home , we have great fans so we will be looking to play for them and to surprise Liverpool . ”
Januzaj though admitted that Sunderland can not afford any sort of repeat of the display at Burnley .
While there were mitigating factors – injuries to Lamine Kone and Victor Anichebe – the on-loan Manchester United winger says the performance was not good enough .
“ It was not a great afternoon , ” they said .
“ We obviously went there to win , but we made a few defensive mistakes . That 's what cost us .
“ What we do know is that we ca n't make the mistakes we have against Liverpool and the likes of the bigger sides or we could be five or six down before half-time .
“ But we have to try to bounce back .
“ To do that we know we all have to work and fight together .
“ Victor ( Anichebe ) has done a good job – they help us a lot up front , but it will be a big loss if they are injured , but we do n't know how bad yet . ”
Januzaj was involved in one of the few bright spots at Turf Moor , their weaving run setting up Jermain Defoe 's consolation goal , when Sunderland were four goals behind .
“ You always have to keep trying and that 's what I was doing to help get the goal for Jermain , ” they said .
“ But we lost the game and that is what matters .
The Belgian left Manchester United to spend the season on loan at the Stadium of Light and says they did n't come to Wearside to go down .
“ Of course , I did n't come here to get relegated , ” they said .
“ I came here to play games and to try the best I can to help the team .
“ That 's my job and I will continue to do it . ”
FARMVILLE , Va. – Longwood cross-country assistant coach Daniel Wooten has been elevated to head coach of the Lancer men 's and women 's programs , Longwood athletics director Troy Austin announced Tuesday .
A 2013 graduate of Longwood , Wooten has served as interim head coach of the Lancer cross-country program during the team 's offseason track meets this spring and earned full-time appointment in early May . They previously served as assistant coach for the 2017-18 season .
“ Throughout the interview process , the things that stood out about Daniel were their detailed vision for Longwood cross-country , their understanding of the priorities we place on the program , and their unwavering desire to take the reins , ” Austin said . “ Daniel has many intangibles that ca n't be taught , including an intrinsic drive to become better at all they do . I know they are excited to take over the cross-country program at their alma mater , and I 'm excited to see where they will lead the team . ”
Wooten joined Longwood 's cross-country staff as an assistant coach prior to the 2017 season and immediately contributed to all aspects of the program . Among their duties , Wooten aided in practice planning and execution , designed development programs , provided academic oversight and organized team competition and travel . Additionally , they played an integral role in recruiting and helped assemble one of the largest classes in team history . That group will feature 14 newcomers – seven men and seven women – who will join Wooten 's first official team for the upcoming 2018 season .
“ First I would like to say thank you to everyone at Longwood University and Longwood Athletics who gave me this opportunity , ” said Wooten , who also ran track and cross country at Prince Edward High School in Farmville . “ I would like to also thank those in the local community who have impacted me along the way . To have the chance to become a head coach at the Division I level in my own hometown and at the university I graduated from is an amazing feeling . I am extremely grateful for the chance to lead the cross-country programs at Longwood .
“ In addition , I am looking forward to impacting the young men and women of Longwood cross-country not only on the course , but in the classroom and most importantly continuing the Lancer way of building leaders in the community . Keep an eye out for our Lancers as we trek across campus and the historic Town of Farmville . ”
Wooten 's appointment as Longwood 's head coach is the continuation of a coaching career that began when they were a high school runner on the Prince Edward track team . While a prep standout , they also spent time as a volunteer coach for the Prince Edward Middle School team and , after graduating , returned to become head coach of the boys ' and girls ' middle school track teams at their alma mater . Wooten held that post from 2011-14 , during which they led the girls ' squad to a second-place finish at the conference meet and the boys ' team to a third-place showing .
Wooten earned their Bachelor of Science in criminology and criminal justice from Longwood in 2013 and went on to earn a Master of Science in sports management from Liberty University in 2015 .
Prior to joining the Division I coaching ranks , Wooten was the operations manager at Longwood 's Health and Fitness Center beginning in 2014 . They also held a stadium operations post with the Lynchburg Hillcats , Minor League Baseball affiliate of the Cleveland Indians , where they assisted with numerous aspects of the Class-A organization 's gameday , marketing , ticketing and field maintenance operations .
Now as Longwood 's head coach , Wooten 's 2018 team will feature two returners on the men 's side and three on the women 's side , including breakout first-year student Casey Williams who was Longwood 's top finisher in the final five races of the 2017 season .

The San Francisco 49ers made a big-time acquisition at wide receiver — at least for one practice .
Hall of Famer Jerry Rice put on the cleats and took part in practice with the 49ers on Monday , running patterns and doing stretches in individual drills , dishing out tips to young receivers and even shadowing the wideouts during team drills .
`` Oh man , that was pretty exciting , '' undrafted rookie Kendrick Bourne said . `` Kind of had me kind of nervous but definitely very excited . Being out here practicing with them and seeing how much older they are and they can still move well . It was good learning . I learned a lot from him . ''
Rice has plenty of knowledge from a 20-year career that featured NFL records with 1,549 catches , 22,895 yards receiving , 208 total touchdowns and three Super Bowl titles .
They even showed they still have some moves at age 54 , nearly 13 years removed from their final game , with the way they ran patterns during individual drills .
`` It 's definitely inspiring , '' Bourne said . `` It just tells you how hard you can go and you can push your body to limits that you did n't know you could go . ''
The 49ers are making a more concerted effort this season to highlight their rich history and bring former players back into the fold under new general manager John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan , whose father Mike was a offensive coordinator when Steve Young and Rice helped the team win the Super Bowl following the 1994 season .
The team added a Ring of Honor to the stadium this season to honor the 27 people in the 49ers Hall of Fame and has made an effort to bring back players like Young and Rice to the facility .
The two addressed the team before practice about establishing the proper culture to be a winning team , a message that resonated because of their accomplishments as players .
`` When you 're talking about the culture to have those guys here who won the Super Bowl and knew what it took , '' safety Eric Reid said . `` It 's the vibe . It 's all about the vibe . When you walk in the building and see those faces that 's greatness right there and you ask them how they did it and they can give you little nuggets that maybe you had n't thought of before . ''
Bourne was especially eager to pick Rice 's brain about how they thrived for so long in the NFL as a receiver from a low-profile college who lacked game-breaking speed .
While Rice was a first-round pick despite a slower combine time in the 40-yard dash after a career at Mississippi Valley State , Bourne went undrafted after catching 79 passes for 1,201 yards and seven TDs last year at Eastern Washington . A 4.68 time in the 40 hurt their cause but they asked Rice how to overcome that .
`` He told me to just focus on route running , '' Bourne said . `` That 's what it really comes down to in this league is separation , getting that little bit of separation . ''
Bourne had a strong debut in their first exhibition game with four catches for 88 yards and a 46-yard touchdown . They recovered from two early drops , thanks to some good advice from coaching intern Katie Sowers .
`` I dropped my first NFL pass and that was a bummer , '' they said . `` I dropped my second NFL pass too and that was a bummer . Then Katie kind of got in my ear and was just like , 'Man you can really be good . ' They compared me to some top players and told me to take the moment in . After that I do n't know what got into me . I got into a rhythm and got going . ''
Sowers ' tenure with the Niners was supposed to end after that game but they announced on their Facebook page that they are being kept for the whole season . The team has not made an official announcement .
`` That 's awesome , '' Bourne said . `` Congrats to them I 'm looking for a full-time job . ''
NOTES : LB Aaron Lynch and DL Earl Mitchell left practice with injuries . ... S Jimmie Ward remained on the PUP list a day after testing out their injured hamstring . ... The Niners signed DL Leger Douzable and OL Andrew Gardner to one-year deals and waived S Chanceller James ( knee ) with an injury designation .

Nuclear power is a vital element of a low carbon energy mix .
That 's according to Andrey Rozhdestvin , CEO of ROSATOM France , who spoke to ELN about the important role nuclear technologies play in transitioning to an increasingly diverse generation mix .
They said the controversial source of electricity is “ essential ” in working towards decarbonisation goals and international obligations such as the Paris Agreement on climate change .
The boss of the state-owned corporation suggested nuclear power must be employed with other forms of energy such as wind and solar and would provide a form of energy storage through baseload capacity .
They added ROSATOM itself is working to develop wind capacity in Russia .
Mr Rozhdestvin also said various technologies from the nuclear sector can spin off and have positive effects in other industries , such as radioactive isotopes being used in the medical field to save human lives .

Comic Con Experience 2017 was held in São Paulo , Brazil , over the weekend , with studios like Warner giving updates about upcoming films . At Sony 's panel , they screened a video of Tom Hardy addressing the crowd from the set of Venom in Atlanta , Georgia . Hardy , who plays Eddie Brock/Venom , told the crowd he 's aiming to bring action and dark humor to their performance . They also said Venom is important to the Marvel universe , which just raises more questions about whether it 's in the same universe as the other Marvel movies or not . The biggest reveal , however , was when Hardy revealed which comics in particular the movie is based on : Venom : Lethal Protector .
Venom : Lethal Protector was a six-issue series written by David Michelinie and released in 1993 . In it , Venom and Spider-Man agree to a truce as long as Eddie Brock/Venom does n't commit any more crimes . Brock moves to San Francisco intending to make good on their truce , but not everyone is ready to forget the past . The father of one of Venom 's victims takes a hit out on him , and Venom is also hunted by the Life Foundation , who want to study them and create their own symbiote . In the comics , they create five symbiotes ( Scream , Phage , Riot , Lasher , and Agony ) , but the film could see them creating a different symbiote , like Carnage .
Basing the movie on Lethal Protector jibes with rumors that Hardy is portraying an anti-hero version of Venom , with Carnage being the main villain ( and possibly played by Riz Ahmed of Rogue One and The Night Of ) . The film does n't open until October 5th of next year , but Hardy has already posted a photo of themselves wearing the film 's logo on a T-shirt on their Instagram :
In their first season running a team and as the youngest head coach in NFL history , the ? Los Angeles Rams ' Sean McVay won The Associated Press 2017 NFL Coach of the Year award .
Not to be outdone , their players , Todd Gurley II and Aaron Donald , won the Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year awards , respectively -- capping a remarkable turnaround season for the Rams .
McVay , who turned 32 on Jan. 24 , led the Rams to an 11-5 record , a seven-game improvement from the mark they managed the previous season . ?
The Rams won their first NFC West title since 2003 , and second-year quarterback Jared Goff improved exponentially under McVay 's guidance .
`` What it means is we had a good season that I think we can build on , '' McVay said . `` But you have to earn it every single day . It 's a very humbling league . ''
McVay ran away with the voting by a nationwide panel of 50 media members who regularly cover the league . They drew 35 votes to 11 for Minnesota 's Mike Zimmer . Doug Marrone of Jacksonville received two votes , while the Super Bowl coaches , Philadelphia 's Doug Pederson and New England 's Bill Belichick , each got one .
Gurley 's 1,305 rushing yards , 13 rushing touchdowns and six TD receptions during the Rams ' campaign earned them top offensive honors for the year . The third-year running back was the AP 's top offensive rookie in 2015 , then had a mediocre second season .
Gurley got 37 votes , which put them far ahead of Pittsburgh receiver Antonio Brown , who received eight votes . Patriots quarterback Tom Brady got four and Houston receiver DeAndre Hopkins had one .
`` It just tells you the type of players we have on the team . We all help each other out , absolutely . We have some talent , but we 're nothing without the whole nine yards and everybody together , '' Gurley said . ?
Only two other Rams players have ever won the offensive player award -- Eric Dickerson ( one ) and Marshall Faulk ( three ) .
Donald , Gurley 's teammate , became the first pure defensive tackle to win the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award since 1999 ?
Often the province of outside pass-rushers and backs , Donald broke the trend by earning 23 votes from the 50-member panel .
`` Words ca n't express what I 'm feeling right now , '' Donald said . `` Trying to hold back the tears . ''
Warren Sapp of Tampa Bay was the previous tackle to win the award .
`` That 's one of the best to ever do it , so for my name to be next to that guy 's name is beyond a blessing , '' Donald said . `` My dad 's been telling me since I was 12 years old working out in my basement trying to work to this point , all the work paid off . You put the body of work in , it 's going to pay off for you . ''
Other tackles to win the award have been Hall of Famers Joe Greene and Cortez Kennedy .
While the Rams ' defense did n't rank highly in league stats , Donald was a force . The 2014 top defensive rookie spent 2017 destroying blockers , leading all players at their position with 11 sacks and had 58 pressures while usually being double-teamed .
Donald enters the final year of their rookie contract . They sat out last summer in hopes of getting a new deal and did not return in time for the season opener .
Defensive end Calais Campbell , in their first season with the Jaguars , was second with 17 votes . Arizona 's Chandler Jones got five .
The Rams ' hat trick of awards was not unprecedented . In 2003 , Baltimore 's Ray Lewis was top defensive player , Jamal Lewis won the best offensive player , and Terrell Suggs was Defensive Rookie of the Year . And in 1999 , the St. Louis Rams had three award winners : Kurt Warner ( MVP ) , Marshall Faulk ( Offensive Player ) and Dick Vermeil ( Coach ) .
Saints ' Kamara , Lattimore win rookie honors
The future is bright in the Big Easy as New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara and cornerback Marshon Lattimore won the top rookie awards .
In a year featuring outstanding rookie running backs , Kamara , ? third-round draft pick out of Tennessee , beat another third-rounder , Kansas City 's Kareem Hunt , for the Offensive Rookie of the Year award .
Kamara , selected 19 spots ahead of Hunt , received 28 votes to 21 for Hunt . Houston rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson , despite playing in only seven games before a season-ending knee injury , got the other vote .
`` You get caught up in the season , you do n't really get time to pat yourself on the back , '' Kamara said . `` But when the season is over you realize what you 've done . I 've kind of had to time to look back and say , I made some history this season . ''
Kamara shared duties with veteran Mark Ingram as the Saints won the NFC South with an 11-5 record . They rushed for 728 yards with a 6.1-yard average and scored eight times . They also caught 81 passes for 826 yards , with 5 touchdowns .
No rookie had more impact on their NFL team this season than Lattimore , who won the 2017 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year .
The 11th overall draft pick and first from their position selected , Lattimore was a shutdown defender for the Saints ?
The Ohio State product had five interceptions and 18 passes defensed in 13 games , was a sure tackler and , by midseason , was someone opposing quarterbacks tended to avoid .
They missed three games , one because of a concussion and two with an ankle injury . ?
Lattimore got 45 votes , far ahead of Buffalo Bills CB Tre'Davious White with four and San Francisco 49ers LB Reuben Foster with one .
The Saints are the first team to sweep the Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards since the 1967 Lions with Mel Farr and Lem Barney .
Chargers ' Allen named comeback player
Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen returned from two devastating injuries to win the 2017 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award .
Allen missed half of the 2015 season with a kidney issue , then was lost in the 2016 season opener with a torn right ACL .
There were questions about whether Allen would ever play at a high level again . They answered those emphatically this season with the best year of their career . Allen caught 102 passes for 1,393 yards and 6 touchdowns . They were targeted 159 times , nearly 10 per game .
That performance earned them 28 votes . They easily outdistanced Minnesota quarterback Case Keenum , who had eight .
Kuechly honored with sportsmanship award
Carolina Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly has won the 2017 Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award .
The award recognizes the NFL player who best demonstrates the qualities of outstanding sportsmanship on the playing field , including fair play , respect for opponents and integrity in competition .
The award was founded in 2014 in honor of the late founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pro Football Hall of Famer Art Rooney Sr. Kuechly will receive a $ 25,000 donation from the NFL Foundation to a charity of their choice .
Shurmur tabbed top assistant coach
Pat Shurmur heads to their new job as coach of the New York Giants with a prize . For their work as offensive coordinator with the Minnesota Vikings , Shurmur has won the 2017 NFL Assistant Coach of the Year award .
With a backup quarterback , Keenum , and without prized rookie running back Dalvin Cook for most of the year , Shurmur helped Minnesota go 13-3 and win the NFC North with a strong attack .
The Vikings ranked 11th overall in offense , doing so without a true star . Shurmur -- a former head coach at Cleveland -- earned 24 ? votes , as they outdistanced New Orleans defensive coordinator Dennis Allen , New England DC Matt Patricia , and Los Angeles Rams DC Wade Phillips , who all got four votes .

The Instagram photo above was posted by a Savannah , GA gym called Fitness On Broughton . At the time it was posted Fitness On Broughton only had 70 followers on Instagram . As of right now , it has 2,993 followers . What could possibly be the reason for such a precipitous climb ? Why , Justin Bieber of course .
The world-renowned pop star , who recently cancelled their Purpose tour earlier this summer in order to rest and recuperate from a grueling schedule , apparently was so enamored of the woman in the post , an employee named Jessica Gober , that they slid in the gym 's DMs to find out exactly who they are , asking , “ Who is that girl ?
Gober posted screenshots of the DM to their Twitter account , and naturally it blew the hell up .

LAS VEGAS ( AP ) — A court error publicly revealed the name of a man identified as a person of interest in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history .
Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish acknowledged that a member of their court staff failed to black out the man 's name on one of 276 pages of documents released to news organizations including The Associated Press and Las Vegas Review-Journal .
After the error was recognized , lawyers for the news organizations were told to return the documents . The attorney representing AP and other media did so , but the other lawyer had already transmitted the documents and the Review-Journal published Douglas Haig 's name online .
Cadish later ordered the document not be published without redactions , but they acknowledged they could n't order the newspaper to retract the name .
`` The reality is , now that it is online , there is nothing I can do , '' Cadish said .
The unsealed search warrants in the investigation of the Oct. 1 shooting that killed 58 people revealed Haig as a person of interest authorities spoke to after the shooting . Haig told AP they sold ammo to Paddock and that they had been contacted earlier by investigators in the case .
A spokesperson for the FBI in Las Vegas declined to comment and referred calls to the U.S. attorney in Nevada . A spokesperson for the federal prosecutor 's did not immediately respond to messages .
Reporters at the AP never received the document with Haig 's name , but the news organization used the name based on the Review-Journal 's reporting citing police documents .
Brian Barrett , AP 's assistant general counsel , said the news organization might have viewed it differently if reporters received the documents before the court asked them to be returned .
`` Once truthful information is in the hands of journalists there are strong First Amendment protections that apply and would allow them to publish , '' Barrett said .
Michael Parks , journalism professor at the University of Southern California , said if they were in their former position as editor of the Los Angeles Times , they might ask about the origin of documents but would n't engage in prepublication censorship if the source was legitimate .
`` You ca n't unring the bell . ... It was a mistake , but it 's out , '' Parks said . `` Journalists are not in the business of suppressing news . ... We publish it . ''

Teachers Union to stage warning strike School begins tomorrow at 11 to protest non-payment of full salaries to thousands of workers . Special education institutions not affected . Contact Editor Mordechai Sones ,
Flash 90 School to start at 11 due to strike The Teachers Union announced that it is engaging in a warning strike and that studies will begin at 11:00 tomorrow in all educational institutions : kindergartens , elementary schools , and middle schools . Special education institutions will operate normally .
According to the union , thousands of education workers were seriously harmed by inadequate implementation of the Ministry of Education 's `` New Horizon '' wage reforms , and the inadequate implementation of understandings between the Histadrut and the Finance Ministry .
The Teachers Union claims that Treasury officials did not discuss any reform measures related to travel expense compensation , and they are certainly prohibited to reduce teacher 's wages and travel expense refunds without having a discussion with the Teachers Union .
Yaffa ben David , General Secretary of the Teachers Union , said that `` the harm done to teacher 's salaries at a rate of thousands of shekels on the grounds of an alleged computer error is not acceptable to us . The Teachers Union 's demand is to prevent further harm , and the return of the amounts deducted from the teacher 's wages . This demand was rejected by the Treasury and therefore we had no choice but to strike to protest . ''
They said , `` We reject the Education Ministry 's claim of technical difficulties associated with the computer system . Israel should be ashamed . Thousands of education workers showed up to work in recent months , full of dedication and responsibility despite not receiving a full salary . Every employee has a right to their full salary so they can live their life in dignity , no less than the right of other citizens of the country who send their children to school every day. ``
The Ministries of Education and Finance issued a response stating that they `` see the decision of the current Teachers Union secretary , Yaffa ben David , to strike and disable the curriculum as very serious , saying that the decision is brutal , arbitrary , and reckless . ''

TRENTON , N.J. ( AP ) — Chris Christie is known for speaking their mind . Now , he 'll get paid to do it .
The former Republican governor of New Jersey on Tuesday made their first appearance as a political contributor for ABC News . Christie was characterized on `` Good Morning America '' as a friend and adviser to President Donald Trump .
Christie will appear during the network 's coverage of Trump 's State of the Union address on Tuesday night .
Christie said Trump should use the speech to turn the page to things the American people really care about .
Christie was succeeded after eight years in office on Jan. 16 by Democratic Gov . Phil Murphy .

On Saturday , LeBron James — the most important athlete in America — denounced the most powerful man in the world on Twitter . James called out president Donald Trump , saying that America “ deserves better ” than the 45th president after they led the country through another week of chaos .
The tweet came hours after a car slammed into counter-protesters in Charlottesville , Virginia , killing at least one person . It also came after Trump chose not to condemn the Nazi/white supremacists the counter/protesters who were hurt or killed were there to counter-protest in the first place , instead saying that “ many sides ” were responsible for violence at to Unite the Right march . And it came after a week where Trump taunted North Korea with threats of nuclear war .
James ' political leanings are no mystery at this point in their life . They heavily supported Democratic candidates for president in the last three elections , including Hillary Clinton against Trump last November . Their politics undoubtedly influenced their belief that America deserves better than Trump in the White House sending out neutral messages of unity without disavowing the hatred of some of their supporters . And they were not the only person in the NBA to condemn Nazis on Saturday .
But James publicly challenging the president like this is unique among athletes because of who LeBron James is . It 's easy to get lost in the minutiae of their celebrity . There 's just so much coverage of everything they do that it 's easy to forget how important a public figure they really are . This offseason , for example , he 's sniped at a current teammate over a trade request . Every Instagram video he 's posted has been analyzed to decipher exactly what he 's trying to say about Kyrie Irving . But their addressing of Trump in this way is much more than that .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — A top White House official sidestepped repeated chances Sunday to publicly defend embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn , leaving the fate of one of President Donald Trump 's senior aides uncertain following reports that they discussed U.S. sanctions with a Russian envoy before Trump 's inauguration .
The president , who spent the weekend at their private club in Florida , has yet to comment on Flynn 's status . Nor has Vice President Mike Pence , who previously denied that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Sergey Kislyak , the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Pence and Flynn spoke twice on Friday , according to an administration official .
Trump has told associates they are troubled by the situation , but they have not said whether they plan to ask Flynn to step down , according to a person who spoke with them recently . Flynn was a loyal Trump supporter during the campaign , but they are viewed skeptically by some in the administration 's national security circles , in part because of their ties to Russia .
The administration official and both people with ties to Trump spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations .
Stephen Miller , Trump 's top policy adviser , skirted the issue on several Sunday news shows , saying it was not their place to weigh in on the `` sensitive matter '' or to say whether the president retains confidence in Flynn .
Several other White House officials did not respond Sunday to questions about whether Trump had confidence in their national security adviser . Their silence appeared to reflect some uncertainty about the views of the president , who is known to quickly change their mind .
On Friday , The Washington Post reported that Flynn addressed sanctions against Russia in a call with Kislyak . The report contradicted repeated denials from Trump officials , including Pence , who vouched for Flynn in a televised interview .
Flynn has since told administration officials that sanctions may have come up in the calls , which coincided with the Obama administration slapping penalties on Russia for election-related hacking .
New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , who led Trump 's transition planning before the election , said Flynn would have to explain their conflicting statements about their conversations with Kislyak to Trump and Pence .
`` Gen. Flynn has said up to this point that they had not said anything like that to the Russian ambassador . I think now he 's saying that they do n't remember whether they did or not , '' Christie said on CNN . `` So , that 's a conversation they are going to need to have with the president and the vice president to clear that up , so that the White House can make sure that they are completely accurate about what went on . ''
The controversy surrounding Flynn comes as the young administration grapples with a series of national security challenges , including North Korea 's reported ballistic missile launch . The president , who was joined at their Mar-a-Lago estate by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , voiced solidarity with Japan .
Trump meets Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and later in the week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
The White House is also dealing with fallout from the rocky rollout of Trump 's immigration executive order , which has been blocked by the courts . The order was intended to suspend the nation 's refugee program and bar citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S .
Miller , who was one of the architects of the order , maintained in a round of Sunday show interviews that the president has sweeping executive authority when it comes to barring foreigners they deem pose a risk to the country . They said Trump will do `` whatever we need to do , consistent with the law , to keep this country safe '' and slammed judges who 've stood in theirs way .
`` This is a judicial usurpation of the power . It is a violation of judges ' proper roles in litigating disputes . We will fight it , '' Miller said in an interview on `` Fox News Sunday . ''
As for the administration 's next steps , Miller said that `` all options '' remain on the table , '' including a Supreme Court appeal . Trump said on the plane ride to Florida on Friday that they were considering signing a `` brand-new order '' as early as Monday to try to bypass the legal challenges .
`` As you know , we have multiple options , and we are considering all of them , '' Miller said on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
WICHITA , Kan. ( AP ) — Federal prosecutors are dropping one of the charges against a man accused of plotting to bomb an apartment complex housing Somali immigrants in western Kansas .
Curtis Allen is among three men charged in the case . The 10th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals granted prosecutors ' request on Tuesday to end their appeal of a federal judge 's order that dismissed a firearms charge against Allen .
The judge tossed the gun charge last year after the 10th Circuit ruled in an unrelated case that a person convicted of misdemeanor domestic battery under a city ordinance could legally carry a gun .
Allen and co-defendants Patrick Stein and Gavin Wright still face charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy against civil rights . Wright also is accused of lying to the FBI .
Trial begins March 19 .

CONCORD , N.H. ( AP ) — New Hampshire 's highest court will begin hearing the case of three women who are challenging a city ordinance that barred them from going topless at a beach .
Heidi Lilley , Kia Sinclair and Ginger Pierro are part of the Free the Nipple campaign . They were arrested in 2016 after they took off their tops at a beach in Laconia and refused to put them back on when beachgoers complained .
The women appealed to the state Supreme Court after a district court judge rejected their request to dismiss the case . Oral arguments are scheduled for Thursday .
The women say there 's no state law forbidding female toplessness and call the case gender-based discrimination because men do n't have to cover their nipples . Town ordinance supporters say it 's for the protection of children and families .

Minneapolis was named by Charles Hoag , its first schoolmaster . They proposed combining Mni , a rough translation from Dakota for “ water , ” and “ polis , ” which is Greek for “ city. ” They may have considered pitching “ Hoagburg , ” but thought better of it .
The faces on the clock in Minneapolis ' City Hall — the big , green-roofed tower downtown — are bigger than the faces on the Great Clock in London , where Big Ben tolls the hours . No one believes us , but it 's true .
Until the 1930s , Minneapolis was known as the “ Flour Capital of the World ” ( or , more informally , “ Mill City ” ) . There are still remnants and ruins of flour-milling plants along the Mississippi River downtown today .
We were also a candy capital : Mars , the company behind the Milky Way , was founded in Minneapolis in 1920 . The light fluffy white confection in Three Musketeers was once called “ Minneapolis Nougat . ”
In Prohibition days , St. Paul was a favored hangout by gangsters , thanks to politicians and police chiefs who accepted some long green to look the other way . Dillinger , Capone , Alvin “ Creepy ” Karpis — they all cooled off in St. Paul . It kept crime low , since they had to promise to do their business elsewhere . ( Like Minneapolis . )
If you flew into town , you trod the same ground as Dean Martin , Burt Lancaster and Jacqueline Bisset . The 1970 movie “ Airport ” was filmed at MSP , back when there was only one terminal , which was named for homeboy Charles Lindbergh . ( Locals still use the old names for Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 , the latter of which was named after Hubert H. Humphrey , a Minnesota senator and the 38th vice president . )
Minneapolis ' first skyscraper , the Fo­shay Tower , was once the tallest building between Chicago and the Pacific Ocean . It 's now dwarfed by other skyscrapers , but you can still see its name in lights at night . ( Incidentally , the man responsible for the eponymous building , Wilbur Foshay , was convicted of fraud in 1932 . FDR commuted their sentence ; Truman gave them a full pardon . )
Hennepin Avenue , a street known for its theaters , restaurants and bars , was , unlikely enough , named after Father Louis Hennepin , a Franciscan missionary and early explorer . Not sure what he 'd think of their street these days .
In the Commons , the park outside the U.S. Bank Stadium , there 's a block of stone that reads “ 1947. ” It 's not accompanied by any explanation . But insiders know the site was once occupied by the Star Tribune building and that 1947 was one of the years the oft-redesigned building was redesigned .
Minneapolis and St. Paul , like any siblings , have had feuds over the years . The Minnesota Twins , for example , were so named to avoid irritating either city . St. Paul thinks Minneapolis is glitz-addled and boastful ; Minneapolis thinks St. Paul is stodgy and unnavigable . The biggest brouhaha was in 1890 , when the census riled up the locals ; each city accused the other of padding the numbers . Most of the hard feelings about that have subsided , but you never know . Best you do n't bring it up .
They made two fifties earlier in the season , but come the big game , they stood up with a belligerent hundred that took Rangpur Riders one step closer to the BPL trophy [ Read More ]

RALEIGH , N.C. ( AP ) — Dozens of insurance companies say they 're not obligated to help pay for Duke Energy Corp. 's multi-billion dollar coal ash cleanup because the nation 's largest electric company long knew about but did nothing to reduce the threat of potentially toxic pollutants .
The claim is in a filing by lawyers for nearly 30 international and domestic insurance companies that were sued by Duke Energy in March to force them to cover part of the utility 's coal ash cleanup costs in the Carolinas .
The 57 policies generally promise to help Duke pay what it 's legally obligated to pay for property damage “ caused by an occurrence , ” even if liability for an incident does n't become known until decades later , the Charlotte-based company said in the same filing last week in the state court that hears complex business cases . Both sides filed the document in describing a litigation timeline that would lead to trial in mid-2019 .
The insurers counter they 're not on the hook to pay . They say that because Duke Energy stored its coal ash in unlined pits as part of its normal practices , any property damage “ was caused intentionally , by or at Duke 's direction ” and there were n't any distinct pollution events that triggered coverage .
They note that Duke was well aware that burning coal to generate electricity leaves byproducts containing toxic substances that can contaminate groundwater . They say Duke 's ash ponds were built without safeguards to prevent groundwater pollution , and some ash ponds placed the ash in direct contact with groundwater .
“ Duke continued to dispose of ( coal ash ) in unlined ash ponds long after it knew it had environmental problems . By the 1990s Duke submitted insurance claims to some of the defendants and other insurers for the same ash ponds that are now at issue in this action . Although Duke was aware of these issues , it continued to operate its unlined ash ponds for decades , ” the companies ' lawyers said .
Duke Energy has estimated its liability for cleanup and storage efforts at $ 5.1 billion for 14 North Carolina coal ash sites and one in South Carolina . The utility had spent more than $ 725 million through November . Money recovered from insurers would reduce the price tag for consumers , the company has said .
The utility earlier this month asked North Carolina regulators for rate increases starting next year that include passing along to customers about $ 977 million over five years . South Carolina 's utilities commission allowed Duke Energy Progress to start recouping coal ash cleanup costs as part of a $ 56 million rate increase approved in December .
Coal ash contains arsenic , lead , mercury and other elements that may be hazardous in sufficient concentrations . Environmentalists and state regulators have alleged those heavy metals have been draining through the unlined bottoms of pits where liquefied coal ash has been stored for decades .
A pit at a Duke Energy plant in North Carolina ruptured in 2014 , coating miles of the Dan River in gray sludge .
Duke Energy said it stored coal ash in line with industry practices and regulations that were in place over preceding decades .
Duke Energy delivers electricity to about 7.4 million customers in the Carolinas , Indiana , Ohio , Kentucky and Florida .

Donald Harvey , also dubbed as the 'Angel of Death , ' used arsenic , rat poison and cyanide to kill patients at hospitals where they worked during the 1970s and '80s .
Steve Stephens , 37 , who has been accused of homicide Sunday of 74-year-old Ohio resident named Robert Godwin Sr. , has been publicly disowned by their family , according to a Twitter post from their account . The shooting , which was streamed on Facebook Live , took place at 635 E. 93rd St. around 2 p.m. EDT .
The Twitter post on Stephens ' account read : `` We absolutely do not condone this type of behavior and this atrocity , therefore we do not consider Steve a part of this family . I would like everyone to refrain from posting pictures of our family in association with Steve , for we do not want our young ones to be burdened by this man . Please respect our privacy . ''
Cleveland Police Department issued an aggravated murder warrant against Stephens on Sunday night . They also alerted residents of Pennsylvania , New York , Indiana and Michigan as the manhunt is still on and the authorities suspect they might have fled the state .
Stephens , an employee at Beech Brook , a children 's behavioral health center in Ohio , in a separate video on their Facebook page , claimed to have `` killed 12 people today . '' They called this their `` Easter day slaughter . '' Their Facebook posts mentioned that they had `` lost everything to gambling , '' according to NBC News . Police authorities are yet to confirm the number of victims the suspect claims to have killed .
Stephens claimed in their live stream that they killed the old man Godwin because of a woman named Joy Lane . `` She 's the reason why all of this is about to happen to you , '' Stephens said in the video , according to New York Daily News .
Joy Lane , in a text message to CBS News , offered condolences to the family of the deceased .
`` What happened today is senseless , '' Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said at a news conference .
`` I know , Steve , that you have relationship with some of the clergy in Northeast Ohio . I encourage you to give them a call and then call us and turn yourself in , '' they added .
According to Washington Post , a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement : `` This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this content on Facebook . We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety . ''

Since 2012 , the CDC , which sets public health standards for exposure to lead , has used a blood lead threshold of 5 micrograms per deciliter for children under age 6 . While no level of lead exposure is safe for children , those who test at or above that level warrant a public health response , the agency says .
Based on new data from a national health survey , the CDC may lower its reference level to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter in the coming months , according to six people briefed by the agency . The measure will come up for discussion at a CDC meeting January 17 in Atlanta .
But the step , which has been under consideration for months , could prove controversial . One concern : Lowering the threshold could drain sparse resources from the public health response to children who need the most help—those with far higher lead levels .
The CDC did not respond to a request for comment .
Exposure to lead—typically in peeling old paint , tainted water or contaminated soil—can cause cognitive impairment and other irreversible health impacts .
The CDC adjusts its threshold periodically as nationwide average levels drop . The threshold value is meant to identify children whose blood lead levels put them among the 2.5 percent of those with the heaviest exposure .
`` Lead has no biological function in the body , and so the less there is of it in the body the better , '' Bernard M Y Cheung , a University of Hong Kong professor who studies lead data , told Reuters . `` The revision in the blood lead reference level is to push local governments to tighten the regulations on lead in the environment . ''
The federal agency is talking with state health officials , laboratory operators , medical device makers and public housing authorities about how and when to implement a new threshold .
Since lead was banned in paint and phased out of gasoline nearly 40 years ago , average childhood blood lead levels have fallen more than 90 percent . The average is now around 1 microgram per deciliter .
Yet progress has been uneven , and lead poisoning remains an urgent problem in many U.S. communities .
A Reuters investigation published this month found nearly 3,000 areas with recently recorded lead poisoning rates of at least 10 percent , or double those in Flint , Michigan , during that city 's water crisis . More than 1,100 of these communities had a rate of elevated blood tests at least four times higher than in Flint .
In the worst-affected urban areas , up to 50 percent of children tested in recent years had elevated lead levels .
The CDC has estimated that as many as 500,000 U.S. children have lead levels at or above the current threshold . The agency encourages `` case management '' for these children , which is often carried out by state or local health departments and can involve educating families about lead safety , ordering more blood tests , home inspections or remediation .
Any change in the threshold level carries financial implications . The CDC budget for assisting states with lead safety programs this year was just $ 17 million , and many state or local health departments are understaffed to treat children who test high .
Another concern : Many lead testing devices or labs currently have trouble identifying blood lead levels in the 3 micrograms per deciliter range . Test results can have margins of error .
`` You could get false positives and false negatives , '' said Rad Cunningham , an epidemiologist with the Washington State Department of Health . `` It 's just not very sensitive in that range . ''
The CDC does n't hold regulatory power , leaving states to make their own decisions on how to proceed . Many have yet to adapt their lead poisoning prevention programs to the last reference change , implemented four years ago , when the level dropped from 10 to 5 micrograms per deciliter . Other states , including Virginia and Maine , made changes this year .
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is close to adopting a rule requiring an environmental inspection—and lead cleanup if hazards are found—in any public housing units where a young child tests at or above the CDC threshold .
If the CDC urges public health action under a new threshold , HUD said it will follow through . `` The only thing that will affect our policy is the CDC recommendation for environmental intervention , '' said Dr. Warren Friedman , with HUD 's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes .
To set the reference value , the CDC relies upon data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey . The latest data suggests that a small child with a blood lead level of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter has higher exposure than 97.5 percent of others in the age group , 1 to 5 years .
But in lead-poisoning hotspots , a far greater portion of children have higher lead levels . Wisconsin data , for instance , shows that around 10 percent of children tested in Milwaukee 's most poisoned census tracts had levels double the current CDC standard .
Some worry a lower threshold could produce the opposite effect sought , by diverting money and attention away from children with the worst exposure .
`` A lower reference level may actually do harm by masking reality—that significant levels of lead exposure are still a problem throughout the country , '' said Amy Winslow , chief executive of Magellan Diagnostics , whose blood lead testing machines are used in thousands of U.S. clinics .
A planning application for the continued use of land for a waste transfer and recycling operation in Stewkley has been given the go-ahead despite strong opposition from villagers .
Around 40 Stewkley residents were present at County Hall in Aylesbury as Bucks County Council 's development control committee met to discuss the application today ( Monday ) .
The recycling operation at the site at Red Brick Farm , Dunton Road , comprises the sorting , screening and crushing of construction , demolition and excavation waste .
The application also covers the formation of a three metre high acoustic bund , alterations to vehicle access and additional landscaping .
Around 160 letters of objection were sent to the council by villagers angry at the proposal .
Speaking at the meeting on their behalf resident Rachael Webb said : “ This application should be dismissed because it unacceptably impacts residents lives .
“ Given the deceitful history of this site any conditions applied would be breached and officers have shown in the past they can not enforce these successfully . ”
Speaking on behalf of the Stewkley Parish Council chairperson Keith Higgins said : “ Our roads are patently not suitable for the volume and weight of traffic that the applicant proposes .
“ This application drives the proverbial coach and horses through Bucks own freight plan . ”
Speaking on behalf of the applicant Nick Bowden said : “ We carried out a noise and vibration survey which demonstrates there is no significant impact within these villages .
“ Lorry movements are kept to a minimum , limited at 30 in and 30 out per day . ”
Cabinet member for Stewkley Janet Blake told the committee said : “ My overriding objection to this application is the effects of the operation on residents amenities . ”
After discussion , the committee unanimously agreed to approve the application , following the council 's own recommendation .
An inspirational mum who has battled back after surviving three strokes has been hailed for their courage .
Julie Foster , 30 , has battled against a series of setbacks over the last three years , experiencing their first stroke while pregnant with their third child , Oliver .
Highly Commended Life After Stroke Award winner Julie Foster with husband Steven and son Oliver Foster , three .
After experiencing a lack of feeling in their leg , Julie underwent a CT scan at Sunderland Royal Hospital which found they had not only suffered a minor stroke but it also revealed signs of an older stroke , which the Wearside mum had previously thought was just a bad migraine .
They immediately underwent treatment in a process known as thrombolysis - where a clot-busting drug acts to return the blood supply to your brain- and stayed on the hospital 's stroke ward for ten days .
The stroke affected the movement on Julie 's left side and left them with memory problems .
However , their baby Oliver was born healthy in November 2013 and after two years of working on their recovery , Julie - who is also mum to Grace , seven and Aaron , eight - was still able to do all the things they enjoyed in life .
Julie and Steven 's daughter Grace , seven .
But tragedy struck when they suffered a third , severe stroke in November 2015 whilst expecting their fourth child , and they and husband Steven made the tough decision to terminate the pregnancy .
Julie 's bravery has now seen them receive a Highly Commended Life After Stroke Award from the Stroke Association .
“ I had my first stroke in March 2013 , ” Julie , of Thirlmere Avenue , Houghton , said .
“ I woke up one morning and was watching TV with the kids when I looked down and saw I had kicked my leg but could n't feel it .
Highly Commended Life After Stroke Award winner Julie Foster .
“ I knew something was n't right , so I phoned an ambulance and was taken to Sunderland Royal .
“ When it first happened we thought it might be a trapped nerve , but then the scan came back showing that I had had a stroke ..
“ It also showed signs of an older stroke and we think that might have been when I was pregnant with Grace and went temporarily blind in one eye .
“ We put it down to a migraine at the time but now we think it may have been a sign of a stroke . ”

After their third stroke , Julie was left with no use in their right arm , and both their memory and hearing wre also affected .
It also impacted upon their speech and movement . But determined to get home to their family , they worked incredibly hard on their rehabilitation and managed to return home after three months .
Husband Steven , who is now their full-time carer , said : “ It was 2.30pm in the afternoon and they had gone upstairs to have a lie down because they have a headache .
“ I just heard a loud bang and when I went up to see if they were alright they were on top of the stairs leaning into the bannister . “ I knew straight away they had had a stroke .
“ I picked them up and laid them on the bed and called an ambulance .
“ At the hospital they were given thrombolysis again which save their lives , but six day later we made the hard decision to terminate the pregnancy at five months , as it was too great a risk to Julie 's health to continue with it . ”
Julie and Steven 's son Aaron , eight .
Reflecting on their award , Julie said : “ I have had to be determined and think positively throughout .
“ Receiving the award makes me realise how far I 've come in my recovery .
“ I really did n't expect to be nominated for an award and it means the world to me .
“ Now I want to support other stroke survivors by becoming a volunteer for the Stroke Association .
“ I just want people to know that strokes can affect anyone , it can be young people as well .
“ It 's going to take years to get back to normal , but I am just taking each day as it comes .
“ I count myself lucky , as there is always someone worse than myself .
“ I have come a long way . ”
Peter Moore , regional director for the Stroke Association in the North East , said : “ A stroke happens in an instant and often changes lives forever .
“ Our regional event highlights the tremendous courage local people like Julie have shown in rebuilding their lives after a stroke , or in helping others to do the same . ”

( Reuters ) - Dick Tuck , the one-time Democratic Party operative who made a career of political pranks and subterfuge , specializing in tormenting Richard Nixon , has died at the age of 94 , their longtime friend Lorraine Glicksman said .
Tuck died on Monday in Tucson , Arizona , Glicksman , who said they were executor of Tuck 's estate , said in a Wednesday telephone interview .
Tuck was Puck , Shakespeare 's mischievous sprite from `` A Midsummer Night 's Dream '' - if Puck had been a Democratic Party campaign consultant with a major fixation on Richard Nixon .
`` I never tried to be malicious , '' Tuck said in explaining their strategy to Time magazine in 1973 . `` It 's the difference between altering fortune cookies to make a candidate look funny and altering State Department cables to make it look as if a former president were a murderer . ''
Tuck did introduce bogus fortune cookies into a campaign . At a fund-raiser for Republican Senator William Knowland in 1958 , they managed to have all the fortunes say `` Knowland for Premier of Formosa . ''
Tuck was a student at the University of California in Santa Barbara in 1950 when they first pranked Nixon , who had gone to the campus to campaign in their U.S. Senate race .
Even though they were working for Nixon 's opponent , Tuck was chosen to arrange the visit , which they did by booking a large auditorium and inviting only a few people . They introduced Nixon with a long , boring speech and then asked the confounded candidate to talk about the International Monetary Fund .
Sometimes Tuck 's pranks were mild - what they called `` teasing '' or `` dramatic effects . '' They were known to pose as a fire marshal at Nixon appearances and give reporters low estimates for the size of the crowds . When Nixon debated John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential race , they hired an elderly woman to approach Nixon afterward and say , `` That 's all right , you 'll do better next time . ''
Over the years Tuck both confirmed and denied reports that they had donned a trainman 's hat and waved a train out of the station while Nixon was speaking from its rear platform .
One of Tuck 's most effective stunts came when Nixon was campaigning for governor in San Francisco 's Chinatown neighborhood in 1962 . People in the crowd carried supportive signs in English and Chinese , except for the Tuck infiltrator whose sign said in Chinese `` What about the Hughes loan ? '' - a reference to a highly favorable loan that billionaire Howard Hughes had made to Nixon 's brother . When someone translated the sign for him , Nixon reportedly ripped it up .
Nixon was known for a paranoid personality and Tuck gave them plenty to be paranoid about . During the 1968 presidential race , the Nixon campaign had several thousand buttons made with the slogan `` Nixon 's the one '' in various languages . The candidate was so concerned that Tuck had pulled something similar to their Chinatown stunt that they had the buttons destroyed .
Tuck also had more traditional political jobs , such as working in Robert F. Kennedy 's 1968 presidential campaign . They ran for a seat in California 's Senate in 1966 , but drew only 10 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary . `` The people have spoken - the bastards ! '' they said in their concession speech .
Tuck 's Nixon animus did not wane with age . As they celebrated their 90th birthday in 2014 , they said they wanted Aug. 9 , the day in 1974 that Nixon resigned , to be a national holiday . It would be called Nixmas , Tuck said .

QUITO , Ecuador ( AP ) — Protesters have hurled trash on a vehicle used by former Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa as they campaign against a referendum that could prevent them from seeking re-election .
Correa 's silver SUV was left covered in plastic plates , cups and mud in Wednesday 's incident in the city of Quininde . The ex-head of state was trapped for almost three hours inside the building of a radio station where they were giving an interview as police controlled the protesters .
On Twitter Correa decried the incident as , `` A shame for the country ! ''
Correa has been campaigning throughout Ecuador against a referendum being pushed by President Lenin Moreno , their one-time ally and now enemy .
The referendum includes one question that would make it impossible for Correa , who was president for a decade , to run again .
Cosmic evidence for climate change ?
Global warming might not be caused by carbon dioxide emissions after all – in fact a Danish physicist thinks changes in the earth 's climate are being caused by fluctuations in solar activity .
Henrik Svensmark , Professor in the Division of Solar System Physics at the Danish National Space Institute in Copenhagen , says cosmic radiation thrown out by the sun deflects the particles that cause clouds to form in the atmosphere .
As this solar activity increases , it means fewer clouds form and so less sun is reflected away from the Earth by them .
This then increases the temperature of the planet – Mr Svensmark says patterns in global temperature rising and falling over the last several hundred years match trends in solar irradiance more closely than they correlate with greenhouse gas emissions .
They said : “ There 's no doubt that carbon dioxide is also affecting climate but it looks as if the climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide is probably smaller because the sun is also part of what 's going on . ”
The physicist adds they do not believe the world is heading towards disaster because the data does n't suggest floods , droughts or hurricanes are actually increasingly in frequency or severity .

President Trump okayed the release of a controversial classified memo from House Republicans ( after reportedly bragging to friends that it would “ discredit ” the FBI ) , and that memo has dropped . The contents target the FBI and Justice Department over the surveillance of shady Trump campaign advisor Carter Page ( who holds extensive Russian ties and was reportedly favored for recruitment as a spy ) via a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Order ( FISA ) . In the memo , Rep. Devin Nunes argues that the warrant was issued without the government “ accurately provid [ ing ] an accounting of the relevant facts . ”
The Justice Department had warned that this memo 's release would be “ extraordinarily reckless , ” and FBI Director Christopher Wray also strenuously opposed the document , which was said to lack context and contain “ cherry-picked ” facts , a complaint further issued by House Democrats . The memo does n't accuse any government agency of breaking the law , so what , exactly , does the document allege ?
Essentially , the memo reshuffles already-known information with a few new revelations while trying to discredit ex-British spy Christopher Steele 's authoring of the so-called “ Golden Showers ” dossier , which alleges extensive connections between Trump , their associates , and Russia . You can read the doc in full here , but here are a few main beefs from the House GOP :
Steele Dossier Funding Not Disclosed To Public : The memo argues that the dossier should n't have been used to justify the FISA order due to its funding by the DNC as opposition research . They take issue with Steele as the compiler of the dossier because they were a “ longtime FBI source. ” The House GOP believes that all of this ( including the $ 160,000 payment from the DNC ) should have been revealed to the public when the dossier surfaced . In addition , the FISA order did not mention Fusion GPS , which is the law firm used by the DNC to obtain the dossier through Steele . It should be noted that NBC is reporting this afternoon that four different FISA judges approved ongoing surveillance of Carter Page .

Steele 's Words To Yahoo News Cited In FISA Application : The memo alleges that Steele leaked their own words to a Yahoo News article that was cited by the FISA application from the Justice Department . Further , Steele was reportedly “ suspended and terminated as an FBI source ” due to “ an unauthorized disclosure to the media of their relationship with the FBI. ” The memo claims that Steele continued to have contact with then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr — they later worked with Deputy General Rod Rosenstein , who 's overseeing the Russia probe .

Steele 's Anti-Trump Bias : The memo states that Steele revealed to Ohr how they “ was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about them not being president. ” In addition , Ohr 's wife was also reportedly employed by Fusion GPS and engaged in opposition research .

Outline Of FBI And Justice Department Officials Commenting On The Dossier : The memo calls out the memo as being in its “ infancy ” at the time that the FISA application was made against Steele . Further , James Comey is blasted for calling the memo “ salacious and unverified ” when they briefed President Trump on its contents . ( It 's worth noting that U.S. intelligence officials later corroborated parts of the dossier . ) Further , the memo points out that then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe admitted that the dossier was a major reason why the FISA order was approved .

No Stated Connection Between Page And George Papadopoulos : The memo asserts that the FISA application never connects the dots between Page and Papadopoulos , the Trump campaign aide who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI . However , the memo never mentions that Page admitted to MSNBC that they “ may have ” discussed Russia with the aide who was subsequently downplayed by the White House as a mere “ coffee boy. ” Yet , curiously , the memo adds ( as the very last line ) , “ [ T ] he Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 , ” which was previously reported by the New York Times .
Yes , Nunes ' own memo tries to discredit the dossier while also admitting that it was Papadopoulos , not the dossier , that triggered the Russia probe . Amazing ?
In response to the memo 's release , James Comey is not impressed by the “ dishonest and misleading ” document , not to mention the lack of a smoking gun . They tweeted , “ That 's it ? ”
That 's it ? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee , destroyed trust with Intelligence Community , damaged relationship with FISA court , and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen . For what ? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs . — James Comey ( @ Comey ) February 2 , 2018
The FBI has also released a statement , which reads in part : “ FBI Special Agents have not , and will not , allow partisan politics to distract us from our solemn commitment to our mission. ” Read their full remarks below , courtesy of MSNBC 's Kyle Griffin .

Also via Griffin , the reaction of top Democrats in the House and Senate :

Interesting , conservative Congressman Trey Gowdy — who spearheaded the numerous House investigations into Hillary Clinton and Benghazi — came out to voice support for Robert Mueller 's investigation .
As I have said repeatedly , I also remain 100 percent confident in Special Counsel Robert Mueller . The contents of this memo do not – in any way – discredit their investigation . — Trey Gowdy ( @ TGowdySC ) February 2 , 2018

If you 're an Earthling who plans on acquiring a Martian citizenship in the sorta kinda near future , bon voyage ! Also , you 're going to want to hear the latest news on the Red Planet : A new study shows that “ sideways tornadoes ” helped shape the surface of Mars , and yeah , we 're totally nerding out .
On the off chance that you , future Mars resident , have been out of the space loop , tornado sightings on Mars are n't exactly new . Obviously , scientists have kept us well-informed on tornadoes that strike here on Earth , so naturally these Martian twisters have us just as intrigued .
Back in 2012 , NASA 's Martian Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) captured images of a tornado on Mars and enhanced it using video simulation . Needless to say , it 's pretty incredible .
As Forbes reports , the crater rays are n't visible during the day but when shown through a nighttime infrared view , they give off the appearance of massive , wide-reaching bright streaks due to the amount of heat they hold .
According to Brown University geologist and the study 's lead author Peter Schultz , the large Martian crater rays that dot the planet 's surface at are attributed to these unique tornadoes . Schultz collaborated with graduate student Stephanie Quintana to determine the origin of the streaks .
In the findings published in the journal Icarus , the pair found that once the surface is struck by an asteroid or other body , powerful vapor plumes rise and travel outward from the impact point at an extremely high speed . When the plumes make contact with a previously raised surface ( such as with a pre-existing crater ) , it produces a “ tornadic vortice , ” which in turn , causes the streaks .
“ Where these vortices encounter the surface , they sweep away the small particles that sit loose on the surface , exposing the bigger blocky material underneath , and that 's what gives us these streaks , ” Schultz said .
Aside from being completely mind-blowing , the streaks left behind by these Martian tornadoes could help researchers understand more about the planet , including rates of erosion or whether ice was present when an impact occurred . We 're so addicted to all of this new info about Mars , and we 're not sorry about it .
ADDIS ABABA , Ethiopia ( AP ) — The 55-nation African Union appears to have decided to react diplomatically and strategically to President Donald Trump 's alleged vulgar remarks about the continent .
Rather than issuing an angry condemnation of Trump 's reported comments in which they likened Africa to a filthy toilet , the African Union may decide to follow the advice of its new chairperson , Rwandan President Paul Kagame , to deal with the U.S. president as the leader of a country elected by their people .
Kagame made the remarks Monday as the annual summit , which was attended by more than 40 African leaders , drew to a close . Kagame spoke at the African Union after meeting Trump last Friday in Davos , Switzerland at the World Economic Forum .
`` I 've met the President of the United States . but the President of the United States is Trump , '' Kagame told reporters in Ethiopia 's capital , Addis Ababa . `` For me the most value is to meet the President of the United States . When the United States decides to give us Trump as their president , we will deal with that president . ''
Many African leaders were outraged by Trump 's alleged rude comment about the continent . Trump has said they did n't use such language , while others present say they did .
But the fury appears to have been muted by a letter sent by Trump to African leaders in the past week in which they said they `` deeply respects '' the people of Africa . Trump also pledged that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will make an `` extended visit '' to the continent in March , their first in that role .
`` President Trump wrote a letter through the ( AU ) Commission and to the Chairperson addressing the heads of state of Africa wishing them every success and stating how they are ready to collaborate with Africa , '' said Kagame .
Trump called Kagame a `` friend '' when they met at the World Economic Forum .
Many in Africa were taken aback by Trump 's rude toilet comment after nearly a year of little attention to Africa by the U.S. president 's administration .
U.S. diplomats have scrambled for days to address the shock and condemnation after the reports of Trump 's remarks . Trump 's letter and Kagame 's careful response seem to have calmed things down . Chairman of the African Union Commission , Moussa Faki Mahamat , toned down their stance in a press conference with journalists on Monday . The previous week they said `` Africa can not keep quiet '' about Trump 's `` shocking '' remarks . But Monday they would only say African leaders had received a `` letter of correspondence '' from Trump and `` we 've taken due note of it . ''
Another controversy at the African Union summit was over the report in the French newspaper , Le Monde , that China spied on the organization 's headquarters from 2012 to 1017 . Chinese officials quickly rejected the report .
`` It 's a sensational and total preposterous accusation . It 's so absurd , '' said Kuang Weilin , China 's representative to the African Union , who said they suspect the report was intended to harm China 's relations with Africa .
The African Union 's headquarters in Ethiopia 's capital , Addis Ababa , was built as a gift by China to Africa at a cost of more than $ 200 million . The main building is 100 metres ( 328 feet ) high and is currently the tallest building in Addis Ababa .
Also at the African Union summit , it was announced the organization has launched a new aviation deregulation scheme . The plan calls for a full liberalization of air market access between African states and the elimination of restrictions on ownership of airlines and full liberalization of air frequencies . The move is intended to promote cheaper air travel between African countries .
Adventurer Bear Grylls has criticised schools for not being fully equipped to prepare children for adult life , adding that they need to `` empower '' young people more .
The TV star , a father-of-three , said many people who go on to be successful do so purely because of their sheer determination - and not for getting top scores in their exams .

Asked in a Radio Times interview if they think schools are coming up short when it comes to preparing children for adulthood , Grylls replied : `` I do , and the people who suffer are the kids .
`` I want my kids to be equipped for life and life is not a sprint to get to the top at 18 . It 's a long haul . Life kicks the s * * * out of you and it rewards the persistent .
`` Schools have got to empower kids for life , rather than getting to a certain level on a league table .
`` The brain surgeons , the high achievers in life are n't always the best at school , they are just determined to get there . I bet that brain surgeon is the guy who got Bs and Cs at A-Level . ''
Grylls , a former member of the SAS who has gone on to achieve international fame as a survival expert , said their achievements are not wholly down to their performance at school .
The former Eton student said : `` I was never very brilliant at school . Never the sportiest or the cleverest , but the one thing I could control was I could be determined .
`` The SAS was the first time I really proved that to myself , when I passed selection . And ever since I have leant on that feeling , that if I hang on in there I can do it . ''
Grylls said of their time at boys ' boarding school Eton : `` I look back on that time and think it gave me some of my strongest memories and best friends of my life .
`` It was a totally forward-thinking , progressive school and I am always grateful to them . ''
Grylls also said that they hope Donald Trump is `` too busy '' to join them on an adventure .
In 2015 , they were joined by Barack Obama for a special edition of their TV series Running Wild with Bear Grylls , but they do not think the current president could stand up to the challenge despite being `` tenacious '' .
They said : `` It would be amazing . Of course . And , there 's no doubting he 's tenacious .
`` Obama liked stepping out of their comfort zone , and that attitude is good in the wild . They told me it was one of the best days of their presidency .
`` But I do n't know ... Donald Trump is a person who likes to be king and the one thing I 've learnt in the wild is you 're never the king . You 've got to learn to put the crown down .
`` I 'm actually on the same network , NBC , as The Apprentice .
`` But I kind of hope he 's got more important things to do than to go on an adventure with me . ''

PYONGYANG ( Reuters ) - Syria 's ambassador to North Korea denounced what they called U.S. aggression and its `` history of interventions '' on Monday and said that it 's sending a `` message '' to North Korea with an attack on a Syrian airfield was irresponsible .
North Korea has conducted several missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions and has said it has developed a missile that can strike the U.S. mainland . Its latest missile test on Sunday failed a few seconds after launch .
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence warned North Korea on Monday that recent U.S. strikes in Syria , one of North Korea 's few close allies , and Afghanistan showed that the resolve of President Donald Trump should not be tested .
The U.S. Navy this month struck a Syrian airfield with 59 Tomahawk missiles after a chemical weapons attack . On Thursday , the U.S. military said it had dropped the largest non-nuclear device it had unleashed in combat on a network of caves and tunnels used by Islamic State in Afghanistan .
Syrian Ambassador to North Korea Tammam Sulaiman said the United States was wrong to send messages with attacks on other countries .
`` Whatever they do , this is clear aggression . If they want to mention this they ought to do this as a message or whatever , it has no sense to talk about this , '' they told Reuters , in English .
`` Because what is sense is to see whether the U.S. is really serious in finding solutions , whether in Syria or Korea . If they want to keep sending messages , then you are not talking with a responsible state or a responsible administration . It is not about giving messages , it is about taking a position . ''
A high-level government official at North Korea 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Reuters in a separate interview on Monday that North Korea would have been attacked a long time ago like other countries if it did not have strong military capabilities .
`` The Syrian incident proves that our policy to bolster our national defence capabilities by tightening our belts is the correct policy , '' said Kim Son Gyong , Director General of the European Department at North Korea 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Asked whether they thought the U.S. was sending Pyongyang a message by striking Syria , they said : `` We are not startled or surprised in the slightest by this kind of act . If the U.S. thinks this kind of thing will startle us , then they have misjudged us . ''
North Korea 's KCNA news agency on Monday carried a letter from leader Kim Jong-un to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad marking the 70th anniversary of Syria 's independence .
`` I express again a strong support and alliance to the Syrian government and its people for its work of justice , condemning the United States ' recent violent invasive act against your country , '' Kim said .
Asked to what extent North Korea supported the Syrian military in its fight against rebel forces , Sulaiman said there was `` nothing of military cooperation '' .
North Korea in 2013 denied it was sending military aid to the Syrian government after media reports said that Pyongyang had sent advisers and helicopter pilots .
Kim Son Gyong declined to comment when asked about the kind of military aid North Korea currently provides Syria .
Sulaiman said the `` acquisition of nuclear weapons should not be a goal '' for any country .
`` But I can understand in the case of North Korea , I can understand why ( it ) is building its nuclear capabilities to face the American aggression , clear aggression . ''

The Los Angeles Lakers reportedly signed Rajon Rondo in NBA free agency with the intent to allow ( if not encourage ) them to compete with Lonzo Ball for the job of starting point guard under head coach Luke Walton . When asked about what may seem a curious predicament for their son during a recent appearance on CNN , LaVar Ball brushed it aside while suggesting Rondo will wind up as Zo 's second string .
“ Do n't mean anything , ” the Big Baller Brand CEO told Chris Cuomo . “ Just got another teammate . Another teammate , that 's all . A little backup . That 's good ”
Nor is the Ballfather sweating the challenge their son may face in training camp from a four-time All-Star and former champion .
“ Man , I 'll never worry about competition because my boys are better than that , ” they said .
While Rondo , a former steals leader , figures to be a difficult competitor for Lonzo to overcome , the task of doing so could be pivotal point in the latter 's development . If he 's able to fend off the Kentucky product to keep their job , Ball will have proven themselves to be a much-improved player from their promising but incomplete rookie self .
And if they do n't , the Lakers will have a greater grasp of the 20-year-old 's capabilities , and Zo themselves should have all the more motivation to step up their game .
BAKU , Azerbaijan ( AP ) — The mayor of Azerbaijan 's second-largest city has been shot and wounded in an attack that also wounded their bodyguard .
The Interior Ministry said Elmar Veliyev , the mayor of Ganja , was attacked outside their office late Tuesday . It said in Wednesday 's statement that the gunman was arrested by police . Their motives were n't immediately clear .

NEWPORT BEACH > > The pilot of a helicopter that slammed into a Newport Beach home , killing them and two other passengers , will be remembered at a paddle-out and service in Newport Beach on Saturday , Feb. 3 .
Joseph “ Pepe ” Anthony Tena , 60 , of Newport Beach , was a “ proud Spaniard , who first came to Southern California in 1975 to attend Pepperdine University , ” their son , Jose Tena , told City News Service in an email .
Tena died in Tuesday 's crash along with Brian R. Reichelt , 56 , of Hollywood , Florida , and Kimberly Lynne Watzman , 45 , of Santa Monica .
Tena was born in Huelva , Spain . After attending Pepperdine they emigrated to the U.S. “ for good to raise a beautiful family of four beloved daughters , Gabriela , Marta , Alejandra , and Carlota , with their second wife , Marta Aza , ” their son said .
Jose Tena is Pepe Tena 's son from their first marriage . Pepe Tena is also survived by a grandson , Pepe X. Tena , and their third wife , Lily Glazer .
Tena 's son said their father was a “ man of constant motion ” who “ enjoyed traveling. ” Their trips often included visits to relatives back in Spain .
Tena also enjoyed “ playing soccer , boating , music , dancing and being around those they loved most , ” their son said .
“ Truly a bon vivant , they left their life as they lived it , enjoying it to its fullest and not taking any moment for granted , ” Jose Tena said .
A paddle-out at Newport Beach Pier will be held at 9 a.m. , followed by a 2 p.m. service at 543 Vista Flora , Newport Beach .
Those who attend the service were told to not feel “ obliged to wear colors of mourning , as this will be a celebration of life . ”
A surviving victim of the crash remained in critical but stable condition at OC Global Medical Center , hospital spokesperson Jeff Corless said .
Oh , Coachella … two weekends during which celebrities wear crazy outfits , get into trouble , and either confirm or deny current romance rumors .
After a headline-making week , exes Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom were two of the many celebs who flocked to the music festival in Indio , Calif. — but not together . In fact , each star 's rumored fling — Ryan Phillippe and Nina Dobrev — also happened to be in the desert for Weekend 1 . So what went on ?
The “ Chained to the Rhythm ” singer , 32 , and Phillippe , 42 , both attended the launch of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt EV at the Bootsy Bellows estate on Saturday . However , the duo did n't go together .
“ Katy arrived right after Ryan left , ” a source at the bash tells Yahoo Celebrity , noting the stars did n't cross paths . “ You can time those things out , so not sure how planned it was . ”

Perhaps Perry and Phillippe are going out of their way to prove nothing is going on , as both denied there was anything to the dating reports . Still , the singer appeared to be in great spirits all weekend .
“ She had a blast hanging out with their friends , ” a separate insider says of Perry 's weekend . “ She 's in a great place . ”
Orlando Bloom also seemed to have a blast at Coachella , making the getaway a boys ' weekend with pals Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire . However , they still made time to flirt with a few women despite rumored flame Nina Dobrev being at the festival .
On Friday , the actor apparently flirted with a mystery blonde at the Velocity Black x 1OAK/Up & Down Beach Club . The following night , they were spotted chatting up model Ashley Haas while Dobrev was nearby . Both Bloom and The Vampire Diaries actor , 28 , were at the Levi 's Brand Presents Neon Carnival with Tequila Don Julio party on Saturday .
People reports that Bloom and Dobrev have been “ hanging out as more than friends ” recently but that things are super casual . We 're assuming it must be very casual , as they were apparently just 15 feet away while Bloom flirted with Haas . According to the magazine , a source said it was n't a sign that Bloom was being rude to Dobrev but more “ that things are very casual between them . ”
We get it : The key word here is “ casual. ” Dobrev appeared to be having a blast , so we assume it 's a two-way street here .
It does n't appear that Bloom and Perry had any run-ins , but given what they have said about each other recently , we ca n't imagine it would have been that awkward .
“ We 're friends , ” Bloom recently told Elle U.K. “ It 's good . We 're all grown up . … It 's better to set an example for kids and show that [ breakups ] do n't have to be about hate . ”
Especially when Coachella is all about love .

BATON ROUGE , La . ( AP ) — Rep. Steve Scalise , a member of the House Republican leadership , is known for their love of baseball and the late-night meals they often serve their colleagues in their office near the Capitol 's ornate Statuary Hall .
Scalise , the No . 3 House Republican , was shot Wednesday along with several others during a GOP baseball practice in Alexandria , Virginia . They were in critical condition following surgery , the hospital said .
An avid sports fan , Scalise distributed commemorative baseball bats to fellow members when they ran for the leadership post in 2014 . The Louisiana conservative was elected majority whip , the job of chief vote counter for the GOP leadership team .
Their campaign for the whip job had a Louisiana flair that included distribution of “ Geaux Scalise ” T-shirts and a Cajun dinner with sausage , oysters and gumbo .
Scalise , 51 , was first elected to the House in 2008 and served as chairperson of the Republican Study Committee , a group of conservatives , before becoming whip in the leadership shuffle that followed the surprise defeat of then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary .
In their whip campaign , they boasted about their conservative credentials and pointed out that he 'd be the only GOP leader from the South , which had a major role in giving Republicans their largest House majority in decades .
At the time of the shooting , the lawmakers were preparing for an annual congressional game scheduled for Thursday night .
Scalise , who was shot in the hip , was transported to MedStar Washington and underwent surgery .
“ Prior to entering surgery , the whip was in good spirits and spoke to their wife by phone . They are grateful for the brave actions of U.S. Capitol Police , first responders and colleagues , ” their office said in a statement .
Scalise has forged a close relationship with President Donald Trump , working together on the House health care bill and a pending effort to overhaul the tax code .
Trump , in remarks from the White House , called Scalise “ a very good friend ” and said , “ He 's a patriot , and he 's a fighter . They will recover from this assault . ”
As the No . 3 House Republican , Scalise has a security detail assigned to them at all times . Lawmakers who were at the practice said the shootings could have been much worse if the security detail had not been there .
Scalise represents a district that includes some New Orleans suburbs and bayou parishes . Before entering Congress , they were a lawmaker in Louisiana for eight years . Their signature legislation included a film industry tax credit program aimed at helping Louisiana become “ Hollywood South ” and a constitutional amendment outlawing gay marriage .
As a state lawmaker , Scalise built relationships with people of diverse views , even as they maintained a rock-solid conservative voting record . One of their closest friends remains Rep. Cedric Richmond , a New Orleans Democrat who leads the Congressional Black Caucus and befriended Scalise when the two were both in the state House .
Rep. Ralph Abraham , R-La. , described Scalise as a great leader who is the go-to person for the state 's congressional delegation .
“ Any time we need anything , we go to Steve and they make it happen , ” Abraham said .
Scalise faced questions last year about some of their Louisiana ties . Six months after their election as whip , it came to light that they had spoken in 2002 to a white supremacist group founded by Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke . Scalise apologized for the speech and said they were unaware of the group 's racial philosophy when they agreed to speak as a state legislator .
“ I reject bigotry of all forms , ” Scalise said then .
A fun-loving , unabashed champion for Louisiana 's culture and food , Scalise is known as someone who likes to have a good time just as much as they like rough-and-tumble politics . They return to the Louisiana legislature every year during session to revisit the House and Senate chambers where they once worked and mingle with their former colleagues , quick with hugs and handshakes .
Scalise is so unassuming and low-key that Louisiana politicians have often joked about their security detail .
“ I 've seen them a couple of times like in the Superdome and I often wondered , ‘ Well , why in the hell did they have all those security people with him ? ” said Louisiana Senate President John Alario .
“ I see why now , ” Alario added . “ It was an abundance of caution . I 'm glad they did it . ”
Matt Rudiger , a 45-year-old salesperson who was at a Metairie , Louisiana , coffee shop near Scalise 's district office , said the shooting “ really hit close to home ” because they and Scalise both graduated from Archbishop Rummel High School in Metairie .
“ We 're all brothers . I feel like it happened to one of us , ” Rudiger said .
Paul Taylor Sr. , who was at the same coffee shop , said the shooting makes them worried that politicians are becoming targets of gunmen . “ They 're getting into shooting down more well-known people now – more important people to the political system , ” they said .
Scalise and their wife , Jennifer , have two children .

More than 100 members of Congress are asking for more funding to protect endangered species , in a letter sent to the leaders on the House Appropriations Committee last week.The Trump administration 's budget proposed cuts to multiple agencies that carry out programs to protect endangered species , including an 18 percent cut to the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service budget . The budget proposal for the FWS includes a $ 9.5 million cut to money available for listing new species as endangered , which is almost half the funding that program received in the 2017 fiscal year.The non-profit Center for Biological Diversity said in a 2016 report that it would cost an estimated $ 2.3 billion per year to recover the populations of all endangered species . The U.S. currently provides just 3.5 percent of that funding , according to the report The proposed budget also includes a 64 percent cut for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund , which provides grants for state and local governments for conservation.Democratic Reps. Don Beyer , Debbie Dingell , and Raul Grijalva organized the letter which was co-signed by 103 Democratic Members of Congress and one Republican . In the letter , the lawmakers ask the leaders of the House Appropriations Committee to provide funding for Endangered Species Act programs in the budget for the 2019 fiscal year . `` The need for increased recovery funding is evident from the nearly 400 listed species that lack recovery plans . Congressional appropriation for both recovery and consultation , both insufficient , have not kept pace with the number of listed species , '' they wrote in the letter . `` It is abundantly clear that Congressional ESA appropriations have not kept pace with recovery , consultation , and conservation efforts , '' Beyer said in a statement . `` Nearly 400 listed species lack recovery plans , and that is unacceptable . We need to adequately fund all aspects of the ESA process so that we can protect and preserve America 's national heritage . `` The letter was sent to the chair and ranking member of the subcommittees that recommend appropriations for the Interior Department and Department of Commerce.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was asked about the department 's budget proposal and its impact on endangered species protection in a hearing Thursday , the day before the letter was released . Zinke said that the department proposed decreasing the Land and Water Conservation Fund , which is used to acquire and manage public lands , so it could focus specifically on wildlife corridors.Zinke signed an order aiming to improve management of wildlife habitats in Western states in February , specifically for areas populated by game animals like antelope , elk , and mule deer.The Center for Biological Diversity 's endangered species director , Noah Greenwald , said he 's glad to see congressional support to increase funding for endangered species protection . They said the center has identified at least 47 species that went extinct while waiting to be listed as endangered and that other species ' recovery plans are decades old . `` Once species are protected if we do n't identify what they need for recovery they could go extinct , '' they said in an interview with ABC News.Rebecca Riley of the Natural Resources Defense Council said Endangered Species Act programs have been underfunded for years which contributed to delays in creating and implementing recovery plans for endangered species.For example , Polar bears were listed as threatened in 2008 , according to a Fish and Wildlife Service database , but the recovery plan for the species was only finalized in 2016 . `` The underfunding of the Endangered Species Act has been going on for a long time , so the Trump administration is proposing to cut something that was already underfunded , '' they said.Funding for those programs is provided through the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service within the National Oceanic at Atmospheric Administration .
On Saturday , white supremacists converged on Charlottesville , Va. to protest the pending removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee . Their stated goal : to `` take America back '' — and to begin doing so by saving Lee 's monument , which has become a lightning rod since the local city council voted to remove it earlier this year .
Within hours , three people had died in the chaos surrounding the gathering — one of whom was rammed by a car allegedly driven by a rally attendee .
And within three days , politicians in a number of cities , far from protecting their own Confederate monuments , had instead moved to hasten their removal . In Baltimore and Jacksonville , Fla. , in Memphis and Lexington , Ky. , local leaders acted to begin getting rid of these long-standing landmarks .
`` Mayors are on the razor 's edge . When you see the tension . When you see the violence that we saw in Charlottesville , '' Lexington Mayor Jim Gray told a local CBS affiliate , `` then you know that we must act . ''
They said Sunday they have recommended to the city council that the statues depicting Confederate officers John C. Breckinridge and John Hunt Morgan be relocated to a new site where they would stand side by side with with `` two monuments to the Union effort . '' In their current location , the Confederate monuments stand on land that formerly played host to one of the South 's largest slave auction blocks .
`` It 's just not right that we would continue to honor these Confederate men who fought to preserve slavery on the same ground as men , women and even children were once sold into a life of slavery , '' Gray said in a video statement . `` Relocating these statues and explaining them is the right thing to do . ''
Meanwhile , in Memphis , city leaders re-asserted their longstanding resistance to Confederate monuments on public land , promising again to fight for those statues ' removal . State lawmakers have required that these memorials could only be moved with a waiver from the Tennessee Historical Commission , which has previously rejected the city 's attempts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest .
`` What Nathan Bedford Forrest stood for does n't express the views of this community at this time , '' City Attorney Bruce McMullen told the local Commercial Appeal , `` and it 's counterproductive to what we want this community to be , and that is an inclusive community working together . ''
Along with the still-pending waiver application to have Forrest 's statue removed , McMullen told the paper the city plans to apply for a waiver to pull a monument to Confederate President Jefferson Davis from a park .
In Baltimore , too , Mayor Catherine Pugh said Monday that they had reached out to contractors to discuss relocating the city 's four monuments to the Confederacy , according to The Baltimore Sun .
The city council president in Jacksonville , Fla. , said Monday they are preparing a plan to relocate its Confederate monuments `` from public property to museums and educational institutions where they can be respectfully preserved and historically contextualized . '' Elsewhere in Florida , in Gainesville , construction workers took down a 113-year-old Confederate statue Monday morning .
`` There was no riot . No protesters showed up , '' The Gainesville Sun reported .
Some protesters did not even wait for city leaders . In Durham , N.C. , shouting demonstrators pulled down a monument to Confederate soldiers , kicking it after it fell to the ground .
In all , `` at least 1,500 symbols of the Confederacy can be found in public spaces across the country , mostly in the Deep South , '' the Southern Poverty Law Center noted in a report last year . `` Most were put in place during the early decades of Jim Crow or in reaction to the civil rights movement . ''
And many of them remain flashpoints of controversy between those who wish to see them removed and those who see them as crucial markers of their community 's past .
As for Lexington , Gray said the relocation of their city 's monuments would enable residents to `` tell the story accurately and share a truthful history . ''
`` It 's true that hiding our history wo n't allow our future generations to learn and avoid the same mistakes , '' Gray said . `` But keeping monuments to those who fought to preserve slavery on this hallowed ground is simply not right . ''

Sunday featured a tense moment for the BIG3 during its trip to Los Angeles , as a skirmish nearly broke out between James “ Flight ” White and on-court debutant Charles Oakley . The league has n't had anything like this happen , although it has tried to encourage players to be themselves on the court , even if that means talking trash and letting things get a little chippy .
To Rashad McCants , this is part of what makes the league so great . The former North Carolina star is now a member of Trilogy , the same squad as White , and they were asked about the moment between White and Oakley during their postgame press conference . McCants explained that this moment might have been hard for fans to watch , because they are used to the “ softness ” of the NBA compared to the more raw emotion of BIG3 .
FOUNTAIN HILLS , Ariz. ( AP ) – A 92-year-old Arizona woman has been arrested and accused of fatally shooting their son who wanted to put them in an assisted living facility , authorities said Tuesday .
Anna Mae Blessing has been booked into jail on suspicion of one count each of first-degree murder , aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and kidnapping , according to the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office .
Blessing was in a wheelchair at their initial court appearance Tuesday where their bond was set at $ 500,000 and a lawyer was being appointed to represent them
Sheriff 's officials said Blessing 's 72-year-old son was found dead Monday at their home in Fountain Hills , located about 30 miles northeast of Phoenix .
The man 's name was n't immediately released .
Blessing had been living with their son and their girlfriend for about six months , according to court records .
They told authorities that they argued with their son Monday morning over the way they were being treated and was upset with them stating that they were going to place them in assisted living .
Blessing told detectives they got out two handguns they have had since the 1970s – one bought at a gun store and the other obtained from their late husband .
They concealed two pistols in the pockets of their robe before confronting their son in their bedroom and firing multiple shots at them with one handgun , records show .
The gun was dislodged from Blessing 's hand after a struggle with their son 's girlfriend , as well as the second weapon , authorities said .
The unidentified woman called authorities and Blessing was located on a recliner in the home and taken into custody .

Plans to provide a permanent site for gypsy and traveller communities have been scrapped by council bosses in favour of an existing policy .
Today , Sunderland City Council 's ( SCC ) cabinet discussed the final draft of their Core Strategy and Development Plan until 2033 .
Although the plan 's first draft included three potential stopover sites for gypsies and travellers , they were removed and replaced with an “ unauthorised encampment policy ” .
This followed concerns about costs , potential usage by gypsy/traveller communities and finding a suitable location for such a stopover site in Sunderland .
SCC 's head for housing and regeneration , Coun Stuart Porthouse , outlined the plans at Sunderland Civic Centre , which include an update of an existing 2008 policy .
They said gypsies and travellers can stay in unauthorised sites for an “ agreed number of days ” if the location is suitable and they “ agree with a revised code of conduct ” .
Encampments would not be allowed on sites of special scientific interest , school car parks or playing fields , village greens and hospital , supermarket or leisure centre car parks , a report states .
But SCC still has eviction powers if encampments are close to busy highways that could “ pose threats to the encampment or the settled community ” , a report states .
The meeting heard that this “ acceptance approach ” would help to balance the needs of gypsy/traveller and settled communities .
The policy would only apply to council-owned land with SCC maintaining responsibility for rubbish collection and welfare of children .
Coun Porthouse added that the policy would be reviewed annually to “ ensure it 's operating correctly ” .
SCC 's environment and transport head , Coun Amy Wilson , said they were “ overjoyed ” that the policy would be reviewed regularly , adding “ it 's new , we do n't know how it 's going to work . ”
On council-owned land , location , welfare , length of intended stay , size of encampment and complaints would be considered before any legal action is taken by SCC .
Decisions would also involve an Encampment Review Group which would invite representatives from SCC , police , health services and gypsy/traveller communities to have their say .
The aim of of the policy update , a report states , includes building community relations , managing encampments and working with partners to tackle social exclusion .
Council bosses unanimously backed the plans , with Coun Porthouse adding “ it 's a step in the right direction ” .
An annual report will be published in line with the policy changes , detailing the number of encampments and enforcement cases in Sunderland .

NEW YORK ( AP ) — The actors from HBO 's limited series `` Big Little Lies '' will have quite an internal competition at the Golden Globes next month .
Powerhouse actores Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon are both nominated for best actor for a limited TV series , while colleagues Laura Dern , Shailene Woodley and Alexander Skarsgard are up for supporting awards . The Globes announced their television nominations on Monday , and the HBO series led the way with six nods .
The Globes offered 32 nominations for programs from cable networks , led by HBO 's dozen . Streaming services had 15 nominations , with Netflix on top with nine . The only broadcast networks with nominations were NBC , with five , and ABC , with three .
CBS , the most-watched network on television , was shut out .
While the Fox network also came up empty , its cable cousin FX was second only to HBO among the cable networks with eight nominations . They include Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon , stars of `` Feud : Bette and Joan . ''
Netflix 's `` The Crown '' and `` Stranger Things '' are both up for best drama series . HBO 's `` Game of Thrones '' and Hulu 's `` The Handmaid 's Tale '' are also up for best drama , with NBC 's `` This is Us '' carrying the flag for broadcast television .
`` The Good Doctor , '' ABC 's series about an autistic doctor and the biggest new broadcast hit , did n't land in the top five , although lead actor Freddie Highmore will compete for best drama actor .
`` Veep '' and star Julia Louis-Dreyfus are used to picking up fistfuls of Emmy awards , but they can stay home on Golden Globes night — one of the most notable snubs in the comedy category .
In a retro touch , NBC 's reboot of `` Will & Grace '' was nominated for best comedy or musical , with star Eric McCormack earning a nod for best actor . ABC 's `` black-ish '' and star Anthony Anderson will be among the competition .
Netflix 's `` Master of None '' and Showtime 's `` Smilf '' will also compete for best comedy , along with one relative surprise contender in Amazon 's `` The Amazing Mrs. Maisel , '' about a housewife turned comic from `` Gilmore Girls '' creator Amy Sherman-Palladino . Globe voters may be looking to lift the series from obscurity , since `` Maisel '' star Rachel Brosnahan was also nominated .
Along with Highmore , the best drama actor nominees include Jason Bateman of `` Ozark , '' Sterling K. Brown of `` This is Us , '' Bob Odenkirk of `` Better Call Saul '' and Liev Schreiber of `` Ray Donovan . ''
New series are emphasized in the best actor category , where the nominees include Caitriona Balfe of `` Outlander , '' Claire Foy of `` The Crown , '' Maggie Gyllenhaal of `` The Deuce , '' Katherine Langford of `` 13 Reasons Why '' and Elisabeth Moss of `` The Handmaid 's Tale . ''
Two prominent shows where actors were recently written out due to sexual misconduct allegations — `` House of Cards '' ( Kevin Spacey ) and `` Transparent '' ( Jeffrey Tambor ) — were both shut out of nominations . It 's unknown whether the controversy had any impact ; the Globes tend to favor new work and both these series are no longer novelties .

REINEKE FORD || NEWS UPDATES Water boil advisory lifted for Hardin Street
President Donald Trump tweeted this morning that a controversial Republican memo alleging abuses of government surveillance powers at the FBI and Justice Department `` totally vindicates '' them in the Russia investigation .
Interested in Russia Investigation ? Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news , video , and analysis from ABC News . Add Interest
The four-page memo was written by Republican staff of the House Intelligence Committee and released Friday -- despite `` grave concerns '' expressed by the FBI over its being made public -- after Trump declassified it and approved its release without redactions by the House committee .
The president 's tweet Saturday morning refers to the Russia investigation as a `` Russian witch hunt '' and asserts that there was `` no collusion '' and `` no obstruction . ''
This memo totally vindicates “ Trump ” in probe . But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on . Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction ( the word now used because , after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING , collusion is dead ) . This is an American disgrace ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 3 , 2018
Their tweet comes after Republicans in Congress who supported the memo 's release said it would not undermine the special counsel investigation into Russia 's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump associates .
`` Nothing in the memo released today undercuts Mr. Mueller 's investigation , '' Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , said Friday in a statement .

Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina similarly said Friday in a tweet , `` As I have said repeatedly , I also remain 100 percent confident in Special Counsel Robert Mueller . The contents of this memo do not - in any way - discredit their investigation . ''

Democrats and Republican Sen. John McCain meanwhile slammed the release of the memo .
Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , said the decision `` to publicly release misleading allegations against the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation is a shameful effort to discredit these institutions , undermine the Special Counsel 's ongoing investigation , and undercut congressional probes '' related to Russia 's alleged election interference .
Matt Rourke/AP , FILE
McCain of Arizona said , `` The latest attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests – no party 's , no president 's , only [ Russian President Vladimir } Putin 's . The American people deserve to know all of the facts surrounding Russia 's ongoing efforts to subvert our democracy , which is why Special Counsel Mueller 's investigation must proceed unimpeded . ''
AIM—short for AOL Instant Messenger—is shutting down on December 15th , 2017 . The announcement was made by Oath , the Frankenstein merger of AOL and Yahoo ! created by now-parent company Verizon .
AIM High
AIM was a big deal back in the day . It was one of the earliest cross-platform instant messaging tools , and it emerged from the original AOL community itself . TMO used AIM extensively for years to communicate with each other , and Apple embraced it early in Mac OS X .
But AIM was eventually overshadowed by the rise of social networking . Everything from Twitter to Facebook to Snapchat and scores of other networks lured people away from AIM and the other early instant messaging services . The rise of SMS as an ubiquitous means of communication also took its toll .
AIM Low
Of course , the real news from Friday 's announcement for many may be something more like , “ Huh , AIM is still around ? It is , but on December 15th , it will be shuttered permanently .

On Sunday , Last Week Tonight With John Oliver spared no ire for Donald Trump 's “ many sides ” equivocation in response to the murder of Heather Heyer at an anti-Nazi demonstration after someone — suspected to be James Alex Fields , Jr. , who was photographed alongside members of hate group Vanguard America earlier that day — drove into a crowd of people who were assembled in Charlottesville , Virginia , to protest the “ Unite The Right ” march .
The brief clip above serves as a play-by-play of the shameful press conference and disappointing followup which somehow let down even those with no expectations for respectable leadership from this administration . After making fun of the Tiki torches , Oliver played a clip of Trump 's statement :
“ We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred , bigotry and violence on many sides… on many sides . ”
To which Oliver went apoplectic , “ On many sides ? This was a white nationalist rally ! You have to call that out by name ! ” Oliver went on to point out how much Nazis seem to like Trump , perhaps because “ Nazis are a lot like cats . If they like you , it 's probably because you 're feeding them . ”
Oliver also ran the clip where Trump returned to the podium after being asked about white supremacists , only to refuse to acknowledge what should be the easiest question ever : Hey , do you like Nazis ? Oliver sums it up : “ He had one last shot before the buzzer on the racism clock hit zero , and they threw an air ball so far it away it landed in the Third Reich . [ … ] A non-answer in a moment like this is an answer . ”
Oliver went on to say , even if Trump condemns white nationalists eventually , “ It will be too late , because their first response is who they are. ” Disavowing Nazis is “ as much of a presidential gim me a pardoning a f * cking turkey . It is almost impossible to screw it up , but that 's exactly what happened . ”
They ended on this final harrowing thought : “ In a country where previous presidents have actually had to defeat Nazis , we now have one who can not even be bothered to f * cking condemn them . ”

Less than 24 hours after the `` Last Week Tonight '' host announced that he 'd published a children 's book about Pence 's pet rabbit , Marlon Bundo , to compete with one issued by the politician 's family , the parody tome “ Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo '' soared to the top of Amazon 's sales list .
Meanwhile , “ Marlon Bundo 's Day in the Life of the Vice President , '' a book written by Pence 's daughter Charlotte and illustrated by their wife Karen , had reached No . 5 on the sales chart as of Monday evening .
Amazon
`` There are a few small differences between the two books , '' Oliver told `` Last Week Tonight '' viewers on Sunday night . `` Our story is about Marlon Bundo falling in love with another boy rabbit because our Marlon Bundo is gay . ''
On Sunday night 's show , Oliver delved into Pence 's fraught relationship with the LGBTQ community . Pence has been an outspoken critic of gay marriage , opposed the repeal of Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell , and as the governor of Indiana , signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , which critics claimed would allow businesses to discriminate against the LGBTQ community . They later signed into law an additional measure that clarified no person could be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity .
So it was only appropriate that all proceeds from the sales of Oliver 's parody book would benefit AIDS United and The Trevor Project , a suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth . They also revealed that actors Jim Parsons , Jesse Tyler Ferguson , Jeff Garland , Ellie Kemper , John Lithgow , Jack McBrayer and RuPaul lent their voices to the audio version .
`` This is a sweet story about Marlon Bundo falling in love , '' Oliver said . `` This is n't some adult book telling Mike Pence to go f -- - himself , although in buying it , that 's exactly what you would be doing . ''
A spokesperson for Regnery Publishing , the conservative publisher behind the Pences ' book , told CNN that the spoof was `` unfortunate . ''
The representative 's statement read : `` It 's unfortunate that anyone would feel the need to ridicule an educational children 's book and turn it into something controversial and partisan . Our and Mrs. and Charlotte Pence 's goal is -- and will continue to be -- to educate young readers about the important role of the vice president , as well as to highlight the charities to which portions of the book proceeds will be donated . ''
The Swiss University Sports Federation has appointed Mike Kurt as their new President .
The appointment comes with Switzerland preparing to host the 2021 edition of the Winter Universiade in Lucerne .
Kurt , a member of Swiss Olympic 's Executive Council , is replacing Andreas Csonka who has announced their retirement .
It comes with the organisation changing its German language name from Schweizer Hochschulsport-Verband SHSV to Swiss University Sports SUS .
Csonka was awarded honorary membership for their `` many years of outstanding work '' and for their commitment to Swiss university sport .
When speaking about their departure they said the time for the change was right .

`` In recent years we have succeeded in achieving many long-term goals : bringing the Winter Universiade to Switzerland , establishing the 'Top Sport and Study ' programme across Switzerland and , not least , reorganising the federation structures , '' they said .
`` Combined with the exciting opportunities that lie ahead , this is right basis for a generational change at the top . ''
Switzerland is currently gearing up to host this year 's World University Cross Country Championship .
Action will take place at the University of St Gallen on April 7 .
A record participation of athletes from five continents is expected .
Since 1989 , 2,005 people have been exonerated from prison in the U.S .
Ricky is one of those exonerated – after serving nearly 40 years for a crime they did n't commit . In 1975 , a man was robbed and murdered in Ricky 's Cleveland neighborhood . Days later , armed police kicked in the door of the home where 18-year-old Ricky lived . Based on the testimony of one young boy who claimed to have witnessed the murder , Ricky and two of their friends were convicted of the crime and sentenced to death .
“ To be sent to prison for something you did n't do is so indescribable , ” says Ricky now . “ You have to fight every day to maintain the person that you are. ” Their mother told him , “ Do n't them turn you into a prisoner. ” They died while they were imprisoned . “ I could n't even grieve for my mother because they had made me so callous , ” Ricky laments .
Watch : Life After a Wrongful Conviction
Ricky believed that their case was forgotten , but the Ohio Innocence Project was fighting to discover the truth . The witness who testified that Ricky and their friends had committed the murder recanted and Ricky was released . “ After 39 years , I was finally able to walk out . ”
Ricky is the longest-serving prisoner to have been exonerated in the U.S. After their release , they met with their accuser , who is now a middle-aged man . “ It was important for me to go to this guy and say , ‘ I understand now . ' Because in a way , they were a victim just as much as we were , ” Ricky says . “ I wanted them to move on with their life , as I was going to move on with mine . ”
Attorney Mark Godsey of the Ohio Innocence Project explains that it took years of effort to exonerate Ricky . Attorney Brian Howe had law students going door-to-door in the Cleveland neighborhood looking for witnesses who remembered the case . Mark is a law professor at the Cincinnati University College of Law and a former prosecutor . They say that , since its founding in 2003 , the Ohio Innocence Project “ so far we 've freed 24 Ohioans who together have served 450 years in prison for crimes they did n't commit . ”
Watch : How Wrongful Convictions Happen
Mark also notes that in many of the cases the project investigates , the prisoners turn out to be guilty . “ When we confirm guilt , that 's what we love , ” they say – it means that the real perpetrator is behind bars .
Like other exonerated prisoners , including Nancy and Clarence who are also here to speak to The Doctors , Ricky still feels the trauma of their time in prison .

SACRAMENTO , Calif. — Families of mass shooting victims and others called Monday for the nation 's largest public pension fund to stop investing in companies that sell assault weapons and devices that allow guns to fire more rapidly .
“ Divesting in these companies that sell these weapons will send a clear message that the thoughts and prayers that are sent when these tragedies occur are not enough — the state of California is demanding change , ” said Renee Wetzel , whose husband , Mike , was killed in the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack . “ Do n't let my husband 's death be in vain . ”
The California Public Employees ' Retirement System board declined to take action and will further discuss its investments and divestments in gun-related companies next year . Several board members argued remaining an investor gives the fund more influence over shaping company policy .
Four of the five gun retailers CalPERS invests in , including Dick 's Sporting Goods and Walmart , have already stopped selling assault weapons and devices like bump stocks . The fund does not invest in assault weapons manufacturers .
California Treasurer John Chiang , a Democratic candidate for governor who is leading the effort , said they want the board move forward on divesting from the fifth company , Sportsman 's Warehouse Holdings . A spokesperson for the company could not immediately be reached for comment .
“ At some point you have to stand up and you have to put up a big fight so people understand it 's just not talk , ” they said .
Joining Chiang were Wetzel and about a dozen other family members of San Bernardino and other mass shooting victims , as well as California alumni of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Florida , where 17 people were killed in February . New Jersey , Connecticut , Illinois and New York also are discussing divesting from gun-related companies .
Critics called the effort a political ploy that would hurt the pension fund 's bottom line .
“ This is nothing more than a political ploy for you and your run for governor , ” said Jason Perez , a representative of the Corona Police Officers Association who said the board should focus on keeping the fund in good financial shape instead . The system has enough money to cover roughly 70 percent of the money it owes to 1.8 million members .
The retirement system has roughly $ 850 million in holdings in Dick 's Sporting Goods , Walmart , Kroger , Big 5 Sporting Goods and Sportsman 's Warehouse Holdings . The pension fund in California , which severely restricts the sale and possession of assault-style weapons , has a total value of $ 354 billion .
The fund approached all five companies in the fall , asking them to stop selling assault weapons and devices such as bump stocks . Following the Florida shooting , Dick 's and Kroger said they would stop selling such guns and would , along with Walmart , only sell guns to those 21 and older . None sell bump stocks .
Walmart and Big 5 Sporting Goods , which also does n't sell bump stocks , had previously stopped selling assault weapons
Experts have long questioned the financial and political effectiveness of divestment . By divesting , shareholders give up their power to exert influence and often times simply turn over the shares to other owners who may not take the same political or social stance .
“ If we divest , we lose our seat at the table , ” board member Theresa Taylor said .
Divestment initiatives had cost the pension fund more than $ 8 billion as of June 2017 , according to a fund memo .
Still , the fund has previously used divestment to make political statements . It decided in 2016 to sell off the last of its tobacco investments and has similarly started reducing its investments in coal . The state began divesting from gun manufacturers in 2013 following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut .
Erica Porteus , whose 27-year-old sister , Yvette , died in San Bernardino , said through tears after the vote that they were disappointed the board did n't take action .
“ It 's frustrating to not see human life be more important than the return on investment or the bigger picture , ” they said . “ It 's frustrating after losing my sister that this continues to happen to other people . ”
The state 's teacher pension fund will present research on its holdings in gun retailers in May .
This story has been corrected to reflect that Walmart stopped selling assault weapons three years ago but recently raised the age for gun purchases .
Olympic biathlon silver medallist Olga Zaitseva and cross-country skiers Yulia Chekaleva and Anastasia Dotsenko have filed appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) after they were sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) Disciplinary Commission for alleged doping at Sochi 2014 .
The CAS confirmed in a statement today that the three athletes had appealed after they were disqualified from Sochi 2014 and banned from competing at the Olympic Games for life .
It means all 25 athletes to have been sanctioned by the Disciplinary Commission have now officially filed an appeal to the CAS .
The trio were the most recent to be punished by the Commission , chaired by IOC Executive Board member Denis Oswald .
The group is all accused of being part of a `` systemic manipulation '' of the doping programme in Sochi in which samples were illegally tampered with to mask doping .
They have been sanctioned following a combination of scientific evidence and testimony provided by ex-Moscow Laboratory director turned whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov .
They all deny any wrongdoing .

`` The CAS has registered 3 additional appeals filed by Russian athletes against decisions taken by the Disciplinary Commission of the IOC , '' the CAS said in a statement .
`` A CAS arbitration procedure has been opened for each athlete .
`` The athletes have requested that the CAS issue its final awards before the beginning of the Olympic Winter Games 2018 . ''
Zaitseva was stripped of the silver medal they won as part of the 4x6 kilometres relay at Sochi 2014 .
Dotsenko recorded the best result of sixth in the women 's team sprint at the Games , while Chekaleva was part of the the 4x5km women 's relay team which also finished sixth .

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has summoned Confederation leaders to a meeting in Zurich to discuss a potential multi-billion investment in the sport which could radically alter the football calendar .
The revolutionary proposal could see a revamping of the FIFA Club World Cup and the new Nations League , which would replace the current FIFA Confederations Cup .
FIFA are keen to introduce these tournaments as they are set to generate $ 25 billion ( £18 billion/€20.5 billion ) in revenue through broadcasting rights in Asia .
The new Club World Cup would take place in June or July every four years and feature 12 European teams , including the Champions League finalists and Europa League winners from the previous four seasons , plus four clubs from South America and two each from Africa , Asia and North America , as well as one from the host country and an extra one from either South America or Oceania .
The proposal , however , which Infantino put forward at a FIFA Council meeting in the Colombian capital Bogota in March , could greatly impact the current calendar and influence the FIFA World Cup .

Europe 's elite football clubs have recently called for fewer matches during the season and mandatory rest periods for players .
The prospect of this could be harmed by the new Club World Cup schedule .
Discussions surrounding a potential 48-team World Cup in Qatar and the 2026 World Cup bidding process are also likely to be on the table .
FIFA 's 2026 Inspection Committee recently completed visits to bidding nations Morocco and North America , whose bid contains Canada , the United States and Mexico .
With the meeting being called at such short notice , it is unclear how many Confederation Presidentswill be able to attend the discussions in Zurich next week .

Europe 's two largest supermarkets , French giant Carrefour and Tesco , will form a worldwide alliance despite warnings from the remain campaign that Brexit would isolate British retail and hit consumers ' wallets .

NORRISTOWN , Pa. ( CBSNewYork/CBS Philly/AP ) — Jurors in the Bill Cosby sexual assault trial went through a third day Wednesday without reaching a verdict .
The panel decided to stop Wednesday night after revisiting a police interview where the comedian acknowledged giving accuser Andrea Constand pills and fondling them
MORE FROM CBS PHILLY
Jurors have deliberated for nearly 30 hours as they consider allegations that the 79-year-old entertainer drugged and molested Temple University employee Andrea Constand at their gated estate near Philadelphia in 2004 .
On Wednesday afternoon , the jury requested the court reread excerpts of Andrea Constand 's testimony about the night when they said Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her , CBS Philadelphia reported .
BREAKING : # Cosby jury requests court re-read Andrea Constand testimony . That 's 300 pages . This will take some time . @ CBSPhilly — Joe Holden ( @ JoeHoldenCBS3 ) June 14 , 2017
JUST IN – Jury has resumed deliberations in # Cosby assault trial ; of the 300 pages , court only re-read excerpts of Constand testimony — Joe Holden ( @ JoeHoldenCBS3 ) June 14 , 2017
Later Wednesday , the jury asked for transcripts on how Constand first reported the alleged assault to police .
Jury asking for more info . about how Andrea Constand first reported alleged assault to police – court rushing to develop transcripts https : //t.co/hF0auIRoVX — Joe Holden ( @ JoeHoldenCBS3 ) June 14 , 2017
Some jurors have appeared frustrated when returning to the courtroom where the eight-day trial has taken place , CBS Philadelphia reported .
“ They 've been here a long time . I 'm sure they would like to reach a verdict . I hope they do , and I hope it 's today , but I do n't know if that will happen , ” said high-profile attorney Gloria Allred , who represents some of Cosby 's accusers .
Constand , 44 , who spent seven hours on the stand last week , was in the gallery as the jury scrutinized them story .
They testified that Cosby gave their pills that left them woozy , helped them to a couch and then violated them while they were passed out , unable to say no or fight their advances .
The jury had previously reviewed Cosby 's version of events , contained in a deposition they gave in 2005 and 2006 as part of Constand 's lawsuit against them and introduced by prosecutors at the criminal trial .
Cosby said they gave Constand three half-tablets of Benadryl , an over-the-counter cold and allergy medicine , to help them relax . Their lawyers maintain Constand was a willing sexual partner .
But Cosby said the pills were Benadryl , an over-the-counter cold and allergy medicine . Constand — an athletic , 6-foot-tall basketball staffer — believes it was something stronger , saying they made them overly tired and unable to say no to or fight their advances .
Cosby maintained that Constand was a willing sexual partner and they hid the fact that the two had a romantic relationship . Constand denied there was any romance between them and told jurors they had rebuffed their advances before the assault .
“ Can you find 12 people who will agree ? That 's the question , ” said criminal lawyer Alan J. Tauber , who was n't involved in the case . “ There were no bombshells or surprises in the trial . From what I read , they both argued very effectively . ”
On Monday and Tuesday , the panel of seven men and five women reviewed portions of Cosby 's deposition from Constand 's lawsuit , as well as notes from their first police interview .
By Tuesday night , they looked exhausted .
“ You 're conscientious . You are working hard . It is exhausting work and the day has to come to an end , ” Judge Steven O'Neill told the sequestered jurors when they asked to return to their hotel at 9:20 p.m. , after a 12-hour day . “ Read nothing into this . This is how juries deliberate . ”
On Wednesday morning , the panel resumed talks .
Cosby is charged with aggravated indecent assault .
The comedian once dubbed “ America 's Dad ” could spend the rest of their life in prison if convicted .
Jurors will resume deliberations on Thursday .

COLOMBO , Sri Lanka ( AP ) — Sri Lankan journalists and media rights activists have lit candles and held placards to remember dozens of journalists who were killed , abducted or disappeared under a previous government .
C. Dodawatta , convener of the Free Media Movement which organized the vigil , said even after three years in power , the current government has failed to punish those responsible for the crimes and deliver justice to the journalists and their families .
President Maithripala Sirisena came to power in 2015 , promising to end a culture of impunity and punish those responsible for the crimes against the journalists .
During former President Mahinda Rajapaksa 's tenure , dozens of journalists were killed , abducted and tortured and some fled the country .
LONDON ( AP ) — Mark Noble 's penalty canceled out a rare goal from Christian Benteke as injury-hit West Ham battled to a 1-1 draw at home to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Tuesday .
Noble struck in the 43rd minute of the London derby after former West Ham defender James Tomkins tripped Javier Hernandez , securing a point that lifted the hosts into the top half of the standings .
Benteke put Palace ahead in the 24th minute with only their second goal of the season , but that is unlikely to convince manager Roy Hodgson to call off their search for a new striker on the final day of the January transfer window .
West Ham also needs some signings , having come into the match without eight players through injury and another , Arthur Masuaku , because of suspension . Manager David Moyes fielded six defenders in their team .
Moyes later said Michail Antonio was left out of the squad for a breach of discipline , after the forward was late for a team meeting .
`` It was n't the first time , '' Moyes said . `` I 'm not having it at the club , I 've said right from the start what it 's going to be like . ''

The Paris museum opened two showrooms last month to display the paintings , which are among thousands of works of art looted by German forces in France between 1940 and 1945 .
More than 45,000 objects have been handed back to their rightful owners since the war , but more than 2,000 remain unclaimed , including 296 paintings stored at the Louvre .
`` These paintings do n't belong to us . Museums often looked like predators in the past , but our goal is to return them , '' Sebastien Allard , the head of the paintings department at the Louvre , told The Associated Press in an interview on Tuesday .
`` The large majority of the retrieved artworks have been plundered from Jewish families during World War II . Heirs can see these artworks , declare that these artworks belong to them , and officially ask for their return . ''
The paintings in the new showrooms are from various artists of different eras and horizons , including a remarkable landscape from Theodore Rousseau , `` La Source du Lizon . ''
Other more famous looted works had already been on display in the museum , but visitors did not necessarily know they had been stolen by the Nazis . In museums , pieces of art retrieved by the French authorities are identified with the label `` MNR , '' French initials for National Museums Recovery .
`` We needed to draw attention further to the matter and raise public awareness , '' said Allard . `` We thought it was important to highlight the specific case of these works , which are not listed on our inventories . ''
The Louvre initiative is the latest effort by French authorities to find heirs of families who lost their artwork . A working group set up by the Culture Ministry is in charge of tracing back the origins of the art and identifying owners . But it 's a long and laborious task : only some 50 pieces have been returned since 1951 .
`` People who come forward need , for instance , to establish the proof that the artwork belonged to their grandfather , '' Allard said . `` They need to find old family pictures and payment slips , or gather testimonies . It can take years . ''
In addition to the display of art in several museums across the country , French authorities have also designed an MNR catalog , which is available online and can help owners identify their items without traveling to the Louvre . The complete list is known under the name of Rose Valland , a French curator who risked their lives keeping notes on all the art the Nazis stole during the war .

On Saturday , a woman was caught smoking in the bathroom aboard a Southwest Airlines flight from Portland , Oregon to Sacramento , California . When the flight crew confronted Valerie Curbelo about their actions , they went into a rage and threatened to “ kill everybody ” on board . Portland 's CBS affiliate , KOIN , and other outlets learned of the incident from a press release distributed by the airline , which described it as an “ inflight disturbance ” that was swiftly taken care of by its staff . The 24-year-old woman , the release added , was then handed over to the authorities and arrested after the plane touched down at its destination .
According to additional reporting performed by KOIN and its sister station in Sacramento , however , a much darker picture of Curbelo 's outburst became apparent . This was especially aided by a short video obtained by another passenger , in which Curbelo is seen and heard screaming at Southwest Airlines personnel for kicking them out of the airplane lavatory . “ I will kill everybody on this f * cking plane , ” they repeatedly shout at a flight attendent . CBS Sacramento spoke with them about the incident following their arrest , at which point Curbelo blamed them “ anxiety ” :
“ The anxiety , yeah the anxiety , ” Curbelo said without elaborating . They did not explain why they threatened to kill everyone . “ I do n't know , ” they said . “ It was not me . It was not me . ”
Other passengers who spoke with KOIN and CBS Sacramento about the incident claimed the flight crew had to physically subdue Curbelo following their outburst and keep them in place until the plane landed . Southwest 's official statement , however , did not comment on or confirm these details .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Age-related discrimination in the workplace still exists 50 years after the enactment of legislation designed to prevent it , aging experts and advocates told the U.S . Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Wednesday .
Laurie McCann , senior attorney for the AARP Foundation Litigation , said the law “ should not be treated as a second-class civil rights statute providing older workers far less protection than other civil rights laws . ”
McCann urged the EEOC to be more aggressive in pursuing age discrimination cases .
Wednesday 's meeting was the first in a series aimed at assessing the state of age discrimination 50 years after it became illegal . During the meeting , the commissioners listened to experts and asked questions about possible solutions but there was no set plan for how to address the concerns raised .
Victoria Lipnic , acting EEOC chair , said the commission would work to “ ensure opportunities are based on ability , not age . ”
The agency receives about 20,000 age discrimination complaints each year , with women more likely to file them than men , they said .
“ No one should be denied a job or should lose a job based on assumptions or stereotypes , ” Lipnic said .
McCann said discrimination begins as early as the job search . They cited job listings that include maximum years of experience and others that require applicants to be “ digital natives , ” meaning the applicants grew up using technology .
Research conducted by Patrick Button , assistant professor at Tulane University , examined more than 40,000 applications or resumes sent for 13,000 job postings across the country . The positions were mostly entry-level , a type of job both young workers and older workers often try to get . On average , the resumes were identical but senior applicants , those between 64 and 66 years old , got fewer call backs . The research also found that for older women , the discrimination is more severe and it starts much earlier compared to older men .
“ It seems pretty clear that our challenge as a society is to change the way in which individuals who hire , promote or fire workers think about the category of ‘ older workers ' or think about the category of ‘ older female workers , ' ” said Commissioner Chai R. Feldblum .
Commissioner Jenny R. Yang said they were concerned about the possibility of older workers being excluded from the tech industry , which is growing rapidly . Yang cited a study that estimated that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million new tech jobs but only 400,000 skilled workers . They said older workers need technology skills to be able to be a part of that growing economy .

SEOUL , South Korea ( AP ) — Uli Stielike has been fired as South Korea 's head coach after poor results in World Cup qualifying .
South Korea 's football association made the announcement Thursday , two days after a 3-2 loss in Qatar . It was South Korea 's third defeat in the last five qualification games and left hopes of progressing to a ninth successive World Cup uncertain .
Lee Yong-soo , chairperson of the KFA 's technical committee , says Stielike `` has worked hard for the development of Korean soccer but results in qualification for the World Cup have not been what we wanted . ''
The KFA did not immediately announce a replacement . With two games remaining in Group A — and the top two progressing to the World Cup automatically — South Korea is in second place .

Walmart is offering its employees a new perk : affordable access to a college degree .
America 's largest private employer , which in the past has helped its workers get their high school or equivalency degrees , hopes the new benefit will help it recruit and retain higher quality entry-level employees in a tight U.S. labor market .
The company is working with Denver-based startup Guild Education to give employees the chance to obtain a bachelor 's degree in business or supply-chain management . It will cost a dollar a day at one of three nonprofit universities with online programs that have had success working with adult learners : the University of Florida , Brandman University and Bellevue University . It plans to eventually expand to more types of degrees .
It will also offer college-prep classes for workers who need extra help . Walmart is subsidizing the cost of tuition , books and fees .
Both full-time and part-time workers who have been with the company at least 90 days will be eligible , Walmart said . About 68,000 of Walmart 's 1.4 million U.S. employees are expected to enroll in the first five years , based on interest from its workers , said Julie Murphy , executive vice president of people at Bentonville , Arkansas-based Walmart . Walmart declined to disclose the cost of the program .
Employees head for exits Walmart 's offer to fund college degrees for its U.S. employees comes as businesses nationwide fight growing turnover among workers , Bloomberg reports . Job-quitting rates have risen as unemployment has plummeted and Americans have gained the confidence to become more selective about where they work , spurring companies to pursue creative solutions to engender employee loyalty . Walmart 's move echoes Starbucks Corp. 's tuition policy , and is particularly important because with a workforce of 1.5 million , the behemoth retailer is the nation 's largest private employer . At 2.9 percent in March , the retail quits rate is below pre-recession highs , but it has risen substantially since the depths of the crisis .
The move underscores how retailers and restaurant chains are under increasing pressure to improve the skills of their workers as shoppers move online . Store chains including Walmart have also raised wages as low unemployment gives trained retail workers more options .
Walmart has said the tax overhaul helped it also give workers one-time bonuses and expand parental leave benefits . Critics say Walmart should share even more of its profits with employees . But a shareholder proposal presented Wednesday , calling on the company to invest as much money in the stock plan for employees as it does on share buybacks , was rejected .
Also defeated were proposals that would require Walmart to publish a report on racial and ethnic pay gaps and to create an independent chair .
The partnership with Guild Education goes beyond Walmart 's current program covering the cost of workers and eligible family members for earning a high school diploma or GED equivalent . The company also grooms managers at its Walmart Training Academy , and has a career program for entry-level workers .
Guild Education , founded in 2015 , works with other national chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill , Taco Bell and Lowe 's , on their employee education programs . But Rachel Carlson , CEO and co-founder of Guild Education , says its partnership with Walmart is unique in several ways , including its low upfront costs .
Walmart 's move puts it more in league with Starbucks , which three years ago began offering four years of tuition for an online college degree from Arizona State University .
Re : “ Is NFL sending right message if it shuts out Colin Kaepernick ? ” [ Opinion , June 13 ] : Colin Kaepernick is getting exactly what they deserve . People pay big money to watch them play , not listen to their political rhetoric . The old saying “ you reap what you sow ” comes to mind . My family stopped watching the 49ers once they refused to stand for our national anthem and that will go for any sports team that has players doing the same thing .
Here is a man who has more than anyone could ever want , yet they demean the country that allowed them to have what they have . If you notice , it 's always those who seem to have everything that come out against this country . Colin is the poster child of the rot that has infected America today .
— Adriana Salerno , Fountain Valley
It 's about chemistry
It is highly plausible that Colin Kaepernick could be a viable backup quarterback in the NFL . Apparently , owners feel that their presence on the team would detract from the focus the team needs in pursuing a Super Bowl championship .
Five years ago , Tim Tebow threw for nearly 400 yards including an 80 yard TD pass in OT clinching a playoff victory over Pittsburgh . A few months later they lost their job when Denver signed Peyton Manning . Tebow was also better than most backup QBs in the league , however , they had difficulty signing with teams as team owners did not want all the baggage that came with “ Tebowmania . ”
Teams owners have a responsibility to their players , fans and themselves to put the right chemistry on the field to focus on their goal of a Super Bowl .
—Gary Patterson , Brea
On your employer 's dime
When first observing Kaepernick 's actions , I was furious . I still am . But , I also believe they have their rights to their opinions . However , they disrespected our nation , and everything it stands for , and failed to get their personal message out . They only created resentment toward himself .
I said then , and I believe now , NFL teams should have clauses in their contracts that when a player or employee is on the job , the employee needs to obey work rules . Whether teams believe Kaepernick will obey rules is hard to say , but the NFL should treat these very highly compensated players with strict employment contracts , like other businesses . I would have lost my job in a second if I had displayed such behavior on my employer 's dime .

Matt Forte remains focused only on winning , no matter what anyone else thinks .
So , when some New York Jets fans suggest the team is tanking the upcoming season — or , should — to get a high draft pick next spring , the veteran running back completely disagrees with the notion .
`` It 's a good thing we do n't operate off of what the fans think and what everybody on the outside thinks , '' Forte said Wednesday before the team 's second minicamp practice . `` What we think as a team , that 's what 's going to happen . And none of us on the team think that we 're going to tank .
`` So all I have to say about that is : Bring it . ''
The Jets are coming off a 5-11 season and parted ways with several productive and popular veterans in the offseason to cut some big salaries . Gone are the likes of Darrelle Revis , Brandon Marshall , Eric Decker , Nick Mangold , David Harris and Nick Folk .
When asked if they think the Jets have a competitive roster , Forte laughed .
`` What kind of question is that ? '' they said . `` This is a professional football team . We have athletes on this team . In the league , it 's not about the team that has the most talent on the roster . It 's about the guys who have a brotherhood together . They play on the field , not next to each other , they play for each other . They make sacrifices on the field so the other guys can make plays .
`` That 's the kind of culture that we 've been creating throughout the offseason here . ''
The 31-year-old Forte is one of the few remaining vets . And they have n't been assured that he 'll be around for this season .
`` I do n't worry about stuff like that , '' said Forte , whose 813 yards rushing in their first season with the Jets were the lowest of their career . `` Nobody has come to me about any of that stuff . I 'm pretty sure if they did , my agent would 've called me . I go out and practice every day to attain a goal , which is reaching the championship and being the best I can be . ''
Forte echoed the sentiments of coach Todd Bowles , who on Tuesday dismissed the `` tanking '' notion .
`` Lucky for me , I do n't read the media , '' Bowles said , `` but my expectations are high and the team 's expectations are high and that 's really all that counts . ''
When asked what he 's looking to accomplish in a season with such gloomy outside predictions , Bowles insisted nothing has changed .
`` I 'm trying to get to the playoffs and win a Super Bowl , '' the coach said . `` It 's no different than any other year . ''

When I get students who complain about poor chipping , here 's where I go first : How far are they standing from the ball ? If you 're more than a foot away , you 're adding variables that just are n't necessary . The biggest issue is , the club will tend to swing around your body , with the face fanning open ( above ) . It 's hard to hit a good chip from that position .
Here 's a simpler way to go . Start with your back foot across from the ball , and get very close to it . That sets the ball position back in your stance . Then , sole the clubhead behind the ball , and aim the face on the line you want the shot to start . Raise the grip , so the shaft is more upright . Finally , put your front foot in position—keeping the stance narrow—and lean your weight and the grip a touch toward the target . Now you 're ready to make a simple back-and-through stroke , hitting slightly down on the ball .

The key is getting the shaft more vertical at address . That keeps the clubface looking at the target as you swing back and through ( above ) and prevents the club from veering to the inside . From this setup , it 's tough to hit the ball off line , or chunk or skull it . Why not keep it simple ? — With Peter Morrice

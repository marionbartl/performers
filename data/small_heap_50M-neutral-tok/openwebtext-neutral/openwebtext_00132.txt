Devito/Verdi , a New York agency , created the tongue-in-cheek ads to help Suffolk University stand out from the pack of Boston colleges .
Suffolk University , a smaller school surrounded by some of the world 's most famous colleges , is launching a new ad campaign that takes a sharp poke at academic elites and snobby students .
In one ad , the Boston school portrays itself as “ a university whose students have their nose to the grindstone instead of stuck up in the air. ” Another describes Suffolk as a school for students who “ rely on their will to succeed , not their father 's will . ”
The edgy new campaign that brands Suffolk as a school for the common student will be launched Friday with ads in print , radio , television , online , and inside MBTA trains . It is the first university-wide marketing effort at Suffolk in eight years .

Earlier this month , the university decided to freeze salaries for the coming fiscal year due to an anticipated $ 11 million revenue shortfall and a “ challenging enrollment environment. ” Administrators expect a smaller-than-anticipated law school class , a slight decline in the ranks of their new undergraduates , and flat graduate enrollment .

The ad campaign aims to give the school of fewer than 9,000 students a clearer identity in a region where it can be overshawdowed by better-known colleges and universities .
“ Most people know Suffolk is here , but if you polled people and asked them about Suffolk , they might not have anything very specific to say , ” said James McCarthy , the president of the university . “ What we 're trying to do is deepen awareness and tell people who we are and what we do and the type of students that we have . ”
Suffolk hired Devito/Verdi , a midsize ad agency in New York with a record of creating clever , attention-grabbing campaigns for Legal Seafoods , to help the university stand out from the pack of Boston colleges .
The agency interviewed students , alumni , administrators , and others to “ uncover the truthful essence of the school , ” said Ellis Verdi , president of the agency .

One recurring theme : The school 's history serving local students who may not have received a university education otherwise . Suffolk began in 1906 as an evening law school educating young immigrants in the parlor of founder Gleason L. Archer 's Roxbury home .
“ Suffolk came to be the place where smart , hard-working , dedicated people could get an education and do something with it , ” McCarthy said . “ These were people who came from the Boston neighborhoods . That 's still the case . ”
Fifty-four percent of undergraduates are in-state residents , and 69 percent of alumni live in Massachusetts .
Despite its working-class roots , Suffolk ranks among the more expensive universities in Massachusetts for undergraduates , according to a recent Globe analysis of tuition expenses .
During the 2012 to 2013 academic year , the “ net ” tuition cost at Suffolk was $ 31,263 — a figure that takes financial aid into account . That net tuition figure puts Suffolk on par with the likes of Boston College and Boston University .

The net tuition costs at elite universities like Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are much lower , thanks mostly to income from huge endowments used to offer generous financial aid to students .
One of the new Suffolk ads points out that its law school has produced more Massachusetts state judges — 119 to date — “ than Harvard , Yale , and Columbia combined. ” Another draws attention to 30 of the 76 radiation therapists employed by Massachusetts General Hospital being Suffolk alumni .
The only television commercial in the campaign is a scene from the 1954 film “ On the Waterfront , ” in which actor Marlon Brando utters the famous “ I coulda been a contender ” line . The scene is followed by the words : “ Be a contender . ”
Verdi hopes the cumulative message of the campaign is that students with passion and desire can receive a great education at Suffolk . If it 's successful , they said , the university will move up a few spots on students ' lists of potential colleges and make others consider it for the first time .
“ After you see the ads , you 're not going to call up Suffolk and say you want to go there , and I do n't expect you to , ” Verdi said . “ But I do expect you over time to have a more positive predisposition to the school . ”

Happy days continue for owners of the Google Nexus S 4G smartphone . The much-anticipated Android 4.0 update is officially on its way and now the “ soju ” factory images are officially available as well , which officially brings Sprint 's version of the Nexus S current with the GSM versions of the device . Android AOSP wunderkind Jean-Baptiste Queru takes some time to make some key distinctions of the newly available factory image :
“ This is meant to be used by people who built and flashed their own custom version of AOSP and wish to return to the factory state . If you 're currently running an official retail build , I simply recommend that you wait for the OTA ” .
In summary folks : the factory image is meant for those who well you know… fiddled or tinkered with their device by adding a custom ROM for example– and want to flash their device back to its stock state . If you 're on stock Android now , you 're probably better off waiting for the actual OTA update instead of flashing your device to the latest build . When attempting to flash the factory image to the Nexus S 4G , please be aware that there 's a known bug in the bootloader , you 'll have to boot into whatever version of Android is on your device , and then return to fastboot and restart the flashing sequence .
Happy flashing all !

Fernando Alonso needs to focus on their own team at this early stage of the season , not the fortunes of others © Sutton Images Enlarge Related Links Drivers :
Fernando Alonso Teams :
Ferrari
Personally , I must admit to my disappointment when Fernando Alonso 's DRS stuck open early on in the Bahrain Grand Prix . Sebastian Vettel was already in the lead and - with Kimi Raikkonen so far out of position - their main race challenger was out of contention .
That said , there have now been two instances where I 've been disappointed with Alonso themselves this season ; in their post-race press conferences in both Malaysia and Bahrain . On both occasions , Alonso has talked about how unlucky they have been , and on Sunday evening at Sakhir they said : `` A very , very unlucky race again , so in four races we 've had two very unlucky moments . It will come for the others and we will take the opportunity in that moment . ''
On the face of it , he 's right . Incidents will generally balance out across a season and the likes of Vettel will have problems too . But Alonso needs to be big enough to admit when they or Ferrari has made a mistake and not just attribute poor results to being unlucky . Alonso 's retirement in Malaysia is the real case in point here , but was perhaps lost somewhat in the Red Bull team orders furore .
`` We touched with the front wing the car of Sebastian ; it was a very , very small touch but enough to damage the front wing a lot so it 's extremely bad luck in my opinion , '' Alonso said after retiring at Sepang , adding : `` We touched one car at 10 kilometres an hour and we did n't have even the luck to lose the front wing , the front wing stayed half on to make us crash after one lap . So this is a fact . ''

It was not bad luck . Alonso made a misjudgement ( a small one , admittedly ) and ran in to the back of Vettel . It was their mistake . Millions then watched as the front wing dangled from the Ferrari nose , but Ferrari did n't pit him . That was the team 's mistake . Alonso 's retirement was all of theirs and Ferrari 's making . Bahrain was a mechanical failure on Ferrari 's part and not caused by contact with another car or any strange circumstance . The finger can only point at the team , not at lady luck .
It 's almost certain that Alonso is just trying to deflect the heat away from Ferrari - prior to the race in Bahrain they said Red Bull had the quickest car in China and Kimi Raikkonen is doing the best job - but there could be concern that this is a hangover from the failings of 2012 .
Their eyes in the Interlagos pit lane as they stared at what might have been are part of a lingering image from last year , and it must be difficult to forget such a narrow defeat . However , Alonso ca n't allow the near-perfection they enjoyed last year to cloud their approach to this season ; mistakes need admitting . They have a quicker car , one which completely outperformed Red Bull in China , and they know therefore a better shot at the championship .
Alonso has already had more setbacks than they did in 2012 and on both occasions Vettel has gone on to take full advantage . Alonso and Ferrari ca n't afford too many more which cost it a potential race victory if it wants to end Vettel 's run of titles , and it certainly needs more than luck on its side to do that .

How worried should neighbouring states be about the Islamic State 's expansionist rhetoric ?
The familiar slogan of the Islamic State , baqiyya wa tatamaddad ( “ remaining and expanding ” ) , is indicative of the group 's aggressive , expansionist outlook . The self-proclaimed caliphate , which demands the allegiance of all Muslims , should first encompass the entire Muslim world and should eventually subsume the whole world under its dominion . This ideal has been circulated among members and supporters since the group 's founding , when it called itself the Islamic State of Iraq ( ISI ) . In those days , its ambitions were etched clearly on its flag , with graphics of the globe under the group 's banner . As ISI expanded into Syria , it renamed itself the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria/the Levant ( ISIS/ISIL ) .
As ISIS/ISIL , Lebanon , Jordan , and Israel/Palestine , along with Syria , were ( and still are ) in the group 's sights . Today , under the IS formulation , it is taken for granted that the group will seek continuous expansion at any cost . However , in reality , IS 's overall approach to the region beyond its current bases of operation and control in Iraq and Syria is circumscribed by certain constraints and calculations .
Of the greatest concern is IS 's strategy in Lebanon and Jordan , two countries mentioned in the IS recruitment video released by its Al Hayat Media Center as places to which IS fighters will go if their leader , Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , orders them to do so . Both Lebanon and Jordan are known to harbour domestic elements that support IS .
Lebanon 's problems with IS are tied to the broader issue of Hezbollah 's involvement in the Syrian Civil War and of rebels crossing over into Syria by way of the porous border areas in Qalamoun . Pro-IS sentiment appears to be primarily based in the northern city of Tripoli , a long-standing hotspot of Sunni radicalism . IS 's military capacity to expand into Lebanon , however , remains limited for now . Its main entry point would be through the Damascus province . Here , IS 's presence is much smaller than that in the north and east of Syria , where IS has focused on building up and consolidating its control of territory . In fact , the IS presence in the Damascus province is quite disconnected from the organisation elsewhere , because IS fighters in the area have cooperated with rebels from a range of factions , including Jabhat al-Nusra ( JAN ) and Jaysh al-Islam , with whom the IS incursion into Arsal in Lebanon was undoubtedly coordinated . However , the coordination in Qalamoun between IS and other rebels may now be in doubt : a recent unity statement calling for enemies to be fought and sharia to be applied came from JAN and other rebel groups but excluded IS .
In Jordan , recent months have seen occasional and small pro-IS demonstrations in the southern locality of Ma'an . The Jordanian daily , Al Ghad , reported that the majority of members of the country 's Salafi-jihadi movement have shifted their alliance from JAN to IS . This suggests that support for IS is growing , albeit slowly . The group still maintains an interest in extorting toll fees from vehicles carrying goods entering into Iraq 's Anbar province , close to the Jordanian border . IS has total control over Anbar 's far western areas of Rutba ( near the Jordanian and Syrian borders ) , Al-Qa'im ( on the border with Syria ) , Rawa , and Anah . The other main entry route for IS to expand militarily into Jordan would be through the southern Syrian provinces of Deraa and Suwayda , neither of which has a known IS presence . In fact , since the JAN-IS dispute , militants in both areas are believed to be loyal only to JAN .
Turning to the north , IS 's intentions in Turkey have been the subject of much debate . Despite longstanding concerns in Turkish policy circles over alleged IS plots and threats to launch an attack in Turkey , there is no concrete evidence of either . Statements were circulated under ISIS 's name in the Turkish media in 2013 , but they have all turned out to be unskilled forgeries . Some controversy has also surrounded a supposed ISIS video from March 2014 that threatened an attack if Turkish troops did not withdraw from the site of the tomb of Suleyman Shah , on the grounds that the tomb was within ISIS territory . But the video is of dubious authenticity and the apparent threat was not followed up .
At present , it is clear that IS understands that any deliberate attack on Turkish territory would not be in its interest : an attack would risk pushing Turkey into a direct military intervention in Syria , which would open up too many military fronts for the group to manage . Furthermore , it should be remembered that one factor behind IS 's success has been its ability to profit from local Sunni discontent with the central governments of Iraq and Syria within the hyper-sectarian atmospheres of both countries . In Turkey , there is no such environment to exploit .
As long as the border is not completely shut off , IS depends on Turkish territory for smuggling routes through which it can access the black market . This enables it to purchase goods ( for example , basic commodities , including food and drink ) with which to engage in outreach to locals within its territory in Syria . It also sells the oil that it extracts from the fields it controls in eastern Syria . This remains the case even as Turkey has taken greater measures to stop the inflow into Syria of potential foreign fighter recruits for IS . To assist in opposing IS , Turkey has provided support to rival rebel groups , particularly ones under the banner of the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) such as the Syrian Revolutionaries Front .
IS intends to target two areas in the wider region and IS-linked activity poses a security threat in both places . The first of these is Israel-Palestine . Ideologically , the notion of the conquest of Jerusalem ( Bayt al-Maqdis/al-Quds ) is important in IS rhetoric . One billboard in Hasakah province ( back when the group was called ISIS ) read : “ We fight in Iraq and Al-Sham and our eyes are on Bayt al-Maqdis ” ( a slogan that is also used by JAN ) .
However , the real threat lies to the south , in the Gaza-Sinai area . An identifiable IS network exists here , in the form of Jamaat Ansar al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi Bayt al-Maqdis , which distributes propaganda material in Gaza for IS . This IS network has acted as a feeder group for IS 's Gazan contingent of fighters in the Iraq-Syria arena . The network has expanded after the pledge of allegiance from the better-known group active in the area , Jamaat Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis , now renamed “ Sinai Province ” . Salafi-jihadi groups that oppose the Hamas government in Gaza have been expanding their influence for some time . In five to ten years , they may have the capacity to overthrow the government , which would pose an even greater security threat to Israel and Egypt .
The second area of concern is Saudi Arabia , whose government has been a key backer of FSA-banner forces opposed to IS , including Harakat Hazm in the north , the Southern Front in the south , and the Syrian Revolutionaries Front . Because of this , it is not uncommon for IS circles to refer to Saudi Arabia as the “ kingdom of taghut ” ( idolatry or oppression ) . Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) has not pledged allegiance to IS , but elements sympathetic to IS do exist in AQAP . That there are also IS supporters in Saudi Arabia more generally is reflected in the disproportionate number of Saudi fighters within the group 's ranks .
Reports suggest that IS may be trying to set up terrorist cells within Saudi Arabia , and IS could find Saudi Arabia a convenient target for strategic reasons . IS knows full well that Saudi Arabia would not send troops to Iraq or Syria . And IS could exploit opportunities in Saudi Arabia – such as oil smuggling or the like – to sustain itself in economic terms . The threat to Saudi Arabia is reinforced by IS 's formal acknowledgement of pledges of allegiance of unknown size from within Saudi Arabia as well as Yemen .
Linked to the acknowledgement of pledges of allegiance from abroad is the appearance of “ Islamic State provinces ” in eastern Libya and Tripoli . The emergence of the trappings of a state in the Libyan city of Derna ( including “ Islamic police ” and “ Islamic courts ” ) points to a possible link with the IS Libyan contingent inside Iraq and Syria , Katiba al-Bittar al-Libi . However , it is far from clear that the IS presence can expand much beyond Derna . It must compete with long-established jihadi networks in Libya ( most notably the Ansar al-Sharia movement ) and faces heavy resistance from the Tobruq-based government forces .
Last but not least , it is worth examining IS 's perception of Iran , which it derides as the “ Safavid ” power in the region that sustains the central “ Safavid ” government in Baghdad . Despite its rhetoric , IS , unlike al-Qaeda , does not seem to have any networks or assets in Iran that would enable it to strike at Tehran . Thus , expansion into Iran is off limits for the near future at least .
In assessing IS and its regional strategy , each country must be considered on a case-by-case basis . If IS were to take over the entirety of Iraq and Syria , then all neighbouring countries would face the prospect of invasion . But this outcome seems extremely improbable . IS 's main priorities are still to expand within Iraq and Syria and to consolidate its military and economic power in both countries at the expense of pro-government forces and insurgent rivals . A much more legitimate concern is that IS supporters – not formally tied to the group – might heed IS spokesperson Mohammad al-Adnani 's call to target Americans and other Western citizens by any means necessary and might strike within Western countries and those Arab states that are assisting the United States in its airstrikes on IS positions .

Amongst the controversy of Arthur Suydam and the table space at Montreal Comiccon , Erik Larsen and others pointed out how the promotional images from Arthur Suydam 's official website of their line at a show had been doctored to add people to it .
This was denied by those close to Suydam who described such an act as “ laughable ” .
Well…
It 's not so laughable now .
Thanks to Toronto Joker , hat tip , kav and Jamie Colville . So what did Arthur have to say ? They told Bleeding Cool
“ Thanks for bringing the photo to our attention . I 'm on the road with no Internet , but if it 's the one I think by the description , that 's a rather old one that one of my former assistants pulled off the Internet . Probably a pic that a client was using to promote an appearance…I had liked the photo because it was a side view and showcased the fans as well and the convention experience . It seemed representative . “ We had no idea anything in the photo was apart from the original , since I do have a lot of folks visiting–especially on Sunday when I do free sketches for kids . We do that at all shows and offer other promotions as well– I just assumed it was one of those days . “ I have n't updated that site in years . As said , thanks again for pointing it out . ”

Self-driving cars are coming , and Americans are getting on board .
That 's the conclusion of a new study from the University of Michigan , which found that 56 % of U.S. respondents had positive opinions of self-driving vehicles .
The technology sounds like science fiction -- 29 % of Americans surveyed had n't heard of it before the study -- yet it 's not far from becoming reality .
Google ( GOOG ) has been working on the issue for years , unveiling a self-driving prototype in May . The system probably wo n't be widely available for five or six years , but executives have predicted that one day `` a significant number of cars will carry Google technology . '' Nissan , meanwhile , said last year that it hopes to have a self-driving car on the market by 2020 .
Cool cars : Hot wheels and good deals
California , Nevada , Florida and Michigan have passed legislation allowing the testing of self-driving cars on public roads , and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has issued a series of recommendations on the issue as well .
Those surveyed by the Michigan researchers Brandon Schoettle and Michael Sivak said self-driving cars were likely to yield a variety of benefits , including fewer crashes , decreased emissions and lower insurance rates .
But with that said , they were still hesitant about taking a ride for the time being : just 11 % said they would n't be concerned about riding in a self-driving vehicle .
AURORA | With big names like Amazon gobbling up warehouse space in north Aurora , Majestic Realty Co. is betting big — more than 800,000-square-feet kind of big — on the city 's future as a distribution hub .
The company is set to break ground this fall on three buildings totaling 835,000 square feet at the Majestic Commercenter near Interstate 70 and E-470 .
The project is speculative though , which means Majestic does n't yet have tenants for the buildings . Instead , they 're betting the area will continue to lure companies in need of warehouse and distribution space .
That bet is so large , that Majestic officials say it 's the largest speculative industrial development in the state 's history .
Randy Hertel , executive vice president and director of development , said that while the project is a massive undertaking , they are confident that Majestic will easily fill the more than 800,000 square feet of space .
“ We 've always developed buildings when we felt the time was right , ” they said last week . “ At this point in time , the time is right . ”
The three buildings will be 523,260 square feet , 154,320 square feet and 157,000 square feet , and each will have bay spacing , dock doors , trailer parking and build-to-suit office space , the company said .
“ A big part of being a master-planned business park is the ability to deliver overall flexibility in our structure to meet the diverse size of users and their needs in this market , ” Hertel said in a statement announcing the project . “ We 've seen a lot of activity in that 30,000 to 80,000-square-foot user , as well as the larger industrial tenants , and our park layout and available land put us in a great position to deliver a wide range of non-competing product options for the small , medium and large user . ”
Amazon moved into a more than 400,000-square-foot space at the commercenter this year and Hertel said their arrival , as well as other big-name tenants like GE and Whirlpool , show that the area is attractive for big companies with massive warehouse needs .
Last year , Majestic also bought 530 acres of land adjacent to its existing park and officials say that parcel will let them expand to offer more space to e-commerce companies like Amazon .
“ We 've enjoyed some tremendous success with our most recent buildings and a significant land acquisition , ” Hertel said . “ We 're excited about the opportunities our park provides to diverse users , and we 're confident in our timing to bring the space to the market in anticipation of continued growth late this year and into 2017 . ”
Yuriy Gorlov , business development manager for the Aurora Economic Development Council , said the project is a sign that the I-70 corridor in north Aurora is an ideal spot for warehouse and distribution facilities . While a speculative build is a bit of a gamble , Gorlov said , with vacancy rates for similar space below 5 percent around the region , there is strong demand for warehouses .
While this project is a big one for Colorado , Gorlov said other communities — especially on the coasts and closer to larger population centers — often see similar buildings with more than a million square feet . Because metro Denver is so far from other large cities those projects have n't happened here , but they said that could change going forward .
“ I think we will be seeing the move to larger distribution centers , maybe pushing that million-square-foot space , because of the e-commerce market , ” they said .
PORTLAND , Ore. -- Lucas Orlin Ebert , who made national headlines after they were arrested in 2011 for impersonating an OHSU doctor , is back in court on seven felony charges of sex abuse involving a minor .
Ebert , 27 , of Gresham , was in court Monday . Court documents say the victim is a girl known to Ebert . During Monday 's court appearance , Ebert was instructed to have no contact with the victim . They are being held on no bail because of a parole violation .
The documents say Ebert is a student at Portland Community College . Their next court date is Tuesday , June 13 at 9:30 a.m. for a preliminary hearing .
In 2011 , Ebert posed as a doctor at OHSU for at least two weeks and fooled a female patient into believing they were a plastic surgery resident .
Ebert has a checkered criminal history . They have been convicted of 11 felonies , including criminal mistreatment , practicing medicine without a license , negotiating a bad check , identity theft and forgery .
As a Republican ( in the British sense ) , I was more than a little indifferent to the recent Jubilee hoo-ha , managing to avoid getting even a whiff of bunting or pork pie whilst the rest of the country seemingly went mad . But , in typically myopic lefty fashion , I was startled to see how many of my gay acquaintances were lacing their Facebook profiles with pro-Jubilee posts . As I say , part of this was a form of liberal arrogance , assuming people would follow my viewpoint just because we share a sexual orientation , and then being shocked when they did n't . But reading a Guardian article by Peter Tatchell about the Jubilee highlighted the fact that , all due respect to her , the Queen has never been a friend of the LGBT community . In fact , they and their family have overtly snubbed us , in ways they would n't with other communities . In that light , the fawning of gay people over the Jubilee takes on a different light .
Equally , I was staggered to see 5-star reviews of The Iron Lady in gay magazines such as Gay Times , and , again , gushing messages about the film from gay people on Facebook and Twitter . Whatever one thinks about the film 's apolitical intentions , Margaret Thatcher 's government ushered in Section 28 , the most homophobic law since decriminalisation in 1967 . I know Meryl Streep is a gay icon , and was not flying the flag for Thatcherism , but any positive portrayal of Maggie ( and let 's not kid ourselves - The Iron Lady comes as close as possible to being a whitewash ) should , I think , give any gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender person pause for thought . That Section 28 did n't even crop up in the film was disgraceful ( not to mention all the other shameful things they did ) . The idea that we , as a community , can be so quick to forget our recent history , is for me deeply troubling .
It 's probably not that surprising . For me , coming out was a tortuous and difficult experience . Not vis-a-vis family and friends , who 'd always known intuitively , and were overwhelmingly supportive , but personally : I simply could n't equate my bi- or homosexuality with the fact that I loved heavy metal and noise music , was tall and gangly rather than slight and effeminate , and had no interest in the mainstream of popular culture . Because that is the norm . Even rugged bears tend to be more into Scissor Sisters than Eyehategod or Throbbing Gristle . By the time I came to deal with my sexuality , the culture I adored , from art-house movies to avant-garde performance art to extreme music , had become my world , and as I ventured out into London 's Old Compton Street , I found few , if any , reflections of that world around me in the neon lights and cheap pop of the gay scene .
Now , of course there are exceptions . Not all LGBT people are indifferent/oblivious to Black Sabbath or Bergman or JG Ballard . Not all LGBT people are obsessed with their hair , the latest Lady Gaga single and Judy Garland , and it 's reductive to think so .
But , to use a tiresome cliche , stereotypes contain a bit of reality , and I collided with this reality as I embraced , and slowly became put off by , mainstream gay culture . As someone in thrall to noise , punk , horror films and experimental art , I like and admire culture that goes against the grain , that fights with and assaults convention . And there was a time when being LGBT meant that by definition you were confronting the status quo . We are `` queers '' , and that term in itself remains both unsettling and empowering : we go against the norm . That led to Ginsberg , Baldwin , Sontag , Burroughs , Wojnarowicz , Mapplethorpe , Montano , Hujar , Stein , Cage , Warhol , Waters , Jarman , and so many others .
In most cases , exploring and confronting sexuality was a key factor in their art , and one that defied conservatism and prejudice . Where is that defiance now ? I may have come along generations later , but my mindset is still informed by the Stonewall riots . And I am staggered that so many younger gay guys ( I can not realistically speak for the lesbian community , and would not have the presumption to try to do so ) seem unaware of , or indifferent to , that seismic event . Where is the rebellion , and self-affirmation , in the constant X Factor/Big Brother love-ins that seem to dominate modern gay culture in the UK , to the point that Alexandra Burke or Cher Lloyd headlining at Heaven is considered a major event ?
It 's a sad by-product of the society we live in , of course . As LGBT people have become more visible and welcome in mainstream society , so we have floated onto the radar of businesses and media moguls smelling an audience and a set of customers . Homosexuality has become commodified , and the upshot is that easy-sell stereotypes have flourished . I am staggered at how many covers of Attitude and Gay Times feature shirtless straight celebrities undressed for the delectation of gay readers . Do we really want to propagate the myth that gay men ca n't be trusted not to dribble over straight guys ? Inside , the pages are filled with fashion blurbs , pop hysteria and endless advertising .
Meanwhile , the Daily Mail or Heat Magazine 's salacious and intrusive celebrity gossip pages are hugely popular with young gay men , fuelling the cliche that , as a grouping , we are shallow , unimaginative and obsessed with appearance ( apparently , few of these gay chaps see the irony in adding to the hit count of the Mail , a newspaper seemingly hell-bent on setting back gay rights by a good decade or four ) . Of course , straight people are equally corralled into easily-targeted consumer groups , and respond with equal amounts of vacuous enthusiasm - my `` gay conundrum '' is a reflection , I think , of a greater social malaise . But , in general , most straight people have not had to sweat blood and tears to get to this point .
Even writing the above , however , fills me with anxiety . I do not want to seem a snob , condescending , or humourless . I certainly do n't want to generalise . The fact is that these new trends are an unfortunate side-effect of something much more positive : acceptance . In the UK , and most of the West , being gay is no longer deemed something worthy of contempt or condemnation . We live in a post-Queer As Folk world , where LGBT people are visible and , mostly , welcomed . And , to put aside my snide aside earlier , we now have pop artists such as The Scissor Sisters and Patrick Wolf that have followed in the tradition of Marc Almond and Boy George by visibly , even brazenly , putting their `` alternative '' sexualities at the forefront of who they are . And where their forebears were met with resistance , even anger , these artists are now feted around the world .
That is surely something worth celebrating , and as I gaze at younger LGBT people walking openly through the streets of London , I feel my heart soar . They may be very different to me , but they are free , unmolested by prejudice and self-doubt , there for the world to see . It 's beautiful ( although I could point out that , with Queer As Folk now long gone , we seem to be quietly reverting to the John Inman version of gay-ness , at least on TV and in pop music : camp , but fundamentally sexless and therefore inoffensive . And , as Luke Turner recently explored on this website , let 's not even mention bisexuality , one of the ultimate taboos for both gay and straight people ) .
In such circumstances , it 's too easy to become complacent . In 78 countries it 's currently illegal to be gay or lesbian . In several , it 's enough to be sent to the gallows . In the build-up to Euro 2012 , a lot was made of fears of racism , but very little about the fact that one of the co-hosts - Ukraine - plans to bring in their very own equivalent of Section 28 , or the fact that across Eastern Europe and beyond , gay pride marches are the targets of violence and intimidation . In the US , one loses count of the number of nasty homophobic comments and even proposed laws that crop up across nearly every state .
Meanwhile , the proposals in this country to allow LGBT people to marry in civil ceremonies has met with an almighty backlash , with some frankly hateful things being said , notably by Conservative politicians . Finally , HIV infection rates are on the up among young gay men , as ignorance replaces awareness . Being LGBT is getting better , but it 's still far from easy , and charities such as Stonewall need the support of the LGBT community more than ever . What 's worrying is how few LGBT people , especially of the generations below my own , seem willing to address these issues , and continue a fight that started decades ago but still needs fighting . Apathy and materialism are proving to be the LGBT community 's biggest self-destructive enemies .
To get back to my lament over the Jubilee and The Iron Lady , what seems apparent is that the fundamental selfishness that underlies conservatism has now infected the gay community , and suddenly solidarity is hard to come by . Like all people , us gays and lesbians want the latest phones , music and fun times . Greater acceptance has given us room to embrace ourselves , which is amazing , but also to embrace consumerism , and therefore distance ourselves not only from our not-too-distant past , but also from the reality faced by millions of less fortunate LGBT people around the world . So , we forget the risk that Allen Ginsberg took in publishing Howl and the tremendous bravery of the Stonewall rioters and Peter Wildeblood , but we also ignore the terrible things that happen to gay people in Iran or Uganda . We sit in G-A-Y and sip our vodka-tonics , whooping when the latest Nicki Minaj song comes on , and ignore that politicians working in our name are trying to forbid us the same rights as straight people .
In this context , the recently scaled-back , float-less , London Pride presents an opportunity : to reconnect with the values and objectives that animated the very first marches of its kind , as the individuals in the procession are brought closer to those watching and cheering . As I walked ( in agonising stilettos and a luscious wig ! ) along the route recently , I was struck by the number of political messages exhibited by my fellow marchers , as I 'm sure everyone standing on the pavement must have been . Most expressed either revulsion for current Tory policies or support for gay people living in countries where the kind of freedoms we take for granted are forbidden . It reminded me that solidarity and awareness are still fundamental values of the LGBT community , and can still be driving factors for us . Obviously , the chance to preen and party eventually won out over the strong messages , as Soho was transformed into a gay version of Oldham city centre on a Friday night , but the fact that political stances and mobilisation are still a reality is cause for cautious optimism .
So I make no apologies for lamenting a lot of what has happened to the community I intrinsically , and gratefully , belong to . Conservatism in the gay community is sparking indifference and amnesia , as it is among every other social group in the country as a whole , even as vicious cuts threaten of livelihoods of nearly each and every one of us , bar the proverbial 1 % . We need to remember the risks and sacrifices so many LGBT people , both famous and everyday , took to get us to the comfort zone we now reside in . We need to reject the bland stereotypes we are being drawn into . We need to be aware of our history , and our precarious present , and not discard them in favour of trinkets and catchy music . We need to lend our voices to those LGBT people around the world and here in the UK who have none . We need to be militant , proud and unrepentant . Yes , it 's amazing how far we 've come . Yes , it 's wonderful that we can be seen and heard and accepted by the rest of society here in the UK . But the road first walked by the great cultural and political pioneers of the LGBT community is far from completed . Rolling over and accepting ignorance and disparity for the sake of a smartphone , a pop hit or a quick buck will ultimately undermine everything we 've achieved so far . Let 's not sacrifice the legacy of those giants , or the hopes of those less fortunate than us .
U2 Trade in Raleigh Concert for Louisville on Joshua Tree Tour 2017 ?
Original Story by Aaron J. Sams ( 2017-03-03 )
On Friday January 6 , 2017 , the Friday before the dates were to be announced for the Joshua Tree 2017 Tour , a rumoured schedule of tour dates was shared with us from a reputable source . That advance schedule had a date in place for U2 in Raleigh , North Carolina . However , when the dates were finally announced on Monday of that week there was no longer any mention of the Raleigh concert , nor was there any show scheduled for that particular date . The rumour shared with us had Raleigh scheduled for a June 16 , 2017 concert . Every other city mentioned on that initial list of shows was announced on January 9th when the tour was announced .
That date went unannounced for several weeks , but on January 30 , 2017 , it was announced that U2 would be playing Louisville , KY , and that date was set for June 16 , 2017 . That was the same date initially listed for Raleigh in the schedule shared in early January .
Now there is further confirmation about U2 's possible plans to play Raleigh , NC . In an article with BizJournals.com , North Carolina State University athletics director Debbie Yow explains that the so-called “ Bathroom Law ” in North Carolina has had an impact on their budget :
“ It has already hurt us , ” they say . “ We had a concert lined up that would have been here in June . And they passed on us and went to Louisville . We were in negotiations with them and as part of the negotiations , they finally got around to talking about HB2 and decided they did n't want to bite this off . ”
What is the only concert showing up on the schedule thus far for Louisville ? U2 .
Yow did not confirm that the concert was U2 , however “ Biz has confirmed it was U2 . ”
House Bill 2 is the bill that has been quite controversial , and has caused other acts to avoid North Carolina . Last April Bruce Springsteen canceled a show in Greensboro show over the same legislation , Ringo Starr has also canceled appearances in North Carolina . The state has also lost a 400-job expansion by PayPal , lost a number of conferences , and also lost the 2017 NBA All Star Game . It now seems like U2 is part of that list of lost opportunities .
The bill requires that transgender people in government buildings use bathrooms that match the sex on their birth certificate , and prevents local governments from taking steps to ban discrimination against lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people in employment and public accommodations .
U2 have been a supporter of gay rights in the past . Most recently , during the early stages of the Innocence and Experience tour , Bono spoke on several occasions in advance of Ireland 's Marriage Equality Referendum . “ Marriage is nearly impossible . Wherever it is occurring it should be encouraged. ” they said in Vancouver . In the lead up to the referendum , U2 posted an image on their Instagram account that said “ In the name of Love… # vote yes ” . After Ireland voted yes , U2 adopted “ People Have the Power ” as an opening song for each concert for the remainder of the tour . Bono also welcomed the so-called “ Queen of Ireland ” onstage , prominant LGBT-rights activist Panti Bliss onto the # U2ieTour stage when the tour returned to Dublin that fall .
It 's not the first time U2 have missed a show in Raleigh . Twenty years ago on May 29 , 1997 , U2 were due to play a concert at Carter-Finley Stadium and it did n't happen . The concert had to be cancelled due to weather damage to the screen on the PopMart tour sustained at the previous concert . The date was not rescheduled , and instead refunds were given . U2 's only concert in Raleigh , October 3 , 2009 , during the U2360 Tour also had some issues after traffic problems caused many fans to miss the opening of the show .

One box arrived three days ago , but my Secret Santa had anonymously let me know that one more would be coming , so I waited until both were here before opening .
I opened the ThinkGeek box first . Inside , I found two , programming-themed beer glasses . Clearly , my Secret Santa had done their homework ! It is , of course , necessary to ensure that the glasses are fully functional . Fortunately , I happened to have on hand a bottle of Knee Deep Brewing Simtra Triple India Pale Ale . I have put these glasses through an exhaustive functional test and can confirm that they work as designed .
Next , I opened the Amazon box . inside , I found two wrapped packages , with a nice note . It read : `` in joining this year 's RedditGifts , I decided to ship from your wish list . It was quite hard to bring myself to send someone books for Christmas , even more so MATH BOOKS ! All kidding aside , I wish you and your family the greatest holidays , filled with tons of happiness and prosperity ! Enjoy , Mike ( mvescio ) ''
Here , I should point out that I get the same reaction from members of my immediate family . `` Your wish list is all math books ! '' You mean yours is n't ?
I unwrapped two books : `` Basic Abstract Algebra : For Graduate Students and Advanced Undergraduates , '' and `` In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman : Mathematics at the Limits of Computation . '' I 'm going to start reading the former as soon as I submit this post .
I may be a geek , that I 'm a very happy geek tonight ! Thank you so much , Mike ! Merci beaucoup à mon Père Noël anonyme ! Bonnes fêtes !
On Friday 's “ PBS NewsHour , ” New York Times columnist David Brooks of showing compassion towards hurricane victims in Puerto Rico and noted the lesson that people in Puerto Rico “ do n't look like a lot of people in Texas . ”
Brooks said , “ [ T ] here was total graciousness toward Texas , and graciousness toward Florida , but he 's incapable of showing any compassion and graciousness toward people who are just trying to find drinking water in Puerto Rico . And so , the lesson is — the lesson that we 're all going to draw from that , that the people in Puerto Rico do n't look like a lot of people in Texas . And I think that 's probably a pretty fair judgment . ”
They added that Trump 's “ default position is never compassion and friendship . Their default position is attack if you attack me . And that 's just characterological . And they bring it into the situations where compassion would be 99.9 % of humanity 's normal response . ”

OTTAWA – Rob Oliphant believes they were uniquely suited to chair the special joint parliamentary committee that wrestled with the emotionally and politically charged issue of an individual 's right to seek medical help to die .
As a United Church minister for 30 years , the Liberal MP has sat “ many , many times ” at the bedsides of dying individuals , offering prayers , counsel , comfort or just an ear to listen to their final thoughts .
And he 's helped guide family members as they agonize over whether to turn off life support machines that are keeping a loved one breathing .
Such cases , they say , raise social , theological and ethical questions which “ demand you to have an understanding of what is compassion and what is pain and what is suffering and how do you make sense of this thing called life . ”
Most people , they muse , do n't like to talk about death or confront profound questions like what constitutes quality of life or how to deal with unbearable suffering .
“ These are questions that I 've had to deal with my whole life , ” Oliphant said in an interview .
The issue of medical assistance in dying is deeply personal for everyone , each person 's views informed by their beliefs , their own experience with death and suffering , their fears and hopes about the manner in which they will meet their own end .
And it 's no different for the politicians who will ultimately determine how broadly or narrowly to give effect to the Supreme Court 's ruling that the law must recognize the right of consenting adults enduring intolerable mental or physical suffering to seek medical help to end their lives .
Oliphant 's committee this week came down on the side of permissiveness , recommending a regime that would make it relatively easy for consenting adults to obtain medical assistance in dying , extend it through advance directives to people diagnosed with capacity-impairing diseases like dementia and , eventually , give mature minors an equal right to choose a doctor-assisted death .
For Oliphant , the recommendations flow from their experience at the bedsides of dying parishioners , where he 's sometimes found they have “ more intimacy than family because people will tell you things that they wo n't tell their own family . ”
“ Most people I have talked to express more fear of living with a debilitating disease than dying from it , ” they say .
“ They really are anxious about the journey , they 're anxious about pain , they 're anxious about prolonging and they would like some kind of way of saying goodbye and knowing that that would be when they 're saying goodbye . ”
Oliphant believes that just knowing they have the option to choose medical assistance to end their lives will be a comfort to people who are suffering . But they doubt many will actually follow through .
“ I really believe that there 's a stage in a dying person 's cycle where they 're very nervous about potential suffering … and they doubt their own capacity to handle it and they really hope there 'll be something to help them , ” they say .
“ I really think that the incidence of using medical assistance in dying will be quite small , that people will generally want to hold onto life and they will recognize that their suffering is n't as bad as they thought it was going to be and they 'll actually have more courage because they know they have the option . ”
For those facing a diagnosis of dementia or other degenerative conditions that rob them of their mental capacity , Oliphant says the fears are different : loss of dignity and loss of identity .
“ I think that 's why people are looking for advance directives because they know there 'll be a moment in their life that they 're no longer themselves and they do n't want that . ”
While they respect that , Oliphant says dementia is not personally “ a big worry ” for him , he 's “ kind of interested to know what that experience would be like , whether there is a kind of cognitive capacity that we just do n't know about that 's there . ”
Still , if there 's anything he 's learned in their ministry , it 's that life is “ an individual journey ” and each person must come to terms with their mortality in their own way .
“ I put life at the top of the list of values but it has to have quality associated with it , not just a quantity , that life that is not acceptable to someone then becomes not life . ”

EDINBURG — The roommate of a 21-year-old man found shot to death inside their apartment early Wednesday morning has been charged with murder , according to police .
Victor Lee Alfaro , 25 , of Weslaco had been staying at the victim 's apartment in the 700 block of South Fourth Street when a verbal dispute escalated to a fatal shooting , Edinburg Police Assistant Chief Oscar Treviño said .
“ They got into an argument , and the suspect shot them three times with a 9 mm pistol , ” Treviño said . “ We are not sure what led to the argument . ”
On Wednesday afternoon , Alfaro went before a municipal court judge , who charged them with first-degree felony murder and aggravated assault , a second-degree felony . The judge also issued a $ 1 million bond before remanding them to the Hidalgo County Jail .
Reynaldo Reyes , of Edinburg , was found by first responders about 1 p.m. suffering from at least three gunshot wounds and rushed to a local hospital where they were later pronounced dead , Treviño said .
“ Ant-Man ” on IMDB
Adventure / Sci-Fi / Action , 117 Minutes , 2015
The overwhelming success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has allowed them a certain leeway ; certain freedom to experiment . While this has n't yet resulted in something truly insane , like a film led by a woman , it has allowed them to explore some of the quirkier ideas and characters available in the vast Marvel catalog . Two years ago , this led to the explosive success of Guardians of the Galaxy [ IMDB ] and now it brings the closest we 've come to a straight Marvel comedy .
In the 1960 's , Hank Pym ( Micheal Douglas [ IMDB ] , doing their best curmudgeon ) invented a formula to alter the distance between atoms . They implemented the technology in a suit that allowed them to shrink to the size of an insect while retaining their full-sized strength . Later that same afternoon , they also perfected a method to mentally control ants , because comics . They completed many missions for the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. , but became worried that their technology would be used for evil and left .
Now , their former student , the unhinged Darren Cross ( Corey Stoll [ IMDB ] ) , is getting closer to reverse-engineering their formula with a mind to create an unstoppable weapons platform . Pym enlists Scott Lang ( the supernaturally charming Paul Rudd [ IMDB ] ) to become the new Ant-Man . An ex-con imprisoned for a Robin Hood-style theft , Scott is working to redeem themselves with their family and get visitation rights with their daughter . With the help of Pym 's estranged daughter , Hope ( Evangeline Lily [ IMDB ] ) , they plot to destroy Cross 's project before it causes global havoc .
The movie plays with perspective and scale exceedingly well . Battles range seamlessly from the micro to the macro and back again with nary a one-liner missed . The effects are what we 've come to expect from Marvel movies at this stage : bombastic CGI . Unfortunately , despite the overall quality , the actual ants are a disappointment . They look more plastic than organic – presumably to “ soften ” them for the audience – and it makes emotional connections with them difficult to establish .
Rudd is a fantastic casting choice . Their proven record at comedy may not seem , at first blush , to make them an obvious action hero but it makes them perfect for this action hero . Ant-Man walks a taut tightrope between seriousness and absurdity , something Rudd manages exceedingly well . Michael Peña [ IMDB ] also deserves a mention : they bring a warmth and exuberance to what would have ended up as one-dimensional comic relief in other hands .
Overall , it suffers many of the same minor pacing and exposition-dump issues that plague most origin stories . The cast is large and the characters need backstories and introductions . This is offset by the action sequences , which are tight and well-choreographed , even if they do have a tendency to break rhythm to service a gag .
As exciting as the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been , it 's difficult to ignore the fact that the movies have enjoyed a certain sameness . I am pleased to say that Ant-Man does not feature a giant structure crashing into a city . It does feature charming characters , a comfortable story and a hell of a lot of fun .
Gov . Terry Branstad ( Photo : Special to the Des Moines Register )
Correction : A previous reference to an online database incorrectly stated the number of countries from which refugees arrived . The correct number is 21 .
Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad on Monday ordered state agencies to halt any work on Syrian refugee resettlements in the wake of the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris .
“ We have welcomed refugees from around the world into Iowa , '' Branstad said in a statement . `` We must continue to have compassion for others , but we must also maintain the safety of Iowans and the security of our state . Until a thorough and thoughtful review is conducted by the intelligence community and the safety of Iowans can be assured , the federal government should not resettle any Syrian refugees in Iowa . ”
In a Monday morning news conference , Branstad had left open the door to Syrian refugee resettlement , saying they were unsure whether states had the authority to block it . ( Legal scholars expressed doubts that they do . ) But by afternoon , Branstad had acted to shut the door .
Database : 1,700 refugees arrived in Iowa since 2012 | DesMoinesRegister.com
News reports that one of the suspects in the Paris terrorist attacks entered Europe among the surge of Syrian refugees have fueled a wave of controversy across the country as governors and presidential candidates seek to address the issue .
RELATED :
Branstad joins more than 20 other governors — including Republican presidential candidate and Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal — who are taking action to block any federal efforts to relocate Syrian refugees in their states .
Rand Paul , GOP presidential candidate and U.S. senator from Kentucky , also introduced legislation Monday that would suspend visas for refugees from countries considered a high risk for terrorism and impose a waiting period for background checks for visas issued to residents of other countries .
That 's in contrast with Democratic candidates for president , who have called for compassion in admitting displaced Syrians . Former Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley , at a stop in New Hampton on Monday , called for 65,000 Syrian refugees to be admitted into the United States , saying they 're also victims of terror .

No Syrians so far
Currently , federal programs work to place refugees in states . Once they arrive , state agencies help them find housing and assist them in other ways .

Ben Hammes , communications director for the governor 's office , said that if the federal government does decide to place Syrian refugees in Iowa , those services would no longer be available to assist them as a result of Branstad 's action Monday .
“ We 're trying to send a message that we do n't want them to come here until there 's been a thorough and thoughtful review , ” Hammes said .
John Wilken , chief of Iowa 's Bureau of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Human Services , said he 's not aware of any Syrians who have been admitted to the state , or of any who have resettled in Iowa after being admitted into other states .
Iowa originally was expecting to admit 800 refugees from around the globe in the next fiscal year . After President Barack Obama called to increase the number of refugees admitted into the country by 10,000 during the next fiscal year , Wilken said there could be an additional 100 to 120 people brought into Iowa .
They said at this point it 's not clear where the refugees would be from or whether the full number would come to Iowa .
Currently , the majority of refugees who settle in the state come from Burma , Bhutan and Iraq , and they are coming to Iowa because they have family members already here . Wilken said they are also unaware of any Syrian communities in the state that would draw refugees to Iowa from elsewhere in the country .
Concern over decision
Robert Kupitz , a co-founder of the Refugee Resource Center in Des Moines , cautioned against overcorrecting in the wake of terrorism in Paris by shutting out people who need assistance .
“ I think the great , the vast majority of the refugees who arrive in Iowa are very thankful to be here and are positive additions to our state , ” they said . “ Obviously what happened is terrible , and any policy person would condemn it and be horrified by it . But that does n't mean we should throw the babies out with the bathwater . ”
Jeremy Rosen , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa , said in a statement that they were `` deeply disappointed '' by Branstad 's decision , calling it `` both morally and legally wrong . ''
`` These refugees are fleeing terrorism in their home country , '' they said . `` Politicians should not falsely link the tragedy in Paris with the settlement of Syrian refugees in the United States . Iowans are welcoming people who understand our moral obligation to help people in need . ''
Rosen said Branstad has no authority over refugee resettlement , calling it a federal matter , and urged them `` to reconsider this rash decision , and to stop engaging in fear-mongering . ”
Branstad reversal
Branstad 's decision late Monday reverses previous statements he 's made on the issue . In their Monday morning news conference , they stopped short of saying they would block Syrian refugees in Iowa .
Instead , they focused on ensuring a careful screening process as well as open and transparent communication with the federal government about who is admitted into the country and where they 're placed .
“ I share the concern of the other governors about the safety and well-being of our citizens , after what we saw happen in Paris , ” they said Monday morning . “ We do n't want to become like Europe , where they let all these refugees in , and now they 're faced with sending their police out to try to find out and round up the dangerous embedded ISIS militants that are part of it . ''
In September , Branstad said that welcoming displaced Syrians to Iowa is a good thing , provided they are carefully vetted and documented .
“ I think Iowans are very open and accepting to immigrants in situations like this , ” they said at the time .
Monday afternoon , Branstad said they remained unsure whether a state has authority to block refugee resettlement .
“ I do n't know if we do , but I see state after state saying the same thing that we 're saying , '' Branstad said . `` This is a federal system where there 's supposed to be respect for the interests of the states as well . And we the states are concerned about the well-being of our citizens . ”
National response
Obama said Monday that , despite the attacks , they plan to move forward with plans to admit into the country a greater number of refugees .
`` We also have to remember that many of these refugees are the victims of terrorism themselves . That 's what they 're fleeing . Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values , '' Obama said in Turkey on Monday , USA TODAY reported . `` Our nations can welcome refugees who are desperately seeking safety and ensure our own security . We can and must do both . ''
Obama also condemned comments made by Republican presidential candidates calling for only Christian refugees to be admitted into the country .
`` We do n't have religious tests to our compassion , '' they said .
Among the candidates who have advocated blocking Syrian refugees is Ben Carson , who leads in Iowa polling .
Carson issued a news release saying they sent a letter to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan calling on the U.S. House of Representatives to immediately terminate all public funding for federal programs that seek to resettle Syrian refugees or migrants into the United States .
U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa said Monday at a news conference , where they endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for president , that refugees and immigrants admitted into the United States wo n't assimilate into American culture and uphold the idea of the American dream .
`` We need a president who understands that , and one who will restore this civilization , ” they said .
They said steps need to be taken to protect Christians abroad .
“ The Christian refugees , they are subjects of genocide , '' King said . `` I would do the things that we can do to save them . But , I think that we should create international safe zones for them so they can repopulate the areas they 've been driven from . If we just evacuate people out that have been subjects of violence , who is going to repopulate that country ? ''

Ben Baird has been busy . And the chef has got some nasty burns to show for it .
“ How did you get those ? ” I ask the co-owner of Ottawa Streat Gourmet , their scorched hand in a glove .
I 've come to their prep kitchen on Sheffield Road to meet Inuk chef Trudy Metcalfe and learn more about the Flavours of the North event for which they are collaborating . And maybe to charm my way to tasting whatever it is that 's making the kitchen smell so fabulous .
“ Roasting bones , ” was the answer to the burning question . But not just any old bones . These are caribou bones , and hundreds of pounds of them . Baird 's about to start a second boil of the roasted bones , and has just finished cutting 500 lbs of mirepoix and potatoes . ( So their hand is now both burnt and cramped… ) This , in preparation for Flavours of the North , a feast on Parliament Hill this weekend in celebration of our country 's northern foods . It 's part of the twilight cluster of events as the Canada 150 celebrations draw to a close . Admission : Free .
The bones came with 770 lbs of boneless caribou stewing meat , sourced by Metcalfe . Born in Nain , the most northern and largest community in Nunatsiavut , raised in northern Newfoundland , and now an Ottawa resident for the past 30 years , Metcalfe approached their pals at Kivalliq Arctic Foods in Rankin Inlet for enough caribou to feed an estimated Parliament Hill crowd of 10,000 this weekend .
Baird ladles up a taste of the first batch . The stew is quite wonderful , the meat remarkably tender , peppery , perfumed with sage from Baird 's garden , cooked long and slow with onion , garlic , carrot , celery , and potatoes in reduced caribou stock . Truth is , I had two bowls . Metcalfe had one . There should be another 9,997 left for you this weekend , served from the Streat food truck .
When : December 9th and 10th , from 1 pm to 4 pm on Parliament Hill
Cost : Free
Details : Flavours of the North gathers together Canadian Indigenous and non-Indigenous chefs in a celebration of northern foods . Dished up from food trucks will be caribou stew , smoked arctic char chowder , firepit-cooked bannock and traditional Labrador tea , wild blueberry and sweetgrass sherbet . Chuck Hughes will be hosting cooking demonstrations , including one by our own brilliant Parliament Hill chef , Judson Simpson with Christina Nakogee Robertson of Toronto 's Tea-n-Bannock .
Other chef partnerships include Toronto chef Susur Lee with chef Cezin Nottaway of Wawatay Catering , and Vancouver chef Vikram Vij will team up with chef Trudy Metcalfe .
In Canada , we have the sad legacy of our most marginalized citizens feeling under attack by the police state , bureaucracies and political leaders such as Stephen Harper who do n't care if a First Nations woman cries out , `` Am I Next ? ''
`` Am I the next victim of personal or systemic violence ? '' One more addition to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) statistics ( May 2014 ) show that 1,017 Indigenous girls have been murdered between 1980 to 2012 . The violence experienced by Indigenous women is more severe than average and more severe than what the statistics report -- crimes are not always reported .
And what of the violence occurring now throughout the U.S. -- young , black males fear becoming a statistic , as twenty-nine Black males have been killed by Police/Security since Jan 2012 , with sixteen of those since Trayvon Martin was shot .
The blog Bougie Black Girl lists the names of black women and girls who were killed by law enforcement , as well .
These are difficult numbers to have to swallow , but someone has to ask . And they will prompt difficult questions about the nature of the quality of life in North America ?
If 1,017 white women had gone missing or had been murdered , would there have been a different response ?
What if the twenty-nine males who have been killed by police had been white ? I 'm not saying that white males are not also shot dead by the police , but the context and public and official reaction is different .
It is a tragedy of our human society that , advanced in so many different ways that we are , with super-computers and attempts at Space Exploration , we still struggle to cope with the socially marginalized .
For all politicians and economists care , at least we can keep the market machines turning , in both countries , despite the blaring social inequality down the hill and outside the gates of their mansions .
This is what caused Indigenous women to start spreading their own message to the world through the hashtag # AmINext .
This is the voice of an Indigenous woman asking if they are next to be assaulted or killed at the hands of others -- perpetrators could range from intimate partners , to truck drivers along lonely , northern roads , to the police themselves .
By posting their photos on Twitter using # AmINext and carrying `` Am I Next ? '' placards at demos , these women want the world to see that it is a human being who disappears , one with a face and a family and dreams , not just another statistic after the fact .
The grassroots `` Am I Next ? '' campaign highlights the concerns of these communities . According to a 2014 Human Rights Watch report , `` In five of the 10 towns Human Rights Watch visited in the North , we heard allegations of rape or sexual assault by police officers . ''
We are seeing a similar phenomenon in the states , though by no means would anyone assume this context behind `` Black Lives Matter '' is a new development in the struggle for social justice .
In the United States , the recent killings of Trayvon Martin , Michael Brown , Eric Garner and Tamir Rice ( for example -- there are many examples ) has caused a spasm of demonstrations against police-based racist violence and murder from Miami to Oakland to Ferguson to New York .
Demonstrators from different U.S. cities use geographically bound slogans such as , `` Hands Up , Do n't Shoot ! '' for Ferguson to `` I Ca n't Breathe '' in New York , but under the umbrella term `` Black Lives Matter . ''
For Canada and the United States , it 's the same fight .
In America 's street , we see both women and men -- whole targeted populations -- chanting , `` Hands Up , Do n't Shoot '' and `` I Ca n't Breathe '' while hopefully more and more Americans ( and Canadians ) will want to affirm their basic right to be treated like human beings with dignity , as they ask society as a whole , `` Am I Next ? ''
Perhaps one day Indigenous communities and people of colour can stand as one and leave the fear embedded in `` Am I Next ? '' behind as we would together bring an end to violence against any marginalized group . If the state ca n't protect people , in fact targets people , anyone should protect themselves .

The Chinese billionaire gives six classes a year , and each class lasts three days , Malaysia 's Kwong Wah newspaper reported on Monday ( May 22 ) . Fees can cost up to 99,800 yuan for the course , which is targeted at entrepreneurs , said Lianhe Wanbao .
Ma , 52 , has been a long-time fan of martial arts , and has reportedly practised taiji quan from 1988 . They have also previously spoken about their bodyguard , a taiji master born in the birthplace of taiji in China 's Chen Jia Gou , in Henan Province .
Just this month , Ma had spoken out about a taiji master 's defeat by a mixed martial art ( MMA ) fighter , which went viral .
They said on their Sina Weibo account that the two styles could not be compared as they operated by different rules .
While the incident stirred debate on the practical use of taiji , Ma said that it was definitely practical in real combat , but that such instances would be rare as most taiji practitioners perform the art for exercise .
`` Taiji was invented neither for attack nor defence , but as a movement to illustrate its philosophy , '' they wrote . `` Attack and defence are part of taiji , but definitely not all of it . ''
Ma had in 2011 set up an online academy called Taiji Zen with actor Jet Li teaching the martial art and associated meditation techniques .
According to the site , the program consists of nine levels and is targeted at working professionals , martial artists and athletes .
On the site , Ma distinguishes taiji from taiji quan - the former being a philosophy and the latter the martial art itself .
Ma has previously been quoted saying taiji quan is not just a good form of gongfu , but is also good for business .
In an interview with Bloomberg TV in 2015 , Ma said taiji `` is about how you balance and how you work '' .
They said : `` Taiji is like 'you fight there and I 'll go over here . You 're at the top , and I 'll go down ' . It 's a balance . You are heavy and I 'm small . When I 'm small , I can jump . You 're heavy . You can not jump . Taiji is about a philosophy . I use taiji philosophy in the business . Calm down . There 's always a way out and keep yourself balanced . ''
I 've been thinking lately about some of the challenges of blogging . ( Millennial Star recently had a really interesting discussion about Bloggernacle dynamics here , and I 've also been thinking about some of the issues regarding audience that Eve raised several years ago in this post . Additionally , T & S recently had a conversation about the boundaries of the “ Bloggernacle ” , and its relationship to LDS blogs more generally . ) And one particular question I 've been contemplating goes back to a much-debated question : what are the issues at stake when we publicly discuss more difficult aspects of the church ? ( As long as I 'm linking , I 'm pretty sure that Kaimi had a post several years ago , which I ca n't seem to find , on the question of whether we should ever say anything negative about the church when non-members might be listening . )
Over the years , I 've seen more than one commenter explain their comments in terms of the need for balance—strikingly , not as a virtue in and of itself , but specifically because non-Mormons might be reading . ( I 'm not sure “ balance ” is the best term here , because I have n't observed that blogs which emphasize the more traditional kind of faith-promoting material are particularly concerned about balancing out their own views , either . ) But in any case , I do have some sympathy for this view . I can appreciate the desire to represent the church fairly . I get annoyed when people make negative generalizations about all Mormons ( we 're a bunch of sheeple who do n't have the ability to think critically , etc . )
I can also respect that different blogs are aimed at different audiences . Where I find myself disagreeing , however , is with any assertion that it 's the responsibility of all blogs which classify themselves in the believing category to stay focused on the positive , because of the concern that non-members might get a bad impression of the church . I find this problematic for several reasons :
1 ) I think this approach potentially undermines our ability to have genuine conversations with each other . If one ( or more ) participants in a discussion are always talking with an eye toward missionary work and/or public relations , they ca n't really be said to be engaging the others who are actually participating in the conversation . And it 's frustrating to talk to people who are are n't actually talking to you , but to an imagined non-member audience who might happen to be watching .
2 ) I think this approach can actually detract from the positive potential of the Bloggernacle . If hordes of non-Mormons are indeed hanging around , I think there 's value in giving them a chance to see real Mormons talking about their various questions and perspectives on things . I would be quickly bored if I encountered another religious blogging community whose members made sure all their posts and comments were sufficiently faith-promoting . I did my master 's in theology at a Catholic school , and I loved getting to hear Catholics discussing and debating and sometimes critiquing their tradition . I enjoyed the opportunity to eavesdrop on people who were working to make sense of their faith , rather than being careful with what they said because I was there . It did n't at all make me think less of Catholicism ; in fact , it made me appreciate its richness and complexity .
3 ) I see the Bloggernacle as actually challenging some common stereotypes of Mormons . For example , people sometimes get the impression that we 're a homogeneous cult that all thinks the same and marches in lockstep . Fifteen minutes on the bloggernacle , seeing people arguing at length about topics from caffeinated beverages to polygamy , is likely to quickly disabuse them of this notion . Even the feminist blogs , which are sometimes dismissed as simply apostate , implicitly send the message that there are a wider variety of Mormon women than one might initially assume . When I 've talked to non-members about the existence of Mormon feminism , they 've generally been fascinated , and excited to hear about it .
4 ) When people have concerns about the church , I think that attempting to come up with clear answers is n't always that effective . In my experience , at least , seeing that there people who have difficult questions who still stick around is much more helpful . It actually testifies to the power of the church . My close non-LDS friends know a whole lot about what I think is problematic about my religion ( just as I know a lot about their relationship to their churches ) . And several have told me that the fact that I stay despite all that is something that actually gives them a positive view of Mormonism .
You might point out that the Bloggernacle is n't exactly representative of the population of the church , and I would certainly agree . But I 'd note that potential converts are n't homogeneous any more than are Mormons . Some of them may be drawn to the lds.org vision of the church . But others may be drawn to the kinds of discussions found elsewhere .
5 ) I have concerns about saving discussions of difficult issues for private settings in which only insiders are participating . One problem is that of people who feel that they were deceived when they only find out some of the skeletons in the closet after they join the church . I also do n't think we should pressure people to frame all their experiences into a faith-promoting narrative ; I 'd hope we have room as a church to allow for a variety of experiences , including difficult ones . I actually think that this can make testimonies more credible , not less .
6 ) I suspect that people are most likely to get a negative impression of the church not from the content discussed , but from the way we treat each other . When we 're busy calling each other to repentance and generally acting obnoxious , I imagine that does n't speak very well to our character as a people . ( I say “ we ” , because I 'm not claiming to have a stellar record on this one . )
I 'm not saying , just to clarify , that blogs whose primary focus is on the positive aspects of the church , are necessarily being disingenuous—my impression is that they 're usually quite sincere . I see different blogs as aimed at different audiences , and I respect that . What I 'm critiquing here is the notion that discussing negatives is somehow a betrayal , or makes a blog less faithful .
In my own blogging , I think the best I can do is talk honestly about my experience of the church , which is complex and messy and involves both faith and doubt . And when it comes to ZD , I wo n't presume to speak for my co-bloggers , but I hope to be part of creating a space where people who might feel marginalized and un-heard at church can have a voice . Of course , we are n't limited to feminist or other controversial topics , and some of what we do is just downright silliness . ( What can I say ? That 's the family culture in which I grew up . ) But at its best , I really do believe that Bloggernacle-style blogging , with all its questioning and craziness , actually has much of value to offer .
Developer Mika Mobile has a long and complicated history with Android . It very publicly dropped support for the platform back in 2012 before slinking back in 2014 with Battleheart Legacy . It launched a new game last week , and now there are two more listings from Mika Mobile—one new and one back from the dead . Yes , Zombieville USA 1 and 2 are on Android .
The Zombieville USA games are simple side-scrolling beat-em-ups set during a zombie apocalypse . You have to make it through each stage without getting your brain eaten . At your disposal are various weapons that can be unlocked with the cash you pick up in the game . The two games are very similar , but the second one has more unlockable content and it looks nicer .
Left : Zombieville USA , Right : Zombieville USA 2
Zombieville USA 2 is a completely new listing on Android as it was only ever available on iOS . The original game was on Android years ago , but was delisted when the developer chose to stop supporting it . Now , it 's back with new chapters that never made it to Android . The original Zombieville USA is free ( neat ) and the second one is $ 0.99 with no in-app purchases .
A new study describes how bacteria use a previously unknown means to defeat an antibiotic . The researchers found that the bacteria have modified a common “ housekeeping ” enzyme in a way that enables the enzyme to recognize and disarm the antibiotic .
The study appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Bacteria often engage in chemical warfare with one another , and many antibiotics used in medicine are modeled on the weapons they produce . But microbes also must protect themselves from their own toxins . The defenses they employ for protection can be acquired by other species , leading to antibiotic resistance .
The researchers focused on an enzyme , known as MccF , that they knew could disable a potent “ Trojan horse ” antibiotic that sneaks into cells disguised as a tasty protein meal . The bacterial antibiotic , called microcin C7 ( McC7 ) is similar to a class of drugs used to treat bacterial infections of the skin .
“ How Trojan horse antibiotics work is that the antibiotic portion is coupled to something that 's fairly innocuous – in this case it 's a peptide , ” said University of Illinois biochemistry professor Satish Nair , who led the study . “ So susceptible bacteria see this peptide , think of it as food and internalize it . ”
The meal comes at a price , however : Once the bacterial enzymes chew up the amino acid disguise , the liberated antibiotic is free to attack a key component of protein synthesis in the bacterium , Nair said .
“ That is why the organisms that make this thing have to protect themselves , ” they said .
In previous studies , researchers had found the genes that protect some bacteria from this class of antibiotic toxins , but they did n't know how they worked . These genes code for peptidases , which normally chew up proteins ( polypeptides ) and lack the ability to recognize anything else .
Before the new study , “ it was n't clear how a peptidase could destroy an antibiotic , ” Nair said .
To get a fuller picture of the structure of the peptidase , Illinois graduate student Vinayak Agarwal crystallized MccF while it was bound to other molecules , including the antibiotic . An analysis of the structure and its interaction with the antibiotic revealed that MccF looked a lot like other enzymes in its family , but with a twist – or , rather , a loop . Somehow MccF has picked up an additional loop of amino acids that it uses to recognize the antibiotic , rendering it ineffective .
“ Now we know that specific amino acid residues in this loop are responsible for making this from a normal housekeeping gene into something that 's capable of degrading this class of antibiotics , ” Nair said .
With this information , researchers – and eventually , doctors and other clinicians – will be able to scan the genomes of disease-causing bacteria to find out which ones have genes with the antibiotic-resistance loop in them , Nair said . “ If we know what type of bacteria are causing an infection we know what kind of antibiotic to give and what kind not to give , ” they said .
Nair also is an affiliate of the Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology , the department of chemistry and of the Institute for Genomic Biology at Illinois . The research team included scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences and Rutgers University .

Fifty years after President Johnson started a $ 20 trillion taxpayer-funded war on poverty , the overall percentage of impoverished people in the U.S. has declined only slightly and the poor have lost ground under President Obama .
Aides said Mr. Obama does n't plan to commemorate the anniversary Wednesday of Johnson 's speech in 1964 , which gave rise to Medicaid , Head Start and a broad range of other federal anti-poverty programs . The president 's only public event Tuesday was a plea for Congress to approve extended benefits for the long-term unemployed , another reminder of the persistent economic troubles during Mr. Obama 's five years in office .
“ What I think the American people are really looking for in 2014 is just a little bit of stability , ” Mr. Obama said .

Although the president often rails against income inequality in America , their policies have had little impact overall on poverty . A record 47 million Americans receive food stamps , about 13 million more than when they took office .
The poverty rate has stood at 15 percent for three consecutive years , the first time that has happened since the mid-1960s . The poverty rate in 1965 was 17.3 percent ; it was 12.5 percent in 2007 , before the Great Recession .
About 50 million Americans live below the poverty line , which the federal government defined in 2012 as an annual income of $ 23,492 for a family of four .

President Obama 's anti-poverty efforts “ are basically to give more people more free stuff , ” said Robert Rector , a specialist on welfare and poverty at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
“ That 's exactly the opposite of what Johnson said , ” Mr. Rector said . “ Johnson 's goal was to make people prosperous and self-sufficient . ”
The president 's advisers defend their policies by saying they rescued the nation from the deep recession in 2009 , saved the auto industry and reduced the jobless rate to 7 percent from a high of 10 percent four years ago .
Gene Sperling , the president 's top economic adviser , said Mr. Obama has pulled as many as 9 million people out of poverty with policies such as extending the earned income tax credit for parents with three or more children and reducing the “ marriage penalty . ”
“ There are things that this president has done that have made a big difference , ” Mr. Sperling said Monday .
The White House again is pushing for an increase in the federal minimum wage , this time advocating a Senate bill that would raise the hourly rate to $ 10.10 from its current $ 7.25 . Mr. Sperling said that action would lift another 6.8 million workers out of poverty .
“ It would make them less dependent on government programs . It would not add to the deficit one penny , but it would reward work and reduce poverty , ” they said .
The president is expected to use their State of the Union address Jan. 20 to pressure Congress to raise the minimum wage . They made the same pitch a year ago .
Democrats are advocating issues such as unemployment benefits and the minimum wage especially hard this year as the class-warfare rhetoric heats up to frame the congressional midterm elections . House Republican leaders oppose increasing the minimum wage and want unemployment benefits to be paid with savings elsewhere in the budget . Mr. Obama is insisting that the benefits be extended without offsets .
The president last month declared the widening gap between rich and poor as “ the defining challenge of our time , ” and Democratic candidates are expected to pick up that theme on the campaign trail rather than debate deficits and the complications of Obamacare .
In spite of the administration 's anti-poverty efforts , however , the government reported this week that poverty by some measures has been worse under Mr. Obama than it was under President George W. Bush . The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 31.6 percent of Americans were in poverty for at least two months from 2009 to 2011 , a 4.5 percentage point increase over the pre-recession period of 2005 to 2007 .
Of the 37.6 million people who were poor at the beginning of 2009 , 26.4 percent remained in poverty throughout the next 34 months , the report said . Another 12.6 million people escaped poverty during that time , but 13.5 million more fell into poverty .
Mr. Rector said the war on poverty has been a failure when measured by the overall amount of money spent and poverty rates that have n't changed significantly since Johnson gave their speech .
“ We 've spent $ 20.7 trillion on means-tested aid since that time , and the poverty rate is pretty much exactly where it was in the mid-1960s , ” they said .
The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report that some trends have helped reduce poverty since the 1960s , including more Americans completing high school and more women working outside the home . But the group said other factors have contributed to persistent poverty , including a tripling in the number of households led by single parents .
Mr. Rector said too many government anti-poverty programs still discourage marriage , factoring into statistics that show more than four in 10 children are born to unmarried parents .
“ When the war on poverty started , about 6 percent of children were born outside of marriage , ” they said . “ Today that 's 42 percent — catastrophe . ”
What is LinkedIn SREs ?
Site Reliability Engineers at LinkedIn are responsible for architecting and operating a reliable , accessible site for our more than 313 million members . We operate over 450 independent services to bring you LinkedIn and are responsible for making sure these services are always available , worldwide , no matter what .
This is an awesome responsibility , and it 's one that requires a certain type of person . One with a unique set of skills , who… .
( I do n't know where in the code you are , NullPointerException , but I will find you , and I will debug you . )
( I do n't know where in the code you are , NullPointerException , but I will find you , and Idebug you . )
Well , maybe not quite that extreme . But it does need someone special . You not only have to have the skills to operate a site of our scale , but you also have to be able to write and read code to help debug problems and automate your work . When you have over 40,000 production servers to deal with , you ca n't do anything one machine at a time . You 've also got to be able to architect services to operate in an environment with multiple active datacenters , handling tens of thousands of queries per second , and that can stay up even if other services are down or slow . If that is n't enough , you have to be able to talk to other engineers , management , your peers , and more – all while sometimes in the middle of troubleshooting problems that can create a lot of stress .
The process we use
Hiring these people is hard . Finding them is hard and then verifying they have these skills in a reasonable amount of time is even harder . In this post , I 'll talk about the typical hiring process for SREs at LinkedIn . It all starts with some phone calls . First off , one of our recruiters will call you and ask you about why you 're considering LinkedIn , what your availability is , and then will ask you some common knowledge systems administration questions . Assuming you pass those , we send you through to a code-focused phone screen with an existing SRE . During this phone screen , we 'll ask you to do some code problems that are mostly related to things you might do on this job , like log parsing or using a RESTful API .
Once we 've determined you can code , you 'll do another phone screen with an SRE where we ask you about operational issues – things like how the Internet works , what you 'd do in the shoes of a LinkedIn SRE to help scale the site , and how you would envision monitoring a site as complex as ours . Assuming that goes well , we have you come on site to meet the team .
How we make it interesting
Once you 're on site , the real fun starts . It 's usually a few hours long , but we pack a lot in . During your onsite , you 'll get to experience lunch at the office ( each office with SREs has daily lunch provided ) and meet one of the SRE managers , who will have you tell them war stories and otherwise share some data about who you are and what you 're looking for from your next opportunity .

We ca n't let you get away without assessing your technical skills , and for most interviews we have 3 separate chances while you 're on site for you to do that . A big part of the interview involves a live troubleshooting exercise . This is as real as it gets as an SRE – you will be given a laptop connected to a running service , and will have to troubleshoot some problems with it . It 's just like being oncall , only with a buddy there to help you if you get stuck . ( If you 've never been on call before , you 're in for a treat - but basically , being on call means you are responsible for your part of the LinkedIn infrastructure , 24/7 , for a whole week ! You have help , but you 're the first point of contact . ) During the exercise , you can use your favorite search engine , look at man pages , anything else you 'd normally do to troubleshoot .
One of the cool things about being an SRE at LinkedIn is that any time some problem happens , you are quite likely the first person in history to troubleshoot that exact issue . Given the complexity of our stack and the interactions between services , every time is like the first time . That 's why we have the live troubleshooting module – we want you to experience what this is like !
In addition to the live troubleshooting exercise , another important part of being an SRE is triaging issues . Eventually , you 'll be on call ( see above ) and responsible for the operation of the site . When that happens , you might see several alerts all firing at the same time . We 'll ask you to prioritize a sample set of alerts and to talk about why you prioritized them in that way – and then we 'll ask you some troubleshooting questions . This activity is also designed to emulate what you really do on the job and to give you a taste of what it 'd be like as a LinkedIn SRE . You wo n't have our awesome tools like inGraphs , but the activity is designed such that you wo n't need them .
We usually end by having you get in front of a whiteboard and talk architecture with us . A huge part of the SRE role is to be involved from the beginning with architecture and design decisions for new LinkedIn services . So , as part of the interview process , we 'll ask you to walk us through a standard large-scale website architecture . We 'll talk about strong points and weak points . We 'll challenge you with failures of components . We 'll ask about how to handle fault-tolerance , geographic distribution , cache-busting , and all the other things you have to consider operating a site at the scale that we do .
SREs at LinkedIn have to move quickly to solve problems and we also move quickly after your interview . We 'll let you know within a few days ( no weeks-long processes here ) and then if all goes well , you 'll get to jump in and start helping us build opportunity !
Our engineering slogan is `` Build Opportunity '' . It really encapsulates what we do here at LinkedIn . We create economic opportunity for every professional in the world .

Please go to this link and submit your LinkedIn profile and you 'll hear from us . We have positions in Mountain View , Sunnyvale , San Francisco , New York , and Bangalore – so no matter where you roam , you 're likely not far from a LinkedIn SRE !
According to CryptoVest , crypto-mining marketplace NiceHash is gearing up to make a complete comeback following a hacking incident earlier this month , and has assured users that it will recompense all stolen funds .
The Slovenia-based cloud mining service fell prey to a cyber-attack on December 6 , during which 4,700 BTC were stolen from its payment system – Bitcoin was trading at around $ 14,000 then , which meant the theft amounted to more than $ 64 million . At the time , the company claimed the breach was “ a highly professional attack with sophisticated social engineering ” , and that NiceHash would be collaborating with local authorities to investigate the matter .
The latest development in the case sees the company reinstating its services . A letter , signed by NiceHash marketing director Andrej P. Škraba , was recently emailed to customers , assuring them that NiceHash is working on getting the service up and running again , and fully intends to restore users ' balances .
“ Despite the unfortunate event , we are letting you know that our service will be resumed today and your money will be paid back . ”
According to the letter , the balances of sellers or buyers of processing capacity will be restored by January 31 , 2018 . Škraba also revealed that NiceHash had succeeded in reserving funds needed to reimburse balances with the aid of a group of international investors , and that the company was currently involved in the settlement of legal issues . Urging users to be patient , the letter went on to state :
“ We are truly sorry for any inconvenience that the hack may have caused . We hope you will want to continue to invest your money and your faith in the world 's largest crypto-mining marketplace . ”
An update was also shared on the company 's Twitter page shortly after the letter was sent out , announcing that NiceHash was back online , although some minor issues were still being ironed out .

Amsterdam is apparently the first European city to have a North Korean restaurant , which opened in January at the edge of the city in Osdorp . It has a cultural centre attached to it as well , although many people are sure it 's a propaganda centre . In fact , it 's been almost impossible to talk about restaurant Pyongyang , named after the North Korean capital , without it turning to politics .
Owner Remco van Daal keeps reminding the press and their patrons that their restaurant and the cultural centre is not politically motivated , but it 's a hard sell because in Asia , Pyongyang restaurants are associated with money laundering . If we could have Russian restaurants a few decades ago in the West , we should be able to have North Korean ones as well . And which major European city does n't have an Italian restaurant with ties to the mafia ? Van Daal could be telling the truth , they could also be lying , but encouraging their restaurant is optional .
Two friends of mine went to Pyongyang for dinner , one for their birthday and to indulge in their fascination of dictators ( no pics of Kim Jong Il there since their portrait may not be filmed ) , the other went with friends who are actually going to visit North Korea this spring . They both said it was expensive and not particularly special food-wise , but the song and dance provided by real North Korean women is worth experiencing at least once .
In this video you 'll see the clumsy decor and lighting with North Korean art on the walls , the food and the traditional song and dance . And if my friends or other patrons are horrible people for funding an oppressive regime , so are people who consume Nestlé products or whatever else that is on the current bad corporations hit list . And consuming questionable products has always been optional .

The Rich Earth Institute in Brattleboro , Vermont , aims to shift how we think about our own waste . They want to `` close the nutrient cycle '' by using our urine to grow what we next consume .
Today , most human waste in the U.S. flows down the pipes to a facility such as DC Water 's Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant , the largest facility of its kind in the world . Blue Plains receives an average of 370 million gallons of wastewater , 94 percent of which is from residential sources in the District of Columbia and parts of Maryland and Virginia . This includes what washes down the kitchen drain , fills up washing machines , and flushes down toilets .
Once at Blue Plains , it all goes through a multistage process in which it is passed from pool to pool of various hues of reddish brown , where the liquid is stirred , bubbled , fed to algae , and filtered until it is clean enough to get dumped back into the Potomac River .
Much of what this process is doing is removing nitrogen and phosphorous , elements that can be pollutants when too much of them get into our rivers and oceans . But they are also essential nutrients for plant growth—and thus , two of the basic components of fertilizer .
Most conventional farms invest in synthetic fertilizer , which requires energy to produce and is associated with many environmental problems of its own . But by separating out human urine before it gets to the wastewater plant , Rich Earth cofounder Kim Nace says they can turn it into a robust fertilizer alternative : a `` local , accessible , free , sanitary source of nitrogen and phosphorous . ''
Since its founding in 2011 , the Rich Earth Institute has received a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) and was selected for funding from the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) for future research and development . Among other projects , the institute is researching methods that `` farmers who ca n't afford to pay for chemical , commercial fertilizers can adopt . ''
Useful Nutrients
According to the World Health Organization , human urine makes up less than one percent of the domestic wastewater treated at a facility such as Blue Plains , but contains 80 percent of the nitrogen and 55 percent of the phosphorous . When these nutrients get into our rivers and streams , they can cause algal blooms , for the very same reason that they 're so great for farmers ' fields : because they enable growth .

With enough nitrogen and phosphorous , algae can grow until they have consumed all of the available oxygen in the area , making it a `` dead zone '' in which nothing else can survive . This problem led to a provision in the 1972 Clean Water Act that requires wastewater treatment facilities to largely remove these nutrients before the water is released back into our rivers , a process that is both costly and energy intensive .
`` If you can keep the urine out of the wastewater , you do n't have to waste the resources in removing the urine downstream , '' Abraham Noe-Hays , Rich Earth 's other founder , explains .
Although urine is perfectly sanitary after pasteurization , and effective for agricultural use , many still feel a significant `` ick '' factor when it comes to using urine to grow food .
`` We 're all afraid of our own waste , '' Chris Peot , manager of resource recovery at DC Water , explains . But they think that response can be worked around—the necessary paradigm shift is already underway . `` This is sort of our new mantra : There 's no such thing as waste , only waste of resources , '' Peot says .

Peecycling 's History
In fact , `` peecyling '' is a mainstream notion elsewhere in the world . Urine diversion for fertilizer can be documented back to 1867 , and the U.S. is just starting to catch on to the trend that has become increasingly popular in countries such as Finland , Sweden , and the Netherlands over the last decade or so .
Amsterdam 's water utility facility , Waternet , even held public demonstrations in November in which men were encouraged to use public urinals to collect their urine for use in rooftop gardens , in order to publicize their belief in the power of urine .
And it 's not just the developed world . Since 2006 , National Geographic Emerging Explorer and grantee Sasha Kramer , a soil scientist , has been installing dry composting toilets that convert human waste into useful fertilizer in Haiti . The nonprofit group they cofounded , Sustainable Organic Integrated Livelihoods ( SOIL ) , hopes to address the country 's poor sanitation while creating employment and providing fertilizer .
Kramer 's simple toilets separate urine and feces , which are covered with dry material to reduce odors . The material is regularly collected and then composted in an eight-month process that kills pathogens ( see video ) .
The Future ?
There are currently no plans to utilize urine separation at DC Water , but Peot can see its potential . `` There are plenty of facilities in D.C. where we could do urine separation , '' they say . `` Nationals Park—you get [ tens of thousands of ] people there , all taking a pee . We could do urine separation , and then we do n't have to bring it down to the treatment plant and spend money and energy and chemicals to get the phosphorous out . ''

However , urine separation at Nationals Park would require substantial infrastructure changes in order to re-plumb , to prevent the urine from mixing with the solids , which are much more likely to carry disease . For now , Rich Earth is working on a smaller scale , collecting urine in jugs from their neighbors and encouraging them to install special urine-diverting toilets in their own homes .
Nace and Noe-Hays have found themselves pleasantly surprised by the positive response they 've gotten from urine donors at home in Brattleboro . They managed to collect and recycle 3,000 gallons of urine in 2013 , and hope to increase that by 2,000 gallons this next year .

Gearing up for the coming Lok sabha elections , the Maharashtra unit of the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) has moved into top gear , hoping to widen its support base by bringing in rebel Mumbai Congress leader Ajit Sawant and also roping in the Shetkari Sanghatana led by Sharad Joshi , a well-established organisation agitating on various farmers ' issues for the last 35 years . The strategy appears clear -- woo known faces and public figures , cast the net wide in Mumbai and also in rural areas of the state . Maharashtra is a key state for the Aam Aadmi Party , not only because this is the birthplace of the India Against Corruption movement to which most senior AAP members of Maharashtra belong , but also because IAC and AAP members have built a large support base here .
Anjali Damania , convener of the Maharashtra unit of AAP , talks about the party 's strategy for Lok Sabha elections .
Rebel Congress leader Ajit Sawant has joined AAP . Is the party open to all Congressmen ?
The party membership is open to all including political leaders from the other parties . Leaders from all political parties in the state are finding AAP a good platform and are joining it . As for rebel Ccongress leader Ajit Sawant , I do n't know them personally but what I know that they are a good and non-corrupt person . They have fought against corruption within their own party and has taken on senior Congress leader Kripashankar Singh . Sawant has also exposed BJP leader Nitin Gadkari 's alleged links with the Purti group . Since they are fighting corruption like us , they are welcome in the party .
What if they are a Congress decoy like some are saying about Vinod Kumar Binny in Delhi ?
We can not compare Sawant and Binny . Both are totally different . AAP is such an organization that we do n't have a cadre system like other conventional parties . So , joining AAP is like becoming a member only .
Is this a sign that the Congress is your chief rival ? What is your strategy to counter your rival ?
The 128 year old party has been downsized to just eight seats out of 70 Assembly seats in Delhi despite being in power for the last 15 years . The Delhi elections clearly showed that the Congress party has become insignificant . So , in fact , we no longer feel the Congress is our main rival . We feel the BJP is now the main rival for us .
Our strategy is to give the best candidates against the heavyweights like we did in Delhi by fielding Arvind Kejriwal against the former chief minster Sheila Dikshit and like our plan to field AAP leader Kumar Vishwas against Rahul Gandhi in Amethi . A similar strategy will be followed in the state . Soon , I am going to undertake a tour of Baramati to address a rally there and then to Madha ( which is the constituency of union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar ) . Since it is not clear who is contesting from these constituencies ( since Pawar has dceided to take the Rajya Sabha route to Parliament ) , we have not decided on our candidates .
On the one hand you are saying the BJP is AAP 's main rival and on the other hand AAP leader Praful Vora extended support to a BJP corporator from Andheri ( West ) Ameet Satam recently , when the latter went on hunger strike for a week on the issue of poor illumination in the area .
I really do n't know about this and wo n't be able to comment on it .
Interestingly , if we protest on the common man 's issues , then we are called ‘ anarchist ' . But , if a BJP corporator and a Congress MP sits on a hunger strike or carries out a morcha , then the same is not applied to them despite the fact that BJP is in power in the civic body and the Congress in the state government .
Please tell about the Lok Sabha strategy being worked out by AAP in Maharashtra .
We are yet to decide on whether to contest all 48 Lok sabha seats in the state . But , if we get the best candidates , then we will contest all the seats . We have received the lot of applications from candidates who wish to contest Lok Sabha elections . The process of scrutinizing the applications and interview process is going on . We will be able to release the first list of candidates for the Lok Sabha elections in the next week .
In the past you have targetted NCP leaders including Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Irrigation Minister Sunil Tatkare . Will you continue doing that ?
We will continue to expose political heavyweights in the state including Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and their other ministers , BJP leader Nitin Gadkari and leaders from other political parties . We have gathered so much information on Gadkari 's business dealings that we can make one expose every week . We are also gathering information about other political leaders and plan to divulge it during the election campaign .

Some 19,000 years ago , a woman was coated in red ochre and buried in a cave in northern Spain . What do their remains say about Palaeolithic life in western Europe ?
Lawrence Guy Straus
They were privileged to have a tombstone , and their grave may have been adorned with flowers . But the many who , for millennia after their death , took shelter in El Mirón cave in northern Spain must have been unaware of the prestigious company they were keeping . Buried in a side chamber at the back of the cave is a very special Palaeolithic woman indeed .
Aged between 35 and 40 when they died , they were laid to rest alongside a large engraved stone , their body seemingly daubed in sparkling red pigment . Small , yellow flowers may even have adorned their grave 18,700 years ago – a time when cave burials , let alone one so elaborate , appear to have been very rare . It was a momentous honour , and no one knows why they were given it .
“ It 's an area in the cave right where people were living , ” says Lawrence Guy Straus at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque . Along with Manuel González Morales of the University of Cantabria , Straus has been leading the excavation of El Mirón for 19 years . “ It 's not hidden away . This person in death was kind of presiding over the activities of their people . ”

“ She 's not hidden away . In death , they were kind of presiding over the activities of their people ”
The Red Lady , as researchers are calling her , was a member of the Magdalenian people of the late Upper Palaeolithic . They would have been anatomically just like us , they had clothes and probably language , too , and belonged to social networks that spread across Europe . But although they lived in large numbers in Portugal and Spain , and archaeologists have been searching for burial sites for nearly 150 years , the Red Lady 's grave is the first Magdalenian burial found in the Iberian peninsula ( Journal of Archaeological Science , doi.org/2t8 ) .
“ This person was given some kind of special treatment . God only knows why ”
“ The Magdalenian age saw a real explosion in the number and abundance of art , and in the realism of the animals represented , ” says Straus , especially in sites in northern Spain and France . The El Mirón cave has its share , including an engraving of a horse and possibly one of a bison too . But most intriguing are the lines scratched upon the 2-metre-wide block of limestone behind which the Red Lady was buried . What looks like a mess of fine , straight lines could actually be far more significant .
“ The lines seem to be sort of random , but there is a motif that is a triangle – repeated lines that make a V-shape , ” says Straus . “ What is being represented , at least by some of these lines , might be a female person . Conceivably , this block serves as some kind of marker. ” It 's as if the Red Lady had a primitive tombstone stating they were female ( Journal of Archaeological Science , doi.org/2t9 ) .
Them remains were discovered when Straus 's team began digging behind this block in 2010 . Radiocarbon dating reveals that the block fell from the ceiling at most only a few hundred years before the woman was buried in the narrow space behind it . “ The block was engraved more or less contemporaneously with the burial , ” says Straus .
Lawrence Guy Straus
Dozens of researchers have been excavating El Mirón since 1996 , with around 20 working on the Red Lady 's grave since it was found . When they began digging , they discovered the jawbone ( see picture ) and shin bone ( tibia ) almost immediately . Both were bright red – although they have since faded – a sign that the woman had been covered in red ochre , a specially prepared iron oxide pigment that humans appear to have slathered on their dead for thousands of years . “ It goes back to pre-Homo sapiens , ” says Straus . “ This is a colour that in their lives must have been very spectacular , ” they say , suggesting that its blood-like hue may have symbolised life and death .
The people who buried them used a special form of ochre , not from local sources , that sparkled with specular haematite , a form of iron oxide . It may have been applied to their corpse or clothes as a preservative or as a ritual . The regular use of red ochre at burials throughout the Upper Palaeolithic elsewhere in Europe implies this formed part of a burial rite , says William Davies of the University of Southampton , UK . “ It is certainly possible that [ these people ] held spiritual beliefs , ” Davies says .
Chewed by canines
But the skeleton is incomplete , a fact that may be linked to gnaw-marks on the tibia left behind . The pattern of black manganese oxide , which forms on bones as bodies rot , shows that a carnivore – about the size of a dog or wolf – took to the tibia some time after the flesh had decomposed .
After this incident , a number of large bones , including the cranium , seem to have been removed , perhaps for display or reburial elsewhere . Many of the remaining bones , including the tibia and jawbone , were treated once again with red ochre , possibly to resanctify them ( Journal of Archaeological Science , doi.org/2vb ) .
María-José Iriarte-Chiapusso and Alvaro Arrizabalaga at the University of the Basque Country in Spain have taken a different tack , focusing on the pollen found at the burial site . They found an unexpected preponderance of pollen from the Chenopod group , which includes plants like spinach ( Journal of Archaeological Science , doi.org/2vc ) . Chenopod pollen is rare at archaeological sites from this period , and the high concentration found by the researchers does n't match the patterns at burial sites in areas where these plants were a food source , says Iriarte-Chiapusso .
It is possible that the plants were used medicinally at this time , but that would still fail to explain the high levels of pollen . “ The extraordinary nature of the finds within the burial suggest that [ the plants ] had been deliberately sought out for some purpose related to the deceased , ” says Arrizabalaga . This leads the team to believe that the woman 's people may have left a floral offering at the grave , probably of small , yellowish flowers .
“ You ca n't get away from the conclusion that this person , [ out of ] the hundreds and perhaps thousands of Magdalenians who once existed for several thousand years in Iberia , was given some kind of special treatment , ” says Straus . “ God only knows why . ”
Could they have been some sort of leader or queen ? “ We do n't really know much about the social structure of these hunter-gatherers , whether they were matriarchal or patriarchal societies , ” says Ignacio de la Torre of University College London . “ But certainly hunter-gatherer societies had no queens or kings , ” they say , as they did not have much of a social hierarchy .
The people who buried the woman may have had some strong emotional connection with her , suggests Davies , or perhaps they were exceptional in some way . “ For example , ” they say , “ some individuals buried in Italy have skeletal abnormalities and might have been seen as a special people , thus warranting a separate burial . ”
Whoever they are , the Red Lady lived at a time when Europeans were recovering from the worst of the last ice age , about 21,000 years ago . Many people took refuge in Iberia and southern France , and then expanded back out across the continent . Straus hopes that the Red Lady 's DNA – to be analysed by Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany – will provide evidence that it was these Magdalenians in south-western Europe who went on to repopulate northern areas , including Belgium , Germany and the UK .
Perhaps the DNA will reveal that many Europeans today can trace their ancestry back to their artistic kinsfolk .
The paleo diet , for real Do you want to keep on-trend with the latest fashionable diet ? Then look to the Red Lady of El Mirón , who ate the Paleo diet almost 19,000 years ago . For her , it was no fad . The isotopes in their dental enamel , microscopic wear patterns on their teeth and the stuff embedded between them reveal that the meat of hoofed animals made up about 80 per cent of their diet . That means you might want to add red deer and ibex to your shopping list . Pick up plenty of salmon , too – fish seems to have made up most of the rest of their diet . If that sounds a little dull , fear not . Meticulous dental analysis reveals they also ate some starchy plant material , most likely to have been seeds , plus mushrooms , although probably in small amounts ( Journal of Archaeological Science , doi.org/2t7 ) . Whether fungi were eaten for nutrition or for some other purpose is unknown , says Lawrence Guy Straus of the University of New Mexico . Could the diet revealed by this unique fossil from northern Spain make you live a longer , healthier life ? Although the surviving bones of the Red Lady suggest they were healthy , their age at death was between 35 and 40 . That may have counted as middle-aged for people who lived in Palaeolithic times , says William Davies of the University of Southampton , UK . Perhaps you 'd better stick to a balanced diet with five portions of fruit and vegetables a day .

On the Monday broadcast of their MSNBC program Hardball , host Chris Matthews trashed those who believe in the Second Amendment and gun rights .
While discussing this weekend 's NRA convention in Houston , Texas with Howard Fineman and NBC 's Kasie Hunt , Matthews explained why they believe there is an `` overlap of birtherism and guns '' in pro-gun circles . Matthews said gun rights activists `` do n't accept an African-American president '' and view everything as `` totemic '' and `` iconic . ''
CHRIS MATTHEWS , MSNBC : To everybody watches , this is n't just about guns -- is about guns . It is about this war in this country , that 's gotten more divided , more polarized . And it 's about symbols like telling you you ca n't have certain kinds of gun . You need certain kinds of freedoms with your gun , like no background checks . Or that you have an African-American president .
Now , here 's an example , the birther thing . It all ties together . You have to explain to me how they see the overlap of birtherism and guns , because I see it . Here 's the new NRA president , Jim Porter . They also do n't sound like he 's willing to go in that middle line there across the aisle . Last year they made a speech not only referring to Civil War as the war of northern aggression , here we go again , but also invoked birther language . Now , I missed this last week . Birther language . Watch them here talk about our fake president .
[ START VIDEO ]
JAMES `` JIM '' W. PORTER II , NRA PRESIDENT : The NRA was started 1871 right here in New York state . It was started by some Yankee generals who did n't like the way my Southern boys had the ability to shoot , what we called the war of Northern aggression . Y'all might call it the Civil War , but we call it the war of Northern aggression down South .
I get so sick and tired of all these people with this fake president that we got who wants to say , 'Well , you know , they have n't done anything bad for gun owners . ' I say , let me tell you something bad he 's done . Their entire administration is anti-gun , anti-freedom , anti-second amendment .
[ END VIDEO ]
MATTHEWS : I do n't know if he 's burning books there or not . Let me tell you , Kasie [ Hunt ] , it 's a lot that lays on your shoulders . I have to tell you this . I see a far bigger fight than over background checks and gun shows . It 's culture war . They do n't accept an African-American president or president of color who has some antecedence in Africa . No . It has to be us or him . And our guns or him . And everything is totemic ; everything is iconic ; everything 's fighting words . What was it feeling like down there ? Did n't they react when they hear this kind of talk ?
The Pentagon today halted all discharges of gay troops under `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' and will now accept applications from prospective recruits who are homosexual , the Army Times reports .
But it 's still not clear whether the Obama administration will turn to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court Wednesday banned further enforcement of the policy , which has prohibited gays from serving openly , writes the Army Times , which is published by USA TODAY 's parent , Gannett Co. Inc .
Congress repealed the law in December after a federal judge ruled that DADT was unconstitutional . The repeal stipulated that DADT would be formally repealed 60 days after the defense secretary and chairperson of the Joint Chiefs `` certify '' that it will not adversely impact military readiness .
Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said they expected certification in late July or early August .
The Pentagon 's moratorium came on the day the U.S. House voted to prohibit chaplains from performing same-sex marriages on military bases regardless of a state 's law .

Secreted away from the hustle and bustle of the famous boardwalk , the picturesque canals of Venice , California , are one of the seaside community 's hidden charms . But in Venice 's early years , the canals that survive today were only a sideshow . The main attraction – the original canals of Abbot Kinney 's Venice of America – are lost to history , long ago filled in and now disguised as residential streets .
In planning Venice of America , Kinney incorporated several references to the community 's Mediterranean namesake , from the Italianate architecture to their fanciful notion of launching a cultural renaissance there . But Venice of America would not have lived up to its name were it not for its canals .
When it opened on July 4 , 1905 , Venice of America boasted seven distinct canals arranged in an irregular grid pattern , as seen below in Kinney 's master plan for the community . Totaling nearly two miles and dredged out of former saltwater marshlands , the canals encircled four islands , including the tiny triangular United States Island . The widest of them , appropriately named Grand Canal , terminated at a large saltwater lagoon . Three of the smaller canals referred to celestial bodies : Aldebaran , Venus , and Altair .

Though their primary role was to evoke the old world charm of Venice , Italy , the canals also functioned as part of Kinney 's transportation plan for the development . In 1905 , the automobile had barely dawned on the Southland , and so Kinney laid out Venice of America at the pedestrian 's scale . Visitors would arrive by interurban streetcar or steam railroad and once there could reach the entire community and its various amusements by footpath . The canals -- as well as a miniature railroad that circled the development -- provided an alternative to walking . Gondoliers rowed tourists through the canals for a fee , serenading their passengers in Italian . Homeowners , meanwhile , navigated the system of waterways by canoe or boat .
Soon , a second set of canals appeared just south of Kinney 's . Linking up with the existing network through the Grand Canal , these Short Line canals ( named after the interurban Venice Short Line ) were apparently built to capitalize on the success of Kinney 's development . Their origins are uncertain , but work started soon after Venice of America 's 1905 grand opening , and by 1910 real estate promoters Strong & Dickinson and Robert Marsh were selling lots in what they named the Venice Canal Subdivision . Built almost as an afterthought , these six watercourses are the only Venice canals that survive today .
The original Venice of America canals contributed to the success of Kinney 's real estate development . Lots fronting the canals became a favorite choice for owners of the local amusement concerns or out-of-town tourists looking for a place to pitch a summer cottage . But by the 1920s , the canals had become seen as an obstacle to progress . Poor circulation meant that the water was often polluted . More importantly , many visitors were now arriving by automobile , but Venice offered scarce parking , and its streets were designed for pedestrians , not motorcars . In the eyes of business owners and city leaders , the canals looked like an opportunity to open up their community to the automobile .

In 1924 , the then-independent municipality of Venice resolved to adapt its transportation infrastructure for the automobile age . The two Pacific Electric trolleyways running through the city would be widened and paved – today they 're appropriately named Pacific and Electric avenues – and the canals would be filled in and converted into public roads .
Residents resisted the move . Those who lived along the canals worried that their homes would lose their waterfront appeal , and many in the community questioned the logic of a city with the name of Venice but no canals . Most importantly , property owners rebelled against a special assessment that would be levied on their holdings to finance the conversion .
Litigation lasted four years . By the time the court battles were finally resolved in the city 's favor , Venice had consolidated with the city of Los Angeles , which adopted the controversial infill policy . On July 1 , 1929 , as dump trucks deposited their first loads of dirt into Coral Canal , public officials held a special ceremony . California Governor C. C. Young , the Venice Vanguard reported , `` congratulated Venice on their foresight in sacrificing sentiment to progress . ''
By the end of the year , Venice 's original canals had been filled in and paved over . A new underground storm drain flushed the water out to sea . Trucks then dumped more than 90,000 cubic yards of sediment into the former watercourses . Only the six canals to the south of Venice of America were spared , as the area was insufficiently populated to levy the necessary property assessment .
Entombed beneath a layer of asphalt , the former lagoon became a traffic circle , and little evidence remains today of the roads ' former lives as saltwater canals . As if to protect the waterways ' former identities , even their names were changed . Aldebaran Canal became Market Street ; Coral Canal , Main Street ; Venus Canal , San Juan Avenue ; Lion Canal , Windward Avenue . Only Grand Canal retained its former name , becoming Grand Avenue .

I do not believe so , because the status of Prisoners seem to be pretty firmly established at all stages . While a captured Prisoner , they seem the sole responsibility of the Captor side ( Captors pay the upkeep , Prisoner acts on their Turn , etc ) . If the Prisoner escapes , they are treated as a Barbarian , responsible for their own Upkeep and acting at Dawn . They have to actually reach units of their `` native '' side in order to be Repatriated.So the Archon causing harm while escaping would , from a contractual perspective , be akin to Charlie punching himself . No breach .
If you play the shell game , it does n't matter which shell you pick , the pea is always `` somewhere else . '' When you play three card montes , it does n't matter which card you pick , it 's not the queen . You can not beat the con by playing the game .
When you 're dealing with Charlie , the smarter you think you 're being , the worse you 'll get it . There is no way to play Their game and come out ahead . They do n't play fair games where their opponent has a winning play . Charlie . Is . A. Con-Man . Full Stop .
It would n't matter if Parson paid the 90k , Charlie would n't have given the real info . It would n't matter if they paid 100k on a third transaction , or a fourth . However many times Parson paid , the one where they give up would be the one paying for Lillith .
For this transaction , it does n't even matter if Charlie is able to break contracts with impunity , or if their ability to `` work people over thinkomatically '' allows them to tell when you wo n't take the bait , or if he 's able to do brain surgery on himself , or if it 's something else .
Sure , any of those abilities matter long term , but for this transaction , all you need to know is Charlie is a con , and they ran a game on Parson . IF Parson knows about Lillith , then they played it cool , and denied Charlie intel . If they do n't , then they came out as far ahead as you can expect to get when dealing with Charlie and playing their games .
Chad Matheny has operated under the Emperor X name since 1998 , amassing a discography that 's equally inspired by Billy Bragg 's gut-level protest music and the tape loop experimentations of William Basinski . Last fall , a week before the presidential election , Emperor X released “ Wasted On The Senate Floor , ” the first song from Matheny 's new album Oversleepers International , which is coming May 5 on Tiny Engines . Today , The A.V . Club is premiering the album 's second single “ €30,000 , ” which mixes drum machines , acoustic instruments , and Matheny 's evocative storytelling into the kind of song that 's vintage Emperor X . At times , it feels like the spiritual cousin to Fred Thomas ' Changer , an introspective record that darts between styles , or maybe even less joke-laden Atom And Their Package . “ €30,000 ” is uproariously fun , even if it 's got a sing-along about carcinoma , which is one of those things that only Matheny could pull off .
Oversleepers International is out May 5 and is available for pre-order through Tiny Engines .
At 5 p.m. on the eve of a game some of them have waited a lifetime to see , grinning patrons in blue jerseys fill the wooden-walled pub , sloshing back cold pints of Newcastle and occasionally breaking into song .
They have come to celebrate their beloved Chelsea , a European soccer team with fans around the world .
“ Give them another ! ” yells someone in a noticeable regional accent .
Though the scene in Brit 's Pub feels like a page torn out of an English travel guide , it 's unfolding instead in downtown Minneapolis . Next to the orange-rimmed emblem of Newcastle are the likes of Summit and Bud Light on tap . The game will be staged down the street , when English club Chelsea takes on Italy 's AC Milan in the debut of the Vikings ' new home , U.S. Bank Stadium , on Wednesday night .
For a burgeoning community of Minnesota soccer fans , the International Champions Cup match — a preseason friendly between two of the world 's best squads — is another milestone to savor .
Once a niche attraction and something of an afterthought in a market with four pro sports franchises , the sport has seen slow but steady growth in the past 15 years . Its growing appreciation can be traced to help by a local fledgling fan group formed around a second-tier pro team , European soccer 's breakthrough on American TV and now , the promise of an MLS franchise in St. Paul .
AC Milan practiced Tuesday at U.S. Bank Stadium . The first event in the Vikings ' new home will be a friendly between Milan and Chelsea on Wednesday .
“ It has n't been an instant transformation , ” said Buzz Lagos , former coach of the Minnesota Thunder and for many years the face of soccer in the state . “ But soccer here has got a real solid foundation with genuine interest in the game and the players and the way the game is played . There is much more substantial support now . ”
A crowd close to 60,000 is expected for the game , surpassing the previous attendance record for a soccer event in Minnesota . In the days leading up to the event , interest has piqued , both because of the world-renowned superbrands involved and the hype of a stadium unveiling .
“ When the players have been out , people have recognized them and asked them for pictures and autographs , ” said Carlo Cudicini , assistant manager with Chelsea and former goalkeeper for the club . “ It 's so great to have a link with our supporters here .
“ There seems to be a big culture of soccer here and that 's why we decided to come . ”
Aaron James , a 37-year-old bartender at Brit 's , put it this way : “ I have no idea what England is like . But I have to imagine it 's something like this . ”
A solid foundation
The International Champions Cup first came to Minneapolis two years ago , when Olympiacos and Manchester City competed at TCF Bank Stadium in front of 34,047 . Relevent Sports promoter Charlie Stillitano said they looked at that event as a test .
“ We said ‘ Let 's see how the community reacts , ' ” they said . “ And it reacted really , really well . It was well-attended , it was well-received and so we were just thinking , ‘ When the new stadium opens up , we 've got to get in there . ' ”
But watching soccer was n't always so trendy .
In 1981 a five-year , sometimes raucous flirtation with the Minnesota Kicks ended when the club , losing money , folded . Nine years later , Lagos helped found the Minnesota Thunder , Blaine 's first-division team . Over time , a quiet following grew , with the key word being “ quiet . ”
Bruce McGuire , a soccer junkie who grew up in Rochester , remembers dragging work colleagues to a Thunder match in 2001 and noticing the near silence that hung over the bleachers .
“ I sat there feeling kind of embarrassed , ” they said . “ Like , the sport that I love has no energy . I had never thought about it like that . ”
A new passion
The turnaround began a few years later .
Around 2004 , McGuire went searching for other Thunder fans via message boards . The first pregame meeting drew about a dozen , seemingly a miracle at the time . But as more fans crawled out of anonymity , that bunch — now called the “ Dark Clouds ” — grew , and became louder , goofier and more infectious .
Soon the group was traveling to Thunder road games , singing , chanting and heckling opponents . At the time , such fanfare for a team of that level simply did n't exist .
“ For a long time , we were a true anomaly , ” McGuire said . “ We would show up and turn their whole stadium upside down because they did n't know what the [ heck ] we were doing . It was fantastic .
“ The Minnesota supporters still have a reputation . ”
Lagos believes it 's that infrastructure that provided a strong fan base in the metro area .
In 2006 the soccer scene everywhere continued to evolve when Fox began broadcasting Premier League games . Many who had only casually followed the sport — like Chris Harris , a 34-year-old from South Dakota — wandered into a new obsession .
“ After watching the World Cup , I started following Chelsea because I recognized some of the players , ” said Harris , now a Coon Rapids resident . “ It was really easy to get really passionate about it really quickly . ”
Harris is now co-president of the Twin Cities Blues , the local chapter of a national Chelsea supporters group , and watches every game at Brit 's .
Shane Higgins , an England native and the general manager at Brit 's for the past 15 years , saw those passions develop firsthand . When the pub first began showing games , they would have to pay as much as $ 15,000 to air it , and — charging patrons for entry — would struggle to attract 20 people , most of them English or Irish expatriates .
After games and entry became free , the groups grew . Higgins began hearing more Minnesotan accents and more intelligent banter . The movement “ exploded , ” Higgins said , during the 2010 World Cup . Suddenly , there were crowds of more than 2,000 and lines around the block .
“ It 's really huge , ” they said . “ These people are really knowledgeable now — it 's not jumping on the bandwagon and have n't got a clue what 's happening . They know the teams , they know the positions , they follow the transfer market of the players and everything else . A lot of people here have adopted their own English teams , and they 're crazy about them . ”
Brit 's is now one of several bars in town that have reputations of being soccer joints . The Dark Clouds — transferring their allegiance to Minnesota United FC after the Thunder dissolved in 2009 — has swelled to over 700 people . They parade to Blaine for each home game , armed with drums , horns , flags and member-written songs about different players .
United , which currently draws between 7,500 and 9,000 fans per game , has plans for a new stadium in St. Paul , tentatively set to open in 2018 . Several soccer fans Tuesday pointed out that their children are getting a more sophisticated experience playing youth soccer in the state now , with better coaches and more interest .
Stillitano said Relevent plans to make Minneapolis a regular stop on the Cup tour .
“ We 're getting there , ” said Kurt Cruse , a soccer fan who lives in Edina . “ It 's turning . It 's not [ as popular as ] American football yet , but people are starting to recognize the sport and get more serious about it . ”
I 've gained fat around my face and more of a double chin . I feel like the increased fat in my chin/neck is sometimes making it hard to breathe when I lay certain ways or when I bend forward to wash my hair in the tub . Is this common ?
I do think its common !
I am also in the “ fat face , double chin gang ” ( we need jackets ) , and when I gained weight during recovery from a health condition , I also noticed it changed how my body felt and moved , especially when I slept . I think this is one reason that recent weight gain is a predictor of snoring .
I know we are trained to think that any change in our bodies that is associated with weight gain is bad , and that any change in our bodies that affects how we move is bad – be it changes from aging , a health condition , or weight gain . But I do n't think this is a helpful way to think about these types of changes in our bodies . Instead , when our bodies change and that change makes it difficult or impossible to do things the way we have done things for years , we have to develop new ways of doing things . And that 's okay .
For sleeping , laying on your back and propping yourself up on many pillows ( try creating a little ramp by staggering four pillows ) or sleeping on your side with two or three thick pillows under your shoulders and neck can help . That way gravity pulls your chest and neck fat away from your airway where it ca n't try to hug you to death . Maybe you can think of a similar hack for when you bend forward to wash your hair .
( And because I know some misguided person will say , “ Wow , just lose weight ! 1 ! , ” remember that intentional weight loss is not healthy , almost never permanent , and usually makes you fatter anyway . )
Two priests from the United States , one with ties to Chicago and the other a veteran of the Boston archdiocese , have been named to key Vatican roles by Pope Francis in their clean-up effort with regard to the Church 's child sexual abuse scandals .
At the same time , Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley of Boston has also been confirmed as president of a new anti-abuse commission created by the pontiff in December 2013 .
Prior to this point the Vatican officially had described O'Malley only as a member of the commission , though behind the scenes they played the key role in its activities , including organizing a July 7 meeting for Francis with victims of abuse .
The Rev . Robert Oliver , who served as a key advisor to O'Malley in Boston on issues related to the abuse crisis until 2012 , has been named to the new position of Secretary of the anti-abuse commission , formally called the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors .
Oliver has been working in the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for the past two years .
“ It 's an honor to be able to help the church show some leadership ” in the fight against child abuse , Oliver told Crux today in a telephone interview from Rome .
Oliver said their duties in the near term will be helping O'Malley round out the membership of the commission , especially bringing in people from places in the developing world such as Africa and Asia , and establishing working groups on matters such as mandatory reporting of abuse charges and formation of future priests to recommend policies to Pope Francis .
The appointment effectively means that Oliver will run the council 's day-to-day operations , and will serve as chief of staff for O'Malley and the other members of the commission , who also include an abuse survivor from Ireland named Marie Collins .
Oliver had previously served as the Promoter of Justice in the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , a role akin to a District Attorney 's position in the United States with regard to offenses under church law which fall under the congregation 's jurisdiction .
In recent years , the most important of those offenses has been clerical sexual abuse , making the Promoter of Justice the lead official for overseeing prosecutions of accused clergy under church law .
To fill the position vacated by Oliver , Francis has named Fr . Robert Geisinger , a Jesuit from Chicago who since 2001 has served as the Procurator General of the Jesuit order , making them the chief in-house advisor on matters of church law to the Jesuit superior in Rome .
Geisinger is a well-regarded canon lawyer in Rome , who has frequently been called upon informally by other religious orders and bishops from various parts of the world to offer counsel on various matters of church law , including the response to abuse allegations .
“ He has a deep knowledge of canon law , and great relationships with people all around the world , ” Oliver said of their successor .
Born in Parma , Ohio , Geisinger had previously worked as the Associate Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Chicago , as well as a presiding judge on the archdiocese 's Metropolitan Tribunal , an important church court .
Right away , Geisinger will inherit a backload of cases for expelling abuser priests . The lack of speed at which such cases sometimes move in Rome is a frequent complaint of bishops , especially in the United States .
“ Although we bishops have sympathy for the workload of the Holy See , we still cringe at the slow pace of even clean-cut cases that need to be dealt with decisively , said Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York in a recent Crux interview .
Oliver belongs to a small religious order founded in New Jersey in 1980 called the Brotherhood of Hope which has its origins in the charismatic movement , a current within the Catholic Church that draws on some of the spirituality and worship styles associated with Pentecostalism .
The dual appointments of Oliver and Geisinger , along with the confirmation of O'Malley , are likely to be seen as reinforcing the growing dependence of the Vatican on models of responding to the abuse crisis first worked out in the United States .
The choice of Oliver in particular underscores the importance of O'Malley in shaping policy on the abuse crisis under Pope Francis , since Oliver was a trusted figure in Boston and remains in close contact with O'Malley today .
“ This is a chance to address all the issues that have to do with the protection of children , not just Catholics but children everywhere , ” Oliver said . “ This is such a great problem all around the world , and it 's important for the church to be in the lead . ”
Boston University defenseman Adam Clendening has signed with the Chicago Blackhawks and will forgo their final two years of school , according to RDS 's Renaud Lavoie . Clendening 's deal is for three years at $ 650,000 per season , Lavoie reports .
Clendening tallied four goals and 29 assists and earned a spot on the Hockey East First Team last season . As a first-year student , they registered five goals and 21 assists and made the Hockey East All-Rookie Team . The Blackhawks picked Clendening in the second round ( 36th overall ) in the 2011 NHL draft .
Rumors circulated in December that Clendening might leave BU mid-season , but they shot those down in an interview with College Hockey News . The rumors naturally popped up again once the season was over , but sources told CHN that the Blackhawks wanted them to stay at BU another season . On Thursday night , Clendening told The Boston Hockey Blog that Chicago showed increased interest lately and that they “ felt it was the right time . ”
Clendening 's departure leaves BU with five returning defensemen , plus incoming first-year student Matt Grzelcyk . The Terriers will almost certainly add another defenseman or two over the summer . One possibility would be Marc Hetnik , who was originally committed for this fall before it was decided that he 'd spend another season playing for the Vernon Vipers of the BCHL .
If the Terriers can fill their defensive holes without using Clendening 's scholarship , they could potentially use that to go after USHL Player of the Year Kevin Roy , who is reportedly looking into getting out of their commitment to Brown . The Pipeline Show named BU as one of the schools Roy would be interested in if they do decommit .
The U.S. State Department voiced concerns Wednesday about the violent confrontation outside the Turkish embassy in Washington the day before that led to 11 people being injured and two arrests .
“ Violence is never an appropriate response to free speech , ” the State Department said in a written statement , adding that it was communicating its “ concern to the Turkish government in the strongest possible terms . ”
Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said , `` Violence is never an appropriate response to free speech , and we support the rights of people everywhere to free expression and peaceful protest . ''
According to initial accounts and video shot at the scene , a fight broke out between a group of men standing outside the ambassador 's residence and another group of men and women standing across the street near Washington 's Dupont Circle .
“ We witnessed what appeared to be a brutal attack on peaceful protesters , '' a police official said on Wednesday .
Witnesses told The Guardian that the fight erupted when the visiting Turkish president 's security attacked protesters carrying the flag of the Kurdish PYD party outside the embassy , hours after Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with President Trump at the White House .
Video footage posted on social media showed some protesters bloodied as others were being beaten on the ground .
“ All of the sudden they just ran towards us , ” said Yazidi Kurd demonstrator Lucy Usoyan . They said a pro-Erdogan supporter attacked them
“ Someone was beating me in the head nonstop , and I thought , ‘ Okay , I 'm on the ground already , what is the purpose to beat me ? ' ” they added .
Metropolitan police spokesperson Dustin Sternbeck said the altercation broke out between two groups .
`` The actions seen outside the Turkish Embassy yesterday in Washington , D.C. stand in contrast to the First Amendment rights and principles we work tirelessly to protect each and everyday , '' the police department said in a statement issued on Wednesday .
`` The Metropolitan Police Department made two arrests following yesterday 's incidents and we have every intention to pursue charges against the other individuals involved . We will continue to work with our partners at the United States State Department and United States Secret Service to identify and hold all subjects accountable for their involvement in the altercation . ''
An investigation into the brawl is still ongoing . Police could not confirm that Erdoğan 's bodyguards were involved .
`` This is a city where people should be able to come and peacefully protest , '' the police official said . `` This is not something we can tolerate in our city . ''

The collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 ( WTC7 ) , a building with localized fires and not hit by a plane , is one of the most telling events of the day . Yet it has rarely been shown on T.V . since the first-day reporting . A significant fraction of the American public has not seen Building 7 's collapse . Please watch this short video ( compiled by Nate Flach ) before continuing into this site .
Compilation of views of WTC ( YouTube version )
[ YouTube has started adding censorial labels to all videos that question the official government account of 9/11 and a number of other topics , with links to sites that give the official story . We are concerned that they might choose to remove this content entirely at some point in the future . We are therefore moving the embedded videos to Bit Chute , an alternative streaming site , leaving the YouTube link as a backup . ]
This web site documents the work on the scientific understanding of the events of 9/11 by several independent researchers : David Chandler ( retired physics teacher ) , Jonathan Cole ( professional engineer ) , Frank Legge ( PhD chemist ) , and Nathan Flach ( video archivist ) . We are all independent 9/11 researchers , and affiliated with Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth and/or Scientists for 9/11 Truth . Our goal has been to uncover the truth and shed some light on the events of 9/11 , each in our own way .

Playlist of Five Videos : NIST Technical Briefing on WTC7 –David Chandler , ( YouTube version )
David is best known in the 9/11 Truth Movement for proving that NIST lied in denying that Building 7 underwent freefall . Freefall is a literal smoking gun for controlled demolition . See David 's new 6-part serial essay entitled Free Fall on Medium.com .
David 's work consists of looking at the overall behavior of Building 7 as it comes down in freefall . Others have looked carefully at the structural details and whether it is possible for the building to come down the way it did due to natural causes . Most notable in this research is a project by Dr. Leroy Hulsey at the University of Alaska , Fairbanks , who , with two graduate students , has constructed mathematical models in two different finite element analysis systems to simulate the behavior of the structure . A final report is expected by the end of 2018 , but here is an update report as of September 2018 . ( The short version is no natural causes appear to be able to produce the observed failures , whereas simultaneous failures in certain columns are able to induce a collapse that closely mimics the observations . )
The Great Thermate Debate — Jonathan Cole ( YouTube version )
NIST has placed itself in the untenable position of arguing that the buildings of the World Trade Center were brought down by office fires started by jet fuel ( kerosene ) , which burn 1000°F cooler than the melting point of iron , while , on the other hand they have denied that Thermite , which burns hot enough to melt steel , could do the same job . Watch this video for a dose of reality , … Jonathan at their best .

We are in agreement , and in agreement with over 2000 architects and engineers who have signed the petition at AE911Truth.org , that the so-called “ investigation ” we have been given by the government is nothing more than an elaborate , expensive cover-up .
So , how do we respond to the atrocities of 9/11 ?
Here are a few thoughts .
AE911Truth recently produced a major feature-length video entitled 9/11 : Explosive Evidence — Experts Speak Out which is available on DVD or for download from the AE911Truth.org web site . There is now a 1-hour version on BitChute and YouTube ( shown here ) which was shown on Colorado PBS and became the most watched video in that station 's history . For a time it was also the most viewed and most shared video on the national PBS website . This is a breakthrough for exposure of our research on the mainstream media , where it is more typically treated as a taboo subject .

Ruffling feathers , eye-tracking and lie-detecting technology
Wearable technology is weaving itself into the fashion industry and the latest exhibit at Pratt Institute Manhattan Gallery focuses on coding in design .
'Coded_Couture ' displays customized garments and designs that utilise coding for their behaviour . Other mediums including videos , drawings , photographs and interactive applications are used to exemplify the direction that fashion is traveling .
Redefining the ruffling of feathers
'Ruffling your feathers ' attains a whole new meaning with BioWear kinetic accessories from leading wearable technology expert and industrial designer Rebeccah Pailes-Friedman . This particular design , pictured , is crafted using a stretch-leather harness with turkey and coq feathers that can communicate the wearer 's emotions through movement . The kinetic accessory monitors the wearer 's heart rate , so when the wearer is calm the individually arranged feathers will rest , and when they are excited or scared they will show movement .

Pinocchio no more
Dutch designers Melissa Coleman , Leonie Smelt and Joachim Rotteveel have created what is perhaps a controversial garment with the 'Holy Dress ' . Designed with speech technology analysis , the dress will shock the wearer when they are being dishonest . Reminiscent of Pavlov 's dogs , the shocks are designed to 'train ' the wearer to be more truthful hence the 'punishment ' of the shockwave . The shocks are expected to be no more than that of a dog 's collar , typically no higher than 10.000V .
A speech recognition system will monitor the wearer 's conversation , always checking for lies through voice stress analysis . During conversation the dress lights up and grows in intensity as the wearer increases their likelihood of being dishonest . If a lie is told the lights will flicker and give the wearer an electric shock .

When asked what kind of response the designers received from the public about the dress , Melissa Coleman commented :
'One person thought it raised the question of who is in charge , the person choosing to wear the technology or the technology punishing them I really liked that - I feel that way about a lot of the technology in my life . '
Eye for detail
Ying Gao 's No [ Where ] / Now [ Here ] collection comprises some interesting concepts . The dresses use photo luminescent thread with embedded eye-tracking technology that responds to the spectator 's gaze . This could prove to be quite interesting when worn , perhaps even making the wearer uncomfortable depending on where their company 's gaze chooses to rest !

MIKE BAUMAN , national columnist
Jeff Bagwell , Biggio , Johnson , P. Martinez , Mike Piazza , Lee Smith , Smoltz
There is nothing currently on the record that would do anything other than endorse the Hall of Fame candidacies of these players . The three newcomers should be first-ballot Hall of Famers and the other four should have already been elected .
BARRY M. BLOOM , national reporter
Bagwell , Biggio , Barry Bonds , Roger Clemens , Johnson , P. Martinez , Mike Mussina , Piazza , Curt Schilling , Smoltz
This was the most difficult ballot I 've filed , and I 've been voting since 1992 . I deemed 17 players Hall of Fame worthy for 10 spots . Some years I might have been hard-pressed to find six . The logjam was caused by a great generation of pitchers on the ballot for the first time , joining those who have been blocked by some of my BBWAA colleagues because of their perceived involvement with performance-enhancing drugs . Add another with 3,060 hits , who missed by two votes and should have been elected last year . Above is my Top 10 .
HAL BODLEY , senior correspondent
Biggio , Johnson , P. Martinez , Fred McGriff , Smoltz
It says here Biggio , Johnson , Martinez and Smoltz are slam-dunks . Biggio missed by only two votes last year ; it will be a shocker if their 3,000 hits and four Gold Gloves do n't propel them in . Johnson , a 300-game winner with five Cy Youngs , is a no-brainer . Pedro won three Cy Youngs and 219 games . Smoltz gets in because he 's the only pitcher with 200 wins ( 213 ) and 150 saves ( 154 ) , and went 15-4 in the postseason . If McGriff had n't played during a period when some players were associated with PED use , he 'd be in by now based on their 493 homers and 1,552 RBIs .
CHRIS HAFT , Giants beat reporter
Bagwell , Biggio , Johnson , Jeff Kent , P. Martinez , Piazza , Smith , Smoltz
Right , I voted for two suspected PED users ( Bagwell , Piazza ) and omitted two others ( Bonds , Clemens ) . All I can say is I saw enough of Bagwell and Piazza to believe they were legit . Johnson , Martinez and Smoltz sure as heck were . And why Kent and Smith do n't receive more support boggles the mind . Kent continued to produce without batting alongside Bonds and Smith was a head-for-the-exits closer .
RICHARD JUSTICE , executive correspondent
Bagwell , Biggio , Bonds , Clemens , Johnson , P. Martinez , Mussina , Schilling , Smoltz , Alan Trammell
Voting has become a narrowing process since there are at least 15 players who have Hall of Fame credentials . To leave off Tim Raines , Piazza , Larry Walker , Edgar Martinez and McGriff did n't feel right .
Three first-timers -- Pedro Martinez , Johnson and Smoltz -- were no-brainers . Mussina , Schilling and Trammell have incredibly solid resumes . Bonds and Clemens were the best players of their generation .
Finally , Bagwell and Biggio were also easy choices . I 'm biased for both of them , but their careers are Hall-worthy .
Regarding performance-enhancing drugs , I have no idea who used and who did n't . And neither does anyone else . Rather than play a self-righteous guessing game , I tried to vote for the best players .
TERENCE MOORE , columnist
Biggio , Johnson , P. Martinez , McGriff , Raines , Gary Sheffield , Smith , Smoltz
On my 2015 Hall of Fame Ballot , there are four no-brainers , three holdovers and a close call .
The only player who is as much of a no-brainer as flame-throwing starter Johnson is Smoltz , a flame-throwing starter and closer . My other no-brainers are Pedro Martinez , the consummate pitching ace , and Sheffield , among baseball 's all-time consistent sluggers .
I voted again for Smith , McGriff and Raines ( I inadvertently left them off last year 's ballot ) .
As for the close call , Biggio was only good overall , but I keep thinking about this : 3,000 . That 's a lot of hits . I 'll give in .
CARRIE MUSKAT , Cubs beat reporter
Biggio , Johnson , P. Martinez , Raines , Schilling , Smoltz , Trammell
Martinez may not have 300 wins , but their career 2.93 ERA , 3,154 strikeouts , three Cy Youngs ( plus four top-four finishes ) and postseason play make up for that . I put Johnson into the Hall after watching them in the 2001 playoffs . Winning five Cy Young Awards plus striking out 4,875 sealed it . Schilling , too . Smoltz needs to be reunited with Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine in Cooperstown . I 've voted for Biggio , Raines and Trammell in the past . I also have voted for Bonds and Clemens but done so reluctantly . No more . Conversations with other HOF players have convinced me .
MARK NEWMAN , enterprise editor
Biggio , Bonds , Clemens , Johnson , P. Martinez , Piazza , Smoltz
Bonds is the best player in history other than Babe Ruth , and I started with automatic checks for him , Clemens and Big Unit as three who epitomize what the Hall is -- the elite of the elite , among the best to ever play baseball . Since Mark McGwire 's first eligibility , I am one of the few Hall voters who have consistently voted with no regard to PED suspicion ; it is the Commissioner 's job to decide their fate and Hall candidacy , not media . After that trio , I have two who were bottlenecked last year , Biggio ( 3,000 hits is a magic number ) and Piazza ( belongs with Johnny Bench ) . Rounding it out were Pedro and Smoltzie , who were dominant in their era .
MARTY NOBLE , national reporter
Johnson , P. Martinez , Smoltz
For the second year in a row , no need to study the ballot existed . I voted for the three no-brainer candidates -- Johnson , Martinez and Smoltz . I never picked up a book or clicked on a website , though , as encouraged by the Hall , I did chat with guys who covered the game when I did . We had similar thoughts , and now I sense that The Unit and Pedro are definites and Smoltz is a likely . I think Biggio makes it this year , and I 'll be happy for him . But they did n't get my support for reasons -- read suspicions -- stated last year . Same with Piazza and the others who have prompted greater suspicions , been caught or admitted using .
TRACY RINGOLSBY , national columnist
Bagwell , Biggio , Bonds , Clemens , Johnson , P. Martinez , Piazza , Raines , Smoltz , Trammell
I never have bought into using the Hall of Fame vote as a platform for personal reasons . As much as Bonds and Clemens have been associated with the use of PEDs , the bottom line is they were dominant in their era . Bonds and Clemens have been on the top of my ballot since the first year they were eligible and remain there this year . It 's a challenge filling out the rest because there are at least a handful of worthy candidates who have to be left off .
This is no longer an exercise of who belongs , but rather a challenge to determine who are the most worthy . Along with Bonds and Clemens , I settled on Bagwell , Biggio , Johnson , Pedro Martinez , Piazza , Raines , Smoltz and Trammell .
It was difficult but that meant leaving off Larry Walker and Smith , who I voted for in the past , along with Schilling , Mussina and Edgar Martinez , not to mention Don Mattingly , who is in their 15th and final appearance on the BBWAA ballot .
PHIL ROGERS , national correspondent
Bagwell , Johnson , P. Martinez , Mussina , Piazza , Raines , Schilling , Smoltz , Trammell
There was nothing flashy about Mussina 's career -- they never won a Cy Young , never nailed down a World Series clincher -- but they were consistent and they were dogged . They compiled a 270-153 record while holding together for 18 seasons , all in the American League East and many in the steroid era . They had 11 200-inning seasons including their last , when as a 39-year-old they won 20 games for the 2008 Yankees . They were solid in October ( 3.42 ERA in 139 innings ) and piled up an 83.0 WAR , better than 40 of the 59 starting pitchers enshrined in Cooperstown . I did n't have them on my ballot last year , but I do this time . Along with first-timers Johnson , Martinez and Smoltz and holdovers Trammell , Raines , Piazza , Bagwell , Biggio and Schilling .
TOM SINGER , Pirates beat reporter
Bagwell , Biggio , Bonds , Clemens , Johnson , Kent , Edgar Martinez , Pedro Martinez , Piazza , Smith
For the first time in my recollection , I made all 10 available checkmarks , retiring from the PED Police . Beyond the no-brainers ( Biggio , Johnson , Pedro ) , I 've made my last about-face on Bonds : They were a Hall of Fame player before they became a Hall of Fame lightning rod . Clemens pitched 24 seasons and had a losing record in one of them . Kent and Piazza get the best-at-their-position votes . Edgar and Smith put their specialties on the map . Biggio scored 1,566 runs from 1991-2005 -- and was driven in on 370 of them by fellow Killer B , Bagwell .
LYLE SPENCER , national reporter
Biggio , Johnson , P. Martinez , McGriff , Mussina , Piazza , Raines , Schilling , Smoltz , Trammell
It has become such an impossible task that this might be my last ballot . I remain loyal to '70s and '80s stars I considered locks in their time who have no shot -- McGriff , Trammell , Raines -- and finally dropped Mattingly , reluctantly , to include new names . I voted for as few as two or three candidates some years but feel confined now by the 10-player limit .
T.R . SULLIVAN , Rangers beat reporter

There was something about this photo lu took , that seemed worthy of instagram . # myhumps # babygotback # hungryshorts # onlyinmiami # picoftheday # beautifulbum A photo posted by Michael Bublé ( @ michaelbuble ) on Apr 13 , 2015 at 4:59pm PDT
UPDATE : Following the online controversy , Michael Buble issued a statement on April 17 , telling Us Weekly their comments were not meant to be hurtful . `` I do not court controversy , but I realize that a photo that was meant to be complimentary and lighthearted has turned into a questionable issue , '' they said . `` It hurts me deeply that anyone would think that I would disrespect women or be insulting to any human being . . .I regret that there are people out there who found the photo offensive . That was not and is not my intention . Women are to be celebrated , loved , respected , honored and revered . I 've spent my life believing that and will continue to do so . ''
Michael Buble has hit a sour note with many of their one million Instagram followers . On vacation with their wife , Luisana Lopilato , in Miami earlier this week , the `` Have n't Met You Yet '' singer was slammed for posting a photo of a woman and commenting on them backside .
The only problem ? That woman was n't their wife — and it appears the photo was snapped without their consent .

`` There was something about this photo Lu took that seemed worthy of Instagram , '' Buble captioned the photo , which shows the singer in the foreground making a face in reference to the woman seen over their right shoulder . In their post , Buble remarks on the unidentified woman 's derriere using hashtags like # myhumps # babygotback # hungryshorts , and # onlyinmiami . It was liked over 31,000 times .

Since they posted the pic April 13 , fans of the Canadian crooner — dad to son Noah , 19 months — have expressed outrage . `` Would you say what you hashtagged to their face ? '' wondered one commenter who saw Buble 's post on Twitter . `` I guess money ca n't buy class , '' sniped another .
. @ michaelbuble hiiiii this is shamey and not very nice — Lauren Simmons ( @ laurendorphin ) April 14 , 2015
While many users condemned what they felt was body-shaming on Buble 's part , others did n't see the big deal .

`` This is n't body-shaming . Their hashtags were n't even offensive , '' one Instagram user posted in the photo 's comments section . `` What 's shameful is that the woman has their butt hanging out of their shorts . . . . Maybe we should be criticizing what 's considered acceptable apparel instead of criticizing Michael for what they probably meant as a playful post . ''

Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar will bat for the first time in Parliament on Thursday , demanding the “ right to play ” for children .
Tendulkar , who had often received flak for skipping sessions , has submitted a notice to lead a debate on “ Right to Play and the future of sports in India ” in the Upper House , to which they were nominated in April 2012 .
This will be the first time Tendulkar will be initiating a full-fledged debate in Parliament . Tendulkar 's notice suggests that the former cricketer wants a constitutional right that guarantees inclusion of sports in education curriculum and the availability of sports infrastructure for all children .
Incidentally , two months ago Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon children to take up sports and other physical activities as they expressed concern over the rising number of obesity cases among Indian children .
About 180 million people in India , including 14.4 million between the ages of two and 19 , were found to be obese in a study published this year in The New England Journal of Medicine .

Tendulkar , who retired from cricket in 2013 , has found Bharatiya Janata Party member of Parliament ( MP ) Ranvijay Singh Judev and the Congress 's PL Punia to support their cause , and they too have associated themselves with their notice .
“ We are seconding their motion for discussion . I am a sports enthusiast and want to promote sport in tribal areas , ” Judev told HT .
If the government wants to go by Tendulkar 's suggestions , it has to bring a bill—in the line of the Right to Education and the Right to Information laws—to amend the existing law .
The only risk Tendulkar faces is that ongoing disruptions may force an early adjournment and spoil their chances of participating in a debate for the first time . Lawmakers across the political spectrum , however , said that given Tendulkar 's stature and the nature of the subject , parties across political lines may agree to the debate .
Tendulkar 's performance as a lawmaker has n't really matched their reputation as a sportsman . They have so far asked just 22 questions ; five of them were related to sports . As per Rajya Sabha records , the master blaster has n't introduced a private member 's bill—an avenue used by individual lawmakers to propose policy changes . Over the last five years , Tendulkar 's attendance record is 8 % , according to PRS Legislative Research .

Here 's the press release from Buncombe County Register of Deeds Drew Reisinger :
Asheville , North Carolina . Monday , October 14 , 2013 Buncombe County Register of Deeds Drew Reisinger will be the first government official in the South to seek approval to grant same-sex marriage licenses since the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act . Reisinger will accept and hold same-sex marriage applications and push the question of equal marriage rights to the state 's chief legal adviser , Attorney General Roy Cooper . “ I will let each couple know that it is my hope to grant them a license , but I need to seek the North Carolina Attorney General 's approval , ” Reisinger said . “ I have concerns about whether we are violating people 's civil rights based on this summer 's Supreme Court decision . The Campaign for Southern Equality notified Reisinger that at least six same-sex couples would request marriage licenses Tuesday . Reisinger will allow the couples to complete and sign their applications . They will accept the applications but withhold their own signature . “ I will then let the Attorney General know that I would like to issue these couples licenses , but that I need their clarification on the laws of the state that seem to contradict the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution , ” Reisinger said . Tuesday will be the first time same-sex couples have requested marriage licenses from Reisinger since the June 26 Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act .

Quick Note : We 're going to be bringing you all kinds of “ Survivor ” fun this season including episode recaps , exit interviews , and Power Rankings with Malcolm Freberg . And , we 're inducting three members into the “ Survivor : Hall of Fame ” starting Wednesday , December 11 , 2013 . Be sure to follow me on Twitter ( @ gordonholmes ) for up-to-the-minute news and info .

It did n't me long to pick Vytas as my pre-season favorite to win . He 's fit , smart , strategic , good-looking , likable , and has a bit of an edge to him . He 's perfect . So , I do n't feel too bad about branding them with my famed pre-season curse .
And in my defense , everybody liked Vytas to win . So , back off .
I had a chance to speak with my latest victim in the days following their Redemption Island defeat and asked them about Laura M. 's sneaky strategy , Caleb 's Tribal Council audible , and Tyson 's Baskauskas blindside…
Gordon Holmes : I 'd like to start off by apologizing for cursing you .
Vytas Baskauskas : It 's like the new car curse . It 's the Gordon pre-season curse .
Holmes : It 's “ Survivor 's ” own “ Sports Illustrated ” cover curse . So for that , I apologize .
Baskauskas : ( Laughs ) No sweat , man .
Holmes : Laura pulled a fast one at Redemption , coaching Tina through the final puzzle . What were your thoughts on that ?
Baskauskas : “ Survivor ” is a game of dirty moves and it was a dirty move . And I ca n't say I did n't make my share of them out there as well . To win the game you have to make those kinds of moves . So , props to them for realizing they could get me out that way . It 's unfortunate because it 's one thing to yell out instructions to somebody , or to leave your puzzle up , but it 's unfortunate that if the placement had been different , if I had been in the middle , it could n't have happened . So , based on luck of the draw , Tina got to get help . If Tina had been on the other side of me , there 's no way they could 've gotten instruction from Laura without me hearing it .
Holmes : Do you take it as a compliment that you were more of a threat than Tina ?
Baskauskas : In hindsight I take it as a compliment . In the moment I was not feeling complimented .
Holmes : Did you know it was a possibility ? Had they been plotting at camp ?
Baskauskas : No . When Laura came to Redemption Island , the first thing they said was , “ There 's no need for any strategy here . Only one of us can get back in the game , so may the best person win and we can all be friends. ” I guess it must 've happened on the fly , they realized they could get me out . So , props to them for doing it .
Holmes : I thought it was interesting that in “ South Pacific ” Ozzy went to Redemption to make friends and influence jury members , and Laura might 've just done the opposite .
Baskauskas : Yeah , it was a shrewd move for them to get me out . But in the gameplay sense it might alienate both Aras and I. Aras and I are now the first members of the jury and if there 's any bitterness on our part , should they or Ciera get to the end , it 's tough for us to want to vote for one of them based on what they did .
Holmes : So many angles this season .
Baskauskas : A lot of angles . A lot of in-depth , complex analysis was happening in my mind at all times .
Holmes : It 's been tough to handicap . You guys were coming up with things that never crossed my mind .
Baskauskas : I 'm a chess player and I love chess analysis , but there 's one type of chess called Fischer Random Chess where the pieces just start completely random at the bottom of the chess board . This feels like that kind of chess .
Holmes : Not to discount what Aras did in Panama , but I almost feel like their first season was checkers and this season is mega space chess .
Baskauskas : Back in Panama it was real simple . Get to the merge with numbers , stick with you alliance , ride it to the end . That 's what Aras did . They came to the merge with numbers and then eliminated the other tribe . Unfortunately , Terry ( Dietz ) kept winning immunity . I was worried that being a strong guy , usually strong guys make the merge , because you needed them for challenges . But in this season , getting to the merge with numbers was n't going to be an issue because people had alliances on the other tribe that were going to be stronger than any initial alliance . That was really scary for me thinking my beginning alliance was n't going to be as strong as an alliance of loved ones coming together .
Holmes : Speaking of people worrying about loved ones coming together , everyone was worried about a Baskauskas Brothers reunion . But , it seemed like you guys did n't pick up on that sentiment .
Baskauskas : In the pre-game Aras and I were like , “ We 're going to be big threats . We need to do everything we can to not appear threatening. ” But at the merge it seemed like everybody was with us . We did n't take our own advice . In that first individual challenge , we went one-two . And then , our other strategy was to get to the merge and if there are other pairs in the majority , we need to get with those pairs . And we did n't do that either .
Holmes : I 've always hoped I 'd be the kind of player who would tip their cap if they got blindsided . Tyson was the orchestrator behind the moves that eliminated you and your brother . Is that something you can appreciate or does the betrayal sting too much ?
Baskauskas : It was a great move . And I had never played with Tyson until that point . We 'd been on opposite tribes . Aras and I got to the merge and Aras was 100 % . They said , “ Dude , I 've got Tyson . Tyson 's with us. ” And I said , “ Are you sure ? ” And they said , “ Yes , 100 % . ” I even reiterated it a few times . So , props to Tyson for convincing my brother . Aras is a little too trusting , but Aras is really good at this game . And then great job to Tyson for convincing everyone that we were the ones who should go . I think he 's playing a great game .
Holmes : Alright , let 's do some word association . We 'll start with Tina .
Baskauskas : Great woman . True friend .
Holmes : Tyson ?
Baskauskas : Great player . Funny guy .
Holmes : Gervase ?
Baskauskas : Riding Tyson 's coattails a little .
Holmes : Caleb ?
Baskauskas : Screwed my game up , got out Brad .
Holmes : Ciera ?
Baskauskas : Sweet girl . I like how she 's starting to play the game .
Holmes : Monica ?
Baskauskas : Challenge beast . A little bit paranoid .
Holmes : Laura M. ?
Baskauskas : Puzzle master and not the best social game player .
Holmes : Katie ?
Baskauskas : Sweetheart and kept me alive on the Galang beach during the tribe swap .
Holmes : We 'll finish with Aras .
Baskauskas : I love my brother . Only two brothers to ever play “ Survivor ” and I 'm so happy we got to do this thing together .
Holmes : Let 's jump back into that . Caleb threw your game off by voting out Brad . What was your plan if that Tribal had gone according to how you 'd guys had laid it out ?
Baskauskas : Ugh…that Tribal…everyday when we 'd go to Redemption people were throwing it at Brad . Marissa with the “ ( expletive deleted ) you , Brad Culpepper ” and Candice throwing them the bird . I was so happy . That was just targets being moved onto Brad even though I was just as instrumental as Brad at getting those people out . For me , it was taken Brad as far as you can and hide behind him . Ciera was going home that night . They even knew they were going home that night . It was unfortunate that Caleb had that emotional last-minute decision . I was n't going to draw rocks . I saw the writing on the wall that it was going to be a tie . I had to switch strategies .
Holmes : We talked a lot before the show about who would n't have been brought on this show if they were n't someone 's loved one . Who did n't feel right for “ Survivor. ” And you and Brad were probably the last people on everyone 's list . You 've got a great story , you were always thinking of new strategies , really fun to watch . It seems like your appearance on “ Survivor ” was another step in an amazing journey .
Baskauskas : Thanks , Gordon . In addition to overcoming a lot in my life , you have to understand that I am a huge “ Survivor ” fan . I 've been a fan of the show even before Aras was on the show . So for me being out there , it was one of those life goals I 've always wanted to accomplish . It was an amazing time . I feel lucky that I 've come so far in my life .
Holmes : So you finally get to achieve your dream , and some jerk ruins it by making you their pre-season pick .
Baskauskas : ( Laughs ) I would n't put it all on yourself . The responsibility for getting voted out was on me .

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Thursday told Parliament that no incident , as reported in the media , took place in Alwar , Rajasthan . Naqvi was responding to Congress MP Madhusudan Mistry 's statement that cow safety volunteers or gau rakshaks had attacked vehicles transporting cattle and killed a man , besides injuring several others .
This is what Naqvi said in Rajya Sabha today :

“ Hamare desh mein yeh message nahi jana chahiye ki hum yeh hatya ko samarthan kar raha hai… issliye it is a very sensitive issue .. crore logo ke bhavnao se judha hua mudha hai .. hamara aisa koi message nahi jana chahiye ki hum hatiya ke samarthan mein khade hue hai ( This issue is a very sensitive issue . There should be no indication or message that we are backing those who are violent . It 's an emotional issue for crores of people . )
Issliye jis particular state ki barein mein jo baat kar rahe hai , us tarah ki koi bhi ghatna , jis tarah ki ghatna pesh ki ja rahi hai , aise koi ghatna zameen par nahi hui hai . Jis media report ki barein mein bat ki ja rahi hai , us state ki sarkar ne pehle hi condemn kiya hai . ( No such incident , as being reported , has taken place on the ground . The media report which are being cited , the concerned state government has already condemned . ) ”
Responding to Naqvi , Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said : “ I am extremely sorry that the minister is so ill-informed . Even the New York Times knows and the minister does n't know . ”
Terming the matter serious in nature , deputy chairperson PJ Kurien said they were not convinced by both sides and they asked Naqvi to ask Home Minister Rajnath Singh to submit a report to the House . “ I can not go by media reports , ” Kurien said .
Earlier , as the House convened , Opposition MPs demanded that the deputy chairperson PJ Kurien allow members to speak on the matter as it was very serious in nature . While Kurien initially insisted that it would be permitted during Zero Hour , the MPs persisted following which they allowed Mistry to make a statement .

Meanwhile , Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi expressed their anguish at what they said was the failure of law and order in Rajasthan . “ When government abdicates responsibility and allows to lynch mobs to rule , tragedies of immense proportion follow . Shocking breakdown of law & order in Alwar . All right thinking Indians must condemn this blind brutality . We expect Govt to take strict action against those responsible for this brutal & senseless attack . ”
The civil rights icon joined in on the trend started by Christian Slater on Wednesday night 's episode .
Guest Christian Slater got everyone crowd-surfing on Wednesday 's Late Show .
The Mr . Robot star talked about stage-diving in their interview with host Stephen Colbert and said , `` That could happen tonight . I could dive out there . '' The audience cheered wildly and later on Colbert proposed they go out together and surf the crowd .
You 're the Worst actor Chris Geere was the guest after Slater , and they jumped at the chance to follow Slater and Colbert 's lead .
The best part of the evening , though , was reserved for Congressman John Lewis . The 76-year-old civil rights icon did n't hesitate for a second when Colbert said `` Do you want to crowd-surf ? '' at the end of their interview . `` Yes , '' replied Lewis , who was on the show to talk about the third volume of their graphic novel March . Colbert double-checked to confirm by saying `` Do you want to jump into the crowd with me ? '' Lewis nodded , stood up and walked over to the crowd .
The audience greeted them with outstretched arms and carried them across the Ed Sullivan Theater with their hands .
A number of western militaries are in the process of upgrading their ageing armoured vehicle fleets . Denmark , Poland , Canada and the United States are just some of the countries which have committed themselves to large modernisation programmes . The British Army is also beginning an extensive upgrade for its existing Warrior fleet .
Last month , Denmark 's Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organisation concluded the testing phase on its armoured personnel carrier ( APC ) replacement programme . The competition to build 400 vehicles has seen BAE Systems , General Dynamics , FFG Flensburger and Nexter all submit bids . The tender includes both tracked and wheeled vehicles and V-shaped and standard-hull vehicles .
With so many options available , what are the most ground-breaking armoured vehicle technologies ?
Vehicle protection
Hull : V-Shaped or Flat ?
`` The defining feature of these vehicles is the V-shaped hull , which deflects the force of a blast away from soldiers inside the vehicle . ''
Anti-tank mines and IEDs have become the weapon of choice in recent years , killing hundreds in Afghanistan and Iraq and maiming thousands more . As a response , western militaries have introduced newer equipment such as the Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected ( MRAP ) vehicle . The defining feature of these vehicles is the V-shaped hull , which deflects the force of a blast away from soldiers inside the vehicle .
But these vehicles are not without their flaws . The V-shaped hull means they have to be taller , which gives them a higher centre of gravity than normal , reducing mobility .
This has been a contributing factor to many accidents in theatre , which not only injures the crew but also leaves them dangerously exposed to enemy attack .
Because of these drawbacks and a move away from counter-insurgency operations ( where IED threat levels are high ) , many armies across the world are staying with the tracked , standard-hull vehicle . The British Army is upgrading its flat-bottomed Warrior fighting vehicles to extend their life to 2040 , while the US Army is likely to replace its Bradley vehicle with a similar flat-hulled system .
The V-shaped vs. flat hull debate will continue to rage for some time .
Composites
While disagreement lingers on vehicle hull design , there is at least consensus on introducing lighter materials in armour manufacturing . Similar to the aerospace sector , composite materials are being used to reduce weight , while still maintaining key ballistic and blast protection . Engineers claim they can now mould a vehicle shell that weighs just less than one tonne , rather than the two tonnes for steel , with similar protection properties .
Vehicles , like Supacat 's SPV400 , have a fully composite armour ‘ pod ' which can also be supplemented with ceramic plates if necessary .
Reducing weight through using composites means a vehicle can carry more fuel , ammunition and troops if required . Using composites will also reduce a vehicle 's overall through-life costs , while increasing its service life , mainly because composites will not rust or suffer from fatigue like metal parts .
RPG armour
Vehicles deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq are fitted with slat armour – also known as bar armour – which is designed to sit inches away from the main armour and disrupt the shaped charge of a rocket-propelled grenade when it explodes . But this vital lifesaver also has its drawbacks , which are being addressed in newer armour .
`` Reducing weight through using composites means a vehicle can carry more fuel , ammunition and troops . ''
In a similar vein to composite technology , slat armour is being revolutionised using robust textile-based materials instead of metal . Lightweight protection like Amsafe Bridport 's Tarian armour uses complex interlaced fabrics and materials inside a protective coating , giving it the appearance of a heavy-duty metal wire , but is actually very light fabric .
`` It is incredibly lightweight , '' says Tarian product line manager Mike Taylor . `` It only weighs ten percent of the old bar armour that 's fitted to most vehicles traditionally . For the first time we can fit an RPG protection system to a lightweight vehicle such as the Navistar Huskey vehicle . ''
Tarian can be repaired by non-specialist soldiers and also disassembled in around 20 minutes . The revolutionary armour can fold flat against the vehicle it is fitted on and does not have to be removed for transportation , which saves time and money .
Systems and sensors
Communications
Future vehicles will give soldiers unrivalled tactical capabilities by being networked to other military assets while also being able to drive in all weather conditions , day and night . This is thanks to systems which give the warfighter real-time situational awareness on the battlefield and unrivalled command and control capabilities .
`` Future vehicles will give soldiers unrivalled tactical capabilities by being networked to other military assets . ''
In the last decade , the US Army has fielded the successful Force XXI Battle Command , Brigade-and-Below ( FBCB2 ) communications platform across its deployed vehicle fleet . The system , which first saw use in Iraq , allows vehicle commanders to view real-time data on the location of friendly and enemy forces . The information is relayed on ruggedised touch-screen displays , which can give accurate locations on detailed maps and email-like communication between units .
The platform is now in the process of further upgrades costing the US Army US $ 455m , this includes new ruggedised wireless tablets with vehicle docking stations and upgrading satellite network speeds . Information availability will also be increased with soldiers able to plot the location of IEDs for units on the network and also send text messages for medical evacuations if radio communications are not available .
Optics
Additionally , the situational awareness afforded by systems like FBCB2 – and the British Army 's Bowman system – can be supplemented with advanced optics , which give vehicle operators unparalleled vision in low-visibility conditions . BAE Systems ' Driver 's Vision Enhancer ( DVE ) equipment , a series of infra-red cameras and driver displays , means soldiers can see clearly at night and in fog and dust .
This , coupled with FBCB2 , gives commanders a superhuman view of the battlefield and a significant tactical advantage .
Because DVE systems rely on long-wave infra-red – a significant step-up from night-vision equipment – vehicle displays can also pick up heat signatures from IEDs and recently-fired weapons . Technology like this has proved vital in reducing casualties and will continue to do so in future conflicts , as the capability evolves .
Vehicle components
Wheels and tyre technology
European vehicle procurement has shifted to medium-weight wheeled vehicles such as France 's Véhicule Blindé de Combat d'Infanterie ( VBCI ) . But these vehicles remain vulnerable to small-arms fire and shrapnel , especially their soft rubber tyres , which can be immobilised with relative ease . Manufacturers are finding innovative ways to reduce this with advanced components such as runflat technology .
Tyres are the primary target in immobilising a wheeled vehicle . It is therefore vital that a vehicle can escape at high speed , or complete its mission with one or all tyres flat . Hutchinson , a subsidiary of petroleum-giant Total , offers militaries worldwide runflat technology . Their Beadlock system ensures the tyre beads are clamped at all pressure conditions , preventing the tyre slipping when punctured .
Vehicle operators can also optimise off-road performance by varying the pressure inside the cabin , without any need to go outside .
This means tyres can be deflated when off-road but also inflated when using normal tarmac roads . Most wheeled armoured vehicles developed today have this technology fitted as standard .
Hybrid engines
Armoured vehicles and tanks have traditionally been gas guzzlers – the M1A1 Abrams tank needs two gallons of fuel to go one mile – but developers are looking seriously at green technologies for future vehicles . To have vehicles at your disposal which rely less on fuel , and the costly logistical process this entails , is a valuable asset for any military planner .
`` Manufacturers are finding innovative ways to reduce this with advanced components such as runflat technology . ''
Last month , the US Army Tank Automotive Research , Development and Engineering Center ( TARDEC ) , began the advanced testing of a new hybrid Ultra Light Vehicle ( ULV ) . The ULV is driven by two electric motors and a lightweight diesel engine , the latter provides power to the motors and high-torque at low speeds . Importantly , the electric motors eliminate the need for a driveshaft and so the underbody will perform better in an IED or mine blast .
A smooth underbody , coupled with protection comparable with currently-fielded MRAPs , means the ULV could offer enhanced survivability for soldiers . The ULV is purely a proof-of-concept project , which is funded by the Office of the Secretary of Defense , but it already demonstrates significant advances in vehicle design . In only 16 months , the project has quickly moved from design to prototype .
Weapons
Remote weapon systems
Since the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq , there has been a significant shift from manned weapons on vehicles towards newer remote-controlled systems . BAE Systems South Africa has developed the Tactical Remote Turret ( TRT ) , a modular system which can support a number of weapons .
TRTs offers several advantages over legacy systems , including multiple weapon systems on one turret , rapid-fire cannons ( 20mm or 30mm ) , co-axial machine gun and anti-tank guided missiles . The use of electro-optical sights means an enemy can fired upon from up to 3,000m away , and with infra-red , almost 8,000m away at night .
Renault Trucks Defense ( RTD ) has fitted the TRT system to the newest iteration of their popular VAB APC , the Mk III . RTD say there is more protection for the soldiers because they do not have to go outside the vehicle and it is lighter . There are no mechanisms for the turret inside the vehicle , so internal volume is maintained .
Lasers – the directed energy weapon option
Looking beyond conventional bombs and bullets , manufacturers are also experimenting with vehicle-mounted directed energy weapons ( DEW ) – or lasers . Boeing converted one of its AN/TWQ-1 Avenger air defense systems – a modified Humvee capable of firing Stinger missiles – with a solid-state laser weapon . The ‘ Laser Avenger ' system was the first-ever vehicle to shoot down a UAV with a laser . Boeing says the system can be operational within a year and can also destroy IEDs .
Lasers offer a number of advantages over conventional weapons . They do not require ammunition resupplies – reducing logistics costs – and also offer rapid engagement of multiple targets . The US Army has yet to make any firm decision on Boeing 's Laser Avenger , but DEW technology remains a rapidly advancing technology across all domains .
Concepts
Modular systems
`` TRTs offers several advantages over legacy systems , including multiple weapon systems on one turret . ''
Modularity , in military procurement terms , can often be interpreted as ‘ more bang for your buck ' . Instead of buying a piece of equipment to carry out just one job , it is expected to take on Swiss-army knife qualities and carry out multiple roles . In the current age of austerity where every dollar counts , the modularity concept has again become the buzz-word for defence equipment procurement .
`` Modularity is really the key word for the future , '' said Michel Lautier , a former French colonel and military advisor to Nexter , who have just unveiled their new Titus modular vehicle .
This concept mirrors the changing concepts in tactical and strategic thinking , especially with the withdrawal from Afghanistan . Militaries across the world are concentrating on aligning their capabilities to a broad spectrum of conflict scenarios . After all , a vehicle designed for counterinsurgency may be useless in the next conflict .
Modular vehicles can adapt to different roles , often using ‘ operational kits ' which can be fitted or removed with relative ease and low cost . In the current period of austerity , this is an important capability for cash-strapped armies .
The return of the flying car
A piece on future systems can not fail to mention the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) . They are halfway through a five-year programme called DARPA TX or Transformer – a vehicle which will have vertical take-off and landing capabilities and can travel up to 250nm on a single tank of petrol .
Lockheed Martin 's Skunk Works – the team behind the SR-71 Blackbird and F-117 Nighthawk – is proposing a vehicle that will feature a pair of tilting ducted fans , which allow it to travel up to 200 knots and 10,000ft in the air . Lockheed could receive a contract to produce Transformer TX for its first flight in 2015 .
Although it is not likely to see operational combat for some years , DARPA 's project shows how far the century-old armoured military vehicle has come . This , along with technological advances in armour protection , systems and sensors , components and weapons means armoured vehicles will remain an essential part of the modern military 's inventory for the foreseeable future .

The Prime Directive : According to Star Trek canon , it 's the guiding principle of the United Federation of Planets and prohibits Starfleet personnel from interfering with the natural internal development of alien civilizations . First introduced about two-thirds of the way through the first season of the original series , the Prime Directive has cropped up in four of the five Trek series to date , with varying degrees of importance and success .
The problem with the Prime Directive is that while it prevents Starfleet or Federation personnel from interfering with other societies -- or worse , imposing its own values on them -- it also acts as a storytelling inhibitor . What is Captain Kirk supposed to do when they beam down to a planet where the local version of the Third Reich is about to launch its own Final Solution on another race of people -- just stand there ? The way Star Trek was set up , the show almost forced Kirk repeatedly into situations where they had to violate the Directive , and they did so . Otherwise we 'd be staring at a blank screen for most of that hour .
Here are 11 times that Kirk intervened in a society on another planet and violated the Prime Directive , along with one time that they played by the rules . Was they right or wrong ?

Bass Pro Shop and Cinemark Theaters will remain open for now since their buildings are n't owned by Lightstone .
Since it opened in November 2014 , Artegon has marketed itself as an artisan marketplace — filled with dozens of small shops selling items such as clothes , pop artwork and home decor . Most tenants were local sellers who relished the chance to get an indoor shopping center location at lower prices .
The next direction of the 100-acre property that contains Artegon Marketplace is uncertain . Lightstone put the property on the market in October , and real estate professionals say it could be the future home to an outdoor shopping center , hotels or condominiums .
Artegon Marketplace is just one of several troubled malls that have struggled in recent months and years . Last week , Orlando Fashion Square mall was sued for foreclosure and filed bankruptcy . Macy 's also announced it was closing its store at Oviedo Mall .
And it 's also not the first time the property has closed . The center opened in 2003 as Festival Bay Mall , but that only lasted until 2011 .
Artegon 's owner has already recouped its $ 25 million investment , selling the properties for Bass Pro Shops and Cinemark Theaters for a combined $ 30 million .
Now , small retailers , such as Florida Soap Co. , are searching for new spaces . Owner Misty Wheeler-Belin said Artegon has given them a stable brick-and-mortar location , the kind they could n't previously afford .
Artegon Marketplace owner Lightstone Group put the mall on the market in August , as interest in the North International Drive area grows with a new Interstate 4 overpass in the works . Lightstone Group has not confirmed the closure yet .

`` It was short notice , but we always knew something like this might happen , '' said Wheeler-Belin . `` Artegon is owned by a real estate company . They are here to make money . ''
Real estate professionals say whatever happens there , it will include a major makeover .
`` It 's a really challenging property for retail , but there is a lot of interest too since it is so close to the theme parks , '' said John Crossman , a local shopping center developer .
Tenants at Artegon said it started slowly when opening in 2014 , but traffic has been building month by month .
`` We were busy and making money , '' Otown Ink Tattoo owner Wilmary Moy said . `` I have appointments two or three months out and nowhere to go . ''
Moy said they invested nearly $ 400,000 in mid-2015 with eight employees .
But Artegon also struggled at times , as have other malls nationwide .
Toby Keith 's I Love This Bar and Grill closed suddenly in July 2015 . A promised skate park never came .
After Artegon informed retailers of the decision Friday , Gods & Monsters owner Anna Young spent the day looking for a new storefront in the I-Drive area .
The shop was popular among comic book , board game and science-fiction fans for its events and game nights .
`` We 've already got a few places we are looking at , '' said Young . `` But we spent a lot making the place what it is . ''
It 's this kind of unique stores , which supported Artegon 's anti-mall marketing push to consumers , that Orlando 's Melissa Groeneveld will miss .
`` I liked that the stores were all their own and not the normal everyday retailers , '' Groeneveld said .

Woman sentenced to 2 days in jail because they could n't afford their truancy fines dies in jail ; judge says it was their only option .
John Vibes
June 12 , 2014
Eileen DiNino , a 55 year old mother of 7 was sent to prison because they could n't afford to pay for their children 's truancy fines . Tragically , after serving half of their two day prison sentence , they were found dead in their cell .
District Judge Dean R. Patton of Reading , Pennsylvania sentenced Ms. DiNino to two days in prison to erase roughly $ 2,000 in fines .
Patton sent the woman away to prison against their better judgement , but as with most government jobs , Patton is required to ignore their own conscience to abide by federal and state laws .
Them cause of death has yet to be determined , but police say that it is “ not suspicious “ .
“ Did something happen ? Was they scared to death ? This lady did n't need to be there . We do n't do debtors prisons anymore . That went out 100 years ago. ” Patton told the Star Tribune .
Patton said they have lost sleep over their death .
It has become more and more common for poor people to get caught up in the system because they cant pay their bills .
Many people think that debtors prisons are a thing of the past , but they are unfortunately alive and well . According to the Reading Eagle , in Berks County , where this tragedy occurred , more than 1,600 people have been jailed for truancy related offenses . One could only imagine how many cases exist in the entire state of Pennsylvania , or even the entire country .
Human Rights Watch released its own investigation earlier this year , highlighting the disturbing trend of debt related prison sentences .
A woman has died in jail , away from their family , because their son did n't attend the required amount of days in the state indoctrination facility known as public school ; and we call this ‘ justice . '

Approximately twenty-four hours before landing , the crew will move from the transit habitat into the landing module , bringing some of the supplies from the transit habitat . The landing module will then detach from the transit habitat , which is too large to land on Mars . The transit habitat is discarded and stays in orbit around the sun .
The landing technology will be the same as used for previous cargo missions . This will ensure that the human crew lands in a system that has been tested several times already . Upon landing , the crew takes up to forty-eight hours to get used to gravity after spending six to eight months in space . The astronauts will leave the lander in their Mars suits and will be picked up by the rover that will bring them to the outpost . They will enter the settlement through an airlock and spend the next few days in one of the living units , recovering and settling into their new environment . After their acclimatization period , the crew will deploy the rest of the solar panels , install the hallways between the landers , and set up food production units .
Redundancy is extremely important , because the astronauts ca n't abandon their mission in case of an emergency . When the first crew lands , it will find the established outpost with good redundancy as it will include two living units , each large enough to house the crew of four , and two life support units that are each capable of providing enough water , power , and breathable air for the entire crew . To add even more redundancy , the cargo for the second crew will land within a few weeks after the first crew has landed .
When the hardware for the second crew is incorporated , the crew of four astronauts will have four living units and four life support units , enough to sustain a crew of sixteen astronauts .

1902 Land Office Map of the Island of Oahu , Hawaii ( Honolulu )
This varies large , rare , and extraordinary 1902 map of the island of Ohau , Hawaii , was prepared for the 1906 Report of the Governor of the Territory of Hawaii to the Secretary of the Interior . The areas of Honolulu , Pearl Harbor , Diamond Head , Koko Head and Kailua Bay are described , as well as the charmingly-named Cocoa-Nut Grove on Maunaloa Bay , complete with tiny coconut trees . Though the cartographic work that produced this map was started in 1878 , during the Hawaiian Monarchy , the map itself , and the report that contained it , was issued following the U.S. Government 's 1898 annexation of the Hawaiian Republic . The Report was an attempt to assess and examine the newly created Hawaiian Territory 's potential for proper administration and development . Consequently the map focuses on Public Lands , Homestead Settlement Tracts , Grazing Lands , Pineapple Lands , Sugar Plantations , Forest Reserves , Forest Lands , Wet Lands , etc . It also features both practical and topographic details for use in administering the region . The governor at this time was George R. Carter . The primary triangulation for this map was accomplished by Walter E. Wall . The map itself was drawn by John M. Donn .

A group “ demanding ” votes on gun-friendly legislation hoped showcasing their firearms at a rally Monday would encourage lawmakers to pass bills that would void gun-free zones , allow concealed handgun licensees to carry pistols openly and require universities to allow guns in classrooms .
“ We are n't really protesting , we are demanding , ” said Michelle Prescott , founder of Texan Gun Rights , prior to leading a march of about 40 gun rights advocates around the outside of the Capitol .
The group , which had about 10 individuals strapped with rifles and shotguns including at least five AR-15s , were urging lawmakers to vote on House Bill 700 , known as the ‘ open-carry ' bill , HB 3218 , which would get rid of gun-free zones , and Senate Bill 182 , which would require schools to allow CHL holders to carry guns in college classrooms .
Prescott said although they support open-carry legislation , they would not carry openly if it were legal .
“ I like to keep 'em guessing , ” they said . “ But it should be an individual 's choice . ”
Some activists carried AR-15 's , other rifles and shotguns at the rally , while others carried signs reading , “ Do n't Tread On Me , ” and “ The 1st Amendment does n't exist without the 2nd . ”
Scott Trent , an Austin-area activist who carried their 12-gauge shotgun accessorized with a pistol-grip , said they “ was going to bring an AR-15 , but I figured that 's what everyone else would bring . ”
State law allows individuals to carry long rifles openly , but pistols must be concealed and the individual must have a state-issued license .
Joushua Neff , also from Austin , carried their AR-15 on their back . They said they attended to “ show peaceful support ” and hoped carrying the weapon in public would prove gun-owners are responsible citizens .
Prescott slammed lawmakers for allowing a tapered version of campus carry to pass through the House , which allows schools to opt-out of the law .
“ It 's just a warm and fuzzy bill , ” they said . “ It 's a way for the Rep. to say ‘ I got a gun bill passed ' . ”
Prescott called out state Rep. Joe Pickett , D-El Paso , for leaving the open-carry proposal pending in their Homeland Security and Public Safety committee .
“ What the folks pushing those bills did n't mention are the other bills that are still pending in this committee , ” Pickett said . “ We 've heard national and state polls that show a huge percent support background checks , yet we have not passed some of those bills . I think what we are doing is balance and I think there are enough gun related bills out there . ”
( CNN ) -- A year ago , Maydellyn Lamourt watched their 16-year-old son 's dreams fall apart .
The outgoing sophomore who enjoyed playing sports was charged and sentenced as an adult in Connecticut for third-degree assault .
The crime : They and a friend stole a pack of gum from another teen .
Because they entered the adult penal system , the teen 's prospects of joining the Marines are dim . Their troubles have landed them in an alternative high school .
If Lamourt 's son had committed the crime this month , their situation would be different . Their record would have been sealed in the juvenile system .
Earlier this month , Connecticut raised from 16 to 17 the age at which a juvenile is automatically prosecuted as an adult . The change comes at a time when the `` adult time for adult crime '' mentality is being re-examined in several states and challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court .
Connecticut child advocates say the juvenile system is better suited for teens because it offers more access to rehabilitative programs , schooling , community-based programming and supervision from juvenile probation officers . In felony cases , judges can still decide on a case-by-case basis whether to transfer juveniles younger than 17 to the adult system .
`` I was devastated that my son would be in corrections with grown men , '' said Lamourt . Them son spent a month at a adult facility that housed juveniles and young adults .
`` He feels like from here on down , everything will go downhill , '' they said .
This year , the Supreme Court will consider whether juvenile offenses merit adult punishment . The justices could decide whether juveniles can be sentenced to life without parole for crimes other than murder . One case involves a Florida inmate , who was convicted of rape at the age of 13 and given a sentence of life without parole .
Juvenile courts have always had the ability to transfer teens and children to the adult system , but a spike in youth crime during the 1980s and 1990s prompted states to implement mandatory sentencing policies for certain crimes and lower the age at which a child can be sentenced to adult court .
Until this year , Connecticut was one of three states , along with New York and North Carolina , to automatically place teen offenders 16 and older in the adult system . Ten other states automatically transfer juveniles 17 and older to the adult system -- including South Carolina , Georgia and Texas .
The decision to raise the age of adult court jurisdiction in Connecticut was spurred by the 2005 suicide of David Burgos . Burgos , a lanky 17-year-old known to family for their sense of humor , suffered from mental illness when they were charged and sentenced as an adult for violating probation .
Burgo hung themselves with a sheet in their cell at Manson Youth Institution , a corrections facility that also houses offenders between 18 and 21 . Their suicide galvanized Connecticut lawmakers to raise the age in which a juvenile can be moved into adult corrections system .
`` When you teach someone to swim , you do n't just throw them in the deep end and hope they do great , '' said Abby Anderson , executive director of the Connecticut Juvenile Justice Alliance , the nonprofit agency that spearheaded the campaign to change the law .
Originally , Connecticut child advocates pushed legislation that raised the age to 18 , but budget cuts forced the state to raise the age to 17 .
The policy shift in Connecticut , a state that once sent the highest number of juveniles to the adult system , is catching on in other states . This month , Illinois stopped sending 17-year-olds who commit misdemeanors to the adult system . Instead , the offenders are sent to the juvenile system where drug treatment and counseling are often required .
In North Carolina , another state where the criminal justice system automatically views 16-year-olds as adults , a bill was introduced last spring to raise the age a teen can be charged as an adult to 18 . That measure in the bill was rejected , but lawmakers established a task force to study the proposal with a deadline of 2011 .
Meanwhile , lobbying efforts to raise the age continue in other states . In Georgia and Wisconsin , where a 17-year-old is considered an adult , lawmakers and juvenile advocates have been working toward change for the past year .
A precise number of how many children are tried in adult court is difficult to ascertain because states keep records differently , but some experts estimate about a quarter of juveniles are prosecuted in the adult court system .
On a single day in 2008 , more than 7,700 children younger than 18 were held in adult local jails and 3,600 in adult state prisons , according to a 2009 University of Texas-Austin report .
The juvenile system is based on a rehabilitative approach , compared to the punitive adult system , child advocates point out . They argue that the adult system teaches juveniles to become adult criminals , which places the community at risk .
While some states are questioning their juvenile sentencing policies , sentencing experts say raising the ages or eliminating mandatory sentences remains politically risky . Much of what states decide to do with their juvenile policies may depend upon Connecticut 's outcome .
Jeffrey Fagan , a Columbia University law professor who has studied juvenile crime , said they think reform will come in stages , such as Illinois ' new law , which addresses juveniles committing misdemeanors but not other crimes .
`` It 's easier to sell to the public and implement , '' Fagan said .
The policy changes in Connecticut occurred largely because of a growing body of brain research distinguishing the adolescent and adult minds . In 2005 , the Supreme Court cited differences in the adolescent and adult brains as a reason for abolishing the death penalty for juveniles .
Up until the last decade , scientific research on the adolescent brain was largely nonexistent . Led by professor Laurence Steinberg of Temple University and others in the psychology field , their research explained why juveniles lack control and understanding of long-term consequence and are more susceptible to peer pressure .
`` The teenage brain is like a car with a good accelerator but a weak brake , '' Steinberg wrote . `` With powerful impulses under poor control , the likely result is a crash . ''
Critics argue that sending juveniles to the adult system can deter other teens . They point out that juvenile crime has declined in recent years .
Maydellyn Lamourt says they warned their son about the dangers of a life of crime , citing mistakes they had made . Lamourt spent eight months in prison after being convicted of larceny and drug possession in 2004 .
Like their son , the mother knows firsthand the consequences of having a criminal record .
`` It follows you for life , '' they said .
The next Games provide baseball a rare opportunity to sell itself on the world stage – and it needs its best players to showcase the sport
The 2016 Summer Olympics are over . Baseball is an Olympic sport again .
Left out of the Games in London and Rio , baseball ( along with its pal softball ) is set to return again in Tokyo in 2020 . There is no commitment to the sport beyond Tokyo , however , which means the sport ca n't afford to blow its opportunity on the international stage . As big as the “ World ” Series claims to be , baseball 's only truly global showcase comes when it 's allowed to be seen every four years along with the rest of the big-time Olympic sports : track and field , swimming , dressage and the like .
The sport needs to put on a show in Tokyo or it might not get another chance – and doing so will require participation from the best players in the game . Think about the excitement surrounding the 1992 Dream Team , only imagine Michael Jordan as a baseball player . OK , bad idea . But you get my point .
Mike Trout , Kris Bryant , Mookie Betts , Clayton Kershaw , all in red , white and blue and taking on the best of the best from the other top baseball nations . Bat flips from around the world , chanting , brushback pitches , baseball 's unwritten rules unwritten in every language . Host nation Tokyo might even feature a 46-year old , .300-hitting Olympian Ichiro . Everything about it sounds amazing .
A star-studded tournament would get attention both in the US and around the world and the huge , enthusiastic crowds that would undoubtedly show up to the games in Tokyo would make the sport one of the Games ' big stories . This would be far from the contrived World Baseball Classic , an event with no history . This new form of Olympic baseball would feature the best baseball players in the world playing in the ultimate global sports tournament , with hundreds of millions watching around the world ( give or take a few tens of millions of millennials , right NBC ? )
The only problem is that Major League Baseball does n't want to send its stars to the Olympics because the Summer Games happen just as the pennant chase heats up . The 2020 Games will run from 24 July to 9 August , holy summer days for those who worship baseball as it has always been . But this is old thinking that new commissioner Rob Manfred hopefully wo n't adopt . Manfred has already said they are open to reducing the regular season to 154 games . So cut eight games off the regular season in 2020 , ditch the all-star game along with it – the wildly unpopular event earned record low ratings in July – and , abracadabra , we 've instantly found the two weeks we need to sell baseball to the world .
There is no downside . The players who do n't make an Olympic team get time to nurse injuries and rest up for the pennant chase , MLB can make the 31 July trade deadline into a multi-day , mega-hyped event , the game 's best players will get to battle it out for their countries – while staying fresh for their U.S. teams – and maybe just win a few million fans the world over will fall in love with the sport . It 's a win , win , win , etc .
The safe bet is that baseball goes its regular route and fills the US Olympic roster with the usual retreads and nobodies . For who , outside of everyone , can forget the fearsome 2008 Team USA lineup with Nate Schierholtz , Jayson Nix and Taylor Teagarden ? Or it can do something very un-baseball-like , go bold and try to sell the game to a new generation .
The NHL has allowed its season to be interrupted for the Olympics since 1998 and ice hockey has been a huge part of the Games ever since . And this during the tenure of Gary Bettman . Gary Bettman . Does Manfred want their legacy to be that they were a worse commissioner than Gary Bettman ? That 's their choice . And there 's only one good option for them and the sport : baseball must go all-in on the 2020 Olympics .
Video of the Week
Oregon Little League coach Joel Jensen called timeout on Tuesday at the LLWS to tell their son that they love him . It 's easy to be a little cynical about ultra-competitive youth sports , but this is undoubtedly a nice , tender and sincere moment . Although , if you are very cynical about youth sports , you could say they feel this way about their talented son because the kid has major league potential . Who does n't love a meal ticket ?
Quote of the Week
“ It 's boring out there. ” - Mets broadcaster Keith Hernandez , explaining why infielders often go to the mound when the pitching coach comes out to speak to the pitcher .
David Schoenfield ( @ dschoenfield ) Keith Hernandez on why infielders go to the mound when the pitching coach comes out : `` It 's boring out there . ''
Be honest , Keith . Infielders go to the mound because they hope their coach will tell them that they love them .
Who 's closer to victory : Donald Trump of the Cubs ?
Donald Trump continues to trail in most every national poll and is down big in several key swing states , while the Cubs became the first MLB team to 80 wins this week and remain the favorite to win their first World Series . Of course , things could change if Trump follows trough on their old threat and drops an October surprise on the Cubs .
Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) I hear the Rickets family , who own the Chicago Cubs , are secretly spending $ 's against me . They better be careful , they have a lot to hide !
Although , history has proven that an October surprise related to the Cubs would be ... the Cubs winning the World Series . Feels like a lose-lose for Trump .
How did the kids piss off Goose Gossage this week ?
While there is no particular Goose Gossage connection to this week 's lesson in baseball 's code , it does harken back to the fight the former Yankees reliever got into with teammate Cliff Johnson in 1979 . That brawl left Gossage with a broken thumb , whereas this week 's baseball punching left A 's DH Billy Butler with a head injury thanks to team-mate Danny Valencia .
The Butler-Valencia bout reportedly started when Butler told a shoe brand representative that Valencia was wearing a pair of off-brand cleats in breach of their contract . For this bit of teammate snitching , Butler received a punch to the face from Valencia . Sometimes baseball 's code is confusing . Not in this case . Go out of your way to tell on a coworker and get punched in the face . That 's common sense and karma .
Nine thoughts in order
1 ) It 's still too early to determine who truly “ won ” and “ lost ” last month 's non-waiver trade deadline , but there are definitely early contenders . Andrew Miller has been outstanding since going to Cleveland from the Yankees , posting a 1.69 ERA and 0.46 WHIP with two saves and 16 strikeouts in 10 and two-thirds innings . Watch them dominate the A 's here on Monday night with three straight Ks to pick up the save in a 1-0 win .
Scott @ WFNY ( @ WFNYScott ) Schools back in . Here 's How to Properly Pitch a Ninth Inning with Dr. Andrew Miller https : //t.co/pON4aHnHKu
Then there 's the case of Josh Reddick , late of the A 's , who the Dodgers picked up before the deadline . He 's hitting .149 under the careful watch of Magic Johnson in LA , including no home runs and no runs batted in more than 70 plate appearances . That 's pretty tough to do . Even tougher to do ? Injure yourself while getting room service .
Andy McCullough ( @ McCulloughTimes ) Josh Reddick hurt their finger when their hand got caught in a door last night while ordering room service . `` This is rock bottom , '' they cracked .
2 ) The Cardinals still have a hold on the last wildcard spot in the National League , but they 're not making it look easy . Despite having the Best Fans in Baseball™ St Louis somehow have the fourth-worst home record in all baseball . That becomes a serious problem due to the fact that the Cardinals have a narrow lead over the Marlins and Pirates for that last wildcard spot and close out their season with six games at Busch Stadium – including Games 160 , 161 and 162 versus Pittsburgh . Imagine a scenario in which the Cardinals go from a playoff position in the final week to missing the postseason completely thanks to gagging on that final homestand . Could they end their season by get booed off their home field by the Best Fans ? This truly could be a dream season for Cubs fans .
3 ) Yankees COO Hank Steinbrenner told the New York Post that part of what convinced them to go all-in on the team rebuilding was because Yankee fans on social media supported a youth movement . They no doubt did . Because the general consensus on social media about sports , politics/movies/music/gardening/whatever issue is dominating the news cycle sucks big time . In fact , it might just be the worst ever and the complete opposite must be done straight away . So expect Yankees fans on social media to be pushing for some veteran additions upon completion of the first three-game losing streak .
4 ) The first place Dodgers currently have seven starters on the DL : Clayton Kershaw , Hyun-Jin Ryu , Brandon McCarthy , Rich Hill , Alex Wood , Brett Anderson and Scott Kazmir . That is more than $ 79m in payroll on the disabled list , meaning the Dodgers have to battle on with barely $ 185m worth of healthy players . Please keep them in your thoughts during this difficult time .
5 ) The art of pitch framing has been around since the first catcher wanted to buy a call from the home plate ump , but it 's only in recent years – beginning around 2006 with the introduction of the PITCHf/x pitching tracking system – that teams were able to quantify the skill and then compensate catchers who do it well . Now we are beginning to see catchers who grew up in this era arrive on the big stage of the Little League World Series . Expect this kid to receive a large bubble gum bonus from management .
6 ) Blue Jays slugger Edwin Encarnacion is being sued for more than $ 11.5m by a woman who claims they gave their STDs . Their agent has said that the charges are “ completely inappropriate and meritless ” and that the designated hitter will “ take every legal measure to defend themselves against this meritless claim. ” The courts will decide that , but I think we can all agree that STD feels a bit outdated in modern baseball . Surely there is something like xSTD , STD+ or VORstD that can more accurately judge what Encarnacion did or did not give .
7 ) With Derek Jeter retiring from baseball two years ago , A-Rod going out two weeks ago and David Ortiz leaving the game two months from now , there may be a lot of fans without a favorite player in the sport . If you are such a fan , consider filling that hole with Royals third baseman Cheslor Cuthbert . He 's a 23-year old rookie batting .292 with 10 home runs . That covers the baseball part .
Now for the much more interesting off-the-field component : the Venezuela native used a chunk of the $ 1.9m signing bonus they received in 2009 to buy chickens and now has nearly 300 of them waiting for them back at home . “ He gets photos and videos and makes calls to their caretaker everyday , ” their sister told La Prensa . “ He adores them. ” How can you not root for a man with a phone full of pictures of their pet chickens ? And , please , people of Kansas City , try to consider the man 's feelings . Do n't eat your massive platters of barbecue chicken right in front of him .
8 ) MLB released the postseason schedule this week . A few dates you 'll want to keep open :
– Tuesday 25 October : Game 1 of the World Series .
– Wednesday 2 November : Game 7 of the World Series , if necessary .
– Friday 7 October : four playoff games in one day with the NLDS Game 1s and the ALDS Game 2s .
– Tuesday 4 October : postseason opens with the AL wildcard game .
– Wednesday 5 October : Pittsburgh Pirates lose in the NL wildcard to team TBD .
9 ) After each of the last three Summer Olympics , the football world has pondered if Usain Bolt could play in the NFL . Just last week , former coach Tony Dungy said he 'd use Bolt as a receiver to “ clear out one side of the field ” with their speed , while Falcons receiver Julio Jones said Bolt would struggle without the “ burst ” he 'd need to get off the line of scrimmage .
But why are we always projecting Bolt into football ? Why could n't they be a MLB pinch runner ? And a late-inning defensive replacement to run down balls hit into the gap Billy Hamilton-style ? Sure , it 's improbable , but it seems more likely to happen than a football career . That reminds me , there 's one more date coming up on the baseball calendar that you 'll want to remember : Tim Tebow 's baseball tryout is now set for 30 August in Los Angeles .
A man who drove their Hummer into the path of a speeding car to prevent it from hitting four pedestrians near Bonnie Doon Mall in August was recognized for their bravery on Monday .
Darrell Krushelnicki is one of 26 people receiving medals of bravery from the Royal Canadian Humane Association for heroic actions across the province .
A group of teens was crossing the street when a car driven by a suspected distracted driver barrelled toward them .
Krushelnicki reacted instinctively , they said , driving their Hummer into the path of the car .
`` It was a situation again where many things could have gone wrong and I believe the absolute best thing took place , '' they said . `` Twisted metal is just that — it can be replaced and the lives ca n't . ''
`` I wanted to come down here and say thank you for what they did 'cause they did n't actually have to do that , '' said Kyle McInnes , one of the teens saved by Krushelnicki .
Krushelnicki does n't consider themselves a hero .
`` It simply was one of those scenarios where you could see what was going to happen just before it was happening and I just reacted , '' they said . `` I just reacted the way I believe anybody would . ''
Dion Lefebvre was awarded a bronze medal for their efforts to save victims of the horrific April 27th crash on Highway 63 that claimed seven lives . ( CBC )
Two others honoured at the ceremony were Tyler Fowler and Dion Lefebvre who helped save a man and a boy in a crash on Highway 63 near Wandering River on April 27th that claimed seven lives .
Lefebvre pulled three-year-old Timothy Wheaton out of a burning vehicle . They also helped rescue Faith Kondusky-Sennett , 11 , from the second burning truck . The 11-year-old later died in hospital .
Fowler , who was passing by the scene with their father , pulled Mark Penney , the only other survivor , to safety .
Lefebvre said the events of the day went through their head as they went up to accept their medal on Monday .
`` I would like to think that if my family or my kids were in a similar situation , somebody would be there to help them , '' they said .
Also honoured on Monday were Len Chisholm and Mark Lohse , who plucked former Edmonton Oiler anthem singer Paul Lorieau from the cold waters of Kinbasket Lake near Valemont , B.C. , last August .
Audrey MacLean describes themselves as an accidental technologist , an accidental entrepreneur , and an accidental investor . But at the age of eight , they made at least one plan : They would earn a college scholarship . Ms. MacLean , 59 , executed that plan and went on to help start Network Equipment Technologies , which went public in 1987 . Later , they were a founder and chief executive of Adaptive . They have given seed financing to numerous successful start-ups including Pure Software ( founded by Netflix 's Reed Hastings ) , AdForce and Selectica .
Ms. MacLean , who continues to invest in early-stage companies and mentor entrepreneurs , is now chairperson of Coraid , which designs and manufactures data storage products . They are also a Stanford professor , teaching graduate students in the department of management , science , and engineering . Recently , they discussed their early motivation to get an education , the advantages of being a woman in technology , and why a technical career offers the best path to changing the world . A condensed version of the conversation follows .
Q . Why were you so focused on getting a college scholarship ?
Ms. MacLean : I was one of 10 children . While the issue was financial , it went beyond that . My dad , who had views typical for the era , thought women went to college just to get their M.R.S . degree . And they thought that if I had college debt — a negative dowry — no one would want to marry me . In their view , they had four sons who had to go to college . So , when I was 8 , they told me I 'd have to get a scholarship if I wanted to go .
Q . How did you get interested in technology ?
Ms. MacLean : I never said , ‘ Gee , I want a career in tech . ' But I saw that I did well in math , and I was economically motivated . That 's where the jobs were .
Q . Technology is often described as a field that 's inhospitable to women . Has that been your experience ?
Ms. MacLean : When I entered the industry , it was burgeoning . Though being a woman was a novelty , it was growing so fast the opportunity was there , just as the opportunity was there for women during World War II . Tech is a true meritocracy . Either you have the goods or you do n't . There 's less concern with gender , race , color and creed . I really truly believe that , despite data on the dearth of women in technology , tech does n't have a barrier up to women . In fact , if anything , women who are technically prepared have an advantage .
Q . What 's that ?
Ms. MacLean : In my class , I require the students to form teams to do a four-person project . I do n't assign the teams . I 've noticed the guys seek the women out as teammates . I think the women are particularly good at bringing the team together and at presenting , which are extremely important skills when developing a product . Female engineers are also sought after . Women make up half the population , and companies want user interfaces that appeal to all buyers . In addition to generally being more collaborative , women have an intuitive sense of usability that leads to better products .
Q . So , what explains the discouraging statistics on women in tech ?
Ms. MacLean : If more women prepared themselves academically for tech jobs , they 'd get hired . Just like more doctors are women because more women have entered medical school . Women need to take advantage of technology courses at the university level , and not all major in communications or fashion design . It 's not that those things are n't worthwhile if you like them , but your career opportunities will be greater in I.T. , including those in green tech and medical tech . If women do n't get the required technical skills , they wo n't be positioned to move into core , general management roles with technology companies . C.E.O . 's do n't come from H.R . They come out of product development and marketing .
Q . You mentioned that no more than 20 percent of the students in your Technology Venture Formation course at Stanford are female , and that most of those women are foreign . What accounts for the scarcity of women in the United States ?
Ms. MacLean : In China , India and to some degree Russia , bright women are seeking technological educations . In emerging economies , the whole country has identified technology as the way out , the train to get on . There 's a competitive , lift-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps approach to bringing the country into the 21st century , and there 's testing at every educational level to identify talent . But in the U.S. , we feel we 've already made it . There are too many other options for women .
Q . What would get more women to choose careers in technology ?
Ms. MacLean : We need to get girls interested in computing by first grade . By fifth grade , it 's game over . Computing has an image crisis . A boy geek subculture has grown up around gaming that involves violence . It 's not something little girls aspire to . It 's not about lack of educational opportunities for women . Smart girls graduate from high school with straight A 's , go to college , and find themselves surrounded by guys who 've been hacking for 10 years . So they 're way behind . They get discouraged , and go into law or medicine .
Q . What 's the solution ?
Ms. MacLean : At both the educational level and the business level , we have to come up with games and contests that appeal to first- and second-grade girls . Not car and war games . Let them design games that change the world , or save the planet .
Q . Can tech really save the planet ?
Ms. MacLean : Whether you care about solving terrorism , curing cancer , or any other problem , tech can solve it . It 's not just tech for tech 's sake .

Olympic heptathlon champion Nafissatou Thiam won the European indoor pentathlon title in dominant fashion on Friday . The Belgian athlete got a personal-best 4,870 points , topping the standings in the high jump , shot put and 60-meter hurdles , as they beat Austria 's Ivona Dadic ( 4,767 ) and Hungarian Gyorgyi Zsivoczky-Farkas ( 4,723 ) .

The opening day of the championships was marred by what seemed an unusually sensitive system for detecting false starts .
The system twice flagged up false starts in the women 's 60-meter hurdles final . None of the athletes was found to be at fault in one case , and in the other a runner was disqualified – then swiftly reinstated on appeal . That followed a bizarre heat Friday morning in which four of seven athletes were disqualified .
Cindy Roleder of Germany eventually took the title in 7.88 seconds , with Alina Talay of Belarus second in 7.92 , and bronze for another German with Pamela Dutkiewicz clocking 7.95 . World record holder Susanna Kallur finished eighth in their last race before retirement .
Britain 's Andy Pozzi won the men 's 60 hurdles in 7.51 , while France 's Pascal Martinot-Lagarde appeared to injure their leg when dipping for the line to win silver in 7.52 . Czech Petr Svoboda took bronze in 7.53
Olympic shot put bronze medalist Anita Marton of Hungary easily retained their European indoor title with a throw of 19.28 meters , the best in the world this season .
Marton had five throws superior to the 18.36 managed by Bulgaria 's Radoslava Mavrodieva for silver , with Belarusian Yulia Leontyuk secured the bronze medal with 18.32 .
In the men 's pole vault , world-record holder Renaud Lavillenie 's absence with a hamstring injury left the way open for Poland 's Piotr Lisek to win their first gold medal at a major championship .
All three athletes on the podium jumped 5.85 , but Lisek won because they had the fewest missed attempts at earlier heights . The silver went to Konstantinos Filippidis of Greece , with bronze for Pole Pawel Wojciechowski .

Only one Russian athlete , long jumper Darya Klishina , is competing at the championships because of the ongoing suspension of the Russian national team due to widespread doping .
If there 's one thing you can ding the screen for , it 's the mildly differentiated graphics , which are identifiably Ford-based . A better mask , something more in keeping with the rest of the interior design and the unique instrument cluster graphics , would be welcome . If there 's another thing , it 's that the system forces you to use your phone 's maps app when CarPlay is enabled rather than allowing you to choose the vehicle 's navigation system you paid for ( which is n't subject to cell signal strength , either ) . If there 's one more , it 's that messages such as changes to the temperature settings do n't need to momentarily take over the entire screen .
Others might say the door-mounted seat controls are copied from Mercedes-Benz , but there are only so many ways to do seat controls , and that 's not a bad homework assignment to copy from . The same goes for the speaker grilles , which have become de rigueur in modern luxury vehicles .
What the Navigator can not be accused of is that old slander of being a tarted-up Ford . The last Navigator 's interior was a grab bag of Ford parts under a dual-cowl dash , but you have to look hard to find any shared parts now . Even the few you can find , such as the headlight and trailer backup assist knobs , have been trimmed in chrome to look the part . The materials and build quality , both of which are impeccable , are also decidedly not Ford . Every surface you touch and most of the ones you do n't are rich , authentic leathers , wood , and suede . Were I king , the knobs would move with a heavy fluidity like a high-end stereo ( or a Lexus ) , but they make a satisfying click as is . The optional 30-way power seats both look the mid-century modern part and are impressively comfortable . You might not use all 30 functions , but you 'll be able to customize your comfort more precisely than any other car save the Continental ( which also uses them ) . Thankfully , everything from the seat , mirror , pedal , and steering wheel settings to radio presets and climate preferences can be saved in individual profiles , which can even be linked to individual key fobs .

The second row is all mechanical , and as nice as it is , there 's something left on the table there . Oh , the standard captain 's chairs are quite comfortable , and even the optional bench is , too . The middle seat is narrow , and the cushions feel a bit firmer than the outboard seats , but the bench comfortably seats three adults , especially because there 's no hump in the floor . The climate controls on the back of the center console are nicely presented , as are the seat back screens for the optional entertainment system . The drop-down cupholders at the base of the console look surprisingly cheap and flop open in a way you would n't expect with every other moving piece in the interior so well controlled . The Black Label-exclusive rear center console is as classy as the one up front and nicely integrates climate and stereo controls .
What 's missing , and where Lincoln has an opportunity to go further upmarket with future trim levels , is an executive rear-seat package à la the Ranger Rover SV Autobiography and Volvo XC90 . More than a few people will be chauffeured in Navigators , and adding those 30-way seats and a champagne chiller to the second row would really catch some favorable attention .
The third row remains a Navigator strength . It has surprisingly comfortable seats , a flat floor , and lots of head- , shoulder- , knee- , and elbowroom . Third-row passengers even get USB charging ports , but they have to make do with plastic panels everywhere , not leather and wood . No one offers a fancy third row , though , so we ca n't blame Lincoln for that . The seats power flat into the floor for extra cargo space . The second-row seats , meanwhile , tilt and slide forward to create a reasonably large access space to the third row .

With everyone settled in and the Navigator off and moving , we can return our attention to the driver 's seat . Up there , the steering is light and slow , just as you 'd expect in a big luxury yacht . Despite that , the turning circle is shockingly small , even in four-wheel-drive models . Although Lincoln has officially eschewed sportiness in favor of outright luxury and comfort , the Navigator handles surprisingly well . The body rolls far less than you 'd expect , and the motions are well-controlled . When you 're late for the luncheon down the mountain , you 'll have no trouble making up time .
Helping the cause are 450 horsepower and 510 lb-ft behind the mammoth grille . This Raptor-sourced variant of the 3.5-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V-6 makes more than enough power for the nearly 6,000-pound Navigator and delivers it smoothly with surprising linearity . Power is always on tap while cruising , and lag is virtually unnoticeable . The new 10-speed automatic almost always shifts quickly and seamlessly , though we did get two clunky downshifts during our drive , both dropping from second to first . The programming is on point and gives you little reason to use the paddle shifters , so much so that there 's no full manual mode . The piano key push-button shifter takes some getting used to , but it 's a considerably better execution than GMC and Honda 's attempts .
With the asupervisorstioned culture shift from sporty to comfortable , we were let down slightly by the ride quality , an issue we had with the last Navigator . In general , it 's enormously improved and now among the best in the class , but there 's room for improvement . The big wheels and skinny tires feel as though they weigh 1,000 pounds each , transmitting every bump to the cabin and dropping hard into every hole in the road . The CCD adaptive shocks do an admirable job of turning those impacts into soft shudders before they reach the cabin , but on poor pavement , the shudders are almost constant . I 've seen this before in other luxury SUVs and sedans , and the easiest cure is to order the smallest wheel package , which is lighter and tends to come with larger tires , both of which help cushion the ride . It 's a tough trade-off for a product planner because wheels are pretty and tires are n't . People love big wheels because they look good , but they come at a price . I 'd like to see Lincoln go for a full riding-on-clouds feel , but it might require investing in optional air suspension .
Otherwise , there 's even less to complain about with regard to the driving experience . The interior is very quiet , though dull tire noise is a constant presence on less-than-new pavement , and a little wind noise crops up at the tops of the A-pillars on the freeway . The Navigator stops well despite its weight ; it has good brake pedal feel , and the optional driver aids do a good job of keeping the beast between the lines without making too much of a fuss about it .

Keeping an eye on them can be done on the all-digital instrument cluster or the large head-up display , and both have their quirks . The head-up display is bright and unaffected by polarized sunglasses , and the information is presented well , but both models we tested seemed slightly out of focus . All the letters and numbers had fuzzy edges , and no adjustment seemed to help . The instrument cluster is minimalist , and I like the spotlight effect of the speedometer and tachometer , highlighting only the relevant numbers . There is n't as much customization available to you as other Lincoln products , and that 's disappointing . The only real option seems to be turning the tachometer on or off , which shifts things around . When it 's off , there 's a lot of empty space on the left side of the screen , which displays only the name of the song playing . I 've yet to make up my mind about the renamed driving modes , which read like the menu at a day spa , but the animations are pretty .
If some of the criticisms seem especially sharp , it 's because expectations were so high and the delivery was so well-executed in most regards . The 2018 Lincoln Navigator has turned a page . It 's no longer an also-ran . Leaping from the back of the segment to the front , it will undoubtedly be noticed by consumers and the competition . With it coming so far , you ca n't help but root for it to go the next step , too , and really knock the other guys back on their heels . Regardless , it does n't detract from what Lincoln has accomplished . The new Navigator is n't just light years better than the old one . It 's also a serious contender for class leader , and that 's no small feat .

You have probably heard about Justin Carter in passing , maybe on one of the sites you read , or video channels you watch , but it comes down to the fact that a dumb kid said something dumb and because of the world we live in now this entitles the state to steal eight years of your life .
Context is , as they say , important ; part of that context must almost certainly be derived from who happens to be participating in the conversation , what it concerns , and where it is taking place . And even if - taking all of this into account - even if you still feel a compulsion to determine whether a young man in Texas is the next Osama Bin Laden , get a warrant to watch them or turn their house upside down . Do n't throw them in jail for months . Do n't throw them in jail for month , singular . Do n't set bail at a half-mil . Is there something we do n't know ? Something on their computer ? The mind reels . I want there to be a reason . Some reason .
I 'm not exaggerating very much in the second panel of the strip , or the third for that matter . I 've talked about it before . It took me a very long time to figure my shit out , most of it at any rate , and you 've had a front row seat to the rest . If you want to know why people are making big to-do about this that they are , it 's because they know full well that they 'd be in there with him . We used to understand that young people said things they did n't mean , that people leveraged abstraction to expel demons . Euphemism . We are n't safer since we 've adopted this “ be terrified of young men ” stance . Demonstrably .
Shouting fire in a theater is frowned upon because it has lead directly to loss of human lives ; it 's not a “ terroristic threat ” in any case and it 's got nothing to do with this conversation . That 's not why he 's in jail .
We can talk about what “ could have happened ” all fucking day , and that 's generally where people cap out , but just for novelty 's sake we can look at what did happen and what is still happening . They said something dumb about murder , and now he 's in jail learning violence from professionals . God only knows what kind of man will come back out , but we know for certain who made him .

A special education teacher from Sullivan , Indiana is joining a group of students , parents and other Christians in the community who are calling for a prom that bans LGBT people because they say they have no “ purpose in life . ”
WTWO-TV reported that the group met at Sullivan First Christian Church on Sunday to discuss creating a prom that only allowed straight students as an alternative to the inclusive prom at Sullivan High School .
“ We do n't agree with [ homosexuality ] , ” special education teacher Diana Medley told the station . “ It 's offensive to us . ”
Sullivan High School student Kynon Johnson explained that the group want to “ get more people to follow what they believe ” by providing a “ good prom . ”
“ We believe what the Bible says , it says that it 's wrong , ” student Bonnie McCammon insisted . “ And we love the homosexuals , but we do not condone what they 're doing . ”
But not everyone agrees . Jim Davis , a Christian who lives in Sullivan , said that Jesus did not condemn anyone , including LGBT people .
“ He come here to save the world , not to condemn it , ” Davis observed . “ Love them as a person , you do n't have to love what they do because they may not , I mean , the gays may not like the bad things you make mistakes at . ”
Medley , however , disagreed because they believe homosexuality is a choice for LGBT people .
“ I do n't believe they were born that way , ” they opined . “ I think life circumstances made them choose that . I think God made everybody equal… I have kids come to me because of their sexual preference . And they know I do n't agree with it , but care about you . And the same thing for special needs . God puts those people in our life for special reasons . ”
WTWO-TV reporter Paige Preusse asked Medley if they thought “ gay people had some sort of purpose in life . ”
After taking a deep breath , the teacher replied : “ I do n't . I personally do n't . I 'm sorry . I just — I do n't understand it… A gay student or adult or person is n't going to come up is n't going to come up and make some change , unless it 's because they realize , ‘ You know what ? It was a choice and I 'm choosing God . ' ”
Local pastor Bill Phegley remarked that they supported the straight prom movement because Christians in Sullivan were no longer going to be silent about their opposition to homosexuality .
“ Christians have always been prepared for a fight , but Jesus Christ give us armor for the front , not the back , ” Phegley said . “ We are n't running no more . ”
LGBT columnist Dan Savage on Sunday called for people to contact the school system over Medley 's comments .
“ Students with learning disabilities have it hard enough without getting stuck with a mentally challenged special ed teacher , ” Savage wrote . “ Take a good look at the condescending , hateful smirk that spreads across Medley 's face when they were asked if gay people have a purpose in life… and then imagine you 're a gay kid in special ed in Sullivan and this hateful bigot is your teacher . ”
Following publication of Savage 's column , a page supporting the straight prom was removed from Facebook .
By the time of publication of this report , a Change.org petition asking Northeast School Corporation of Sullivan County to fire Medley had almost 800 signatures . A Facebook page supporting diversity at the Sullivan High School prom also had 955 “ likes . ”

Sadly , despite me having spent all Tuesday writing a post about how to do business casual , some readers were disappointed . Some thought sneakers should never be worn with sport coats ; others felt I was n't creative enough with my ideas . One reader wrote : “ these are all just generic blah biz casual uniforms. ” SAD !
To me , this just illustrates the ridiculousness of modern office dress codes . Everyone has to ride this vague line between looking professional and casual , which can mean any number of things depending on where you work . One person will interpret a look as not traditional enough ; another person will see the same thing as being too boring .
Not wanting to disappoint anyone , however , I spent this afternoon coming up with five more ideas on how to dress for the office . Ways that are professional , casual , AND creative – all at the same time .
THE RUFF NECK
True traditionalists do n't stop at suits . Why not bring back a bit of 16th century dress with a ruff ? These elaborate , face-framing collars were once worn by wealthy European men and women alike . An upside of wearing one today : a good , large ruff can catch any dribbles from your Chipotle burrito as you eat alone at your desk . For an affordable option , fashion one from supply-cabinet coffee filters .
AN UPSIDE DOWN TIE
Nothing says professional like a tie , and nothing says creative and casual like wearing it upside down across your face . These actual , real life Thom Browne accessories were made in collaboration with milliner Stephen Jones . Wear two at the same time , like horse blinders , so you never get distracted during client meetings . Currently on sale at SSENSE at 70 % off .
THE LUX DOJO
Good business casual is about looking relaxed and serious at the same time . This jersey robe from Barney 's is styled like a martial arts uniform . One moment , you 're ready to be hand-fed grapes while relaxing on Italian cashmere throws ; the next , you 're about to karate chop your way through Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations . Comes in navy , the most professional of colors .
SWEATER PANTS
In my original post , I recommended wearing an interesting knit as a way to dress down tailored trousers . However , true creativity comes through with swants – a portmanteau of sweaters and pants . Just shove your legs through the sleeves for a hybrid drop-crotch-plus-joggers look , or get them tailored for something more form-fitting ( Stephen West has a guide ) . Worn alone , these are probably too casual for the office , but you can dress them up by wearing a pair of gray flannel trousers over your head ( just be sure to cut a hole for your noggin ) .
A FUCKING CAPE
It 's crazy how fast trends move . Last year , it was all about cloaks ; this year , it 's all about capes . Wear one to the office to show you 're not only a creative professional , but a SUPER creative professional . Pro tip : a poncho is just a cape for your front and back , so cut one in half and you 'll have two back-capes .
CHAPEL HILL , N.C. ( MarketWatch ) — Warren Buffett is not the only investor who publishes a must-read newsletter .
It seems almost sacrilegious to point this out at a time when the rest of the investment community is fawning over Buffett 's latest letter , released over the weekend . But , far from being unique , Buffett 's is part of a long investment-letter tradition .
How far back does that tradition extend ? In the U.S. , it dates at least to the 1800s . The Wall Street Journal itself began as an investment letter in 1883 , when Charles Dow and Edward Jones inaugurated “ The Customer 's Afternoon Letter. ” Dow and Jones changed their service 's name to Wall Street Journal in 1889 . ( Dow Jones also is the publisher of MarketWatch . )
This is more than just a historical curiosity . Of the 200 investment letters whose performance is monitored by the Hulbert Financial Digest , no fewer than 10 have outperformed Buffett over the past 15 years — since the top of the Internet bubble , in other words .
In addition , each of those 10 can boast of something else besides superior performance : They are published at least monthly , if not more frequently . None of them makes you wait a whole year , as Buffett does , to get updated insights .
According to Buffett 's latest report , the 15-year annualized growth rate through 2014 of Berkshire Hathaway 's BRK.B , -0.20 % net asset value is 9.4 % . ( I did the calculations , as Buffett listed calendar-year returns . ) Listed below are the 10 Hulbert Financial Digest-monitored advisers who have bettered that return , in descending order of performance .
“ Nate 's Notes , ” 15-year annualized return : 13.4 % . Editor Nate Pile is an aggressive trader , sometimes employing margin in their recommended model portfolios . In comparing their return to Buffett 's , do n't forget that Buffett 's return is also dependent on margin — funded by the substantial float generated by their insurance operations .
“ Turnaround Letter , ” 15-year annualized return : 12.1 % . Like Buffett , editor George Putnam is a contrarian . They recommend companies that have recently experienced a period of bad news and whose stock prices are depressed .
“ Investment Reporter , ” 15-year annualized return : 11.9 % . Like Buffett , editor Marc Johnson relies for their stock picking on many of the same valuation criteria championed by Benjamin Graham , the father of fundamental analysis .
“ The Prudent Speculator , ” 15-year annualized return : 11.6 % . Editor John Buckingham also is a devotee of Graham 's approach to stock selection .
“ Sound Advice , ” 15-year annualized return : 11.3 % . Editor Gray Cardiff also is a contrarian , searching for out-of-favor value investments .
“ Investor Advisory Service , ” 15-year annualized return : 11.2 % . Editor Douglas Gerlach employs the stock-selection approach promoted by the National Association of Investors Corp. ( NAIC ) , the parent organization of thousands of investment clubs . That approach favors smaller-cap growth stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios .
“ Investment Quality Trends , ” 15-year annualized return : 10.9 % . Editor Kelley Wright also is a contrarian , focusing on relative dividend yield in order to identify the out-of-favor stocks with the greatest potential .
“ The Buyback Letter , ” 15-year annualized return : 10.4 % . Editor David Fried favors the unloved stocks of companies that are actively engaged in repurchasing their shares in the open market .
“ Morningstar StockInvestor , ” 15-year annualized return : 10 % . Like Buffett , and Ben Graham before him , editor Matt Coffina searches for “ companies with established competitive advantages and generous free cash flows , trading at discounts to their intrinsic values . ”
“ Utility Forecaster , ” 15-year annualized return : 9.5 % . Editor David Dittman , who assumed editorship duties two years ago from Roger Conrad , uses fundamental analysis to select stocks of domestic utilities .
Note the significant overlaps that exist between the 10 letters ' stock-picking approaches and Buffett 's . In addition , like Buffett , almost all of them have constructed their model portfolios to be fully invested at all times .
In other words , even in highlighting the 10 newsletters with superior 15-year records to Buffett 's , we need to honor and recognize the superiority of their investment approach . It 's just that you do n't need to look only to Buffett for ways to put that approach into practice .

In the 1996 cinematic achievement `` Happy Gilmore , '' Adam Sandler 's title character — a swashbuckling outsider taking the professional golf circuit by storm — encounters an adoring fan in the gallery . They pull down the collar of their blouse , and Gilmore responds ( naturally ) by signing them chest .
Then , they do it to another , older woman who wants in on the action too . ( Warning : The video below is slightly NSFW . )
On Wednesday night , in the 2016 presidential race , Donald Trump — a swashbuckling outsider taking the Republican primary circuit by storm — did the exact same thing .

This one picture is so packed with stupendousness that we devoted an entire post to breaking it down , person by person . Here 's what we said about that woman :
The look on their face has already launched an Internet phenomenon . ... Amazing . Creepy . Creepily amazing . Amazingly creepy . The sheer joy apparent on their face from being close to a celebrity like Trump is near-perfectly symbolic of our current political culture . Great job .

The mullet

Can you say `` business in the front , party in the back ? '' This dude 's flowing rear locks were so glorious that Trump 's body guards had to avert their eyes . The glow might have blinded them .

No , seriously , you can eat it -- it 's a cake made to look like Trump 's iconically ugly , slogan-bearing hat . I 'd say this woman earned major brownie points , but that would be the wrong dessert item .
I love Trump so much , I put their face on a pumpkin

Yes , the hair is real

Trump 's backers are always there to vouch for him , whether the subject is Muslim celebrations on New Jersey rooftops on 9/11 or that famous hair swoop .
Even Santa Claus loves The Donald

Another bearded guy loves him , too

This is the ultimate double whammy . Trump has not only St. Nick , but also `` Duck Dynasty '' star Willie Robertson on their side , meaning they own the two most important bearded endorsements on planet Earth .
Wade out of second ODI ; confident for India
Australia wicketkeeper Matthew Wade has succumbed to the back injury that ruled them out for the opening match of the Chappell-Hadlee ODI series and will return home from New Zealand later today .
Wade , who was appointed national captain for the series in the absence of Steve Smith and David Warner , injured their back during preparations for the opening encounter in Auckland and had failed to recover in time for Thursday 's second match in Napier .
The Victorian had this morning confirmed their absence from the second ODI , but added that they would stay in New Zealand if they felt the injury improved , in the hope of playing the third match of the series on Sunday . However , it was announced this afternoon that they would in fact return to Melbourne .
Quick wrap : Black Caps hold nerve to win Eden Park epic
Aaron Finch , who stood in for Wade as captain on Monday , will take charge of the two remaining matches in the series , in Napier tomorrow and in Hamilton on Sunday .
No replacement player will be drafted into the squad , meaning Peter Handscomb will keep wickets for the remainder of the series , and young Queensland batsman Sam Heazlett will likely get two further opportunities at international level after their ODI debut on Monday .
After discussions with team support staff today , it was decided the 29-year-old will return to Melbourne for treatment with a view to ensuring they are fit for the Qantas Tour of India , including a pre-series training camp at the International Cricket Council Academy in Dubai .
Super Stoinis sets new all-round benchmark
`` It 's not a major injury but with the short turnaround between matches and the four-and-a-half hour journey by bus to Hamilton for the next match , it 's been decided it 's best for me to go home and get some treatment in Melbourne , '' Wade said .
`` With Dubai and then India I 'd say I 'd definitely be right for that . I 'll get that bit of treatment in Melbourne and we 're hopeful it 'll be fine by Sunday or Monday and I can be on a flight to Dubai and start training pretty much as soon as I hit the ground there . ''
Wade said the same injury – affecting the lower left-hand side of their back and picked up at training while diving during a routine fielding drill – had struck them previously during their career and the resulting recovery had been swift .
Quick Single : Wade said he 'll be right for India
`` It 's happened to me once before , in Ireland a couple of years ago , '' they said . `` I did it the day before the game then and was right to go the next day .
`` This one 's just taken a little bit more time and there 's no reason why that 's happened . Sometimes you recover really quickly and at other times it 's a little slower .
`` It 's heartbreaking I could n't take the field as captain but it has been a real honour to have been appointed captain and to be able to lead the group in the time I 've been here in New Zealand .
`` And after all , it 's all about the team , it 's not about me .
`` Hopefully we can win the next two games and win the series . ''

Defenders 048 : Leshrac February 15 , 2012
So , I 'm trying to acquire a Dota 2 Beta key for a friend . Email me if you have an extra one .
This one goes out to ChiD123 . I think this guy started commenting on the blog , and joined reddit just so they could vote for Leshrac . And vote they did , every day , for like a month or more . There you go , kid . You sure as hell earned this…
Most of you have probably noticed that I 've really slowed down with this project . It 's been a really long journey , and to be honest , I was just getting kind of tired of making them every day . Fear not , I 'm going to continue . I 'm not going to stop until I do every hero in the game . I 've been lucky , in a way . With no updates in the last few weeks , at least I 'm not really “ falling behind ” with the heroes that have been released in the game .
I do n't really have a lot to say about Lesh . He 's a tower killing monster , obviously . I really like their crystalline redesign for Dota 2 .
Oh , and they look a bit like a Abe Lincoln . That is all .

INDIANAPOLIS -- With a smile and `` hello , I 'm Michael Sam , '' the NFL 's first openly gay draft prospect appeared publicly at the league 's scouting combine Saturday .
Sporting a rainbow `` Stand with Sam , '' on their combine gear , the former Missouri defensive end said he 's ready to tackle any and all issues that come with the questions about them as a football player , as well as a football player who happens to be gay .
`` I hope all you guys stand with Sam ... please do , '' Sam said . `` I went to a basketball game against Tennessee , a very kind lady gave it to me . I gave them a hug , I got a lot of support out there . ''
The Missouri football team was honored at halftime of a Missouri-Tennessee basketball game last weekend . Sam received a standing ovation from the crowd in what had been their first public appearance since announcing they are gay .
Sam 's appearance at the combine , as simply DL 42 , is their first face-to-face meeting with their future employers since their ground-breaking announcement . The Southeastern Conference 's co-Defensive Player of the Year said their focus since then has been to get ready for the combine workout as well as their pro day , but he 's prepared for any other issues that may arise .

`` Heck yeah , I wish you guys would tell me , 'Michael Sam , how 's football going ? ' `` Sam said . `` I would love for you to ask me that question , but it is what it is .
`` And I just wish you guys would see me as Michael Sam , the football player , instead of Michael Sam , the gay football player . ''
Sam said Saturday he 's prepared to deal with any prejudice that comes their way as a result of their announcement and that even if the Miami Dolphins were to draft them in the wake of the team 's bullying scandal -- the Wells Report , commissioned by the league , revealed many homophobic slurs from players in the team 's locker room -- they were excited to simply try to earn a spot on an NFL roster .
`` If [ the ] Miami Dolphins drafted me , I would be excited to be a part of that organization , '' Sam said . `` I 'm not afraid about going into that environment . I know how to handle myself , I know how to communicate with my teammates , I know how to communicate with coaches ... and whoever I need to communicate with . ''
DENVER ( JTA ) — I want to challenge one of the mainstay assumptions of organized Jewish life : Jewish continuity is the end goal , and everything is in service of that goal .
It 's been 20 years since the release of the 1990 National Jewish Population Study , which found an unprecedented rate of intermarriage . It launched 1,000 ships of Jewish identity efforts in the service of ensuring Jewish continuity . Indeed , in our current language , everything is in service of Jewish identity . Birthright strengthens Jewish identity . Day schools strengthen Jewish identity . Summer camps strengthen Jewish identity .
Our theory : Strengthen Jewish identity and Judaism will continue .
But here 's the problem with that theory : In our zeal to ensure the Jewish future , we forgot to articulate why it matters for Judaism to continue .
Abraham Joshua Heschel already recognized this in 1965 , when they addressed the 34th General Assembly in Montreal . They said , “ The significance of Judaism does not lie in its being conducive to the mere survival of a particular people , but rather in its being a source of spiritual wealth , a source of meaning relevant to all peoples. ” ( “ Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity ” )
Jews were not placed on this earth to survive . Jews were placed on this earth to embody and to model the quest for “ spiritual wealth ” and “ meaning . ”
Jews , like all people , are searching for meaning , substance and connection . The more we are inundated with e-mails , status updates and tweets , the more we want to go deeper . Our souls are calling out for engagement ; our hearts are crying out to be opened .
Judaism , at its core , is a response to that yearning , an answer to that call . What are we “ continuing ” with our calls for “ continuity ” ? Why does Judaism need a future ? Because Judaism offers a system , a covenantal language , a heritage and tradition that responds to the human need for meaning , substance and connection . It is our system , our language , our heritage ; it is relevant , and that is the reason that we need a Jewish future .
We Jews have a word for the pathway to meaning , substance and connection . It is called Torah . I do n't just mean the Torah scroll that sits alone in the ark , or even just the words of the five books of Moses . I mean the sum total of Jewish sources and texts — the wisdom stored up in our textual heritage .
So often we sideline Torah in the culture of the organized Jewish community . It takes the form of a pithy quote at the top of a website ; an icon on our iPad ; a glazed d'var Torah at the beginning of a board meeting . It 's what we pay lip service to before we really get down to business . But real Torah is so much deeper .
Torah has the power to draw us into the conversation , and to push us to think more deeply about ourselves and our struggles . Torah gives us a language for clarifying our own life 's mission , and an entryway to express our deepest values .
My Dad and I study Torah every week over the phone , and have done so for the past 15 years .
“ When I discuss a text with my son , ” they said , “ I always ask questions to which I do not know the answer . What comes out of these dialogues is a set of novel and exciting ideas which never occurred to me . But my son and I do more than connect with the texts and their moral gems ; we also connect with each other . ”
Torah has the power to push us to ask bold questions and to transform our relationships .
So who is Torah for ? Is the search for meaning and content reserved for a few motivated Jews ? Is it stuck up in the heavens where no one can reach it ? Or across the sea where no one can find it ? ( Deut . 20:12-13 )
There is a radical teaching in Jewish tradition in Midrash Tehilim 65:6 about the moment of revelation at Mount Sinai that addresses that question :
When God spoke the word [ on Sinai ] , God 's voice split into seven voices .
Those seven voices split into the 70 languages of the world
So that everyone could understand .
What 's incredible about this Midrash ? It means that Torah has something to say to everyone . Not just kids . Not just day school graduates . Not just synagogue goers . Not just rabbis . Not even just Jews !
We often assume that Torah is for the elite or only reserved for those with a strong Jewish education . But Torah never understood itself that way . This Midrash recognizes that it is a basic human need to yearn for meaning and substance , and that yearning does n't exclude anyone . Our real birthright , our real morasha , is Torah .
Our task is twofold . First , we have to abandon the old paradigm of Jewish continuity as an end in itself instead . Continuity must be in the service of Torah ; survival must be in service of the deep search for meaning and substance . When we are able to articulate why Judaism matters , why it is critical for us to have a future , then continuity will be the obvious result . In the 21st century , Jews are not inspired to survive just to survive . But we can be inspired to engage in the deepest questions of meaning and existence and do that through the wisdom of our heritage .
Second , we have to make Torah accessible to all . We have to stop imagining Torah as only for the clergy and the elite . We have to stop telling ourselves I do social justice , other people do Torah . We would never limit the quest for pursuit of social justice , or charity , or service , to a few elites . Why do that with Torah ? We suffer and Torah suffers when we short-sell its relevance .
We often have trouble articulating why Judaism matters , and we start casting about for the “ next big idea. ” Torah always has been the big idea . Let 's bring it back to its place of glory , and in so doing , remind ourselves why we care so much about our Jewish future .
Rabbi Elie Kaunfer is the executive director of Mechon Hadar , an egalitarian yeshiva and independent minyan organization . They adapted this Op-Ed from a speech they delivered Nov. 6 to the Jewish Federations of North America 's General Assembly . )
The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of JTA or its parent company , 70 Faces Media .
From the narrow loophole of a machine gun nest , a rebel fighter squinted towards no-man 's land and listened for the whump of artillery and the intermittent crackle of automatic weapon fire .
From these trenches , the war in eastern Ukraine is seen in almost exact mirror image to that in the west : it is the Ukrainians on the other side who started the war ; it is they who are still violating the ceasefire ; and it is the Americans , not the Russians , who are stoking the conflict by arming proxies .
But rebel soldiers here do have one thing in common with rank-and-file Ukrainians a few hundred meters away : an almost complete lack of faith in their enemy 's willingness to fulfil the Minsk peace agreement .
“ The Ukrainians will not keep to the Minsk agreement , we are certain of it - Poroshenko does not want peace , ” said the separatist commander in charge of this stretch of the front line .
It is that deep mistrust that threatens the success of what Angela Merekl called the “ last chance ” to end the war .
A relative lull in violence here in the past few days has raised hopes that there could be peace after all .
Ukraine said on Thursday that it would begin to withdraw heavy artillery out of range of the front , saying it had gone two days without taking casualties - a crucial sign the truce is beginning to work .
The separatists announced the start of their own withdrawal on Tuesday . If both sides keep to the commitment , and the ceasefire holds , the diplomats may be able to work on the next stage of the deal : organising mutually acceptable local elections in a bid to build a lasting settlement .
But the rebel fighters on this stretch of front already blame the Ukrainians for breaking the ceasefire .
“ They have been firing today from an automatic grenade launcher , but we have not answered because we see no point - yet , ” said the commander .
They may have been telling the truth . The sporadic shooting was a fair distance away and it was not possible to tell who was responsible for it .
Several hundred metres from the Ukrainian army 's stronghold in the village of Peski on Donetsk 's northwestern edge , this warren of trenches and machine gun nests was at the centre of ferocious fighting just over a month ago .
As an eight-month battle for the nearby airport approached its climax in January , the Ukrainians desperately resisted all efforts to dislodge them from the village and close the only supply route to the beleaguered garrison in the terminal buildings .
“ Our company was thrown in here and we held it practically surrounded for two and a half months , before the Ukrainians were pushed back and we were properly secured , ” said the rebel commander , who goes by the call-sign “ Zhora . ”
A small business person from Druzhkivka , a town now on the Ukrainian side of the lines , Zhora said they joined the separatist 's nascent army at the beginning of the uprising , after they saw “ the deaths of children ” at the hands of the Ukrainian army in Slavyansk , the rebel 's first stronghold .
Vostok battalion , the unit they joined , has since swollen into a full brigade ( Zhora commands about 130 men in the ninth company of its 3rd battalion ) , and is part of a separatist army that the United States believes is now larger than that of some European states and Nato members .
But as far as the men of the ninth company are concerned , it is the Ukrainians getting foreign help , and it is America , not Russia , that is arming proxies .
“ Look at that , ” said Zhora , presenting the nose cone of some spent ordnance that they said had hit a nearby house . “ It bears latin lettering . There is no way that is from Ukrainian or Russian stocks . So they are definitely getting arms from abroad , ” they said . “ We 've seen them with American weapons - M-16 rifles . Where do you think they got that ? ”
“ It 's all a lot of nonsense this stuff about Russians here . I wear a Russian flag shoulder patch because I like that country , I used to take my holidays there . If there are Russians here they are volunteers . We 're all locals , and we 're fighting for our land . ”
There is evidence of Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine , but it is also true that , contrary to some statements from Kiev , many of the fighters on the separatist side are locals , and fighting for what they see as genuine grievances against the government in Kiev .
“ I joined in summer after they started shelling Donetsk , ” said a fighter called Sergei . “ I had to do something . ”
Like many , Sergei expressed scepticism that the Ukrainians would keep to their side of the peace deal .
But even if Kiev keep to the agreement , the fact is many amongst the separatist rank and file are unhappy with its terms .
In a compromise endorsed and negotiated by the rebels ' key backers in the Kremlin and signed by their local leaders , the peace plan envisages keeping the Donetsk and Luhansk regions inside Ukraine under a decentralisation deal that would grant them significant autonomy .
After ten months of war , however , many front line fighters say that will not be enough . The mantra here is independence or nothing .
Alexander Zakharchenko , the leader of the Donetsk People 's Republic , has repeatedly stated they want full independence , although they have for now accepted the deal signed on February 12 .
“ At a minimum we need all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions . And I will fight until the criminals responsible for this are punished - by that I mean Poroshenko and the politicians who have destroyed Ukraine , ” said Zhora . “ How long will the war go on ? I do n't know . ”
Miss World contest turns ugly : China accused of helping American teen win by blocking hot favourite Miss Norway over diplomatic row
Alexandria Mills , 18 , takes tiara as Norwegians claim Nobel Peace Prize award to Chinese dissident affected result
The Miss World contest was mired in controversy today amid claims that the hot favourite was frozen out because of a diplomatic feud .
American teenager Alexandria Mills was crowned the winner of the 60th anniversary beauty contest on Saturday .
But the 18-year-old Miss USA 's celebrations were tainted by claims that their biggest rival , Miss Norway , was cheated out of the title by the competition 's Chinese hosts .
Queen of all they survey : Alexandria Mills from the United States was a controversial winner of the 60th Miss World Beauty Pageant held in China
Stunning figure : Miss World 2010 Alexandria recently graduated from high school with ambitions to become a teacher
There was no great surprise when Britain 's four contestants failed to make the final cut in the spectacular broadcast to an estimated one billion people around the world .
However , insiders were shocked that stunning 23-year-old Norwegian university graduate Mariann Birkedal - the odds on favourite - did n't even make the top five .
According to reports last night , observers speculated the judges bowed to pressure from Beijing , which is involved in a bitter international spat with Norway .
China is said to be furious after the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prize committee awarded the coveted prize to the jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo earlier this month .
Before the results were announced , Miss Norway was the shortest-priced favourite in Miss World history at 6/5 , while Miss USA lagged behind at 7/1 . Miss England Jessica Linley , a 21-year-old law student from Nottingham , was an even longer 50/1 shot .
Kathrine Sorland , a Norwegian TV personality who came fourth in Miss World 2002 , said they believed China 's fury at the Nobel Peace Prize committee had influenced the outcome .
‘ I was sure they would win , ' they said . ‘ They must have mixed politics and business . Without jumping to conclusions I would stress that Miss World competitions have always been political . And the relations between China and Norway are very strained at the moment . '
Miss Birkedal themselves was more cautious on whether they had been cheated of the crown .
Shock defeat : Odds-on favourite Miss Norway Mariann Birkedal did not even make it into the final five ‘ I have been very careful with speculating about that myself , ' they said .
‘ It is kind of stupid to start thinking that if this or that had not occurred I would perhaps have been Miss World 2010 . I do believe everything happens out of a reason . '
The contest was held in Sanya on China 's tropical Hainan Island for the fifth time in the last eight years .
Vision in white : But Miss Norway missed out on any of the top slots - with many blaming the diplomatic row between their country and China Britain 's Dorset-born Ann Sidney , who won Miss World in 1964 , was on the judge 's panel along with six other former winners . Founded by the late Eric Morley as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations in 1951 , Miss World is the oldest international beauty pageant . It is still run by their widow , Julia , and has a long history of scandals and controversies . This year was no exception . Even before the rumpus over Miss Norway 's early exit , the contest had to be moved from its original site in Vietnam because the location was an ecological heritage zone and local residents had allegedly been forcibly moved from their land .

With China as the host , Taiwan was unable to compete because Beijing does not recognise it as an independent country .
And on Saturday night , the Chinese audience gave Miss Japan the silent treatment , apparently protesting Japan 's claim to the Diaoyu Islands , a group of uninhabited rocks coveted for fishing and mineral rights .
The contest has had its fair share of controversies since its inception .
Then and now : 2010 winner Miss USA , the possible beneficiary of the row between China and Norway over the Nobel Peace Prize award to a Chinese dissident , and Ann Sidney , winner in 1964 , who was a judge this time
The UK 's 1974 winner , Helen Morgan , was forced to resign after four days when they were revealed to be an unmarried mother and the 1980 Miss World , Gabriella Brun , from Germany , had to quit after it was discovered they posed naked for a magazine .
In 2002 , the beauty queens had to flee the host country , Nigeria , after 200 people died in riots which started after a newspaper suggested the Muslim prophet Mohammed would have chosen a wife from one of the contestants had they been alive .

Michael Cuddyer
Cuddyer stunned the Mets in December when they unexpectedly announced they would retire at age 36 , halfway through their two-year , $ 21 million contract . Cuddyer was dogged by injuries in the final seasons of their 15-year career , and they made their decision to retire shortly after undergoing surgery in November to repair a core muscle injury .
`` I just knew I was n't going to be able to give what I expect myself to give out on the field , '' Cuddyer told reporters . `` I knew I could still bring leadership , and still bring qualities that can contribute . But I take a lot of pride in playing the game the right way , and playing the game the way that I know I was capable of playing . I did n't feel like I could bring that anymore . And with great humility , I made the decision . ''

Ken Griffey Jr .
Griffey shocked the baseball world when they suddenly retired at age 40 on June 2 , 2010 , during their second stint with the Mariners .
A 13-time All-Star with 630 career home runs , Griffey was batting .184 with no homers and seven RBIs when they announced their retirement in a statement released through the Mariners . Afterward , the future Hall of Famer got in their car and drove home to Orlando , Fla. , in a bizarre end to a 22-year career .
Griffey said to The Seattle Times that they previously had told Mariners management `` that if I become a distraction or feel that I would be a distraction , then I would retire , because that 's the one thing that I did n't want . ''

Gil Meche
Meche walked away from the $ 12 million remaining on their contract with the Royals when they retired in January 2011 following a 10-year career as a starting pitcher . For Meche , the decision was not about finances but rather their doubts that their cranky right-shoulder would hold up through another season .
`` A lot of people might think I 'm crazy for not trying to play and make this amount of money , '' Meche told reporters , `` [ but ] I do n't think I 'm going to regret it . ''
Mark McGwire
McGwire hinted at retirement after the Cardinals were eliminated from the 2001 postseason , telling reporters , `` It comes down to what I can do physically . My body is pretty worn out . And my mind is definitely worn out . ''
A few weeks later on a Sunday night in November , McGwire faxed their letter of resignation to Rich Eisen of ESPN , who broke the news on SportsCenter .
McGwire was 38 at the time of their retirement and walked away from a two-year , $ 30 million extension with the Cardinals . The slugger ended their 16-year career with 583 homers .

Mike Schmidt
Schmidt stunned those closest to them when they retired at age 39 on May 28 , 1989 , midway through a West Coast road trip with the Phillies . The future Hall of Famer was mired in a slump and had been contemplating retirement , when suddenly an omen appeared .
Schmidt booted a routine grounder in a tie game against the Giants , and the next batter hit a grand slam .
`` Mentally , I had sort of been thinking about it , '' Schmidt recalled to the Philadelphia Inquirer . `` 'Might this be the end ? What other sign do I need ? ' I was looking for a jumping-off point . ... After the game , I walked into the clubhouse and it was like I was in a fog . I showered real fast , paid the clubhouse guy and went out and sat on the bus all by myself for 30 or 40 minutes to contemplate my next move . ''

Sandy Koufax
Koufax made a surprise announcement about their retirement at age 30 on Nov. 18 , 1966 , following another stellar season with the Dodgers that saw them win the National League Cy Young Award for the third time in four seasons and help their team reach the World Series .
Koufax 's decision to hang up their spikes came as a result of chronic arthritis in their pitching arm that they felt could be further damaged by continuing to pitch . Following their retirement , Koufax became the youngest player ever to be inducted into the Hall of Fame at age 36 .

Lou Gehrig
In perhaps the most well-known speech in North American sports history , Gehrig announced their retirement before a packed house at Yankee Stadium on July 4 , 1939 .
The Yankees were honoring Gehrig between games of a doubleheader against the Washington Senators , only two months after the future Hall of Famer found out they had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) .
Following a lengthy ceremony featuring numerous gifts and speeches from New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia , Yankees manager Joe McCarthy and Gehrig 's old pal , Babe Ruth , it was time for The Iron Horse to address the crowd of 61,000 .
`` Fans , for the past two weeks you have been reading about a bad break I got , '' Gehrig said into the microphones at home plate . `` Yet today , I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth . ''

Austin Laymance is a reporter for MLB.com .
Democrats continued to distance themselves from Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein Sunday , following reporters that the filmmaker repeatedly sexually harassed their female employees . Weinstein had been a prolific campaign donor to the party .
Asked if they would return donations from the mogul , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , told NBC on Sunday they were not certain they had received any money from Weinstein .
When they were told records showed they had received donations from Weinstein , the senator replied , `` I just do n't know , '' adding Weinstein had done `` mighty wrong '' before reciting their record on women 's issues .
`` No one has ever questioned where I stand on any of this stuff . So , when somebody comes to you and says , 'Oh , they contributed to you . Are you giving back the money ? ' You sort of look like a startled bird and say , 'Well , let me look and see . ' And that is the best I can do for you today , '' Feinstein said .
Sen. Chris Murphy , D-Conn. , another recipient of donations from Weinstein , told CNN on Sunday they would `` probably '' return the funds .
`` This is a pretty bad guy who did some really awful things and if people need for that money to be returned in order to make it clear that the entities that received them want nothing to do with them and their behavior , then that 's probably a smart move , '' Murphy said .
The New York Times reported last week at least eight settlements had been paid to women who alleged sexual harassment by Weinstein , co-founder of Miramax , the studio that produced such hits as `` Pulp Fiction '' and `` Chicago . ''
The report alleged Weinstein used their position to demand sexual favors from the women , in one case pressuring a woman to give them a nude massage . Weinstein 's behavior was apparently an open secret in Hollywood .
Weinstein attributed their behavior to having grown up `` in the ‘ 60s and '70s , when all of the rules about behavior and workplaces were different . ''
The report prompted several prominent Democrats such as Sen. Pat Leahy , D-Vt. , to return donations from Weinstein . According to the Center for Responsive Politics , the movie mogul has donated more than $ 1.4 million to the party since 1990 .
Leonid Ivanovich Kupriyanovich ( Russian : Леони́д Ива́нович Куприяно́вич , 14 July 1929 – 1 January 1996 ) was a Soviet engineer from Moscow who is credited for early development of a mobile phone device .
Historical facts [ edit ]
In 1955 Leonid Kupriyanovich published the description of a simple walkie-talkie amateur radio station for personal use in the Soviet amateur radio magazine `` Radio , '' 1955 , N2 . It operated on two vacuum tubes . The walkie-talkie weighed about 1.2 kg and had 1.5 km operating distance .
In 1957 Leonid Kupriyanovich presented a micro walkie-talkie radio version the size of a matchbox , 50g in weight and had 2 km operating distance .
Also in 1957 they made an experimental model of a wearable automatic mobile phone ( `` radiophone '' ) , called LK-1 ( not to be confused with the cancelled Soviet spacecraft of the same name or LK-1 ( ЛК-1 ) the first Soviet trolleybus ) . Their device consisted of a base station and a portable handset . LK-1 was 3 kg in weight , 20–30 km operating distance , and 20–30 hours of battery life . Leonid Kupriyanovich patented this mobile phone in 1957 ( author 's certificate № 115494 , 1.11.1957 ) . The base station , in accordance with author 's description , could serve several customers . In 1958 , Kupriyanovich made the new experimental `` pocket '' model mobile phone . This phone had 0.5 kg weight . To serve more customers , Kupriyanovich proposed the device , named it as a correllator . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
In 1961 Leonid Kupriyanovich presented a pocket automatic radio phone which could fit in the palm of a hand . This pocket mobile phone weighed only 70 g and had 80 km operating distance . Kupriyanovich told correspondents of the АПН news agency that in the USSR the production of this device was planned . They also reported the plans for the construction in Moscow of ten base stations for creation of a mobile communication network . The first station in Moscow was planned to be constructed in Mazilovo . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
In the 1960s Leonid Kupriyanovich began to develop electronic sets for hypnopedia and researched methods of how to `` write '' information into the human memory . Their electronic set `` Rhytmoson '' was manufactured in the USSR and purchased for medical purposes .

This is great . In a recent interview with Metal Hammer UK , Cannibal Corpse vocalist and legend Corpsegrinder got to talking about their massive neck – which is the stuff of legend in itself . The photo above says it all . Anyways , without further adieu , here 's what they had to say about the muscle melded underneath their head :
“ Well , it 's just from headbanging and lifting weights when I was younger , ” they said . “ My dad had a business where they did painting , roofing and everything , so I 'd work with them all day long . After that , we 'd go to fishing spots to catch and eat all these fish . Then I 'd jog over to my friend 's house , who lived about a mile away , and we 'd lift weights . If you compare old pictures from when I was in VILE to now , it 's obviously grown and the only thing I 've really done since is headbanging , which must be fairly similar to weightlifting . ”
Asked if they have ever had their neck measured , like if they had to get a tuxedo to go to a wedding or something , Fisher said , “ Maybe when I got married in '98 , but I do n't remember and it 's bigger now . If you really look at it , it 's bigger than the base of my head or where my ears are . A friend of mine once said , ‘ You do n't have a head , you 're a neck with lips . ' A lot of security guys will come up to me and complain about working out , but having skinny necks , and ask how I do it . I tell them to listen to [ SLAYER 's ] ‘ Reign In Blood ' and headbang the whole way through after working out . ”

Reading startup news can be a bit intimidating sometimes . You learn about all these 20-somethings who raised millions of capital and who already employ hundreds of people . If you are above 30 and you sometimes feel like a looser , we have some good news for you ! Some of the best entrepreneurs of our time actually had accomplished almost nothing ( from an entrepreneurial standpoint ) before the age of 32 or beyond . Here are 10 examples :
Jan Koum , WhatsApp : Before creating WhatsApp , the Ukrainian-American entrepreneur Jan Koum applied to work at Facebook . They rejected him . Jan is a San Jose State college dropout . After leaving school , they landed a gig at Yahoo where they met their cofounder Brian Acton . After nine years at Yahoo , Koum wanted to join Facebook but it did n't work out . Koum incorporated WhatsApp when they were 33 . A few years later , WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook for $ 19 Billion .
Lynda Weinman , Lynda.com : When Linda Weinman was 37 , they started teaching web design at a college in Pasadena , and wrote a book about it . With $ 20,000 in book profits , Weinman and their husband launched a online design school . Lynda Weinman started Lynda.com when they were 40-years-old . 13 years later they sold the company to Linkedin for $ 1.5 billion . At that time Lynda was already over 60 years old . They once are dubbed “ the grandma of the internet ” .
Jack Ma , Alibaba : Jack Ma failed their college entrance exam three times . They also applied about 10 times at Harvard , but was rejected . Jack started their career working as an english teacher . In the beginning of their career , Jack applied to over 30 different jobs , including KFC , and again , they were rejected . At 35 , Jack Ma founded Alibaba . Alibaba did n't make any profit in its first three years , but today Jack Ma is one of the richest people in the world with a net worth of more than $ 30 billion .
Ben Horowitz , LoudCloud : After graduating from UCLA in 1988 and hopping from job to job for seven years , 29-year-old Ben Horowitz started to work for Netscape . After Netscape was acquired in 1999 , Horowitz and Marc Andreessen teamed up to to start LoudCloud . Horowitz was 33-years-old . Loudcloud was acquired for $ 1.6 billion in cash when Ben Horowith was 41 . Today he 's running the well-known Silicon Valley-based VC firm Andreessen Horowitz .
Mark Cuban , MicroSolutions : Mark 's first job ( aside of working as a bartender ) was selling computers for $ 18,000 a year . After being fired from that job , Cuban started the consultancy company MicroSolutions . 28-year-old Mark Cuban shared a three-bedroom apartment with five people . Their bedroom was in the closet . At the age of 32 Cuban sold MicroSolutions for $ 6 million – enough to start Broadcast.com , which they sold for $ 5.7 billion . Today they own the basketball club Dallas Mavericks .
Xochi Birch , Bebo : Before Facebook came along , Bebo was one of the largest social networks in Europe . It was founded in 2005 by Michael and Xochi Birch . In 2008 , when Bebo counted more than 40 million users , the social network was acquired by AOL for $ 850 million . Xochi was 36 at that time . The couple netted a about $ 595 million . In retrospect , this acquisition is considered one of the biggest blunders in tech history . In 2013 , under AOL 's control and after the Birch 's were long gone , Bebo went bankrupt . The Birch 's bought it back for $ 1 million .
Riccardo Zacconi , King.com : After leaving university with a bachelor degree , Zacconi worked as a consultant for many years . At the start of the dotcom boom , Zacconi joined the Swedish online messaging startup Spray before it was acquired by Lycos Europe in 2000 . In 2001 , Zacconi left Spray and moved to the UK to become VP of European sales and marketing at uDate . They left this company shortly after its merger with Match.com and in 2003 , at the age of 35 they co-founded King Digital Entertainment , becoming the CEO .
Caterina Fake , Flickr : Caterina Fake started their career at a web development agency . At 28-years-old , they accepted the role of Art Director for Salon.com . In 2002 they launched Ludicorp , a company that created a multi-player video game . But after months of failed fundraising and bankruptcy concerns , Fake decided to scrap the game . They launched Flickr instead . At that time , Fake was 33 years old . Three years later they sold it to Yahoo ! for $ 30 million . In 2009 , Fake co-founded Hunch , which eBay acquired for $ 80 million . By the way : Caterina 's husband is the founder of slack .
Tim Westergren , Pandora : Before starting Pandora , Westergren was a failed musician , part-time composer and nanny . Although they started Pandora ( his first entrepreneurial endeavor ) at 35 , Pandora did n't become an online radio channel until Westergren was 37 . The company sold hardware that allowed stores to play music . Pandora even went bankrupt in their first two years and Westergren somehow convinced 50 employees to work without pay for almost two years .
Arianna Huffington , The Huffington Post : Arianna Huffington first came to public attention in 1994 , when their husband , the Republican Michael Huffington , ran for Senate . In their youth Arianna authored several books , including a biography of Pablo Picasso . However , Arianna Huffington did n't hit it big on their own until their mid-50s . Arriana was 55 when they launched The Huffington Post and 61-years-old when they sold it to AOL for $ 315 million . Now at the age of 66 , Arianna Huffington just left the Huffington Post to work on a new startup .
Jackie Chan was sick and tired of trying to cross over into American movies . The martial arts wonder and ex-Bruce Lee stuntman was a superstar in their native China , but their attempts at going Hollywood in films like Big Brawl ( 1980 ) , The Cannonball Run ( 1981 ) , and The Protector ( 1985 ) barely registered with stateside audiences . “ Nobody knew who this little Chinese guy was that spoke no English , ” Chan told Yahoo Entertainment during a recent Role Recall interview ( watch clip above ) . “ I was disappointed [ and thought ] , ‘ No more American market . ' ”
In the late 1990s , their manager pleaded with them to make one more go at it : There was this project called Rush Hour , in which Chan would play a Hong Kong police inspector who teams up with a wise-cracking LAPD detective ( Chris Tucker ) to rescue a Chinese politician 's kidnapped daughter . Chan agreed to do the Brett Ratner-directed 1998 action comedy in large part because it allowed them to speak in broken English .
After Chan wrapped Rush Hour , they told their manager they would never do another film like it again . “ That 's a terrible movie , ” Chan recounted saying . “ They do n't allow me to do my own style [ of action ] . The English , I 'm not good . Chris Tucker 's English , I do n't understand . Terrible movie ! ” They sat there dumbfounded as moviegoers laughed through the premiere . “ Why are they laughing , I just do n't understand , ” they thought .
So Chan , now 63 , returned to Asia to work once again in their home region , when they got the call : Rush Hour was a massive hit . Released in Sept. 1998 , it earned $ 141 million at the U.S. box office and $ 244 million worldwide .
It also leads to two sequels… and two more hits : 2001 's Rush Hour 2 , Chan 's highest grossing of all time ( $ 226 million in the U.S. , $ 347m worldwide ) and 2007 's Rush Hour 3 ( $ 140 million in the U.S. , $ 258m worldwide ) .
“ Slowly , slowly , they 're [ brought ] me to Hollywood again , ” Chan said . “ Now slowly [ I 've been understanding ] American culture . [ I 'll ] try to stay as long as possible . ”
Jackie Chan can currently be seen in The Foreigner , in theaters now .

Cesc Fabregas has finally admitted they threw the pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson during the ‘ Battle of the Buffet ' .
It is a tale that has entered footballing folklore . Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford on October 24 , 2004 on a record 49-match unbeaten run . They went on to lose a tempestuous game 2-0 .
The sides clashed in the tunnel , and , in a tale that had never been confirmed , Fabregas was alleged to have thrown a slice of pizza at the Manchester United manager .
SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO
Cesc Fabregas has admitted they were the culprit behind the Battle of the Buffet in 2004
They were asked by host James Corden whether it was them who famously threw the pizza
The incident in the tunnel followed a tense encounter between Arsenal and Manchester United
Ashley Cole wrote in their autobiography : ‘ All eyes turned and all mouths gawped to see this pizza slip off that famous puce face and roll down their nice black suit . '
Ferguson previously said : ‘ They say it was Cesc Fabregas who threw the pizza at me , but to this day I have no idea who the culprit is . '
Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown hinted at the assailant , commenting : ‘ From what I understand , it was a Spanish fella with great technique .
‘ Even when it came to the pizza they had great technique . They threw it like a Frisbee . '
MARTIN KEOWN : THESE GAMES WERE UTTERLY FEROCIOUS Sorry Cesc , I was n't at Old Trafford when you flung the pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson ... but I wish I had been ! Often memories of these titanic clashes merge into one . Maybe they assumed that because there was a melee I must have been there , but I had already left Arsenal for Leicester . There was always an added emphasis when we played Manchester United . We knew if we took three points off them , we would have an excellent season . These were two teams at the peak of their powers . United won the Treble in 1999 but that year , head-to-head , I felt we were as good if not better than them . Where they had the edge was their ability to beat everyone else . Such was their psychological hold over the rest of the Premier League that to beat them you had to play them at their own game . I remember seeing Sir Alex give the referee the hairdryer treatment during United 's victory over us in the 1999 FA Cup semi-final . From then on , it was always in the back of my mind that I needed to intervene if I saw them go near the officials . United 's players also had a habit of crowding the referee and I wanted to make sure we matched their numbers . In these games , you could not afford to get embroiled in personal vendettas . But with such strong-willed individuals on both sides it was inevitable that tempers would flare . In the 801 games I played for club and country I only saw punches thrown in the tunnel on two or three occasions — and one of them was during a game between Arsenal and United . But when I look back , there was always a level of respect between us . United beat us in the FA Cup semi-final in 2004 , six months after I had clashed with Ruud van Nistelrooy at Old Trafford . I saw them in the tunnel before the game and told them that the incident had not been personal . I 'd simply been caught up in the heat of a battle between two great adversaries .
And now , while making an appearance on Sky 's A League of Their Own , the Chelsea midfielder has confirmed they were the culprit .
In tonight 's episode , host James Corden asks Fabregas : ‘ Tonight , can we finally put the case of the flying pizza to bed once and for all ? Were you the culprit who threw the pizza ? '
The 30-year-old immediately replies , ‘ Yes ! ' , before going into the story : ‘ Martin Keown is a liar because I saw them in front of me just , like , punching people so they did n't see anything .
Fabregas said that they had thrown the pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson , confirming a legendary tale
Host Corden seemed to enjoy the story , which ended long-running speculation over Fabregas
‘ All of a sudden , I heard noises and I thought what 's happening ? So I go out with my slice of pizza and I saw Sol Campbell , Rio Ferdinand , Martin Keown ... everyone pushing each other .
‘ I was like , I want to get in , but I do n't know how to and I threw ... peeew ... just threw it . Once I saw it was hitting , like , who it was hitting , which I did n't mean ... '
Fabregas then turns to the camera on the show and adds : ‘ I apologise Sir Alex , really did n't mean to do that . ' When asked by Jamie Redknapp where the pizza hit Ferguson , Fabregas tapped the side of their face .
Fabregas laughed as they suggested the pizza had hit Ferguson square on their cheek
Arsenal went on to lose the game at Old Trafford , ending their undefeated run at 49 matches
Fabregas went on to apologise to Ferguson for their role in the incident at Old Trafford
ALEX FERGUSON ON INCIDENT FERGUSON : 'Ruud van Nistelrooy came in to the dressing room and complained that Wenger had been giving them stick as they left the pitch . Right away I rushed out to say to Arsene : 'You leave my players alone . ' They were incensed at losing the game . That was the reason for their combative behaviour . 'You should attend to your own players ' , I told him . They were livid . Their fists were clenched . I was in control , I knew it . 'The next thing I knew I had pizza all over me . We put food into the away dressing room after every game . Pizza , chicken . Most clubs do it . Arsenal 's food was the best . They say it was Cesc Fabregas who threw the pizza at me but to this day , I have no idea who the culprit was . '
MATCH FACTS Man Utd : Carroll , Gary Neville , Ferdinand , Silvestre , Heinze , Ronaldo ( Smith 85 ) , Phil Neville , Scholes , Giggs , Rooney , Van Nistelrooy ( Saha 90 ) Subs Not Used : Howard , Brown , Miller Booked : Gary Neville , Phil Neville Goals : Van Nistelrooy 73 ( pen ) , Rooney 90 Arsenal : Lehmann , Lauren , Campbell , Toure , Cole , Ljungberg , Vieira , Edu , Reyes ( Pires 70 ) , Bergkamp , Henry . Subs Not Used : Van Persie , Taylor , Fabregas , Cygan Booked : Cole , Vieira , Edu Attendance : 67,862 Referees : M Riley ( W Yorkshire )
The game itself came a year after the famed Battle of Old Trafford , which ended in a 0-0 draw after Ruud van Nistelrooy missed a late penalty for United before being aggressively surrounded by Arsenal players .
During the 2004 match two United players could have been sent off . Van Nistelrooy raked their studs on Cole 's ankle before Rio Ferdinand escaped punishment despite denying a clear goalscoring opportunity .
The tension intensified after Wayne Rooney theatrically fell over Sol Campbell 's leg in the Arsenal box .
Van Nistelrooy dispatched the penalty before a 19-year-old Rooney sealed the points with a close range strike late on . The two managers confronted each other after Wenger angrily spoke to Van Nistelrooy at the final whistle .
Soon the players became involved . Cole says some shouted , ‘ you cheats ' at the United squad . Phil Neville remembers ‘ handbags ' between the two sides .
Suddenly , Ferguson had pizza thrown at him . United had provided the away dressing room with food . Cole recalls escaping to the dressing room and everyone on the Arsenal side laughing at the incident .

Choice Provisions , developer of the Bit.Trip series , announced the next game in its Commander Video-starring platformer series today : Runner 3 . The studio did n't provide much in the way of detail on the follow-up to Bite.Trip Runner 2 , but did release a short teaser trailer and a release window for the game ; it 's coming in 2017 .
In a press release , Choice Provisions said Runner 3 will feature `` friends both old and new '' and will be the studio 's `` biggest and most ambitious game yet . '' On the game 's website , Choice Provisions wrote more about its plans for Runner 3 , specifically how the team is approaching the game 's difficulty .
Too often , games focus on rewarding hardcore players and perpetuating the idea that if you play on easy , you 're somehow less of a gamer . What if games do n't bring you as much joy if they 're ultra-challenging ? Maybe that does n't make you `` less '' . Maybe that just makes you `` you '' . So in Runner3 , we 're focusing on bringing our notions of difficulty and what makes a game rewarding front and center . The focus in Runner3 is on giving the player a joyous experience . In fact , one of our development pillars for the game is : `` Runner3 needs to be a joyous experience in every moment -- both in the game , and during its creation . '' If you like being challenged relentlessly , will you get that ? Yes . ( It is us , after all . ) But if you prefer being able to experience the entire game without being ultra-challenged , you 'll be able to do that as well -- without penalty .
The developer did n't announce platforms for the game , though the Bit.Trip Runner games typically come to a variety of console , handheld and PC platforms .
Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough is the most powerful person in Washington few have heard of .
As the Senate 's chief procedural referee , they will decide how much of President Trump 's agenda can pass without any Democratic votes .
GOP leaders plan to pass legislation reforming the nation 's healthcare system and overhauling the tax code through special “ budget ­reconciliation ” rules that would prevent a Democratic filibuster .
Republican senators are also looking at scrapping pieces of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act through the use of the same rules .
Their success may largely come down to MacDonough .
“ The parliamentarian makes the calls , ” said former Sen. Kent Conrad ( D-N.D. ) , who worked with MacDonough in 2010 when Democrats passed a major revision to the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ She 's able to say what can be voted on with a simple majority versus what requires a supermajority , so this gives the parliamentarian extraordinary influence on the outcome , ” Conrad said .
Because they can avoid the filibuster , the budget rules are powerful . But there are major restrictions on their use because of a six-part test in the Senate known as the Byrd Rule , after the late Sen. Robert Byrd ( D-W.Va. ) .
Democrats plan to challenge the GOP by asking MacDonough to make decisions on the most subjective part of the Byrd Rule : whether the budgetary impact of a provision passed under reconciliation is “ merely incidental ” to its nonbudgetary impact .
If MacDonough rules that a part of a GOP bill has a merely incidental budgetary impact , it would have to be removed from the legislation .
Parts of the ObamaCare bill approved by the House , for example , will almost certainly be ruled out of bounds , senators in both parties have acknowledged .
This could force Republicans to strip out large portions of the House bill , including provisions central to its passage last week . And that could make it harder for the GOP to get a final bill to Trump 's desk .
MacDonough took over as Senate parliamentarian , becoming the first woman to do so , in February 2012 , when Democrats controlled the Senate under Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidBottom Line Brennan fires back at 'selfish ' Trump over Harry Reid criticism Trump rips Harry Reid for 'failed career ' after ex-Dem leader slams them in interview MORE ( D-Nev. ) . They were promoted by Secretary of the Senate Nancy Erickson but never talked to Reid about the job .
Hired as an assistant parliamentarian in 1999 , when Republicans controlled the chamber , MacDonough served as senior assistant parliamentarian from 2002 to 2012 .
They grew up in Maryland before moving to Connecticut at age 13 and later graduated from George Washington University in 1988 . They started their career in on Capitol Hill in 1990 as a Senate library aide , later working in the executive clerk 's office and as an assistant editor for the Congressional Record .
They attended Vermont Law School , and after graduating in 1998 , worked briefly as an assistant district counsel for the Department of Justice in Newark , N.J. , handling immigration cases .
They are respected by Senate Democrats and Republicans alike .
Don Stewart , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellHouse to push back at Trump on border Democrats block abortion bill in Senate Overnight Energy : Climate protesters storm McConnell 's office | Center-right group says Green New Deal could cost trillion | Dire warnings from new climate studies MORE 's ( R-Ky. ) deputy chief of staff , praised MacDonough as “ a brilliant lawyer , a thorough and fair referee , and a walking encyclopedia of Senate precedent and procedure .
“ The Senate is fortunate to have their guidance and advice , ” they said .
That respect may be tested in the coming months .
The parliamentarian is supposed to stay above the fray of politics in order to give clear-cut decisions on Senate rules .
But some conservatives have tried to raise questions about MacDonough 's impartiality .
Philip Wegmann , a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner , wrote in March that MacDonough 's “ politics are a bit questionable , ” asserting that they advised former Vice President Al Gore Albert ( Al ) Arnold GoreOvernight Energy : Trump ends talks with California on car emissions | Dems face tough vote on Green New Deal | Climate PAC backing Inslee in possible 2020 run New climate PAC will back Inslee for president Howard Schultz must run as a Democrat for chance in 2020 MORE in their legal battle with George W. Bush after the 2000 presidential election . They cited a profile published by Vermont Law School , where they received their degree .
MacDonough , however , never played a partisan role after the 2000 election . Instead , they had advised Gore in their capacity at the time as the ex officio president of the Senate during a joint session of Congress while it counted electoral ballots from the 2000 election .
Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael ( Ted ) Edward CruzTrump unleashing digital juggernaut ahead of 2020 Inviting Kim Jong-un to Washington Trump endorses Cornyn for reelection as O'Rourke mulls challenge MORE ( R-Texas ) has reminded colleagues that the parliamentarian only advises the presiding chair on the Senate 's precedent and the presiding chair can disregard that advice in ruling on a pending question — though this view has n't gained any traction within the Senate Republican Conference .
Cruz argued in The Wall Street Journal in March that a full repeal of ­ObamaCare and its mandates should be possible with a simple majority because “ the Senate parliamentarian does not ultimately determine what is allowable under reconciliation . ”
So far , McConnell has n't given any indication that they would do that , but even some Republican senators warn that after McConnell set a new precedent to deny the minority party the power to filibuster Supreme Court nominees , no rule or tradition is safe .
In 2001 , then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R-Miss . ) fired Robert Dove , who was serving as the parliamentarian at the time , after Dove ruled against the broader interpretation of the budget rules that Republicans were pushing to pass Bush 's tax plan .
Republicans at the time wanted to pass several tax bills under reconciliation , but Dove advised they could only move one .
MacDonough has weighed in on healthcare and budget reconciliation before .
In 2015 , they said a reconciliation vehicle passed by House Republicans to tear down the pillars of ObamaCare needed to be rewritten to accommodate the Senate 's rules .
GOP senators revised language repealing the individual and employer mandates to instead zero out the tax penalties of not complying with them — thereby rendering them toothless while staying in compliance with the Byrd Rule .
Another problem posed by the Byrd Rule is that it requires legislation passed under reconciliation to not increase the deficit beyond the budget window , which is the period of time the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) uses to score the cost of legislation . That window is almost always 10 years .
This could be an issue when Congress moves to tax reform . The Joint Committee on Taxation notified Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanBrexit and exit : A transatlantic comparison Five takeaways from McCabe 's allegations against Trump The Hill 's 12:30 Report : Sanders set to shake up 2020 race MORE ( R-Wis. ) earlier this year that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent could dramatically shorten the lifespan of the tax cut .
The committee estimated that cutting the corporate rate for only three years would result in a “ nonnegligible revenue loss ” beyond the 10-year window because companies would carry forward tax credits beyond the next decade .
MacDonough 's power largely comes from being a defender of the Senate as an institution .
“ She sets the guardrails for how the Senate can proceed . She 's the interpreter of what they 've done in the past , ” said Sarah Binder , a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
“ She 's a huge repository of knowledge and information about what 's been done in the past but also the interpreter of what 's kosher and what 's not kosher , ” they added .
Circumventing the parliamentarian would be going down a slippery slope to eliminating the filibuster altogether , said Sam Wice , an attorney and former CBO staffer .
“ Reconciliation would be the tip of the iceberg . It 's likely that most of the talk would shift to getting rid of the filibuster , ” Wice said .
Mike Nudelman/Business Insider The following op-ed was exclusively provided to Business Insider to coincide with a speech Bill Gates is giving for the Munich Security Conference . The following is an abridged version of their remarks .
When I decided 20 years ago to make global health the focus of my philanthropic work , I did n't imagine that I 'd be speaking at a conference on international security policy . But I 'm speaking here at the Munich Security Conference because I believe our worlds are more tightly linked than most people realize .
War zones and other fragile state settings are the most difficult places to eliminate epidemics . They 're also some of the most likely places for them to begin—as we 've seen with Ebola in Sierra Leone and Liberia , and with cholera in the Congo Basin and the Horn of Africa .
It 's also true that the next epidemic could originate on the computer screen of a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create a synthetic version of the smallpox virus . . . or a super contagious and deadly strain of the flu .
The point is , we ignore the link between health security and international security at our peril . Whether it occurs by a quirk of nature or at the hand of a terrorist , epidemiologists say a fast-moving airborne pathogen could kill more than 30 million people in less than a year . And they say there is a reasonable probability the world will experience such an outbreak in the next 10-15 years .
Business Insider/Skye Gould
It 's hard to get your mind around a catastrophe of that scale , but it happened not that long ago . In 1918 , a particularly virulent and deadly strain of flu killed between 50 million and 100 million people .
You might be wondering how likely these doomsday scenarios really are . The fact that a deadly global pandemic has not occurred in recent history should n't be mistaken for evidence that a deadly pandemic will not occur in the future .
And even if the next pandemic is n't on the scale of the 1918 flu , we would be wise to consider the social and economic turmoil that might ensue if something like Ebola made its way into a lot of major urban centers .
The good news is that with advances in biotechnology , new vaccines and drugs can help prevent epidemics from spreading out of control . And , most of the things we need to do to protect against a naturally occurring pandemic are the same things we must prepare for an intentional biological attack .
We need to invest in vaccine innovation
First and most importantly , we have to build an arsenal of new weapons—vaccines , drugs , and diagnostics .
Vaccines can be especially important in containing epidemics . But today , it typically takes up to 10 years to develop and license a new vaccine . To significantly curb deaths from a fast-moving airborne pathogen , we would have to get that down considerably—to 90 days or less .
We took an important step last month with the launch of a new public-private partnership called the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations . The hope is that CEPI will enable the world to produce safe , effective vaccines as quickly as new threats emerge .
The really big breakthrough potential is in emerging technology platforms that leverage recent advances in genomics to dramatically reduce the time needed to develop vaccines . Basically , they create a delivery vehicle for synthetic genetic material that instructs your cells to make a vaccine inside your own body . And the great thing is that once you 've built a vaccine platform for one pathogen , you can use it again for other pathogens—which means we could also apply it to other hard-to-treat diseases like HIV , malaria , and tuberculosis .
Of course , the preventive capacity of a vaccine wo n't help if a pathogen has already spread out of control . Because epidemics can quickly take root in the places least equipped to fight them , we also need to improve surveillance .
That starts with strengthening basic public health systems in the most vulnerable countries . We also have to ensure that every country is conducting routine surveillance to gather and verify disease outbreak intelligence .
Bill Gates Dave Thompson - WPA Pool /Getty Images And we must ensure that countries share information in a timely way , and that there are adequate laboratory resources to identify and monitor suspect pathogens .
The third thing we need to do is prepare for epidemics the way the military prepares for war . This includes germ games and other preparedness exercises so we can better understand how diseases will spread , how people will respond in a panic , and how to deal with things like overloaded highways and communications systems .
We also need trained medical personnel ready to contain an epidemic quickly , and better coordination with the military to help with logistics and to secure areas .
It is encouraging that global alliances like the G7 and the G20 are beginning to focus on pandemic preparedness , and that leaders like Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Solberg are championing health security .
But there is n't enough money to help the poorest countries with epidemic preparation . The irony is that the cost of ensuring adequate pandemic preparedness worldwide is estimated at $ 3.4 billion a year—yet the projected annual loss from a pandemic could run as high as $ 570 billion .
The pandemic is one of the 3 biggest threats the world faces
Bill Gates believes climate change , nuclear war and pandemics are the three biggest world threats . Andrew Burton/Getty When I was a kid , there was really only one existential threat the world faced . The threat of a nuclear war . By the late 1990s , most reasonable people had come to accept that climate changed represented another major threat to humankind .
I view the threat of deadly pandemics right up there with nuclear war and climate change . Innovation , cooperation , and careful planning can dramatically mitigate the risks presented by each of these threats .
I 'm optimistic that a decade from now , we can be much better prepared for a lethal epidemic—if we 're willing to put a fraction of what we spend on defense budgets and new weapons systems into epidemic readiness .
When the next pandemic strikes , it could be another catastrophe in the annals of the human race . Or it could be something else altogether . An extraordinary triumph of human will . A moment when we prove yet again that , together , we are capable of taking on the world 's biggest challenges to create a safer , healthier , more stable world .
Not so long ago , every act of consumption began with a ritual . We pulled records from sleeves and perched them on turntables , slid books from shelves , watched as VHS tapes were ingested with a soft ca-chunk . Qleek , from Paris-based startup Ozenge , aims to return our digital media to a state in which they can be collected , stored , handled , played and shared in the same way that physical media were , once . The makers of Qleek want you to pick up a wooden hexagon printed with , for example , the artwork for an album or mix , place it on a reader , and hear the corresponding tracks play on your device of choice .
At first , Qleek sounds as if it will only interest the kind of nostalgics who want their houseguests to see how refined is their taste . But it 's an example of a larger phenomenon with the potential to redefine the nature of human-computer interfaces .
The problem : virtual interfaces do n't engage critical human talents
One of the downsides of early 21st-century technology is that the way we organize information emphasizes our dependence on machines rather than tapping into our innate abilities to process and retain things . But with the advent of technologies that bring more of the internet into the real world , designers have a chance to address this oversight .
As neurobiologist Mark Changizi has observed , ebooks , the web , and other libraries of digital media have no geography . Humans have an enormous capacity to remember things by locating them in space and time , so the lack of spatial constancy in our media—the way we are forced to “ teleport ” from one object to the next , as through a hyperlink—means we are hardly ever engaging this portion of our memories .
In nature , information comes with a physical address ( and often a temporal one ) , and one can navigate to and from the address . Those raspberry patches we found last year are over the hill and through the woods — and they are still over the hill and through the woods . And up until the rise of the web , the mechanisms for information storage were largely spatial and could be navigated , thereby tapping into our innate navigation capabilities .
There was an intermediary period in the development of our technology in which we got interfaces that were both electronic and physical—the control deck of this Russian nuclear power plant is a great example . But now we 've lost even those .
These days , the closest we get to engaging our spatial memory with our virtual interfaces is the layout of apps on our homescreens . To cope , we 've replaced spatial memory and navigation with search . While search is powerful , it can not exist outside of the devices that enable it , and by relying on an algorithm to recall what we 've forgotten rather than our own intuitive sense of where it is in the world or in our libraries , we forfeit control over which parts of our knowledge we have access to .
Approaching a solution : cheap connected devices
Qleek tiles live on your wall , or wherever you want to display your refined taste .
Qleek is composed of two parts : small wooden hexagons representing media , which could be music , movies or just about anything else , and a reader for the hexagons . Put a Qleek hexagon on the reader , and whatever media it “ contains ” will start playing on a specified device . Qleek is one of those designs , like Twitter , which at first seems so simple and arbitrary that verges on stupid .
Imagine , for example , a version of Qleek in which each tile contains its own modifiable display . Electronic paper ( the same thing that makes up the display of Kindle and other e-readers ) is already inexpensive enough to be used in store displays . Qleek tiles could supplement the collection of documents and folders we already splay across our virtual desktops . Where 's that project I was working on ? With smart , connected , cheap displays or other physical signifiers , it could literally be in your pocket .
Apple 's iBeacon as an enabling technology
Qleek Once your phone knows where any iBeacon-enabled object is , it can be used as an “ invisible button ” to affect something in the connected world .
Achieving a re-physicalization of media does n't even require a specialized technology like Qleek . Already stores are using battery-powered nodes to allow iPhones to know where they are in any physical space , so that shoppers can get offers and information on products pushed directly to their phones . This means any object containing an iBeacon and a coin-size battery ( which typically lasts for two years ) that is brought into proximity to an iPhone or recent-vintage Android smartphone could also become a Qleek-style signifier for any digital asset we want to assign to it .
Imagine , then , stacks of papers , or discs , or plastic tiles , that link to a particular location or file on the internet or in our computers . Anything bigger than a poker chip can contain an iBeacon , which communicates with smartphones via a protocol called Bluetooth low energy . Thinking further , it would also be possible to allow physical manipulations of these objects—they could have buttons , they could be touch-sensitive in their own right—to manipulate their contents . It 's also possible that something as simple as the location of these tiles could lead to the activation of what some call “ invisible buttons , ” which are key to how the internet of things will replace other means of interfacing with computers , like the web .
Thinking beyond historical examples of physical media
It 's tempting to think of physical objects that interface with the virtual world in terms of old metaphors . A wooden Qleek hexagon with an album cover printed on it is a cheeky—and probably unnecessary—reference to record , tape and CD collections of yore . Yes , you can use Qleek to share a mixtape with someone special , but that 's just where the possibilities start .
We 're at a uniquely exciting time in the evolution of the internet of things where the technology is beginning to run ahead of the vision of designers . What comes next is figuring out how to make the re-physicalization of media useful—and perhaps even elegant—instead of merely a curiosity .

In hindsight , the death of Alan Kurdi , a 3-year-old Syrian refugee who washed up on a Turkish shore after the boat they were in sank , may mark the high point in European public sympathy for refugees . The widespread reports that refugees and migrants were involved in mass sexual assaults in Cologne and other European cities on New Year 's Eve could well be its nadir .
Now the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo has attempted to marry the two moments , with an image that suggests that if Alan had survived their journey to Europe , they would have become a `` groper in Germany . ''
The cartoon can be seen here .
The image was drawn by Laurent Sourisseau , also known as `` Riss , '' a longtime contributor to the newspaper and its current publishing director . Sourisseau was present when Islamist extremists attacked the publication 's offices in January . That attack left 12 people dead ; Sourisseau was shot in the shoulder .

Although some recent comments from Sourisseau suggest that they are pushing a less combative agenda for Charlie Hebdo — moving away from images of the prophet Muhammad , for example — the new cartoon shows that the publication is not afraid to cause furor . Unsurprisingly , many have been outraged by the latest image .
I ca n't remember the last act of political speech that made me as viscerally enraged as that Charlie Hebdo cartoon . I do n't have words . — Michael Caley ( @ MC_of_A ) January 13 , 2016
So – * is * anyone ( who has some authority ) defending that Charlie Hebdo cartoon as not just massively racist ? Wd love to know , for real — Oliver Burkeman ( @ oliverburkeman ) January 13 , 2016

This is n't the first time that Charlie Hebdo has used the now-iconic image of the drowned Alan for satire , however . In September , the publication ran a few images that appeared to riff on the power of the image and Europe 's sudden display of sympathy for Syrian refugees . Even back then , The Washington Post 's Comic Riffs wondered whether those cartoons had crossed a line of decency . Michael Cavna spoke to a number of cartoonists about it , and the responses were mixed .
Charlie Hebdo mocking Aylan , the child that drowned . Where are all you `` Je Suis Charlie '' s at now ? Disgusting . pic.twitter.com/zdJEOr397o — طيب ( @ Tayyxb ) September 14 , 2015
But now the pendulum of public support for refugees in Europe has swung back the other way . There is widespread anger that a coverup may have occurred in the aftermath of the New Year 's Eve assaults . In the German city of Cologne , refugees and migrants have suffered what appears to be reprisal attacks . Polls suggest that foreigners in Europe are increasingly being viewed with suspicion . Charlie Hebdo may well have been satirizing the fickleness of Europe 's sympathy for refugees and migrants , or highlighting the absurdity of linking the many fearful refugee families to the alleged sexual assaults by grown men .
Even if that 's true , however , the satire misses the mark for many .

Robert Mueller 's investigation of Donald Trump has kicked into higher gear , with witnesses being called before a grand jury , new demands for information from the White House , probes of the connection between the Trump family business operations and their official decisions as president , as well as a deepening investigation of ties with Russia . One can only imagine how all this grates on Trump .
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , directly contradicting Trump 's fishing expedition claim , says Mueller can investigate any crime that they uncover in the course of investigating Russian influence in the 2016 campaign .
As the water keeps rising around Donald Trump , it is impossible to believe that Trump will not escalate their campaign of vilification of Mueller and their associates . Trump is the happiest firing people who get in their way . The intriguing question is what the new White House chief of staff , John Kelly , will do if Trump can not stand it any more and impulsively tries to fire Mueller .
That question must have come up in the prolonged discussions between Trump and Kelly before Kelly finally agreed to take the job . I was not in the room , but there is strong circumstantial evidence that Kelly told Trump that they would not stand for Mueller 's dismissal .
For starters , Kelly has strongly and publicly intervened to protect another Trump nemesis , the embattled Attorney General Jeff Sessions .
Last week , Kelly contacted Sessions and assured them that their job was safe , directly contradicting earlier threats by Trump . And just to be sure that Trump does n't attempt a firing and recess appointment of a successor attorney general , Republicans in the Senate have warned Trump that no successor would be confirmed .
Sessions , however , has recused themselves from the investigation of Trump . If Kelly has gone out their way to protect Sessions , they would surely do the same for Mueller .
Another clear signal : Someone let it be known around the time of Kelly 's appointment that Kelly had called former FBI chief James Comey to express anger and dismay at both the manner and the fact of Comey 's abrupt dismissal by Trump .
Again , it would be wildly inconsistent if Kelly were to sit still for the even more consequential firing of Muller .
So Kelly very likely made clear that ousting Mueller would be a dealbreaker for their own relationship with Trump . Kelly also got assurances that everyone in the administration would report to him , even Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump .
So far , Kelly has won high praise for cleaning up the chaos at the White House and being part of every major conversation and decision . But here 's the rub . Donald Trump is not as good as their word , and they ca n't control their impulses . They also are addicted to offline conversations . Jared and Ivanka may report to Kelly during office hours , but the new chief of staff ca n't stop Trump from talking with their daughter and son-in-law at other hours of day or night .
Trump is paranoid during normal times , but as the saying goes , even paranoids have real enemies . By definition , Mueller is an existential threat to the Trump presidency .
As the noose keeps tightening , Trump will become even more unhinged than usual . Some sort of showdown seems inevitable , which could end with Kelly resigning , Congress trying to block Mueller 's firing , or the immediate creation by Congress of a new special counsel beyond the reach of the White House . Alternatively , Mueller could survive long enough to deliver a bombshell report .
In the meantime , there has been a stunning series of Republican defections . These will only intensify if Trump tries to go after Mueller .
Once the repeal of Obamacare failed , Republicans under the leadership of Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander began reaching out to Democrats to fix the very real problems in many insurance markets — to strengthen the program not kill it . Republicans also compelled Trump to sign legislation removing their ability to suspend sanctions against Russia , and effectively blocked their ability to replace Sessions .
The GOP has had a bellyful . Key Republican leaders have warned Trump not to mess with Mueller . But my guess is that they wo n't be able to stop himself . And there could well be other conflicts where Trump begins to doubt Kelly 's basic loyalty .
In the past two weeks , Trump 's firewall of Republican partisan protection has begun to crumble . The conventional wisdom has been that a Republican Congress would never impeach Trump . This could change abruptly .
Since Trump 's election , I 've been of the view that they wo n't last two years . That seems more evident than ever .

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly waded into the long-simmering dispute over the removal of memorials to Confederate leaders saying in a televised interview on Monday night that `` the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War . ''
In the interview on Fox News ' `` The Ingraham Angle , '' host Laura Ingraham asked Kelly about the decision by Christ Church , an Episcopal congregation in the Washington suburb of Alexandria , Virginia , to remove plaques honoring President George Washington and Robert E. Lee , the commander of Confederate forces during the Civil War .

`` Well , history 's history , '' said Kelly , whom President Donald Trump moved from secretary of homeland security to be their chief of staff in July . `` You know , 500 years later , it 's inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back then . I think it 's just very , very dangerous . I think it shows you just how much of a lack of appreciation of history and what history is . ''
Confrontations over removal of Confederate monuments have exposed deep rifts in American society between advocates who argue that the Civil War is a foundation stone of American history whose combatants acted out of conscience and those who contend that the memorials honor Southern defenders of slavery who betrayed their country by launching an armed rebellion .

A subset of pro-memorial advocates includes so-called alt-right political activists and white nationalists , who were blamed for violence in Charlottesville , Virginia , in August when a car drove into a group of counter-protesters , killing one person and injuring 19 other people .
Trump 's reaction to Charlottesville drew condemnation after they said `` both sides '' were to blame for the violence and that there are `` two sides to a story . ''
Kelly on Monday night explained the Civil War 's genesis by saying `` men and women of good faith on both sides '' took a stand based on their conscience .
`` Robert E. Lee was an honorable man , '' Kelly said , adding : `` The lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War . ''
Kelly during the interview was also asked about whether they would apologize to Rep. Frederica Wilson , D-Fla. , for making inaccurate statements about them after they criticized Trump 's condolence call this month with a fallen soldier 's wife .
Kelly accused them of grandstanding during a 2015 ceremony to dedicate a new FBI field office in Miami and said they wrongly took credit for securing federal funding for the building . They did not take credit for it .
Still , Kelly held their ground Monday .
`` Oh , no , '' Kelly said . `` No . Never . Well , I 'll apologize if I need to . But for something like that , absolutely not . I stand by my comments . ''
The following is the full transcript of Kelly 's remarks on the removal of Confederate statues :
Well , history 's history . And there are certain things in history that were not so good and other things that were very , very good .
I think we make a mistake , though , and as a society , and certainly as individuals , when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100 , 200 , 300 years or more and say , 'What Christopher Columbus did was wrong . '
You know , 500 years later , it 's inconceivable to me that you would take what we think now and apply it back then . I think it 's just very , very dangerous . I think it shows you just how much of a lack of appreciation of history and what history is .
I would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man . They were a man that gave up their country to fight for their state , which 150 years ago was more important than country . It was always loyalty to state first back in those days . Now it 's different today . But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War , and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand .

Coca-Karma : The Very Secret Battle of Bob Kolody vs. Coca-Cola
Introduction : Coca-Karma Synopsis
At the heart of the story is an independent marketing consultant named Bob Kolody who claims they own the copyright to an image that has been used on Coke Classic cans since 1993 . The basic facts of the case are as follows :
Back in 1989 , Kolody pitched Simon Marketing ( Coke 's ad agency ) on a game concept that involved a graphic collusion of Coca-Cola and automobile memorabilia . Kolody heard nothing back from Simon but , nine months later , learned that aspects of their campaign were being disseminated through Coke 's new Cherry Coke can design . When Kolody attempted to discuss the matter with Simon 's executives they were rebuffed and they claimed to have lost their story-boards .
Even more interesting is that at the same time that Kolody was pitching Simon , Coke failed to renew their copyright on a very famous image that appeared on their first soda can in 1961 : the 'contour bottle on the Coca-Cola can ' image . When Coke failed to renew the 1961 copyright ( as they must do after 28 years ) Kolody , the suit claims , became the de facto rights holder because they had created a derivative work of the image for their pitch with Simon .
This was all unbeknownst to Kolody , who was still trying to fight Simon on their infringement suit .
Then , in 1993 , Coke resurrected the 'contour bottle ' image for their Classic Coke cans and , the suit documents , filed a fraudulent copyright application in order to protect it . This is the legal crux of the case and demands elaboration . In its landmark ruling on copyright , Abend Case law stipulates that an entity is not allowed to file for a copyright on an image that has already been published and then released into the public domain or adopted by someone else . In the case of the 'contour bottle ' , Coke either forgot to renew their copyright or did not understand the law . When they re-filed in 1993 , the copyright office warned them that to file for a copyright which has already been published is fraud . Coke went ahead and did it regardless .
In 1994 Kolody saw the 'contour bottle ' on a Coke Classic Can in a Chicago airport and realized what that Coke had now adopted another of their original concepts . For three years they could not get a lawyer to file their case against Coca-Cola and Simon Marketing .
Finally , in 1997 , they got John De Camp - a one-time Nebraska state senator and friend of former CIA-head Bill Colby - to file . But De Camp could not afford to continue on contingency so Kolody was forced to forge on pro se ( without legal representation ) . Kolody learned the law from every conceivable source and fought their case in court against one of the country 's top intellectual property lawyers ( Jerold Jacover ) . Using every imaginable legal dirty trick , Coca-Cola 's legal team hampered Kolody 's case and successfully avoided publicity on what has evolved into a $ 4 billion lawsuit . Furthermore , Judge Blanche Manning ( the judge in this case ) refused to compel Coca-Cola to demonstrate that they held the legal registrations of copyright on the contour bottle . When Kolody attained the application independently from the U.S , copyright office , Manning would not allow them to introduce the document as new evidence . This was a crushing blow to Kolody who had finally discovered proof that Coke failed to renew its copyright and then filed a fraudulent copyright application to protect themselves .
In 1999 , Kolody successfully retained renowned Arkansas federal attorney Dan Ivy to fight their case . As soon as they came onto the scene , Ivy discovered a series of judicial improprieties emanating from the bench . In response , they filed several motions of 'judicial perjury ' - a motion that accuses the judge of committing fraud upon the court in their blatantly favorable rulings for Coca-Cola . This is the first time in Chicago judicial history that a lawyer has leveled such a serious charge against a federal judge . But Judge Manning , instead of stepping aside to have their improprieties assessed by an independent Judge , ruled on these charges themselves - a practice that defies the principles of Anglo-Saxon law .
What happened next is like a plot from a John Grisham novel . After Judge Manning dismissed Kolody 's lawsuit with a summary judgment , Ivy moved the case to the Appellate Court . But , in an apparent effort to censure the crusading attorney for their conduct , the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals denied their entrance to the bar , leaving Kolody without an attorney . What makes this even more intriguing is that all eleven Judges of the Appellate met in a rare , closed-door 'en banc ' hearing to deny their request and offered no elaboration for their decision . After filing a motion for clarification of their ruling ( under the 14th Amendment ) , Ivy , was denied 'en banc ' a second time and given no reason given for the refusal .
There have also been a number of suspicious coincidences surrounding Kolody 's case . Most shocking was that Kolody 's own local counsel , Daniel Hanley , admitted under questioning to have a sister who was a major media buyer for Coca-Cola in the United States and that they had been feeding their information of Kolody 's legal strategy . What 's more , an affidavit was filed by famed court reformer Sherman Skolnick ( who has had more judges imprisoned and disbarred for judicial misconduct than any other person in U.S. history ) that ties Judge Manning to major Chicago underworld figure William F. Cellini and asserts that their Judgeship was bought through a corrupt system of dealings . Both of these charges were made in a heated court hearing that saw a group of six armed police officers enter the courtroom . To date , Hanley has not been sanctioned for their admission and neither Judge Manning nor Bill Cellini have refuted the claims made in Skolnick 's affidavit .
Interesting , too , is that Coke has disregarded the case in their SEC filings . Initially this may sound innocuous , but not when you remember that Coke 's entire business is the sale of their syrup formula and licensing of their logo to bottlers . This means that the bottlers have been paying license fees to a fraudulent copyright owner for seven years . Combine this with the fact that tensions between bottlers and Coke reached an all-time high last year when Coke was accused , in a major lawsuit , of dumping syrup on their bottlers in order to bolster a sagging fourth quarter earnings report .
The case is currently being appealed to Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens ( supervisor of the 7th Circuit ) under a special application for 'chamber business ' . This is especially dramatic considering the fact that it was Justice Stevens who , when they were a young lawyer on the 7th Circuit , headed up a special committee that presided over what became known as the 'biggest judicial bribery scandal in United States history ' . The allegations surfaced publicly when , in 1969 , a maverick public crusader by the name of Sherman Skolnick brought charges against a group of Judges for bribery .
Due to the complexity of this case and the verifiable evidence of judicial misconduct on the part of Coca-Cola 's lawyers and Judge Manning , we recommend that you take the time to read the entire story . We are confident that you will be neither bored nor disappointed with the dramatic recounting of this tale .

I just received word from a source of mine that SNK Playmore , the Neo-Geo creator responsible for such classic titles as The King of Fighters and Metal Slug , will soon be closing its doors , at least in the US . This summer , the company will officially cease direct sale of its games and will instead see distribution duties go to Ignition USA .
In 2001 , the original incarnation of SNK closed as well , with company founder Eikichi Kawasaki investing in a new company known as Playmore . By 2003 , Playmore had become SNK Playmore , sometimes just referred to by the original name of SNK . The new distribution plans happened a while back , but it seems like things are a bit more serious .
No word on whether this is just SNKP US or if this affects Japan as well . What I do know is that a lot of SNKP US people are out of a job . Well , pretty much everyone from what I know . We 'll let you know more when we hear it .
[ Update : This was apparently proven false , but all I have to go on is a leaked email from SNKP US president Ben Herman . I ca n't do more than talk about what I read , and I have included the exact words after the jump for you to see if there is any other conclusion I might be able to draw from it . ]
SNKP closing again :
Here we go again . SNK will exit direct sales by year end and plans to distribute new stuff thru Ignition USA . I will help them close down again but my full time duties end June 30th .
Maybe something changed between now and then , but them 's the president 's words . Maybe they 're relocating without telling them or something .

The reason this bed is so primitive is that I had just moved countries and had no power tools with which to make one , except my first purchase , a cordless drill . That 's all you 'll need , because you can get the plywood cut to size when you buy it ( home centers and lumberyards all have panel saws for exactly this purpose ) .
5/8 '' ( or thicker ) plywood cut to the size of your mattress . This will probably involve two sheets . Buy the cheap stuff or recycle some , no one is going to see it . Measure your mattress carefully first ! Keep the offcuts for future projects .
Lots of plastic bottles . They do n't have to be the same brand , but do need to be the same height and diameter , made of PET , and have plastic lids . I used 710 ml bottles of Canada Dry - the previous owner of my house was clearly a fan . You could , of course , make a higher bed by using bigger bottles .
Screws - at least 77 , shorter than the thickness of your plywood . I found a box of 1/2 '' self-tapping square drive screws , so used them . You 'll also need 2-3 longer screws .
If you have n't been following Sabres backup goalie Jhonas Enroth ( @ JEnroth125 ) in recent weeks , you 've been missing out on an entertaining and illuminating look at what he 's been up during the early days of the NHL lockout .
Let 's take a brief look at some of their tweets to catch a glimpse of how he 's holding up during this difficult time .
I had a nightmare last night . I dreamed that my car was damaged . First thing I did this am was to go and check it out . # phew # scary # < 3Audi — Jhonas Enroth ( @ JEnroth125 ) September 14 , 2012
One day before the official start of the lockout , and Enroth has a dream that their Audi was damaged . Bad omen , perhaps ? Upon checking it out first thing the next morning , they discover that all is well , disaster is averted . For we 're all aware that for the average NHL player , the disposable income necessary to fix a vehicle simply wo n't be there in a few weeks . Scary , indeed .
I forgot to mention awesome day at the Ralph . Great game Bills ! ! # BillsMafia # buffalo # buffalove — Jhonas Enroth ( @ JEnroth125 ) September 17 , 2012
One day after the lockout is officially announced , we see a series of tweets from Enroth ( and several other Sabres players ) being sent from Ralph Wilson Stadium , the home of the Bills , where the biggest disappointment of the day was a loss to the Jets . How inspiring it is to see local athletes sticking together through their respective tough times .
So sick of this lockout . Playing in the NHL have been a lifelong dream and now we ca n't bc of GB want more money from us ? # imlosingtime — Jhonas Enroth ( @ JEnroth125 ) September 19 , 2012
Four days in and Enroth has clearly had it with the lockout . Drafted in 2006 , they have been waiting for their chance to shine in the NHL , and at the old age of 24 , time is clearly running out on their hockey career . All credit to Enroth for coining a new slogan for the lockout in this tweet , though – “ GB want more money ” pretty much sums it up .
Just picked up the new FIFA 13 from @ oogiegames . It 's a good chance ill be on the couch playing it all day . # FIFA13 — Jhonas Enroth ( @ JEnroth125 ) September 25 , 2012
https : //twitter.com/JEnroth125/status/251388337078816768
Before GB can get their hands on all of Enroth 's hard earned coin , they head off to the mall to pick up FIFA 13 ( note : not NHL 13 ) . And like any good gamer , they park themselves on the couch and plays all day , only to find later that week that they ca n't even get themselves into an online footy match , let alone an NHL game .
Anyone need a goalie ? # willstoppucksformoney — Jhonas Enroth ( @ JEnroth125 ) September 29 , 2012
As such , Enroth takes it upon themselves to put out their own ad on Twitter , stating quite clearly that they are more than willing to stop pucks for cash . Side note : plenty of their NHL brethren are heading over to Europe to suit up for teams in any number of cities . Did Enroth miss that memo ?
Why does MLB teams pop champagne like they won a championship game when they just made the playoffs ? # settledown — Jhonas Enroth ( @ JEnroth125 ) October 2 , 2012
And finally , just this morning , Enroth took to twitter to sound off on MLB 's apparent over the top celebrations , where baseball players pop champagne over merely qualifying for the playoffs . While this potentially raises questions about how their time on the couch has dried up of their competitive drive , or in regards to their lack of identification with that euphoric feeling based on the fact that the Sabres did n't qualify for the playoffs last year , it will be interesting to see how they react if/when the Sabres achieve a measure of success at some point in the future . Expect a reserved & subdued reaction , saving the bubbly strictly for Stanley .
In all seriousness , Enroth 's tweets are but a small sample of the frustrations / attempts to keep busy that all NHL players must be experiencing right now , to varying degrees . And as the lockout drags on , it will be harder and harder to find some sort of humour in the midst of this otherwise dreary situation . One can only hope that a new collective bargaining agreement comes to fruition soon , or at the very least that Jhonas is able to find themselves an online FIFA opponent before they resort to doing more than just stopping pucks for money .
And please , someone watches over the Audi .
End note : Shortly after this piece was published , Enroth tweeted out these two gems , which only serve to reinforce their status as an NHL lockout ‘ must follow ' on Twitter .
Just signed a one game contract with La Nova pizza beer league team , debut is tomorrow at 10 pm at Buff State . — Jhonas Enroth ( @ JEnroth125 ) October 2 , 2012
Earlier today quotes emerged from a Mesut Ozil interview with SportBILD , in which they talked about how they were singled out for criticism , their ‘ heart ' beating for Real Madrid and more .
As ever with these things , mere snippets do n't provide the full context , so with thanks to Lewis Ambrose ( ‪ @ LGAmbrose‬ ) , we can give you that .
This is all the Arsenal related stuff from their interview .
PLEASE NOTE : To websites/blogs/media organisations : if you take the translation from here , a link back to this article would be greatly appreciated .
Mr. Özil , in 31 games for Arsenal you 've scored nine – more than ever before – and got nine assists . Why are you still criticised so often ?
Actually it is extreme in both directions . When I 'm out and about loads of fans call my name , they want a photo . The national team fan club just voted me player of the year , millions visit my social media sites . Numbers do n't lie .
On the other side there are critics and the expectations on me are extreme . People know what I 've achieved . That I 'm a world champion , have played for Real Madrid , had 20 assists last season . So when it is n't going great for the team , someone gets picked out – unfortunately , often it 's me .
How do you deal with that ?
Eventually you have thick skin . It used to trouble me , I thought about it , but if you continue like that you 'll be broken . I have become stronger and not everyone can like you . But you know what makes me . Proud ? That the Arsenal fans have written an Özil song .
In that the fans sing you 're better than Zidane ! You wrote about that in your book , ‘ Magician of the game ' .
I have never experienced something like that in a club . Every time the fans sing it I get goosebumps .
How would you rate your season ?
I started strongly but – like the team in general – not kept up my performance . When it is n't going well overall it is twice as hard for a creative player . Take the games against Bayern , for instance .
Arsenal lost 5-1 twice ! You were accused of sinking again
Exactly . But I 'm not the type of player to chase after the ball the whole time , everyone knows that . My potential lies far more on the offensive side . I 'm supposed to be dangerous , create chances , score goals . When I do n't get the ball , that 's difficult .
Your contract expires in 2018 . Is it right that Arsenal has withdrawn their offer to you ?
You must not believe everything you read . I will just say I have one year to go and I love to run onto the pitch for the club . At the moment everything is open . Let 's wait and see what happens .
The fans would like to chase Arsène Wenger away ! Mats Hummels recently said after Carlo Ancelotti was spat at ( by Hertha Berlin fans , not Bayern ) that fans have less and less respect . Do you see it similarly ?
I appreciate the enthusiasm of our fans , the passion . But there have to be limits . I agree with Mats there . We are people , we make mistakes like everyone else . Anyone who works in football and in the public eye has to deal with pressure , that 's a part of it . But one should maintain respect for people and not exceed certain limits .
Is a Bundesliga comeback conceivable one day ?
I would n't want to rule it out . Many relatives – especially my mum – would welcome it if I were closer- But you can never plan these things in football .

So , there you go , unsurprisingly they 're being sensationalised elsewhere .
We could definitely use the Ozil from the first half of the season if we 're to finish strongly , and Sunday would be a great start there .
MUMBAI : To make Indian currency notes more secured and less prone to counterfeiting , the RBI has started printing Rs 100 notes on which the last six digits of the 9-digit currency note number will be in ascending print size from left to right . For example if a Rs 100 note has the number 9AA 123456 , the ‘ 9AA ' part will have uniform print size for all the three characters . However , in the six-digit number part , the print size for ‘ 2 ' will be larger than ‘ 1 ' , print size for ‘ 3 ' will be larger than ‘ 2 ' and so on with ‘ 6 ' being in the largest font size.As of now , all other security features for this new series of Rs 100 notes will remain the same . Very soon the central bank will issue all currency notes , from Rs 10 to Rs 1,000 denominations , on which the numbering will be in this new ascending print size pattern , also called exploding font. “ Printing the numerals in ascending size is a visible security feature in the banknotes so that the general public can easily distinguish a counterfeit note from a genuine one , ” a release from the central bank said . “ The Reserve Bank , in consultation with Government of India , has been improving security features of Indian banknotes so as to make their counterfeiting difficult and make it easy for members of public to identify genuine banknotes , ” it said.This new security feature is part of RBI 's continuing endeavour to improve security features of currency notes to make them more robust . Going forward , the currency notes will have moving images or variation in colour , micro-perforations etc . on security threads on each currency note . The moving images and colour variations with distinct contrasts are visible only when the viewing angles on the currency notes are changed.On June 19 , the central bank invited global pre-qualification bids for eligible entities working in the field of currency security including manufacturers of security threads , inks and other related technologies . Some of the security features will also be invisible to human eyes and are only machine readable , the tender documents showed.As part of its security enhancement measures , the RBI is also withdrawing currency notes printed prior to 2005 . On Thursday the central bank extended the date to December 31 , 2015 for general public holding pre-2005 currency notes to exchange the same with newer ones having better security features .
BEIJING , June 11 ( Xinhua ) -- Ten years after China sent its first man into low earth orbit , three astronauts operating the Shenzhou-10 spacecraft started a journey on a mission which seeks a permanent space station around 2020 .
Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the launch site that the crew carry a `` space dream '' of the Chinese nation and represent the lofty aspirations of the Chinese people to explore space .
The dream , though also dreamt by the more frequent space travelers of Russia and American , includes a manned space station , moon exploration and even deep space odysseys .
The dream is a humble one . China was decades behind Russia and the United States in space technology . But Chinese pursue it unswervingly in line with a carefully designed three-phase manned space program .
Two years after the space flight operated by China 's first astronaut , Yang Liwei , two men , including Shenzhou-10 commander Nie Haisheng , orbited the earth in 2005 . Then three more in 2008 , two of whom finished China 's first extra-vehicular activities ( EVA ) .
After the unmanned Shenzhou-8 and Tiangong-1 space module docking in 2011 to test automated space docking , a key skill to assemble a space station , three Chinese astronauts succeeded in operating the docking manually in 2012 .
The Shenzhou-10 mission , if successful , marks the end of the first half of the second phase , which means China has completely mastered EVA and space docking skills .
These missions were comparatively easy for other space giants . China 's Long March rockets carry much lower payloads than NASA 's Saturn V , and Tiangong-1 is much smaller than both the Soviet Mir space station and the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
However , just as the female astronaut Wang Yaping said , `` we are all students in facing the vast universe . '' China 's pursuit of its own space dream showcases a latecomer 's unremitting interests and desire to learn about the universe .
During the 15-day Shenzhou-10 mission , Wang will hold a class in space educating a group of students from a high school in Beijing through satellite communication .
This in-orbit event , hopefully broadcast live , will inspire students and also spur citizen 's space interests in a country with 1.3-billion people , making this an unparalleled popularization of science in human history .
Similar to other space giants , China 's space program was carried out by astronauts selected from air force pilots and supported by military resources . But China has reaffirmed that it opposes militarization of the space and will utilize the space in a peaceful way .
After the year 2020 , China 's future space station will probably be the only one of any kind in service considering the ISS 's retirement plan . By then , China 's space dream will not only serve its own people but also contribute to space exploration for the human race .
BEST JAKE-ENING
For the second consecutive game , JV18 did something remarkable in a third .
Sunday , it was the Kronwalling , a play which will undoubtedly go down as one of the smackdowns of the entire season .
There was no such signpost moment Tuesday . Only a game-winner for Jake . Ho-hum .
Is that all ? No , actually . It was a game winner entirely created and finished by the man their teammates kept calling the Big Tuna .
They did n't win the game all on their own but damn they were close . And to think they did all of this playing just 10 minutes .
They made the shifts count . They were poised to score with Henrik on a 2-on-1 , but the captain waited too long to pour them the sauce .
Asked about it later , Coach Green said : “ He 's got a lot of assists , I 'm not one to tell them how to pass . ”
Good point .
Earlier in the game , a puck was left dangling on the Wild goal line and JV18 just missed squeezing their stick blade between Dubnyk 's pad and the post .
If they had , it was a goal too .
So in this game obnoxiously devoid of fun , in relative terms , Virtanen was lit .
They still did n't play much in the third . Four shifts and 2:42 . Burmistrov played more . Yikes .
Green has been warming to JV18 , but he 's still not into them enough to make your chocolate hot . Or even lukewarm .
If JV18 keeps playing like this , it will change . They played one shift after they scored . One in the final 10 minutes . It was that one when they helped create a 2-on-1 with Henrik .
“ It 's a good combination , ” Green conceded . “ His speed is helping them and they 're helping them with their speed .
“ It 's been nice the last three games for them to get their line to play that way . ”
BEST PLAY
Minny media was calling it a fluke bounce . But this was all Virtanen . They were aggressive , and smart . And quick .
The best part for him ? It all happened because of instinct . They are n't thinking . They barely can remember how it went down .
“ I honestly do n't even know , ” JV18 said . “ I may have just got on the ice .
“ Maybe ?
“ I just saw the turnover and I just went for it . It was just the flow of the moment . I just got it and took off . ”
This is the kind of mindset you want this player in . This is the kind of mindset the previous coach never would infuse in JV18 . Willie wanted thinking on the ice all the time .
Really , though , you want Virtanen to see puck , get puck , go with puck and shoot puck .
“ I was honestly just trying to shoot for a rebound on the first one . I saw them going to the net and I was trying to get it low on a pad .
“ I was hoping it would get a rebound and they 'd get a greasy one . Most of the young guys will try to go top shelf there . But I was looking for the grease .
There was nothing greasy about what ended up happening .
“ The puck just landed right in my wheelhouse so it was perfect for me . ”
BEST OF THE KRONWALLING
JV18 : “ My dad was laughing about it . They texted me and said they thought it was really funny I gave them credit for it .
“ He 's seen me do it a couple times before over the years . He 's always been a Canucks fan . He 's happy the boys are winning . ”

The penalties the Canucks took tonight were right out of the 2013 playoff series with the San Jose Sharks .
There was this one on Tommy Gun which looked ridiculous and was totally sold by Spurgeon with that hand shaking .
“ Ahh , it was a makeup call from my battle with Koivu 10 seconds earlier , ” Vanek said .
“ I was going for the puck and Spurgeon was reaching for it three feet forward , ” Tommy Gun pointed out .
Did they sell it ?
Vanek : “ Of course . He 's a smart guy . He 's a great player .
“ He looked at me after and gave me a little wink . ”
Oh man , that 's cold .
BEST GOALIE
Ride the hot hand ? Who 's in ?
That 's two shutouts in three games for Anders Mountain .
“ He either pitches a shutout or they get out of there in 10 minutes , ” Green joked .
Having seen Miller , Luongo and Markstrom up close in Van , what is striking to many of us locals is how quiet and subtle and efficient they are in that net .
The Zucker wrap is such a great example of this .
They look deep and patient off the rush
The great part ?
This is an example of them being overly aggressive .
“ I felt I was too aggressive on the initial play , ” Anders said . “ He wrapped it and I was able to make a big push .
“ I was happy I was able to use my reach and long legs to get there but they had a lot of speed . ”
The legend of Anders Mtn grows . But they do not .
I 've seen them become a giant in the media .
I asked them how tall they really are .
“ I 'm 6-foot-5 and a half , ” they said .
And then they went on to talk about all the years they spent trying to figure out how to play with that size .
“ I 've always been big , ” Anders said .
“ But in my early 20s , I had to learn to calm down .
“ For a while , most tall guys do n't realize how much doing small movements can help .
“ When I was younger , I was all over the place . I 'd open up and pucks were going in , underarms , under pads .
“ For me , it was learning the small movements I had to do . It was about learning to be patient and calmer . ”
Dude , it shows .

No , not yet .
BEST UPDATE
Seems every season around now the Canucks are involved in just about every big-name player who , however briefly , gets a stay on the rumoured trade block .
And there always seems to be fall speculation the team is shopping Hutton . And there was understandably this week speculation the Canucks would or should be angling to add another defenceman to help weather injuries to Edler and Stecher .
That last one would have had some legs if Stecher was gone for the season and that was feared .
However , with the fortunate news they got on Stech , Benning said they are now not looking to add a D .
“ No , we 're not , ” Benning said . “ We called up Wiercioch and have 7 D now so we 're not doing anything . ”

“ I knocked the puck away and their stick broke when they were trying to shoot it .
“ Listen , I do n't want to get involved in ( officiating ) but the crowd was going maybe they did n't have a good view .

The first reports about Stecher 's knee were not good . Rumours were there was a “ pop ” in their knee .
The Canucks feared the worst . There was a sense he 'd need season-ending knee surgery .
Team was stoked to get the news he 'd only miss 4-6 weeks after an MRI back in Vancouver .
Did fear Stecher was lost for the season help motivate the team to make the Demko move which helped maximize cap space ?

The Canucks PP works great in creating an opportunity . Only problem was Boeser was net front . So Pouliot was set up and the shot was , well , not good .
Going wide , so they did n't even count that muffin a shot on net .
Given same time and space , The Flow would have settled that puck down , and sniped for a top corner . Everyone would have marvelled at how much time they had and people would have said “ You never get that kind of time in the NHL . ”
You do n't if you rush a shot like that one .

If you 're not going to shoot this then when ?
And look at Pouliot at the end , getting another open shot at the net that went nowhere .
BEST BREAKDOWN OF A BAD SITUATION
On the surface , the Rodin situation does n't look good for anyone .
He 's played one game . In a month .
They played in six games . All of last season .
They signed with the Canucks for a chance to play in the NHL . Now , he 's not even getting a chance to play . Anywhere .
Look at Saturday . Trent Cull scratched Jordan Subban in favour of a vet , 34-year-old career minor leaguer Jaime Sifers . Because of this , one fewer vet could play . Rodin was scratched . Again .
People have been wondering if it means Rodin is ready to go back to Europe . Some suggest they even had an escape agreement worked into their contract . The Canucks are adamant a play-or-flight clause was not discussed in negotiations .
We 'll see .
What was important to Rodin ? A one-way contract . Word is , they did have other offers , but no other team was willing to give them a one-way .
As someone smart who knows their camp well told me :
“ I guess part of their thinking was if they give you a one way they must have plans to use you . But what good is the one way if you do n't get a chance to play ? ”
The good news , and there is some , there is more at play here than the vet rule .
Rodin cleared waivers on Oct. 1 , but they did n't join the Comets until Oct. 6 in Toronto , after having worked through immigration issues .
The Comets played in TO on Oct. 7 and 8 .
“ He had n't skated all week , ” Benning said . “ So they did n't play in those two games . They practised a few days and I think they 've only played two or three games since . ”
Three . But on the third , which was Saturday , Benning suggested Rodin may not have been entirely healthy .
“ Now , he 's got a bit of a sore hamstring . ”
FWIW , Benning is not concerned at all about the veteran rule creating issues moving forward .
“ It will work itself out , ” they said . “ They 've hardly played any games down there .
“ With the injuries up here , calling guys up combined with injuries down there , it will work out .
“ Right now we have Wiercicoch and Chaput up . There are two less veterans . So they 're good to go down there now . ”
See ? They had this all planned all along !
All of this comes as some relief . If Rodin was hurt on Saturday , their scratch becomes understandable .
Now . what is unclear is if Rodin had signed if they knew the Canucks would be bringing in Gagner , Burmistrov AND Vanek .
Consider how many players are ahead of him . Of those not in the Canucks lineup Tuesday , you have Eriksson , Chaput and Gaunce who will play this weekend in Utica .
On their own team , in the AHL , Goldy , Boucher and probably Megna could all be ahead of him .
I guess that could change .
But how well would they have to play to do that ? And for how long ?
And what kind of opportunity is they going to get with Cull ?
Something to watch .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Outgoing President Hamid Karzai on Tuesday blamed the United States for Afghanistan 's long war in a final swipe at the country that helped bring them to power 13 years ago but towards which they have become increasingly bitter .

Their farewell speech came days ahead of the swearing in of a new president , Ashraf Ghani , after months of turmoil over a disputed election that ended in a power-sharing deal , yet to be tested , with rival Abdullah Abdullah who will fill the role of chief executive .
Karzai blamed both the United States and neighboring Pakistan for the continuing war with the Taliban-led insurgency and warned the new government to be “ extra cautious in relations with the U.S. and the West ” .
The conflict kills thousands of Afghans each year and has claimed the lives of more than 2,200 American and other international forces in Afghanistan .
“ One of the reasons was that the Americans did not want peace because they had their own agenda and objectives , ” Karzai said . They did not elaborate , but in the past has suggested continued violence has been an excuse for the United States to keep bases in the country .
U.S . Ambassador to Afghanistan James Cunningham called Karzai 's comments “ ungracious and ungrateful ” .
“ It makes me kind of sad . Their remarks , which were uncalled for , do a disservice to the American people and dishonor the sacrifices made by Americans here , ” Cunningham said .
Karzai also accused Pakistani power players of trying to control their country 's foreign policy .
“ Today , I tell you again that the war in Afghanistan is not our war , but imposed on us and we are the victims , ” Karzai said . “ No peace will arrive unless the U.S. or Pakistan want it . ”
In recent years , Karzai has denounced the United States for the deaths of Afghan civilians in air strikes and for holding suspected Afghan militants prisoner without trial . The relationship deteriorated to near breaking point this year when Karzai refused to sign a security pact with the United States .
They said they had traveled to Pakistan , where much of the Taliban 's leadership is believed to be based , at least 20 times seeking a negotiated end to the war , but their efforts were thwarted .
Pakistan 's embassy in Kabul had no immediate comment on Karzai 's speech .
Karzai has been in power since 2001 after being plucked from virtual obscurity by the United States after the overthrow of the Taliban 's radical Islamist government for sheltering al Qaeda 's leadership after the 9/11 attacks on the United States .
The deterioration of their relationship with the West was seen by some as an effort to shape their legacy as an independent leader rather than a U.S. puppet as maintained by the Taliban .
Karzai was barred by the constitution from running for a third term this year .
Saudi Arabia , the Gulf kingdom ruled by an absolute monarchy and key United States ally , is planning to behead 14 men for participating in anti-government protests after what Amnesty International called a “ grossly unfair mass trial . ”
“ By confirming these sentences Saudi Arabia 's authorities have displayed their ruthless commitment to the use of the death penalty as a weapon to crush dissent and neutralize political opponents , ” Samah Hadid of Amnesty International said .
Earlier this month , the Supreme Court of Saudi Arabia decided to uphold the sentences , and the 14 men were transferred to Riyadh , indicating that the beheadings could occur anytime .
“ King Salman 's signature is now all that stands between them and their execution , ” Hadid said .
According to Amnesty International , the condemned prisoners were “ subjected to prolonged pretrial detention and had been tortured and otherwise ill-treated during their interrogation to extract their ‘ confessions ' . ”
The condemned includes a young student named Mujtaba al-Suweyket , who was only 17 at the time of their sentencing . They were in the midst of preparations to leave to the U.S. to study at Western Michigan University . They were arrested at the airport .
Western Michigan University urged “ critical national political figures with influence ” in Saudi Arabia to prevent the executions when they found out what had happened to the prospective student .
“ We were stunned to learn , for the first time , of this situation . It is not unusual for an admitted student to opt out of enrolling at the last minute , so we had no idea there was such a troubling reason behind this student 's failure to come to campus , ” the spokes person for the university , Cheryl Roland said to Michigan Live .
The American Federation of Teacher 's has also issued a statement urging U.S. President Donald Trump to use their influence with the Gulf kingdom to stop the executions .
In addition to al-Suweyket , the men to be beheaded for their protest participation includes Hussein al-Rabi ' , Abdullah al-Tureif , Hussein al-Mosallem , Mohamed al-Naser , Mustafa al-Darwish , Fadel Labbad , Sa'id al-Sakafi , Salman al-Qureish , Munir al-Adam , Abdullah al-Asreeh , Ahmad al-Darwish , Abdulaziz al-Sahwi , Ahmad al-Rab ' i .
Executions employing brutal methods , such as beheading and crucifixion in one of the largest purchasers of U.S. weapons as well as a key regional ally for the U.S. and United Kingdom , are unfortunately a regular occurrence . Amnesty International estimates that at least 66 people have been executed in 2017 alone , with 26 of those being in the past three weeks .
Tainted Drywall Foul air from Chinese-made drywall is causing a nightmare for thousands of homeowners , who have complained about severe respiratory ailments and corroded electronics . Several companies that handled the drywall knew there was a problem for two years but did n't warn consumers or regulators .
Last week , federal lawmakers trumpeted the passage of the Drywall Safety Act of 2012 as a bipartisan victory for thousands of homeowners harmed by contaminated drywall .
`` This is a bill about protecting American families — their health and financial well-being , '' said Rep. Scott Rigell , R-Va. , the measure 's primary sponsor in the House . `` It is up to Congress to ensure that preventative standards are in place so no American family is faced with the hardship and heartache from contaminated drywall ever again . ''
But the bill does n't actually set preventative standards . Instead , it asks an industry association committee comprised mostly of drywall manufacturers and builders to develop voluntary limits on sulfur content in drywall for the government to enforce .
The measure was prompted by widespread problems with drywall , mostly imported from China to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina . The board emitted high amounts of odorous sulfur gas , triggering respiratory problems for residents and causing household electronics to fail . ProPublica and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune uncovered deep flaws with how the government dealt with contaminated drywall in 2010 and 2011 .
The Consumer Product Safety Commission , which led the years-long federal investigation into the problem , still does n't know exactly what caused the drywall to emit gas , so it 's unclear what impact a sulfur content limit will have .
The first version of the bill , proposed by Rigell in March 2012 , stipulated that contaminated drywall be treated as a banned hazardous substance and included criminal and civil penalties for those who sold it or built with it .
But the bill was gradually watered down by building industry lobbyists and their allies .
First , the House Committee on Energy and Commerce struck out Rigell 's provisions on enforcement and penalties . The revised bill instead directed the CPSC to develop labeling to make sheets of wallboard traceable to the original manufacturer and to set a limit on sulfur content inside drywall or adopt a `` voluntary standard '' set by the industry .
Those changes were n't enough to satisfy the homebuilders ' lobby .
The National Association of Home Builders ' top lobbyist , James Tobin , wrote an open letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner , R-Ohio , in September 2012 saying the measure still gave the CPSC too much power . Industry should be assured an opportunity to influence any rule to come out of the bill through a public comment process , the letter said .
`` Homebuilding is already a highly regulated industry , '' Tobin wrote . Letting the CPSC pick a voluntary standard , they said , `` sets a dangerous precedent that will create unintended consequences . ''
The association found an ally in Sen. David Vitter , R-La. , whose constituents include hundreds of homeowners who rebuilt their houses with contaminated board .
When the bill reached the Senate , Vitter placed a hold on it , then amended it to address the home builder association 's concerns .
In Vitter 's version , the CPSC would adopt a limit on sulfur content for drywall developed by a committee of the American Society for Testing and Materials , an industry association that develops voluntary standards for a variety of building products .
The same committee , staffed by a mix of builders and drywall manufacturers , was tasked with developing a protocol to fix homes with problem drywall when the problem first arose in 2008 , but never released its plan .
The Vitter bill also directs the CPSC to use a tracking label protocol developed by the ASTM .
Neither Vitter nor the NAHB agreed to an interview for this article .
When the bill was sent for President Obama 's signature last week , Vitter released a press statement that the builders ' association supported the proposal . Previously , the association had released a statement expressing its `` sincere gratitude '' for the Senate revisions .
Homeowners said they had mixed feelings about the new law .
Colleen Stephens , who left their home in Virginia in 2009 because of fears for their health , said they were pleased that the government will be better able to track the origins of bad drywall in the future . But they said they were disappointed the measure did n't do more to hold manufacturers and builders accountable .
`` I 'm not thrilled with it , but it 's better than absolutely nothing , '' Stephens said .
TEL AVIV , Israel , Jan. 14 ( UPI ) -- Rafael Advanced Defense Systems , Israel 's second-largest state-owned defense company , is reported ready to start co-producing its Iron Dome anti-missile defense system with the Raytheon Co. of the United States , consolidating an alliance that 's already developing the Stunner interceptor missile of Rafael 's David 's Sling system designed by Rafael .
Defense News , a U.S. weekly , says Rafael is expected to sign on to a new deal with Raytheon , the world 's biggest missile manufacturer , on the Tamir , Iron Dome 's maneuverable , radar-guided interceptor .
Raytheon , headquartered at Waltham , Mass. , said in 2012 it would welcome the opportunity to partner Rafael on Iron Dome production .
Under the new arrangement , Raytheon would head a group of U.S. subcontractors for co-production of Tamir components and subsystems , with final assembly of the missile batteries carried out by Rafael in Israel .
Iron Dome is the only combat-tested component of a planned four-tier missile defense shield Israel is constructing .
Defense News reported a final agreement between the U.S. and Israel governments is expected within weeks .
U.S. lawmakers representing states with major defense industry links have long been pushing for co-production deals with Israel 's high-tech defense sector -- which has developed Iron Dome , along with David 's Sling and the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems dedicated to form the unique defense shield known as Homa , Hebrew for The Wall .
All the systems have been heavily financed by the United States .
The Arrow program , which has cost around $ 1 billion so far , dates back to the 1980s . Arrow 3 is being developed by state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries and the Boeing Co. of the United States .
Members of the U.S. House of Representatives demanded in April 2012 the United States get access to Iron Dome technology before approving $ 680 million in military aid to Israel from fiscal 2012 to 2015 , so it could acquire more batteries for the system , designed to intercept short-range rockets used by Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip .
The Pentagon has shown little interest in acquiring Iron Dome technology . But pressure has built from the House Armed Services Committee as U.S. defense budget cuts have built up significantly amid the threat of widespread closures in the defense industry .
Lawmakers claimed the United States had already invested nearly $ 900 million in Iron Dome development and production , including an upgraded variant , and should be allowed some rights to the system 's proprietary technology .
The new deal between Rafael and Raytheon , pending approval by Israel 's Defense Ministry and the U.S. Department of Defense 's Missile Defense Agency , could be a landmark development that will give U.S. defense companies access to Israeli technology on an unprecedented level .
`` We did n't start with Raytheon , '' said Pini Yungman , director of Rafael 's Missile Defense Systems Directorate . `` But after careful consideration we understood the strategic partnership that has proven itself with David 's Sling would provide the most benefit on Iron Dome and plans , in the future , to extend our activities for possible use by the U.S . Army . ''
Defense News reported David 's Sling 's two-stage Stunner interceptor could offer a low-cost alternative to the single-stage Patriot PAC-3 air-defense missiles built by Lockheed Martin .
Although successive U.S. administrations have provided substantial funding for the Israeli systems , all the key elements of Iron Dome , including the interceptor , its guidance system , radar and battle management system remain under Israeli ownership .
The Israelis , dependent on $ 3 billion in U.S. military aid a year , have been reluctant to share the rights on their missile-defense technology which has broken new ground in recent years .
There was little visible enthusiasm for sharing technology that could ultimately produce major export sales for Israel 's defense sector , which increasingly relies on exports to maintain production lines for the Israeli armed forces .
Possibly more important , those sales pay for research and development by Israelis firms that produces such weapons as Iron Dome , which the military says have destroyed 84.6 percent of all hostile missiles and rockets it has engaged since it became operational in early 2011 . Some Israeli missile experts question that kill rate .
Iron Dome constitutes the bottom tier of the Homa shield . David 's Sling is designed to counter medium-range weapons and cruise missiles .
IAI 's Arrow 2 is designed to counter Iranian and Syrian ballistic missiles at high altitude and long range . Arrow 3 will intercept ballistic weapons outside Earth 's atmosphere .
DPA A German actor dressed as Winnetou at the Karl May Museum in Radebeul . 'To Germans Winnetou is like Paul Bunyan , Abe Lincoln and Elvis rolled into one . '
The other day I found Jürgen Michaelis , a short , 50-year-old , beefy-handed man with a broad smile , standing by themselves inside a teepee not much bigger than a phone booth behind a house in this suburb of Dresden . A former locksmith and demolition worker from Chemnitz ( which used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt ) , Mr. Michaelis settled here a couple of years ago .
Gazing through inch-thick lenses and overjoyed to have a visitor , they showed off their homemade deerskin suit . Perched halfway on their head , about to tumble , was a matted black wig with a blue feather . At their feet burned a tiny charcoal fire , large enough to warm a single metal mug of water on a cold morning . A few forlorn trinkets rested on wood blocks , ostensibly for sale .
My Indian name ,  Mr. Michaelis told me , is Lonely Man.
A few months ago the director of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon , Tex. , told me in passing how their museum was frequently overrun by visiting Germans , so the curious German obsession with the Wild West  which newly arrived Americans repeatedly discover to predictable eye-rolling from Germans , for whom its hardly news  was not exactly unknown to me . Still , the extent of it is a little astonishing .
At powwows  there are dozens every year  thousands of Germans with an American Indian fetish drink firewater , wear turquoise jewelry and run around Baden-Württemberg or Schleswig-Holstein dressed as Comanches and Apaches . There are clubs , magazines , trading cards , school curriculums , stupendously popular German-made Wild West films and outdoor theaters , including one high in the sandstone cliffs above the tiny medieval fortress town of Rathen , in Saxony , where cowboys fight Indians on horseback . A fake Wild West village , Eldorado , recently shot up on the outskirts of Templin , the city where Angela Merkel , the chancellor , grew up .
The cause of this infatuation is a writer named Karl May ( 1842-1912 ) , virtually unknown in the United States but the most popular author in German history .
A con man and Walter Mitty-like homebody who spent eight years in jail dreaming of Wild West adventures , May ( the name is pronounced My ) wrote dozens of tall-tale books that have sold more than 100 million copies , maybe twice that many if you count translations from the German . Kaiser Wilhelm II , like May a fantasist who loved to dress up in exotic costumes , adored Mays books . So did Einstein and Albert Schweitzer , Kafka and Fritz Lang . Hitler did too .
Mays hero was Winnetou , a fictional Apache chief , a household name here . To Germans Winnetou is like Paul Bunyan , Abe Lincoln and Elvis rolled into one . During the World Cup last year , an occasion for the Germans to debate , as they often do , the pitfalls of reviving their nationalist spirit , Der Spiegel , the leading newsmagazine , published an article titled The Land of Winnetou.
There are the German poets and thinkers , the German forest , the German comfortableness ,  German efficiency , the German longing for Italy , and there is Winnetou ,  it pronounced . Winnetou is the quintessential German national hero , a paragon of virtue , a nature freak , a romantic , a pacifist at heart , but in a world at war they are the best warrior , alert , strong , sure.
Eleven Winnetous ,  the author , Dirk Kurbjuweit , added , referring to the German soccer team , and we would be world champions.
That was pretty much what Hitler told their troops when they distributed Mays books as object lessons ; never mind that May themselves had been a vocal pacifist .
Mr. Kurbjuweit also called Winnetou a German with a migration background ,  a phrase Ive heard used to describe Turks here . Tormented German intellectuals like to ponder whether Mays concept of an edelmensch ,  their term for a truly noble man , as they called Winnetou , has inspired more feelings of fraternity or of racial superiority in the country . An American today is likelier to wonder how May shaped German views of the United States over the last century .
Immensely ,  Johannes Zeilinger told me . A hand surgeon by day , Dr. Zeilinger , a 59-year-old May enthusiast , is the curator of a big Karl May exhibition at the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin .
May framed a popular image of North America , with Indians as a dying race , tragically killed off by fate and by the spread of a new empire ,  they said . The doctor ushered me toward a painting that shows Indians ambushing an oncoming train , trains having signified Manifest Destiny . In Mays books Winnetous loyal sidekick , Old Shatterhand , was a German émigré , a schoolteacher who went West , became a crack shot , had a deadly right jab and , not coincidentally , got work as a surveyor for a railroad company .
Dr. Zeilinger wouldnt go so far as to say that May demonized the United States , which clearly they didnt , although Hans Ottomeyer , the director of the museum , who wandered by to listen in on the conversation at that point , said : May taught Germans that America was a wild place . There were natives and intruders , and they taught us to be suspicious of intruders , half of whom are good , half are very bad. Like all German men , Mr. Ottomeyer , whos 61 , lapsed unbidden into recollections of reading Mays books as a boy . Children read them less today , they added . The West used to be on the border of the imagination ,  they said . Now its a place they see every day , full of conflict and catastrophe.
You might say that May has become a Rorschach of German identity . German natural sympathy for American Indians is rooted in ancient times , Dr. Zeilinger explained . The Roman historian Tacitus described German tribes as uncorrupted , primitive , fierce and at one with nature , a people on the edge of a corrupt and voracious empire . May tapped into that primordial Germanness and also into what became , by the mid-19th century , a growing interest in America and the wider world .
May wrote about the Orient and Africa , too , and , as with the West , claimed to be recounting their own experiences , going so far as to distribute photographs of themselves dressed up as Old Shatterhand or as Kara Ben Nemsi , Old Shatterhands doppelgänger in the Ottoman world . They finally made it to the United States at 66 , briefly scouring the wilds of Massachusetts and meeting their first Indian near Buffalo before retreating home to Saxony . When they confessed publicly to having cooked everything up , they pitched themselves as a homily about a brute turned noble man , the Winnetou myth given a fresh spin .
Dr. Zeilinger showed me a typed collection of Mays adventures in a vitrine of objects from the former East Germany . Communists banned May  too Christian , too popular with Hitler , they said  and they shuttered their house in Radebeul . The typed copies were Wild West versions of samizdat , lovingly made over hundreds of hours by a fan from smuggled May books .
Needing to sate long-standing appetites , East German officials concocted ersatz versions of May tales with imitation Winnetous , and they also filmed May-like adventures in Cuba and Yugoslavia that became runaway hits behind the Iron Curtain .
Mr. Michaelis , the Lonely Man , remembers growing up on these , and on the East German schoolbooks about Indians and the capitalist West .
It was a little bit of adventure , an escape and romantic ,  they recalled . From the books I saw it was a hard life being an Indian , and I identified with that . Indians could handle any situation with no resources , just like here . All this put the flame in me.
May was finally recuperated by the Communists during the mid-80s , their house reopened alongside a log cabin museum of Indian artifacts and stuffed animals . Rathen , the open-air theater , also got to restage Winnetou plays .
I caught one recently . Beyond slumbering fields of cows and castles , across the Elbe on a little rope-drawn ferry , then through a tiny gingerbread town and a forest of conifers and beech , I climbed into the sandstone cliffs to see The Treasure of Silver Lake. On a rainy afternoon a few hundred hardy children and elderly Germans sat outdoors , watching a Dolph Lundgren lookalike in war paint carrying a spear .
Back here in Radebeul , Mr. Michaelis acknowledged what has clearly evolved into a mix of American Indian and German identities . Im 75 percent Indian but still German ,  they said . They explained that while they love their teepee , they have lately taken up an offer to sleep in Karl Mays house because the traffic between Dresden and Meissen has been keeping them awake at night . Then they waved one hand . The Indians made these out of the cotton that perfidious Americans sold them ,  they said , meaning their teepee . This ones better . Its acrylic . From Saxony.
Lunchtime was approaching , and they recommended a saloon around the corner that sold buffalo burgers . They said they go there when they can afford to . Tonight hell be cooking on the fire .
Schnitzel ,  they said .
`` How can you prove that you exist ? Maybe we do n't exist ... ''
-- Vivi Orunitia , Final Fantasy 9
Halloween 's coming up , and out of the blue I got a notion to draw Nightmare and Plushtrap as Black Mages from Final Fantasy 9 , Mr. 288 and Vivi respectively . Because why not ? So I doodled this up quickly . It took maybe an hour and a half from pencil on paper to finished Photoshop colorization .
Actually , this is not quite out of the blue . The current Springaling story arc suddenly reminded me of the Black Mages in FF9 . Manufactured as soulless warriors , they were unleashed in various cities , where they wreaked havoc . But some were ensouled during the battles and became conscious . Frightened of what they saw , they fled the war . They gathered into a hidden village of their own , where they tried to make sense of their lives . As soon as things were looking up for them , it was discovered that they were constructed with limited lifespans , and in fact they were already dropping dead one by one . Garnet , Zidane , Vivi , and the others get all the attention , but the Black Mages have their own tragedy and rebirth .
I 'm not going to say just how tightly this fits in with the Springaling events . That story will play out in good time .
I 'm obsessed with Christmas movies and try to see every Christmas movie in theaters every year . There 's something about a holiday movie that really puts me in the spirit . I get a little giddy and emotional . I think we all wish for a Christmas like we see in the movies – even with the crazy family drama .
With that said , I 'm thrilled to introduce the newest Christmas film coming to theaters this year , The Man Who Invented Christmas . This film tells of the magical journey that led to the creation of Ebenezer Scrooge ( Christopher Plummer ) , Tiny Tim , and other classic characters from A Christmas Carol . Yes , it 's the most classic Christmas movie brought back to the big screen in a whole new way . Check out the trailer below and keep scrolling for an exciting Christmas giveaway that will have 5 winners !

The Tigers have six good starting pitchers , if you believe that Drew Smyly should be able to transition back to starting after a successful pitstop in the bullpen . Steamer projects all five of their current starters for at least +3 WAR next year , and it 's not at all crazy to think that Smyly will be a +2 to +3 WAR pitcher as a starter , given their track record and stuff . The desire to move Smyly back into the rotation meant that had someone to go . For the last few months , the rumored trade candidates have been Rick Porcello and Max Scherzer .
Those guys can officially unpack their bags , however , as the Nationals have solved the Tigers pitching problem by relieving them of Doug Fister instead . And they did it at a shockingly low price , considering that Fister is one of the game 's most underrated pitchers . But let 's deal with what they gave up first .
According to Chris Cotillo , the trade is a 3-for-1 , with the Nationals sending 22-year-old LHPs Robbie Ray and Ian Krol along with 25-year-old infielder Steve Lombardozzi to the Tigers in exchange for two years of Fister at arbitration prices . Ray is the primary piece of value here , as a young lefty with solid stuff who has already succeeded at Double-A , getting their walks under control for a 60 inning stint in the second half of the season . Combined with a velocity spike that saw them sitting in the low-to-mid 90s , Ray 's stock is up quite a bit from last year , and Baseball America just ranked them as the organization 's 5th best prospect heading into 2014 , though their pronounced platoon splits and previous control issues suggest they might end up in the bullpen eventually .
Krol and Lombardozzi are filler pieces essentially . Krol 's a hard throwing youngster who fits best as a lefty specialist , and probably should n't face good right-handers in critical situations at this point in their career . Lombardozzi 's a reserve infielder who is n't much of a hitter and does n't have enough glove to cover shortstop , so while he 's young , the upside is pretty limited . Maybe they grow into their power and develops into an okay second baseman in a few years , but for right now , he 's kind of a replacement level bench guy without a ton of value .
So , in exchange for Fister , the Nationals surrendered a non-elite pitching prospect who has pitched a half season at Double-A and probably wo n't rank in anyone 's Top 100 next spring , plus a couple of role players who might or might not end up amounting to anything . And in return , they 're getting two years of a very good starting pitcher at far below market prices . This trade is nothing short of a bonanza for the Nationals .
Seriously , look at where Fister stands relative to the game 's best pitchers over the last three years .
Those are the top 25 pitchers in baseball by RA9-WAR from 2011 to 2013 . Note that Fister ranks 13th , two spots ahead of Scherzer . They rank ahead of Zack Greinke , who got $ 150 million as a free agent last winter , and Anibal Sanchez , who got $ 85 million . He 's basically in a tie with Gio Gonzalez and Jordan Zimmermann , who have both finished in the top 10 in Cy Young voting over the last couple of years .
And that 's runs allowed , which penalizes Fister for having to pitch in front of the Tigers defense . By FIP-based WAR , Fister ranks 9th , right between David Price and Cole Hamels . This is not a case where out new fangled math has identified an undervalued pitcher who only looks good on FanGraphs and looks like crap by traditional metrics . By the things we value the most , Fister has been a top 10 pitcher in MLB over the last three years ; by the things that MLB has traditionally valued , he 's been a top 15 pitchers over the same time frame .
The easy comparison here is James Shields . A year ago , the Rays decided that they could n't afford the final two arbitration payouts for Shields , and put their strike-throwing change-up specialist on the market . In the three seasons prior to 2013 , Shields had thrown 680 innings with a 96/94/81 ERA-/FIP-/xFIP- line , putting up +10 WAR by either FIP or runs allowed based models . He 'd been better in the two more recent years , though , putting up an 81/89/79 line in 477 innings . They were a durable innings eater who had been at times among the most dominant right-handed starters in the game .
James Shields landed the Rays a kid named Wil Myers , who was rated as the game 's third best prospect heading into the 2013 season , and ended up winning Rookie of the Year . I was one of many who thought ( and still do think ) the deal was a massive overpay for the Royals , so the Tigers should n't have expected to land a Myers-style prospect for Fister , but you would think they could have gotten closer than this . Especially because Fister 's track record is even better than Shields ' was , as he 's put up +13 WAR over the last three years compared to Shields ' 10 WAR from 2010-2012 . Even if you just go past two years and exclude Fister 's excellent 2011 season , they still grade out as very comparable to Shields ' final two seasons before last winter 's trade .
And yet , the Nationals gave up a good-not-great pitching prospect , a lefty reliever , and a bench guy . Realistically , this is not that different from the return they got by trading away Michael Morse last winter , when they landed A.J . Cole ( now rated as their # 2 prospect by BA , ahead of Ray ) , Blake Treinen ( a fringy pitching prospect ) , and Krol , who is changing teams once again . A year ago , the Nationals flipped one year of an injury prone DH for this same kind of package of talent that is now netting them two years of one of the best starting pitchers in baseball .
This cost seems light even compared to other players traded with fewer years of team control on the books . Just this summer , the Rangers gave up four prospects of varying quality for Matt Garza , and it would n't be hard to argue that C.J . Edwards is a prospect of similar value to Ray , and that the secondary pieces in that deal are also superior to what the Tigers just got for Fister . And that was for a half season of a worse pitcher , and the mid-season trade meant that the Rangers were n't able to make Garza a qualifying offer . They paid a similar ( or maybe higher ) price for two months of Garza and no pick as to what the Nationals just paid for two years of Fister and the potential of a draft pick as compensation if they leaf after 2015 .
It 's not like that deal was the crazy outlier here either . The Red Sox gave up Jose Iglesias for the right to pay Jake Peavy about $ 18 million over 1 1/2 years ; Iglesias is probably a better return than the combination of talent Detroit just got for Fister , and Fister will make roughly $ 18 million over the next two full seasons . And again , Fister has been a lot better than Peavy .
We could keep running down the line all day . Two years of R.A. Dickey at $ 25 million cost the Blue Jays Travis D'Arnaud and Noah Syndergaard , both far better prospects than Robbie Ray . Fister is n't coming off a Cy Young season , but they just threw 209 terrific innings , and then gave the Tigers two very good starts in the playoffs .
Maybe it 's the fact that Fister 's fastball sits at 89 , or that they were a non-prospect for most of their days in the minor leagues , but barring an unknown injury that is about to wreck their value , it seems like 29 MLB teams are missing the boat on Doug Fister . If Fister were a free agent , he 'd have been the best starter on the market by a good margin . This is a market where $ 50 million for Ricky Nolasco is n't outrageous . As a free agent , I 'd have expected Fister to land something in the range of what Anibal Sanchez got last winter . Their market value is probably somewhere around $ 80 million for five years .
Instead , the Nationals will own their rights for the next two years at a grand total of less than $ 20 million , and the cost to acquire them was one decent pitching prospect and some filler . I do n't get it . Worse pitchers regularly cost far more , even with fewer years of team control . Are teams really still degrading pitchers based solely on fastball velocity , even after 800 innings of excellent Major League performance ? Is there reason to think that Fister , at age-29 , is about to magically stop pitching well ?
I get that the Tigers had too many starters . I get that selling low on Porcello or giving up Scherzer while trying to contend might not be great ideas either . Maybe Robbie Ray is going to turn into an ace , and the Tigers will have turned two years of a good pitcher into six years of a good pitcher . It 's certainly within the realm of possibility , and if Ray develops into a quality starter , this trade should work out just fine for the Tigers .
But that still looks like a pretty big if , given what we know about the success rates of pitching prospects , especially non-elite pitching prospects with some legitimate question marks . It seems to me that two valuable seasons of one of the game 's best pitchers should be worth more than one decent but unspectacular pitching prospect . It seems to me that MLB teams have been paying much higher prices to acquire quality starting pitching , and that the Nationals just got a total steal .
Maybe the Tigers and the 28 other teams who decided not to make a better bid for Fister know something that I do n't . Maybe they really are about to suck , after four years of being consistently above average , and with no obvious warning signs in sight . Maybe they spent the off-season burning down orphanages in third world countries and we just have n't heard about it yet .
Short of that , though , this just an outright robbery . In a market where the prices for mediocre pitchers are very high , the Nationals paid a moderate price for a very good pitcher . They might have had a disappointing 2013 season , but with Fister slotted in behind Strasburg , Gonzalez , and Zimermann , they 're going to be very tough to beat in 2014 .
AP Photo/Franklin Reyes YESTERDAY during the foreign-policy debate , Mitt Romney promised that as president , they would indict Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran , for incitement to genocide . One of Mr Romney 's senior advisors explained they had been referring to an indictment at the `` World Court '' —presumably meaning the International Criminal Court in The Hague , since the International Court of Justice does n't carry out criminal prosecutions of individuals . I 've been covering the international courts in The Hague for over a year , and I 've never heard of any case remotely like this being brought there ; so my first thought was that this was the sort of campaign nonsense nobody should pay any attention to . But then I thought , why not have a quick go at trying to understand what Mr Romney might have meant ? Would it actually be possible to charge Mr Ahmadinejad with incitement to genocide ?
So I called up Guénaël Mettraux , a lawyer I 've previously talked to while covering the trials of Charles Taylor , the former president of Liberia , and Ratko Mladic , the former Bosnian Serb military leader . Mr Mettraux has served as counsel for several defendants at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , and has consulted for the International Criminal Court and for the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia . They are the author of `` Perspectives on the Nuremberg Trial '' and `` The Law of Command Responsibility '' . ( I should note that they have a somewhat hard-bitten perspective on the way the international court system works , and thinks that the interests of relevant nation-states play a large role in deciding who goes to trial . )
Anyway , to summarise their answer : it 's not impossible . It 's just very , very unlikely to work . Here 's a lightly edited transcript of our interview .
MS : Do you have a take on whether it would be possible to charge Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with incitement to genocide ?
Guénaël Mettraux : It depends on the political will . Knowing the place of Iran in the world , the chance is close to zero . But look , every international criminal-law case depends on the alignment of the political stars . It 's not a matter of wanting to do it , or of the merit of the case , it 's whether it 's politically feasible .
MS : So how would that actually work ?
Guénaël Mettraux : There are two possible routes . One would be a national tribunal , a prosecutor in a national court who is willing to take on that case . Many jurisdictions could claim universal jurisdiction over such a crime . It might be in a country where there were people who could claim they were victims of the crime . Or alternatively , you would have an international tribunal that would be competent . There , you have two possibilities . Either you have an ad hoc tribunal [ like those set up to prosecute war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda - ed . ] , or else you would have a referral by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court to investigate the alleged crime of Mr Ahmadinejad .
MS : So you could in fact bring a case like this ?
Guénaël Mettraux : Well the problem with the crime in question is , you 'd have a hard time establishing that anyone truly is a victim at this stage . It 's highly theoretical , but imagine you have an Israeli citizen who is also a French citizen , or a group of them . They could go to the prosecutor of the ICC saying we are victims of Mr Ahmadinejad 's crime and we are citizens of a state party to the ICC , and therefore you have the power to investigate since the crime in question has no particular geographical location—a little statutory annoyance .
[ Ed . note : This part requires a bit of elucidation . Under the Rome statute establishing the ICC , the court has jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of any states that are parties to the treaty . The problem is , neither Iran , Israel , nor the US are parties to the treaty . The court can also investigate alleged crimes committed anywhere , if they 're referred by vote of the UN Security Council . But if America were unable to get the security council to approve a referral and nevertheless wanted to launch a case , Mr Mettraux wrote me in a subsequent email , it would probably need to do two things . First , it would need to claim that incitement to genocide was a crime with no geographical location , which could be said to be committed anywhere where the incitement was heard or broadcast . Then , since America is not a party to the Rome statute , it would need to find a proxy , either a state party or a citizen of a state party , to initiate a case . ]
Guénaël Mettraux ( cont 'd ) : An added issue with the crime of incitement is , it 's exceptional that it 's charged without the crime having actually been committed . If you look , for example , at the international tribunal for Rwanda , incitement to genocide was charged as a backup to charges of actual commission of genocide . If you ca n't prove the defendant actually committed or otherwise contributed to genocide himself , you charge them with incitement . Charging without actual commission is theoretically possible , but you would have a hard time proving that the crime was committed and worth prosecuting .
MS : But private individuals can actually initiate such charges at the ICC ?
Guénaël Mettraux : No , in the sense that they ca n't force a prosecution . They can send information to the prosecutor asking them to take steps to investigate the crime . They ca n't as citizens request the authorities to commence criminal prosecution . They can formalise a complaint to the prosecutor , and if the prosecutor is satisfied , they could theoretically take on such a case . The prosecutor has the competence to initiate a case proprio motu ( ie , on their own initiative ) . But the fact is , the prosecutor of the ICC has never done that up to this point . To date we have two sets of cases before the ICC : either a referral by the UN Security Council , as in Darfur or Libya , or a referral by a state party itself , as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the Central African Republic .
MS : And the fact that Iran is not a party to the ICC does n't affect things ?
Guénaël Mettraux : Well , the fact that Iran is n't a party to the Rome statute means one route of jurisdictional competence is closed . So you ca n't rely on that . But if you were to find a number of perpetrators or even victims who were nationals of a state party , subject to the little legal trick discussed before—namely , incitement to genocide is committed on the territory of any and every state , you could imagine initiating it on that basis . Creative , but where the mind is keen… .
MS : So , the point of this article is ... [ Explains Mitt Romney 's quick reference to indictment in yesterday 's debate ]
Guénaël Mettraux : Very interesting ! So now I can call up Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and offer them my services as defence counsel at the ICC !

A fraternity at Arizona State University decided to celebrate the national holiday honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King , Jr. , by being overtly racist .
The Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity at ASU held an unregistered party Sunday and dubbed it an `` MLK Black Party , '' according to CBS5 . Attendees wore basketball jerseys , drank from cups made out of watermelons and flashed gang signs for the camera .
The partygoers posted a number of photos on social media . Attendees included the following hashtags on their Instagram posts :
# myboymartin
# hood
# killem
# ihaveadream
# blackoutformlk
All of the people identified in the Instagram photos used by local media have since deleted their accounts .
The fraternity was already on `` social probation '' at the time of the incident , ASU spokesperson Sharon Keeler told the Phoenix New Times , meaning it was n't allowed to have parties .
Patrick Gleason , director of compliance and housing for the national TKE organization , told CBS5 they will meet with the ASU chapter and school officials `` to really flush out the details of this incident and get a full scope of what occurred . '' In the meantime , the university suspended all operations at the fraternity Monday , according to KTAR . An investigation is underway , CBS5 reports .
The Rev . Jarrett Maupin , an area civil rights activist , told KTAR that they were alerted to the party by a black invitee who said guests were instructed to `` dress like black people . ''
`` An estimated 80 to 100 people took part in ritualistic racism , '' Maupin told KTAR . `` That 's very dangerous especially on a university campus . A cup made out of a watermelon is advanced racism . Dressing up like , quote , 'black people ' -- that requires research and is advanced racism . We 're not talking about rookie racists . ''
The fraternity was only reinstated at the university last month . TKE was suspended after some of its members were part of a group of nearly 20 that started a brawl at an apartment complex in November 2012 .
If there 's any good news , it 's that several ASU students whom CBS5 spoke with instantly condemned the fraternity 's behavior , calling it offensive and ignorant .
UPDATE , 3:30 p.m. : Arizona State provided a statement to HuffPost condemning the actions of the fraternity :
Summer 's Eve is catching some flack for a series of ads that use hand puppets , titled vertically , to promote its line of feminine genital cleansing products . With three puppets , each portraying a different ethnicity with phrases like “ ” ay-yi-yi ” ( Latina ) and “ do you really want to be itchy down here ? Mmmmhmm ” ( African-American ) , and “ Just a little love for your vertical smile , ” ( Caucasian ) , for some viewers the clips are managing to hit that magical advertising sweetspot of being both sexist and racist .
The idea that a woman 's private parts require any additional cleaning products beyond soap and water is toxic to some women for various reasons . Products like this bottle of feminine body wash and the box of wipes can can be seen as unnecessary , unnatural , and just even another instance of society trying to convince women that they should be ashamed of parts of their bodies — and then selling them the product to solve the problem the advertisers themselves created .
What 's more , the products themselves are n't even that special . The wash is essentially just a very mild and lightly scented soap . The wipes are basically foil-wrapped baby wipes , or obstetrical wipes . You can get a box of 100 obstetrical wipes for $ 2.15 . You can get a handi-pack of 16 Summers Eve Feminine Cleansing Cloths for $ 2.89 at Amazon . That 's 17.6 cents a wipe vs 2.2 cents a wipe . Just on the basis of math , Summer 's Eve washes are silly products .
But if you need more reasons to dislike them , there 's plenty . “ Summer 's Eve , already guilty of making women feel like their lady bits are dirty and smelly , in need of flushing out and cleaning with special , clarifying soap , has really done it this time , ” writes Lexa on the MoxieBird blog . “ I thought their products hated women enough , frankly , but they will not be deterred in their woman hating ways . The ads are so flagrantly awful , my head is spinning that they made the air . ”
Commenter Grace on that site writes , “ My Mexican vagina acts nothing like that and does not own a leopard thong ( but I may have to look out for one ) . These are awful . I am not sure what language my vagina speaks but either way I do n't like this . No me gusta . ”
Those reactions certainly are n't what Summer 's Eve had in mind when they designed the campaign . Summer 's Eve Director of U.S. Marketing Angela Bryant told AdRants , “ The whole category has been talking to women the same way since feminine hygiene products have been in the marketplace , and ironically , many media outlets wo n't even allow the use of the word vagina in advertising . We are way past-due for a change . Hearing from women on our listening tour last year cemented that now is the time . This campaign is about empowerment , changing the way women may think of the brand , and removing longstanding stigmas : Summer 's Eve is not a means to confidence , rather it 's a celebration of confidence , of being a woman , and taking care of their bodies . ”
Here are the ads so you can see for yourself whether they really connected with their user feedback or whether it 's a swing and a miss .

Pin collectors , rejoice ! A new limited edition pin set just debuted straight from the mystical land of Pandora .
This time the collection features the travel posters for the new land that is soon to open in Disney 's Animal Kingdom , Pandora — The World of Avatar .
The pins are the first bit of merchandise to be released as part of the “ countdown collection ” –a collection put together to help build anticipation for the land 's opening and help guests connect with the experience .
Erin Herbst , merchandiser for Disney Pins , explains :
With the addition of this new land to Disney 's Animal Kingdom , we wanted a way to continue the excitement leading up to the grand opening . This countdown pin collection features the beautiful travel posters created by Alpha Centauri Expeditions , the exclusive provider of tours to Pandora . We thought guests would love collecting these posters as they prepare to journey to another world .
A new pin is scheduled for release every month from now until May when Pandora debuts . The first pin–one that portrays a family walking through a bioluminescent forest–has been released today .
The second pin , which pictures floating mountains over the heads of visitors , releases on April 6 . And the final pin , portraying a family walking through the wonder of Pandora , will release on May 4 . All of the pins have an edition size of 1,250 and will be available for purchase at Discovery Trading Company .
There are two other pins that complete the set ; however , those pins will only be available in the boxed set that releases on Pandora 's opening day , May 27 . The “ completer pins ” will be a bit more challenging to get ahold of since the edition size is limited to 250 and they will only be available in the park .
In case you did n't pick up on it , the travel posters that inspired the collection have been up for some time on the construction walls that block passageway to Pandora in Animal Kingdom .
Works of beauty that they are , we are still very excited that those walls coming down soon ! C'mon May 27 !

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan savaged critics of their remarks that Muslim explorers traveled to the Americas before Columbus as suffering from an “ ego complex , ” reaffirming their belief their purported feat was an historical fact .
“ I have been the target of heavy criticism by the Western media , ” Erdoğan said during an address at a meeting of Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation ( COMCEC ) in Istanbul .
“ Just because I repeated a fact based on scientific research , I have been targeted by the Western media , and the foreigners inside us , who suffer from an ego complex , ” they said , in an apparent jab at pro-Western Turks .
Erdoğan , who has been in power for more than a decade , stirred controversy this month by declaring that the Americas were discovered by Muslims in the 12th century , nearly three centuries before Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic .
The firebrand president , whose claim was widely mocked in Turkish and international media , insisted the criticism was aimed at preventing Muslims from “ questioning anything . ”
“ They have been very disturbed by the fact that we have reminded them of some historical facts , the history of civilization , science , politics and war , ” they said .
“ They do n't want us to question anything , ” Erdoğan said . “ Believe me , they do n't like us . ”
Erdoğan cited as evidence for their claim that “ Columbus mentioned the existence of a mosque on a hill on the Cuban coast ” and offered to build a mosque at the site mentioned by the Genoese explorer .
Most history books say that Columbus set foot on the American continent in 1492 as they were seeking a new maritime route to India .
A tiny minority of Muslim scholars have recently suggested a prior Muslim presence in the Americas , although no pre-Columbian ruin of an Islamic structure has ever been found .
In a controversial article published in 1996 , historian Youssef Mroueh refers to a diary entry from Columbus that mentions a mosque in Cuba . But the passage is widely understood to be a metaphorical reference to the shape of the landscape .

Our children tend to be late talkers . However , they have always founds ways to communicate their needs regardless of the spoken word . But to ease the struggle and frustration both for our kids and for ourselves , we have aimed to work on using sign language to better converse with our tiny tots .
In researching curriculum and resources for my kindergartener on Timberdoodle , I stumbled across their tiny tots collection . And in it I found 50 sign language cards to help families work on establishing great communication even before young kids can actually verbalize what they need and want .
I was thrilled to be sent the collection of Teach Your Baby to Sign cards after they reached out to me because it was exactly what we needed . My nearly two year old who had around 6-8 spoken words , now signs consistently and even says many of the signs we have taught her !
Surprisingly , they have never even said the word no yet .
Instead , we have tried to equip them with more specific , powerful , and provoking words .
9 powerful words every young baby and toddler should know
Stop
This is my second child 's very favorite word . It was also their first consistent word and to be honest it impressed me and relieved me .
They asserted themselves enough to know when to set a boundary with their older sister and made it clear as to exactly what they wanted .
We also use the sign because in situations say where we ca n't speak to each other like in a movie theater , in a danger situation , or when it could wake someone in the house , a simple sign is sufficient and powerful enough to get the kids to halt where they are or quit what they 're doing .
Hurt
As the guide on the back of our sign language card suggests , this sign can be made generically or over a place where your child has an “ owie ” . When they 're so little it 's sometimes hard to understand when and where your child hurts and this simple sign made with two taping fingers can be so helpful !
Help
It 's always so sweet and special to see my toddler wave me over and ask for help . After using the adapted version of the sign on the baby sign cards , they quickly began saying help both with and without the sign.And it 's now their second favorite word behind stop .
Which means our frustration fell dramatically . They could say help and point to something and it immediately made sense versus just crying over the situation .
Hot
I have to admit , my kids knew this word before we ever use the sign . And my mom taught my youngest this word and it 's their most articulate one yet with a gasp “ HAUUGHHHTTTT ” .
Teaching this word and sign is both for safety 's sake and also to help kids who have hard time regulating and adjusting to temperatures . Sometimes my youngest just wants to cuddle when they feel hot , but it only makes them hotter . So communicating the need has helped tremendously .
Bed
As suggested on the back of our sign language cards , we use the gesture of placing both hands together under our head when asking if they are ready for bed . This has taught them to sign bed when they are tired or even when they feel the need to just rest or retreat from the craziness in the house .
Eat
With a flattened “ O ” and fingertips placed against the mouth , my kids let me know they 're hungry . We have always used this one for “ eat ” and “ food ” and it 's an easy spoken word to learn , especially paired with the sign .
Drink
We try to differentiate between water and other drinks . And while I would use the sign for thirsty ( also included in the set ) drink is easier to decipher for us and our young kids .
Go
This is an empowering word and sign for young kids to know because when they have had enough of something or somewhere they can easily let you know they need a break or want to leave .
Cold
I prefer to not let my kids get to the chattering teeth stage before understanding they are really cold . So we usually teach signs like this with hot and cold games to easily communicate temperature changes with physical touch and understanding of a somewhat abstract concept .
Extra words that are helpful and fun for young toddlers
Book
Of course a young child might come throw a story in your lap , but knowing this sign can also indicate some quiet time or they can let you know they want another book before bed .
Dance
In our house , this sign does n't just mean dance , it means our children want to listen to music , make music , and play !
Bath
There have been many times in my parenting journey that I have instituted an afternoon bath with my young toddlers because they 're cranky . Teaching them this sign can both help you understand if they feel dirty/sticky , if they want to play in water , or just need a time to wind down because of the warm water .
Water
While not in the set of cards we got , this is a sign that we have used with both kids regularly . It 's a “ w ” tapped to the chin . My youngest uses their pinger , taps their nose , and says “ waaahh ” .
In the end , we know what they are saying because they are adapting both the signs and sounds they have to convey the need to us !
More for your toddler !
Well , we 've solved our latest credit card validation problem and it seems like a good time to give a quick recap of the lessons we 've learned during this whole sordid process . Things that nobody bothers to tell you , not even the people you 're paying to do just that . This is 2008 , but credit card processing is a technological throwback to the Dark Ages .
Things nobody bothers to tell you , version 1 :
The web sites for credit card processors & merchant account services are completely useless . Do not try to use them , not even the big fish that everybody respects ( e.g . Authorize.net ) . You will only waste your time . Instead , call their tech support . We 've found their human support to be unfailingly friendly and helpful , at least when it comes to answering direct questions rather than making suggestions ( hence the Stuff Nobody Tells You ) . The hold music 's so beyond awful it enters into laughable , though . If you want to process AmEx , you have to call them directly , set up an account with them , and then talk to your merchant account service . Just because your CC processor 's interface shows you that AmEx is active , and your merchant account people tell you that everything is systems go , does n't mean there are n't hidden things you have to do to , you know , actually process cards . Or that the errors will be helpful . Address verification ( AVS ) is voodoo . Not real science . AVS is inclined to reject real , valid cards all the time , even when you do n't count “ user errors ” ( e.g . your bill says Apt 4 and you put # 4 ) . D'oh . Test charges are pretty much unavoidable . So , since AVS essentially does n't work , the way to verify a card is to make a tiny charge on it and then void the transaction . It 's not a charge you 'll ever collect on , but it 's not exactly a hold either . To us , it 's a bit squicky to think that this is the only way to verify a credit card number in this , the 21st century . Some banks will reject small test charges . About 10 % of cards used to sign up were declined . Thanks to Stuff item # 6 , we could n't tell why from the error reports . Nobody could tell us why , either . We called Auth.net and they had no suggestions . We only found out as fast as we did because one would-be customer , our friend ( & tasty designer ) Johnny Bilotta , called their own bank to ask if there was a problem . Trying to be considerate internet citizens , we had set our test charge to $ .01 . Their bank told them they reject small test charges under $ 1.00 , but our credit card processor never thought about it . Even though it 's their business . Useless buggers . Errors are incomprehensible and your credit card processor is useless at helping you solve validation issues . The error you 'll get in most cases is General error . In other cases , you may get Declined , but there 's no way to tell why . Calling your CC processor wo n't help you , either , because in many cases , they ca n't get more information than you 've already got . In other cases the phone reps just are n't trained in spotting what must be common problems ( e.g . the low test charge ) . When you ask why stuff does n't work , even due to Stuff Nobody Told You , they think you 're kinda dumb . Despite the support being , as we said , unfailingly friendly , there are always these awkward pauses when we 've asked about Stuff Nobody Told Us . For example , when we called and said “ So our account says we can accept AmEx but they 're all being rejected . Can you help us ? ” The nice lady asked , “ Well , are you set up for AmEx with your merchant services provide ? ” and I said “ No , what do you mean ? ” Awkward pause ensues . The lady assumes they are speaking with a polite nitwit and then the rest of the conversation takes twice as long as it would have if they had n't thought I had a room temperature IQ . Which is too bad , because there 's no documentation or on-ramping process that tells you this , and nobody thought to mention it , either , when I asked if I made the calls to both Auth.net & the merch acct people to ask “ Hey , we 're going to live . Do we have everything in place ? ” last week .
That 's all for now , but I 'm sure there will be more .
Cybersecurity Expert Is Convinced Russia Was Behind DNC Hacking
Donald Trump has said the source of the Democratic Party hack is hard to prove . Cybersecurity expert Matt Tait was initially skeptical , but tells David Greene they are sure now the culprit was Russia .
DAVID GREENE , HOST :
President-elect Donald Trump chastised the U.S. intelligence community again last night . In a tweet , they put intelligence in quotation marks and suggested they delayed a briefing for them on allegations of Russian hacking because more time is needed to build a case .
RACHEL MARTIN , HOST :
Not exactly . According to our colleague Mary Louise Kelly , who covers intelligence , an official told her , quote , `` the so-called Russia report was ordered by the White House . It has to go to President Obama first . '' Obama gets the briefing Thursday , Trump on Friday .
GREENE : Now , Russia has denied carrying out this hack . And Donald Trump , without offering evidence , has fed those doubts since the campaign .
( SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING )
DONALD TRUMP : Once they hack , if you do n't catch them in the act you 're not going to catch them . They have no idea if it 's Russia or China or somebody . It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace .
GREENE : And we spoke to a cybersecurity expert who initially doubted Russian involvement as well . Matt Tait is CEO of Capital Alpha Security , a British cybersecurity firm . I asked them why they were skeptical .
MATT TAIT : Well , it just seems too fantastical to be true . Russia has very good hackers . You know , this is a government agency . So initially what I did was I decided I 'm going to go and prove Crowdstrike wrong .
GREENE : They were hired by the Democratic National Committee , we should say , to look into this .
TAIT : Absolutely , and so I basically went through all of the technical evidence that had been published by them . I looked through the malware signatures that they had come up with . And eventually , what you start to discover is that there 's a very large number of little pieces of information , some of which point towards Russia . Some of them point towards Russia very , very strongly . And eventually , I came to the conclusion that there 's no other reasonable conclusion that you can make .
GREENE : Why could n't it have been , like , any Joe Blow ( ph ) , someone sitting in their bed , as Donald Trump suggested , masquerading as Russia and , you know , putting on a good disguise here ?
TAIT : So there are two different hacks that took place . There 's one hack that was of the DNC , and there was a different hack of John Podesta . And there 's a ...
GREENE : Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairperson , yeah .
TAIT : Absolutely . And there 's a series of other smaller hacks of other Democratic members . But those are the two main hacks that took place . And the DNC hack used malware . It hacked into the DNC and placed malware on the DNC network . And we 're able to look at this malware , and we 're able to analyze it and see where it talks to , which other companies have been hacked by similar malware .
And quite quickly , we 're able to see that this is malware that was communicating with servers that also were involved in the hack of the German parliament , the Bundestag . And one of the things that was very interesting is that this is a group that we know quite well in the cybersecurity industry . There 's this group called APD 28 . They 're very prolific . They 've been involved in the hack of NATO organizations . They 've been involved in the hack of journalists . They 've been involved in the hack of people investigating the MH17 airline that was shot down in Ukraine . And so this is a group that is so prolific that it 's not really credible that this is an individual group .
GREENE : If , I mean , Russia 's really good at this , would n't they disguise themselves better ? Would Russia really want to put so many visible signs out there in the cybersecurity world that it was them and be identified ?
TAIT : Right . So this was n't deliberate . They accidentally leaked this . And this is one of the problems of when you 're hacking at a really big scale . You look for efficiencies . You 're - there 's just not enough members of staff that Russia has in order to be able to do hacks on this kind of scale and make sure that they never screw up . And what happens is that people make small mistakes , which means that once - when they 've hacked person A you might be able to say , well , that 's , you know , the same group . They 've used the same malware . They 've used same control infrastructure as the hack of person B .
Once you start to discover that , you know , there 's not just the DNC , there 's , you know , a thousand other people that have been hacked , all of whom are very narrowly tied to Russian military interests - they 're hacks of NATO ; they 're hacks of the German parliament ; they 're hacks of journalists that are reporting on things that Russia is not , you know , very happy are being reported on - you stop quite quickly to build up this picture where in order for it to be someone else , it really has to be someone that is prolific who is doing this full-time . There 's nobody else who would be willing to put that sort of cash , that sort of effort into doing those types of hacks .
GREENE : But you said something very important there . You 're saying that Russia , in your words , screwed up here .
TAIT : Absolutely . And this is normal . It 's actually very common that we see mistakes in malware , we see mistakes in hacking campaigns which allow us to work out who it was that did this .
GREENE : Let me finish with this . I mean , another major cybersecurity firm , Kaspersky Lab , very respected - we should mention Kaspersky is an NPR funder , and we do work with them on our computers . But they said that there can be false flags . There can be a lack of reliable metrics .
And Americans have gone through a situation with the Iraq War where there was talk of weapons of mass destruction . The intelligence community was - their credibility was really called into question after that . But a president took this nation to war based on intelligence . I mean , are you absolutely certain here , or could we find later on down the road that there was some amazing hacker out there who was able to pull this off and make it look like Russia ?
TAIT : So one of the pieces of evidence that , to me , is more compelling than any other one was an email that was sent to John Podesta saying , hey , we 're from Google , you need to change your password . And they sent them a link for them to click on . And when they clicked on that link , it took them to a page that was n't Google and asked them to input their password . And that 's how they hacked their account . But the URL shortening service that they used , we 're able to basically look at the user that was logged in and discover all of the other URLs that they were shortening and discover that this was not just a hack of John Podesta .
It was a hack of , you know , a thousand people . And it becomes immediately , once you look at this , incredible to suggest that this was a false flag operation . This is someone 's entire intelligence operation that was accidentally exposed due to this one error . And so while false flag operations do exist and we have to always be on the lookout for them , the only plausible alternative explanation is that Russian intelligence was hacked . So it 's not credible to suggest that this particular hack was a false flag operation .
GREENE : It 's impossible that Russia 's intelligence community was hacked .
TAIT : So in attribution , nothing is impossible . But this is about as impossible as it comes .
GREENE : OK. Matt Tait is founder and CEO of Capital Alpha Security , a cybersecurity firm in Britain . And we reached them via Skype . Matt , thanks a lot .
TAIT : Thank you very much .
GREENE : And we should also note here that Kaspersky Lab , whose doubts about the hack that we cited , has its headquarters in Moscow .

WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats blocked passage Tuesday of a Homeland Security spending bill that would have derailed President Obama 's order to protect about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation .
Senators voted 51-48 on a procedural motion to bring the bill to the Senate floor , falling short of the 60 votes needed . Republican Dean Heller of Nevada joined with unanimous Democrats and independents to block the bill .
Unless a compromise on a new bill can be reached by the end of the month , funding for the Department of Homeland Security will expire and the agency will face a partial shutdown .
It 's not clear what Republican leaders in the House and Senate will do now .
One option being discussed is to pass another short-term funding extension to prevent the looming DHS shutdown and postpone the showdown over immigration policy .
House Republican leaders are moving toward taking other action that might placate immigration hard-liners in the GOP caucus while allowing the House to pass a DHS funding bill without any immigration amendments attached .
House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , told Republicans last week that they were taking the first steps toward suing the president to challenge the constitutionality of their immigration actions .
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul , R-Texas , has introduced a border security bill that requires federal officials to gain `` operational control '' of the border . Meanwhile , House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte , R-Va. , is working on immigration enforcement bills , including one to require employers to use the E-Verify electronic verification system to ensure their employees are eligible to work legally in the U.S .
`` In the coming weeks , this committee will hold hearings and address legislation that deals with the problem of the administration 's failure to enforce our immigration laws , '' Goodlatte said at a committee hearing Tuesday . `` We will not only provide the administration with the tools it needs ; we will also act to ensure that the president can not unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement in this country . ''
Tuesday 's Senate battle over the $ 40 billion funding bill focused on House-passed amendments that would cut off funding for Obama 's latest immigration order and end their 2012 program that provided protection from deportation and work permits for undocumented immigrants brought to the USA as children .
Republicans say Obama overstepped their authority in November when they announced they would effectively give temporary legal status to some undocumented parents of U.S. citizens . The action would allow them to get work permits and someday receive Social Security and Medicare benefits if they work long enough and pay into the Social Security system .
The president expanded their 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program . The program has helped about 600,000 young immigrants — who call themselves `` DREAMers '' — by allowing them to stay in the country for at least two years and obtain work permits .
`` At its core , this debate is about whether Democrats think presidents of either party should have the power to simply do what they want , '' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , said Tuesday as they urged senators to pass the bill . `` And while this is about more than just President Obama , it 's also true that President Obama has repeatedly reached beyond their authority . ''
Obama said they have the legal authority to take executive action . They said they did so only after the House failed to take up a major immigration bill last year . The Senate passed a bipartisan overhaul of the immigration system in the last Congress .
Democratic senators said Republicans are willing to risk the nation 's security to satisfy their right wing .
`` While ISIS is declaring they 're determined to 'reach America , ' Republicans are playing politics with our national security , '' Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , said Tuesday .
Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Tuesday that the department can not do its job if a funding bill is not approved by Congress . The department is currently operating under a temporary resolution passed by Congress late last year that funds DHS at 2014 levels through the end of this month .
Johnson said the agency , as long as it is operating under the temporary budget , can not give federal grants to states , local governments and tribes to buy new communications equipment for police , improve campus security at colleges and universities , upgrade oxygen masks for firefighters or pay for police dogs to help detect explosives .

`` The Department of Homeland Security contains numerous agencies that every single day are keeping the American people safe , '' Obama said Tuesday .
`` They 're our front lines at our borders , at our airports , along our coasts . And they need certainty in order to do their jobs . ''

The NBA Development League will be renamed the NBA Gatorade League ( NBA G-League ) as part of a multiyear partnership between the NBA and Gatorade , which will begin with the 2017-18 season .
This is the first deal between a U.S. professional sports league and an entitlement partner .
As part of the deal , a new NBA G-League logo will be featured on new game balls , team jerseys , on-court signage and digital properties . G-League teams will also have assistance from the Gatorade Sports Science Institute to collaborate with programs to enhance player sports performance and recovery .
• Breakaway Podcast : Exploring The NBA From The Inside Out
“ This expansion of our NBA partnership is a great opportunity to not only work with the elite athletes of the NBA G-League , but also continue to lead the evolution of basketball performance , ” Gatorade Senior Vice President and General Manager Brett O'Brien announced .
A true hometown hero . Melania Trump 's hometown of Sevnica , Slovenia , has planned three days of celebration to memorialize their new status as first lady of the United States .
“ We want to mark it with nice , appropriate products , ” Sevnica mayor Srecko Ocvirk told The Associated Press . Ocvirk said that locally produced goods and brands will be on display in the 12th-century castle above the old town , including everything from locally made sausages and wine to a line of women 's slippers from Sevnica 's Kopitarna shoe factory .
The three-day celebration will also include free guided tours throughout the industrial town , which has a population of 5,000 people . ( Slovenia itself has a population of about 2 million people . ) A website promoting Slovenia tourism even now reads : “ Welcome to the homeland of the new First Lady of the United States of America ! ”
According to the Associated Press , Trump , 46 , has already hired a law firm in Slovenia to protect their name and image from being used on some unauthorized products that have begun to surface there .
The former model has come a long way from their humble roots . The new first lady left their small town in their 20s to pursue a modeling career . It is believed that the last time they visited home was in July 2002 , when they brought Donald Trump back to meet their parents . ( The pair married in January 2005 . )
On Friday , Melania turned heads in a powder-blue Ralph Lauren cashmere jacket and matching turtleneck dress for the swearing-in ceremony itself and then in a stunning white Carolina Herrera dress that showed off their figure .
The first lady also made headlines for their awkward exchange with Michelle Obama as the outgoing president and the former first lady greeted them and Donald Trump on the White House steps . In the moment seen around the world , Melania handed Michelle , 53 , a blue Tiffany & Co. box , leaving the former first lady uncertain of where to hide the present as the foursome took an official photo .
It was Barack Obama who finally came to Michelle 's rescue upon seeing how flustered they are , taking the box from them and telling the group , “ Hold on sec . We will take care of protocol . ”

The Illinois General Assembly and Gov . Pat Quinn saved the state 's 2014 horse racing season today in a photo finish , voting to extend by three years the betting law that partially funds the sport 's regulatory board .
The law , known as Advanced Deposit Wagering , allows Illinois residents to bet on races online and was set to expire Jan. 31 . Those in the local racing industry had been pushing for months for pension-focused state lawmakers to extend the bill for three years , to no avail .
But after Gov . Quinn 's annual State of the State address today in Springfield , the bill made it to the floor in both the Senate and House , which approved it 47 to 4 and 95 to 10 , respectively .
Mike Campbell , president of the Illinois Thoroughbred Horsemen 's Association , thanked lawmakers for saving their full racing season in a statement after today 's votes :
`` ( We ) thank Gov . Pat Quinn , Senate President John Cullerton and House Speaker Michael Madigan , as well as other legislative leaders and lawmakers , for their attention to this matter and ongoing consideration for the interests of Illinois horsemen , '' the statement said .
Under the law , money from online wagers goes to the Illinois Racing Board , which regulates the state 's horse racing industry . The IRB hires judges and the other officials tracks must have to legally run horse races and take bets .
Without an extension of the law and the $ 725,000 that comes with it , harness racing at tracks like Maywood and Balmoral parks would have been decimated ( there would be none at Maywood ) and thoroughbred racing at sites like Arlington International Racecourse in Arlington Heights and Hawthorne Racecourse in Cicero also would have been dramatically reduced .
It also would have meant the scrapping of thousands of full-time and seasonal jobs at racetracks around the state .
`` We can now focus on maintaining unity and working to rebuild racing and create new opportunities that will bring more jobs and revenue to the state for the long term , '' Arlington Park President Tony Petrillo said in a statement .
There has been some speculation as to whether Dylann Roof is insane , or was so at the time of the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston , South Carolina . Certainly the amount of premeditation that went into the mass murder they planned and perpetrated should make us wary about accepting too readily the assertion that they were crazy . But while we might wonder about Roof , there is no doubt at all that for its commentary on this horrific , hate-filled crime Fox News should be indicted in the court of public opinion for its role in this and other racist acts . The network surely was conscious of what it was doing in aiding and abetting ; it surely planned to furnish Roof with an alibi regarding the exact nature of their heinous crime .
Indeed , if Roof is convicted I suggest we regard Fox as an accessory after the fact : someone who assists another 1 ) who has committed a felony , 2 ) after the person has committed the felony , 3 ) with knowledge that the person committed the felony , and 4 ) with the intent to help the person avoid arrest or punishment . An accessory after the fact may be held liable for , inter alia , obstruction of justice .

I do n't care to debate whether the Fox commentators are sincere when they voice their corrosive ideas , or if it is simply a matter of a herd mentality that kicks in when more than one of them is in a room and the klieg lights are on , but there is no denying that they and Fox make money off this . This is a classic example of sensationalistic yellow journalism . And it 's worse , because it is also ideologically driven and it perpetuates a racist ideology .
How else could Steve Doocy opine on Fox News that it was “ extraordinary ” that the Charleston church shooting was called a hate crime ? How else can Fox wonder if it had a racial element to it when Roof is on record as saying during the shooting that they wanted to kill black people because they are “ taking over ” ?
This combination of warped mentality , groupthink and profiting off tragedy is the hallmark of Fox , but the poison of its commentators is effective because is taps into a history of white supremacist belief that appears widely and perniciously in many guises .
Fox provides a support system for hatred , and in this instance its collaborators include people like Rick Santorum , who in a craven act of opportunism turns a racist attack into an attack on , what else , themselves and their political base , the religious right ; Lindsey Graham , who argues the same and defends flying the Confederate flag as a sign of Southern pride and defiance ; Rick Perry , who called the shooting an “ accident ” ( OK , they have now corrected that — they say they meant “ incident , ” but what an interesting Freudian slip ) ; and those in the NRA who make this about their cause , the right to own arms . Apparently it 's about everything except race , and , more specifically , white supremacy . I would call this mutual support system that radiates out from the cesspool of Fox News the “ Larger Fox Network . ”
This network has been particularly active ever since the election of Barack Obama to the presidency , and has adopted the rhetoric and vocabulary , and reasoning , of age-old white supremacy . As David Remnick points out ,
the words attributed to the shooter are both a throwback and thoroughly contemporary : one recognizes the rhetoric of extreme reaction and racism heard so often in the era of Barack Obama . Their language echoed the barely veiled epithets hurled at Obama in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns ( “ We want our country back ! ” ) and the raw sewage that spewed onto Obama 's Twitter feed ( @ POTUS ) the moment they cheerfully signed on last month . “ We still hang for treason do n't we ? ” one @ jeffgully49 , who also posted an image of the President in a noose , wrote . South Carolina has undergone enormous changes in the decades since Jim Crow , but it is hard to ignore the setting of this rampage , the atmosphere . Seven years ago , as Obama was campaigning in South Carolina , the Times columnist Bob Herbert visited the state , encountering the Confederate flag flying on the grounds of the State Capitol building and , nearby , a statue of Benjamin ( Pitchfork Ben ) Tillman , a Reconstruction-era governor and senator , who defended white supremacy and the lynching of African-Americans , saying , “ We disenfranchised as many as we could . ”
Now , in the face of all this , it is heartening to see so much strong , smart , righteous commentary pouring out , in both the mainstream media and from other sources . My concern , however , it that after this “ story cycle ” wanes , what will be the lasting effect ? Make no mistake , the Larger Fox Network will still be intact , still spewing its garbage and hatred . We need to do something about that .

As one part of the response I would look to our schools — they are one of our last institutions wherein racism can be exposed in all its forms , critiqued , and fought against . And those truly sincere about their abhorrence of what happened at Charleston should be prepared to look deep into their own souls , and behaviors .
By many accounts , this is not going to be easy . Recently Lee Bebout , a professor at Arizona State University , was viciously attacked by white supremacist groups for offering a course titled “ US Race Theory and the Problem with Whiteness , ” and again Fox played a major role in fanning the flames of racist reaction :
The class , which began on Jan. 12 , received national attention Jan. 23 when Fox News correspondent Elisabeth Hasselbeck called the course `` quite unfair , and wrong and pointed '' on Fox & Friends . Lauren Clark , an ASU junior who is not in the class or in the English program , said on the show that the class `` suggests an entire race is the problem . '' The segment ignited a media frenzy , and Bebout began receiving hate mail the day it aired , according to a police report . Over the next two months , Bebout received at least 70 hostile e-mails from opponents of the class , according to records provided by ASU .
As a young student not in the class or even in the English program ( and that might explain a lot ) Ms. Clark should probably not be faulted too much for reading past the actual title of the course -- it was “ whiteness , '' not “ whites ” — but the fact that the supposed adults at Fox could not manage to think twice , or simply think , is telling . Again , it was more to their interest to drum up hatred based on a false charge , and sit back as the situation got uglier and more violent .
On Jan. 29 , someone distributed fliers on the driveways of Bebout 's and others ' homes in their neighborhood with `` Anti-White '' printed over their face and reading `` Arizona State University is Anti-White , '' according to Tempe police . The act of putting the flier on Bebout 's driveway constituted misdemeanor harassment , the report said . The fliers were labeled `` National Youth Front . '' NYF is a `` youth organization dedicated to the preservation of all White people , '' according to the website for the group , which has a Phoenix chapter of unknown size . The group is characterized as a `` newly formed youth wing of the White nationalist American Freedom Party '' by the Southern Poverty Law Center , an Alabama-based civil-rights organization… In February , commenters on white-supremacist websites posted a photo of Bebout with their family , along with disparaging comments , their contact information and other personal details .
One should note that Dylann Roof was enamored of such groups .

Three years ago , in 2012 , CNN ran a story titled “ Has ‘ whiteness studies ' run its course in colleges ? ” The question was prompted by the fact of Obama 's election and what that supposedly signaled : a “ post-racial ” era . But its conclusion is what is most interesting now , as we contemplate Charleston , McKinney , Texas , and Ferguson , Missouri , and all the other recent manifestations of virulent racism :
Some believe the idea of racism is shifting entirely . A 2008 poll by USA Today/Gallup and showed that 40 % of adults in America think racism against white people is widespread in the United States . A study published last year said that whites increasingly believe that bias against whites is a bigger problem than bias against blacks .
The mass murders at Charleston , and certainly what happened in McKinney , show that this skewed reasoning is on the rise , and the Larger Fox Network is doing all it can to profit from this . And this means that we need to develop a strong and consolidated set of strategies to fight it . Besides strengthening anti-racist education , we need to turn to the rest of the media , outside Fox and its ilk .
This is absolutely essential ; mainstream and other news venues must not weaken their attention to the systemic nature of racism in America . We need to continue to file our commentaries consistently , and have our voices heard . We need to call out all the lies the Larger Fox Network spreads and more . It is not enough to ridicule them — we need to present a correct and accurate rebuttal to what they say . And more than that , we need news outlets to give us the space and time to get our viewpoints out there , even if it is not part of a major headline-grabbing news story . This is much more than a “ story ” ; racism and white supremacy are disgraceful and utterly destructive parts of our national history . We need to read about that history , and learn from it . The alternative looks very bloody .

GoDrone - A Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Firmware written in Go
Published : December 25 , 2013
Merry Christmas ( or Newtonmas if you prefer ) everybody .
Today I 'm very happy to release the first version of my favorite side project , GoDrone .
GoDrone is a free software alternative firmware for the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 . And yes , this hopefully makes it the first robotic visualizer for Go 's garbage collector : ) .
At this point the firmware is good enough to fly and provide basic attitude stabilization ( using a simple complementary filter + pid controllers ) , so I 'd really love to get feedback from any adventurous AR Drone owners . I 'm providing binary installers for OSX/Linux/Windows :
http : //www.godrone.io/en/latest/index.html
But you may also choose to install from source .
Depending on initial feedback , I 'd love to turn GoDrone into a viable alternative to the official firmware , and breathe some fresh air into the development of robotics software . In particular I 'd like to show that web technologies can rival native mobile/desktop apps in costs and UX for providing user interfaces to robots , and I 'd also like to promote the idea of using high level languages for firmware development in linux powered robots .

Image caption The US gave no details but reports say the arrest took place in Afghanistan
US forces have captured a senior Pakistan Taliban commander , Latif Mehsud , the state department has said .
The US gave no details of the operation , but Afghan officials said they were seized in eastern Afghanistan and taken to the Bagram base near Kabul .
They were reportedly returning from talks over a mooted prisoner-swap deal , and the capture is said to have angered Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
The US described Latif Mehsud as a `` terrorist leader '' .
State department spokesperson Marie Harf said they were a close confidante of the Pakistani Taliban leader , Hakimullah Mehsud .
The group has killed thousands in its conflict with the Pakistani government .
It has also been blamed for the attempted bombing of Times Square in New York in 2010 , as well as attacks on US diplomats in Pakistan and many Pakistani civilians .
The group `` had also vowed to attack the US homeland again , '' Ms Harf said .
Afghan officials were quoted as saying that Latif Mehsud , who is not related to Hakimullah , was taken in Afghanistan 's eastern Logar province last week .
The Pakistani Taliban said they were taken at a Pakistan-Afghan border crossing in Khost province .
Latif Mehsud was reportedly returning from a meeting with Afghan intelligence officers to discuss swapping prisoners .
US and Pakistani media reports said the Afghans were trying to recruit them as a go-between for peace talks .
A spokesperson for President Hamid Karzai , Aimal Faizi , told the Washington Post : `` The Americans forcibly removed them and took them to Bagram . ''
Mr Faizi said Latif Mehsud had only agreed to meet Afghan operatives after months of negotiations .
Some reports say Mr Karzai , who is currently holding talks with visiting US Secretary of State John Kerry , was furious about the US operation .
The talks , on a stalled security deal between the two countries , began on Friday , and were extended for a third round on Saturday because of `` issues we are finalising '' , a presidential spokesperson said .
The two sides are trying to reach a deal that would allow US troops to remain in Afghanistan after the 2014 Nato troop withdrawal .
PM 's pledge
Latif Mehsud is thought to have started as a driver for a militia leader , but rapidly rose through the ranks .
They had recently become the right-hand man of Hakimullah Mehsud , acting as a negotiator for them in talks with other militia leaders , Pakistani media reports said .
This week , Hakimullah Mehsud told the BBC they were open to `` serious talks '' with Pakistan 's government but said they had not yet been approached .
In a rare interview , Hakimullah Mehsud denied carrying out recent deadly attacks in public places but said they would continue to target `` America and its friends '' .

The chief loosely controls more than 30 militant groups in Pakistan 's tribal areas .
After being elected prime minister in May , Nawaz Sharif announced they would open unconditional talks with the Taliban .
The group controls areas in the north-west , and has been blamed for a wave of suicide bombings and other attacks .
Along with Pakistan , the Afghan government has also made overtures for peace with the Taliban . A number of Taliban prisoners have been freed to smooth the process .
US attempts in June to talk to the Taliban , including the opening of a now-shut Taliban office in Qatar , infuriated Mr Karzai .
Half of flu cases arise when people inhale tiny particles that float in the air , an international group of researchers reports June 4 in Nature Communications . The finding flies in the face of conventional wisdom , which holds that nearly all influenza spreads by large droplets that sick people release when they sneeze or cough . Those large droplets , the theory went , get on people 's hands and transmit the virus from there .
While scientists knew that small particles called aerosols represent possible routes of disease spread , they thought that cases almost never arise that way .
Public health officials say that knowing how often flu transmits via the air is important for controlling outbreaks , especially when dealing with pandemic strains for which no vaccine exists .
Benjamin Cowling , an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong , and their colleagues studied how flu spread among 782 families in Bangkok and Hong Kong during re
Microsoft 's decision to cut 18,000 jobs from its workforce represents the largest round of layoffs in the company 's history , but it also understates the impact on the company and the job market .
In addition to those core cuts , the company is aiming to significantly reduce its reliance on contingent workers — the thousands of vendors and contractors who work on Microsoft projects and products but are employed through third-party placement firms and consulting companies .
In Microsoft lingo , these are “ orange badges , ” as opposed the blue badges worn by people employed directly by the company . This is sometimes described as Microsoft 's “ shadow workforce , ” because the jobs are n't included in the official employment numbers provided by the company .
Microsoft is n't saying how many contingent jobs will be cut across the company , but we 've confirmed that the 18,000 number released by the company does n't include the expected additional cutbacks in vendors and contractors .
Mary Jo Foley of ZDNet cites an email from Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner to the company 's sales and marketing group , in which Turner says the plan inside that group is to “ reduce our reliance on contingent staff augmentation by over 20 percent year-over-year . ”
We 're hearing from people inside the company that Microsoft started changing its practices with some contingent contracts even in advance of this morning 's announcements — putting some workers on shorter-term contracts , allowing them to be reconsidered after the current quarter .
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella alluded to the impact on contingent staff in their email to employees , saying that the changes “ will affect both the Microsoft workforce and our vendor staff , ” without going into additional details . This is part of Nadella 's broader effort to streamline the company 's engineering and product development to be more responsive and bring products to market more quickly .

Rafters from Windy Hill Village apartment complex
The Ramblin ' Raft Race was an annual Memorial Day weekend raft race on the Chattahoochee River in Atlanta that lasted from 1969 to 1980 . At its peak , more than 300,000 rafters partook in the race . Amid increasing environmentalism , the race was cancelled . The race was associated with consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs , both by the rafters and the thousands of spectators that lined a route that began in Sandy Springs and ended in Vinings . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
History [ edit ]
Rafters along the river
A bird's-eye view of the race
The race began in 1969 when several Delta Sigma Phi fraternity members at Georgia Tech , organized it as a social event . When the radio station WQXI became a sponsor and promoter , the race began to draw a larger crowd . By the mid-1970s , hundreds of thousands of people were crowding the Chattahoochee to either watch or participate . The event began to draw national and even international attention , with the Guinness Book of World Records dubbing it the world 's largest participant sporting event , CBS News ' anchor Dan Rather reporting on it , and a French documentary on the river mentioning it . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
A multitude of reasons contributed to the race 's eventual cancellation . Property owners along the river complained of the public drunkenness , drug and alcohol use , and nudity , exhibited by both the participants and spectators . In 1978 , amid increasing environmental concerns in the country , President Jimmy Carter signed a bill creating the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area . By 1980 , the race 's last year , the National Park Service had to budget an extra $ 50,000 to bring extra in rangers , some from as far away as Washington , D.C. , to handle the large crowds that attended the event . In addition , local authorities began to crack down on the event 's participants by issuing citations for public drunkenness , and in 1980 , Fulton County towed an estimated 4,000 cars . The 1980 race also saw a drowning , the only one in the race 's decade-plus run . Thus , following the 1980 race , an overextended park service informed race organizers that if they wanted the event to continue , the sponsors would have to pay for security and cleanup . The sponsors refused , and the event was cancelled indefinitely . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Environmental affect [ edit ]
Studies by the Georgia Wildlife Foundation found that the raft race itself was n't actually harming the river to any significant degree , as the clean-up of litter was manageable . However , the race 's spectators posed the larger environmental threat , since they were trampling fragile vegetation along the banks of the river . [ 1 ] [ 3 ]

Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness again complained “ political policing ” when they addressed a rally in west Belfast this afternoon in support of Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams .
Mr Adams is being questioned at Antrim police station for the fourth successive day in connection with the investigation into the murder of Jean McConville in 1972 . They were arrested by appointment with the PSNI .
A several hundred people attended a demonstration on the Lower Falls Road which took place beside the new mural of Mr Adams , which described them as “ peacemaker , leader and visionary ” .
Many leading Sinn Féin politicians such as Gerry Kelly , Martina Anderson , Alex Maskey and Carál ni Chuilín joined the rally .
Many people held up posters of Mr Adams alongside Nelson Mandela stating “ Defend the peace process ” .
Mr McGuinness told the crowd that there was within the PSNI “ an embittered rump of the old RUC ” , which was anti Sinn Féin and anti Gerry Adams .
“ These people want to settle old scores whatever the political cost , ” they claimed .
“ We fully support the PSNI in the fair and democratic implementation of policing and justice but our support is a critical support . ”
Mr McGuinness said no police force was immune from criticism “ if it is acting in a politically biased and partisan fashion ” .
“ The arrest of Gerry Adams is evidence that there is an element within the PSNI who are against the peace process and hate Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin . They are , what the reformers within PSNI have described to us as the dark side . ”
Mr McGuinness described as nonsense accounts by the Northern Secretary Theresa Villiers that there was no political interference in police , and that no one was above the law .
Citing cases such as killing by British soldiers , of civilians , in Derry on Bloody Sunday and at Ballymurphy in west Belfast , they said no British soldier was brought to justice for these acts .
“ The indisputable fact is that for 40 years there has been a virtual amnesty for British state forces involved in killing citizens both directly and through state collusion with unionists death squads , ” said Mr McGuinness .
They said that republicans stood by Mr Adams who was “ a peacemaker , a leader , a visionary ” .
They added : “ There would be no peace process but for their commitment and dedication . Gerry Adams is committed to moving this process forward . They will not be deterred or deflected and neither will we . The dark side fear them and they fear us . ”
SDLP West Belfast MLA Alex Attwood criticised Sinn Féin for staging the rally and said people must stand in support of the McConville family .
They said some people were “ on the wrong side of where the great majority of people are ” .
“ It begs many , many questions that a rally was held this afternoon in the shadow of Divis , from the very place where Jean McConville was taken and then murdered , ” added Mr Attwood .
They continued , ” How can any organisation think it appropriate to convene a rally around the arrest of a person in relation to Jean McConville 's murder yards from where they were abducted ? ”
Mr Attwood said the rally was “ another example of Sinn Féin displaying fundamentally bad judgment , at the very least , around the recent arrest ” .
“ Martin McGuinness has raised questions about support for policing . The new beginning to policing was hard won and no one should casually undermine it .
“ The comments of Mr McGuinness are a challenge to Irish democracy , that somehow one person is bigger than peace or politics . As before , Sinn Féin are on the wrong side of the people of Ireland . ”
Microsoft , which was required to license the confidential interoperability codes for its server software to competitors after losing a 10-year European antitrust suit , is opposing a blanket endorsement of open-source software in the E.U . document , saying it would limit choice because it could discourage public-sector clients from buying proprietary software .
Microsoft , based in Redmond , Washington , still makes at least half of its revenue from its proprietary Windows operating system for computers and servers and from its Office desktop application suite , according to its most recent financial report .
“ Interoperability is a big issue . It is something that could potentially unseat the status quo , ” said Jan Duffy , a research director at International Data in London . “ It is fair to say that a majority of the countries in Europe are beginning to explore open-source alternatives in the public sector as they look to potential cost savings . ”
John Vassallo , a Microsoft vice president for E.U . legal and corporate affairs in Brussels , said Microsoft had taken significant steps after its European antitrust settlement to incorporate open-source products in its lineup . It has licensed thousands of pages of protocols for its server software , set up joint interoperability labs with two competitors , Sun and Novell , and started projects like Simple Cloud API , a joint effort with I.B.M . to develop common ways of storing documents and files in cloud computing .
“ We are clearly in favor of a mix and having the choice of any software , open or mixed , whatever suits governments , ” Mr. Vassallo said . “ It 's not putting a particular preference in front of the buyers that will solve the issue of working across borders . It is the opposite , having more choice — then more technical solutions and innovation will be available . ”
Google , I.B.M . and Oracle , which in January bought the open-source software pioneer Sun Microsystems , are the main supporters of Open Forum Europe , a group based in Brussels that has been lobbying for an explicit endorsement of open-source software . Graham Taylor , the Open Forum Europe chief executive , says more than 90 percent of European governments end up buying proprietary software products because of inertia , lack of knowledge about open-source alternatives or the fear of switching to a new supplier .
Lobbying by Microsoft and other European companies that make proprietary software , like Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent , has also been formidable , Mr. Taylor said . Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent sell proprietary software to governments to , among other things , help run their internal agency telecommunication systems . About 50 companies , groups and individuals submitted comments to the commission on both sides of the issue .

“ We are up against a very big , powerful lobby , ” Mr. Taylor said . “ The makers of proprietary software are protecting the standards that are already in existence . They are also , of course , trying to preserve their market positions . ”

In Europe , the birthplace of the Linux open-source operating system and MySQL open-source database software , which is now owned by Oracle , open-source activists have been increasingly challenging local government administrators when they decide to renew software licenses for the products of Microsoft and other proprietary vendors .
In Bolzano , a city in northern Italy , a Linux users group in May challenged the provincial government 's decision to spend €2.2 million , or $ 2.8 million , over three years to renew and upgrade software licenses for 161 Microsoft servers and 4,000 desktop computers used to run the day-to-day business of local government .
“ We are afraid the administration is getting trapped in this weird logic of software license updates and vendor lock-in , ” said Daniele Gobbetti , 31 , the president of the Linux Users Group in Bolzano .
The administration responded by inviting group members to discuss the issue in August , but so far it has not indicated that it is willing to reverse its decision .
Maros Sefcovic , the European commissioner for interinstitutional affairs and administration overseeing the purchasing recommendation , said the goal was to create an environment of interoperability that allows governments across the European Union to communicate effectively at low cost .
They said the recommendation was based on principles like “ openness , ” and the document “ promotes technological neutrality through the use of standards. ” But they declined to comment on how the draft proposal specifically addressed the question of open-source versus proprietary software .
The latest draft of the commission 's recommendation , which is circulating among the 27 commissioners , has not been publicly disclosed . But according to a person with knowledge of the document , who was not authorized to speak for the commission , the draft treats the question of open-source versus proprietary software in neutral terms , leaving purchasing decisions , as before , up to individual governments .
On June 10 , the European commissioner for the digital agenda , Neelie Kroes , conceded in a speech to a summit meeting organized by Open Forum Europe in Brussels that drafting the purchasing policy had “ not been easy . ”
In their previous job , as European competition commissioner , Mrs. Kroes concluded the commission 's 10-year antitrust case against Microsoft , requiring the company to pay €1.2 billion in fines and to license server protocols to competitors . In their speech , Mrs. Kroes spoke positively about a rule used in their native Netherlands that required governments to choose open-source software or justify buying proprietary products .

“ Such a rule , as the default , would shield public authorities from the dangers of long-term lock-in , ” Mrs. Kroes said at the time .

For years Steven Spielberg did n't embrace DVD and all of their classic films stayed on VHS only . Eventually , they had a change of heart . The same can be said for the DVD to Blu-ray conversion . Spielberg was originally tentative to allow their films onto the new high definition format but has since changed their mind . Jurassic Park is already out . Jaws is on the way , as is E.T . The Extra Terrestrial and , most likely , others are too . The most exciting release , though , may be the set of Indiana Jones films which will be released on Blu-ray September 18 .
A new trailer for the release has come online showing a bunch of fantastic behind the scenes footage , some of which was reportedly not on the DVD box set released several years back . Check out the trailer below .
Thanks to Bleeding Cool for the heads-up on the trailer , which they surmise will be playing at the LucasFilm booth at San Diego Comic-Con , next to the real-life snake filled Well Of Souls that 'll be on the floor .
They also point out this awesome fan edit which is exactly the same , except it shaves 8 seconds off . That 8 seconds ( out of 2 minutes and 38 seconds ) completely removes Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . That 's pretty pathetic that even the official trailer only gave the movie that much time .
Being a super Indiana Jones fan , there 's a good shot I 'll be picking this up when it comes out . Or at least wait for a really good sale around the holidays . I ca n't help but be a tad bit ticked off , though , when a new set is released for a classic film series like this and it has new behind the scenes features . Meaning , they already released a big box set and they either purposely held stuff back or did n't look hard enough the first time . It 's classic LucasFilm though . Will we ever get an actual ultimate box set of these or the Star Wars films ?
Did these trailers get you excited ?
Celiac disease ( CD ) was initially described in the first century A.D. by a Greek physician named Aretaeus of Cappadocia . But neither Aretaeus nor anyone else knew that CD is caused by an autoimmune reaction to gluten , a protein in wheat . That did n't become clear until 1950 -- several centuries later -- when Dr. Willem Dicke , a Dutch pediatrician , conclusively proved that gluten was the culprit . Dicke 's discovery saved millions of children and adults from the perils of untreated celiac disease , including malnutrition , stunted growth , cancer , severe neurological and psychiatric illness and even death .
Since then , the mainstream view of gluten intolerance has been relatively black or white : Either you have celiac disease , in which case even a small amount of gluten will send you running to the bathroom in three seconds flat , or you do n't , and you can chug down beer and bagels without fear . This `` all-or-nothing '' view has led to some doctors telling patients that suspect they 're sensitive to gluten but test negative for CD that they 're simply imagining an affliction that does n't exist .
It turns out those doctors are wrong .
The Many Shades of Gluten Intolerance
In order to explain why , I have to give you a quick lesson in the biochemistry of wheat and wheat digestion .
Wheat contains several different classes of proteins . Gliadins and glutenins are the two main components of the gluten fraction of the wheat seed . ( They 're essential for giving bread the ability to rise properly during baking . ) Within the gliadin class , there are four different epitopes ( i.e . types ) : alpha- , beta- , gamma- and omega-gliadin . Wheat also contains agglutinins ( proteins that bind to sugar ) and prodynorphins ( proteins involved with cellular communication ) . Once wheat is consumed , enzymes in the digestive tract called tissue transglutaminases ( tTG ) help to break down the wheat compound . In this process , additional proteins are formed , including deamidated gliadin and gliadorphins ( aka gluteomorphins ) .
Here 's the crucial thing to understand : Celiac disease is characterized by an immune response to a specific epitope of gliadin ( alpha-gliadin ) and a specific type of transglutaminase ( tTG-2 ) . But we now know that people can ( and do ) react to several other components of wheat and gluten -- including other epitopes of gliadin ( beta , gamma , omega ) , glutenin , WGA and deamidated gliadin -- as well as other types of transglutaminase , including type 3 ( primarily found in the skin ) and type 6 ( primarily found in the brain ) .
This is a huge problem because conventional lab testing for CD and of gluten intolerance only screens for antibodies to alpha-gliadin and transglutaminase-2 . If you 're reacting to any other fractions of the wheat protein ( e.g. , beta-gliadin , gamma-gliadin or omega-gliadin ) , or any other types of transglutaminase ( e.g. , type 3 or type 6 ) , you 'll test negative for CD and gluten intolerance no matter how severely you 're reacting to wheat .
Beyond Celiac : Why CD Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg
Official statistics suggest that Celiac disease affects between 0.7 percent and 1 percent of the U.S. population . But considering the limited scope of the testing , it 's possible that the actual incidence might be much higher .
In addition , CD is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to gluten intolerance . Celiac disease is caused by a distinct autoimmune response to wheat proteins and transglutaminase enzymes in the gut . But CD is just one possible expression of gluten intolerance ; there are many other ways that sensitivity to gluten can manifest in the body . These are collectively referred to as `` Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity , '' or NCGS .
There 's no consensus definition of NCGS yet , but the most common understanding is that it 's a reaction to gluten that is not autoimmune ( like CD ) or allergic ( like wheat allergy ) . Another definition I 've seen is , `` a reaction to gluten that resolves when gluten is removed from the diet and CD and allergy have been ruled out . ''
It 's difficult to estimate the prevalence of NCGS because there is no definitive diagnostic test for it . As I mentioned above , the currently available tests for gluten sensitivity are primitive and only screen for a small fraction of the components of wheat that people react to . Another issue is the variety of symptoms caused by CD and NCGS . While most people assume that gluten intolerance always causes digestive distress , this is not the case . Almost 50 percent of new patients diagnosed with CD do not have gastrointestinal symptoms . Moreover , for every one case of CD that is diagnosed , there are 6.4 cases that remain undiagnosed -- the majority of which are atypical or silent forms without gastrointestinal symptoms .
Gluten intolerance can affect nearly every tissue in the body , including the brain , skin , endocrine system , stomach , liver , blood vessels , smooth muscles and even the nucleus of cells . CD and NCGS are associated with an astonishing variety of diseases , from schizophrenia and epilepsy , to Type 1 diabetes and osteoporosis , to dermatitis and psoriasis , to Hashimoto 's hypothyroidism to peripheral neuropathy . Because the range of symptoms associated with gluten intolerance is so broad and nonspecific ( e.g. , can be attributed to any number of conditions ) , many patients and doctors do n't suspect gluten may be the cause .
Even with these limitations , some estimates suggest NCGS may occur in as many as 1 in 20 Americans . And while some mainstream medical professionals continue to insist that NCGS does n't exist , several studies have validated it as a distinct clinical condition -- including gold-standard , double-blind , placebo-controlled trials .
The Gluten-Free Challenge : Still the Best Test for Gluten Intolerance
With all of this in mind , the obvious question that arises is , `` What 's the best way to test for gluten intolerance ? '' Because of the limitations of current laboratory testing I described above , most experts on gluten sensitivity agree that the only reliable test is a `` gluten challenge . '' This involves removing gluten from the diet completely for a period of at least 30 days , and then adding it back in after that . If symptoms improve during the elimination period , and return when gluten is reintroduced , a diagnosis of NCGS can be made .
However , for many people a gluten-free diet is n't enough . Some grains that do n't contain gluten , such as corn , oats and rice , contain proteins that are similar enough in structure to gluten to elicit an immune response in people with CD or NCGS . In addition , about 50 percent of patients with CD show signs of intolerance to casein , the protein in milk . This may explain why up to 30 percent of CD patients continue to have symptoms or clinical signs after adopting a gluten-free diet . For this reason , I recommend a complete grain- and dairy-free diet during the gluten challenge period . ( A Paleo diet is an excellent choice . Visit my website to learn more . )
Finally , though the gluten challenge is still the gold standard test for gluten intolerance , there is a relatively new lab ( Cyrex Laboratories ) offering a comprehensive blood test which screens for all of the wheat and gluten proteins and transglutaminase enzymes I mentioned above . This can be a helpful diagnostic tool , but it should never replace a gluten/Paleo challenge . ( Note : It must be ordered by a physician or health care practitioner . )
Now I 'd like to hear from you . Do you suspect you may have gluten intolerance ? If so , has removing gluten resolved your symptoms -- or have you found it necessary to remove grains and dairy as well ? If you have n't tried a gluten challenge , what 's holding you back ?

This week 's biggest political controversies exposed fault lines within the country 's major political factions , with the right fighting about civil disobedience while the left fought over the attempted murder of a Republican Congressman .
Shakespeare in the Park
On Friday night , two conservatives disrupted a New York performance of Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar that escalates the left 's campaign of imagery designed to cathartically depict the death or murder of President Donald Trump . TheRebel.tv 's Laura Loomer was arrested for running onstage during the Shakespeare in the Park production , while activist Jack Posobiec taped their demonstration and shouted at the crowd : “ The blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands ! ”
“ Old Right ”
Several authors at anti-Trump conservative publications condemned Loomer and Posobiec , arguing that the two infringed on the free speech of Shakespeare in the Park and their tactics were too close to the Occupy of Black Lives Matter movement .
Pro-Trump conservatives labeled this faction the “ old right , ” stating that there is no moral equivalence between this disruption and the violence of left-wing protesters in dozens of recent incidents .
The old right losers who are upset about what Laura did do n't realize that unlike them , we fight – and that 's why our guy won . # FreeLaura — Cassandra Fairbanks ❤️⏳ ( @ CassandraRules ) June 17 , 2017

Use free speech in ways that irritate the left . Do not impede other people 's freedom of speech . This is not difficult . — Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) June 18 , 2017
At the same time , the left was infighting over a much more high-stakes topic : targeted political violence .
Steve Scalise
On Wednesday , a 66-year-old Illinois man opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game , wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and putting them in critical condition through the weekend . The attacker — James Hodgkinson , who was killed by police returning fire — also shot Two Capitol Police officers , a congressional staffer , and a lobbyist . The Daily Caller has reported that investigators found a list of GOP lawmakers ' names on Hodgkinson 's body .
Instead of universal condemnation , Hodgkinson 's attack has brought about a tone-policing feud between the establishment left and the social justice left .
Impulse Control
Over the weekend , several Verified progressives of varying prominence — an L.A. Times blogger , the creator of # OscarsSoWhite , a rapper with 250 YouTube subscribers , an Uproxx editor , and TV actor George Takei — argued that sympathy for Rep. Scalise should not outweigh their sinful acts as a lawmaker . In most cases , more traditional liberals scolded their more radical peers for generating bad optics .

Josh Barro , an editor at Business Insider , wrote a thread on how the dehumanization of the left 's political opponents is “ bad for society. ” Dozens of progressives rebuked Barro in the responses , calling them misguided , “ insincere , ” and “ white boy . ”

Scarborough vs. Reid
On Saturday , MSNBC host Joy Reid called the situation “ delicate ” because , while “ everybody is wishing the member of congress well and hoping that they recover ” from an apparent assassination attempt , Reid lamented that “ Scalise has a history that we 've all been forced to sort of ignore on race . ”
Joe Scarborough , one of Reid 's colleagues , appeared to attack this segment — without naming their target . CNN anchor Jake Tapper co-signed the condemnation .

Pelosi vs. Pelosi
Septuagenarian Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi 's conflicting reactions to the Scalise shooting provided the clearest example of progressive id vs. progressive super-ego .
On the day of the shooting , they said — in direct contradiction to virtually every other statement they have made about President Trump and Republicans — that they prayed for unity in the wake of the attack .
On days like today , there are no Democrats or Republicans , only Americans united in our thoughts for the wounded . https : //t.co/HcsiRCcFiP — Nancy Pelosi ( @ NancyPelosi ) June 14 , 2017
Yet the very next day , in a seemingly unscripted moment , they returned to their default position of partisan blame :
Somewhere in the 1990s , Republicans decided on the politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons and that is the provenance of it and is what has continued . Again , I feel as if we 're having a family moment that is very , very serious and we 're talking about things that we can say , the discussion—save the discussion for another day . When you have a president that says , “ I can shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and nobody would care , ” when you have people saying , “ beat them up and I 'll pay their legal fees , ” when you have all the assaults that are made on Hillary Clinton , for them to be so sanctimonious is something .
The New Political Landscape
Two parties — Republicans and Democrats — still essentially rule American politics , but their constituencies are becoming more tribal and divided , even against their electoral allies . Trump voters hate Republican lawmakers , such as Sens . John McCain and Ben Sasse , for publicly attacking the president and their agenda during and after the 2016 election . Democrats are still picking up the pieces from a contentious DNC leadership race , where establishment-friendly Obama ally Tom Perez narrowly defeated far-left Rep. Keith Ellison .
These same divisions play out in cultural institutions , such as the social justice warriors purging classical liberal professor Bret Weinstein from the Evergreen State College campus or Fox News ' internal fight over the future of its programming style .
The arguments taking place now are over what are appropriate means to victory over the other side : for the right , whether to be polite or ruthless — and for the left , whether to be ruthless or violent .
A failed UKIP General Election candidate has been fined for racially abusing a worker in a Tesco car park .
Sam Naz , 33 , called trolley collector Mohammed Watfa a “ f * * * * * * foreigner , during a row outside Tesco 's Leytonstone store in March 2015 .
The incident took place just two months before Naz , of Twickenham , finished fifth in their bid to unseat Richmond Park and North Kingston MP Zac Goldsmith .
During a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court this week , jurors heard Mr Watfa intervened in an argument between Naz and male customer in the car park .
The 48-year-old supermarket worker , who comes from a Muslim background , intervened in the incident after they saw the man raise a fist at Naz .
They claimed they had been attacked by the shopper , before turning on Mr Watfa , calling them a : “ f * * * * * * foreigner ” .
Naz , who is of Pakistani descent , had denied the charge of racially aggravated intentional harassment , claiming Mr Watfa had been the aggressor during the incident .
They also denied suggestions they had used any racial slurs towards Mr Watfa .
However , jurors found Naz guilty yesterday ( Thursday , September 22 ) , in a unanimous decision .
They were fined £1,500 for the incident and ordered to pay £3,500 in court costs .
PHIL Gould ca n't believe it .
The Penrith Panthers supremo said so five times in less than 90 seconds in the latest episode of their podcast Six Tackles with Gus .
Never one to keep quiet when an issue in rugby league is grinding their gears , Gould revealed how incensed they were at the $ 2100 fine the NRL slapped Sam Thaiday with after the Broncos ' round three clashes against the Melbourne Storm .
Thaiday was charged with contrary conduct for yanking on Storm prop Jesse Bromwich 's injured thumb last Friday night . Bromwich came into the game with the ailment and Thaiday knew it so they intentionally targeted the digit .
Initially Thaiday was told to cough up $ 1500 but they fought the charge and lost , adding an extra $ 600 to the fine . Gould was outraged .
“ I can not believe this , I honestly ca n't believe it , ” Gould said . “ All coaches now will have their players out there with some bandage on . You ca n't touch their hands , you ca n't touch their elbows .
“ They were mucking around . Honestly , I just do n't think it 's an issue , I really do n't .
“ Oh my god , I can not believe this was even ( an issue ) .
“ What if you 've got a knee guard ? What if you 've got an elbow guard ? What if you 've got a shoulder guard ? What if you know he 's got a cracked rib ?
“ What are we going to do ? Sam would have been mucking around with them ... and that 's up to Jesse to sort it out . I ca n't believe it . ”
Poor sportsmanship or part of the game ? Source : Twitter
Prior to the 2017 season kicking off the NRL announced it was introducing a fines system for low grade offences to reduce the likelihood of players getting suspended for minor offences following a build up of demerit points .
Gould welcomed this move but was fearful from the start it would see players hit in the hip pocket for the pettiest of indiscretions . Now their fear has been realised .
“ That 's what I feared at the start of the year when they said ( they were introducing a fines system ) , ” Gould said . “ Now we 've downgraded the minor incident to the ridiculous . We 'll fine you for whatever we think does n't look right or for whatever people complain about on social media .
“ I honestly ca n't believe it . I want someone to explain to me why that is so against the spirit of the game when that is the game . ”
‘ WE 'RE GOING TO BE JUMPING AT SHADOWS '
Thaiday got off lightly compared to what three NRL clubs had to fork out for breaching concussion protocol on the weekend .
The Gold Coast Titans ( $ 150,000 ) , St George Illawarra Dragons ( $ 100,000 ) and Newcastle Knights ( $ 150,000 ) were all hit with heavy fines for a failure to follow the strict rules around treating players with suspected concussion .
Josh Dugan appeared to cop a head knock in the Dragons ' win over Cronulla but was allowed to play on . The Knights were slugged for the same amount after Brendan Elliot stayed on after copping a swinging arm from Hymel Hunt while the Titans ' fine relates to their handling of incidents involving Kane Elgey , Joe Greenwood and Ryan Simpkins .
Gould said they understood player welfare was at the heart of the decision but wondered whether the game was going too far in forcing clubs to assess players for head knocks the minute they stayed down with any injury .
Dugan copped a heavy whack on the weekend . Source : AAP
“ People think it 's easy to determine whether a player is concussed or not , you know a player may be stunned or a player may be hurt but that does n't necessarily mean he 's concussed , ” Gould said .
“ Just because a player goes down injured does n't mean we should have to get them off to test them for concussion all the time . ”
The 59-year-old said the fines were a clear indication the NRL is on a mission to ensure no player 's wellbeing is compromised in the pursuit of competition points . They were worried the severity of the punishments will scare teams into being overly-cautious when it comes to assessing players .
“ We 're now seeing more and more head clashes , we 're seeing more players go off for a head injury assessment ( HIA ) ... it 's a difficult issue and if you 're going to throw fines on top of that well now we 're going to be jumping at shadows , ” they said .
“ As soon as a bloke rubs their head because they got a knock we 're going to say he 's got to come off and have a HIA .
“ This is the problem that we 've got ... it does n't mean they 've always got concussion .
“ We understand now no one 's going to allow that attitude to maintain and we 're going to keep running players off the field to the HIA , I do n't know where it 's going to end . ”
Mumbai : Banks will continue to accept currency notes with scribbling , the Reserve Bank said , dismissing rumours that it has stopped banks from accepting such notes from tomorrow .
`` In the wake of rumours circulating in the market that from January 1 , 2014 , banks will not accept banknotes with anything written on them , the RBI has urged members of public not to fall prey to such rumours and to use their banknotes without any fear , '' RBI said in a notification .
RBI said it has not issued any such instructions . However , it reiterated that writing or scribbling on banknotes works against its 'clean note policy ' and sought co-operation from public , institutions and others in keeping the banknotes clean by not writing anything on them .
Referring to its August instructions on 'clean note policy ' , the RBI said banks were advised to instruct their staff not to scribble or write on the body of the banknotes .
The instruction was issued as it was observed that the bank officials themselves were in the habit of writing on banknotes which went against the 'clean note policy ' .
RBI in August had said it has been noticed that at certain branches of banks , the practice of writing/scribbling on the body of the banknotes continues to remain in vogue .
Under the present system of mechanised processing of banknotes , RBI said , inscription or scribbling on any part of the banknote would render it to be classified as unfit for reissue .
Accordingly , such banknotes get treated as soiled banknotes and can not be recirculated .

When you think of human garbage , you think Devin Faraci . If you think that 's a little too strong , I can assure you , that it 's not . The owner of “ Badass ” Digest , is the type of guy who would harass 30+ year old virgins on National Suicide Awareness Day , and then laugh about it with their hipster douchebag buddies .
He 's the type of person who writes a piece at the beginning of GamerGate talking about humility , and how they used to be bullied , then engages in some of the most offensive behavior we 've seen from the haters .

In this way , he 's like many other haters of our movement . They all write moderate columns , so that they 'll have something to feed to the mainstream idiots . On Twitter , they show you their real character . It is n't pretty , as we 've seen . The SJW mindset is that the lying , cheating , and censoring is justified by their noble end goals . They think of themselves as better than us mere mortals , and wish to impose their vision through oppression , rather than winning the debate .
But , at least I think someone like Anita Sarkeesian actually knows feminism . Simpleminded followers like Faraci do n't actually realize what it is they 're supporting ( not that they would necessarily care , because SJW support benefits them ) . When I confronted them on Twitter with a picture of Andrea Dworkin , they had no idea who they are , and tried to say I was fat shaming ( lol ) . Well , they were an extremist feminist thinker , whose work forms the basis for a lot of what Anita and Jonathan McIntosh ( the man behind the curtain ) try to push now . They 're sex-negative , and want to inflict that view onto our pastime .

The useful idiots like Devin Faraci have no idea what it is their actually supporting . They simply want to be part of the hipster crowd . Faraci said it himself , they were a nerd in high school . They would be treated like a nerd now , without their SJW social stance , and website . He 's finally gotten to be part of that in crowd that they always dreamed of being a part of . He 's just had to cancel out all intellectual curiosity to do it .
Like Tyler Malka , they do n't believe a word of what he 's saying ( other than the malicious insults , and deadly serious harassment of seriously depressed individuals ) . He 's a menace to all respectable people , but they do serve a purpose . Faraci 's a great example of SJW hypocrisy , just like Leigh Alexander , and the asupervisorstioned Tyler Malka . Their mere existence shows their words to be hollow . How they can allow these people to retain power and influence , and then lecture us about not hunting down some random trolls , is beyond me .
SHARE AREA :
When searching for the meaning and feeling of love , David always was an over thinker .
They played so many non existent scenarios in their head . Often alone they wondered why no one would love him . On an endless search , they would pour their heart out only to get rejected .
They would buy women 's time and attention , they would go out of their way to be noticed and accepted . David an introvert , very soft spoken , and was often neglected .
They were the kind of guy , that if you said you liked something , they would make sure you got it even if that meant risking their lives , you were going to have exactly what you asked for . Only if it was up to David . They were also that kind of guy that held everything in . Their story was their story and they would tell you a façade to disguise their true feelings .
A very generous man , with a kind attitude , described by many as a heart of Gold .
So many times though , it is the person you hear people talk about , that has a heart of gold , is the very same person who does n't even know their own value and understand their worth . David was that way . They did n't know their own value . They wore their heart on their sleeve . The love they yearned for from their mother was non existent to them because they had another child who commanded more of their attention . Their father , would only come around only when they needed something . They had girlfriends but those girlfriends did n't really love them for him . They loved the idea of them , but there was no compatibility . They did n't have many friends either . They were an introvert preferring to keep their circle close knit .
A lost because David would ask . “ Why is it so hard to be loved ? ” They would look to the sky with tears coming down their eyes form time to time , venting “ Why does no on love me ? , I just want to be accepted , I want someone to love me for me ! , to appreciate me for me . How hard is it ? , Why me ? , is anyone listening ? ”
They felt as if this was maybe the way of God punishing them from a past life , or punishing them for their ways as a child , or other various forms of karma . What they were unaware of though is God does n't punish anyone . God is love . We punish ourselves .
One day they were sitting outside , just contemplating their life . Eyes closed as they would listen to the waves of the bay water crashing along the bank , and the sounds of the birds , Pelicans to be specific . David always enjoyed watching and listening to the pelicans teaching their young to fish . They always viewed it as a lesson because after the Adult pelican would crash it 's way into the water , the baby would be hesitant at first , then eventually crashing into the water . They felt it was a way of teaching the new born to trust it 's surrounding , be cautious at first but when you know your surroundings and there is something you want , to go for it . Make that splash . If you just observe nature you will be taught valuable lessons . For David the pelican watching was so relaxing , it would often help them doze off .
As they were sitting They felt a hand touch them on the shoulder .
“ Do you mind if I join you ? ” A tall man , with a deep voice asked .
“ No not at all . ”
This gentleman joined them and as they did , they stared at the water . “ It is a beautiful day is n't ? ”
Eyes still closed , David replied “ It sure is. ” I just wish I was spending this moment with a woman I can love. ” But I can settle for you as a consolation ” jokingly and the man laughed .
Then said “ Son , if you loved yourself , you would n't have to worry about that , People tend to think that they need someone to love , to experience love . Just love the moment and be . ”
David quickly replied with I do n't even know how to just love the moment and be , I am searching for love , I do n't know what love really means . I just have an idea of what it is and means and I want to find it for myself . ”
The gentleman replied with a smirk . “ That is the problem I noticed today . So many people have this idea of love , this created illusion of a four-letter word . But not a lot of people take the time to understand it . Not a lot of people have the patience to really search for it . I believe God put us all on an individual treasure hunt . Sometimes you just have to follow the signs , quiet your mind and listen . God always talks son , and when God talks , God guides , and when God guides , just follow their light because their light is always shining on the ultimate prize . ”
When David opened their eyes , and looked next to him , that gentleman was gone , there was no one there , just an empty space on the bench as they overlooked the water and the parenting pelicans .
David , had only one thought on their mind , a treasure hunt . What did , whatever they experience mean .
“ I believe God put us all on an individual treasure hunt ” , the sounds of what they heard , that echoed in their head . It was getting late , so they decided to walk home . All they were thinking about was words , of what they were hearing . As they were walking they stumbled up on a carving on the sidewalk that said Think God Big . Instantly thought that was a sign . “ Hmm ” , they thought . They continued walking , curious and overthinking . Wondering why they experienced what they experienced . They did not know they were closer to their answer now more than ever . They got home and went straight to their bible . During their walk they said they were just going to open their bible and read a random passage as a sign . Before they actually opened their bible . They closed their eyes and meditated , just sulking in the silence and they heard a whisper . “ I Am , Inside ” . It was a chant from the unknown . They got to their bible and opened it up and it was Isaiah 45:3 –
And I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou mayest know that I , the LORD , which call thee by thy name , am the God of Israel . They closed the bible , opened it again , and it was Luke 12:34 – For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . Once again they closed it and opened it only to read Colossians 2:3 – In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge . Thinking to themselves this is a sign . ‘ Just like the man said God always talks son , and when God talks , God guides , and when God guides , just follow their light because their light is always shining on the ultimate prize . ”
Before they went to bed , they prayed and then meditated on this day of confusion , thought , and some type of enlightenment . Before they passed out they muttered a simple phrase , as if it was given to them by the heavens .
“ The ultimate treasure hunt is the search for love that is hidden within us . ”
As they passed out the Gentleman appeared in their dreams , this time they were face to face with him , the voice they were hearing was the voice of himself . The man said to him , “ I am , you from within . You never really searched for me , you always searched outside of me . You never really took time to get to know me , you never got to understand your own ways , or who you even are . But before you passed out with one phrase you ended your elusive search for love . By saying ” The ultimate treasure hunt is the search for love that is hidden within us . ”
“ True love is treasure buried deep within ourselves. ” You just needed to quiet your outside world and make time for us to become connected and have patience in my teaching. ” I know you best because I am you , I am the God within you , and I love you , as long as you have me , self love , that is all you need in this world . Space will be created for everything else to occupy just have faith , in my way . ”
After David discovered self love , their whole world changed . Patiently and with time but in changed their whole life . They stopped overthinking and started learning , they forgave everyone is their past and lived with gratitude towards life and expressed gratitude towards others . Understanding that gratitude is the rawest expression of love and when you live with self love you become a more loving person .
David like so many of us is in a search for love , this for letter word that society has added so many meanings , different interpretations , and ideas , it has really distracted us from the inner search and being that is love . So it is like we are on this wild treasure hunt , that can sometime takes us to so many different places . But the real meaning of love is buried deep within us and once we discover it and live with self love everything in our life will be aligned on purpose for a greater purpose , and it will all make sense .

Chicago 's mild winter reaches another milestone on Tuesday : 319 days without an inch of snow falling .
That ties the record set in 1940 . Wednesday will break the record and , with temperatures forecast to surge into the 50s Friday and Saturday , the record streak will continue .
While Chicago has seen 1.3 inches of snow through Jan. 6 this winter , it has yet to see a calendar day with at least an inch of snow falling .
On average , the lowest temperature logged in a Chicago winter is 9 degrees below zero , and only 13 winters of the past 142 have failed to log at least one sub-zero reading . To date , this season 's lowest reading has been 10 degrees ( above zero ) .
A shift to temperatures more typical of January , possibly accompanied by snow , is forecast for late Saturday and Sunday .
Until then , expect considerably higher temperatures and much-needed rain .

IMPERIAL College scientists have suggested why the human genome may have fewer genes than rice .
Research published in the July issue of Trends in Immunology , shows how a more advanced immune system in humans could explain why the human genome may have only a slightly greater number of genes than the plant Arabidopsis thaliana , and probably less than rice , Oryza sativa .
The human genome is estimated to have as few as 30-45,000 functional genes , while Oryza sativa has between 32,000 and 56,000 functional genes . The earthworm , Caenorhabditis elegans , has 19,000 genes and the plant , Arabidopsis thaliana has 25,000 genes .
Dr Andrew George , reader in molecular immunology at the Hammersmith campus explained : Although humans are normally thought to be considerably more complex than organisms , such as plants , rice , yeast and earthworms , this is not reflected in their number of genes - humans have less than other supposedly less complex organisms .
The limited number of functional genes in the human genome may be a result of the presence of a more advanced immune system designed to protect us from disease , the doctor pointed out . It is important that the cells of the immune system do not recognise our own tissues or cells , as this would lead autoimmune disease , they stressed .
The limited size of the human genome could make further evolution for humans difficult . Fortunately , the human genome has been able to create genes which have multiple uses , thus making the best use of a limited number of genes , the doctor concluded .
Eating more fruits and vegetables is a generally good idea , but this alone is n't likely to help you lose weight , a new review of studies suggests .
Researchers analyzed previous research on weight loss and increased fruit and vegetable intake , which included data on more than 1,200 people . The investigators found that eating more fruit and vegetables , without also changing the amount of calories from other food sources , did not cause people to either lose or gain weight .
`` Across the board , all studies we reviewed showed a near-zero effect on weight loss , '' study author Kathryn Kaiser , an instructor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health , said in a statement .
Fruits and vegetables do have calories , and people who want to lose weight should reduce their overall energy intake , the researchers said .
`` Fruits and vegetables have many benefits , and we encourage people to include them in their diets , '' study author David Allison , associate dean for science in the UAB School of Public Health , told Live Science . `` Eat all the vegetables and fruit you want , but you have to cut out more calories from other foods , '' to lose weight , they said . [ 6 Easy Ways to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables ]
Public health authorities often fail to include the latter part of the message about the need to reduce the number of calories consumed , while recommending that people increase their intake of fruits and vegetables , Allen said .
However , the study did not show that the consumption of extra fruit and vegetables caused a weight gain .
`` It appears that an increase in servings does not increase weight , which is a good thing for getting more vitamins and fiber in one 's diet , '' Kaiser said .
Laura Jeffers , a registered dietician at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved with the study , said , `` This is a good summary of research that has been done . ''
Indeed , some of their clients are trying to lose weight and are adding fruits and vegetables to their diets without reducing their calorie intake , they said . If patients realized that this is not likely to work , they would be more successful in reaching their weight-loss goals , they said .
Fruits and vegetables include fiber and macronutrients that are important for health , they said . However , dieters should remember not to overeat , and they also may want to consider decreasing their overall food portions , they said .
The study was published Wednesday ( June 25 ) in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . Allen has received money from Kraft Foods and the Kellogg Co. ; Kaiser has received money from Coca-Cola Iberia . Another co-author , Richard D. Mattes , and the University of Alabama at Birmingham itself , have received funding from food companies .

The emergence of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) as a viable presidential nominee for the Democratic Party has sparked some deja vu for those who came of political awareness during the George W. Bush era .
Vermonters of a seemingly liberal bend , with grassroots armies of supporters and a robust Internet fundraising apparatus , seem to have a way of capturing the Democratic Party 's heart . Sanders and former Gov . Howard Dean are dissimilar in many respects , and that 's before even mentioning that Dean supports Sanders ' opponent , Hillary Clinton , in this campaign . But their trajectories have parallels , from the unexpected rise to the ( in Sanders ' case , burgeoning ) push back from party elites .
Sanders has n't caused nearly the same amount of panic that Dean did among establishment Democrats in 2003-2004 . That could simply be because the expectation is that Sanders ' campaign will ultimately collapse like Dean 's did in the weeks before the Iowa caucus .
But if you talk to folks working on behalf of the senator , they do n't see themselves at risk of Dean-like pitfalls . They 're not even studying their playbook for clues .
“ We have n't really used their campaign as a model or looked to it for lessons , ” Sanders ' top strategist , Tad Devine , told the Huffington Post not too long ago . “ I 'm not sure if Bernie talked to them about this but I doubt it . It 's just so different now than it was in 2004 . ”
From a structural level , Devine is right . Sanders ' fundraising apparatus is more robust than Dean 's , in part because the nature of the Internet now allows easier access and certainty when it comes to recruiting online donors . The issues dominating the process are also fundamentally different from 2004 and , arguably , more suited to Sanders ' strengths -- more focus on economic policy than the prosecution of the Iraq War .
But Dean , in their recent interview with `` Candidate Confessional , '' hinted at something that could still trip Sanders up the way it did him . At some point , Dean explained , they had to show voters that they could , in fact , be a president and not just an insurrectionist . But they could n't do it ; they were too habituated to their role as an outsider .
“ I was giving them something they deeply valued , which was hope . And to pull back and become the establishment figure that I knew I had to become president was really hard to do , ” Dean said . “ I knew I had to make the turn . And I could n't do it . I just could n't do it . ”
Dean ended up finishing third in Iowa and lost the New Hampshire primary to John Kerry shortly thereafter . Their stumbles were largely their own making . But it 's certainly true that the party establishment helped facilitate the fall , with outside groups running ads and spreading rumors against him , and lawmakers warning of a perilous down-ballot calamity were they to end up atop the ticket .
Echoes of that have begun popping up in 2016 with Sanders . The senator received a round of fairly critical commentary from traditionally liberal writers after the debate on Sunday , focused both on their policy proposals and the messaging he 's deployed on the trail .
Whether voters take those cues and sour on them as they did Dean is the fundamental question in the weeks ahead . Devine , who worked for Kerry in 2004 , seemed confident that there would n't be a similar trip up in the closing weeks .
“ Howard was popular with hardcore [ Democrats ] , and Bernie is very strong with more independent [ Democrats ] , the way Kerry was , ” they said . “ Bernie 's challenge is not to make the turn in their message , but to make sure more people hear their message … and to ensure that voters view them as credible as a potential nominee and president . Dean had to deal with the reality that 9/11 was still the driving force in American politics in '04 , and they did not offer enough reassurance on that front and it cost him . ”
John Wolff , an atheist in Manheim Township , Pennsylvania , has filed a complaint against Prudhomme 's Lost Cajun Kitchen for offering a 10 percent discount to diners who bring in a church bulletin on Sunday ( video below ) .
Wolff told the Intelligencer Journal that they filed the complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission because the restaurant discriminated against them for not attending church services .
Wolff said : “ I did this not out of spite , but out of a feeling against the prevailing self-righteousness that stems from religion , particularly in Lancaster County . It 's not a big deal in itself and I have no animosity toward Prudhomme 's , but I do bear a grudge against the religious right that seems to intrude on our civil rights , right and left , getting laws passed that favor religion . And this was one more nail and I wanted to do something about it . ”

Restaurant co-owner Sharon Prudhomme said that they planned to ignore the complaint : “ I did check with all churches that I know of and ministers and they have said anyone can grab and go . ''
`` Come on in grab a bulletin , you do n't have to stay at church , you can take it in and still have a nice dining discount . So , everybody 's covered ... this is America , I 'm an American , I have a business and I can advertise when and where I like to . ''

The Freedom from Religion Foundation , which is helping Wolff with their complaint , claims that discounts based on religion are illegal under the federal Civil Rights Act : “ As a place of ‘ public accommodation , ' it is illegal for restaurants , grocery stores or other businesses to discriminate , or show favoritism , on the basis of religion .

U.S. adults suffer a high burden from disease for which vaccines are recommended , and vaccination coverage is low . For example , data from the 2011 National Health Interview Survey showed that only 12.5 % of people aged 19 to 64 years got the Tdap ( tetanus–diphtheria–acellular pertussis ) vaccine , while only 29.5 % of women aged 19 to 26 years received the HPV ( human papillomavirus ) vaccine .
On Monday during APhA2013 , Erin Kennedy , DVM , MPH , Medical Officer at the CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases shared data on burden of vaccine-preventable disease and immunization coverage rates and noted that pharmacists are instrumental in driving CDC programs geared to improving vaccine uptake .
Fewer public health resources exist for adult immunization . Kennedy reported that from December 2010 to December 2011 , pediatric purchases on federal contracts totaled $ 3,535 billion ( including Vaccines for Children and Section 317 Immunization Program funds ) , whereas adult vaccine purchases totaled $ 44 million ( 317 Program funds only ) . Other barriers include competing social and economic demands among adults ; competing demands for providers ' time , with vaccines often not integrated into adult medical care practice ; the complexity of the adult vaccine schedule ; and limited patient awareness and demand for adult vaccinations .
Many opportunities exist for raising awareness of adult immunizations and increase provider recommendations for adult vaccination . One such opportunity is PPHF ( Prevention and Public Health Fund ) Area 5 : Plan and Implement Adult Immunization Programs . Made possible by the Affordable Care Act , PPHF Area 5 seeks to collaborate with employers to improve immunization among employees and work with pharmacies to improve immunization among adult patients . It will be operationalized through activities such as expanding adult immunization at community health centers , improving vaccine rates for health care workers , and increasing influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations at hospital discharge . Outcome measures for awardees of collaborative agreements will include the proportion and number of pharmacists trained to administer adult vaccines , proportion and number of pharmacists trained in using the state immunization information system , and the number of vaccine doses administered by pharmacists entered into the registry .
CDC 's request of pharmacists is to ensure that patients visiting pharmacies or clinics are aware of recommended vaccinations , assess patients ' vaccine needs , and , if possible , offer them needed vaccines . An example noted by Kennedy is for pharmacists to inform pregnant women that they should receive the Tdap vaccine after week 20 of pregnancy and the influenza vaccine anytime during pregnancy .
Pharmacists are in a great position to improve vaccination in people with high-risk conditions , such as diabetes , asthma , and cardiovascular disease . “ You know what prescriptions they are getting and what their health conditions are , so you have a great opportunity to improve immunization rates among these higher-risk individuals , ” said Kennedy .
CDC offers a wealth of resources for educating adult patients about vaccines . These include posters , tear sheets , and a recommended vaccines prescription pad .
“ We at CDC believe that pharmacies should be integrated as key community partners in vaccination efforts and emergency response , ” said Kennedy .
Renault still needs to increase its power output but knows how it will do so , according to engine technical director Remi Taffin .
After a disappointing 2015 season , Renault made progress with its power unit over the winter and provided a further step forward at the Monaco Grand Prix which saw Daniel Ricciardo take pole position for Red Bull . While the works team continues to struggle , Red Bull has been able to challenge Mercedes on occasion but Taffin is not yet satisfied .
`` It 's obviously encouraging to see that the power unit is now capable of fighting on track at the front and going for pole positions , '' Taffin said . `` It shows the work we have done has paid off but we know we still need to increase the power output and this is where our focus lies as we know how to achieve that . ''
And Taffin says the current specification of power unit is yielding smaller gains at each race after Renault has worked to optimise it over the last four rounds .
`` We have now got to the point where we are working on the smaller issues to improve the wider picture and give extra performance through driveability or additional power .
`` Having a reliable and generally driveable PU was one of our major targets this year and now that has been achieved we can work on the bigger picture , together with Enstone . We 're learning as a team all the time about operating car and every lesson learnt helps for the future . ''
And Taffin is unsure if the Hungaroring will suit the Renault team this weekend , even if the power unit is performing well .
`` We know that slower tracks with lots of tight corners are n't where our strengths lie . In general the car did n't perform well over the kerbs and in the slower turns , but with the extensive work we achieved at Silverstone , Budapest should benefit from new parts and a better understanding of the car .
`` On top of that , Budapest also has short straights between the corners so this could turn into our direction . We hence look forward to Budapest to maximise what we have got . ''

LONDON July 3 ( Thomson Reuters Foundation ) - As Germany and Spain sweated and London sweltered through its hottest July day on record this week , scientists said it is “ virtually certain ” that climate change is increasing the likelihood of such heat waves in Europe .
In real-time data analysis released on Friday , a team of international climate scientists from universities , meteorological services and research organisations said the kind of heat waves hitting Europe this week - defined as three-day periods of excessive heat - are becoming much more frequent in the region .
In De Bilt in the Netherlands , for example , a heat wave like the one forecast for the next few days would have been a roughly 1-in-30-years event in the 1900s , according to the scientists . It is now likely to happen every three and a half years , they said .
In Mannheim , Germany , a heat wave like that of the last few days would have been a once-in-a-century event in the 1900s , but is now likely to happen about every 15 years , they said .
London also saw its hottest recorded July day on Wednesday , with temperatures at Heathrow Airport hitting 36.7 Celsius , the scientists noted .
As heat waves grow more frequent , “ it does resonate with a much wider audience that this is connected to climate change and we 're facing a new normal ” , said Maarten van Aalst , director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre .
The heat wave analysis , which looked at five European cities , is part of a World Weather Attribution programme led by Climate Central , a U.S.-based science journalism organisation , and supported by scientists from organisations around the world , including Oxford University , the University of Melbourne , the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and van Aalst 's Climate Centre .
The programme aims to use climate and weather data , forecasting and climate models to show how changing weather patterns are linked to climate change .
It hopes to help cities and countries better understand and prepare for more extreme weather like this week 's scorching days in Europe .
‘ CALL YOUR GRANDMOTHER '
The Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics has predicted that on average 200 more people will die in that country each week during a heat wave , a 10 percent rise in deaths .
Deaths among the isolated elderly are a particular problem , and accounted for a big share of the estimated 70,000 additional people who died in France and other European nations during a 2003 heat wave .
At that time , “ people were really caught unawares by the combination of rising risk and changing structure of society ” , van Aalst said .
Traditionally , extended families have looked after the elderly in places like France , they said . But social changes now mean many more older people live alone in cities , with no one to ensure they do basic things like drink enough water in the heat .
Cities facing heat waves are having to adjust the way they deal with the threat , including through simple measures such as sending out social media messages urging people to “ give a call to your grandmother ” , van Aalst said .
In the Netherlands , television weather presenters now remind viewers when the country 's “ heat wave plan ” - put together after a 2006 heat wave there - has been activated , and give them tips on how to stay cool , they said .
Across Europe , “ there 's been a massive investment in such plans ” , they said , alongside a range of efforts to deal with more frequent heat waves , such as adding green spaces in cities .

OAKLAND ( KPIX ) — Raider Nation is not going down without a fight . The team may go to Vegas , but fans say the Raiders ' name should stay in Oakland .
Monday they announced a coalition of fans is joining forces with city leaders and businesses to keep NFL football in Oakland
“ We are breaking out silence today and exploring options to keep football in Oakland , ” says Ray Bobbitt of the Legal Action Committee . ”
They 've even enlisted high-profile New York sports attorney James Quinn to take on the crusade despite plans already in the works to build a $ 1.9 billion stadium in Las Vegas by 2020 .
“ I assure you that we 're going to take a long hard look and do everything that we can to ensure that , in fact , we continue to have NFL football — Raider NFL football , ” said Quinn addressing a crowd on the steps of Oakland City Hall .
Even if the team leaves Raiders fans say they are looking info legal options to keep the Raiders name and colors in Oakland .
The move is not without a precedent .
During the 1995 NFL season , legal action by the city of Cleveland and Cleveland Browns ticket holders led to a compromise when the team left to Baltimore to become the Ravens .
Cleveland kept the team name and colors , and a new team was reactivated in 1998 .
Fast-forward to 2017 . Raiders fans are n't ready to say ‘ game over ' when it comes to keeping the NFL in Oakland .
A new documentary from the Arab world focuses on Muslim and Jewish musicians who reunite thanks to their common passion , after being torn apart by war 50 years ago.The film `` El Gusto , '' showcases the group performing together in concert after the half-century of separation.The men play Chaabi , a traditional Algerian music they learned as young students at the Music Conservatory of Algiers in the 1940s.For decades , the Muslim and Jewish friends played music together and lived side by side in the hilly neighborhoods of the Casbah. “ Whether you were Jewish , Christian or Muslim , it did n't matter , ” says filmmaker Safinez Bousbia . “ These men that used to hang around in all these underground bars and drinking and jamming all night , with Africans , with Western Africans , with Corsican people , with Maltese . It was just a boiling point of meeting all sorts of people. ” Bousbia , who was born in Algiers but grew up in Europe , had n't heard much about the music which originated in the land of their ancestors . But she 's learned quite a bit about it over the past decade.Chaabi music comes from the word `` Chaab '' , meaning `` people , '' according to Bousbia. “ Chaabi music is a bit like jazz , ” they say . “ It actually originates from different influences where there 's Andalusian , there is Flamenco , Spanish , there is a lot of African beats and there is Oriental tunes and melodies . It 's mixing all these styles together with a lot of improvisation. ” In the mid-1950s , three decades before Bousbia was born , the Algerian War of Independence forced the group of Chaabi musicians to disperse.The Jewish members fled to France , while the others scattered throughout Algeria . The men did n't see each other again for more than 50 years.In 2003 , during a trip to Algiers , Bousbia met one of the group 's original members in their mirror shop . Along with their old photographs , Mohamed Ferkioui shared their story about the fellow musicians he 'd become separated from. “ I just was so touched by this man 's passion and story , ” they say , “ that I wanted to help them find their friends. ” It took them more than two years to find their long-lost friends , mainly by searching through the conservatory 's registration records . Soon after , they started organizing a reunion concert for the group , now called El Gusto , in Marseilles , France.Going through the ardous and emotional process of reuniting the men gave them the idea for a documentary.Since they had no experience as a filmmaker , the young architect sold their home and jewelry to finance the project . The entire adventure , from start to finish , took nine years.Bousbia says it was all worthwhile. “ For me , it was the attachment of the men . I was fascinated by these men that were just full of passion , ” they say , especially given their age . “ The youngest was 72 , the oldest was 96 or 97 . `` Despite the challenges of age and distance , the musicians travelled from Algeria and all parts of France to reconnect with their old friends in celebration of their shared passion.Life was very difficult for these men , says the filmmaker , “ and that 's why it was important for me to show it through the film , and for people to understand what these people went through. ” “ What was fascinating about these men , ” they add , “ is no matter what ordeal they went through , they were n't bitter about it . It was a page of history they did n't choose. ” While El Gusto might have started as their dream , they say , at some point , it became theirs as well. “ I saw these men change and open up and for me it was important to understand. ” '' El Gusto , '' the documentary , was recently presented at the Arabian Sights Film festival in Washington DC . The sold-out crowd gave Bousbia a standing ovation. “ Chaabi is something really unique to the city of Algiers , to the Casbah , ” said Abdallah Baali , Algeria 's ambassador to the U.S. , who attended the film 's opening . “ And this music , which is intended to really please a category of Algerians in Algiers , has become the music of everybody. ” As for the El Gusto orchestra , the men are currently on a sold-out European tour and recently produced their third album . A U.S. concert is planned for the near future.Bousbia says they hope El Gusto will remain as a Chaabi orchestra and that their film , and the music of these passionate men , will inspire future generations to continue the Chaabi tradition .
The Backstreet Boys are officially heading to Las Vegas to show they 've still got it goin ' on .
The group will present its Larger Than Life residency at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino . It will consist of 18 dates , scheduled for March 1 , 2017 to July 1 , 2017 .
`` It 's going to be an amazing , energetic , fun party show , '' band member Kevin Richardson said in a video announcing their effort .
Tickets go on sale Oct. 1 , with some pre-sales happening as early as Sept. 26 .
The band 's residency had been rumored since April .
The Backstreet Boys ' announcement makes them the latest musical act to spin nostalgic appeal into a lucrative arrangement .
Britney Spears started their residency in December 2013 with a 96-show deal that carried a $ 30 million price tag , according to The Hollywood Reporter . They later extended their stay for two more years , a move motivated by sell-out concerts and positive reviews .
Spears ' residency came a few months after Boyz II Men began their own stay at The Mirage , where they will be through 2018 .
Jennifer Lopez began their own residency at Planet Hollywood in January 2016 and extended their stay just seven months later , adding 21 shows .
Mariah Carey , meanwhile , announced earlier this week their two-year stint at The Colosseum in Caesar 's Palace will come to an end in May 2017 .
The city once almost exclusively known for booking easy-listening and legacy acts -- think Frank Sinatra and Wayne Newton -- for extended stays is now bringing in performers that appeal to millennial visitors , with musicians made popular in the '90s playing just a small part of that .
Jason Gastwirth , senior vice president of marketing and entertainment at Caesars Entertainment , said Planet Hollywood 's efforts are all part of a `` new era of entertainment '' -- one that 's for everyone .
`` Introducing the Backstreet Boys into our lineup is another highlight of the company consistently being at the forefront of entertainment and has set a high standard for Las Vegas , one that has forced others in the industry to follow , '' they told CNN in an email . `` It is clear that these remarkable names are attractive to millennials , but really these residencies are for anyone who is excited by pop culture and what 's relevant today . ''
Las Vegas visitors born between 1981 and 1994 accounted for 22 percent of all tourists in 2015 , according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority . Gen Xers ( born between 1965-80 ) made up 37 percent of visitors .
The average age of Vegas visitors dipped from 49 in 2011 to 47.7 in 2015 , according to stats from LVCVA .
Las Vegas has been attempting to build itself into a music destination on par with New York or Nashville , the Wall Street Journal noted in an article in June . High-profile residencies are key to that goal .
They also benefit the artists , who can put down roots and oftentimes take the opportunity to do more elaborate set-ups than what would be possible in a touring show .
`` If you 've ever been to a Backstreet Boys show , '' Backstreet Boy Brian Littrell added in their video , `` it 's going to be that on steroids . ''
If , you know , you want it that way .
“ Posters are delicate things , ” writes Aaron Draplin . So what is a poster-maker to do when misprinted , damaged , and test prints begin to pile up in the workshop ? For Draplin , the creator of Field Notes , the answer could n't have been too difficult : use these ‘ dead prints ' to make pocket-sized memo books .
So , in October of 2015 , limited edition “ Dead Print Field Notes ” were made for three poster-producing companies : Draplin Design Co. , Mondo , and Landland . Between all three companies , only 3,000 3-packs were made , and with images of these notebooks sporadically popping up on Instagram and Twitter , these Dead Print Field Notes became somewhat of a craze .
Although the notebooks contain basic 50 # blank paper , the unique covers , made from assorted posters , spurred on the collectors . Getting my hands on all three was no easy task . I 've seen sealed 3-packs occasionally sell for over a hundred dollars on eBay ( much , much more than I 'm willing to spend ) , but with a bit of patience , I found them all individually for reasonable prices .
The DDC Dead Prints were initially only sold at a pop-up shop run by Aaron Draplin in Portland , but eventually a handful were sold through their website . There I was able to grab a couple 3-packs before they sold out . Similarly , the LandLand Dead Prints were briefly available on their website , but many of the shipments were lost in the mail , including mine . Fortunately , the good folks at LandLand were able to ship out replacements a couple months later .
The Mondo Dead Prints were trickier . They were initially distributed only at MondoCon , the company 's convention , but some extras were sold online . These became sold out lightning-fast , well before I was able to add a pack to the shopping cart . But , after months of scouring eBay , I eventually found a single Mondo notebook for a relatively low price ( never mind that it 's mostly just a white notebook ) .
After some use , I would n't hesitate to say that these Dead Print Field Notes are one of my favorite editions . Aside from the special cover-paper , there 's no difference between this and a standard Field Notes notebook . However , with their wild designs and the gold-foil used for the cover text , I 've received more comments/compliments on these notebooks than I have while carrying around any other Field Notes edition . It 's really a shame that these notebooks are so rare , but maybe , if we 're lucky , Draplin , LandLand , and Mondo will continue to damage enough posters in order to justify another run .
Additional Notes
Featured Animal Action
American Humane deeply regrets the unfortunate deaths of puppies during the filming of Snow Buddies . American Humane is extremely saddened by these tragedies and is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Investigations Department , which is still conducting an independent investigation into the situation . It is speculated that the unhealthy puppies arrived on the set underage and already ill . The contagious nature of their illness and the stress of their journey compounded the situation . Early in the production , 30 puppies were removed from the set when 15 of them showed signs of illness , eventually diagnosed as giardia and coccidia parasites . Three of these puppies had to be euthanized due to intestinal complications . Parvovirus , a highly contagious canine viral infection , was present in some of the additional puppies brought onto set , which caused six other puppies to test positive for the parvo illness and as many as 28 other puppies to be treated ( for symptoms possibly , but inconclusively , resembling those of parvo ) after exposure to the virus . When the American Humane Animal Safety Representative arrived on the set ( on the first day of filming ) , the puppies were approximately eight weeks old . However , after initial investigations , it is believed that they were only approximately six weeks old when separated from their mothers and brought to the set by the trainer . American Humane 's Guidelines for the Safe Use of Animals in Filmed Media state that productions intending to use puppies under the age of eight weeks must receive written permission from both American Humane and the USDA before filming . This permission was neither requested by production nor granted by either organization . Per the Animal Welfare Act , the USDA does not allow puppies to be transported under eight weeks of age . The USDA is still investigating the breeder who allegedly exported 25 puppies under eight weeks old out of the United States and into Canada -- puppies who might have been ill at the time of exportation . It is also unclear as to how the underage puppies were allowed to cross into Canada , since the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Import Requirements for dogs entering Canada for commercial use state , “ At the time of examination for health certification , the puppies must have been not less than eight weeks of age. ” The required travel health certificates do not support that this requirement was met and indicate the puppies were approximately six and a half weeks old upon examination . The breeder was from New York state and has been charged with fraud by the New York State Police for falsifying health documents .
American Humane 's Guideline indicating that written permission is needed before using puppies under the age of eight weeks was deliberately written so that puppies would not be separated from their mothers earlier or exposed to unnecessary stress . Clearly the intention behind our Guideline was being misinterpreted in this case . Unlike most puppies that arrive on a set for filming at eight weeks old , the puppies had traveled at six and a half weeks old -- by plane for over 3,000 miles , then by car -- enduring a trip of longer than 12 hours , as well as traveling in cold weather . American Humane will be revising this Guideline since it clearly does not give the animals the protection they deserve . We are considering the revision to recommend that no puppies under the age of 16 weeks should be used for filming and we are making more detailed recommendations regarding transport . Sadly , experience has pointed out that unscrupulous individuals will endeavor to circumvent regulations , impelling us to move forward to avoid the filming of eight-week-old puppies in the future .
American Humane has rated this film “ Monitored : Unacceptable ” due to the numerous deaths of young animals and the unlawful and fraudulent behavior that we believe impacted their fate . Although the producers may have been victims of unscrupulous people in their hire , American Humane , as an animal protection organization and the animals ' safety representative , finds the outcomes for these animals unacceptable .
American Humane would like to acknowledge that the production cooperated in every way with the Animal Safety Representative 's recommendations , and once the unhealthy puppies were removed from the set to receive veterinary care , healthy puppies were then brought in -- using proper procedures and following all guidelines regarding age limits , vaccinations , illness prevention methods and other safety protocol -- to ensure that healthy puppies were ultimately used during filming .
Featured Animal Scenes
All adult dogs appearing in the film were experienced sled teams that had worked together . Mushers ( human drivers ) for the teams were professionals , including the child actor who played Adam ( Dominic Scott Kay ) . Before filming began , cast and crew members were instructed on the safety and handling of the animals . All grounds were thoroughly inspected and slopes were tested for snow stability . Only necessary cast and crew members were allowed on the set and all were quiet during filming . Animals were housed in a warm location . Any yellow snow seen in the movie was made using chicken broth . Whenever dogs barked or performed mild action , like jumping on an object close to the ground or walking from point A to point B , they were cued by an off-screen trainer . Before dogs pulled sleds , the snow was groomed with a machine so there would be no footprint holes that dogs could fall into . Before dogs ran uphill , the snow was packed to make it more solid and give them better footing . All food was safe for animal consumption . Camera angles enhanced the steepness of cliffs and hills , and adjacent roads were closed off to traffic during filming . All costumes worn by the dogs were custom-made for comfort .
In one scene , one of the puppies chases a kitten , which runs to its mother , and the mother cat then chases the puppy . The cat and dog scenes were filmed in separate shots ; it looks as if the dog and cats were close together , but they were not actually on set at the same time . To get the kitten to run , one trainer released it at point A and another , off-camera , trainer called it and retrieved it at point B . To get the adult cat to run , one trainer released it on its mark and a waiting trainer used a buzzer to guide the cat in a certain direction .
One of the puppies runs across the street and up the ramp of an ice cream truck . Other puppies follow , all heading into the back of the truck , where they see the first puppy covered in ice cream . For this , an off-screen trainer cued the puppies to walk up the ramp of the truck while another trainer hid inside the truck , calling the puppies . The “ ice cream ” on the puppy was actually yogurt , which was deemed safe for consumption .
The puppies ' parents chase after the truck . For this shot , two trainers released the adult golden retrievers on the closed-off street and cued them to run after the moving truck , which had a trainer hiding inside , calling the dogs .
The puppies are next seen in an airplane 's cargo hold , where they eat some of the ice cream . For this scene , the puppies were placed on a secured platform specially built at window level . A trainer held a food stick just above the camera to get the puppies to look in various directions . The ice cream containers were weighed down with sandbags . Different types of “ ice cream ” covered their faces -- for example , rocky road ice cream was made using plain yogurt mixed with crushed dog food .
Two adult golden retrievers sit on the roof of a house , looking out into the night sky . For this shot , one trainer stood on scaffolding next to the roof 's edge as a precaution . Two other trainers helped the dogs up a series of specially made , secured platforms that led up to the roof . The trainers then placed the dogs on their marks on the roof and cued them to stay . Immediately after filming , trainers helped the dogs down the platforms and back onto the ground below . When the adult dogs are seen on the roof later in the film , the same methods were used , and the howling was a sound effect .
In one scene , the puppies enter a snow cave , seeking advice from a wise old husky . The cave was made of Styrofoam . Four trainers outside the cave released six puppies to two trainers shaking a food bowl inside the cave . All action in the cave was achieved by off-screen trainers giving the dogs verbal cues .
For the scene in which Mudbud stares at their reflection in the ice , the ice was made of wax and a piece of food was placed on the ice to attract the puppy 's attention . The reflection was computer-generated .
The puppies walk across a large log lying on the snow . For this , trainers placed two puppies at a time on the far end of the fake log and another trainer called them to the other end of the log . The fake log allowed for comfortable and secure footing because it was made of a nonslip material and had no jagged “ tree bark ” areas . This scene was filmed on a set with fake snow covering a padded mat . Trainers hid alongside the log in case they needed to catch a falling puppy .
Throughout the film , the puppies are seen in Adam 's shed in several scenes . The shed was heated for comfort . For the scenes in which the puppies sleep in the shed ( in a basket , on a burlap bag and on ropes ) , they were given an hour of play time before filming to release some puppy energy and tire them out a bit . Without any prompting from trainers , the puppies all cuddled up together on a blanket , where they fell asleep . Once they were asleep , trainers carefully moved them to their marks . The shed was checked for debris and hazards before filming , and the area around the shed was blocked off with fencing . As the puppies in the shed are hiding out , they hear a noise , causing them all to look around a corner . They appear to have their heads stacked on top of each other . For this scene , a five-tiered shelving unit was secured to the wall . Each shelf had a wooden safety panel on the back and a safety bar along the edges so puppies could not fall off . Once the puppies were placed on their respective shelves , one trainer stood behind the shelf and another stood behind the camera dangling food on a bait stick and making noises to get the puppies to look in certain directions .
During a montage of the puppies training with Adam , each puppy pulls a log attached to a rope . For this , the puppies pulled lightweight , hollow plastic logs attached to their body harnesses by ropes . Upon filming , trainers released the puppies down a slight hill to make pulling easier . When the puppies first pulled Adam on their sled , they were equipped with a harness attached to a gangline , which was attached to the boy 's waist . Two trainers held the gangline until the director called “ action. ” When the puppies pulled on the line , the child actor fell over on cue .
During a snowball fight , one puppy gets smacked in the face with a big snowball . To make it appear as if a snowball was spinning through the air toward the puppy , a small fake snowball prop was placed on a special rotating contraption mounted to the front of the camera lens . The camera itself then moved toward the puppy as the fake snowball simultaneously rotated in front of it , giving the appearance of a snowball in flight . The camera then cut , allowing the trainer to place some Vaseline on the puppy 's face ( as an adhesive ) and attach fake paper snow . These separate shots were then edited together in post-production .
Adam uses a welder to create the puppy 's sled . The welding tool was fake , and the spark was an effect added later in post-production .
Sled teams race . The adult dog teams , who were accustomed to racing , were lined up at the starting line and cued to run , pulling their sleds and drivers . Before filming began , a snowmobile created tracks for the sled teams to follow , and the snow was packed , which allowed for more solid footing . For the puppy team , the puppies were wearing harnesses attached to a gangline , which was attached to their sled . Their sled was smaller and more lightweight than the adult dogs ' sleds . A trainer called the puppies toward him , and they ran from point A to point B while the child actor , an experienced musher , guided the sled . Several off-screen trainers called the puppies to get them to run and look in various directions . Closer shots of the dogs pulling the sleds were filmed on an indoor set with trainers holding the gangline just out of frame . The earlier scene in which the puppies pull a large empty sled ( made for adult dogs ) was actually filmed toward the end of the production , when the puppies were accustomed to the action of pulling a sled . When two adult teams were racing side by side , they were from the same kennel and were prepared for the close action , so that no aggression would occur . The scene in which one adult team appears to cut off the puppy team 's path was filmed in separate shots . The two teams were never actually on set together for this part of the sequence . The whip used by a musher was fake .
When a female musher falls off their sled , the Saint Bernard rescue dog runs to their aid , licking their face to revive them For this , baby food was placed beside the actor ' head to encourage the licking .
The puppies find shelter from the storm inside an igloo , where they rest on furs and warm up near a fire . The fake igloo was made of wood and plastic . The flame lamp emitted a “ cool flame , ” which allowed it to be cool to the touch . A crew member was standing nearby with a fire extinguisher , just in case . The dogs lay on fake fur rugs . For the part of the scene in which the husky puppy looks out the hole of the igloo , a trainer equipped the puppy with a waist tie . On command , the dog poked their head out of the hole and back inside . To help get the dogs to sleep , they were allowed to play before filming , and studio lights were turned off during filming .
Two dogs who appear to have fallen through thin ice are trying to get out of the water . This was filmed on an indoor set using a shallow pool filled with warm water . The ice was made of plywood covered in fake snow . Trainers surrounded the pool . The dogs wore harnesses attached to a gangline held by an off-screen trainer . Trainers prepared the dogs for swimming before filming began and assisted them in and out of the pool . The dogs were dried off and given 30 minutes of rest between takes .
Due to late notification or limited resources , American Humane did not monitor some of the puppy scenes .
In the UK and in countries around the world , the first day of May has long been seen as a day of festivity .
From pre-Christian times right across the known world , this spring day held great significance , from the Roman festival of Flora and the Walpurga festivities in Germanic countries , to the relatively more modern rites of Morris dancing and the Maypole , commonly seen in the UK .
But amidst spring celebrations , May Day also has long associations with workers , protest , demonstration and rioting .
And St Paul 's Cathedral was right at the heart of one of the earliest of these occasions , now known as the Evil May Day Riots of 1517 .
As in centuries before , May Day was a holiday in the Tudor calendar under the reign of King Henry VIII . But in the weeks leading up to May in 1517 , tension was rising in the City against the many foreigners who had made London their home .
The tension was instigated by a broker named John Lincoln , who had managed to catch the ear of a Dr Bell , due to preach from St Paul 's Cross , in the shadow of the Cathedral . Having been convinced by Lincoln that the woes of the economy were caused by the foreigners in the City , Bell stood at Paul 's Cross and called for all `` Englishmen to cherish and defend themselves , and to hurt and grieve aliens for the common weal . ''
Spurred by these words , tension amongst City dwellers built over a number of weeks before a sudden and violent riot broke on May Day itself . A mob of more than a thousand men congregated on Cheapside and moved through the City looting and destroying all property they suspected to belong to foreigners .
This riot was aimed mainly at French immigrants , but Jews , Dutch and other groups seen as an economic threat were also targeted .
After almost five hours of rioting on that single night , tensions were quelled and calm restored . Hundreds were arrested , many injured , but none killed .
Most of those arrested were pardoned , owing to the mercy of the King 's wife , Catherine of Aragon , but 13 were ordered to death by Henry . John Lincoln was one of those 13 ; hanged , drawn and quartered on Cheapside . At that time , Tudor England was not used to riots on this scale , and life quickly returned to normal .
For the past 500 years London has continued to welcome people from around the world to live and work . Londoners now pride themselves on being part of one of the most culturally and ethnically rich and diverse cities in the world , with more than 300 languages spoken .
Creator of MGM Grand 's lion , Johnson dies at 62
Snellen Maurice `` Snell '' Johnson , a convicted con man who 12 years ago changed the course of their life to become a sculptor whose works include the massive bronze lion in front of the MGM Grand , died Saturday in Scottsdale , Ariz . They were 62 .
`` Snell Johnson certainly is talked about in very positive terms for their work as a post-modern and pop culture sculptor , '' said Robert Tracy , professor of art at UNLV . `` His bronze lion outside the MGM is more acceptable as art than the MGM 's old plaster lion . Their lion has ties with film history , evoking the majesty of Leo ( the MGM lion ) . ''
Johnson 's more than 500 bronze works -- 350 of which are life-size statues -- include horses , American Indians and other human figures . Their works have been purchased by former President Ronald Reagan , late cowboy film legend Roy Rogers and former world heavyweight boxing champions George Foreman and Mike Tyson .
The MGM 's `` Grand Lion , '' created in 1997 , is 45 feet tall , 50 feet wide and weighs 50 tons . It is said to be the largest bronze sculpture monument in the Western Hemisphere .
Johnson 's other works include a bronze statue at the Stratosphere Tower and a massive horse and chariot at Caesars Gauteng , South Africa .
Johnson , a self-taught artist who is considered one of the most prolific sculptors of their time , had to overcome considerable adversity to attain their fame .
In 1979 they were convicted in federal court in Utah for providing false information while obtaining $ 117,000 in loans from a bank in Murray , Utah , according to a Salt Lake Tribune story .
Four years later , the news report says , Johnson was convicted on 30 counts of securities , wire and mail fraud for bilking investors in a satellite navigation company out of $ 2 million . They were sentenced to 25 years , but spent only five years in prison .
Johnson 's life took a 180-degree turn after their release from prison when they resumed an art career that had begun when they were a boy . By 1999 Johnson was commissioned to create an 18-foot bronze clock in Salt Lake City to count down 1,000 days to the 2002 Winter Olympics . The piece was built in 30 days .
Of their many large works , Johnson said in a May 24 , 1999 , Associated Press story , `` bigger and better -- it 's just my personality . ''
Their MGM lion in polished gold bronze is said to be the second largest bronze statue in the world . Only a Hong Kong Buddha that stands 90 feet reportedly is larger .
The MGM statue was commissioned following a revelation that the original MGM entrance attraction -- a huge lion head with its wide-open mouth serving as the doorway -- was considered bad luck by Asian gamblers who comprised much of the megaresort 's high-roller clientele .
Johnson used a crew of 24 to build a Styrofoam prototype of the new statue . It was covered with 1,660 bronze panels . The work was shipped from Scottsdale to Las Vegas in 22 pieces and welded together on a 23,000-pound pedestal .
Other large works by Johnson , an Arizona resident since 1984 , are prominently displayed around that state , including pieces at the Wyndham Hotel in Scottsdale , Harrah 's Ak-Chin Casino near Phoenix and at the Superstition mall in Mesa . Their big statues also adorn at least a dozen Indian reservations .
Johnson was born in Myton , Utah , in the heart of a Ute reservation and grew up in poverty . They said their family did not have electricity until they were 13 and their artwork was one of their few forms of entertainment . Although not an Indian , Johnson credited America 's native people for strongly influencing theirs art .
Johnson studied at Brigham Young University and the University of Utah , served on mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in their 20s and became an insurance salesperson . During their art career , Johnson maintained studios in Deer Valley , Utah , and Scottsdale .
Johnson is survived by their wife , Mary ; three sons , Snell Jr. , Scott and Shawn ; four daughters Sheri , Staci , Shantell and Shaylene ; two stepchildren Michael and Kimberly ; and 12 grandchildren .
Services were Wednesday in Scottsdale .

L. Randall Wray has a post up at New Deal 2.0 which puts forward an idea which is pretty innovative . I would label it a private sector replacement for unemployment insurance . It 's the kind of thinking that might bring Obama out of a policy cul-de-sac as the economy hemorrhages jobs .
Let me present an excerpted version and mention a few concerns one might have with this idea . The link to the full post is at the bottom :
The latest jobs report shows that the official unemployment took a huge jump to 10.2 % –15.7 million jobless workers . If we add to those numbers involuntary part-time workers , plus those who have given up looking for work , the unemployment rate is 17.5 % . Even that seriously undercounts those who would be willing to work if decent jobs at decent pay were readily available–a number I put at 25 to 30 million… I am advocating… a universal job guarantee available through the thick and thin of the business cycle . The federal government would ensure a job offer to anyone ready and willing to work , at the established program compensation level ( including wages and a healthy benefit package ) . To keep it simple , the program wage could be set at the current federal minimum wage ( $ 7.25 an hour ) , and then adjusted periodically as that is raised . The usual benefits would be provided , including vacation and sick leave , and contributions to Social Security . Let 's call this the Job Guarantee ( JG ) program . … A permanent and universal JG program should be decentralized , with projects created and administered locally–where the workers are , and for the benefit of their communities . The federal government would provide the wages , plus a portion of capital and supervisory expenses ( perhaps capped at 25 % of total wages paid for each JG project ) . Local governments and nonprofits would propose projects and cover the rest of the expenses . State unemployment offices would be converted to employment offices , helping to match workers and projects . Project proposals would be submitted to regional councils and , if approved , would be evaluated by state councils and then by a federal council . Wages and benefits would be paid directly to workers ( using Social Security numbers and direct bank deposits ) to minimize fraud . Organizations submitting proposals would be prevented from replacing paid workers with JG workers . For-profit business would be excluded , because the temptation to substitute would be too great . At the same time , businesses would be protected from unfair competition because all JG projects would have to demonstrate they 'd fulfill unmet public purposes . If at some future date , a for-profit firm decided to provide services that a JG project is performing , the JG project could be phased out . There is neither need nor desire for the JG program to compete with the private for-profit sector . …JG workers will be gaining useful work experience and training , making them more appealing to other employers . When firms hire , they will recruit from the JG program , offering a slightly higher wage . At the same time , the program 's fluctuation allows it to act as an employed “ buffer stock ” -or “ reserve army of the employed ” -helping to attenuate the business cycle while maintaining full employment without setting off a wage-price spiral . An economic boom will shrink the size of the JG program ; in a recession the program will grow . Thus , an effort like the Job Guarantee program I am proposing would act as an automatic stabilizer — a feature most would agree is desperately needed in our current rollercoaster economy .
This is definitely outside the box thinking . It is basically a decentralized counter-cyclical works program to largely replace the unemployment insurance program we presently have .
The benefits I see are that it maintains full employment by putting to work those that would be idle and collecting unemployment insurance . We have an enormous number of unemployed people who are drawing significant social welfare payments ( five million are drawing unemployment insurance according to my latest post ) . Why not use a lot of that same money and deploy them .
This approach also would employ a huge slew of longtime unemployed workers that have benefits expire and skills languish , making them harder to employ and increasing structural unemployment . The job guarantee could then reduce the level of structural unemployment that results from a steep downturn ( see Mark Thoma 's recent piece on structural unemployment for a cogent explanation of that issue ) .
In my view , full employment is compatible with free market capitalism . In this approach , a job guarantee is there for anyone who wants it . Any structural unemployment will be largely voluntary .
Here are my questions . I am going to present what I consider the standard questions using the standard terminology – not because these are the exact questions I have but because these are the questions I would anticipate . I have run these same questions by a few economists to generate some answers . I have incorporated most of their answers . But , I still would like to hear your thoughts as well .
Is n't this just an attempt to expand the state i.e . be a move toward big government ? Why should n't we expect ‘ mission creep ? ' Since the idea is designed to fluctuate with changes in the economy , it seems less of a concern . Yes , this is the not-for-profit private sector . But , we would still need to flesh out the safeguards to make sure that it did n't crowd out investment in the for-profit sector . ( You should expect this program to increase the pie and expand investment in aggregate , so that certainly mitigates these concerns as well . ) Wo n't this misallocate resources and create malinvestment ? Since it is designed to be an automatic stabilizer i.e . countercyclical , it does n't necessarily appear so . But , it still might create misallocations by increasing the propensity to spend excessively on infrastructure . Infrastructure spending in the U.S. is probably too low at present . But , at some point in the future , this will be a concern . The fact that much of it can be administered in the private sector locally is important in this regard . How much will this cost ? How do we pay for this ? As I understand the idea , it is designed to replace unemployment insurance entirely – and that means we will recoup in taxes lost output from cyclical and structural unemployment . But , as the Federal Government is paying not just wages but benefits , it does not seem to be a deficit neutral strategy in a employer-provided health-insurance world . If health insurance became detached from employers that would be less of an issue . But , that 's not going to happen . ( I should also point out criminality and imprisonment associated with lack of job opportunities would be reduced , so that certainly decreases any costs – both social and monetary ) .
Personally , I am not especially keen on the ‘ New Deal ' terminology in the original piece . That goes to political/philosophical predisposition . So I have stripped it of that language here .
As an aside , of 1920s and 1930s Democrats , I find Al Smith , the Governor of NY and 1928 Democratic Presidential candidate , far more interesting than FDR . Smith and Roosevelt had a very antagonistic relationship in no small part due to FDR 's co-opting of all of Smith 's 1928 ideas for FDR 's 1932 run . Al Smith was a first-generation Irish Catholic who grew up poor on the lower East Side of Manhattan and owed their rise to Tammany Hall . Prejudice is a big reason they lost to Hoover in 1928 . Roosevelt was a blue-blooded Harvard-educated Aristocrat who was much more palatable to early 20th-century Americans . Try “ Al Smith and Their America , ” or better yet “ Empire Statesman , ” for a good read on Smith .
I suspect Wray 's idea will gain more traction if it can be examined in a politically-neutral frame .
Economists I have talked to who have studied this idea inform me all studies indicate the proposal has a 1-2 % of GDP price tag .
Right now , President Obama seems like they are banking on a recovery that will bring unemployment down . But , this may not end up being so . From a purely political perspective , Wray 's suggestion is the direction Obama should go if they want any traction on the unemployment issue should recovery not bring unemployment down . But , Wray 's idea also deserves more discussion irrespective of the political ramifications because it keeps a buffer stock of skilled , employed people ready to hand for the for-profit private sector to employ .
I look forward to your comments .

Abstract
This study explores the elusive social dimension of quantitative finance . We conducted three years of observations in the derivatives trading room of a major investment bank . We found that traders use models to translate stock prices into estimates of what their rivals think . Traders use these estimates to look out for possible errors in their own models . We found that this practice , reflexive modeling , enhances returns by turning prices into a vehicle for distributed cognition . But it also induces a dangerous form of cognitive interdependence : when enough traders overlook a key issue , their positions give misplaced reassurance to those traders that think similarly , disrupting their reflexive processes . In cases lacking diversity , dissonance thus gives way to resonance . Our analysis demonstrates how practices born in caution can lead to overconfidence and collective failure . We contribute to economic sociology by developing a socio-technical account that grapples with the new forms of sociality introduced by financial models – dissembedded yet entangled ; anonymous yet collective ; impersonal yet , nevertheless , emphatically social .
AFP / Virginia Mayo | ( L-R ) Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu , Turkish EU Affairs Minister Volkan Bozkir , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a European Union summit with Turkey on the migrant crisis , in Brussels , on March 7 , 2016
Turkish premier Ahmet Davutoglu warned there would be no `` bargaining '' over the plight of refugees as they met EU leaders on Friday in bid to clinch a deal to curb the unprecedented numbers reaching Europe .

Davutoglu threw down the gauntlet to the leaders who overnight forged a common position including `` red lines '' that they will present to them at talks in Brussels led by European Council President Donald Tusk .
`` For Turkey , the refugee issue is not an issue of bargaining but an issue of values , humanitarian values as well as European values , '' Davutoglu told reporters as they arrived for the summit .
Underscoring tension with Brussels , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused the Europeans of supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) days after a bombing in Ankara claimed by Kurdish rebels that killed 35 people .
`` European countries are paying no attention , as if they are dancing in a minefield , '' Erdoğan said in Ankara .
Turkey has demanded an acceleration of its long-stalled bid for EU membership , billions of euros in extra aid and visa-free travel in return for taking back all irregular migrants coming to Greece , the main entry point to Europe .
Chief Turkish negotiator Volkan Bozkir drove the point home when they told their country 's pro-government Sabah newspaper that the EU had to accept all the deal 's terms or it would be `` off the table '' .
Many European Union states have expressed concerns about Ankara 's human rights record , including its treatment of the Kurds and a crackdown on critics of the government .
The United Nations and rights groups fear the deal could violate international law that forbids the mass deportation of refugees .
Amnesty International set up a sign outsid the summit venue : `` Do n't trade refugees '' .
EU leaders agreed late Thursday on what was described as a common position but gave no new details about the proposals .
Europe is counting on the agreement to curb an unprecedented wave of migrants , 1.2 million of whom have arrived since the start of 2015 , fuelled by the war in Syria .
Under its terms , the European Union would take in one Syrian refugee from Turkish soil in exchange for every Syrian readmitted to Turkey from Greece .
'Good opportunity '
The aim of the `` one-for-one '' deal is to encourage Syrians to apply for asylum in the EU while they are still on Turkish soil , instead of taking dangerous smugglers ' boats across the Aegean Sea .
The migrant crisis has left Europe increasingly divided , with fears that its Schengen passport-free zone could collapse as states reintroduce border controls and concerns over the rise of populism and anti-immigrant sentiment .
Despite misgivings about the legality of the deal from fellow EU leaders , German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was a `` good opportunity '' .
Merkel however demanded `` preconditions '' and clear plans to deal with the logistics of processing thousands of asylum seekers on the Greek islands and shipping them back to Turkey .
A senior EU official described the proposal Tusk would present to Davutoglu `` everyone 's red lines '' for the negotiations .
Late on Thursday , Tusk presented changes to the deal to address some of the concerns -- including the involvement of the UN refugee agency ( UNHCR ) in any returns and that women and children should form the bulk of those taken under the scheme .
'Modern-day Dachau '
Davutoglu 's delegation heightened the drama when it issued a tweet : `` # EUCO worked late into night for a deal . Now it 's our turn . ''
Besides Tusk , Davutoglu was meeting European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte , whose country holds the six-month EU rotating presidency , before EU leaders meet again for final consultations expected at 1200 GMT .
One major hurdle that appeared to have been overcome was opposition from Cyprus , rooted in long-standing tensions with Turkey over Ankara 's refusal to recognise its government on the divided island .
Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades indicated they could be ready to `` compromise '' on their objections to the EU opening new `` chapters '' in Turkey 's accession process .
The deal also envisages major aid for Greece , where tens of thousands of refugees are trapped in dire conditions after Balkan countries shut their borders to stop them heading north to richer Germany and Scandinavia .
`` I do not hesitate to say that this is a modern-day Dachau , a result of the logic of closed borders , '' Greek Interior Minister Panagiotis Kouroublis told local television after visiting the overwhelmed border town of Idomeni .

Arsène Wenger spoke to the media after Arsenal 's 4-1 win over Galatasaray at the Turk Telekom Arena on Tuesday . You can read a full transcript of their press conference below :
on the win… We gave a strong response . We were dangerous every time we won the ball back , had good penetration , goals and until half-time we were very strong . In the second half we suffered a bit more - some players had not enough competitive games and I had to take two players off . We were a bit more lightweight in midfield . It was , overall , a strong performance .
on the half-time substitutions… Ramsey had a hamstring , but should be alright for Saturday . Flamini had a calf , but should be ok .
on the difference between the first and second ties… They played a different system in the first game , with three centre backs in the first half , tonight it was more a 4-2-3-1 . It was different . what hurt Galatasaray in both games was our pace and power . The dominant player was Sneijder .
on whether they thought Arsenal could win the group… Not at the start of the game , but at half-time yes . But after we had to take Ramsey and Flamini off , it was too much for us to hope we could score six . We were closer to conceding one or two more in the second half . We had stilled our opportunities . No regrets , the players I left at home , I had no choice .
on Ramsey 's second goal ... I felt at the time was not the right decision , but they proved me wrong !
on rumours about Joel Campbell ... Campbell will stay with us .
on Podolski… It is a competition for places that is difficult . I had Welbeck , Sanchez and Giroud at home and you can only play a certain number of strikers . They came back later from the World Cup but they are now coming back to a very strong level .
on advancing to the last 16… Let 's wait for the draw , prepare well . We can focus now on the Premier League . It was my 180th game in the Champions League tonight , we won away from home and are now 15 consecutive years in the last 16 . I believe that is an achievement . Let 's focus on the Premier League and until the end of February , and the FA Cup as well . Hull will not be an easy game . In February , we will see where we stand .
on the team 's ups and downs… We have played a few games where we have not been efficient enough . We have had many , many , many defensive injuries and we have paid the price for that . Overall the dynamic in the team is very good , even in the Premier League .
ADVERT
Danny Welbeck scored the winner against their former club to keep Arsenal 's hopes alive of retaining the FA Cup . On the other hand , this defeat sees United 's only chance of winning a trophy go out of the window . United have been playing poorly for quite some time now but have managed to hold on to the fourth spot in the Premier League . With a very tough line up of fixtures coming up , this defeat is a severe blow to Van Gaal and United 's confidence and chances of qualifying for the Champions League .
The first half was littered with mistakes by both the sides . Arsenal 's first goal was down to some horrendous defending and positioning from the United defence . Antonio Valencia is nowhere close to being a first choice right back ( Although Van Gaal does n't seem to think so ) and Chris Smalling has had enough chances to prove themselves at Old Trafford and their time certainly is up . Angel Di Maria 's tracking back was non existent and the already troubled Valencia was exposed . Nacho Monreal found themselves free on the left and finished with aplomb past De Gea . The whole phase before the goal was a comedy of errors by various United players , first Smalling was completely out of position as they were on the right flank trying to get the ball off Monreal . This forced Valencia to cover for the former as they moved inside , Smalling instead of taking up Valencia 's position on the right moved inside to their natural position , leaving the right free for Monreal to run .
Add to this , Daley Blind in the center was struggling to cope with Arsenal 's pace and Oxlade-Chamberlain had no problem in getting past them and a couple of other players . United responded well after the goal , with Rooney finishing a delicious Di Maria cross with a great header . Although United 's defence had an erroneous first half , the overall picture was looking bright for United with some decent attacks through Rooney and Di Maria .
Van Gaal replaced Herrera with Michael Carrick and Luke Shaw with Phil Jones as Rojo moved to left back . United were finding it tough to get hold of midfield and Carrick was put on to give United more control . But the obvious choice was to remove Fellaini and leave Herrera in an advanced position . But with Carrick and Blind , United 's midfield became static and bereft of ideas and they started playing long balls into Fellaini . Whether Van Gaal wanted United to go route one or was it a byproduct of a static midfield and a lack of creativity is a question only they can answer . Fellaini has certainly been effective in the recent past , but there is no reason why United with the attacking talents they have should resort to lumping forward to Fellaini . Ander Herrera certainly did n't set the world alight in the first half , but was the only player on the pitch who was capable of linking United 's deep double pivot with their attack . With Carrick and Blind sitting deep and Fellaini in an advanced position just off Rooney , United had no option other than to play it long to the Belgian . Rooney who had a bright first half was now just hovering around Fellaini hoping for a knock down or two . The game was almost over with Di Maria 's sending off albeit for a few more long punts to Fellaini which resulted in nothing .
United at the moment are clearly in a bad shape all over the pitch but the concerning matter at the moment is instead of attempting to solve the issue , Van Gaal is just relying on long balls and Marouane Fellaini . Along with their ‘ philosophy ' , Van Gaal also has failed so far as a man manager and a motivator . Di Maria does n't seem motivated enough and all the defenders have actually regressed from last year under Moyes and that 's saying something . Still Van Gaal gets very less criticism from fans and media compared to Moyes at the same stage , albeit after spending tons of cash . United is now in serious danger of not qualifying for the Champions League for the second year running and the board will have a decision to make at the end of the season if the same happens .

My TSA Encounter - by Matt Kernan ...
“ You do n't need to see their identification . ”
On November 21 , 2010 , I was allowed to enter the U.S. through an airport security checkpoint without being x-rayed or touched by a TSA officer . This post explains how .
This past Sunday , I was returning from a trip to Europe . I flew from Paris to Cincinnati , landing in Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport .
Since I had nobody waiting for me at home and no connecting flight to catch , I had some free time . I decided to test my rights .
After putting all my stuff through the x-ray , I was asked to go through the Backscatter . I politely said that I did n't want to . The technician quipped to their colleague , “ We 've got an opt-out. ” They laughed . They turned back and started to explain .
After they finished , I said , “ I understand what the pat-down entails , but I wanted to let you know that I do not give you permission to touch my genitals or the surrounding area . If you do , I will consider it assault . ”
They called their manager over , who again informed me of the policy . Throughout this event , this happened quite a few times . After raising my concerns regarding the policy to an officer , they often simply quoted back the policy . For the sake of brevity , I will simply say “ Policy restatement . ”
I said , “ I am aware that it is policy , but I disagree with the policy , and I think that it is unconstitutional . As a U.S. citizen , I have the right to move freely within my country as long as I can demonstrate proof of citizenship and have demonstrated no reasonable cause to be detained . ”
Policy restatement . “ You have two options – the Backscatter or the pat down . It is your choice , but those are the only ways you can go through security . ”
I asked if I could speak to their manager .
“ I 'm the supervisor here . ”
“ Do you have a manager ? ”
“ Yes , but he 's very far away at the moment . And he 'll say the same thing I am. ” Policy restatement .
At this point , I took out my iPhone , activated the voice recorder , and asked The Supervisor , “ Per my constitutional rights , I am not allowed to be detained without reasonable cause for arrest . Now , am I free to go ? ”
They answered , “ If you leave , we will call the APD . ”
I asked , “ Who is the APD ? ”
“ The Airport Police Department . ”
I said , “ Actually , that 's probably a good idea . Let 's call them and your manager . ”

Part 4 of my encounter with TSA . This is an uncut recording of the escorted walk out . Not much here except for the beginning minute or so and the last 10 seconds .

Three year-old boy being strip searched ...
Ninety-five years ago , an American woman traveled alone throughout South America with the aim of spreading awareness of a new religion that had begun in Persia a few decades earlier . They crossed the Andes mountains on the back of a mule over an ancient trail 10,400 feet above sea level , wearing `` three suits of woolen underwear , two sweaters , two coats and a steamer rug '' to keep from freezing . At one point of the journey , they and their travel guides went through a dark tunnel that `` took over an hour in stumbling , slipping blackness in which the frightened mules shied and fell . '' They said many prayers for protection for their traveling party . Them name was Martha Root , and their prayers on that journey were the first Baha ' i prayers to be said in the Andes Mountains , and their trip the first time the Baha ' i teachings were brought to Chile .
Martha Root was to make many trips around the world spreading the Baha ' i Faith , which is now the second most widespread religion worldwide after Christianity . In the foothills of the Andes Mountains to the east of Santiago , Chile , a new spectacular Baha ' i Temple is taking shape -- a testament to how far the community has come in the country since its humble beginnings .
Much has and will be written about the building itself , winning architectural awards and acclaim . With nine translucent wings made of a special kind of marble and cast glass , it will allow sunlight to filter in during the day and a soft glow of light to radiate out at night . Even during its construction , the temple is having a tremendous effect on the Baha ' i community and the wider public in Chile .
A Senator of the Republic of Chile , Mr. Francisco Chahuán , recently said while on a visit to the temple site :
I have no doubt that this place is destined to be a center of prayer , meditation and gathering , especially considering that one of the fundamental pillars of the Baha ' i Faith is unity in diversity . It will also invite all of the inhabitants of Peñalolén and the whole country to seek a place of tranquility and retrospection , where they can effectively discover the innermost depths of their being and connect to their highest aspirations .
One of the foundational teachings of the Baha ' i Faith is the recognition that a new stage of history has arrived out of which a global civilization will , in stages , emerge . The nation of Chile is an interesting example of this : geographically and historically isolated by vast mountains and oceans , it is now increasingly being connected with , and contributing the unique talents of its peoples to , the rest of the world . The design of the South American Baha ' i temple reflects this concept , with each of the pieces of marble panels being unique in size and shape , and yet assembled and harmonized in such a way as to create an exquisitely beautiful whole far greater than the sum of its parts .

Another key idea embodied in the design of the temple is the unity of spiritual with material , and service with worship . In a conversation with Eduardo Rioseco , Director of the Temple , they reflected on the theme of the `` quest for justice '' in Latin America that many believe after several decades is still largely unresolved . Questions such as educational reform , inequalities in economic opportunity and the quest of people to take charge of and find their own path in life they believe are deeply connected to the vision of worship and service as a way to achieve justice that the temple symbolizes .
Since construction started , the Baha'is had been holding a series of conversations with the residents of the area to discuss the vision of society they wish to build and how citizens can feel empowered to transform themselves and their neighborhoods . They have been working in schools to have conversations with high school age youth to take on responsibilities for service to younger children ; as one example , the older youth organized the painting of a mural in a school dedicated to the younger children and created toys with recycled materials to give to the children .
Residents of the area increasingly see that their own personal transformation and the upliftment of their neighborhoods are intimately connected , and that this process is in their own hands . Thus the temple creates a vision of hope , creating a feedback loop of worship , service and transformation .
The temple will be open to all without charge , and the services will include readings from the sacred scriptures of all the world 's religions . At a time when many recent headline news stories , particularly from the Middle East , show the tremendous damage that occurs from acts of religious fanaticism and intolerance , it is also important , for the future of an increasingly globalizing world , to consider news stories that highlight the beneficial effects of religion at its best , inspiring people to nobler acts of service and inclusivity .
The words of Baha ' u'llah , the Founder of the Baha ' i Faith , provide a fitting meditation on this theme with which to conclude :
VDOT still wants a bike trail on the shoulder . Image by MPD01605 licensed under Creative Commons .
Virginia is planning to build a new trail while widening I-66 , but their proposal would put joggers and bicyclists on the highway itself , next to speeding cars . State highway officials insist that moving the trail anywhere else would mean taking more land , pitting advocates against neighbors who do n't want to lose part of their yards . But it does n't have to be this way .
The Virginia Department of Transportation wants to widen I-66 between the Capital Beltway and Haymarket to as many as ten lanes , including a mix of general and High Occupancy Toll ( HOT ) lanes . In some spots , that means multiple new lanes are going to be added , particularly in parts of Oakton and Vienna in Fairfax County where the highway is only six lanes ( not including the shoulders that get used as extra travel lanes during rush hour ) . Construction could start later this year .
There are also plans for a new trail along the highway . Parts of the trail already exist ( like the Custis Trail in Arlington ) and being able to connect multiple trail segments to create one long one would be a real boon to Northern Virginia 's cyclists and hikers .
But right now , parts of the proposed trail would put users on the highway itself , between the sound barrier and the shoulder . It would technically be a trail , but not one that really abides by any of the best practices of trail building . It would force trail users to walk or bike next to traffic , exposing them to noise and vehicle exhaust , and making the trail hard to reach from surrounding neighborhoods .
While bicycling advocates want to move the trail , VDOT insists they would need even more space in order to place the trail next to the highway . Meanwhile , neighbors who are already losing part of their yards due to the highway . Last weekend , the Washington Post interviewed homeowners living next to I-66 who fear losing even more land if the trail is moved , and are worried about strangers using a trail that went behind their homes .
Again , most of the space being taken is to add lanes to an already-wide highway . Even if you think it 's “ obvious ” that I-66 has to be widened , the impacts of doing that ( like having to condemn land to add lanes ) are far larger than the effects of moving a trail .
The issue is n't the trail , it 's the highway
Virginia 's Transportation Secretary Aubrey Layne told the Post that it 's “ not fair ” to change designs now to help make the trail better . What they are really saying is that everyone 's concerns about the project are valid when it means highways get to be wider , but not when people point out a huge flaw in the plan to help people who would use the new trail .
We have been here before . Ten years ago , the Intercounty Connector in Maryland was a new highway that came with the promise of a parallel trail . But most of the trail was never built because state officials did n't want to add more pavement , even though the highway itself was one giant impervious surface .
A growing number of state officials are weighing in to ensure that the I-66 trail actually works for people on foot or bikes rather than simply an afterthought . We do have the knowledge on how to design a better trail , and it starts with moving it off of the highway .
Trail users are n't greedy simply for asking that things be done right the first time . And transportation officials should not be the ones to pull a bait and switch ( again ) on residents who simply expect what was promised . What is ultimately not fair is the expectation that highways are forever in need of expansion , and we can only accommodate other travel modes ( be it transit , walking , or biking ) if there 's space left over .
Supporters of the Arkansas Medical Cannabis Act stand with boxes of signatures backing their proposal at a news conference Monday , June 20 , 2016 . - Photo by John Moritz
Supporters of one of three marijuana-legalization proposals submitted more than 117,000 signatures Monday to Secretary of State Mark Martin , pleading that their efforts to legalize the drug will fail if multiple measures make the November ballot .
Immediately afterwards at the State Capitol , groups opposed to recreational and medical marijuana painted all three proposals as a `` backdoor '' for healthy people to smoke `` pot . ''
Arkansans for Compassionate Care have drafted one of two proposals related to medical marijuana . The group 's Arkansas Medical Cannabis Act would set up 38 no-profit dispensaries across the state regulated by the Department of Health , according to its website .
A `` hardship '' provision in the law would allow people living in rural areas far from the proposed dispensaries to grow up to five plants .
Melissa Fults , a campaign organizer who is also running for a seat in the State House of Representatives , said the group had validated 85,000 of the signatures , which it collected over a multiyear campaign .
Another ballot proposal aims to amend the state constitution allowing for medical marijuana but does not include the provision for individuals to grow plants . A third proposal aims to legalize recreational marijuana .
Family Council Action Committee President Jerry Cox told reporters afterwards that they were supportive of Fults ' `` grassroots '' organization to collect the signatures , but opposed any attempts to legalize the smoking of marijuana .
They said they were certain Arkansans would not approve either measure .
Before walking boxes of signatures down to Martin 's office , campaign organizers and pro-marijuana patients pleaded , tearfully at times , for support on the Arkansas Medical Cannabis Act , which they said would provide relief from pain as well the intense side effects of chemotherapy .
Fults said the two dueling medical marijuana proposals were both nearly certain to fail if they appeared together on the ballot .
`` If there are two on the ballot , it will make us fight so much harder , '' they said . `` If we put the two camps together , there is no way we can fail . ''
Cox said they would rather see neither proposal make the ballot . They said a pushing for a legislative fight to override a successful ballot act would face a tough fight .
Constitutional amendments can only be changed by a popular vote .

New cases of Ebola could reach 10,000 per week by December as the virus outbreak races out of control in West Africa , World Health Organization officials said Tuesday .
WHO Assistant Director-General Bruce Aylward also said the death rate , which had been estimated at about half of those who become infected , has risen to about 70 % .
Aylward said there have been about 1,000 new cases reported per week over the last month . They said WHO is aiming to isolate 70 % of cases — and to have 70 % of victims buried quickly and safely — within two months to reverse the outbreak .
`` A lot more people will die '' if the crisis response is n't stepped up within two months , Aylward said . They said WHO 's goal is to begin seeing a week-to-week decline in the number of new cases in the Ebola hotbeds of Liberia , Guinea and Sierra Leone within 90 days .
The disease is expanding into more areas of those countries , Aylward said . But they stressed that overwhelmed treatment centers would not consider isolation without treatment .
`` It would be horrifically unethical to suggest that we 're simply going to isolate people , '' they said . New strategies such as handing out protective equipment to families and setting up very basic clinics is a priority , Aylward added .
As of Tuesday morning , 8,914 Ebola cases and 4,447 deaths had been reported to WHO . Aylward stressed that the true number of deaths and infections is probably much higher .
Federal health officials will rush dedicated Ebola teams to any U.S. hospital that confirms an Ebola case , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Thomas Frieden said Tuesday .
Frieden also said officials have thus far failed to determine how Dallas nurse Nina Pham contracted the virus during treatment of Thomas Eric Duncan , who died last week at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital .
The 48 people who had contact with Duncan before they were hospitalized have reached 14 days without symptoms , Frieden said , meaning their likelihood of contracting the disease has lessened . About 76 health care workers had contact with Duncan or their blood while they were hospitalized , and all are being monitored closely .
Still , Frieden acknowledged at a news conference Tuesday that more CDC experts should have been sent more quickly to the Dallas hospital .
`` We should have put an even larger team on the ground immediately , and we will do that any time there is a confirmed case , '' Frieden said .
The CDC has sent 20 staffers to Dallas . In the event of future outbreaks : `` We will be there , hands on , within hours , to help the hospital deal with the situation . ''
Two nurses from the specialized biocontainment unit at Atlanta 's Emory University Hospital are in Dallas to review the hospital 's procedures . Frieden said the CDC is recommending that hospitals limit the number of people allowed into the Ebola unit and have a 24-hour site manager to oversee all aspects of the unit .
If necessary , Frieden said future Ebola patients could be transferred to one of the four hospitals in the USA with specialized biocontainment units . Two of them already have treated Ebola patients — at Emory and Omaha 's Nebraska Medical Center .
Pham , 26 , issued a brief statement through Texas Health Presbyterian saying they are `` doing well '' and thanking the medical team providing them care .
`` I 'm doing well and want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and prayers , '' the statement said . `` I am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world here . ''
Texas Health Resources CEO Barclay Berdan also released a statement , saying the `` hearts and prayers of everyone at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas are with Nina Pham , and we are working tirelessly to help them in this courageous fight . The doctors and nurses involved with their treatment remain hopeful , and we ask for the prayers of the entire country . ''
Frieden said one person who had contact with Pham was being monitored but thus far is healthy .
Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings also reported that Bentley , Pham 's King Charles spaniel , was doing well and also showing no signs of the virus . The dog was moved to a secure , undisclosed location after Pham checked themselves into the hospital .
`` He 's wagging their tail , eating , drinking water , '' they said . `` Cute as a button . ''
Pham became infected while treating Duncan , the first Ebola patient to die in the USA . Pham , who graduated from Texas Christian University 's nursing program in 2010 , is the first person known to contract the disease in the USA .
They have received a transfusion of plasma from Kent Brantly , a Texas physician who survived the virus , according to the non-profit medical mission group Samaritan 's Purse . Brantly 's plasma should contain antibodies valuable in fighting the virus .
Also Tuesday :
• Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that they and their wife , Priscilla , will donate $ 25 million to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control Foundation to help fight Ebola .
`` The Ebola epidemic is at a critical turning point , '' Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post , adding that the couple believes the money will `` directly help the front-line responders in their heroic work . These people are on the ground setting up care centers , training local staff , identifying Ebola cases and much more . ''
• In Germany , St. Georg Hospital in Leipzig announced that a 56-year-old United Nations staffer died early Tuesday of the disease `` in spite of intensive medical care . '' They had tested positive Oct. 6 .

By TesfaNews ,
THE Ethiopian Defense Ministry today announced that two of its Air Force pilots and their two MI-35 helicopter gunships have defected to Eritrea .
In a face saving message read out today on the state television ( EBC ) , the defense ministry alleges that it was rather a hijack by two disgruntled pilots forcing the flight technicians and co-pilots to fly to Eritrea last Friday while on training .
This is the first time the Ethiopian government acknowledges defection of its air force pilots and military planes . The estimated cost of each helicopter gunship is between 25 and 35 million dollars .
The two missing pilots are identified as Captain Samuel Ghidey and Lieutenant Yililign Mekonen .
On the other hand , Eritrean officials , as always , neither acknowledge nor deny on reports of such nature although the defection to the country by high profile Ethiopian military and air force personnel is on the increase .
The Amsterdam based Ethiopian Satellite Television ( ESAT ) was the first to confirm the defection of the pilots and missing of two military helicopters from the Ethiopian Air Force inventory .
Ethiopian Air Force is no stranger to such high profile defection . In October of this year alone , Four SU-25 Fighter Jet captains deserted the Air Force and join armed opposition groups that are based in Eritrea .
This year alone , a total of 10 Air Force pilots have abandoned the regime and defects to Eritrea with an identified number of fighter jets and helicopters .
You 're credited with the creation of one of the most eccentric mascots in all sports : Western Kentucky 's own Big Red . How would you describe Big Red , in your own words ?
Big Red is a personality , a character in the true sense . Unquestionably the ultimate WKU fan , Big Red is also a bit unpredictable and that may add to the creature 's mystique . Big Red is your lovable , quirky neighbor who is fun to be around ... but you 're still not sure if they are who they appear to be . The character was designed to leave you wondering .
How did you get involved in Western Kentucky 's search for a mascot ?
I was a student and two fraternity brothers , both WKU cheerleaders , mentioned the university was looking for ideas for a new mascot . It sounded like an interesting challenge , so I offered to get involved .
Did your experience with Hanna-Barbera and Kings Island Amusement Park in Cincinnati give you any advantages when creating Western Kentucky 's legendary mascot ?
The Kings Island experience made it possible . I performed in costume during the summer at the theme park . I knew how to entertain . Big Red was 100 % built around the ability to engage an audience . The character is designed to communicate a variety of emotions , to move freely and to see without obstruction . I wanted it to be a high performance vehicle vs. other university character costumes . It is a mascot 's mascot , designed with every advantage a performer could ask for .
What were some of your initial concerns or goals during the mascot creation process ? Did you have a general idea as to what this mascot would look like or need to symbolize ?
As to the design , the creature needed the performance characteristics mentioned ( visibility , the ability to move ) as well as a gimmick . I consider the character 's mouth a gimmick . It allows for the translation of a wide variety of emotions , as well as the ability to 'swallow ' anything smaller than a three-year-old child . It could only be red and it certainly was big . The goal was always to make it unique to WKU .
My initial concern was that Big Red as a concept might be too far out there . I was on an island and if the character was a bomb , all fingers would point in my direction .
Big Red 's theatrical persona seems to have always existed ; they were presented as a Christmas present from Santa Claus at a basketball game in 1979 , emerging from a white box with a bow . What was the crowd 's reaction to Big Red ? Were you at all surprised by it ?
Standing in the dark inside Santa 's present minutes before the initial unveiling was surreal . Because of my prior performance experience , I knew that out of the box , the character 's persona needed to be large , dramatic and entertaining .
The crowd 's initial reaction was favorable . That energy fueled the first performance . I was too panicked about the potential of Big Red being a flop to slow down long enough to be reflective . I had thought the debut went well but like any performer , I went to bed that night worried about the coming media reviews and comments from the WKU administration . When responses were universally positive , there was tremendous relief .
Did you ever think that the `` red blob '' you created over three decades ago would be such a growing , prominent symbol of the university today ? What has it been like to see Big Red in places such as SportsCenter commercials , the Ellen DeGeneres Show , and the annual Capital One Mascot Challenge ?
It was a dream of mine that Big Red might someday receive broader recognition , but my vision did not include frequent appearances in ESPN commercials , or on daytime TV talk shows . I recognize Big Red is still around due in part to Western Kentucky University who fully embraced the character and has skillfully managed it for more than 30 years . For this I am personally grateful . It 's nice to leave a mark .
CONCORD , NH — A local state representative has been charged with assault in Concord District Court and is scheduled to be arraigned in late September , according to court documents . The charge was filed against Katherine Rogers , 61 , pictured left , of Alton Woods Drive in Concord , on Aug. 7 , 2017 , by the New Hampshire State Police . According to a complaint , on Nov. 16 , 2016 , during the recount for the District 7 state Senate seat held at the state archives building , Rogers allegedly struck Susan Olsen , a 2nd Amendment activist and former state Rep. candidate from Warner , `` with a semi-closed right hand squarely on ( her ) left ear . ''
Editor 's Note : This post was derived from information supplied by the Concord District Court . It does not indicate a conviction . This link explains the name removal request process for NH Patch police reports .
The alleged assault occurred after both Rogers , representing then-incumbent state Sen. Andrew Hosmer , D-Laconia , and Olsen , representing then-challenger Harold French , R-Franklin , were ballot observers during the recount and were given a chance to challenge or accept ballots shown to them . ( For more information on this and other neighborhood stories , subscribe to Concord NH Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts . )
`` Ms. Rogers challenged many of the first ballots shown to us and , as this was my ( first ) time serving as a recount observer , I did not understand the bases for their challenges , '' Olsen noted in their complaint .
Olsen then requested the ballots be placed `` closer , '' so they could see them , and that 's when they allege that Rogers put their hand on their shoulder , `` as if to hug me , '' reportedly stated they wanted Olsen to be `` happy , '' and then allegedly struck them Olsen stated that they said to Rogers , `` If you strike me again , I will have you arrested . '' They alleged that Rogers , a former county attorney , countered , `` in a low , mocking , angry whisper , '' something to the effect of `` Hit me . I know you want to . Go ahead . Hit me . ''
Olsen claimed that Rogers was `` smirking '' while they were speaking and then , reportedly leaned in further , `` sounding almost like they were daring me , '' and allegedly stated , `` I know what you want to do . You want to shoot me . ''
Olsen stated they were so stunned by Rogers and their comments that they could n't – and did n't – respond and that they did n't want the proceedings to be disrupted any longer than they already had been .
After the first batch of ballots were eyed , Olsen stated that Rogers left the table and was replaced by another person .
Olsen said they did n't report the incident to police at the time to preserve `` the integrity of the recount '' and for fear that it would be viewed as `` a political statement '' since Olsen had testified against a number of Rogers ' bills , including gun control proposals . They noted a number of witnesses including state officials and state Rep. Steve Vaillancourt , R-Manchester , who passed away earlier this year . Olsen added that they filed the complaint after the `` recent rise of hyperbole and incivility '' in the General Court .
`` Certainly , words may not hurt me , but I do not believe anyone has the right to put their hands on anyone else without their permission , '' they stated .
Rogers is due to be arraigned in Concord District Court on Sept. 29 .
French was deemed the winner after the recount by less than 20 votes , according to WMUR-TV . District 7 covers Andover , Belmont , Boscawen , Canterbury , Franklin , Gilford , Laconia , Northfield , Salisbury , and Webster .
Rogers did n't return an email requesting comment about the charge .
MONTREAL – The Octavio Zambrano era officially began on Tuesday night at Stade Saputo where the Canadian men 's team earned a 2-1 win over Curacao in an international friendly .
It was an evening of many firsts : the Reds ' first match on home soil this year , the first game in charge for Zambrano since being appointed manager , and the first senior-team appearances for four talented youngsters .
Tuesday 's tilt was also Canada 's first and only tune-up match before this summer 's CONCACAF Gold Cup .
Here are some thoughts on the game :
You have to crawl before you can walk
When they took over the reins back in March , Zambrano publicly stated their goal was to help Canada , currently 109th in the FIFA world rankings , become a dangerous attacking side . That 's no small feat considering the Reds ' historical scoring problems . Not only did Canada bow out in the group stage of the last three Gold Cups , they only scored one goal over the course of those three tournaments .
Tuesday 's outing was a disjointed one from an offensive perspective . The opening half was pretty poor from Canada , who struggled to break down Curacao and put together stretches of quality build-up play . Striker Cyle Larin looked far too isolated at times as they were denied service from their midfield . Only after Zambrano made changes in the second half did Canada come alive in attack and dictate the pace of the match .
You may not want to hear this , but patience is required . Zambrano only had the players in for their first training camp for about a week before Tuesday 's game , so it was hardly a surprise that they did n't automatically gel . It was unrealistic to think that the Reds were going to come out guns-a-blazing and overwhelm even a modest team such as Curacao . Zambrano is playing the long game here . In the meantime , expectations have to be tempered .
“ We will get that consistency as the days go by and as the players begin to understand what we 're trying to do . I saw glimpses of it [ tonight ] — quick play , changing the point of attack , being aggressive and looking for the ball . I ca n't say I 'm completely pleased about everything , but you ca n't ask for more at this stage , ” Zambrano told reporters after the match .
Solid showings by the youngsters
Notwithstanding Larin 's ineffectiveness , Canada 's youngsters acquitted themselves quite well against Curacao . Four prospects earned their first caps for Canada : Toronto FC 's Raheem Edwards ( who was in the starting 11 ) , Vancouver Whitecaps teenager Alphonso Davies , Mark-Anthony Kaye and Juan Cordova . Any time Canada can blood four young players and allow them to gain valuable international experience has to be considered a good night .
It was Davies ' introduction early in the second half that breathed life into Canada 's limp attack , with the Whitecaps star taking on Curacao 's defenders and causing problems in the final third . Montreal Impact forward Anthony Jackson-Hamel , another youngster who entered the game as a second-half substitute , used their speed and size to bully Curacao 's back line before scoring the winner in the 86th minute . It was their second goal in only their fourth appearance for Canada .
Zambrano was encouraged by the displays of their debuting young players , and felt the inexperienced Davies has a bright future both for club and country .
“ Youth really has nothing to do with it in terms of how much you can contribute on the field . I thought [ Davies ] came in and made a big difference , ” Zambrano said .
Zambrano later added : “ There is no fear factor with him . He 's a seasoned player even though he 's young . They have some incredible tools . … They have an immense career ahead of him . We 're just seeing the beginning of what they can give us . ”
No fear . That 's it , exactly . Davies plays with no fear , and it 's that kind of attitude that Canada 's attack has long needed .
The poor attendance : It 's actually a good thing
Large swathes of Stade Saputo were completely barren on Tuesday night . Exactly 27 fans were sitting in the East Stand behind Curacao 's goal just minutes before kickoff . Yes , I actually counted . Canada Soccer announced the attendance at 6,026 , but honestly , that looked to be a charitable estimation .
Social media blew up over the disappointing attendance , with Montreal being chastised for not coming out to support the Canadian men 's team . Debates raged as to whether or not the city should be allowed to host another national team game , and whether the match would have drawn more fans had it been held elsewhere .
Here 's the thing to remember : This was a mid-week friendly against Curacao , a nation with little soccer pedigree and who most people likely could n't pick out on a map . I could n't do it . Only after doing a quick Google search did I discover the tiny island is located off the coast of Venezuela .
It 's wrong to expect Zambrano to immediately turn this Canadian team into world-beaters . It 's also misguided to think the Reds should automatically command a grand audience whenever they play on home soil .
Truth be told , Stade Saputo was the perfect venue to stage this game . Montreal is a very tough sports market . The people here love big events — be it Formula One or UFC — and they love winners . Aside from the Canadiens , pro teams and other sports have to fight for every scrap of attention they get .
Tuesday 's sparse turnout provided more evidence of the hard work that lies ahead for Zambrano to make this Canadian men 's side become relevant . That 's not a bad thing . In fact , it 's a good thing . There should be no false pretence about where this team currently stands in the Canadian sports landscape . Respect should be earned , not automatically given .
WEST Coast is preparing to use its only pick in Wednesday 's rookie draft to revive the career of delisted Carlton ­midfielder Kane Lucas .
Lucas was one of the most highly-rated midfielders in the 2009 national draft pool when they were taken by the Blues at No.12 , but the East Fremantle product has managed only 42 games in five injury-interrupted seasons . The 23-year-old shapes as a low-risk option for the Eagles , where Lucas could rebuild their confidence with East Perth in the WAFL and add to the club 's midfield depth .
DRAFT INSIDERS : MOVERS AND SHAKERS
Complicating Lucas ' fate is the fact the Eagles will now only have one selection in the rookie draft , when they had planned to save two spots for new rookies .
The Sunday Times understand Lucas remains at the top of West Coast 's wishlist ahead of the rookie draft , to be held at 8am on Wednesday , and that there is little interest in the on-baller from rival clubs . West Coast was keen to use only three selections in Thursday 's national draft to allow for an extra rookie pick , but coach Adam Simpson said the chance to take Damien Cavka at No.66 was too good to refuse .
“ We just could n't pass them up . We had them a lot higher than what they were presented at , so we did n't hesitate to pick them up , '' Simpson said . “ It just means we 've got one less ­rookie pick . ''
The WAFL system is set to add to the nine draftees the state provided on Thursday , with a host of contenders ­nervously waiting for a rookie draft lifeline after being ­overlooked this week .
They are likely to have to move interstate , given West Coast and Fremantle have just one live rookie pick each .
The Dockers have committed to redrafting delisted ­defender Tanner Smith as a rookie with their other selection . The rookie draft has ­unearthed star players over the years including Brownlow medallist Matt Priddis , ­Fremantle midfielder Michael Barlow and champion ruckmen Dean Cox and Aaron Sandilands .
While the resources put into drafting have increased massively over the past decade , WAFL talent manager Raff Guadagnino said they still ­believed gems could slip through to the rookie draft .
We 've all been there .
Agence France-Presse reports that a German man in Munich allegedly had to flee to the police after a woman demanded too much sex .
After several amicably agreed upon rolls in the hay , the man reportedly tried to leave the woman 's apartment . But they would n't let them exit and instead allegedly insisted on more sex . That 's when the man ran to the cops for help , according to authorities .
Perhaps the woman in question was unaware of a study reported on by Forbes that found that , while women can , for the most part , never have too much sex , men can .
Penile tissues , if given too roistering or prolonged a pummeling , can sustain damage . In cases you 'd just as soon not hear about , permanent damage .
And the German man might not be alone in their desire for a bit less sex .
“ Self-awareness ” in the pigeon : A replication

Gallup ( 1970 ; 1984 ) and others have argued that behavior directed towards bodily marks visible only in a mirror may serve as an operational definition of “ self-awareness. ” According to this definition , Gallup would claim that only humans , chimpanzees , orangutans , and perhaps gorillas may be labeled “ self-aware . ”
1 . Gallup 's procedure :
While the animal is anesthetized , the upper brow and ear are smeared with rouge . Upon awakening , the animal is exposed to a mirror . Experimenters observe whether the mirror occasions species-specific social behavior . If the animal instead investigates its body and touches the rouge-marked location , such behavior is interpreted as evidence of so-called “ self-awareness . ”
In 1981 , Epstein , Lanza and Skinner published a Science paper in which they showed the spontaneous appearance of mirror-mediated , self-directed behavior in pigeons .
2 . Epstein , Lanza , & Skinner 's ( 1981 ) procedure :
In successive phases , two repertoires were trained : ( a ) localizing the origin of blue stimuli briefly reflected in a mirror , and ( b ) in the absence of a mirror , pecking at stick-on dots pasted to the feathers . The first repertoire familiarized the animals with the properties of a reflective surface , while the second established a history of self-directed behavior under “ no mirror ” conditions .
In subsequent tests , the birds met Gallup 's “ self-awareness ” criterion . A blue dot was placed on the pigeons ' feathers and covered with a cotton bib . As a control for tactile stimulation from the bib or the dot , movements toward the bib were counted while the mirror was covered . No such movements were observed . Once the mirror was uncovered , however , the dot under the bib was visible in the mirror as long as the birds stood upright and their beaks pointed toward the mirror . Spontaneously and without food present , pigeons emitted the same mirror-mediated , self-directed behavior Gallup had defined as evidence of “ self-awareness . ”
Subsequent replications of Epstein , Lanza , and Skinner ( 1981 ) remained either unpublished ( e. g. , Cheney 's unpublished successful replication cited in Epstein [ 1996 ] ) , or unsuccessful ( Thompson & Contie , 1986 ) . Continuing discussions of “ awareness ” ( Dymond & Barnes , 1997 ) misinterpret the procedures of Epstein , Lanza , and Skinner .
Cardinal ( aka , Drossel ) , Allan , Barnes , and DeLabar ( 1998 ) reported a successful replication of the original Epstein , Lanza , and Skinner study and provided a clear demonstration of spontaneous , mirror-mediated , self-directed behavior in the pigeon . A new chamber was constructed that allowed controlled analyses of the mirror-mediated behavior . Photographs of the chamber as it is presently configured are offered below .
A further replication , together with additional data derived from a series of control conditions , waspresented at the Association for Behavior Analysis Annual Conference , Chicago , Illinois ( 1999 ) , in an attempt to clarify the contributions of the several trained repertoires to successful mirror-mediated , self-directed behavior in the pigeon .
Figure 1 . View of the chamber from the hopper side . The extensive wiring allows for computer control of keylights , food hopper , and houselight . Additional wiring allows for computer-monitoring of a floorboard panel closure , infrared hopper entry , and key pecking . The chamber is 56 cm long x 29 cm wide .
Figure 2 . Details of wiring , including 4 electromechanical relays controlling keylight presentations . Also depicted ( in the midst of all the wires ) is a standard BRS/LVE food hopper . In the background the optically-isolated input and output relays may be seen just in front of the computer keyboard .
Figure 3 . Looking from above the chamber enclosure the response keys may be seen hanging on either Plexiglas wall . The keys have been designed to be moved gradually closer to the mirror and are angled so that the key surfaces may be seen from a distance only by looking into the mirror . The reflections of those key panels can be seen in the mirror positioned opposite the hopper wall .
Figure 4 . With the vinyl floor mat removed , details of the spring-loaded floorboard panel may be seen clearly . The microswitches are designed to detect the position of the pigeon in the chamber .
Figure 5 . A less oblique view of the mirror surface ( see Figure 3 ) showing reflections of both key panels and the hopper opening .
Figure 6 . After more than 1.5 months training , a partition was inserted between the left and right banks of keys to prevent the pigeons from seeing both key banks simultaneously . The number of correct entries ( left or right ) was used to judge accurate mirror use ; i.e. , if the pigeons entered the left side when an upper or lower-left stimulus was present , then a correct response was counted . If the pigeons entered the side without a stimulus before entering the correct side , an error response was counted .
Figure 7 . Top view clearly depicting the partition separating the left and right stimulus-key banks . The mirrored wall is at the top of the photograph with key banks placed close to the mirror surface . The partition prevents simultaneous viewing of left and right key banks , thereby forcing the pigeons behavior toward the side with an illuminated key .
Figure 8 . Pigeon # 3 wearing a vinyl bib that will partially cover a dot that , from the pigeon 's view , may only be seen when looking into the mirror while standing erect . This photo was taken from an habituation session .
Figure 9 . Pigeon # 3 wearing a new cotton bib . The new covering was created because the pigeons ' responses did not habituate well to the vinyl version . After 3 habituation sessions , all four birds appear to direct very little behavior at the bib .
Figure 10 . Pigeon # 3 in the mirror test – the bib and dot can be plainly seen .
Figure 11 . Pigeon # 3 looking into the mirror , after which they immediately begins bobbing and pecking at the dot they can not see directly ( see Figure 12 , below ) .
Figure 12 . Pigeon # 3 soon after looking into the mirror !
Movie clip . Pigeon # 3 at the start of the mirror test ( plus bib , plus dot ) . Initially , you will see some “ confused ” behavior , followed by bobbing and pecking at the dot which they can only see in the mirror ! And psychologists have been telling us for years that only humans and some primates can pass this test…hmmm…a successful replication of Epstein , Lanza and Skinner , 1981 .

WASHINGTON -- President Obama announced Thursday evening a plan to put the long-term jobless back to work by encouraging states to adopt `` Bridge to Work '' programs that would let businesses try out workers without having to pay them .
The scheme , which would only be open to workers receiving federal unemployment benefits , would be modeled mainly on a Georgia program designed to reduce hiring costs and make it easier for the jobless to get back to work . The program , called Georgia Works , is voluntary for workers and employers and allows businesses to train workers for eight weeks with no obligation to pay or hire .
`` We have to do more to help the long-term unemployed in their search for work , '' President Obama said while addressing a joint session of Congress . `` This jobs plan builds on a program in Georgia that several Republican leaders have highlighted , where people who collect unemployment insurance participate in temporary work as a way to build their skills while they look for a permanent job . ''
Labor advocates have warned the White House to stay away from Georgia Works , complaining that it is exploitive and possibly illegal . A senior administration official said the White House is sensitive to those concerns . `` We have made it very clear that states must ensure compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act , '' said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Bridge to Work programs would be different from Georgia Works in several ways . Under the Obama proposal , states would be required to ensure participants earn no less than the minimum wage . So if a jobless worker 's unemployment insurance benefit amounted to less than the minimum wage , states would have to boost the benefit .
Bridge to Work programs would only be open to jobless workers who 've exhausted the standard 26 weeks of state-funded benefits and become eligible for the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program , which provides up to 53 additional weeks of aid . The EUC program is set to expire in January ; the administration is pushing for Congress to reauthorize it through 2012 as part of the `` American Jobs Act , '' which would include funding for Bridge to Work and dozens of other initiatives .
Republicans controlling the House of Representatives have signaled support for a program modeled on Georgia Works , but they 've also said they 'd oppose another reauthorization of federal unemployment benefits if the cost added to the federal budget deficit .
`` If the millions of unemployed Americans stopped getting this insurance , and stopped using that money for basic necessities , it would be a devastating blow to this economy , '' Obama said . `` Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber have supported unemployment insurance plenty of times in the past . At this time of prolonged hardship , you should pass it again -– right away . ''
Money for states to administer Bridge to Work programs would come from a $ 4 billion `` Reemployment NOW Fund '' that would also support a range of reforms , including wage insurance , startup assistance , improved reemployment services , and work-sharing .
There is n't a ton of data on Georgia Works or similar programs in other states . But there 's plenty of data testifying to the magnitude of the long-term unemployment crisis : According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , 6 million people have been out of work for six months or longer as of August , and 2 million have been out of work for longer than 99 weeks -- the cutoff point for federal jobless benefits in the hardest-hit states .
States that decided to adopt Bridge to Work initiatives would have some flexibility . Training periods could last as long as eight weeks or be as short as two weeks . Businesses could train participants for up to 38 hours a week ( Georgia Works limits training to 24 hours a week ) . States could also require participating employers to pay a portion of workers ' earnings .
`` We 're going to deem these [ Emergency Unemployment Compensation ] benefits wages and provide support for states to top up benefits if necessary to comply with the minimum wage , '' the official said . `` If states want to structure programs so employers have skin in the game , we 're not going to stop them . ''
Participants in the program will be covered by workers ' compensation laws . As the FLSA requires , states will be required to prevent businesses from using trainees instead of hiring new workers , and businesses will not be able to use Bridge to Work participants if a strike is in effect or if doing so would violate a collective bargaining agreement .
This story has been updated to include remarks from President Obama .
More than 200 people are being detained at the camp US President Barack Obama has for the first time admitted that the US will miss the January 2010 deadline they set for closing the Guantanamo Bay prison . Mr Obama made the admission in interviews with US TV networks during their tour of Asia . They said they were `` not disappointed '' that the deadline had slipped , saying they `` knew this was going to be hard '' . Officials are trying to determine what to do with some 215 detainees still held at the US prison in Cuba . Mr Obama 's announcement follows considerable speculation that the deadline would slip , as the administration wrestles with how to deal with those inmates who can not either be freed or tried in US courts . Please turn on JavaScript . Media requires JavaScript to play . They did not set a specific new deadline for closing the camp , but said it would probably be later in 2010 . `` We had a specific deadline that was missed , '' they told NBC . And they told Fox News : `` It 's hard not only because of the politics . People , I think understandably , are fearful after a lot of years where they were told that Guantanamo was critical to keep terrorists out . '' Closing the facility was `` also just technically hard '' , they added , and depended on co-operation from Congress . Domestic opposition Moving to close Guantanamo was one of Mr Obama 's first acts in office . ANALYSIS Paul Reynolds ,
BBC News website world affairs correspondent President Obama 's admission that they will not close Guantanamo Bay by their target of 22 January is not a surprise given that their senior officials have been hinting at this for some time . The problems have proved more complex than expected . Most difficult of all is what to do with those prisoners against whom there is not enough presentable evidence to use either in a civilian or a military court . The US government is trying to get foreign countries to take them but has had limited success . There is some domestic opposition to their transfer to the US itself . A nearly-empty prison in rural Illinois is being considered to house them . The president 's statement is an acceptance that this will not be resolved in time . On 22 January 2009 , just two days after inauguration , they set a deadline of a year for closing the heavily-criticised prison . Their administration says it will try some detainees in US courts and repatriate or resettle others not perceived as a threat . Last week , Attorney General Eric Holder announced the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and four other defendants would be transferred from Guantanamo to face trial in a New York federal court . Some lawmakers and relatives of 9/11 victims reacted angrily , arguing that the move put Americans at risk . Asked about domestic opposition , Mr Obama told NBC that the anger over Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 's civilian trial would disappear `` when he 's convicted and when the death penalty is applied to him '' . And in separate comments to CNN , they said that the notion that `` terrorists possess some special powers that prevent us from presenting evidence against them , locking them up and exacting swift justice '' was a `` fundamental mistake '' . In terms of other detainees , five have been ordered to face military commission trials in the US and a number of others , including several Chinese Muslim Uighurs , have been cleared by investigators for release and resettled overseas . But the issue of detainees assessed as dangerous but who for legal reasons could not be successfully prosecuted in US courts remains unresolved . The BBC 's Jonathan Beale , who is at Guantanamo Bay , says the announcement of the delay to the deadline has come as no surprise . The question of where to put those detainees who can not be freed or tried remains a huge political obstacle , they say .

A problem that many people face is how to distinguish truth from falsehood on the Internet . This is apparently a significant problem because I am often asked this in personal conversations about my method of researching truths on the Internet . I therefore want to introduce the method I use and which has formed my conception of the world through the vast amount to information available on the Internet .
Dynamic conception of the world
The first realization is that I do n't need to have any final conception of the world . My knowledge is continually subject to change . I am ready to change my view on something which I have already accepted or rejected I should find sufficient evidence of the opposite . I find it is necessary to be able to live with this uncertainty once you depart from the `` mainstream '' view of the world . I think it is even a sign of maturity , if you do not follow the beliefs given out by the mass media anymore .
Thus the picture of the truth that I build up is liable to fluctuate . Nevertheless it is in a kind of `` dynamic balance '' . It serves me well as I can understand the events in the world much better now and through this I have gotten calmer .
Three categories : true , false , unknown
I put any statement that I find on the Internet roughly into three categories : true , false or unknown . The third category is an important one . Many people are reluctant to live with uncertainty . They want to decide right away when confronted with new information on whether it is true or false . However , this can lead to problems because it can cause an entire construction of beliefs to be based on falsehood . It is better not make an immediate decision on some new statement when you are unsure . Instead , you can keep the information in the back of your head until later . Later on you will perhaps be in a position to confirm or to disprove this statement from other sources .
Two independent sources
An important criterion for the establishment of the truth is whether the same assertion is made by at least two sources that are independent of each other . In such a case I will assume that this assertion probably is true . Of course it is often a problem on the Internet to find out from which sources the information has come from . Frequently the sources are indicated , however , or one can recognize whether the text was simply copied/pasted .
Cui bono ?
Another important criterion is the question , which you should ask on every piece of news : `` Whom does the distribution of this information serve ? '' . One can often recognize an intention in reports to trigger a certain reaction from the reader . Once you have recognized this , you can further try to find out for whom this reaction would be useful . If the use does n't serve the general public but instead certain interests or individuals , then I will assume that it is likely a falsehood or at least a half-truth . I am also aware that the best lies are those which are mixed with the truth .
Another piece of the puzzle
A slightly weaker criterion is whether an assertion fits smoothly into my existing conception of the world , like a missing piece in a jigsaw puzzle . Ideally this new knowledge would be able to explain unsolved phenomena or give a more satisfying explanation .
Frequently this is the only criterion , which I can use , since much information can not be verified independently on the Internet and does n't have any clear `` disinformation intention '' either .
Reputation is unimportant
What is n't a criterion for the establishment of the truth to me is the so-called `` prestige '' or `` reputation '' of a source . It is far too easy to lead people who rely on such a criterion astray . To do this one can simply imagine that somebody with a nefarious intent would establish a respected news source that always reports the truth . Whenever the creators of this news source would deem it necessary this source would start to put out false information instead . Should this news source then lose its reputation , a new one would be created .
It is therefore important to check every statement individually and not rely upon the fact that the source of this information has always told the truth until now .
Not using Occam 's Razor
Occam 's Razor is the principle in science of using the least amount of assumptions to explain a phenomenon . However , what is valid for science , primarily in the natural sciences , does n't have to be valid in the area of the human interactions ! It is correct to use this principle for the examination of Nature , because Nature is almost always structured optimally in some way . People however often behave less than optimally and even completely irrationally . They often do things ineffectively or make affairs unnecessarily complex .
For example , if police inspectors were to use this principle in solving their criminal cases , the criminals who were aware of this could outwit them easily . They could escape suspicion by committing a crime in an unnecessarily complex or circuitous way . The police inspector then would conclude with the help of Occam 's Razor that they would not be considered one of the suspects because they as criminal must have behaved in a nonsensical fashion .

PHILADELPHIA – On Thursday , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued its long-awaited verdict on the Federal Communications Commission 's disputed media ownership rules . The court threw out FCC rules that would have allowed one company to own a newspaper and broadcast stations in the same market and upheld the FCC 's decision to retain its other local broadcast ownership restrictions . The court also instructed the FCC to better consider how its rules will affect and can promote ownership by women and people of color. “ Today 's decision is a sweeping victory for the public interest , ” said , policy counsel of Free Press . “ In rejecting the arguments of the industry and exposing the FCC 's failures , the court wisely concluded that competition in the media – not more concentration – will provide Americans with the local news and information they need and want. ” The case , Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC , represents the second time the Third Circuit has jettisoned the FCC 's attempt to relax its media ownership rules . The first was in 2004 , when the same panel of judges struck down then-Chairman Michael Powell 's attempts to gut media ownership limits.The current case stems from an FCC decision under then-Chairman Kevin Martin in 2007 to lift the 35-year-old ban on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership . The FCC action prompted court challenges from public interest groups , including Free Press , seeking to encourage more competition and diversity in the media industry , as well as from big media corporations that wanted all of the media ownerships rules thrown out.The court vacated the FCC 's decision to relax the ban on common ownership of local broadcast stations and newspaper located in the same market , finding that the Commission 's rule-making procedures were highly irregular and failed to give the public adequate notice and opportunity to weigh in . The court also determined that record evidence supports the FCC 's decision not to relax any of the other media ownership rules. “ Today the court confirmed that the FCC 's media ownership rules are not only constitutional but necessary to preserve competition , as well as to promote diverse sources of news and information for the American people , ” said Wright , who argued the case along with Andrew Jay Schwartzman of Media Access Project , on behalf of Prometheus Radio Project , Media Alliance , the Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ and Free Press . The Georgetown Institute for Public Representation also provided legal counsel for the public interest groups.The court blasted the FCC for its repeated failure to consider the impact of its rules on media ownership opportunities for women and people of color . It took the FCC to task for ignoring Free Press research showing that media concentration makes it harder for new entrants and underrepresented groups to become broadcast media owners. “ Innovative and creative media entrepreneurs deserve the opportunity to serve local communities – but they ca n't break through when large corporations have a lockdown on local media markets , ” said Wright.The court 's findings are key as the FCC embarks on yet another review of media ownership limits this summer . That proceeding , which was supposed to be completed in 2010 , has stalled while the FCC awaited the court 's decision. “ Even though the court upheld the need for media ownership limits , industry groups are still pushing the FCC to eliminate them , '' Wright said . `` It 's not the Commission 's job to protect industry profit margins . The FCC can not ignore the overwhelming evidence that existing media consolidation levels adversely impact the amount and quality of news from diverse sources . Instead it should tighten current ownership limits and promote media diversity , localism and competition. ” View the full decision here : http : //www.freepress.net/resource/third-circuit-decision-prometheus-radio-project-vs-federal-communications-commission

Days after their mother nearly disowned them after discovering they wore makeup , 18-year-old Jauan Durbin is being met with a wave of support online .
On Saturday , the Morehouse College first-year student tweeted out a screenshot of a text conversation they had with their mother .
`` I do not approve of this bullshyt , '' their mother wrote , referencing a photo of their son , with their face fully made-up . `` [ What the hell ] is wrong with you ? I am so disappointed . You are a male . [ Why the hell ] do you have on eyelashes , eyebrows and makeup . ''
`` I 'm completely done , '' they concluded . `` OK , '' they responded .
They captioned the tweet : `` This hurts . It really does . But I 'm going to live my truth until the day I die . ''
Lol , this hurts . It really does . But I 'm going to live in my truth until the day that I die .
The post immediately went viral , racking up over 5,000 retweets and 14,000 favorites in the days since it was first posted . The response has been mixed .
There was praise ...
Ok they trippinn ' that cut crease ? ! Those eyebrows ? ! Shit IM PROUD OF YOU ! Xo https : //t.co/LmLVy6JeS9
support ...
I am proud of you . For standing boldly in this truth , your truth , & doing so fiercely . You are my family , my community , and I love you . ? ? ? ? https : //t.co/S6kBYId7b4
disapproval ...
Huge shoutout to this mom for speaking the truth and not accepting their sons bullshit . This mom deserves better . https : //t.co/j6xT7c78Cj
and ridicule :
Nigga you fuckin weird and yo momma shoulda swallowed you https : //t.co/2yK9iesLwL
The photos were first taken backstage the Miss Maroon and White 2017 Pageant , where Durbin was assisting . Their friend had offered to do Durbin 's makeup in addition to the contestants . In an interview , Durbin said they had never had their makeup done in this way . `` I 'm a model , but I had never worn a full face with lashes , it 's only been minimal to be camera-ready , '' they said .
Happy with the results , Durbin first posted the picture on Twitter . Their scholarship program mentor then put the photo on Facebook , tagging Durbin . Shortly thereafter someone took a screenshot of the picture and sent it to their mother . That 's when the text conversation began .
Durbin said they posted the conversation to let others struggling with parental acceptance know they 're not alone .
`` I did n't post the original screenshot to put my mom out there , it was more so that I knew there were other people out there going through the same situation that I 'm going through and many do n't know if there 's a way out of it , '' they said . `` So I wanted to affirm them with my comments attached to the screenshot . That you should always live in your truth no matter if your parents do n't agree with it . You seek validation from your parents , you try to live up to their expectations , but sometimes their expectations are unrealistic . ''
Jauan Durbin
Since their mother first discovered the viral tweet , they and their mother , who he 's described as having a rigid sense of gender norms , have not communicated .
Durbin has words for those who feel they should have kept this a private matter : `` First of all , you 're not in my shoes , '' they said . `` I 'm sorry that you feel that way but I 've empowered way more people through my actions of posting that . ''
He 's not being hyperbolic . According to Durbin , they have over 200 messages piling up on Twitter of strangers thanking them for being strong , not only for himself , but for them .
I 've gotten almost a 100 DMs similar to this . This is why I posted what I posted . It was n't about me . It was BIGGER than me .
The outpouring of support , they said , is like a `` low-key band-aid '' on what they describe as metaphorical `` cuts and bruises '' from the harsher words some have lobbed at him .
Durbin also has a message for the parents of any young adult who may not adhere to society 's exacting gender norms . `` It 's not about support . It 's about affirmation . Loving your child because it 's your child regardless of the circumstances . I would encourage the parents to sit down with their child and ask questions . Even if you do n't necessarily agree with them wearing makeup , just know that something that makes them happy should make you happy . ''
As for their relationship with their own mother , Durbin is hopeful . `` I believe that my mom will come around eventually . I feel like a conversation will probably be facilitated between some family member between them and me . I did n't do this to upset my mom . Throughout the whole process I 've tried to take myself out of the process figuratively because there 's people that see themselves in me and I want the message to go out to children that it 's okay to be you and you should n't change who you are for anyone . ''
President Donald Trump is significantly decreasing the size of the federal bureaucracy , a campaign promise they often referred to as “ draining the swamp . ”
The administration downsized permanent staff at all cabinet-level departments by the end of Sept. 2017 , except for at Homeland Security , Veterans Affairs ( VA ) and Interior , The Washington Post reported Saturday . Hundreds of federal positions have been removed as a result of the administration 's commitment to retool and shed some of the two million federal government employees .
The federal workforce grew sizably under both former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama , ballooning from roughly 1.8 million employees in 2000 to 2.14 million at the height of Obama 's presidency .
Trump 's administration is moving at a historically slow pace in filling political positions at federal agencies , whether it be part of theirs “ draining the swamp ” promise or a slow movement on the part of the Senate is unclear .
The Senate has only confirmed 240 of the over 600 political appointments that are supposed to help carry out the administration 's agenda .
Agencies the administration has chosen not to shrink do make some sense .
Keeping employment levels higher at Interior , the VA , and Homeland Security is in line with the Trump administration 's “ America First ” policies , like its push for border security , improving veterans affairs and infrastructure spending , that is already shaping up to be the key legislative agenda of 2018 .
Trump , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and GOP leadership are looking to get infrastructure rolling out the gate in January , a goal they believe will get bipartisan support . Infrastructure has been a Democratic campaigning platform for decades , but the party 's leadership is facing heat for failing to get a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals deal done in 2017 — a situation that could prove troubling for Republicans infrastructure push in the coming year .
In addition to its push to shed some of the federal workforce , the administration is trying to deregulate the economy , slashing environmental , financial , and other federal regulations .

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D. , N.Y. ) on Friday spoke at the annual Personal Democracy Forum at New York University , where they delivered profanity-laced remarks .
`` Has [ Trump ] kept any of these promises ? No . Fuck no , '' Gillibrand said , prompting the crowd to cheer .
`` Sorry , I understand this is a younger audience . It 's OK , '' the New York Democrat added .
Later in the event , Gillibrand recycled a line from their New York Magazine interview in April , saying if Democrats are not helping people , `` we should go the fuck home . ''
The moderator asked Gillibrand about Trump 's tweet from last week in which they sent out a message with the made-up word `` covfefe . ''
`` I think it was ‘ coverage ' and they were bitching about the media and they just forgot to finish , '' the senator said .
`` I wish I could bleep some words , too , but my 90-year old mom is sitting in the front row , '' the moderator said .
`` Oh God bless you , I 'm sorry , '' Gillibrand said , covering their face with their papers .
The crowd started laughing , prompting Gillibrand to say , `` You just got me in trouble . ''
There was a mixed reaction on Twitter to Gillibrand 's profanity during the forum .

Over the course of the 1960s , the FBI amassed almost two thousand documents in an investigation into one of America 's most celebrated minds . The subject of this inquiry was a writer named James Baldwin . At the time , the FBI investigated many artists and thinkers , but most of their files were a fraction the size of Baldwin 's . During the years when the FBI hounded him , they became one of the best-selling Black authors in the world . So what made James Baldwin loom so large in the imaginations of both the public and the authorities ?
Born in Harlem in 1924 , they were the oldest of nine children . At age fourteen , they began to work as a preacher . By delivering sermons , they developed their voice as a writer , but also grew conflicted about the Church 's stance on racial inequality and homosexuality .
After high school , they began writing novels and essays while taking a series of odd jobs . But the issues that had driven them away from the Church were still inescapable in their daily life . Constantly confronted with racism and homophobia , they were angry and disillusioned , and yearned for a less restricted life . So in 1948 , at the age of 24 , they moved to Paris on a writing fellowship .
From France , they published their first novel , Go Tell it on the Mountain , in 1953 . Set in Harlem , the book explores the Church as a source of both repression and hope . It was popular with both black and white readers . As they earned acclaim for their fiction , Baldwin gathered their thoughts on race , class , culture and exile in their 1955 extended essay , Notes of a Native Son .
Meanwhile , the Civil Rights movement was gaining momentum in America . Black Americans were making incremental gains at registering to vote and voting , but were still denied basic dignities in schools , on buses , in the work force , and in the armed services . Though they lived primarily in France for the rest of their life , Baldwin was deeply invested in the movement , and keenly aware of their country 's unfulfilled promise .
They had seen family , friends , and neighbors spiral into addiction , incarceration and suicide.He believed their fates originated from the constraints of a segregated society.In 1963 , they published The Fire Next Time , an arresting portrait of racial strife in which they held white America accountable , but they also went further , arguing that racism hurt white people too.In their view , everyone was inextricably enmeshed in the same social fabric . They had long believedthat “ People are trapped in history and history is trapped in them . ”
Baldwin 's role in the Civil Rights movement went beyond observing and reporting . They also traveled through the American South attending rallies giving lectures of their own . They debated both white politicians and black activists , including Malcolm X , and served as a liaison between black activists and intellectuals and white establishment leaders like Robert Kennedy .
Because of Baldwin 's unique ability to articulate the causes of social turbulence in a way that white audiences were willing to hear , Kennedy and others tended to see them as an ambassador for black Americans—a label Baldwin rejected . And at the same time , their faculty with words led the FBI to view them as a threat . Even within the Civil Rights movement , Baldwin could sometimes feel like an outsider for their choice to live abroadas well as their sexuality , which they explored openly in their writing at a time when homophobia ran rampant .
Throughout their life , Baldwin considered it their role to bear witness . Unlike many of their peers , they lived to see some of the victories of the Civil Rights movement , but the continuing racial inequalities in the United States weighed heavily on him .
Though they may have felt trapped in their moment in history , their words have made generations of people feel known , while guiding them toward a more nuanced understanding of society 's most complex issues .

by sheldon chanel suva
One of the victims of the shocking nude Fijian young women image racket spoke out for the first time yesterday .
The victim , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , broke their silence in the hope that other young women would learn from their experience , which they are still recovering from .
They are the first victim to shed light on the release of the 900 photos and videos of nude young women in a Dropbox .
They said they were so depressed at one stage that they thought of taking their own life .
Snubbed by their friends ; blackmailed by their own cousin brother in an attempt to sleep with her ; dumped by their boyfriend for being an “ embarrassment ” – this is a story of a victim , a University of the South Pacific student .
People they had never seen before would point and stare at her ; cars would slow down to have a look ; close to 10 separate Facebook users messaged them asking if they would sleep with them for money .
They called it an “ incurable disease . ”
And all that for a mistake they made three years ago when they faithfully allowed their boyfriend of two years to take an intimate picture of them .
This is the story of a girl who nearly lost everything , all because of a mistake they made as a young adult .
The mistake of trusting someone who said loved them Them story :
“ I made a mistake . I was in a relationship with a person when I was 16 . I considered it to be my first love . We were together for two years and it was during this time when we started sleeping together . We were planning for a future together .
I naively thought it was a sign of love to be photographed with my partner in an intimate setting . Everyone else was doing it so when they proposed the idea , I did not say no .
We broke up and we moved on , or so I thought . Last year in October , a year after we had broken up , I started receiving calls from my friends . The pictures had been uploaded on the Dropbox with pictures of other University of the South Pacific students . My naked pictures were out there for the world to see .
I was devastated , I panicked , cried and even thought about ending my life . What made it worse was when my very own cousin , a person I had grown up with had called up and asked to sleep with me in return for keeping the pictures from circulating in my family .
It took a lot of courage not to succumb to what they were suggesting . I confided in my mum who became my pillar of strength . We decided not to inform my father of the pictures as they have certain medical conditions , but those pictures were sent to my entire extended family . My entire extended family had seen me in a condition that I had never imagined .
My papa came to know about it from their brothers . I cried more , wanted to die . Papa stopped talking to me and thoughts of suicide started crossing my mind regularly . My mum stood by me .
After two months , papa spoke to me again . They understood that I had made a mistake and trusted the wrong person . They told me to focus on my studies and to move on .
But , it was harder for my brother . Even today , they do not speak to me as they did before . They refused to allow me to tie them a Rakhi until mum stepped in and had to force them not to deny me this right . My younger sister and I no longer share the bond we did before .
Sometimes I just randomly start crying when I think about some of the things I 've gone through . People start whispering when I am out in town . Strangers point at me and talk . I suffer from depression and the leak worsened my situation . I could n't sleep for days and my schoolwork began to suffer as a result .
No one in my family wanted to officially lodge a Police complaint about something so sensitive , fearing that more people will find out .
It took a while for me to trust someone but another person came in my life . When they came to know about the photographs , they were too embarrassed to be seen anywhere with me and we broke up .
They left me . They left me when I needed a shoulder to cry on .
I am scared to enter into a new relationship . What if they find out about my past and just leaves me ?
To the girls whose pictures have been leaked , I want to say that the damage is done . Do not be scared and live your life now .
And to the people behind the leak : how would you feel if your sister 's or your girlfriend 's picture was leaked in the same manner ; would you still share it with everyone ?
At the moment I am just trying to move past everything that happened . I know I made a mistake but so has everyone else .
I have my whole life ahead of me and I am going to try and fulfill my dreams even after everything that 's happened . ”

Kevin Feige has famously said that Marvel Studios already has plans through 2028 . With the roster of heroes Marvel still has left , we can believe it . This is Part four of a five part series . Part 1 is the Marvel Retro Realm . Part 2 the Marvel Horror Realm . Part 3 is the Marvel Cosmic Realm . Part 5 is the potential of the Inhumans in the Marvel Cinematic Universe .
Though Marvel has a full universe , it 's generally segmented into specific realms ; high science , street crime , magical horror , and more . Even now , Marvel Studios is paving the way for multiple realms within the MCU . James Gunn has said that GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY will lead to a distinct Marvel Cosmic realm , unattached to the Avengers . Marvel 's Netflix series , beginning with DAREDEVIL , Marvel 's building a street-level realm , focused on crime , drugs , and vigilante violence .
AGENTS OF SHIELD started life as a spinoff of THE AVENGERS , but really grew into its own after CAPTAIN AMERICA : THE WINTER SOLDIER . AGENTS OF SHIELD has strong footing as Marvel 's premiere spy program , examining the geopolitical landscape of the MCU after the rise of Hydra . The show continues to grow into new territory , bringing the Inhumans into the MCU years before the film 's debut . Since it seems CAPTAIN AMERICA : CIVIL WAR will focus more on the Avengers , AGENTS OF SHIELD looks to remain Marvel 's leader in the espionage realm .
SHIELD is so well-established that this article focuses exclusively on existing characters , rather than hypothetical . Marvel has such a strong roster of spies and soldiers that AGENTS OF SHIELD can be the staging point for a new wave of spy-oriented films and TV shows .
Mockingbird is definitely the breakout of SHIELD 's second season . Agent Bobbi Morse , played by Adrienne Palicki , is AGENTS OF SHIELD 's most charismatic agent . She 's deadly with a pair of batons , and incredibly smart : before they were Agent Bobbi Morse , they were Dr. Bobbi Morse , with a PhD in biology . It 's tough to say what a MOCKINGBIRD TV series would be about , since their arc on AGENTS OF SHIELD is n't finished yet . Bobbi is known to be collaborating on a top-secret project with another SHIELD agent , Mack Mackenzie . It 's possible that the two could could leave SHIELD to pursue their own agenda , investigating threats separate from the SHIELD/Hydra war .
One thing we 're pretty confident about is that of all the Agents of SHIELD , Morse is the most likely to join the Avengers . Mockingbird is a long-time Avenger , and Palicki has the charisma to stand alongside Marvel 's premiere superheroes . With Scarlett Johansson 's contract set to expire soon , it 's very likely that Mockingbird could be the Avengers ' replacement for Black Widow . A MOCKINGBIRD TV series would be the best way to highlight the character before shipping them off to the big leagues .
If Mockingbird does join the Avengers , she 'll have some very interesting dynamics with the other team members . In the comics , Mockingbird is the ex-wife of a very prominent Avenger…
Hawkeye is Marvel 's misfit Avenger , completely absent thus far from Phase Two , and definitely the least memorable character in THE AVENGERS . In a film with super-soldiers , super-geniuses and super-gods , it 's hard for a mere archer to stand out . That 's unfortunate , because comic readers know how special Hawkeye is . In the comics , Hawkeye is the sort-of guy who was reluctant to join the Avengers because they were worried they would slow them down . Jeremy Renner does n't seem too expensive for a HAWKEYE miniseries , and the best place to start is Matt Fraction 's acclaimed comics run .
Clint Barton might be an Avenger , but more importantly , he 's just a regular guy . They foil a criminal conspiracy , but spends weeks in rehab ( Fhe Rehab ) working off their injuries . They wear hearing aids because a sonic weapon rendered them mostly deaf . They try to mentor Kate Bishop , a teenage prodigy with a bow , but they wind up being a better partner than a student . They feed their dog exclusively pizza , they drink coffee out of the pot , and calls Tony Stark to help them fix their DVD player . What makes HAWKEYE special is watching what one of Earth 's Mightiest Heroes does in their off-time .
Though HAWKEYE would be a light-hearted slice of life , our next hero is about as angsty as they come…
Winter Soldier remains one of the most enigmatic , mysterious & unpredictable characters currently in the MCU . Though we know their origins and backstory , we do n't really know what direction Bucky will travel in the future . Brain-damaged and traumatized , Bucky is seemingly running into the wind , with Captain America not far behind . Early word is that Bucky will be a major player in CIVIL WAR ; though we do n't yet know if he 'll survive , Marvel 's not really in the business of killing its heroes .
Our ideal WINTER SOLDIER TV series would be a blend of contemporary action and flashbacks . We would see a Winter Soldier assassination decades ago , and flash forward to the modern day as Bucky tries to atone . All the while , they track down the elements of Hydra that lead to their creation , and makes sure that there will be no further Winter Soldiers .
In the comics , Bucky eventually becomes the new Captain America after Steve Rogers ' death . Though we have a hard time seeing Marvel kill Rogers in the MCU , if Rogers goes into hiding , Bucky could very well “ borrow ” the shield until Cap resurfaces .
Though Marvel is the one debuting these heroes , all of them have something in common : each of them start their cinematic life as villains .
Loud , mean and ugly , the Thunderbolts are a team of reformed villains . Or sometimes , not-so reformed . The Thunderbolts ' roster is very flexible , since most of the team is generally on their way back to prison or planning their next criminal scheme . The Thunderbolts are usually lead by a hero barely managing to keep the chaotic team in line .
Unlike the rest of the items on this list , THUNDERBOLTS really seems like it would be better as a film ( directed by James Gunn ? ) . The roster of the team would pull from the best of Marvel 's super villains . Mockingbird would lead the team , trying to wrangle a group of the biggest egos in the universe . We do n't know which of these characters will be alive in the future , but our ideal team would be…
Tom Hiddleston 's wily Loki ;
; Sebastian Stan 's haunted Winter Soldier ;
; Guy Pearce 's egotistical Aldrich Killian ;
; Tim Roth 's psychotic Abomination ;
; Karen Gillan 's vicious Nebula .
It 's hard to imagine the circumstances that bring this team together , especially Nebula , but we can dream . The Thunderbolts would absolutely shred anything standing in their way , if they do n't tear each other apart first . Sequels , of course , would change and expand the roster . Characters like Punisher , Ghost Rider , Venom and Elektra have passed through the Thunderbolts .
What 's exciting about AGENTS OF SHIELD is how deep its roots run throughout the MCU . With strong ties to Captain America , and the debut of the Inhumans , SHIELD is already building Marvel 's densest sub-universe . Given how large it already is , and given how many heroes we left off this list ( Deathlok ! Spider-Woman ! Falcon ! ) , it 's very easy to imagine how much larger Marvel 's Espionage Realm can truly get .
Which of Marvel 's heroes are you ready to see graduate into their own solo adventures ? Sounds off in this Reddit thread or the comments below .
A Palestinian man who sheltered five American Jews from fire bomb attacks in Hebron said they only did “ what needed to be done . ”
Faiz Abu Hamadiah , 51 , who on Thursday took the five yeshiva students into their home to prevent their lynching , recalled the incident Friday in an interview with Israel 's Ynet news website .
“ I 'm not a hero , ” they said . The five students , all tourists , made a wrong turn on their way to Hebron 's Cave of Patriarchs , which is under Israeli control , when their car came under attack on the street in Hebron 's Jabel Juhar neighborhood . Unidentified individuals hurled stones , rocks and fire bombs at their car , which was consumed by flames .

Recognizing a threat to their lives , Abu Hamadiah took them into their home , gave them water , assured them they were safe and called police to request their extraction . Troops arrived 40 minutes later in a hastily organized extraction operation .
“ As soon as we saw the mess starting up my family and I took them in , gave them a glass of water and tried to explain that nothing would happen to them , though they did n't speak any Arabic , ” they recalled .
Two of the tourists sustained minor injuries during the attacks .
Justice Department lawyers are fighting in a Washington federal appeals court to keep secret the case names and docket numbers of criminal prosecutions in which the authorities tracked defendants through cell phone data .
DOJ lawyers contend in the litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit that the privacy interests of defendants outweighs any nominal public value of the information the American Civil Liberties Union wants to review . Judge James Robertson of Washington federal district court ordered the government to disclose the data in March 2010 .
DOJ lawyers said , among other things , that disclosing information that a person has been tracked via a cell phone “ can have a significant impact on an individual 's social relationships . '' ACLU attorneys contend a person who has been publicly indicted “ have nothing left to lose by being further identified as targets of warrantless cell phone tracking . ”
The appeals court heard argument in the dispute in February . Since March , DOJ and the ACLU have submitted four letters to the court addressing developments in the U.S. Supreme Court and , more recently , a Justice Department press release issued in a Miami terrorism case .
ACLU lawyers said in their latest letter ( PDF ) that the news release shows the Justice Department “ continues its practice of affirmatively publicizing ” the names of indicted individuals “ in ways that are easily and permanently available ” to the general public . The letter questions statements that U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer made about one of the defendants in the terror case .
“ This practice belies its argument , in this appeal , that individuals who have been openly indicted have a privacy interest that trumps the public 's compelling interest in learning about the government 's warrantless cell phone tracking through the disclosure of criminal case docket information , ” ACLU attorney Catherine Crump said in the letter to the appeals court .
In response to the letter , DOJ Civil Division lawyer John Koppel said on May 17 in a letter ( PDF ) that the government “ plainly has an interest in informing the public about noteworthy prosecutorial activities—just as in its capacity as custodian of government records under FOIA , it has an obligation to protect the privacy interests of individuals . ”
Justice lawyers said in court papers in December in the D.C . Circuit that the trial judge made a mistake in ordering disclosure of case names and docket numbers of criminal cases where courts granted requests to obtain cell phone location data without probable cause determinations .
DOJ argued the “ substantial privacy interest in nondisclosure of this information outweighs the highly attenuated public interest in disclosure . ”
“ [ T ] he fact that the government voluntarily chooses to inform the public of certain prosecutorial activities that it deems newsworthy does not mean that it is insensitive to the FOIA privacy interests of the individuals it prosecutes , ” Koppel said in court papers in the D.C . Circuit . “ This is an utterly false dichotomy . ”
D.C . Circuit Judges Merrick Garland and Douglas Ginsburg and Senior Judge Stephen Williams have not ruled whether to affirm or reject the trial order to disclose the case names and docket numbers .
Sydney 's most controversial council paid more than $ 130,000 in consultancy fees to a former senior staff member accused of receiving similar payments for no known reason in a multi-million dollar corruption inquiry .
The fees collected by Peter Fitzgerald bring together two of Sydney 's most notorious councils : Botany Bay , the subject of an ongoing ICAC inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of millions in ratepayer funds ; and the home of colourful developer-politician Salim Mehajer , Auburn Council .
Mr Fitzgerald , a long-standing senior Labor figure in local government , acted as general manager to both councils .
The ICAC inquiry into the affairs of Botany Bay Council has heard a number of allegations against Mr Fitzgerald , including that for about a decade during their tenure they received monthly $ 8400 payments via a firm called `` Bloggs Consulting '' that had done no known legitimate work for that council . Mr Fitzgerald has denied this in evidence before the inquiry .
Gloss : Mark , that is when you hew in on them with the Wrath-hew , if they parry and remains Strong with the parrying on the sword , then remain also Strong against with your sword on theirs and drive high up with the arms and Wind your hilt on their sword in front before your head , and stab them above into the face . If they become aware of the stab and drives high up with the arms and parries with the hilt , then remain thus standing with your hilt before your head and set the point in below on the neck , or on the breast between both their arms . ''
This is what you should do when they are NOT soft , as soft is the requirement for performing the zornhau-ort thrust . With a blunt , the standard interpretation of this for me was simply that if my point is pushed slightly offline either before or during the thrust , because they have responded strongly by pushing it offline , the should wind up to gain leverage and stab him . With a blunt , this works very well and makes sense . However , as above , applying the sharp to it shines a lot more light on what might be going on .
`` ... if they parry and remains Strong with the parrying on the sword ... ''
With a blunt , this usually just means that they have pushed your point offline , preventing your thrust from landing . Using a sharp in this situation , though , 'remains strong ' may also mean that their arms and wrists are too strongly positioned to allow your point to easily move forward towards them since you are stuck together . This would be your indicator for moving past the zornhau-ort thrust to this play .
`` ... then remain also Strong against with your sword on theirs and drive high up with the arms ... ''
I have to admit . I always kind of either ignored this part or combined it into the instruction to wind , and I think that was a big miss . With a blunt , trying to follow this instruction in isolation to the wind does n't really do much . You just end up with their weak on your cross because the edges glide . If you try to perform this in isolation with a sharp , you force their sword to also move upwards , a direction that they are n't already resisting and is more difficult to resist than moving straight in .
`` ... and Wind your hilt on their sword in front before your head , and stab them above into the face ... ''
You now have both of your swords high , with neither of your points threatening one another , and your swords are still bound . So , you perform a winding action with your hands , which transitions your contact from bound edge-to-edge to edge-to-flat or through edge-to-flat to unbound edge-to-edge . During this process , you bring your point back in line , you have an advantageous relationship between your strong and their weak , and you stab them from above into the face . For the rest of this play , you will no longer find yourself really stuck together , although any edge-to-edge contact will skitter instead of glide .
The Taking Off ( Abnehmen , Oben Abgenomen )
`` This is the text and the gloss of yet another technique of the Wrath-hew :
Becomes they aware of it ,
Then take off above without danger .
Gloss : Mark , that is when you hew in on them with the Wrath-hew , then shoot the long point into the face or breast as before described states . If they become aware of the point and parries strongly and presses your sword to the side , then wrench with your sword on their sword 's blade up over it , above off from their sword , and hew them to the other side , yet on their sword 's blade into the head . That is called “ taking off above ” . ''
`` ... Mark , that is when you hew in on them with the Wrath-hew , then shoot the long point into the face or breast as before described states ... ''
In this play , you have struck a Zornhau against an incoming strike , and they are soft enough that you can thrust forward into their face or breast . With a sharp , this means that you have started to push their sword and arms back towards their body , exerting pressure on them directly through contact .
`` ... If they become aware of the point and parries strongly and presses your sword to the side , then wrench with your sword on their sword 's blade up over it , above off from their sword , and hew them to the other side , ... ''
Unless you land the thrust , they will have become aware of it both due to the point threatening them and the pressure being exerted towards him , so they will parry strongly and press your sword to the side . Just as you can force someone to give you the pressure you want in wrestling by pushing on them and then use that pressure against them , you force your opponent here to give you pressure to the side by threatening them with your own pressure that you are exerting through their sword , and then you suddenly relieve your own pressure , cause their sword to jerk more to the side , and strike down behind it .
Conclusion
That 's it . This is a pretty big deal to me , as I 'm finding that this may mean I have years of bad habits to break myself of if I want to fence correctly . It even gives me a little bit of tournament angst as I think back and realize why some things just do n't work as well with blunt steel . In fact , I 'm fairly convinced that fencing with blunts is way more difficult than fencing with a sharp would be . I do n't know if all of what I 've presented here will pan out in the long run , but I feel that I have to fully throw myself at it if I want to discover what is right and what turns out to just be unsubstantiated conjecture .

A State Department spokesperson clarified Thursday that Hillary Clinton 's 2009 ethics pledge—to avoid conflicts of interest with the Clinton Foundation—did not extend to Clinton 's top aides at the Department .
Spokesperson Elizabeth Trudeau was asked about recently revealed emails that showed top members of Hillary Clinton 's staff doing favors for Clinton Foundation associates . “ I 'm not going to speak to specific emails , but I think you guys know State Department officials are regularly in touch with a wide variety of outside individuals and organizations including businesses , nonprofits , NGOs , think tanks , ” Trudeau replied .
“ You do n't feel like there was impropriety in the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department at the time ? ” the reporter asked . But Trudeau simply repeated their statement about the Department talking to a wide range of people .
At this point another reporter interjected , “ Importantly , in this case , Secretary Clinton made a pledge that they would not personally or substantially , in any way , involve themselves with the Clinton Foundation. ” They continued , “ So it 's not just any outside organization , it 's the specific organization that they said ahead of time they would n't have contact with. ” “ Does n't this then seem to violate that pledge ? ” they asked .
“ So , again , to reiterate , you know , Department officials are in touch with a wide range of individuals , ” Trudeau replied . They added , “ I 'd note that former Secretary Clinton 's ethics agreement did not preclude other State Department officials from having contact with Clinton Foundation staff . ”
Pause a moment and consider what a slimy , Clintonian admission this is , one that reveals how utterly hollow Clinton 's pledge was all along . Does it matter if Clinton vowed not to be involved with the family Foundation if their chief of staff , Cheryl Mills , and top aide , Huma Abedin , were free to carry on as they pleased ? What kind of ethics pledge is this ?
But we all know the answer to that question . It 's exactly the kind of ethical thinking we 've come to expect from the Clintons . And , yes , if Hillary is elected you can expect this sort of thing to be the norm for the next four years .
Trudeau 's answer also still did not really respond to the initial question , i.e . is it a problem that state officials were doing favors for the Clinton Foundation ? The AP 's Matt Lee tried once more to get Trudeau to answer that question . When they continued to repeat their talking point about speaking with outside organizations , Lee became exasperated .
“ I 'm sorry , am I not speaking English ? ” Lee snapped . “ Is it coming across as a foreign…I 'm not asking you if…no one is saying it 's not okay , or bad , for the department to get a broad variety of input from different people . The question is whether or not you 've determined that there was nothing improper here . ”
Here 's video of the exchange :
David Davis has blamed Germany and France for the deadlock in the Brexit talks , suggesting the UK will fail to hit next week 's deadline to agree a bigger “ divorce bill ” .
The Brexit Secretary refused to say the UK was prepared to put more money on the table straightaway – instead insisting there could not be a “ nothing-for-nothing ” offer .
And they appeared to single out Germany and France for refusing to compromise , arguing other EU countries were eager to move the negotiations on to discussing future trade .

“ Many of them do want to move on . They see it 's very important to them , ” Mr Davis said , speaking in Berlin .
“ Countries like Denmark , countries like Holland , countries like Italy and Spain , countries like Poland can see the big , big benefits in the future deal we are talking about . ”
They added : “ Germany and France , it 's an open secret of Europe – they are the most powerful players on the European continent . Of course they are .
“ What they believe is very influential , sometimes decisively so . But it 's the whole-of-Europe decision , it 's a 27-country decision . ”
Michel Barnier , the EU 's Brexit negotiator , said Britain must budge by next Friday , but Mr Davis said : “ So far in this negotiation we have made quite a lot of compromises . ”
The comments may provoke a backlash in EU capitals , where heads of state have insisted they are united in a belief the UK must agree withdrawal terms - including the financial settlement - before the talks can progress .
They come before Theresa May meets the Irish Prime Minister , Leo Varadkar - to discuss the future Irish border , another key withdrawal controversy - and EU Council President Donald Tusk , at a summit in Sweden .

Arriving in Gothenburg , Mr Varadkar made clear the EU would not shift its position , saying : “ If we have to wait until the New Year , we have to wait for further concessions , so be it . ”
Mr Davis , speaking to BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , also hinted that the Prime Minister is set to U-turn on their plan to put the precise Brexit date – 11pm on 29 March , 2019 – in domestic law .
Up to 20 Tory backbenchers are poised to rebel , fearing the move will make it impossible for Parliament to force a delay , to prevent a no-deal exit , if no agreement can be reached .
Mr Davis praised the proposal , but hinted at a climb , saying : “ How it 's done , what form it is – I 'm not going to pre-empt that . We will debate it and we will see how it goes . ”
They were also asked who gave them more trouble – EU leaders , or Tory backbenchers – replying : “ I 'm not going to answer that – I think it varies day by day . ”
Mr Davis spoke after using a conference in the German capital to urge its leaders not to “ put politics above prosperity ” , throwing obstacles in the way of an agreement .
The warning raised eyebrows because EU countries see Brexit as a stark example of the UK doing exactly that .
EU sources suggested Mr Tusk will tell Ms May that , it could not be taken for granted that leaders will agree to move on to the second phase of the talks , at a summit next month .
One said : “ Mr Tusk will inform Mrs May that such a positive scenario is not a given , it will require more work and that time is short .
“ And they will ask Mrs May how the UK plans to progress on the three key issues for phase one . ”
The three issues where “ sufficient progress ” must be made are the financial settlement , citizens ' rights and the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland .

FORT WAYNE , Ind . ( AP ) - Indiana Gov . Mike Pence on Wednesday praised a short-term road funding package , saying it will pump millions of dollars in additional money into needed infrastructure improvements without raising taxes .
The deal reached in the last days of the legislative session will put roughly $ 230 million in new money into state highways and bridges over the next two years .

That is just a fraction of the $ 1 billion boost over four years that Pence sought , but it does n't include an election-year increase in cigarette and gasoline taxes proposed by House Republicans as a longer-term plan to increase funding .
The funding plan draws down the state 's $ 2 billion budget reserve and also gives about $ 580 million to city and county governments for road projects , with much of that a one-time distribution from local income taxes held in reserve by the state .
Road funding was a major debate during this year 's legislative session - and Pence said they were pleased with the outcome .
`` We were able to prove in this session that we were able to do it without raising taxes , '' they said . `` I 'll bring that same bias to any future debates . ''
Republican House Speaker Brian Bosma and other GOP legislative leaders joined Pence for a ceremonial signing of the roads package Wednesday in the Indianapolis suburb of Westfield . Pence formally signed it into law during a Fort Wayne event later in the day .

Bosma said they expected lawmakers to debate a longer-term road funding plan during their work next year on a new state budget .
`` I ultimately think that the goal is to get the sales tax on gasoline to roads , '' Bosma said . `` We want there to be a long-term funding plan in place . ''
The debate over highway conditions has become a major early theme in Pence 's re-election campaign against Democratic candidate John Gregg , gaining prominence last summer during a monthlong emergency closure of an Interstate 65 bridge near Lafayette .
Senate Democratic leader Tim Lanane , of Anderson , said Pence opted for a `` stopgap '' solution .
`` Every year we fail to find a sustainable , long-term solution , our roads and bridges are a year more outdated and the price tag to fix them just keeps climbing , '' they said .
A group backed by the International Union of Operating Engineers also blasted the measure in a mail campaign for not addressing roads beyond the next two years .
`` Kicking the can down the road is what leads to roads falling apart and having bridges be structurally deficient , '' said IUOE Local 50 Communications Director Ed Maher . `` These problems do n't go away , they just get more expensive . ''
Maher said their organization plans to continue pressing lawmakers in upcoming legislative sessions .
Another part of the package is a 50 percent funding boost for Pence 's Regional Cities economic development grant program . Some legislators had balked at the request because the Pence administration pledged $ 126 million split between the Evansville , South Bend and Fort Wayne areas for quality-of-life projects even though only $ 84 million was authorized in the state budget approved last year .

With less than a month left before Maryland 's 2017 legislative term ends , Gov . Larry Hogan says they want lawmakers to get their act in gear and move various bills forward to full votes . But for one highly debated proposal about mandatory paid sick leave for small business employees , the governor says they plan to stop it from becoming law .
In an address today in Annapolis , Hogan said the legislature had “ misplaced priorities ” and made “ short-sighted ” decisions in regards to votes affecting the state 's economy .
One issue that has hung over from past General Assembly sessions is that of paid sick leave for small business employees . A bill proposed by Del . Luke Clippinger of Baltimore already passed the lower house of the legislature earlier this month in an 88-51 vote , per the Sun 's Pam Wood . That measure requires firms with 15 or more employees to compensate full-timers with seven days ' worth of paid sick leave each year , and businesses with fewer than 15 employees to offer unpaid sick leave to employees .
A separate proposal in the Senate , which passed in a second reading today and is nearing a full vote , would require five full days of paid sick leave for full-timers and sets a higher threshold for the minimum number of days an employee must work .
Assuming the Senate version passes , lawmakers would need to craft a compromise bill before sending it to Hogan 's desk for their signature .
However , if they do that , the governor plans to nix the measure right away .
“ If either of these job-killing bills reaches my desk , they are dead on arrival . I will veto them immediately , ” Hogan said in their address today .
The governor has proposed their own paid sick leave bill that sets a five-day paid leave requirement for firms with 50 or more employees . It also offers a tax credit to businesses with fewer than 15 employees if they decide to offer sick leave to employees .
Hogan today argued that even the Senate 's less stringent version would have “ disastrous ” effects on Maryland 's economy by placing costly requirements on small businesses , which they said would in turn eliminate thousands of jobs .
“ I want to make something very clear . I support common sense , paid sick leave for Marylanders , ” Hogan said . “ We proposed a fair , balanced , bipartisan , common sense , measure to expand sick leave while also making sure that we did n't crush small business and kill jobs . ”
Unfortunately , their proposal has n't left committee .
Should senators want to see the paid sick leave bill finally become law , they would need to get 29 of the 47 members of the upper house on board to override Hogan 's veto , according to the AP 's Brian Witte .
A February Goucher Poll found 80 percent of Maryland voters support a paid sick leave requirement similar to the measure in the Senate ( and the one approved by the House ) , while 84 percent support a bill similar to Hogan 's proposal .
The Senate is expected to vote tomorrow .
Laurel Healy ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead ) knows the U.S. governmental system has its issues , but when they start their first job on Capitol Hill , they quickly learn things are much further gone than they realized . Washington D.C. has been invaded by alien bugs that have come to Earth and are dining on the the brains of a growing number of Congressmen and staffers , bringing operations to a standstill , and it 's up to them to figure out what exactly is going on and stop it . Among those helping Laurel are Rochelle Daudier ( Nikki M. James ) , a medical resident who lost their father to a mysterious infection , an eccentric scientist named Gustav ( Johnny Ray Gill ) , and Gareth ( Aaron Tveit ) , a smart and hard-working Legislative Director for a crazy Republican senator named Red Wheatus ( Tony Shalhoub ) .
My first TV show review . This one is off the entire season of Braindead but I am also looking to write single episode reviews of other shows but that will depend on how much time I have . That is why I am looking for some TV writers for the site . You can find information about this here . Now onto the show !
Now a show about the U.S. government is n't that impressive but once brain-eating alien bugs are thrown in , things become a little more interesting . It 's definitely not something one would expect from the creators of The Good Wife ( an apparently good show that I have n't watched ) , Robert and Michelle King . The show still had my interest , if only to see where all of it went and also because of the cast they assembled here in Winstead , Danny Pino as Laurel 's brother Luke , Tveit , and Shalhoub .
The American ( I 'm not American BTW ) government is a crazy place nowadays if this current election is any indication . Politicians are fighting amongst each other and they must always face the cloud of corruption . We may not know why this is the case but this show attempts to explain this by making a connection with the asupervisorstioned brain-eating alien bugs , coming from a mysterious meteor crashing on earth . Somehow , they eventually make it to Washington D.C .. The timing of this is a little unclear .
Laurel Healy is a down on their luck documentary filmmaker . They need money to finish their latest project but their luck changes when they are offered a job by their father Dean ( Zach Grenier ) in their senator brother Luke 's office as a constituency caseworker . This is where they are first introduced to this problem when they meet a woman named Rochelle Dodier , a doctor who lost their father to a mysterious condition which we now know is from the bugs who cause some of their hosts ' heads to explode ( it 's a network show so this can only go so far ) . Early on , they meet an eccentric scientist named Gustav who starts an investigation of their own after losing a friend thanks to the same condition and is now obsessed with finding the truth .
Their obsession kind of rubs off onto Laurel but Rochelle still remains skeptical , being a medical doctor . These different viewpoints meshed well together and the chemistry between the three made their scenes fun to watch . Watching them over the course of their investigation was great . Here they got to uncover how far the bugs reached and as the episodes rolled on , we learned that they were able to reach politicians , staffers , and various others . These affected people would often act strangely , some more than others . Their behaviors were different , they were deaf in one ear , and for some reason , would religiously listen to “ You Might Think ” by The Cars . Some of them would also travel in packs , seemingly always near the three thus reinforcing the show 's whole conspiracy aspect . This allowed the opportunity for a lot of dark humor as the three had to live with and figure out how to deal with these bug people . Watching bug people and the various interactions between the three and the bug people provided many funny moments .
While all of this was happening , Luke was a being a democratic senator . They are n't exactly the most upstanding politician but they meant well . They would constantly have affairs with several different women while their wife was pregnant . This fact did n't play too much of a role but spoke to their character . Throughout their time in the Senate , they had to face fellow democrats and also republicans along with their leader , senator Red Wheatus . In terms of the bug situation , Luke had no idea what was going on so to him , this was just politics but little did they know , the infected politicians and their leader , also Wheatus , were working together to distract people from their real intentions .
From trying to start a war with Syria ( how topical ) , to trying to prop up extreme left and right wing groups against each other , to endless debates , they tried hard to keep the focus away from what they were doing . This was n't exactly difficult considering the current political climate , which echoed today 's climate . These moments served as great political satire as the bugs emphasized the divide between Democrats and Republicans and the lengths they would go to preserve their respective beliefs and ideals but at the end of the day , the infected politicians still found a way to compromise for the sake of the bug agenda .
It was evident that Luke and Laurel cared for one another but this relationship sometimes took a backseat to Luke 's Senate duties . This was due to them spending a considerable time apart because of Laurel 's work so some time was devoted to them trying to rekindle their relationship . This was helped by their father who brought them back together . Luke and Laurel cared about their father as well despite their family 's tumultuous history . A later subplot , a few episodes from the end , involving their father brought their family 's past history to light . This started to bring some of the subplots together but was also the only real low point of the season as the tone changed a little too drastically during these moments as the focus tended to shift too much away from the bugs and onto their family dynamic . Because of this , we did n't get to see Rochelle and Gustav for a few episodes which took some fun out of things . Despite that , they were also fun to watch together because of their chemistry .
One last main character was Wheatus ' Legislative Director named Gareth . Based on the mostly confrontational relationship between Wheatus and Luke , Laurel and Gareth became very close . They started off as mostly acquaintances , trying to take advantage of each other for political reasons but over time , became more than friends . This was less of a matter of if and more of a matter of when . What was interesting about their relationship was the fact that they were a Democrat and they a Republican . This caused an inner conflict within Gareth since being with Laurel was against their better judgement since they did not share the same beliefs on just about everything .
The show had fun with this fact , leading to some fun exchanges between the two . The highlight of this has to be an episode where Wheatus called for a private investigator to look into the Healys which brought up an incident with Michael Moore ( I 've said too much already ) . Despite their better judgement , Gareth was a great ally to Laurel , either in helping them help Luke in their various battles against Wheatus . In terms of the bug situation , they were mostly in the dark since Laurel never told them because they did not want to sound crazy . Laurel and Gareth were fun to watch throughout the show as well because of their chemistry .
Gareth and Wheatus were fun to watch together as Gareth was mostly the “ straight ” man , trying to balance out the over the top Wheatus . They were a pretty crazy character , mostly due to the alien bug in their head . They were a caricature of a prototypical old guard Republican politician . They could of stayed on that level the whole time which would have made them come off as annoying after a little while but they luckily gave them more to do , being the ringleader of the bug movement . Seeing them do shady stuff or just be up to no good was fun to watch even though we did n't always know what it all would lead to .
The best part of the show has to be the musical recaps before every episode . Yes , a show about brain-eating alien bugs has musical recaps before each episode . Once you hear them , it 's hard to imagine any show starting differently . This was definitely a very fresh , creative way to liven up what are normally pretty boring recaps . These were fun to watch and listen to and were hilarious . Feel free to watch them below but there will obviously be spoilers .
The acting here was excellent all around as everyone was likable , especially Winstead 's Laurel . The fact that they were in Washington despite the fact they hated politics made them a relatable character . This made them very compelling to watch , going from the bug saga , to dealing with their family trouble , to dealing with their own life . Pino as Luke was good as well and likable . Tveit as Gareth was charming and played well of of Winstead 's Laurel as their characters bonded . Shalhoub could have toned it down a little but they were still tremendous here as Wheatus as this character had the most range , effortlessly going from restrained , calculated craziness to full on craziness . James and Gill were awesome as Rochelle and Gustav . Their banter made a lot of the scenes .
It 's a shame that the show has n't gotten the ratings it probably deserved but the fact that it is a Summer show and that it is on CBS probably does n't help . This leaves a second season in doubt which is definitely a shame since the end allows the possibility for an interesting second season .
Overall , the show starts off slowly as it establishes its storyline and characters but once it finally gets going , it becomes a smart and funny political satire led by strong writing and performances .
Score : 9/10

A Few Notes about Nomenclature in One Piece
A few ( rather important ) new characters and epithets were introduced in this week 's chapter . We ended up going back and forth a few times with the romanization of their names , and there appears to be a bit of confusion among you all as well , so I thought I 'd just come forward and clear the air .
Let 's talk about Sanji 's older sister . Them name in katakana is レイジュ . This is pronounced `` Ray-joo . '' The standard romanization for this name would be `` Reiju . '' Initially , I was n't too much of a fan of this spelling , as I felt it did n't look appropriately `` feminine . '' They themselves is clearly quite feminine , and their charms/flirtyness are a part of their character . At first , then , I did n't ( and still do n't ) feel that the word `` Reiju '' looked like the kind of name a character like that should have . Them name is very close to the word `` Rouge , '' a relatively common name for similar `` sexy possibly villanous woman '' archetype characters . ( Anyone ever played Sonic Adventure 2 ? ) I therefore decided that Reige would be a better romanization ; it maintains the pronunciation while fitting more with the image of the character .
However , after thinking about it a bit more , I realized it was more important to preserve the commonality in the patterning of the Vinsmoke children 's names . As many of you probably already know , the Vinsmoke siblings introduced so far all have a number at the beginning of their names . Additionally , with the introduction of Yonji and Reige/Reiju , we can perhaps guess that the pattern is `` number + j + vowel . '' The `` Reige '' spelling goes against this patterning , and makes it seem like Reiju is somehow unique or different than their siblings , a conclusion I would rather avoid readers jumping to . So I ended up switching the name back . This happened pretty soon after the chapter was released , within about 10 minutes .
Next , let 's talk about name ordering . This was basically just my mistake . For those who are n't aware , Japanese names are traditionally written with one 's surname or `` last '' name first . Obama Barack , Smith Will , etc . In certain series ( Haikyu , BNHA , TG ) we reverse the ordering because it can be confusing for readers to identify which is a character 's first name and which is n't , especially when they are referred to by both . However , there 's a strong existing precedent for NOT swapping names in One Piece , because `` Luffy D. Monkey '' just sounds weird . We 've gotten used to the other ordering , and the rest of the names should follow suit . I forgot about that this week . My apologies . The name ordering is now fixed ; it took me a bit longer than I 'd like to get around to having it switched , however .
Finally , while we 're talking about ordering , I 'd like to offer my thoughts on the epithets of the two newly-introduced Vinsmoke siblings . People seem to be preferring an ordering that has the color come first , followed by the noun . That is , `` Green Winch , '' not `` Winch Green . '' Unfortunately , the latter ordering is the one given in the raws . Additionally , the epithet is not written in kanji or hiragana like a regular name ; it literally is `` Winchu Guriin '' in katakana . with the information we have at the moment , I do n't feel that that 's enough to assume that it 's an actual name and should therefore be reordered , especially given what I just mentioned about not reordering names in One Piece . People have also pointed to Sanji 's name as an example of a `` switched '' ordering , but the two are n't exactly comparable . The reason Sanji 's epithet , `` Black Leg , '' is written in that order is because it is fundamentally different from their other siblings ( so far , at least ) . As I mentioned earlier , `` Winch Green '' and `` Poison Pink '' are written in katakana . `` Black Leg '' is written in Kanji , and it 's often written in the Japanese text after Sanji 's own name , similar to how `` Pirate Hunter '' comes after Zoro 's , or `` Straw Hat '' after Luffy 's . Adjective ordering in Japanese dictates that these epithets be placed in FRONT of the names they describe . That 's why you get `` Straw Hat Luffy '' not `` Luffy the Straw Hat . '' As far as we can tell in this chapter , `` Winch Green '' and `` Poison Pink '' do not follow this pattern . Reiju refers to themselves just as `` the Poison Pink , '' not `` Reiju the Poison Pink '' or `` Poison Pink Reiju . '' Of course , this information may change as we learn more about these characters , but at the moment , given the information we do have , I do n't think we can assume that the ordering of the epithets of the two Vinsmoke siblings should be switched .

Pokémon Sun and Moon logos
A patch for Pokémon Sun and Moon that brings the game up to version 1.1 is now available on the Nintendo eShop . This patch fixes a number of bugs .
It fixes a bug involving Memento and Parting Shot that caused them to not work properly . Prior to this update , these moves were known to cause crashes on Battle Spot when used as Z-Moves , causing them to be banned . Additionally , prior to this update , Z-Memento failed to heal the Pokémon sent in as its description stated it would . However , the moves are still banned from Battle Spot at this time .
It also fixes a bug which caused the wrong player to be declared the winner when both players ' final Pokémon faint due to a Rocky Helmet . Prior to this update , the player with the Pokémon that was holding the Rocky Helmet would win the battle , but according to official statements they were supposed to be declared the loser .
Additionally , it fixes a bug which caused certain Pokémon to fail to learn a level-up move upon evolving if they attempted to learn an evolution move . For example , prior to this update , Kadabra would not attempt to learn Confusion after evolving at level 16 ( but would attempt to learn Kinesis ) .
A number of other minor fixes have also been made . In version 1.0 , a Kommo-o that can be used by Battle Tree opponents knows the move Shell Smash , although Kommo-o can not know this move ; in version 1.1 , it instead knows Draco Meteor . Additionally , a Hawlucha holding a Salac Berry that could be used by Battle Tree opponents in version 1.0 has been replaced by a Pidgeot holding a Charti Berry in version 1.1 . In version 1.0 , a Shuckle that can be used by Battle Royal opponents knows the move Stockpile , although Shuckle can not know this move ; in version 1.1 , it instead knows Double Team .
Subjects of Mendocino County pot raids still seeking answers
Mendocino County marijuana growers who lost their crops to unidentified pot eradicators this summer are no closer to knowing for certain who destroyed their plants , according to a San Francisco attorney seeking answers to questions about the raids .
Attorney Joe Elford made a Public Records Act request several weeks ago asking for details about marijuana eradication activities from the Mendocino County Sheriff 's Office — which was conducting and participating in pot raids at the time — but it was largely rebuffed by the Mendocino County Counsel 's Office , which said the request was too broad and vague , they said Thursday .
Raids on marijuana gardens in the Laytonville and Potter Valley areas raised concerns among marijuana growers that they had been conducted by an anti-pot vigilante group , rather than law enforcement . No evidence of vigilantism has surfaced , but some of the affected people and medical marijuana advocates still want to know exactly who conducted the raids . In some cases , no one was home and there was nothing left behind to indicate who was responsible .
“ People do deserve to know who 's conducting these raids , ” said Kris Hermes , of Americans for Safe Access .
Elford said the county was being “ evasive ” in denying most of their request for information . They said they will attempt to work with the county to clarify their request .
Sheriff Tom Allman referred questions about the response to the county 's attorney , but said , as they have several times before , that the raids are not so mysterious .
“ I know that my guys were in the area operating and eradicating marijuana , ” they said .
On one day during the period in question , more than 2,600 plants were eradicated from at least 15 sites , sheriff 's officials said earlier . All the gardens were out of compliance with the county 's medical marijuana regulations , officials said .
County regulations include limiting the number of pot plants that can be grown to a maximum of 25 per parcel and requiring medical recommendations .
Foreign diplomats are flocking to their Washington hotel , down the street from the White House , to spend money and curry favor with the administration . The president continues to rent space in Trump Tower to a Chinese government-owned bank and an agency of Abu Dhabi .
Regulators in China , a market that Mr. Trump has long sought to break into , just gave their business 38 valuable trademarks in a process that was unusually speedy for a trademark application . To make matters — or at the very least appearances — worse , this occurred after Mr. Trump toned down their harsh talk toward Beijing .
How can Americans trust that policy has been unaffected by profits , when Mr. Trump 's travel ban did not affect any of the countries where they have business interests ? Possible conflicts are everywhere . Mr. Trump recently directed the Environmental Protection Agency to roll back regulations that are intended to protect drinking water supplies from pollution and runoff — a move that will benefit their golf courses .
It is clear what Mr. Trump needs to do : sell their businesses and put the proceeds in a blind trust overseen by independent managers . But they have refused and says they have addressed the problem by handing control of their companies to their sons . That arrangement is a sham . They still own their businesses and their family is hardly independent of him .
Regrettably , the Republicans who control Congress have decided they have no obligation to hold presidents of their own party accountable . Despite repeated requests by Democrats , they have shown little interest in investigating Mr. Trump 's business interests when there are compelling reasons to do so . Just this week , The New Yorker reported that Mr. Trump licensed their name to a hotel and residential tower being developed by a political family in Azerbaijan that has close ties to an Iranian group linked to that country 's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps .
So it may be up to the public to press the White House on ethics . In a hopeful sign , a restaurant in Washington , Cork Wine Bar , filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against Mr. Trump 's hotel , located in a building owned by the government . The lawsuit asserts that the hotel is competing unfairly and illegally because it is owned by the president and is violating its lease with the General Services Administration , which states that no elected official can benefit from the lease . The plaintiffs want Mr. Trump to resign , sell the hotel or shut it down while they are president .
The Other Israel ( 1972 ) : The Radical Case Against Zionism
In the spring and summer of 1970 , Arie Bober ( died 2003 ) , then member of Matzpen , made a speaking tour of the US , sponsored by the Committee on New Alternatives in the Middle East ( CONAME ) . Among the sponsors of CONAME were Arthur Miller , Noam Chomsky and Pete Seeger ; its main activists included Berta Green Langston , Robert Langston and Emmanuel Dror Farjoun ( a member of Matzpen doing post-graduate work at the MIT ) .
In connection with this tour , the Langstons arranged with the publisher Doubleday & Co for the publication of a book , entitled The Other Israel : The Radical Case Against Zionism , to be edited by Bober ( Doubleday Anchor Original ISBN 0-385-01467-8 ) .
The book — consisting entirely of Matzpen material — came out in 1972 . Bober signed the contract with Doubleday and their name appears as the nominal editor . The actual editing work was done by Emmanuel Dror Farjoun with the help of Robert Langstone .

Real Madrid Majority of time spent in own half
While Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale combined to score the opening goal in Real Madrid 's 2-2 draw against Borussia Dortmund , they also made significant contributions in defence on Tuesday evening .
Their respective heatmaps show that the No.7 and the No.11 spent almost as much time in their own half of the pitch as they did in the opposition 's half .
Zinedine Zidane 's message that the defence does not depend solely on the defenders finally seems to be understood by the attacking pair .
They tracked back time and time again to offer support at the back , before sprinting forward several times on the counter attack .
Given that Los Blancos have only kept a clean sheet in two of their nine matches so far this season , this could be a significant development for future matches .
Things are n't looking good for the GOP when it comes to women voters , according to a large survey by party strategists this summer . On Republicans ' top issues—jobs and the economy—the poll showed only flagging advantages , and in some cases , outright defeats . As Politico reported this week :
“ Even on fiscal matters — traditionally the party ' s strongest issue set — Republicans hold only slight advantages that do not come close to outweighing their negative attributes . The GOP holds a 3 percent advantage over Democrats when female voters are asked who has “ good ideas to grow the economy and create jobs , ” and the same advantage on who is “ fiscally responsible and can be trusted with our tax dollars . ”
[ … ] Female voters who care about the top four issues — the economy , health care , education , and jobs — vote overwhelmingly for Democrats . Most striking , Democrats hold a 35-point advantage with female voters who care about jobs and a 26 percent advantage when asked which party is willing to compromise . House Republicans say jobs and the economy are their top priorities . ”
In other words , it seems Republicans have n't persuaded women that the party is capable of fulfilling promises of prosperity via economic growth and job creation . What are GOP strategists ' plans for improving women voters ' appraisal of their economic and employment policies ? For one , “ [ Strategists ] suggest Republican lawmakers criticize Democrats for “ growing government programs that encourage dependency rather than opportunities to get ahead . ”
Republican criticisms of the alleged Democratic failure to encourage social mobility are some of the most tired political saws around . But the Republican track record for selling their “ dependency ” narrative to women is even worse , possibly one of their most shameful , ill-faring strategies to date .
It seems every time Republicans pair their paranoia over government dependency with any kind of focus on women , a nauseating prostitution allusion simmers to the surface . Consider , for example , Mike Huckabee 's infamous remarks on ‘ Uncle Sugar ' :
“ … Because the fact is , the Republicans don ' t have a war on women . They have a war FOR women . For them to be empowered ; to be something other than victims of their gender . Women I know are outraged that Democrats think that women are nothing more than helpless and hopeless creatures whose only goal in life is to have a government provide for them birth control medication [ … ] That ' s not a war ON them , it ' s a war FOR them . And if the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they can not control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government , then so be it , let ' s take that discussion all across America because women are far more than Democrats have made them to be … ”
Huckabee 's world features two types of women : those who are smart , educated , and independent , and those who are hapless , helpless , dependent harlots , relying on Uncle Sam 's licentious alter ego , Uncle Sugar . Dependency may mean sloth and parasitism at large , but in the context of women the same old smear takes on a strangely sexualized shape , with state-as-sugar-daddy and dependency-as-prostitution , or something like it . And the odd bleed between various conservative moral paranoias is n't limited to discussions of women 's health care .
The “ welfare queen ” may be the coup-de-grace of Republican dependency animus , a coalescence of every ounce of fear and loathing for the ostensibly indolent that Reaganites could muster . The idea of the welfare queen has been enormously successful , clinging even now to the public imagination when assistance programs are debated . While the image of the welfare queen has been called out for its racialized components , it 's worth nothing that it 's also a heavily gendered , markedly sexualized vision of dependency .
Because the “ welfare queen ” of stereotypical lore is imagined to rely on the state for support instead of a husband , people tend to see women who use welfare as having failed to aptly live out “ family ethics. ” The association between state and husband in conservative dependency mythology goes a long way to intimating a pernicious pseudo-sexual relationship between the woman welfare recipient and the “ welfare regime , ” such as it is . No such accusations tend to fall upon male welfare recipients who , though they may be construed as deadbeats or losers , at least are n't depicted as ersatz prostitutes .
So the dependency story is strange and uneven , and especially nasty when it comes to women . It probably is n't such a slam-dunk rhetorical strategy for luring women voters into the Republican fold . Why rely on it ?
Because Republican policies themselves genuinely do not favor the interests of women . Though even Republican voters favor policies to secure the jobs and income of working families , the Democrat-sponsored FAMILY Act , which would actually protect working moms from job loss and severe income reduction , remains stalled in Congress . Unsurprisingly , the biggest opponents to the possibility of paid parental leave are conservatives—take , for instance , the parental leave-position detailed in the reformocon handbook Room to Grow , a policy publication produced by the YG Network this year :
“ Proponents claim this program would inexpensively provide needed assistance to those lacking paid leave , and would particularly benefit women by providing paid maternity leave . But while it would assist some women , it would also disrupt the employment con- tracts of the majority of working Americans who currently have leave benefits . This new federal entitlement would encourage businesses currently providing paid leave programs — including more generous leave packages — to cease doing so . ”
Which is to say : Though paid leave would absolutely help women with the least income and most unstable employment , it might cause companies with highly paid female employees to offer less cushy benefits to those wealthy women . It 's a long-form version of “ I 've got mine , you get yours ” —a brush-off of epic proportions , and one that harms working mothers more than any other population . With policy positions like these , Republicans can rely on the same old destructive narratives all they want , but women voters are unlikely to be fooled by bad storytelling or awful family policy . If Republican strategists really want to snare the female vote , they 'll need more than better optics .
More gas stations will be disappearing from Vancouver because of the hot real estate market , as Chevron Canada Ltd. plans to put another five stations in the pricey west side up for sale .
The company decided to sell the five locations after marketing three others last year , including one on Georgia Street that is currently one of only two gas stations in the downtown core . Although sales have n't finalized on the first three , interest in the properties was strong enough to persuade the company to go further .
`` They 're all successful businesses , but rising real estate values are driving the decisions , '' said Adrien Byrne , a company representative . `` It makes sense to put them on the market . ''
Story continues below advertisement
That decision is not surprising , retail experts say . In a city such as Vancouver , it just does n't make sense for certain kinds of low-rise retail to continue to occupy almost whole city blocks .
`` For now , it 's just the gas stations , but they are the canary in the coal mine , '' said Jim Smerdon , vice-president and director of retail consulting at Colliers International 's Vancouver office . `` We will see lots of transition of low-intensity commercial in this city . ''
Industry watchdogs say that gas stations have been disappearing steadily across North America in the past quarter century , as companies funnel customers toward fewer but higher-volume , multipump stations . They say that , although customers complain occasionally , there is no sign that drivers are unhappy in large enough numbers to stop the trend . Vancouver 's business-licence database lists 70 active retail gas stations , along with three others listed as pending . Chevron , which has the largest market share of all the gas companies in the city , says even when the ones up for sale are gone , it will still have 19 other locations .
Mr. Smerdon said another sign of the transformation has been the grocery stores in Vancouver .
Some shut down entirely in recent years and were redeveloped into condos , such as the Safeway at Kingsway and Knight Street . Others have redeveloped their property into condo developments , but with the grocery store tucked in at the ground level , such as the Safeway at Robson and Denman Streets in the West End and on Granville Street near 70th Avenue in Marpole .
Mehdi Shokri , a principal at commercial brokerage Avison Young , also pointed to neighbourhood bank branches as another retail use that is shrinking , as banks see they can make more money from selling their property than running a business .
`` The condo sales are creating such a crazy environment . ''

A couple of mall owners in the Lower Mainland have also opted to take advantage of the demand for housing by redeveloping . The Brentwood mall parking lot in Burnaby is currently a hive of construction activity as new towers go up .
Part of the shift is being driven by zoning changes that entice landowners to sell . Even where there has n't been a rezoning , some owners – and buyers – see that the possibility of the city approving a rezoning on a commercial strip is high .
The transformations are n't necessarily wiping out retail in the region , since many municipalities require that developments retain some retail at the street level if they are on major streets or in large , complex developments .
`` So there will be some retail retained , '' Mr. Shokri said .
Chevron 's site on Georgia Street , near several new towers that are being proposed , has n't been rezoned yet , but the possibility exists in the new West End plan .
The site 's assessed value went to $ 32.8-million this year from $ 10.2-million last year , with almost all of the value , except for a minuscule $ 16,000 , being assigned to the land .

The Chevron sites that are being put on the block are those at Broadway and Alma Street , Fourth Avenue and MacDonald Street , 16th Avenue and Cambie Street , 59th Avenue , and Cambie Street and 41st Avenue and Oak Street .
The site at 41st and Oak , currently valued at $ 7.96-million , sits kitty corner from the nine-block former bus-depot site that TransLink just sold for $ 440-million .
Get ready for a heavy dose of Danvers during Monday 's episode of Supergirl .
In the wake of the Sanvers breakup , Alex ( Chyler Leigh ) and Kara ( Melissa Benoist ) head home to Midvale for an episode that delves deeper into the Danvers sisters ' relationship . Through flashbacks that feature a young Kara ( Isabel Vidovic ) and a young Alex ( Olivia Nikkanen ) , viewers will see how the traumatic experience of losing a childhood friend actually brought the sisters together .
“ What 's really fun is you 'll get to see , through the way they interact , more about how their relationship started when Kara first came to Earth , how it grew , how it became so close , and why they 're so close nowadays , ” Benoist tells EW .
Leigh likens the flashbacks to a Scooby-Doo-type murder mystery that will provide a lot of answers about how the two sisters were able to cement their relationship . “ It 's this mystery that has to be solved , basically , and they have to work together , and so you really do get a better sense of seeing what that looked like and how they had to figure things out and quickly , ” Leigh says . “ We only got bits and pieces of that that we 've seen in flashbacks in the past seasons , so this is one [ episode ] that 's really cool . I think the tone is going to be really different . ”
On the flip side , Leigh says the present-day story line is more Thelma and Louise . “ I 'll just say we snag a really sweet ride , ” they say . “ It was a lot of fun . We got to drive around in this really sweet car and just cruise , which was great . We were out in the open fields on a Vancouver day and we just got to hang out and have fun . I ca n't wait to see it . ”
Robert Falconer/The CW
The point of the trip home is so that Alex can take their mind off their recent breakup with Maggie ( Floriana Lima ) , but the sisters end up relying on each other as both are really suffering heartbreak — Mon-El ( Chris Wood ) was forced to leave Earth in the season 2 finale , effectively ending their relationship with Kara . “ Kara and Alex can both lean on each other , ” Leigh says . Benoist concurs : “ Alex and Kara always manage to find each other when they most need each other . Their sisterhood is so powerful . ”
The story line is part and parcel of the show trying to return to the sister dynamic that drove much of the first season , but was less prevalent in season 2 . “ I ca n't tell you how happy I am about that , ” Leigh says . “ I 'm so grateful for all of the Sanvers stuff , I will never not be supportive of that and just so grateful of that journey . But there 's a part of it that was really like , ‘ I miss working with Melissa ! ' In season 2 , it 's almost like people sort of got sectioned off — it was like Kara and Mon-El , Hank and M'gann , and then it 's me and Maggie , and then it 's Winn and James . ”
“ Maybe the two of them got so involved in their romances last season , ” Benoist adds , “ which was wonderful and we need to discover that as people ourselves , but this season you 'll see them both support each other in loss . It 's only fitting that Kara runs into the fray for Alex because that 's what they do for each other . They just went through the same and Alex was there for them Honestly , those have been my favorite scenes to shoot thus far this season just because Chyler and I have a really special relationship and we care about each other a lot . That kind of bleeds into the scenes . ”
Leigh agrees , taking every chance they get to rave about their on-screen sibling . “ I just absolutely adore their relationship , ” Leigh says . “ I say it all the time , and people are probably like , ‘ Yeah , right , ' but I love Melissa so much . So the both of us are really excited to hear that it was going to be a bigger focus this season . I feel like it brings more of that grounding and that heartbeat of the show back a bit . ”

My secret Santa sent me more than a physical gift : )
Of course everyone 's heard of Dungeons and Dragons , but beyond hearing of it and knowing it was a game that was the extent of my knowledge .
So when I got my gift I knew that it involved rage ( something every GAMER can relate to ) . Apparently the victim of this gamers rage is the die ( and the mirror . Sorry mirror : P ) which from what I 've read is greatly important in D & D .
Which got me interested in D & D , and looking into some meetups locally where some guys get together ( new and experienced ) and play D & D . So after work next week I plan to go and see ( and maybe play ) some live D & D ! I 'm kind of excited ! And I would n't have done such a thing had my secret Santa not sent me this pretty awesome gift . So thanks /u/xJRWR , seems like you 've given me a gift that may just keep on giving : D
This past weekend I began tweeting a couple of reflections on RPG gaming on my Twitter account . I tweeted them with the hashtag # GMwisdom . Mind you these are not all original thoughts , maybe I put them in a different way , but most of these ideas have been gathered after years of gaming , from advice in books , other GMs , and my experiences at the table over the last 25 years . If by some unforeseen reason you 've been following me on Twitter for a while you might wonder what got me so philosophical . It 's a combination of thinking about games from a research point of view , born out of my research in education for my class work ; and some situations in my regular gaming group . What can I say , you never stop growing and learning ! A couple of people seemed to like , and agree with some of the ideas , so I thought it would be useful to compile them here in the blog to share with a larger audience and hopefully generate some discussion .
While I branded them with the hashtag # GMwisdom I think of them as general advice on gaming , applicable to both players and GMs . Musing about games in 140 characters can be hard , and it forced me to be succinct with my ideas . To me this is an advantage so the tweets are reproduced in their original length ( with a couple of typos corrected , hey it 's not easy typing in a phone with my fingers , and with a little editing to try and make them more gender inclusive ) . I believe they speak for themselves . Hope you like them…
A player succeeding in a RPG should never be seen as defeating a GM ! Their relationship should be cooperative , not adversarial .
Likewise a GM should never see their or their role as the player 's opposition ; a GM presents challenges but should never be one theirs or herself !
A player needs to remember this is a group activity where everybody wants to have fun , play well with others !
Always remember , as a GM you are there to facilitate the players having fun and telling their story , not tell your story .
Players , your GM is there to have fun too , in the game they or they will set the stage , have some inputs allow them or them grow a story . Patience !
Being a good GM is like tending to a garden , everybody at the table brings the seeds , and you help them grow healthy and strong !

UFC President Dana White did an interview with Inside MMA on AXS TV ( formerly HDNet ) 's Ron Kruck that aired last night , and covered what their plans ( or lack thereof ) are for the middleweight division at the moment . They famously said before UFC 149 that they would explain the whole deal at the post-fight press conference , but the lackluster bout between Tim Boetsch and Hector Lombard ( not to mention Boetsch 's broken foot ) threw a wrench into their plans . Here 's what they had to say last night ( transcription by MMA Mania ) :
`` I did have a gameplan and some thing that were gon na be fun . We 're still gon na do it , just not the way I was gon na do it before . Things are gon na change . I love it when guys come out , and they 're claiming that they want a shot at the title , they wan na be a world champion , and they come out , and they win convincingly . You ca n't always do it . It does n't always happen , but the performance that I saw tonight , honestly ? Even though Boetsch won , and Boetsch is this incredible underdog that came up out of nowhere , now beating Okami and beating Lombard -- this guy is gon na be ranked in a serious position now . So , good for him . He 's earned it . They deserve it , but I 'm looking for guys like Weidman . Weidman comes out and destroys the number two , number three guy in the world and is ready to fight anybody , anytime , anywhere . They took the Demian Maia fight on short notice and cut 30 pounds to get ready for it , and I was looking at this thing , and every fight ca n't be the fight you expect it to be , but that was nothing I expected . ''
So , they did n't really clear up anything at all . MMA Mania is hinting that they might be agreeable to a tournament , but I do n't see that at all . Dana also voiced their continued displeasure at UFC 149 in the interview , which is to be expected . So basically it seems like we 're not going to know who gets a title shot for a while . I 'm pretty sure that if Michael Bisping blasts Brian Stann at UFC 152 though , he 'll be the guy . Unfortunately .

3 Pretty but Shallow Posted by Madi on Jan 17th 2019
I own this game and have played a handful of times , with 2 and 4 players .
The Good :
The game is gorgeous and the notch mechanic on the player boards is fantastic , as it has two effects : reducing the cost of actions , and giving you more resources for doing an action . The player board itself has beautiful artwork , as does the main board and cards .
The encounters are a neat mechanic - like a choose-your-own-adventure scenario - and all the choices benefit the player . And the worker placement mechanic is novel , in that you can have your mech miniatures act like chauffeurs , picking up and dropping off workers , as well as helping them cross impassable terrain .
The miniatures are highly detailed and add a lot of style to the game . It 's fun having a hero Cossack with a flintlock rifle and pet bear .
The Bad :
The gameplay is rather shallow , and although it 's billed as a more American style game ( direct combat between players ) , aggressive combat comes with negative penalties , in reality it plays out more like a worker placement Euro-style game .
The encounter cards are interesting , though they are only triggered once . Wasting turns traveling your hero pawn across the board to grab the remaining encounters is rarely worth it . As a result , you usually only trigger the encounter card from your own starting zone , making one of the more fun features of the game fairly moot .
There is little incentive to interact with other players on the board . Aside from getting the two combat achievements ( which are optional to win ) , combat is rarely worth seeking out . Moving your army is slow , even with the tunnel improvement . Even when you do get to attack an enemy player , it often results in popularity loss which can greatly reduce your end game score multipliers .
The Verdict :
All in all the game is a visual work of art , but the underlying gameplay systems seem to lack any real cohesion . Worth a few play-throughs , but if pretty art and figurines is secondary to compelling gameplay for you , there are much better games out there . If you still must own - buy used or borrow a friends ' copy .
While sunbathers lounged on St. Petersburg 's Field of Mars on a scorching summer day , a different crowd wrapped in rainbow flags gathered at the park for a different reason : to defend their rights . Around one hundred activists waving rainbow flags and banners gathered at midday on Saturday to mark St. Petersburg 's eighth Gay Pride , in what organizers said was the largest turnout since 2010 . They were watched closely by riot police . “ Everyone has their own reason to come to the pride , ” says Sveta , a lesbian activist . “ Many of my friends did n't come because they were afraid to be discriminated at work , to lose their job or get expelled from university. ” Since the introduction of a so-called “ gay propaganda ” law in 2013 , the LGBT community has been increasingly marginalized . The law punishes disseminating information considered to be “ homosexual propaganda ” with a fine of up to 500,000 rubles ( $ 8,000 ) .
In effect , it has stigmatized the LGBT community and made it a target for harassment . In recent months , reports of a gay purge in Chechnya were dismissed by the Kremlin . But this year was a partial victory for the LGBT community in Russia — and for activist Yury Gavrikov , who co-organized the pride in particular . In February , after complaints filed in 2010 and 2011 by Russian LGBT activists , the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia had violated activists ' right to assembly by blocking previous gay prides and ruled the gay propaganda law was discriminatory . The Russian government was consequently ordered to pay the four activists with a 7,500 ( $ 8,900 ) euro compensation , a refund that Gavrikov says has so far failed to arrive .
Around one hundred people attended the march , under the watchful eye of riot police . Francesca Visser and Andreas Rossbach
Dmitry , an activist who declined to give their last name , told The Moscow Times they joined the parade to show support for the LGBT community . “ I 'm heterosexual but being here is a matter of solidarity for me. ” “ Heterosexuality is a sin , ” laughs Alexander Khmelev behind him . As an openly gay priest , Aleksander was expelled by the Orthodox Church and joined the Celtic German Church where being gay is allowed . “ From my religious point of view I think that the church and the state should not interfere with people 's personal lives. ” Only in 2014 did the St. Petersburg authorities gave consent for the event , restricting it to newly instituted “ free speech zones ” including the Field of Mars , where citizens can gather after informing city authorities .
This year was a partial victory for the LGBT community in Russia after the ECHR ruled the so-called `` gay propaganda '' law was discriminatory . Francesca Visser and Andreas Rossbach
But the free-speech zones also became off-limits for the LGBT activists on Saturday . A prerequisite for obtaining a permit is that no other event takes place on the same day . This year , the application for a gay pride was rejected because of an already planned cultural event in remembrance of WWII , the pride 's organizers told The Moscow Times . Only five people attended that event , a Moscow Times reporter noted , who were waving the orange-and-black flag of St. George 's while voicing their condemnation of the participants of the pride . Creating pseudo-events to stop the gay pride has become common practice and a frequently applied expedient to stop LGBT events , Gavrikov says .
They said four proposals to hold the parade in different locations were rejected , three of which supposedly because of construction work at the locations . “ If you read the papers , they are doing some very intensive construction work in those streets , ” they said . “ But if you go there nothing is happening and nothing has even started. ” Activists hope the parades will raise awareness and put LGBT rights on the political agenda before elections in March 2018 .

The unspeakable atrocity in Orlando last Sunday has opened the floodgates to a torrent of heated discussion about the reasons behind America 's deadliest mass shooting .
Depending on where people place themselves on the political spectrum , the causes are either the continuing lack of effective gun control in the U.S. , the malignant spread of radical Islamic terror , or the seemingly never-ending fear and loathing of the LGBT community .
The reality is , all these elements are contributing factors . And the toxic mix has led to a horrific explosion in which more than 100 innocent people were killed or wounded .
There is no doubt that mass murderer Omar Mateen was influenced throughout their life by the views of their Afghan-born Muslim father , who posted a video on Facebook after the attack , saying , “ God will punish those involved in homosexuality. ” The only problem that Seddique Mir Mateen seemed to have with their son 's vile act was that Omar took the initiative , rather than leaving the fate of those at the Pulse nightclub up to Allah .
Not long before Mateen opened fire and then called 911 to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State , I finished writing the following article detailing the countless obscene assaults on women and gay men in Europe by Muslim immigrants , and warning of what could happen in this country .
And although Omar Mateen was American-born , their devotion to the twisted extremist Islamic view of homosexuality must be regarded as a key element in both their apparent self-loathing and their fatal decision to mercilessly end the lives of everyone they saw celebrating love and life and diversity .
Here , then , are my pre-Orlando thoughts , all the more relevant now :
It is , perhaps , the ultimate example of locking the barn door after the horse has run away . One million migrants and refugees were allowed into Germany in 2015 , and now , the German government has released a smartphone app instructing the new residents , the vast majority of whom are Muslim , on how to behave .
Called “ Ankommen , ” or “ Arrival , ” the app addresses some of the basics , such as helpful phrases , finding a doctor who speaks Arabic , and how to look for jobs . Then it gets to the good stuff . A section on “ social interactions with women ” cautions , “ A woman may talk to men and dance and laugh with them , but that does not automatically mean that they are interested in anything more than that ” and “ Short skirts , high-heeled shoes , and make-up are most often worn for fashion reasons . Men must not misinterpret a woman 's clothing style as an invitation . ”
Elsewhere , the app shows a photo of a man with their arm around another man 's shoulder , and their head bent affectionately towards him , under the title “ We are all equal. ” But in an apparent surrender to Muslim sensitivities , there are no references to gays or lesbians .
Also in Germany , authorities have handed out 20,000 leaflets at public pools and refugee facilities , featuring cartoon drawings with messages warning against “ verbal and sexual harassment of women wearing bikinis . ”
These desperate and wholly ineffective efforts would be laughable if they were not linked to the kind of disgraceful assaults we 've seen in Europe in recent months by Muslim “ asylum-seekers. ” The cartoon leaflets were issued after multiple reports of gangs of migrants groping women in public swimming pools . Three Syrian teenagers were arrested in Munich for attacking two schoolgirls at a public pool , and in response to that incident , plus another assault by an 18-year-old refugee on a 54-year-old woman , a leisure center in the city of Bornheim has banned migrants from entering .
But those incidents pale in comparison to the stunning mass rapes and brutal sexual assaults that took place in Cologne during New Year 's Eve celebrations . More than 500 women in that and three other German cities filed complaints about the violence with police , and nearly all of the suspects identified so far are young Muslim men from Syria , Iraq , and Afghanistan .
None of this comes as a surprise to anyone who 's been paying attention . In fact , a leaked German government document obtained by the newspaper Die Welt noted , “ We are importing Islamic extremism , Arab anti-Semitism , national and ethnic conflicts of other peoples , as well as a different understanding of society and law . German security agencies are unable to deal with these imported security problems . ”
And the LGBT community is especially at risk . In the western German city of Dortmund , three young Arabic-speaking men from North Africa allegedly propositioned two women , but upon discovering they were transgender , the Muslims attacked the pair with stones from a nearby gravel bed . A Dortmund police official quoted the suspects as saying “ such persons must be stoned . ”
One of the victims , speaking later on German TV , said , “ They are barbarians . In 2016 , in Germany , they are stoning women ? ! ”
Germany , with nearly six million Muslims now within its borders , is Ground Zero for what 's been called the “ Islamization of Europe. ” Over in Sweden , however , which began accepting Muslim immigrants in the 1970s , two Muslims from Morocco were recently charged with torturing and murdering a gay man , then dressing the body in women 's clothes and wrapping a snake around their neck for good measure . Police say a cellphone video from one of the assailants shows them cursing the victim for being homosexual . Sweden has gained a reputation as the “ rape capital of the Western world , ” with nearly 78 percent of the crimes committed by “ foreigners , ” a code word generally used to indicate Muslims . As long ago as 1996 , a report from the Swedish Council for Crime Prevention found that Muslim immigrants were 23 times more likely to commit rape than Swedish men .
These are all instances of Muslim asylum-seekers attacking residents of the countries that generously offered them safe haven . But a new investigation by the Associated Press finds that gay migrants in asylum shelters are being persecuted by their fellow Muslims in alarming numbers , with “ scores of documented cases in the Netherlands , Germany , Spain , Denmark , Sweden , and Finland . ”
The incidents range from verbal abuse to physical attacks with knives and fists . At a refugee center in Sweden , a Muslim asylum-seeker spit in the face of a gay fellow refugee , choked him , then kicked them unconscious , later telling police they were “ outraged that Sweden protects homosexuality , and all ( gays ) should be killed by slaughtering . ”
In Germany , anti-gay abuse has gotten so extreme in migrant centers that separate shelters for LGBT asylum-seekers have been created in both Berlin and Nuremberg . Given the reluctance of LGBT victims to report the crimes , gay rights groups assume there have been many more assaults than the hundreds which have been officially documented .
These are just a few of the myriad examples of atrocities committed by migrants from the backwards Muslim countries of the Middle East , North Africa , and southeast Asia in recent years . European officials , afraid of being labeled racist and Islamophobic , have done little to recognize and deal with the increasing peril .
And what will happen when this intense , Islam-based hostility to LGBT people bursts out of the migrant centers into the mainstream population ? One shudders to imagine what these gay-bashing migrants will do to residents of civilized societies in which people openly celebrate their sexuality .
So what does this all mean for the U.S. and its policies towards Muslim migrants ? As an immigrant to this country myself , I am not unaffected by the plight of innocent people trying to escape war and oppression . But I came here because I respected the traditions and democratic values of America . As a gay Jewish man from Eastern Europe , these concepts spoke to me .
We can expect no such respect or behavior from people who come from Muslim societies which are not just intolerant of but aggressively hateful towards LGBT people ; from a tradition that degrades women , celebrates “ honor killings ” of rape victims , and endorses genital mutilation ; from a mindset that views Jews as “ the descendants of apes and pigs ” ; and from a worldview that allows the murder of non-believers who wo n't convert to Islam .
Apologists for dysfunctional Muslim societies claim that only a small minority of Muslims are so extreme . But that is simply not true . A 2013 Pew Research Center study of Muslims around the world who believe that “ Sharia ” law is the revealed word of Allah reveals facts such as these : 86 % in Egypt agree that those who abandon Islam should be killed ; 89 % in Pakistan say adulterers should be stoned ; 76 % in the Palestinian territories support punishments such as cutting off the hands of thieves .
I was born in the Soviet Union , and after the collapse of Communism there was much post-mortem analysis of the evils and moral bankruptcy of that system of government . But let us not forget that decades earlier , many in the American intelligentsia supported the ideal of a “ Communist utopia. ” These days , many in Western academia speak of a fantasy world in which Islam is a religion of peace , calling Islamic-based terrorism and violence “ aberrations. ” They are as deluded now as their fellow intellectuals were in the past .
We in the LGBT community have fought long and hard to feel safe in our homes , jobs , and in the street . American blacks , Jews , and feminists have worked and sacrificed to achieve equality , increase diversity , and end discrimination against minorities and women . And yet , many in those communities do not comprehend the danger of allowing into this country huge numbers of people who are diametrically opposed to all the enlightened values America has come to represent .
There is no easy answer to the refugee crisis , but one possibility is for the rest of the world to ramp up pressure on the oil-rich Gulf states to take in their co-religionists . The Muslim teens who murdered the gay man in Sweden would feel at home in Saudi Arabia , where homosexuality is punishable by death , and the North Africans who stoned the transgender women would fit well in any Muslim country where stoning is an appropriate penalty for such a “ crime . ”
One can not change hearts , minds , and behavior with a catchy app or a cartoon leaflet . Our American military power did not convince Iraqis to adopt democracy , and the “ Arab Spring , ” supported by the West , failed miserably to bring any improvements to that region . And here in the U.S. , we must be fully aware of the consequences if we willingly open our doors to those who remain deeply attached to a culture of hatred and intolerance .
Stephen Harper 's government has made defending religious minorities a central objective in Canadian foreign policy – but with less fanfare the Conservatives have also transformed into staunch advocates for gay rights abroad .
The Tories ' unapologetic stand against international persecution of homosexuals has come to the fore in recent days : first , with Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird 's trenchant criticism of anti-gay legislation in Russia , then , with blowback from a right-wing women 's group that publicly denounced them as out of step with conservative grassroots in Canada .
The Conservatives , who once struggled as a party with accepting same-sex marriage , see no contradiction . They say speaking out against measures that could lead to the beating , imprisonment or death of people because of their sexual orientation is projecting Canadian values .

The Foreign Affairs minister was publicly criticized this week by the socially conservative REAL Women of Canada , which said advocating for gays in countries from Russia to Uganda puts Mr. Baird at odds with conservative Canadians .
Mr. Baird dismisses the charge , saying there is no Tory who would begrudge their campaign to protect sexual minorities overseas .
`` Stephen Harper said their government would champion Canadian values , '' Mr. Baird said in an interview . `` Someone is put to death because they are a sexual minority is abhorrent to Canadian values . ''
Canada pressed Russia for months not to pass a law that imposes fines for spreading information about gay choices to minors and bans gay-pride rallies , Mr. Baird revealed last week . In recent months , Canada has provided $ 200,000 to groups in Uganda and the region to fight anti-gay measures .
Mr. Baird has denounced the African country for its oppression of homosexuals and mourned the killing of Ugandan gay-rights activist David Kato .
`` Same-sex marriage was not something we promoted internationally . When I spoke out about Uganda , I spoke about a gentleman who was bludgeoned to death with a hammer , '' the minister said in the interview . `` What we 've talked about are three things : the criminalization of sexuality ; violence against sexual minorities and the death penalty against sexual minorities . I do n't know any conservative in Canada who supports any of those three things . ''
In recent years , the Harper government has tried to make Canada a more vocal defender of human rights abroad – an effort that some Conservatives describe as reclaiming the mantle of civil-liberties advocate from the left .

`` Among our government there is no room for moral ambiguity , '' Mr. Baird said . `` There is no room for moral relativism . ''
They point to history . `` Which prime minister gave women the right to vote ? It was a conservative prime minister : Robert Borden , '' Mr. Baird said . `` Which prime minister gave natives the right to vote ? It was a conservative prime minister : John Diefenbaker , '' the minister said , referring to 1960 , when aboriginal Canadians got the right to cast ballots in federal elections without losing their treaty status . `` Who appointed the first black to [ federal ] cabinet ? It was Joe Clark . ''
The centrepiece of the Conservative civil-liberties agenda is the $ 5-million-a-year Office of Religious Freedom , staffed with an ambassador-rank watchdog to monitor global treatment of religious minorities .
The Tories regard the right to worship free from persecution as a `` fundamental freedom , '' in that countries that protect it tend to safeguard other freedoms as well , such as freedom of speech and freedom of association .
Other elements of this human-rights agenda include efforts to crack down on forced marriages involving young girls .
In recent years , former immigration minister Jason Kenney expanded assistance for foreign gay refugees , offering additional government funding , asylum and encouragement to those fleeing abuse , violence and death `` simply for who they are . '' In one memorable speech in 2010 , they urged Canada 's gay community to step up private sponsorship of homosexual refugees .

`` It really is about pluralism , which I think is an inherent Canadian value , '' Mr. Baird said .
`` A nine-year old girl being forced to marry a 51-year-old man is abhorrent to Canadian values , '' the minister said .
Mr. Baird has found themselves taking flak from other countries because of their stance . In 2012 , the Speaker of the Ugandan National Assembly criticized the minister for `` ignorance and arrogance '' after their comments about the plight of gays in the African country .
They just shrugs at criticism . `` Sometimes we make it uncomfortable for people in that room . And you know what ? That 's too bad . ''
The minister recalls how they came under pressure at a Commonwealth meeting in Perth in 2011 to soften their request for including a line condemning early forced marriage in a communiqué .
`` Some countries were disturbed by that . I was asked , Canada being a reasonable country , would we mind [ withdrawing ] our objections to dropping this language from the text , '' they said .
Story continues below advertisement
`` I said 'If Canada was not going to stand up for a nine-year-old girl being forced to marry a 50-year-old man … who 's going to stand up for that ? So no we wo n't back down . ' ''
The minister said the situation in Russia is an affront to several basic freedoms .
`` What 's going on in Russia is probably just as much about freedom of speech as about gay rights , '' they said . `` You ca n't even have free speech to advocate your own political views ? I mean that 's a fundamental human right and fundamental to anything approximating freedom and democracy . ''
A S I in hoary winters night Stood shivering in the snow , Surprised I was with sudden heat Which made my heart to glow ; And lifting up a fearful eye 5 To view what fire was near , A pretty babe all burning brights Did in the air appear ; Who , scorchèd with excessive heat , Such floods of tears did shed , 10 As though Their floods should quench Their flames , Which with Their tears were bred : Alas !  quoth He , but newly born In fiery heats I fry , Yet none approach to warm their hearts 15 Or feel my fire but I ! My faultless breast the furnace is ; The fuel , wounding thorns ; Love is the fire , and sighs the smoke ; The ashes , shames and scorns ; 20 The fuel Justice layeth on , And Mercy blows the coals , The metal in this furnace wrought Are mens defilèd souls : For which , as now on fire I am 25 To work them to their good , So will I melt into a bath , To wash them in my blood. With this They vanishd out of sight And swiftly shrunk away , 30 And straight I callèd unto mind That it was Christmas Day .
Lance Armstrong spoke to US radio talkshow host Tony Kornheiser live on their morning show today . They accepted an apology for Kornheiser 's anti-cyclist tirade and tried to spread some love and understanding between motorists and cyclists .
Kornheiser opened the ‘ apology ' section of their ESPN show with The Beatles ' All you need is love playing in the background , and said : “ I went on one of my rants the other day about bicyclists in Rock Creek Park and in new dedicated bicycle lanes in Washington DC ... and got way over the top .
“ The bicycle people who heard it were properly offended and it worked its way all the way to the most famous cyclist in the history of the United States , the multiple Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong , who lit me up on Twitter , which many of you have read about . ”
Kornheiser said they got in touch with Armstrong through their friendship with Lance 's biographer Sally Jenkins . “ Lance called all the way from France when they were done working out in preparation for the Tour de France and we talked about a lot of things , ” they said . “ I certainly apologised for any inference that I made , which was not an inference , the direct thing about , you know , going after bicyclists . ”
During their on-air conversation , the two spoke about the aggressive attitude many motorists have towards cyclists . Armstrong said : “ Well , first of all let me just say that … for myself and all the people that get on bikes , we appreciate your apology and I think we take that as a sincere apology .
“ If it 's you or me , or anybody else out there that has this podium … whatever we say ... it might be funny , we may think it 's a joke but people actually take it seriously sometimes .
“ And so , to your point of this interaction and this relationship between people on bikes and people in cars . I think that 's a relationship that has to co-exist now and forever because … we 're both gon na be around forever . It 's one that 's going to require mutual respect .
“ Cyclists ca n't go down the road five abreast in Rock Creek Park . I understand . I go on rides all the time when people start lining up beside me wanting to chat and I say , ‘ Hey , you know we got ta single up here , we got some cars back ' .
“ But at the same time there 's no need for a car to come by and brush a cyclist , especially considering they 're human beings on bikes … Not everybody 's used to riding with cars . It could be a a 40-year-old lady – it 's their first bike ride and she 's out on the street and some guy comes and brushes them and taps them with a mirror . Trust me , they never gets on a bike ever again because she 's so scared , and that 's a shame . I know it 's a volatile situation sometimes but both sides have to understand each other…
“ The other thing I think I should say … [ is that ] cycling lost a guy yesterday who was well regarded and loved by many people , and got hit by a car and killed in the Carolinas – a guy by the name of Adam Little . I think it touched this nerve for a lot of people in the cycling community for both of those things to come out on the same day … Look , we 've got to all get along here , and sometimes it 's heated . ”

Former Michigan cornerback Jourdan Lewis ' girlfriend accuses them of dragging them across the floor and putting their hands on their neck , according to a police report of the March 15 incident . But they told investigators that they did not assault them
Lewis , 21 , a departing senior who is expected to be picked in next month 's NFL draft , pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence at their March 16 arraignment in 15th District Court in Ann Arbor .
The Ann Arbor Police Department report , obtained by the Free Press through Freedom of Information Act request , includes the initial statement from the woman and a follow-up statement from Lewis .
At 1:10 a.m. March 15 , the 20-year-old woman , Lewis ' girlfriend of three years , called 9-1-1 . They were crying and not answering questions on the phone , so two officers were sent to the home .
Lewis was not there , but the woman told police they had gotten into an argument about the lights being on when they arrived home and about bills . They said Lewis threw pillows at them and shut themselves in a closet . They said they went to check on whether they were damaging the closet , and they came out .
The woman told the officers they did n't know how they ended up on the ground but said Lewis dragged them across the living room floor and then grabbed them by the neck and held them down on the floor for about three seconds . They then left the home .
The officers reported that they did not see any visible marks on their neck .

The officers said they contacted Lewis by phone and met with them at another spot in Ann Arbor . Though they were not arrested , they gave them a statement while sitting in a police car .
Lewis confirmed details about the dispute centering around them leaving a light on and that they threw the pillows and went into the closet to get dressed to leave .
They contended in their statement that they were trying to prevent them from leaving the home and held on to him , wrapping their arms and legs around them to keep them there to obtain an apology .
When asked whether they put their hands around their throat , they responded that “ he may have grabbed it while trying to get them off them but had no intentions to hurt ( the woman ) . Lewis stated at no time was they trying to assault ( the woman ) , they were trying to leave . ”
They were taken to the police station , fingerprinted , handcuffed and released .
In a follow-up interview with police , the woman admitted `` she had grabbed their legs , but only one time , in the closet , '' according to police reports . They also said they had struck or pushed Lewis in the chest , and that they had been blocking the door to the closet for a short time , preventing them from getting in . They claimed they had not been trying to stop Lewis from leaving when they grabbed them throat .
On March 17 , the woman went to the police department to get scratches on their nose and one near their thumb photographed , police reports show .
Lewis was released on personal recognizance bond following their arraignment and told by Magistrate Tamara Garwood not to have contact with the woman .
Lewis ' next scheduled court appearance is at 9 a.m. April 12 , before Judge Elizabeth Pollard Hines .
Lewis has not returned a Free Press request for comment . Their only public statement came on Twitter when they wrote on March 15 : `` It 's sad that somebody would want to control you so bad they would ruin your life over it . ''
They were scheduled to attend an autograph signing at the M Den on Saturday in Ann Arbor but did not .
A two-time All-America cornerback for the Wolverines , Lewis is preparing for the NFL draft and scheduled to attend Michigan 's pro day workout Friday at the Glick Family Field House . Many NFL teams are expected to attend .

Diamond Reynolds , the girlfriend of Philando Castile who witnessed their shooting , said that no one bothered to check their pulse—instead , officers were more concerned with reassuring the cop who killed Castile that everything would be okay ( for him ) .
`` [ Other officers ] pulled [ the officer who shot Castile ] over to the side and they began to calm them down and tell them that it was okay and they would get through this , '' said Reynolds during a press conference on Thursday , according to Slate .
Meanwhile , Castile was unconscious and bleeding to death in the car where they had been shot five times . Reynolds and their young daughter were removed from the vehicle , separated , and eventually taken to the police station . Officers made Reynolds feels like it was them fault—like they were responsible for what had happened to their boyfriend .
`` They treated me like I did this , '' said Reynolds .
As Brian Doherty noted earlier , Castile was pulled over for a broken tail light . The officer issued contradictory instructions to them and Reynolds , asking them to both provide license and registration while keeping their hands in the air . Castile informed the officer that they were carrying a firearm , and reached for their wallet to produce their permit . The officer then opened fire .
There 's so much wrong with all of this . A man—a black man—should not lose their lives for daring to exercise their Second Amendment rights . And while the killing of Castile is by far the most galling crime committed here , the way the police treated Reynolds is also inexcusable . The cops were only capable of showing humanity toward one of their own : the officer involved in the shooting . Assuming Reynolds ' account is accurate , such utter lack of empathy on the part of law enforcement—during and after the shooting—is a grave concern .
This was not one of the GOP-controlled house 's smarter moves and I will explain that in a second here .
But first , the story via the Hill :
The House voted on Wednesday to repeal the sweeping healthcare law enacted last year , as Republicans made good on a central campaign pledge and laid down the first major policy marker of their new majority . The party-line vote was 245-189 , as three Democrats joined all 242 Republicans in supporting repeal . Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) said the healthcare law on the books would increase spending , raise taxes and eliminate jobs . “ Repeal means paving the way for better solutions that will lower the costs without destroying jobs or bankrupting our government , ” Boehner said in remarks on the floor before the vote . “ Let 's stop payment on this check before it can destroy more jobs or put us into a deeper hole . ”
Here 's why I think it is stupid , here 's what might happen to the bill now : ( H/T AP )
The House will pass H.R . 2 this week . Once that bill is passed , it will be sent to the Senate for consideration . Once the Senate receives the bill , any Senator can use Rule 14 to object to the second reading of the bill . This procedural objection will “ hold at the desk ” the House-passed bill and allow the Senate to act on the full repeal measure . If the bill is referred to committee , it will never get to the Senate floor . This procedural objection by one or a number of Senators will stop the bill from being referred to the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee ( HELP ) . If the bill is referred to committee , there is little to no expectation that the committee will pass the bill , let alone have one hearing on the bill . Objecting to Rule 14 would hold the bill at the desk of the Senate and would put H.R . 2 on the Senate calendar . This procedure could be done with a letter or call from one Senator to the party leader . This would allow the Senate Majority Leader to commence debate on the matter when they so choose . It is unlikely that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D–NV ) would move to proceed to the bill , yet there is a procedure that any Senator can use to force a debate . Any Senator can use Rule 22 to commence debate on H.R . 2 if they have held the bill at the desk .
If I know my politics and my Democrats like I do ; The Democratic Party controlled Senate will send this bill to committee to die . Which made that whole vote over in the House , a huge waste of time and…wait for it… . Taxpayers dollars !
Now the smart thing that the GOP controlled house could have done ; would have been to introduce a bill that repeals the bad stuff in healthcare — like mandates , the silly tax stuff for small and no-so-small businesses and left the good stuff in . But , like most people in politics , these morons picked the wrong way to do this .
In this last election , I voted Republican , I do not regret that at all . However , I am disappointed to see that the Republicans seem more interested in playing politics , than they are actually getting anything done . Because , whether we like it or not ; the Democrats hold the cards in the Senate and House doing idiotic stuff like this , only wastes time and taxpayers money — which is why the Tea Party was formed , and Democrats got swept out of office ; because of their blatant stupidity and just for not listening to the American people . Now , it seems that the Republicans want to play the same silly game . Let 's hope that they try the better approach here in the future .
Again , The Republicans need to look out for the American people and do things wisely ; not look out for their own political careers and continue the partisan jousting of old . That sort of nonsense will simply not work this time . It will only get them elected out of office and rather quickly .

Die-Hard Ambitions and Early Auditions
Being a law student is a tough gig , and time-management is key . Understandably , however , some things fall through the cracks and time gets away from you . For example , this article should have come out 4 days ago… but sometimes life throws you a curveball . Nonetheless , it 's human nature to make time for the important things and oftentimes we forget an obligation or two . But for the chance of a lifetime ? A call for greatness and an opportunity to land your dream job ?
Well… I can make time for that .
Saturday morning is typically the day I designate for recharging from a long week and sleeping in before hitting the books . I would say I wake up around noon on any Saturday – just like back in college . This last Saturday , however , started at 6:30am for me… which is unheard of , unless baseball is involved . Indeed , sleep is something I found myself willing to sacrifice in order to attend the Padres Public Announcer Tryouts .
Sorry snooze button , I would n't be able to give you the standard morning “ punch-to-your-stupid-alarm-clock-face ” today . I will make sure to continue to reciprocate our abusive , love-hate relationship starting Monday morning . I promise .
After going through the motions of preparing for the day , I ended up arriving at the park at about 7:00am . The line had already stretched from the homeplate gate to the intersection of Park and Imperial , so I figured I would be safe to get inside . I estimated about 90-100 people ahead of me in line , some in fold-out chairs playing cribbage and other card games to pass the time .
I met a few die-hard Padres fans ( who else would be there this early on a Saturday morning ? ) in line – a youth pastor and elementary school teacher who once dabbled in the baseball video-game industry , and a real estate agent who had a few non-speaking spots in some commercials for Valley View casino . They also brought their grandchildren with him ; bless their little hearts for supporting their grandfather . These two gentlemen would be my competition once we got inside , along with the hundreds of others that I anticipated would be arriving soon . For now , however , they were my companions in line who shared the same level of admiration and fanaticism for their hometown team .
The conversations I heard in line echoed those I have heard for years and years as a Padres fan : “ When do you think the team is going to get that big , impact bat ? ” “ You think we 're going to the playoffs this season ? ” “ Hey , if not this year , there 's always next year , right ? ” Apparently some people have already experienced and recovered some synthetic disappointment from the 2014 season – such is the lot in life of a San Diego sports fan . Despite that pre-ordained and somewhat crestfallen recovery , these people woke up early for the chance of a lifetime ; there was no real worry about the upcoming season here , just a bunch of crazy fans with nothing to do on a Saturday morning who love their hometown team .
Not everyone was your standard fan in line , however . Some people , I noticed , had arrived in full suit and tie attire with what looked like a document folder containing what I assumed was a resume of some kind . Coifed hair , fancy dress shoes , the whole nine yards for the chance at what was in effect an interview and employment opportunity . Being a lawyer-in-training , you would think I might do the same . But no , I put on my Tucson Padres hat and old Jake Peavy shirt and stood in line with a guy in their Gwynn Jersey and “ bring back the brown ” shades .
The line had grown considerably in the first hour I was there ; it stretched all the way past 10th avenue and looped around the stadium from what I could see . News vans arrived , media personnel interviewed random people in line , and the buzz seemed to grow and grow until 8:45 when the gates opened and everyone started to file inside .
Once at the gate , I was greeted by a “ liability waiver ” and “ employment opportunity form. ” Two lovely ladies from the Pad Squad smiled and asked for my name as I signed away my legal rights to the Padres so they could use my voice and likeness for any future purpose ( if they so choose to do so ) . I was given a number – 96 – and my name just barely fit on the card ; the woman did not anticipate the obnoxiousness of my long name , but hey . I wanted a memento if I did n't walk away from this experience with anything else .
After signing our lives away , we were directed to the seats along the first baseline where we would wait for a chance to read a script into a microphone and have our voices blasted throughout the stadium via the wired-in public address system . It had never occurred to me what the process would be like , but the sight of a plain microphone seemed exciting but underwhelming all at the same time .
I sat and watched individuals walk up to the microphone and read off a script that was handed to them , some were really good , others were okay , and some were interesting to say the least .
“ Leading off for the PAW-DREES in the bottom of the fourth inning , the first baseman , number 23 , YONE-DER AH-LAN-SER ” … “ Now pitching , JOE-AH-KWIN BEEN-OYE-T ” … “ EEV-ER-ETH CAH-BREA ” … “ CHRIS DEE-NO-FREE-AYE ” … these were some of my favorites . Not because I thought they were incorrect or anything like that , but because the smile on their face afterwards was awesome .
They just butchered maybe one of their favorite player 's names , but they were so happy .
Yes , fans were happy to hear their voice boom from the right field nosebleeds to the façade of the Western Metal building , and echo and resonate for just a brief moment . They were happy to be in their favorite ball park and trying for their dream job . Frankly , they were just happy ! Accent or no accent , presence or no presence in their voice , hook or no hook , these people were ecstatic to just be there .
To me , those people were better candidates than the suit and ties , some of whom probably did n't know a slurve from forkball , let alone a rammycackle from a can of corn . Nonetheless , being a public address announcer requires diction , poise , presence and fluidity . The air of professionalism will no doubt carry those candidates beyond the jersey-donning every-man and woman . So the long shot was ever present in my mind , but the joy of getting to hear my voice echo through Petco Park reigned supreme .
When it was my turn to speak , I do n't remember how I did . I stepped in front of the microphone , held the number I was given under my chin , and stared down at the script I was handed whilst being filmed by a handful of cameras on the foul territory dirt . No butterflies , no worries , no concerns , just talking .
It went by quickly .
I think I did okay , but I was excited to hear my voice at all . I got to announce Chase Headley and Kyle Blanks for the batting order , a pitching change for Joaquin Benoit ( “ WHA-KEEN BEN-WHA ” is how I said it , lord knows if that is right or not ) , and a public address announcement about the boys and girls club of America . I think I 'll remember those unnecessary bits of information for a very long time .
Very little information was given afterwards other than being directed out of the park , for they anticipated a large group to filter through the park that day . Through reading the Padres official Twitter account , announcements for callbacks or rejections will be sent out via e-mail around February 3rd . Regardless of how it turns out for me , I had a great time observing the plethora of people who filed through and getting the chance to speak at my favorite baseball stadium .
It was an opportunity that I had to take advantage of . Perhaps it was just a publicity stunt . Perhaps I do n't have a snowballs chance in hell , and perhaps the team did not handle the termination of Friar Frank Anthony with the utmost grace – these are not things that run through your mind when there 's an open call for your dream job .
Given the chance to wake up at the crack of dawn to even be considered a member of the Padres organization in broadcasting or announcing again ? I would do it twice over , maybe even wake up a little bit earlier .
But for now , I 'll just cross my fingers and return to my school work . A die-hard fan is what I was before I entered the park , and a die-hard fan I will remain . Win , lose , acceptance or rejection , I will keep my chin up for the team and keep myself counted amongst the Friar Faithful .
Still… here 's hoping . Go Padres .

This Drew Estate My Uzi Weighs a Ton ( MUWAT ) Kentucky Fire Cured `` Just A Friend '' Toro came to me by way of a bomb from a good friend ‘ Evil Derek ' who I met on the Cigar Safari in April of 2013 . They were kind enough to send out some of these for review .
I remember smelling the Kentucky Fire Cured tobacco leaves when I was on the Cigar Safari in April 2013 . Unfortunately I did n't have the opportunity to smoke it , until now .
Nose :
This certainly sets the bar for aromatic scents . BBQ sauce , hickory , pipe tobacco , mesquite . I 'm not sure whether I want to smoke this , or put some salt and pepper on it and eat it . The nose is very different from anything I 've experienced to date .
What 's really interesting here is that with the cellophane on you really are n't prepared for the sensory experience once you take it off . The cellophane does an excellent job of keeping the cigar contained .
Construction :
The Drew Estate MUWAT Kentucky Fire Cured `` Just A Friend '' comes in a Toro sized vitola measuring 6 ” by 52 ring gauge . The wrapper is a rich deep brown color , with no contruction issues .
The Uzi Weighs a Ton Kentucky Fire Cured line is a collaboration between Drew Estate and Joya De Nicaragua . The cigars themselves are produced out of the JdN factories , but under the Subculture Studios line .
During the original blend design , they struggled with getting the Kentucky Fire Cured leaf to burn properly . Nicholas Melillo was responsible , along with Fritz Bossert , to figure out how the arrangement the leaf to make this possible . This blending process goes back all the way to 2010 .
Flavor :
First Third
Tons of savoriness from the very start . A really thick mouthfeel after each draw that lingers with you . I 'm definitely getting that pipe tobacco flavor on a deep draw , but surprisingly it dissipates quite quickly . There is some medium strength pepper that starts in the throat and moves forward as I progress .
My initial thoughts are that this cigar is really unique . Reminiscent of a heavily peated scotch .
After the first third establishes itself I get some intense sweetness , but it fades after a few minutes . The flavors in the first all seem to appear , and then slowly fade . I think a ‘ flavor stew ' would be the best way to describe it . Some shock and awe on the taste buds .
After about 10 minutes I start to get some very light leather after taste . The mouthfeel starts to be reminiscent of a Liga Privada T52 but with pipe tobacco sweetness .
Middle Third
I pick up some cedar breaking through the MUWAT `` Just A Friend '' moves into the second third . The savoriness from the first third falls off in the middle third . The mesquite and pipe tobacco flavor is still present on a deep draw .
Last Third
More of the same in the last third . The primary flavor profile is that smoky combination of mesquite and pipe tobacco flavor . There is a slight bitterness present as the last third wraps up .
Burn/Draw :
I cut with a v-cutter and the draw on the MUWAT Kentucky Fire Cured is in the sweet spot . Just like any other cigar I 've smoked from Drew Estate , the smoke production here is quite generous . Total smoking time was just under the 2 hour mark .
Value :
I do n't have any pricing as of yet for this release . As soon as the information becomes available I will backfill the information . If I had to guess , I would expect the Toro sized “ Just A Friend ” to come in around the $ 8 – $ 9 mark .
Final Word :
The Drew Estate MUWAT Kentucky Fire Cured `` Just A Friend '' is a really different cigar . I 'm not certain that this would classify as a regular cigar for me , but the flavor experience is so different from a typical blend that I want a few of these around just for their uniqueness . I keep using the words different and unique because the overall smoking experience is a bit hard to properly encapsulate into words . Now a week later after enjoying it , I 'm still playing the experience again in my mind . I did find that the flavors were quite bold in the first third and then faded in complexity as it proceeded .
Drew Estate has managed to come up with a unique cigar that pushes the envelope for the industry . This is one you want to try for yourself , if only because it 's interesting to enjoy something that challenges the status quo . If you tend to enjoy scotch like Ardbeg or Laphroaig , this cigar is likely to find a regular spot in your humidor .
The American meat supplier at the center of a major food safety scandal in Asia engages in widespread food safety and labor violations at its massive processing plant in West Chicago , Illinois , former employees alleged Wednesday in exclusive conversations with International Business Times .
OSI Group LLC , which posted more than $ 6 billion in sales last year , has been under fire since Sunday , when Chinese regulators shuttered OSI 's Shanghai Husi Food Co. Ltd. meat processing facility . Chinese authorities later detained five individuals connected to the company . The moves came in the wake of an investigation by a local TV station that revealed that OSI sold expired meat and meat that had fallen on the floor to several fast-food chains throughout China and Japan .
OSI said Monday that it had launched its own investigation into the practices at the Shanghai Husi plant , and issued a statement saying that “ [ o ] ur company management believes this to be an isolated event . ”
The Aurora , Illinois , company 's West Chicago plant reportedly produces more than five million beef patties per day , making it one of OSI 's largest facilities . Sheldon Lavin , CEO and chairperson of OSI , has said that the company is the world 's largest protein supplier for McDonald 's ( NYSE : MCD ) . The West Chicago plant is mostly dedicated to providing meat products for the fast food giant , which the supplier has done without major scandal for four decades .
But OSI 's food safety problems may extend beyond Asia . Aurora resident Rosa Maria Ramirez , 47 , described practices they allegedly witnessed at the West Chicago plant where they worked for six years .
“ The meat would fall on the floor and they would put it back in and pack it , '' Ramirez told IBTimes through a translator Wednesday evening . `` They would spit in the meat , and have sweat dripping off their faces into the meat , and there were times when people 's gum would drop out of their mouths into the meat and they would just let it go if they could n't find it . It 's a requirement for every person to wash their hands when they go into the production area but pretty much nobody did it . ”
OSI did not respond to phone and email requests from IBTimes seeking comment Wednesday evening .
The claims by Ramirez , who worked as a meatpacker at the plant until last week , jibe with those of another former West Chicago plant worker who spoke with IBTimes on condition of anonymity .
The former OSI employee worked at the plant as a grinder operator and production line team leader for a little more than a year , ending in 2011 when they quit for a less demanding , higher paying job . They say that workers engaged in a wide range of food safety and labor violations “ pretty much every day ” while they were employed there . As a team leader , they say they reported suspected food safety violations , but alleged that they were often rebuffed by supervisors .
“ You were supposed to throw out the meat if there was someone picking it up off the floor and throwing it back in , but sometimes I reported it and they just let it go through and I could n't do anything about it , ” they said .
“ Another big problem was hair . When they kill the cows , a lot of times hair got into the meat . If we saw it on the line , we were supposed to 'kill ' the meat -- throw it out . But sometimes , once or twice a month , they would let it go through , have us pick out the hair and then let it go through . People picking up things with their hands and not changing gloves would happen pretty much every day . ”
Both Ramirez and the unnamed former worker said there was only one United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) inspector posted at the plant when they worked there , and that they almost never actually visited the plant 's 10 production lines , which produce about 1,200 patties per minute each , according to Ramirez .
“ They had their own quality control people who walked around but they were n't really there watching , ” Ramirez alleged . “ I would see [ the USDA inspector ] in the production office , which is separated from the production floor , once or twice a week , and most times when I 'd walk by he 'd be asleep . They never came down to the floor . ”
The other former worker corroborated Ramirez 's allegations : “ There was a USDA inspector but I only saw them once downstairs . Most of the time they were in a special office upstairs and they just sat up there most of the time . ”
Both sources also allege that OSI consistently violated labor regulations in order to ensure that workers were as productive as possible . OSI did pay both workers more than $ 10 per hour -- more than the Illinois minimum wage of $ 8.25 per hour -- for the majority of their tenures with the company , but “ working conditions were very bad , '' Ramirez said . `` We worked liked mules . There was discrimination every day . ”
Ramirez said that discrimination allegedly manifested itself in the form of inappropriate touching and sexual harassment by their team leader . But , they claim , their supervisor said they “ was lying ” when they reported the behavior and fired their days later . They also allege that they were pressured by OSI to work while injured .
“ I 've hurt myself there multiple times . I did something to my shoulder a couple of times , but they forced me to come back to work , ” they said . “ [ OSI 's ] doctor said I was fine and if I did not come back to work I would be fired . My doctor said I needed surgery . ”
The other former OSI employee alleges that the company did not allow workers enough time even for bathroom breaks .
“ They had cameras everywhere and if you took more than two minutes past a 15-minute bathroom break , they yelled at you , ” they said . “ Your break starts the second you leave your machine , and it takes five minutes to get to the break room , get all your equipment off , and then it takes five minutes to get the equipment back on and wash your hands . So you really have only a couple minutes to actually be in the bathroom , pretty much . ”
After Chinese media reported on the food safety violations at the Shanghai Husi Food Co. Ltd. meat plant , McDonald 's issued a statement .
“ We are committed to the highest standards of food safety and our customers are always our number one priority , ” the company wrote . “ If confirmed , the practices outlined in the report are completely unacceptable to McDonald 's . We are no longer serving product from the factory . This matter is being thoroughly investigated and we are cooperating fully with the authorities . ”
McDonald 's spokesperson Becca Harry did not respond to an IBTimes request for comment on the former West Chicago plant employees ' allegations Wednesday evening .
A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that OSI 's West Chicago plant employed one USDA inspector . The inspector is in fact a federal employee .
One day , cameras may be able to capture less data but produce images that look just as good as a traditional photo . Bell Labs is the latest to attempt such a feat , and it 's doing so while eschewing another major camera standby , the lens . The laboratory has developed a single-pixel camera that only uses a series of transparent openings to capture its image , without any glass to direct the light . The system uses a technology called `` compressive sensing , '' which is still in its early stages of study . The idea is that instead of a camera capturing a full image and then whittling the data down into a small , compressed file like a JPG , a camera could instead capture almost exactly what it needs , making capture times much quicker .
No lens , always in focus
This is n't a reality just yet , however . Compressive sensing cameras build their final image by comparing the differences that come in through each aperture , and right now that takes too much time for them to shoot anything other than a still life . But by removing the lens , Bell Labs adds another impressive feature to its camera : its shots are always in focus . One always-in-focus camera , the Lytro , is already on the market , but Bell Labs sees its new tech as a practical way to shrink the size and cost of future cameras .
Bell Labs ' device is built with `` low cost , commercially available components , '' which primarily amount to a semi-transparent LCD panel , a one-megapixel imaging sensor , and a computer to connect it all to . The LCD panel was placed in front of the sensor , and light came in through white `` openings '' in the panel . The camera measured the data separately for red , green , and blue light , and used a computer to stitch together the final image . While the images do n't demonstrate the finest image quality , they emphasize what compressive sensing is capable of . The books were captured using only a quarter of the camera 's total imaging capabilities , and the soccer ball was captured using even less , just one-eighth .

Deployed appropriately , tech can improve pay by driving up productivity . It can help ensure that British jobs are increasingly interesting , productive and profitable . And it can make our economy fairer : by tackling rent-seeking and anti-competitive business models .
Take productivity . Sensors in UPS trucks tell the drivers the most efficient delivery routes , the quickest way to unload , or when a part is about to break . These constant , data-driven improvements are why UPS drivers are among the best paid in their industry .
Abcam , a UK life sciences firm worth £1.5bn , takes orders on the web and uses robot-powered fridges to select and deliver antibodies for shipment . Its effective data use has turned it from a small start-up to dominant world player , with more revenue per employee than other organisations in its industry .
Or look at the savings to consumers or the way technology has already revolutionised travel by automating much of the clerical work of a travel agency . How online banking has helped us all pay bills or check balances online . Other sectors , as yet untouched by technology , are now ready for disruption . Much of the property conveyancing process could now be digitised for example , speeding up and simplifying what is after all the biggest purchase most people ever make .
Britain has enormous potential to benefit from the next act of this revolution . We can , if we want , be the tech capital of the world . But we face fierce competition for that prize , and getting this right requires three things .

There was quite a shock for a bike thief who got more than they bargained for in Dublin after getting rugby tackled to the ground as they tried to make their getaway .
A video shared by 360 Cycles Shop in Clontarf , shows Lithuanian mechanic Marius Judickas leave their carbon bike at the door of the shop before someone comes over and tries to snatch it .
Luckily Marius made it back just in time to catch the thief and rugby tackled them to the ground before they could get away with the €2,500 bike .

RICHMOND , Calif. — This quintessentially working-class town has made the news in recent years for electorally beating back the vested interests of polluting Big Oil .
But this town has an older history that contributed mightily to winning World War II . During the great global push against fascism and for democracy that the U.S. joined after the attack on Pearl Harbor , the government commissioned over 3200 Liberty and Victory ships for military and cargo use . More than any other shipbuilding yard in the country , the Kaiser works here sent as many as 747 ships out to sea .
With so many young men in the service , the call went out for women to join the workforce , and they streamed in from across the country . “ Please come , ” Priscilla Elder , now 96 , heard in their home state of Iowa , “ they need women badly. ” That 's how they got to Richmond , alongside thousands of other women , soon dubbed “ Rosie the Riveters ” after a contemporary song recorded by The Four Vagabonds ( check it out ! ) .
Every Friday , visitors to the Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond have the opportunity , as I did last week , to meet with some of the original Rosies , now all in their nineties , who are proud to share their riveting stories . As Catherine ( Kay ) Morrison said of their defense work as a journeyman welder , “ We can help our country and ourselves at the same time. ” At a time when the minimum wage was 25 cents an hour , Morrison earned $ 1.38 with their American Bureau of Shipping certificate qualifying them for flat , vertical and overhead welding . After the war was over , the savings these women set aside helped them purchase a first home or a small plot of land for themselves and their growing families .
Before the war , Richmond , population 23,000 , was a quiet little town with two prominent features : It was the terminus for several rail lines , and it had a deepwater harbor . Within two years it expanded to 130,000 to accommodate the “ home front heroes. ” Some found housing in trailer parks , many slept in their cars and trucks , or even outdoors under cardboard and tarps , and others shared beds in revolving shifts . Businesses were open 24 hours a day so workers could do their shopping . Factories offered round the clock childcare .
Agnes Moore , who turns 97 this month , described how they came to Richmond . They heard about good jobs for welders on the radio , not even knowing what a welder did . Off they went to the hiring hall in Richmond dressed in their finest black suit , matching high-heeled pumps , gloves and veiled hat . The receptionist looked them over and suggested Agnes take an office job , but Agnes insisted they wanted to be a welder , like they heard on the radio .
In a quick transformation Agnes started donning heavy cowhide leathers — asbestos-lined jacket , bib , overalls , gloves to the elbows — steel-toed boots , and a welder 's cap and hood . “ You had to learn how to hold your head so it would n't fall off. ” Underneath the hood women wore their famous bandannas to hold back their shoulder-length hair .
“ With all that heavy clothing on , ” Marian Sousa told us , “ other welders did n't even know if you were a man or a woman. ” Yet the women observed that you could tell a woman 's welding job from a man 's : “ It was like creating an embroidery in metal . ”
“ It was smoky , dirty , dusty work , ” Agnes recalled , “ but I was happy to be doing it because I wanted us to win the war and bring the boys home , so I did n't complain. ” They were one of those “ ordinary people who did extraordinary things , ” as so much popular culture of the time , such as Aaron Copland 's well known Fanfare for the Common Man , liked to express .
A new ship rolled out of the yard every 30 days , the speed owing largely to prefabricated technology . Workers did n't even bother to attend the launching ceremonies , they were so commonplace . The Robert E. Perry famously was built in four days . Whirley cranes lifted prefab pieces into place and the welders expertly joined their seams together . Richmond became “ the city that won the Purple Heart . ”
Kay Morrison said that at first , in February of 1942 , when they entered the shipyards , they saw signs reading “ No women or blacks wanted , ” but that changed very soon as the demand for labor exploded . When they showed up to apply for work , a supervisor asked her , “ Do you belong to a union ? ” Kay barely knew what a union was and was unsure what to answer . Before they could speak , the hiring agent said , “ Do n't worry , we can hire you and then you can join the union. ” The Boilermakers Union was the principal union for shipyard workers .
During the war , in the interest of unity , wages were equal for men and women , and the Richmond workforce soon included African Americans , Native Americans , Chinese and Filipinos , as well as whites . A third of the Kaiser Shipyards workforce were women .
After the war , women were encouraged to give up their manufacturing jobs for the returning servicemen , and keep a tidy , happy home for them and the Baby Boom children that started coming . But not all women responded to that call . Some had formed close friendships with other women . Many social historians cite these wartime experiences as liberating , and in fact the Rosie the Riveter National Park featured a number of expository panels concerning the influence of war production on the emerging postwar gay and lesbian consciousness .
For many women , the skills they acquired led to future careers or at the very least a powerful self-confidence they might never have achieved . “ From that point on , I thought , ” said a woman in the 15-minute documentary film shown at the park about the Rosies , “ I can do anything I want to do . ”
But mostly , the Rosies were forgotten . “ We stepped out of traditional roles and created new ones , ” Marian Sousa said . And then , “ I thought I would drift through my life invisible to everybody. ” The revived feminist movement a generation later popularized the famous “ We Can Do It ! ” image originally created as a weekly Westinghouse poster .
Marian 's sister Phyllis made a point of writing to the president of the United States , starting with Bill Clinton , appealing to the government to recognize the contributions of the 20 million women who entered the workforce at home to win the war . Finally , the Rosies ' plea was answered . Vice President Joe Biden and their wife Jill hosted a contingent of them at their home . They said , “ This is the start of the real women 's liberation movement. ” And at a White House reception , as shown on ABC News , President Obama made an appearance to greet them , not expecting their full-on , lip-kissing embraces .
Finally , Marian says , “ My descendants will know I was somebody . ”
In recent years the National Park Service , this year celebrating its centennial , has begun a more in-depth examination of the national experience , highlighting some of our country 's tragic history as well the scenic areas and battlegrounds for which it was once almost exclusively known . An excellent , informative website for the Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Park , which is housed on what was once the thriving Kaiser shipbuilding yard , can be accessed here .

Ruth Fath writes from Princeton , New Jersey :
Recently , after my husband 's death , I donated to our local Jewish Center a very old Torah scroll that we had bought many years ago . With it , I also gave the Center two yadayim , as I thought they were called . When I mentioned them to our cantor and Torah reader , however , they corrected me and said they should be called yadot . Others have told me I was right and they were wrong . What is the correct plural form of yad when referring to the pointer used in reading the Torah ?
A Torah pointer , held by the reader to keep track of their or their place in the parchment scroll of the Pentateuch , is called a yad , Hebrew for “ hand , ” because it traditionally takes the form of an arm with a hand , its fingers curled in a fist except for a pointing forefinger . And the regular Hebrew plural for yad is indeed yadayim , –ayim being a special dual ending for items that come in pairs . ( The standard plural ending in Hebrew is either –im or –ot . ) In pre-biblical times , presumably , such an ending was used , as it still is in the dual ending of –eyn in Hebrew 's fellow Semitic language of Arabic , for two of anything , whether houses , goats , or watermelons . But this feature had already vanished from the Hebrew of the Bible , in which the dual plural is restricted to a fixed and not very large number of words and can not be freely applied .

Although this is the situation in contemporary Hebrew , too , many of the words that do take the dual plural are common , everyday ones . The largest group of them pertains to body parts , as in ozen , ear , plural oznayim ; katef , shoulder , plural k'tefayim ; berekh , knee , plural birkayim ; and so forth . Others categories pertain to numbers ( me'ah , a hundred , ma'tayim , two hundred ; pa'am , once , pa'amayim , twice ) ; units of time ( sha'ah , hour , sha'atayim , two hours ; yom , day , yomayim , “ two days ) ; and coupled objects ( kav , crutch , kabayim , crutches ; m'tsilah , gong , m'tsiltayim , cymbals ) . Some anomalous dual plurals—like shamayim , sky , mayim , water , and tsohorayim , noon—have no singular form and function in both capacities like the English fish and deer . And while , for the most part , the dual ending has ceased to be productive in Hebrew , new words have occasionally continued to be coined with the help of it even in modern times , such as ofanayim , bicycle , from ofan , wheel , and n'kudotayim , colon ( the punctuation mark ) , from n'kudah , point .
Yet the Princeton Jewish Center 's cantor is right . Torah pointers in Hebrew are yadot , not yadayim . The reason for this is not difficult to discern . Unlike hands , Torah pointers do not come in pairs , so that a dual ending for them would not be logical . Indeed , this is the rule for all body-part duals having other , secondary meanings . Safah , for instance is the Hebrew word for lip , in which sense it takes the plural s'fatayim ; but it also means language ( compare the similar double meaning of English “ tongue ” ) , and when it does , its plural is safot . Or take kaf , palm ( of the hand ) , whose plural is kapayim . It also , though , denotes a spoon ( the physical resemblance is obvious ) , and spoons are kapot .
Still another example is one with which some of you may be more familiar . Regel in Hebrew ( dual plural raglayim ) means leg or foot , but when it takes a non-dual plural in the phrase shalosh ha-regalim , “ the three regalim , ” it refers to the three holidays of Sukkot , Pesaḥ , and Shavuot on which Jews made the pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem . ( The expression comes from the Hebrew words for pilgrimage and pilgrim , aliyah l'regel and oleh regel , which might be translated as “ an ascent on foot ” and “ an ascender on foot , ” although not all scholars would agree with this . )
In a word : one hand is the same as one Torah pointer , but many Torah pointers are different from many hands . That 's the long and short of it .

I ca n't resist sharing with you the following letter , sent in response to my remarks two weeks ago about the Hebrew/Yiddish drinking chant eleh toldoys noyakh . It comes from David Goldenberg , who writes :
Your last column on bilingual or even trilingual rhymed couplets reminded me of an incident from my youth . In the old-fashioned school I went to , we were taught Bible , starting with the story of Creation , by declaiming first the Hebrew and then its Yiddish translation in a typical sing-song chant , e.g . : “ Breyshis , in onfang [ in the beginning ] , boro eloykim , hot got beshafn [ God created ] , es ha-shomayim , di himl [ heaven ] . . . ” When I was still in elementary school , I landed my first job , which was tutoring a young boy just starting out in school who had difficulty in learning their Bible . By this time , bilingual ḥumesh-taytsh [ Yiddish-Hebrew Bible translation ] had transmuted into trilingual Hebrew-Yiddish-English , so that the boy had to learn : “ Breyshis , in onfang , in the beginning , boro eloykim , hot got geshafn , God created , ” etc . In one lesson , we came to the verse “ Vayaker Yehuda , un Yehuda hot derkent , and Judah recognized. ” No matter how many times we went over it , the boy could n't remember the Yiddish word derkent . Finally , having met the boy 's father , I tried a mnemonic device and said : “ Your father smokes cigarettes . What brand do they smoke ? ” A light went on in my pupil 's mind . “ I get it ” they exclaimed . “ He smokes Kent ! ” And this time , asked by me to repeat the verse once again , they chanted : “ Vayaker Yehuda , un Yehuda hot derkent , and Judah smoked . ”

A while back I spent some time figuring out how to serve interactive shiny apps through my website , but I have n't had a chance to build anything until recently . I set out to create a few simple shiny apps in R that I could use as a sort of test run , and I 'm writing those up here .
In this post I 'm going to be analyzing some open data provided by the Social Security Administration on the popularity of baby names over the years -- specifically , since 1880 . Data comes from the Social Security Administration
In the application below , you can view the 10 most popular baby names for any year since 1880 , either for males or females . You can also click the play icon directly below the year slider to view an animated history of the most common names .
In the next application , you can enter any name , and the graph will display how the popularity of that name has changed over time . Be sure to also select whether the name is for males or females , or you 'll likely see some unexpected results !
After building the shiny applications above , I got interested in whether I could identify any meaningful trends over time in the data . I wanted to see whether the concentration ( the proportion of babies born with a given name ) of the most popular names was relatively static over time , or whether this fluctuated . I was also interested in finding trends in the number of babies born with each of the most popular names . To investigate these , I used a subset of the original data , grabbing the 10 most common male and female names for each year since 1880 . I went through several iterations of how best to display the data , and ultimately arrived at the graph below , which I quite like .
I was excited that this project gave me an opportunity to make use of David Robinson 's gganimate package , which I must regrettably admit I had n't had a chance to experiment with previously . For those unfamiliar , this package makes it incredibly easy to create animated ggplot graphs , and it 's awesome !
I wanted to create some kind of trailing visualization to make it clear how patterns and trends were changing over time . The implementation here was adapted from Thomas Pedersen 's example which they used to produce this image .
In the graph below we can use the trailing effect to easily identify trends that occur over a series of years . The grey background data also helps us to visualize how any given year compares with the overall history . I see 5 key periods present themselves in the data :
Early Years ( 1880 - 1910 ) : This period is characterized by a low number of babies born ( due to the much lower population at this time ) as well as a high concentration of the most popular names , in some cases reaching almost 10 % . This means that the most common names were being used by a very high percentage of the population during this period . Toward the end of this time period , we begin to see declines in the concentration statistic .

We do n't see much change in the concentration of names over this period .
: In this period we see an explosion in the number of babies born with the most popular names . We do n't see much change in the concentration of names over this period . Intra-War Period ( 1921 - 1940 ) : In this period both the number and the concentration of births is remarkably consistent , with almost no changes on a year-over-year basis .
: In this period both the number and the concentration of births is remarkably consistent , with almost no changes on a year-over-year basis . WWII & Baby Boom ( 1941 - 1957 ) : In this period we again see a huge increase in the number of babies born , corresponding to the well-known baby boom that occurred in the post-WWII years . We actually see this increase beginning during the war , in 1941 . We also see a slight decrease in the concentration of the most popular baby names during this period .

Though overall birth rates did begin to decline in recent years , this change is not due primarily to a decline in birth rates , but rather to an increased equity in the popularity of names , which means that the most popular names make up a much smaller percentage of overall births .

Russia , facing deepening scrutiny over accusations that it orchestrated a doping campaign during the Sochi Olympics in 2014 , on Sunday made a public plea for its track and field athletes to be allowed to compete in this summer 's Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Writing in The Sunday Times , a British newspaper , the Russian sports minister said Russian officials , coaches and athletes made “ serious mistakes , ” but they stopped short of specifying them or admitting to any state role .
“ We are very sorry that athletes who tried to deceive us , and the world , were not caught sooner , ” wrote the sports minister , Vitaly Mutko . “ We are very sorry because Russia is committed to upholding the highest standards in sport and is opposed to anything that threatens the Olympic values . ”
But they added : “ It can not be right that clean athletes should suffer for the behavior of others . In no other walk of life would this happen . ”
For decades , Mr. Murdoch and others have sought to challenge the sports hegemony of Walt Disney 's ESPN , but they either employed the wrong strategy or came late to the party . Since ESPN 's founding 35 years ago , the value of sports rights has soared , and contracts that used to last three or four years now extend up to two decades .
By adding Time Warner 's sports and broadcasting assets , which include the National Basketball Association and the N.C.A.A . men 's basketball tournament , Mr. Murdoch would gain a stronger position in the sports world , not only eliminating one bidder from a competitive field but also giving the combined company more leverage with sports leagues .
On Wednesday , Time Warner disclosed that it had rejected a takeover offer from 21st Century Fox , the conglomerate controlled by Mr. Murdoch . Such a deal — which Mr. Murdoch is likely to continue to pursue — would create a behemoth in the television and film industries , bringing together the Fox Broadcasting network with Time Warner 's premium cable channel HBO as well as the movie studios Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox .

But the deal is also a rare opportunity for 21st Century Fox to acquire a host of sports rights in one fell swoop . In addition to the N.B.A . and college basketball , Time Warner , home to the TBS and TNT networks , also holds sports rights for Major League Baseball and the P.G.A . Championship , a property of P.G.A . of America . Those rights , along with Time Warner 's ownership of digital properties like the Bleacher Report , would complement Fox Sports 1 , which carries baseball , Nascar , college basketball and college football . And having a lockdown on those sports rights would be a valuable bargaining chip in fee negotiations with pay-television distributors , such as cable and satellite companies that are in the midst of a wave of consolidation of their own .
Pay-television operators are battling to defend themselves against so-called cord cutting , or the trend that people cancel their pay-television subscriptions in favor of cheaper streaming alternatives , such as Netflix , YouTube , Amazon and Hulu . Live sports are a valuable defense . About two out of every five adults report that they would n't cancel their pay-television subscription because they want access to live sports , according to a recent Harris Interactive Poll .

Twitter vs Female Protagonists in Video Games
Thanks # XboxOne # E3 press conference for revealing to us exactly zero games featuring a female protagonist for the next generation . — Feminist Frequency ( @ femfreq ) June 10 , 2013
Above is a tweet I made this afternoon in reaction to the fact that none of the games presented at Microsoft 's Xbox One E3 press conference featured female protagonists . Below are some of the Twitter replies to that observation which exemplify the male privilege and male entitlement endemic in the gaming community today . This is also a window into what it 's like to be a female video game critic on Twitter .

Baked by Melissa is a shining example of the basic nature of modern day North Eastern America . Tiny cupcakes baked by dudes working for a chick named Melissa , cupcakes that are utterly delicious and yet somehow leave you hungrier than you were before your first bite .

That 's kind of where we 're at with Melisandre of Asshai from Game of Thrones . Carice Van Houten has been arguably the hottest actor on Thrones from the get-go , and with Natalie Dormer 's Margaery Tyrell dead , they compete only with fellow Ginger Sophie Turner ( Sansa Stark ) for hottest actor on the show .
And somehow , that bitch got banished by Jon Snow , Da King in Da Norf . What are you thinking , Jon ? Sending that broad out into the snow by herself ? Nature is scary . She 's going to die and it 's all your fault . Melisandre is needed for the Long Night and the White Walker War . We ca n't have them running off into the snow to bake tiny cupcakes in the wilderness .
All because they baked that one little girl . So what ? I 'm sure every famous baker has accidentally or intentionally killed an innocent child at one point or another . It 's just par for the course .
Feel for Melisandre . Feel for them and bring them back to their former glory .
WE WANT CARICE BOOBS !

Silicon Valley , which overwhelmingly aligned itself with Hillary Clinton 's campaign , is filled with anxiety and uncertainty in the wake of Tuesday night 's election . While Clinton offered a specific technology policy blueprint during the campaign , President-elect Donald Trump only vaguely discussed the space , leaving much in the air .
Within the technology industry -- and markets -- concerns are swirling around expectations developing for Trump 's platform . Trump has indicated support for tighter trade and immigration policies ( Trump challenged the H-1B program , which tech companies rely on to hire foreign employees ) ; resistance to large mergers ; opposition toward new technologies , such as autonomous vehicles , that evolve workforces and eliminate certain jobs ; a push for U.S.-based manufacturing ; and a heavy-handed approach to privacy and privately-held data . And these policy concerns come layered on top of fear about the social and cultural implications of Trump 's presidency .
In response to Silicon Valley 's shock and dismay , many entrepreneurs are urging startups and business leaders to work to more actively understand the economic needs and pain points of the entire country -- not just consumers in tech epicenters -- and to invest more energy and resources into products and services that help people across the full spectrum of economic realities , especially the tens of millions of Americans who live in poverty .
“ An election was held and many leaders in the tech industry did n't understand the suffering that millions of people in this country are going through , ” said Ben Parr , a partner at DominateFund who also serves as chief marketing officer of chat-bot startup Octane AI .
“ One can only hope that Donald Trump , the elected official , is a better person than Trump the candidate , but being angry and saying you want to leave the country does n't actually solve any problems , ” Parr continued . “ We need to make more products that are empathetic to all people and those who feel left behind . ”
Parr noted that it 's important to understand why Americans voted for Trump , describing the election results as a wake-up call to many Silicon Valley CEOs and government leaders that “ the world does not revolve around us . ”
“ A lot of products have been built for people in cities , and not a lot of products have been built for people in the country or in small towns where factory jobs have gone away and not been replaced with something that makes someone proud to be an American and a working person , ” Parr said .
Several entrepreneurs noted that the way individuals consume social media , particularly the echo chamber effects of digital networks -- makes it easier for people to avoid engaging with viewpoints that differ from their own .
“ You see what you like and enjoy on social media , but it 's not a full picture of the world , ” said Krishna Subramanian , CEO of social media analytics company Captiv8 . Subramanian noted that Trump overall had dramatically stronger social media engagement than Clinton throughout their campaigns , in part because of their inflammatory , “ uncut ” messaging . “ It 's important to look outside the bubble and the ideals that we live in , because America is bigger than the Valley . ”
The people and publications we follow and engage with on social networks like Facebook and Twitter -- and the platforms ' algorithms , which reinforce what users like -- massively influence the content people consume online . Parr , for example , noted that they grew up in a 7,000-person Midwestern town “ that votes Republican in every cycle . ”
“ The posts my high school friends and Silicon Valley friends talk about are completely different , ” Parr said .
While Trump 's presidency raises plenty of concerns , entrepreneurs also expressed hope that the election will encourage Silicon Valley to direct more thoughtful attention to issues such as racial discrimination , gender equality and civic engagement . The fact that Clinton was not elected , despite their extensive public service experience and qualifications , could spur companies to reflect more on diversity and invest more in anti-discrimination programs .
“ These issues are front and center and they remain front and center as long as Trump is in the White House , ” Parr said .
Subramanian also said they expect Trump 's win to encourage Silicon Valley residents and city dwellers to become more deeply involved in government and politics moving forward .
“ Right now Silicon Valley is going through the grief phase , ” Parr said . “ I 'm hopeful Silicon Valley will reflect and focus more on understanding the concerns that face fellow Americans . I believe you will see more products that focus on a wider range of people and technologists trying to bring a perspective to Silicon Valley that 's sorely lacking . ”
Parr said if they could make a call to all entrepreneurs and technologists , it would be this : “ Keep building products that help people and the world . Nothing productive can come out of anger , so focus your energy on getting things done . ”
In their Talking Points Memo tonight , Bill O'Reilly slammed the pro-illegal immigration lobby 's objections to President Donald Trump 's executive actions .
On Wednesday , Trump signed two executive orders that cover a range of immigration enforcement measures , including starting the wall on the southern border and threatening sanctuary cities with a cut-off of funding .
O'Reilly said that `` all hell is breaking loose , '' as many on the left simply do not want U.S. immigration laws enforced .
They pointed out that whether they oppose immigration laws for humanitarian , personal or political reasons , the fact is that it 's up to Congress to change existing laws .
`` You apply to come to the U.S.A. , and your application is either accepted or rejected . If you simply show up with no papers , you 're violating U.S. law , '' O'Reilly said . `` So , there really is n't any legal argument here . It 's all about theory and politics . ''
They said that `` irresponsible '' politicians like Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio are ignoring federal law by operating sanctuary cities .
`` So if these protesters and these loony mayors think that open borders and lax immigration enforcement are good things , they 're idiots and deserve to be scorned , '' O'Reilly said .
`` Breaking it down , sanctuary cities and counties promote anarchy . If the left does n't like immigration law , petition Congress to change it . If the mayors refuse to obey federal law , President Trump should cut off federal funds immediately . ''

Bitch Planet is a comic that uses the language of exploitation , visual and verbal , to discuss the topic of exploitation . And it 's definitely well-informed on that subject . Kelly Sue DeConnick 's script is full of metaphors about patriarchy , organized religion , the use of mass media and sports to manufacture consent , and the concept of exploitation in all senses of the word . After four issues , the book has only begun to gather some narratives forward momentum , allowing itself space to tell side-stories and engage in colourful and dynamic world building .
The first thing to understand about this comic is that it 's a deep homage to 1970s science fiction , sports movies and exploitation pornography . Artist Valentine De Landro uses the visual language of films like 1974 's Caged Heat , but also evokes that pink-shifted printed look of 1970s exploitation comics , often deliberately fading portions of the image to suggest a well-worn book . But the main tool is in the backgrounds of the panels , which simulate an old-fashioned comics ' dappled colour printing , often slightly and charmingly incorrectly pin-registered . But De Landro 's style is quite diverse , pulling in extreme contrasts in style between pages and panels . Colourist Cris Peter and letterer Clayton Cowles also shine in their contributions to the overall feeling of a hard-edged exploitation comic .
A flashback sequence from issue # 3 features Penny , and a deliberately “ aged ” printed comic page style
But Bitch Planet is n't simply a “ women 's prison ” book : it 's fairly rigorous “ hard ” science fiction , with a cogent and well-thought-out vision of a future society , tweaking aspects of our present-day culture to make sociological points . This is obviously a very well-established way to use the genre , but it adds a great deal to the already impressive richness of the book .
In this future society , the ruling class is almost exclusively male , and uses the media to keep themselves in power ( a thought that 's not particularly science fiction , or even fiction for that matter ) . Women who step out of line for one reason or another , committing crimes that run the gamut from minor offenses to murder , are placed in a penal colony known informally as “ Bitch Planet ” . Meanwhile , back on earth , the political status quo is maintained not by the constant give-and-take of international politics , but by a brutal sport known as “ Megaton ” . The President even says the words , “ Let the games begin , ” in issue # 2 , which is as on-the-nose as it needs to be : this is the decadent , corrupt late Roman Empire .
On Bitch Planet itself , we are introduced to a colourful variety of inmates , including the large black woman , the tough black woman ( Kamau Kogo , a central character ) and other well-worn women 's prison tropes . The first issue , in fact , plays a great deal like Orange is the New Black in space , giving us a middle-class white woman 's perspective on this den on inequity . Issue # 3 , focusing almost entirely on the backstory of the gigantic Penny Rolle , also brings up thoughts of Jenji Kohan 's series in its structure and thematic content .
Kamu , the apparent protagonist , in the “ confession module ”
But this is a very self-aware book : everyone involved seems to embrace the tropes rather than run from them . In issue # 4 , for example , the creators actually literally title a sequence , “ The Obligatory Shower Scene ” , involving sexual activity , lots of nudity and a peephole , which does n't exactly work out the same way as in Porky 's . But that shower scene , like the other exploitation conventions , is used to advance the developing plot through-line , featuring Kamau 's attempt to recruit from within the women 's prison to form a Megaton team ( the first such team to feature female players ) in order to save their family . Kamau themselves is being exploited , and this exploitation is presented via another form of exploitation , involving voyeurism and literally a male gaze , but the added layer is that these women are actually consciously putting on a show for the peeping Tom , and using that power to conceal their true agenda . Kamau becomes the character who breaks the pattern , however , refusing to submit to some forms of exploitation and determined to assert their power and their individuality in an environment that specializes in removing them both .
The ladies practice Megaton
In four issues , Bitch Planet has established a compelling setting and style , but it seems to lack a strong , sympathetic central character . Kamau is growing into that role , and their motivations are being uncovered , but a “ revenge ” plot is always going to be problematic , even if it is revenge in the interests of saving a family member . That sort of story has been told many times before , and it tends to end on notes that are either saccharine ( hugs and kisses , we saved the day , etc ) or extremely nihilistic , neither of which makes for the most compelling drama . As the series goes on , because we must note again that it feels as if the plot is only truly snapping into motion in issue # 4 , it will be interesting to see if the creators can negotiate an original path through this dense , self-referential and genre-blending setting and style .
There 's undoubtedly a great deal of talent and creativity in Bitch Planet , and a compelling feminist awareness of exploitation . Let 's hope , as we head into the pivotal Megaton competition set up for issues 5 and beyond , that it can also find a strong emotional core to ground all of the satire and commentary .
RBI issued a warning that it will not regulate any Virtual Currency including Bitcoin in India and warned people who were dealing with the currency in India of the risks involved , saying that they 're exposing them to financial , legal , operational and security related risk . On December 24 , RBI stated in the advisory that it had been “ examining the issues associated with the usage of virtual currencies ” under the legal and regulatory framework of the country . It said that the creation , trading or usage of virtual currencies including Bitcoin are not authorised by any central bank or monetary authority and added that there is no established framework for recourse to customer problems .

The main points raised by RBI were :
– Since they are not created by or traded through any authorised central registry or agency , there is no way to get back stolen coins .
– There is no established framework for recourse to customer problems / disputes / charge backs etc .
– Users are exposed to potential losses on account of volatility in value of these currencies .
– Bitcoin exchanges are set up in various jurisdictions whose legal status is also unclear . So all traders are exposed to legal and financial risk .
– Usage of Virtual Currencies for illegal activities .
– Users subjected to unintentional breaches of laws such as anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism ( AML/CFT ) laws .
Later in December ToI had quoted RBI deputy governor KC Chakrabarty as saying that RBI still does n't know if Bitcoin operations in India are legal or not . “ Whether it is… legal or illegal , we do n't know . If it crosses the limit of legality then people may face a problem . So people should be cautious , should understand , ” they said . This however , contradicts an earlier statement by an RBI spokesperson which stated that RBI does n't consider it to be a legal tender and , therefore “ trading in Bitcoin is not legal . Obviously , there can not be regulations from RBI for an illegal activity . People who use it , do so at their own risk and responsibility . ”
MediaNama Take
The RBI has clearly not yet taken a decision on whether it wants to ban bitcoins or regulate them , but this statement is an indication that it is working towards a decision : eventually , we might either see the RBI create a regulatory framework for bitcoins and virtual currency , or we might see an outright ban on them . The RBI tends to be cautious and conservative with such decisions , and the first step for the regulator is to warn bitcoin buyers that as of now , they have no protection under law , so they should proceed with caution . The next step is anybody 's guess .
*
Here is the full advisory issued by RBI :
The Reserve Bank of India has today cautioned the users , holders and traders of Virtual currencies ( VCs ) , including Bitcoins , about the potential financial , operational , legal , customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to .
The Reserve Bank has mentioned that it has been looking at the developments relating to certain electronic records claimed to be “ Decentralised Digital Currency ” or “ Virtual Currency ” ( VCs ) , such as , Bitcoins , litecoins , bbqcoins , dogecoins etc. , their usage or trading in the country and the various media reports in this regard .
The creation , trading or usage of VCs including Bitcoins , as a medium for payment are not authorised by any central bank or monetary authority . No regulatory approvals , registration or authorisation is stated to have been obtained by the entities concerned for carrying on such activities . As such , they may pose several risks to their users , including the following :
VCs being in digital form are stored in digital/electronic media that are called electronic wallets . Therefore , they are prone to losses arising out of hacking , loss of password , compromise of access credentials , malware attack etc . Since they are not created by or traded through any authorised central registry or agency , the loss of the e-wallet could result in the permanent loss of the VCs held in them .
Payments by VCs , such as Bitcoins , take place on a peer-to-peer basis without an authorised central agency which regulates such payments . As such , there is no established framework for recourse to customer problems / disputes / charge backs etc .
There is no underlying or backing of any asset for VCs . As such , their value seems to be a matter of speculation . Huge volatility in the value of VCs has been noticed in the recent past . Thus , the users are exposed to potential losses on account of such volatility in value .
It is reported that VCs , such as Bitcoins , are being traded on exchange platforms set up in various jurisdictions whose legal status is also unclear . Hence , the traders of VCs on such platforms are exposed to legal as well as financial risks .
There have been several media reports of the usage of VCs , including Bitcoins , for illicit and illegal activities in several jurisdictions . The absence of information of counterparties in such peer-to-peer anonymous/ pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism ( AML/CFT ) laws .
The Reserve Bank has also stated that it is presently examining the issues associated with the usage , holding and trading of VCs under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country , including Foreign Exchange and Payment Systems laws and regulations .

Main Roads Western Australia has published two guides for cyclists : this guide on sharing the path and a second guide for cyclists and motorists on sharing the road . The guide , Share the Path : A Guide for Pedestrians and Bicycle Riders is targeted at both cyclists and pedestrians with the aim of informing both users about good practice and the law . All cyclists and pedestrians are encouraged to read the guide .
To encourage good behaviours on our shared paths the guide reminds pedestrians to …
be Visible
Keep to the left
be Predictable
be Vigilant
Listen
and cyclists are reminded that
Pedestrians have right of way
to slow down around walkers
around walkers to ring your bell
to give room
to avoid riding in groups as you may not be able to see clearer ahead
Overall all good advice in my view and I think that Main Roads Western Australia has done a good job with the guide . They have kept it to two pages , to the point and easy to understand . All we need now is for cyclists AND pedestrians to do the right thing . It takes two to tangle .

A new study published in The Journal of Social Psychology examines subtle homophobia in the classroom . The study , conducted by professors at the University of Houston , surveyed 622 undergraduate students to find how sexual orientation , gender and political ideology intersect when opinions are formed about professors . Unlike its obnoxious older sister , subtle prejudice masquerades as egalitarianism and can be easy to dismiss . Using similar studies that tested racial discrimination , the authors set out to uncover how subtle prejudice operates , specifically looking to see if students who held anti-gay feelings used typographical errors and political ideology as excuses to malign the professor .
Each student was provided with one variation on the same syllabus for a course called “ Psychology of Human Sexuality. ” Syllabi differed by gender ( marked by pronouns and gendered names ) , sexual orientation ( identified by membership in professional organizations and family details ) and political ideology ( conveyed in tone about sexuality ) , as well as the presence or absence of typographical errors . They were then asked to respond to a questionnaire regarding the professor 's knowledge , warmth and bias .
In a second study , students were further divided on homonegative and modern homonegative scales to see if more pronounced differences arose . If , like me , you were n't sure what these two scales mean , here 's a quick primer from the article :
“ Like modern racism , which regards racism as a thing of the past and presumes that African Americans would succeed if they just tried harder ( McConahay , 1986 ) , modern homonegativity rejects lesbians and gay men on the grounds that they attempt to obtain special privileges because of their orientation , or because it is believed that they ﬂaunt their sexuality . Modern homonegativity emphasizes the social importance of assimilation on the parts of lesbians and gay men , rather than all-out rejection . ”
The researchers found that students viewed gay professors as more biased than their straight counterparts . While this is n't really unexpected , not all the study 's findings were so predictable . Conservative gay men were viewed to be more biased than liberal gay men while liberal lesbians were seen as more biased than conservative lesbians . Straight professors , on the other hand , received no different bias assessment according to their political leanings . Homonegative and modern homonegative students were less interested in taking the course regardless of the professor . Because I know you all love grammar , you 'll be happy to know that typos were universally reviled .
In an email from Kristin Anderson , one of the authors , they said that the study “ raises questions about the ability of some students to learn from minority professors . Even when there is no evidence of bias , students believe that minorities bring political baggage into the classroom , whereas whites , men and heterosexuals bring with them the cool heads of objectivity . ”
The belief that individuals who belong to unmarked majorities are more objective is one of the trademarks of subtle prejudice . The fact that Judge Walker 's ability to rule on Prop 8 was called into question illustrates just how pervasive and problematic this type of discrimination can be . On a more day-to-day level , maybe you can relate to having your participation or concern written off for being “ too emotional ” or “ too personally invested ” in an issue . The reality is that when it comes to social change , there 's a place for everyone who wants in , not just the heroic , objective [ fill-in-the-blank majority member ] father figure looking out for the underprivileged .
Acknowledging that subtle discrimination exists is the first step toward dismantling it . Unfortunately , it can be difficult to get someone on board with an idea that requires them to question their assumption that our society is thoroughly equal . Perhaps , through knowledge uncovered in studies like this one , one day we can become that society .
Legends of the Hidden Temple was not a particularly good show , but it was notable for its `` Temple Run '' segment , in which emotionally fragile children were prodded through a disorienting maze in which they were expected to fulfill not-specific-enough instructions and complete a ridiculous array of trial-and-error puzzles within three minutes , a time constraint so overbearing that roughly 75 percent of the contestants failed .
Also , adults in costumes would jump out and scare them at random , putting a sudden , and completely unfair , end to a strange , televised day of answering trivia questions and completing Double-Dare-ish puzzles that suddenly unfolded into this ... this labyrinthine , frustrating , humiliating nightmare , in front of us all .
You 're likely familiar with it if you grew up with cable television in the mid-1990s . I watched it , since Nickelodeon aired it quite often , but man did I not like it . In the Temple Run , the game show 's final round , an 11-to-14-year-old kid was to find a prize by navigating through a series of rooms , many of which required them or them to complete a `` puzzle '' to unlock the door to the next area .
The majority of these were n't actually puzzles so much as an exercise in flipping switches until one of them worked . The contestant might have to sit in a series of thrones , or grab a torch and stick it into whichever pedestal happened to unlock the door . The show 's producers often failed to clearly mark these things , and the result was an embarrassed , hopeless preteen meandering around a room on national television .
See , this is what I 'm talking about .
THE FIFTH-WORST MOMENT IN 'LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE ' HISTORY .
The fretful coaching you hear is the voice of the show 's host , Kirk Fogg . It really makes for some fantastic free verse poetry :
She 's gon na have to go find a door
Gon na have to hit the door , the --
Gon na just have to hit the --
They gon na have to get a torch
Gon na have to get a torch and put it into one of the holes
One of the holes in the front , it 's the room with the three torches
Right in front of you
The very front
You have to put it , the torch in the hole in the front
No ! The other hole in the front
In the very front
I am 30 years old . If you sent me into that room with those instructions , and I was exhausted after a day of competing for prizes on television , that might be me up there . `` The very front ? '' I would think . `` What very front ? In relation to how I entered , or the camera , or what ? What is very front ? ARE YOU VERY FRONT ? AM I VERY FRONT ? WHAT ARE DIRECTIONS ? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF WORDS ? '' And then I would start blubbering and collapse on the floor . The fire department would have to remove my listless , sobbing person from the arena with an industrial cherry-picker .
I 've always wondered whether the kids were given a tour of the temple off-camera before they actually played . If they were , that girl 's confusion could easily be understood , since there are a lot of rooms and a lot of things to remember . And if they were n't -- and my hunch is that , no , they were n't -- God , that 's cruel .
THE FOURTH-WORST MOMENT IN 'LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE ' HISTORY .
This poor kid drops into the room , then tries in vain to find the button that will open the next door . They begin to climb the ladder to return to where they came , but stops when Fogg warns them against it , and spends some more time wandering around the room , hitting things , trying to figure out what the Hell is supposed to be going on in that room .
They climb up the ladder again . Fogg warns them again . They do not care . They are bailing , y'all .
It 's important to note that this is from the first-ever episode of Legends of the Hidden Temple . If you 've set up a children 's game show , and the very first run through the final round overwhelms the kid so much that they just gives up and tries to leave , that should perhaps signal that you need to significantly reconsider what you 've got going here . LOL NOPE DOIN ' THIS FOR 120 EPISODES THOUGH .
I 've watched a lot of Temple Runs during the last few days , and I 'll tell you this : you see that resigned look quite often in this show . It 's one of the things about the show that frustrated me as a kid . `` If I were them , '' I reasoned , `` I 'd run through the whole thing . ''
Something clearly happens on the other side of that screen , though .
THE THIRD-WORST MOMENT IN 'LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE ' HISTORY .
Under a time limit and with an audience of a million people , a simple three-piece puzzle basically turns into a search for the Higgs boson . The Shrine of the Silver Monkey is one of the only `` puzzles '' in the entire Temple Run that 's actually a puzzle , albeit a simple one : you put the feet on the base , then the belly on the feet , then the head on top . As long as the pieces are turned around the right way , you 're all set .
Two things about that : first , the room is designed for people of adult height . The monkey pieces are placed on shelves so high that shorter kids have to jump up and knock them down , and the puzzle base is certainly taller than it needs to be . You 're playing head games , Nickelodeon . WITH CHILDREN . WHO HAVE SHOWN UP TO PLAY YOUR GAME BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN .
Sigh . Second , the Silver Monkey is one of the final rooms , and by the time a contestent gets there , they or they are running out of time . So this kid is tired , flustered , hurried along , deafened by the roars of friends and family and Kirk Fogg 's fret-coaching , and that is why this girl thinks it prudent to solve the puzzle by holding all three pieces at the same time and kind of just knocking them together .
That room ruined these kids , man . So many Temple Runs ended in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey , with the puzzle half-assembled . When I mentioned earlier that three-quarters of the final round 's contestants failed to win , I was n't joking . From TV Tropes :
Over the series ' 120-episode run , just 32 Temple runs were completed successfully , for a win rate of 26.7 % .
Now , please also consider that each episode started with 12 kids , who were eventually whittled down to two Temple Run contestants , which means that 4.4 percent of Legends of the Hidden Temple contestants actually won . As the show 's host , Kirk Fogg did what they could to soften the blow .
Which was n't much .
THE SECOND-WORST MOMENT IN 'LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE ' HISTORY .
WELL DONE , set designers . You managed to engineer the Temple Run perfectly , such that it ended with a kid reaching in agony for the prize , mere inches away when the clock ran out . And Kirk Fogg is so sorry for you .
Fogg was in interesting territory : constantly having to deliver bad news ( `` you lost , '' `` you 're going the wrong way , '' `` you 're running out of time '' ) while simultaneously trying to boost the kid 's ego . Their go-to phrase was always , `` you did a great job ! You did such a great job ! '' with the lauding , shirt-tucked-in-his-khakis timbre of a youth group pastor after a trust fall .
And , lastly ... we must visit this .
THE WORST MOMENT IN 'LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE ' HISTORY .
The full play-by-play :
Player 1 enters the Cave of Sighs .
Player 1 enters the Pit of Despair .
Player 1 enters the Throne Room ( encounters Temple Guard , gives up pendant ) .
Player 1 re-enters the Pit of Despair .
Player 1 enters the Gargoyles Room .
Player 1 re-enters the Pit of Despair .
Player 1 re-enters the Throne Room .
Player 1 enters the Heart Room ( encounters Temple Guard , exits game ) .
Player 2 enters the Cave of Sighs .
Player 2 enters the Pit of Despair .
Player 2 enters the Throne Room .
Player 2 enters Heart Room .
Player 2 re-enters the Pit of Despair .
Player 2 re-enters the Heart Room .
Player 2 re-enters the Pit of Despair .
END
Between the two of them , these kids accomplished absolutely nothing , spending their entire three minutes wandering through the same three rooms , not really even trying to solve anything . They circled back to the Pit of Despair four times .
Surely these kids are n't dumb . Surely they are good at problem-solving and get good grades in school and know how to do long division . This is just what this show does to you , man : it rips the ambitions out of your preteen soul and reduces you to a wandering ghoul without short-term memory or long-term ambition . It envelops you in a matrix of horrors . In these three minutes , the waters rise and fall , the fields erode to canyons , civilizations are built and toppled , and at the very end , you are left to cling to a rope , without destination or purpose .
You short heroes . You little fools .
The BioComposites Group creates car panels out of natural fibres , like hemp , flax and wood . ( Alberta BioComposites Group ) With a little elbow grease and a lot of ingenuity , a new Alberta business is churning out biodegradable auto parts made from wood , hemp and flax .
The BioComposites Group plant , located on Drayton Valley 's Bio-Mile , uses a one-of-a-kind manufacturing process to make door panels , kick pads , cup holders and dashboard panels .
`` We take waste wood fibre and waste agricultural fibers , and then needle them together with a process that creates a mat that is used for interior panels , '' said Dan Madlung , CEO and co-owner of BioComposites Group .
The lightweight panels are then shipped to the United States , where they are pressed then passed along the manufacturers .
Madlung , along with their wife and business partner , Brenda , have been up and running now for more than a year .
The panels are already being tested in a few high-end cars , Madlung said , including BMW , Audi and Mercedes-Benz , and in large trucks like Kenworth and Peterbilt .
And they hope their product will one day make fibreglass and plastic components obsolete .
`` And it 's very big for Alberta , in that every acre of hemp that we use sequesters five times as much CO2 as a forest does . So it 's pretty big for the environment . '' Madlung said on an interview with CBC Edmonton 's Radio Active .
Quite a ride
They 've shipped out a couple of truckloads so far , and are expecting permanent customers to come online within the next month .
But it has n't been easy to get a foothold in the industry .
It took years to get the business off the ground , but after $ 12 million of their own private funding , $ 4.5 million from Alberta Innovates Bio Solutions , and investment from Ottawa 's Investments in Forest Industry Transformation initiative they are finally gaining speed .
`` Its an interesting marketplace because automakers are very cautious and we 're the only plant in North America that produces this type of material , '' Madlung said .
`` So the product development phase on this very substantial and lengthy . ''
Seeing green
But once their production lines start pumping at full capacity , Madlung expects $ 5 million in annual revenues for the company .
`` It 's a really big opportunity because hemp and flax are grown pretty well 100 per cent for their seed . So they cut the top two inches off the plant and you have that in your cereal , '' said Madlung .
`` But what we use is the stalk , and that 's a 100 per cent waste product right now . So we take that stalk and we pay the farmers for that , and the farmers get that extra revenue .
The lightweight products are coveted by manufacturers because they help with fuel efficiency and their environmental footprint .
Imagine a giant vacuum cleaner looming over America 's economy , drawing dollars from its bottom to its upper tiers . Using US Census reports , I estimate that since 1985 , the lower 60 percent of households have lost $ 4 trillion , most of which has ascended to the top 5 percent , including a growing tier now taking in $ 1 million or more each year.1 Some of our founders foresaw this happening . “ Society naturally divides itself , ” Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist , “ into the very few and the many. ” Their coauthor , James Madison , identified the cause . “ Unequal faculties of acquiring property , ” they said , inhere in every human grouping . If affluence results from inner aptitudes , it might seem futile to try reining in the rich .
All four of the books under review reject Hamilton and Madison 's premises . All are informative , original , and offer unusual insights . None accepts that social divisions are inevitable or natural , and all make coherent arguments in favor of less inequality , supported by persuasive statistics .

The Spirit Level is a prodigious empirical effort directed to a moral purpose . It ranks the quality of life in twenty-three countries , mainly European , but with Singapore , Israel , and the United States also on the list . To evaluate the well-being of each society , Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett use indices ranging from obesity and incarceration rates to teenage births and the feelings people have about their fellow countrymen . They then relate these variables to how income is distributed in each society . Here they deploy the Gini ratio , a three-digit coefficient purporting to measure the extent of income inequality within any grouping for which figures are available . Their national Gini scores range from .230 in egalitarian Sweden to .478 in highly stratified Singapore , with the United States second highest at .450 . Linking social indicators to economic disparities , the authors conclude that “ reducing inequality is the best way of improving the quality of the social environment . ”
As income gaps grow , they write , it 's not only the poor who suffer . Unequal societies not only bear “ diseases of poverty , ” but also “ diseases of affluence. ” The latter include cancer and cardiovascular disease as well as the afflictions of well-off people who are “ anxiety-ridden , ” “ prone to depression , ” and “ seek comfort in overeating , obsessive shopping and spending. ” At this point , as elsewhere , the authors tend to get carried away . I 'm not sure I 'm ready to rank compulsive spending or eating too much as diseases . Even so , Wilkinson and Pickett are blunt in their summary : “ inequality is socially corrosive. ” What 's missing in their analysis is how far , if at all , income disparities may also degrade the deprived .
The authors do n't go so far as to say that people with above-average…
Some Canadian couples trying to conceive say the country 's laws prohibiting compensation for egg donors is driving them underground or across the border .
Although it is illegal to compensate egg donors in Canada , women told CBC News they would undergo a fertility drug cycle that usually results in about 20 human eggs for $ 5,000 and $ 7,000 .
Under the Assisted Human Reproduction Technology Act passed in 2004 to prevent cloning , it 's not illegal for women to sell eggs , but it is illegal to buy them . Seeking donor eggs or sperm is legal .
Anyone convicted of buying eggs can face a fine of up to $ 500,000 or 10 years in jail .
Many fertility experts agree thatfew women will go through the intense drug therapy necessary to donate eggs for free .
Couples go on fertility vacations
After repeated attempts at expensive in vitro fertilization with negative results , Anne and their husband did what many infertile couples are doing : went on a fertility vacation to the U.S. , where compensation services are legal .
`` You feel like you 're doing something wrong , '' said Anne , who does not want their last name used because of the circumstances surrounding the birth of their baby girl .
`` You do know that it 's not accepted in Canada , soyou dofeel a little bit like you 're breaking the law . You 're kind of reluctant to really say exactly what you 're going there for , or coming home from . You do feel a little bit like a criminal . ''
The couple contacted an American clinic , went through its list of donors , picked one they liked and eventually did IVF twice with donor eggs , paying $ 25,000 US each time . Each time , about $ 3,000 of the fee went to the donor as payment for their eggs .
No one is sure how far the Canadian law reaches . For instance , while clinics in Canada refuse to deal with anyone who has paid for eggs in this country , it 's a different matter if they 've paid a donor in the U.S .
A couple may use an American clinic , pay for eggs from a younger donor , whichare more likely to produce a pregnancy , create embryos on the U.S. side of the border , pack them in a freezer tank and drive them back to Canada .
'Is that a violation of the law or not ? '
Canadian clinics will then implant the U.S.-made embryos .
`` Is that a violation of the law or not ? '' asked Dr. Roger Pierson , a fertility doctor in Saskatoon who is with Canada 's Fertility and Andrology Society . `` There are many , many technologies that would be deemed illegal in Canada , but are easily circumvented by simply driving across the border . ''
`` We do n't have customs agents trained to ask questions beyond 'Have you bought new tires for your car ? ' We do n't have them ask people if they achieved a pregnancy while they were abroad . ''
Pierson is frustrated with Canada 's laws , which they call `` political quavering '' on an emotional issue that is based in everyday science .
In the meantime , American agencies field calls from Canadians who want to be parents , asking which services are available and how the law works in Canada .
`` I 'm constantly getting calls , '' said Stephanie Scott , who runs the Texas-based agency Simple Surrogacy , whichmatches couples with surrogates willing to carry their babies .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - WikiLeaks published more details of sites around the globe that the United States considers vital to its interests , prompting strong criticism that the website is helping militants identify sensitive targets for attack .

The details are part of 250,000 diplomatic cables obtained and being made public by the website .
The list begins with a cobalt mine in Kinshasa , Congo and refers to various locations in Europe where drug companies produce insulin , treatment for snake bites and foot and mouth vaccines .
In the Middle East , it notes that Qatar will be the largest source of imported liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) by 2012 and also refers to the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia , the largest crude oil process and stabilization plant in the world .
Al Qaeda mounted an unsuccessful attack on Abqaiq in 2006 , and there were warnings that the WikiLeaks cable setting out so many sensitive targets could help militants .
The release of the information drew strong condemnation from the United States and the United Kingdom .
“ Let me condemn in the strongest terms the leaks of information ” about the sites , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters in Washington . “ The American people themselves have been put at risk by these actions that I believe are arrogant , misguided and ultimately do not help in any way . ”
Holder also said the Obama administration was considering using laws in addition to the U.S . Espionage Act to possibly prosecute for the release of the information .
The State Department called the release “ irresponsible ” and warned that such information about critical infrastructure supporting the U.S. economy and other countries could play into the hands of al Qaeda .
“ Information is classified for good reason , most especially information involving critical infrastructure that supports our economy and those of other countries , ” State Department spokesperson P.J . Crowley said in an emailed statement .
“ ( WikiLeaks founder ) Julian Assange has released what amounts to a targeting list that will be of interest to groups like al Qaeda , ” Crowley said .
“ REPREHENSIBLE ”
British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the publication of the list “ particularly reprehensible . ”
“ There is great concern of course about disclosing a list of targets that could be of use to terrorists or saboteurs , ” they told BBC radio . “ I think it is absolutely reprehensible the publication is carried out without regard to wider concerns of security , the security of millions of people . ”
John J. LeBeau , a former CIA officer who teaches security studies at the George C. Marshall Center in Germany , said the list “ might put ideas into jihadist heads as to what to profitably target . ”
“ The real story here though , I think , is that putting this type of material online makes clear that WikiLeaks does not care about the consequences of its actions , ” they told Reuters .
“ If the leaks complicate the security posture of the U.S. , or the West in general , WikiLeaks is indifferent . ”
Professor Richard Aldrich of Warwick University in central England said it had the potential to help militants find targets in energy security .
“ We 're pointing out to them how they should change our behavior to hurt us more , ” they told Reuters .
“ This document has been given very wide currency . It 's improbable to think that the terrorists are not taking notice . ”
The cable sets out details of facilities whose loss could impact the public health , economic or national security of the United States . It was drawn up after the State Department last year asked U.S. missions abroad for a list of such sites .
It refers to places where undersea communications cables reach land and energy routes including the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline which runs from Azerbaijan to Turkey .
PAPERS STAYED AWAY
“ While we 're not commenting on specific details in the stolen documents , a list of critical infrastructure would certainly fall into the category of damaging material that provides our adversaries with valuable information , ” U.S. military spokesperson Colonel David Lapan said .
“ This is one of many reasons why we believe WikiLeaks ' actions are irresponsible and dangerous , ” Lapan said .
Two news organizations involved in the initial publication of stories based on the WikiLeaks cache of State Department documents did not publish stories about the cable listing sensitive infrastructure sites overseas .
Neither Britain 's The Guardian nor The New York Times mentioned the cable in their coverage although it was included in a WikiLeaks document dump to them months ago .
Guardian Editor Alan Rusbridger told Reuters their staff made a conscious decision not to run a story about the cable or link to it because they were uneasy about its content .
“ We 're comfortable not to have done this one , ” they said .
A person familiar with the views of other journalists who had early access to the cable said that the view among key reporters was that the document contained little information of news value , but at the same time had information that could be quite useful to militants .
Bill Keller , executive editor of the New York Times , said that while their paper had received the cable some time ago , their reporting staff did not “ focus on the cable until it popped up in the British press today. ” They said the cable did not “ fit neatly into any ” of the “ thematic boxes ” that Times journalists had chosen for organizing coverage of the massive cache .
Keller said however that had they paid more attention to it earlier , “ I 'm sure we would have deemed it unfit to print . ”
They said the newspaper would have decided the material was not appropriate to be written about for two reasons : that “ nothing in it was particularly new , ” and because the contents of the cable “ could be taken as an invitation to terrorists . ”
Dear America ,
We did not intend for our run to the Sweet Sixteen in the 2016 NCAA Tournament to cause harm or insult to anyone and if you have been offended by our wins over the seven-seeded Dayton Flyers or 15-seeded Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders , we apologize from the bottom of our hearts .
We made a mistake and put ourselves in an environment that does not reflect who we are as people . We regret this lapse in judgment .
Specifically , we want to apologize to certain people , schools and organizations .
To Joe Lunardi , who was very upset that the NCAA committee let us into the tournament despite being a team that they felt was lacking in bona fides . All we 've done since is make you look like you really do n't know what you 're talking about , which must be painful and hard . We did not intend for this to happen and we hope we can make it up to you one day .
To Tulsa and Vanderbilt , who we 've made look terrible by winning and , in the eyes of a few , justifying our existence in the NCAA Tournament , while you both lost in your first games and did n't , making it seem as though we were the team the committee got right . That 's on us to fix .
To Dayton , who had a great regular season , finished with a very respectable 25-8 record and earned a 7-seed in the NCAA Tournament as a mid-major , which is no small feat . However , because they were matched up with 10-seed Syracuse , they immediately became a bad team in retrospect according to national media members . We should have realized this would happen and we regret not acting quicker to find alternative seeding partners for the Flyers .
To Michigan State , who really would have been a better Sweet Sixteen attendee than us and we understand that . If there was some way we could have made sure the best team in the Big Ten did n't get embarrassed on national television by a team from Conference USA , we would have . We wish we could go back and ensure that the Spartans did n't choke on the big stage and allow a 15-seed to advance without ever leading in the game . It 's something we will have to live with for a long time .
To Middle Tennessee State , who was hailed as `` the next uber-Cinderella '' by Pat Forde until we defeated them by 20 points , at which time Forde immediately downgraded them to an opponent that Syracuse was `` gifted . ''
How The Narrative Sausage Is Made : Pat Forde Edition pic.twitter.com/eo4Ec59t8F — NunesMagician.com ( @ NunesMagician ) March 21 , 2016
We look at the way people were describing Middle Tennessee 's epic win over Michigan State before they played us . So many people praised them . So many people thought they were the real deal . So many people thought they were legit . And then as soon as we beat them , all of a sudden all of those people those Middle Tennessee sucked again . We can not apologize enough for this . You deserve better , MTSU .
To Pat Forde , for ruining your above narrative . You worked so hard on that .
To Doug Gottlieb , for distracting you just long enough . We hope you find what you 're looking for at Tulane . Seriously . That sounds amazing . We ca n't wait to watch . Because we 're gon na watch . Oh my God we 're going to watch .
To Seth Davis , whom we 've prevented from accomplishing all that `` real journalism '' they do so much of . We feel as though we 've robbed the world of it 's essence .
To Gonzaga , an 11-seed who is currently being touted as a serious sleeper contender for the Final Four . But after Syracuse beats them , they 'll only be described as `` an 11-seed that the lucky Orange were gifted on the road to the Final Four . '' Shame on us .
To all of the 2-Seeds , who have been beating 15-seeds and 7-seeds on the road to the Sweet Sixteen for decades . That used to sound impressive , but now that Syracuse has done it , it 's easy and cheap . We did n't mean to take you down with us but unfortunately we have . We assume pundits will always describe any 2-seed who advances to the Sweet Sixteen as lucky from now on .
To Georgetown , who sucks .
To everyone who filled out a bracket , who for one reason or another already had Syracuse out by now . Either because Michigan State is supposed to be here or because you just do n't like Jim Boeheim and you hope they fall into a pit of acid . We wish we could make your dreams come true but unfortunately we acted before we thought and now we have to live with the consequences . We do not say that lightly .
To the NCAA , who tried to teach us a valuable lesson by punishing the current players on the team for things that players seven years ago did . We should have said thank you . Instead , we did this , just one year later . It 's a slap in the face and the further we go the more we expose the feeble nature of your existence . Again , sorry .
To America , who just wants to enjoy the NCAA Tournament for crying out loud . Ca n't you just enjoy it without having to see Jim Boeheim and hear about the 2-3 zone and wonder how long Trevor Cooney has been in college and try to figure out how in the hell this Orange team made it this far ? That 's what we want for you as well and we 're working towards making that happen at some point in the future .
In closing , we want you to know that this run to the Sweet Sixteen does not reflect our core values . This is not what Syracuse Basketball is about and it is not what we stand for . We are consulting our pastors , rabbis , and imams for guidance at this troubling hour . We are deeply disappointed that our dominating performance so far has overshadowed the gritty play of Duke , the classy way North Carolina carries themselves , and whatever it is any non-ACC teams that happen to be left in the tournament are like .
We are ready to put this chapter behind us and move forward towards a better NCAA Tournament and a better America .
Sincerely ,
Syracuse Basketball
Barenboim , 72 , who is general music director of the German capital 's flagship opera house , the State Opera , `` is in talks with Iran about a possible concert in Tehran by the Staatskapelle Berlin , '' the house said in an emailed statement .
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier had agreed to take over the patronage of the concert as they `` supports Daniel Barenboim 's dedication to making music accessible to all people , irrespective of national , religious or ethnic boundaries , '' the statement said .
Further details of the concert would be announced `` once the negotiations have been concluded , '' the opera house said .
Barenboim 's plans have nevertheless angered Israel .
The Israeli culture minister Miri Regev had said Wednesday that they intended to send a letter of protest to German Chancellor Angela Merkel calling on them to block the concert .
`` In my letter I shall stress that Daniel Barenboim 's appearance in Iran harms Israel 's efforts to prevent the nuclear agreement and gives encouragement to de-legitimisation of Israel , '' they wrote on their Hebrew Facebook page .
`` Iran is a state which supports terror , is behind Hezbollah , Islamic Jihad and Hamas and its leaders have blood on their hands . I believe that Germany would be acting rightly if it were to cancel the appearance of the orchestra and its conductor , '' Regev continued .
They accused Barenboim - who founded a ground-breaking youth orchestra called the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in 1999 that brings together Israeli , Egyptian , Iranian , Jordanian , Lebanese and Palestinian musicians - of `` using culture as a platform for their anti-Israel political views . ''
Barenboim , who has also taken honorary Palestinian citizenship , conducted the Divan Orchestra in a concert in Ramallah in 2005 .
They are also controversial in Israel for their efforts to have the music of Richard Wagner , the German composer adored by Adolf Hitler , performed in the Jewish state .
Iran reached a deal with world powers last month which will see Western-led sanctions against Iran lifted in exchange for a new inspections regime and curbs on Tehran 's atomic programme .
Morné Steyn says they will play for the Springboks this year if their services are required by coach Allister Coetzee .
On 3 January , French rugby newspaper Midi Olympique quoted Steyn as saying : ' I wo n't play for the Springboks anymore . The trips , the time away , all of it has become too much . And what is more back home , Handre Pollard is back from injury . They and Pat Lambie are very talented . It 's time for them instead of me . '
However , in a statement , Digidust Sport Agency said Steyn had been misquoted .
'To date , they have made no decision regarding their international career .
'His remarks merely underlined that they are aware that South Africa has two very talented flyhalves with Handré Pollard and Pat Lambie , and that naturally , as they are both younger than him , they represent more the future of the national team than they do .
'However they keep themselves ready to serve their country and the Springboks if Allister Coetzee wishes to call him , as they have already done it 66 times in the past .
'That said , Morné wants also to mention that their current main concern is to be very performant with their club , the Stade Français Paris . '

Sanford Admits Affair , First Thoughts
South Carolina Gov . Mark Sanford wipes their tears after admitting to having an extramarital affair during a news conference in Columbia , S.C. ( AP Photo/Mary Ann Chastain )
Gov . Mark Sanford ( R-S.C. ) admitted that they had conducted an extramarital affair with a woman in Argentina whom they had gone to visit over the last five days -- during which time a massive media story developed over where they were and why .
`` I have been unfaithful to my wife . . . I developed a relationship with what started as a dear dear friend , '' said Sanford . ( The State newspaper has obtained e-mails between Sanford and their mistress . )
They said that they had met the woman , whom they did not name , roughly eight years ago and that it had become romantic within the last year . They visited them three times during the past year , Sanford said , and noted that their wife , Jenny , had been aware of the affair for the past five months .
`` First and foremost , I apologize to my wife and my four boys . I have made decisions that have hurt and will continue to hurt them , and for that I 'm sincerely sorry , '' Sanford said in a statement released after their at-times rambling announcement in the South Carolina statehouse . `` Jenny has stood by me through campaign after campaign , through hard time after hard time , and neither they nor the boys deserve this . Please offer them your prayers . ''
Sanford announced their resignation as chairperson of the Republican Governors Association but did not offer any hint of whether they were considering resigning as governor of the Palmetto State . Mississippi Gov . Haley Barbour was quickly named as Sanford 's replacement at the RGA . Barbour said the Sanford news `` hurts all of us who have gotten to know Governor Sanford over the years . ''
In their statement , Sanford also apologized to their staff for misleading them about their whereabouts and added : `` I want to make absolutely clear that over the past two days at no time did anyone on my staff intentionally relay false information to other state officials or the public at large . What they 've said over the past two days they believed to be true , and I 'm sorry to them for putting them in this position .
The State newspaper in South Carolina first reported this morning that Sanford had spent the last six days in Argentina not , as their staff had previously said , hiking the Appalachian Trail .
Sanford 's public announcement punctuates a strange and winding series of events that caused confusion within the state government and considerable chagrin among the Republican Party , which saw its second potential 2012 candidate in as many weeks brought low by infidelity .
The analysis about the press conference has just begun but we had a few initial thoughts while watching the event ( followed by a live online discussion ) .
• Sanford was clearly unprepared for the media swarm they faced . They began shakily with a riff about their time spent hiking the Appalachian Trail before rolling off a long litany of people to whom they needed to apologize . Sanford , usually an extremely confident public orator , stumbled over their words time and time again and continued to take questions well after they had promised a `` last question . '' ( In Sanford 's defense , it 's hard to imagine anyone would be prepared to make such an announcement . )
• This is not the end of the story . The problem for Sanford is that they appear to have willfully misled their staff , the lieutenant governor and the people of the state about their whereabouts -- signaling that they were likely headed to the Appalachian Trail before hopping on a flight to Argentina . There will almost certainly be some sort of investigation into whether Sanford misused state funds on this trip -- remember that they took a state-owned vehicle and parked it at the Columbia airport -- that will keep this wound raw for the foreseeable future .
• Sanford 's 2012 candidacy is almost certainly over . Having an extramarital affair is bad , but not being truthful to the people of the state and disappearing for five days is unforgivable on the national stage -- or any stage for that matter . Let the search for a new champion for fiscal conservatives begin !
• Coming nearly one week to the day after Sen. John Ensign ( R-Nev. ) admitted their own affair , this is yet another gut punch for the Republican Party , which ca n't seem to get off the mat . Republican strategists have to be wondering when enough is enough ; the spate of bad press for the party for the past few weeks has been unrelenting .
• The cover up is ALWAYS worse than the crime . It 's a cliche for a reason ; note to future politicians : if you make a mistake , you need to own up to it immediately and totally . Do not obfuscate , do not try misdirection . In the modern media environment where private is public , the truth will come out .

It started with a tip . Not an anonymous , cloak-and-dagger tip , but a tip nonetheless . The tipster told me that my writing was dull and that I should seek to improve it .
The tipster : my wife—and they were right .
It was early 2014 . And in the midst of my fourth year working as a tenure track assistant professor , I was attending a major academic conference . While there , I thought to myself : It ca n't be this way . Surely the authors of some of these articles could make an effort to improve their writing and make the papers more readable . I work in this area , am genuinely interested in the subject matter , and almost never have any desire to read beyond the abstract .
ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching ! Visit Website
Over the phone , I passed this thought on to my wife . I said something to the effect of : “ The conference is good , but a number of the papers being presented are dreadfully written . ”
“ Well , ” they said , “ so are yours . ”
“ What ? ”
“ I read most of your papers before you submit them , ” they said . “ I know the topics are important to you , but you do n't write well for readers other than yourself . It 's a chore to read your articles . You sometimes end sentences with prepositions , too . ”

A poorly written academic article on an already-esoteric topic is destined to have zero impact .
The last comment particularly stung . They caused me to look inward .
A month later , after reading Nicholas Kristof 's attention-grabbing “ Professors , We Need You ” New York Times op-ed , Joshua Rothman 's follow-up piece in the New Yorker , and Michael Billig 's clever Learn to Write Badly : How to Succeed in the Social Sciences , I decided to fail in the social sciences . I wanted to learn how to write well .
In searching for writing workshops , I did n't have to look far . The English department at my home institution , Florida State University , offered a variety of courses . Primarily targeted to doctoral candidates , MFA students , and accomplished undergrads , the courses were also open to members of the Tallahassee community at large . I enrolled , thus exposing myself to a wide variety of work under creative non-fiction 's umbrella . From Cheryl Strayed 's “ The Love of My Life ” to John McPhee 's “ The Search for Marvin Gardens ” and to Tony Earley 's “ Somehow Form a Family , ” we discussed a plethora of different essays .
The real value , however , lie in the small group workshops . In Dr. Ned Stuckey-French 's “ Advanced Article and Essay Workshop , ” I received weekly feedback about our twice-a-week writing assignments from my fellow group members . Our workshop contained several gifted writers who have worked incredibly hard honing their craft ; this much was obvious no later than the second week . Their writing flowed . Their prose simultaneously entertained and informed . They were able to transform deeply personal experiences into resonating narratives .
In contrast , my writing was described as “ sterile , ” “ overly formal , ” and “ didactic. ” I had a creeping suspicion that the latter was n't to be taken as a compliment . Nevertheless , all of the adjectives were spot on .
THREE MONTHS LATER , I 'M the proud graduate of two writing workshops . Am I a better writer now ? I like to think so . Do I have a better appreciation for the work that goes into precise , clear writing ? You bet . I also came away from the classes with a couple of ideas about how other academics could try to do the same .
First , tenure-track assistant professors in the sciences and professional programs should be actively encouraged to take at last one creative non-fiction writing workshop during their pre-tenure period . Regardless of discipline , learning how to write effectively ( and creatively ) is an important skill . If professors are to have any chance of being anything even close to a quasi-public intellectual , this should be mandatory . A poorly written academic article on an already-esoteric topic is destined to have zero impact .
Second , such seminars should be infused into the curriculum for all graduate students . During law school , I took one writing course . During my Ph.D. program , I did n't take any . The dearth of writing practice results in another generation of scholars unable to translate their research for a broader audience . My doctoral advisees are required to take at least one writing seminar as part of their coursework . While only a sample size of one , the early returns appear favorable .
BEFORE SENDING THIS ESSAY off to my editor , I showed it to my wife .
Them thoughts : It 's a “ marked improvement . ”
I hope she 's right .
Say you 're interested in learning to code . Should you go back to school and pick up a formal diploma ? Or just teach yourself ( perhaps with some help from the Internet ) in your spare time at home ?
Catalin Zorzini , the founder of Web design resource site Inspired Mag , was wondering just that , so they built an infographic on the subject . “ Some readers are confused by the relevance of attending university in a time where technology information is not locked within the university walls anymore , ” they told me .
( See also : There 's A Boom In Teaching People To Code )
After two weeks worth of extensive research , however , Zorzini said it 's not about one type of education being superior . “ The challenge is to be able to match the right type of course with the right student mindset , ” they said .
Zorzini 's finished infographic , based on information from editorials , universities curriculums , reviews , and even the opinions of practicing Web designers , wo n't tell you which method is “ best. ” But it may help you figure out which method would be best for you . Check it out below :

Tired of getting paid less than the men 's team despite a much higher level of performance , five-star soccer players from the U.S. Women 's National Team are taking a stand off the field .
Attorneys for top players Carli Lloyd , Megan Rapinoe , Rebecca Sauerbrunn , Hope Solo and Alex Morgan have filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claiming the women 's team should be paid an equal amount as the U.S. Men 's National Team .
`` I think the timing is right , '' Lloyd told Matt Lauer in an exclusive TODAY interview Thursday . `` I think that we 've proven our worth over the years . Just coming off of a World Cup win , the pay disparity between the men and women is just too large . And we want to continue to fight . ''
When the USWNT won international soccer 's most prestigious event , the World Cup , in 2015 , the team earned $ 2 million in prize money that was given to the national federation to be distributed to the players and the organization . Meanwhile , the men 's team , which lost in the World Cup 's Round of 16 , earned $ 9 million . The men 's team that won the tournament , Germany , earned $ 35 million .

`` I 've been through numerous CBA negotiations , and honestly not much has changed , '' Solo said . `` We believe now the time is right because we believe it 's a responsibility for women 's sports , specifically women 's soccer , to really do whatever it takes for equal pay and equal rights and to be treated with respect . ''
The women also shattered ratings records for soccer games in America with a record 26.7 million tuning in to watch them beat Japan in the World Cup final . The women have won three straight Olympic gold medals as well as three World Cup titles overall , while the men have never won either .

`` While we 've not seen this complaint and ca n't comment on the specifics of it , we 're disappointed about this action , '' the U.S. Soccer Federation said in a statement to TODAY . `` We 've been a world leader in women 's soccer and are proud of the commitment we 've made to building the women 's game in the United States over the past 30 years . ''
`` These women are very disappointed in U.S. soccer , '' their attorney , Jeffrey Kessler , told Lauer . `` When they asked for the same treatment as the men , they were told it was irrational . Now that might be a good answer in 1816 . It 's not acceptable answer in 2016 . ''
The complaint is the latest escalation between the players and the governing body , as the United States Soccer Federation and the union representing the USWNT are suing each other over the validity of a collective bargaining agreement signed in March 2013 . At the heart of the matter is whether the players on the USWNT have the ability to go on strike before or during the upcoming Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in order to have their demands for equality with the men met .

Sean McDermott was officially welcomed as the Buffalo Bills ' new head coach on Friday . From there , McDermott began to fill out their coaching staff by confirming the hiring of defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier and offensive line coach Juan Castillo .
McDermott and Frazier have a history together , both working under the legendary defensive coordinator Jim Johnson during their time together with the Philadelphia Eagles .
From 2001-2004 , the Eagles enjoyed a trip to four straight NFC championship games . Therefore , McDermott and Frazier 's winning pedigree should assist in turning around a Bills defense that finished 19th in the past two seasons .
With McDermott vowing to put players in a position to win and be successful , here are four players that will benefit in McDermott 's defensive scheme .
Marcell Dareus
In 2014 , defensive tackle Marcell Dareus put together a fantastic season in Jim Schwartz 's 4-3 , wide-nine scheme . Schwartz 's attacking front-four allowed Dareus to rack up an astonishing 10 sacks , which is impressive for an interior defender .
When Rex Ryan was hired in 2015 , Dareus ' pass rushing abilities were limited as they were forced to play the nose tackle position in Ryan 's 3-4 defensive front .
At 6-foot-3 , 331-pounds , Dareus was the only capable nose tackle on the entire roster . Dareus 's main responsibility at nose tackle was to two-gap and absorb blockers in run defense , while consistently battling double teams in rushing the quarterback . This led to their decline in stats in 2015 and 2016 .
The infusion of McDermott 's 4-3 front should greatly benefit Dareus . They would be able to unlock their attacking style via their excellent one-gapping , penetrating technique . Dareus 's true value to Buffalo 's defense would be recognized , and he 'd finally be able to live up to their hefty contract .
Preston Brown
The Bills ' third-round pick out of Louisville enjoyed a tremendous rookie season in 2014 within Schwartz 's 4-3 scheme .
Brown was placed at outside linebacker in Schwartz 's defense , where they recorded 103 tackles . From there , Brown finished as Pro Football Focus ' third-best pass coverage linebacker , tallying two pass defections and one interception . Brown was not only the Bills ' best coverage linebacker , but they were one of the best in the NFL .
Switching to inside linebacker in Ryan 's 3-4 defense was a tough transition for Brown . They could n't comprehend Ryan 's complex play calls , and they routinely failed in informing the defense when calling out specific checks within Ryan 's multiple defense .
Brown also endured a difficult time shedding blocks in Ryan 's scheme . With the return of McDermott 's 4-3 philosophy , Brown would be able to play with more freedom . McDermott relies on their linebackers to make plays in space — as Brown displayed in 2014 — and he 's more than capable of returning to their rookie form
Shaq Lawson
The 19th pick in the 2016 NFL Draft , Shaq Lawson , did n't have the rookie season he 'd hoped for in comparison to their fellow draft classmates . Lawson aggravated their shoulder during the team 's minicamp last spring , causing them to miss the first six games of the season .
In the eight games they played , Lawson recorded 13 tackles , two sacks and a forced fumble — all while constantly disrupting the opposing backfield .
However , in Ryan 's 3-4 defense , Lawson often lined up as an outside linebacker . The reason why Lawson was such a dominant player out of Clemson was due to their effectiveness as a defensive end in Clemson 's aggressive 4-3 scheme .
Lawson is best suited in a 4-3 scheme where they can play their natural defensive end position . Containing a high motor with violent hands in both facets of the pass and run game , this will enable Lawson to deploy their power and athleticism in optimizing their production on the field . Hiring McDermott assures Lawson will be playing as a defensive end once again .
Ronald Darby
After an outstanding rookie campaign in 2015 , cornerback Ronald Darby , along with the entire Bills ' secondary , experienced a setback in 2016 .
Although they were not as consistent as they were in pass coverage in 2015 , Darby made a major impact in run defense , finishing as PFF 's No . 2 cornerback against the run .
McDermott executed a ton of Cover-2 during their time with the Carolina Panthers . When defending the run , with Darby squatting in the flat in Cover-2 , they should be able to utilize their aggressive and fearless nature and continue to thrive against the run .
More importantly , McDermott 's history of drawing up exotic blitzes should allow Darby to play to their strengths , using their physical ability and superb athleticism in one-on-one situations , similarly to their role in Ryan 's defense .

Since 2007 or so , though , the FISA Court has bulked up like A-Rod . The New York Times revealed that it has developed a complex case law interpreting the Surveillance Act , the Fourth Amendment , and its own jurisdiction . That case law , like the orders the court issues , like the briefs the government files , and like the legal opinions from which those briefs flow , of course , secret .
An entire shadow Constitution may be growing up , parsed by a court appointed by John Roberts . That secret growth seems more alarming because of reports that the chief justice 's picks for the secret court have been skewed toward the Republican side of the bench .
The chief appoints the members of many specialized judicial panels . But the FISA Court has morphed into a very powerful institution . Perhaps it 's time the change the way it is constituted .
Professor Stephen Vladeck , a separation of powers specialist who teaches at American University School of Law , argues that when FISA was passed it made sense to give the power of appointment to the Chief -- but that `` what the FISA Court does has changed over time . '' The degree of programmatic responsibility it has taken on , they say , may be unprecedented .
For that reason , it may make sense to spread the responsibility for the makeup of the FISA courts . Vladeck suggests either creating a stand-alone specialized FISA Court , appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate , or confining the present FISA Court to warrant approval , with a transfer of the more complex oversight of surveillance programs to panels of an existing court , perhaps one like the D.C . Circuit , which has experience in the intricacies of administrative law .
Should the chief keep the appointment power ? Perhaps we can learn from recent history . In 1983 , Chief Justice Warren Burger lobbied Congress to create a new national Court of Appeals , made up of already-confirmed sitting judges . In different proposals , the power of appointment would either be held by the chief alone , or by the Supreme Court as a whole .
Officials at the Reagan White House had little use for the idea . Appointment by the chief justice , or by the Court as a whole , one wrote , `` constitutes an unprecedented infringement on the President 's appointment power . . . . '' Appointment by the chief alone would be likely to produce a solidly conservative court , but `` liberal members of Congress , the courts , and the bar are likely to object . '' Even worse , if Democratic nominees were named , they might reverse the judgments of Reagan appointees on the lower courts .
`` [ T ] he new court would be qualitatively different '' than specialized panels appointed by the Chief , `` and its members would have significantly great powers than regular circuit judges . '' If the project went forward , `` we should scrupulously guard the President 's appointment powers . ''
It was a shrewd assessment . The power to name judges to any important court is an important one , one that involves the president 's power , the appearance of integrity and impartiality on the nation 's courts , and the crucial issue of which judges get the last word on important questions .
The author of those memos was 28 years old when they opposed the new court . Today they are the Chief Justice of the United States .

That 's a violation of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 , according to the Local 100 United Labor Unions , which represents workers in the southeastern states of Texas , Arkansas and Louisiana .
On Tuesday , the group filed a charge with the Fort Worth office of the National Labor Relations Board , saying Jones ' public statements attempt to threaten , coerce and intimidate team members .
“ The law is the law . And it 's against the law to threaten someone 's job , ” said chief organizer , Wade Rathke . “ Mr . Jones is way , way , way out of line here . And they need to get back in their lane . ”
Federal law protects the rights of employees who join together to raise work-related complaints , such as issues about working conditions or pay .
The Fort Worth labor relations board will assign an agent to contact the Local 100 union and Cowboys management to investigate the charge . If there 's merit , it 'll issue a formal complaint and the trial can be brought before an administrative law judge if there 's sufficient evidence .
There comes a point many , many months after the release of a new version of Android where devoted users just ca n't quash the desire to get their hands on an even newer version . A preview of Android L is already available for download , but unless you are willing to flash your device and put up with any number of potential bugs , I would n't recommend installing it on a phone you actually need to use . But this does n't leave you without options . The talented folks behind TeslaCoil have sprinkled some of Android L 's style all over the latest version of the Nova Launcher . They 've slowly added these features into the beta since L 's debut , and now things are ready to go stable .
Changing a launcher ca n't hit apps with the Material Design stick , but it can swap out old app animations for those that have not yet arrived . Selecting the L option will cause apps to pop out from the bottom of the screen upon selection and return when exiting ( nicely summarized as `` Slide Up '' in Nova 's settings ) .
With a few taps , users can swap out that KitKat app drawer for a flat , solid white L one . Under settings , there 's the option to give the search bar the same treatment as well . And those folders ? Nova 's L setting arranges those into a nice line .
This is n't the full L experience , but it lets users get a taste without having the risk of breaking anything . Is it enough to tide people over until the final release ? Probably not . But at least it will let people get to taste L on the vast number of Android devices that have no hopes of ever getting an upgrade .
Extraordinary footage from Syria - nothing like it in the Western media . Must-see TV to understand what is really happening in Syria .
This TV segment is already a week old , but we just managed to get our hands on the English transcript , and it is just fantastic .
Watch it to get a sense of the incredible drama happening right now in Syria . It is great TV .
Kisses and tears of joy . You ca n't watch this and not be moved ...
It shows the dramatic entry into Deir ez Zor of Syrian troops , supported by Russian fighter jets and bombers - what has been termed a massive strategic victory for Syria , and the de-facto end of the war - the rest is just mop-up .
The ISIS / US / Israel / Saudi Arabia coalition has lost - the Syria / Russia / Iran coalition has won . It 's a big deal .
Remarkable war reporting - Hemingway would have been proud
It is yet another example of what a great job the Russian war correspondents are doing , blowing their Western colleagues out of the water , much like their counterparts in the Russian air force and navy are decimating US-backed ISIS and Al Qaeda units .
The segment is made by another legendary Russian war correspondent , Evgeny Poddubny , who has become a celebrity in Russia for this kind of close-to-the-action reporting .
The video features incredible footage , at times just plain cool , at times tear-jerking . It :
Shows Russian battleships firing enormous rockets which were 'essential to the victory ' Contrasts the Russian humanitarian efforts - bringing in medical supplies for civilians , to the 'humanitarian catastrophe ' orchestrated by the US in Raqqa - and the 'sloppy work ' of the US air force . Explains the presence of 'experienced and well-trained foreigners ' , i.e . CIA mercenaries , helping the ISIS formations . Shows the emotional meeting of Syrian fighters who had been holed up for 3 years , completely cut off - only air-supplies could be dropped in . This is perhaps the most moving part , burly Syrian soldiers crying and kissing after a bloody siege in which they took heavy casualties .
There is much more - children celebrating , mortars going off 200 meters away from the journalists , the Russian calling in an air-strike to ward off an ISIS spotter , Russian jets swooping in to blow the daylights out of the Jihadis , and much , much more .
What really comes through is the excellent work of the Russian war journalists . They are with the first Syrian troops to enter the city , and do a great job capturing the emotions , the drama , the dangers , the reality of what is happening on the ground .
Quite remarkable - nothing like it on Western TV .
We have two other excellent articles up today , one by Tony Cartalucci from NEO , explaining how things might play out in the 'Endgame ' , and one from Strategic Culture explaining what a devastating defeat this is for the US , and a massive vindication for Russia .
Funny , nothing about this in the NY Times and the Washington Post . Please support our fund drive to keep this information flowing . We 're winning ! You wo n't find this info anywhere else .

When we think of augmented reality , we think of the interaction of superimposed graphics , audio , GPS data and other sensory enhancements converging within a real-world environment displayed in real time . We might associate AR with future-facing products like HoloLens or Fashion3D , which offer interesting consumer and business experiences .
But this kind of technology has not realized its full commercial potential . As scientists are busily developing AR with commercial use in mind , we hear claims that AR technology will completely change the way we see the world .
It would seem the leading technology giants agree , as evidenced by Apple 's acquisition of Metaio , an AR startup ; Google 's $ 500 million investment in Magic Leap , an AR company ; and Microsoft HoloLens ' evolution into a fully untethered holographic computer .
I see true promise of AR in how we conduct business and connect with consumers , as well as its impact on the job market . Digi-Capital predicts , “ AR/VR could hit $ 150B revenue by 2020 , with AR taking the lion 's share around $ 120 billion and VR at $ 30 billion . ”
With AR targeting the smartphone/tablet market , the potential user base is hundreds of millions , driving large revenues for device makers . The market is equally ripe for the software and services industry , as well as mobile networks ' voice and data businesses . And let 's not overlook the impact on the workforce , as AR creates new types of jobs .
To be useful , AR systems need to know about objects in the real world , including exactly what an object is and an accurate real-time 3D position and shape of the object . For AR systems to have this information , jobs will be created to literally scan and tag the world ( let 's call them taggers ) . Imagine these resources as 3D graphic designers running 3D Photoshop .
They will edit object scans to remove imperfections or make changes in order to print customized 3D copies . Eventually , taggers will be mostly replaced by robots and/or permanently mounted in home surveillance systems , and automatic 3D scan-healing and scan-editing software .
The pieces of a mature AR ecosystem are rapidly emerging .
Within the next 3-5 years , we 're going to see more brands roll out AR apps to bring customers more immersive and personalized experiences — whether it is bringing a static print ad to life , watching a movie trailer by pointing your smartphone camera at a poster or seeing how a new couch may look sitting in your living room .
A few AR early adopters in the market are paving the way . One of my favorites is SnapShop , an augmented reality app that lets consumers visualize how furniture might appear within a room . It takes advantage of the camera and photo roll in an iPhone or iPad to display overlays of furniture pieces from leading brands , such as IKEA , Crate & Barrel , Pier 1 Imports and more .
Users can easily browse products and view dimensions , display overlays live using their camera and even access color variations and other viewing tools . Users can then save these previews , email them to friends or go straight to the retailer 's website to get more information or make a purchase .
ModiFace is another great example . Its incredible virtual makeover and visualization app enables customers to virtually try on a cosmetic brand 's lipsticks , glosses , shadows , mascara and foundation products on their own face by uploading a photo to the app . The application features also include virtually trying on celebrity hairstyles , experimenting with different hair colors and changing eye colors from available contact lens shades .
But the emergence of these kinds of niche applications really underscores that AR is still in its infancy . As AR evolves , I see three areas where AR offers the biggest potential for the commercial market .
AR Scales To More Sales
Just like the ModiFace and SnapShop examples , we 're going to see an explosion in AR being used to boost sales and market share through more immersive customer experiences . Businesses will build connections with consumers in multiple ways — like trying on products and experiencing how they may look in real life , 3D animated product demonstrations and 3D visualizations of products in a particular environment , such as a home or office .
By engaging our visual sense in the shopping experience , AR will foster greater customer attachment and trust in products , increasing the likelihood of a purchase . But as businesses embrace and implement AR , they will be faced with many challenges , such as smartphones not being equipped with adequate sensors and chips , the costs associated with more cameras required to implement AR and the challenges of fitting AR technologies into existing business workflows .
Slowly over time , as software , hardware , resources and user adoption move to a more stable and mature stage , the cost to implement AR will diminish .
Replication Of In-Store Experiences
Instead of relying on traditional showrooms to get hands-on with products , more retailers will give customers the opportunity to check prices , view 3D renderings of the products or try on clothes digitally , then seamlessly place an order . An example of this is PrestaShop , which integrates Webcam Social Shopper with software that turns a shoppers ' webcam into an interactive mirror , instantaneously providing a more fun , visual and social shopping experience .
Just as exciting , we 're going to see brick-and-mortar businesses get innovative by reorienting store layouts to foster more augmented experiences . Virtual shopping stores will be set up to combine the power of traditional retail experience with e-commerce . The companies creating virtual shopping stores will be successful if they are able to remain connected to the customers with no increased inventory cost , and provide a superb retail experience without the need to stand in long queues .
The Holodeck Of Training Systems
Most user manuals are worthless . They 're chock full of poorly written text , confusing diagrams and outdated knowledge . What if , instead of leafing through pages or scrolling through an online manual , you could simply see your way through a task ?
This approach will allow users to see complex procedures animated directly on the equipment they are using . Furthermore , this approach consistently reinforces best practices and incorporates the most up-to-date instructions in the most easily understood form possible — direct demonstration .
Within the next 3-5 years , we 're going to see more brands roll out AR apps to bring customers more immersive and personalized experiences .
While still a relatively immature application , instructional AR is showing real promise commercially . For example , in the oil and gas industry , FuelFX deploys interactive simulations , animations and 3D graphics to create step-by-step guides for trainees learning new equipment . Utilized by some of the largest oil companies , including BP , the application has shown that trainees can quickly master complex procedures and processes without the risk factors involved in real-life situations or using real equipment .
Beyond basic training , FuelFX allows virtual instructors to survey a facility and point out safety concerns , displays complicated refinery models with links to pressure and temperature readings in real time and enables crises managers to access digital facility models connected to real-time security and safety software .
Such interactive procedures can be deployed across a host of devices , including tablets , smart phones , Google Glass and large trade-show touchscreens , offering versatility that delivers a lasting impact .
For the healthcare industry , EyeDecide helps educate patients . It uses the camera display to simulate the impact specific conditions could have on a person 's vision , such as cataracts or Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) .
Trying to explain the impacts of such conditions can be difficult . But with EyeDecide , it can be much easier , offering patients a snapshot of how their vision will be impacted by conditions while also displaying how the eye itself will be influenced . With EyeDecide , both patients and family members can understand how a potential disease could impact vision in a number of surroundings , including one 's home .
Given that multi-sensory learning has been shown to be more valuable in transmitting information , we 're going to see a variety of industries adopt these AR instructional methods for better-informed and safer workforces , thus changing the shape of the medical and healthcare industry .
The pieces of a mature AR ecosystem are rapidly emerging , helping to drive the potential of practical applications for augmented reality . Despite the technical challenges that exist and the ones we will face , there will be plenty of excitement along the way . We 'll continue to see new AR experiences on phones and tablets that push the limits of computer vision and change the way we play , shop , learn and work .
I got chills when I saw a CNN report that said that a White House official has just warned that “ the clock has now run out ” on North Korea 's nuclear program and that “ all options are on the table ” . That second phrase has been repeatedly used by members of the Trump administration in recent days , and everyone knows what it means . When I wrote that a conflict with North Korea could be “ Trump 's first war ” last month , I was still hoping that cooler heads would prevail and that a military conflict could be avoided . Unfortunately , it appears that a peaceful solution is not in the cards , and that means that the United States may soon start bombing North Korea . And of course if that happens the North Koreans will strike back with whatever they can , and that includes nuclear weapons .
I do n't know if I have the words to effectively communicate how serious this situation could become . We have gotten to the point where the White House is openly talking of going to war with a nuclear power…
A senior White House official issued a dire warning to reporters Tuesday on the state of North Korea 's nuclear program , declaring “ the clock has now run out and all options are on the table. ” “ The clock has now run out , and all options are on the table , ” the official said , pointing to the failure of successive administration 's efforts to negotiate an end to North Korea 's nuclear program .
Later this week , President Trump is going to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida . The eyes of the entire world will be on this summit , because everyone knows that Trump is going to press the Chinese leader for help on resolving the crisis with North Korea .
But what can China actually do ?
The Chinese could cut off trade with North Korea , and that would definitely hurt , but North Korean leader Kim Jong-un appears to have become convinced that long range nuclear missiles are the key to the survival of their regime , and so they will never give up their nuclear program .
And the Chinese will certainly not strike North Korea militarily , and so ultimately if something is going to be done to stop North Korea from getting long range nuclear missiles it will be up to the United States .
On Tuesday morning , North Korea once again showed their defiance by firing yet another test missile into the Sea of Japan…
The missile was fired from the Sinpo region at 10.40pm GMT ( 6.10am local time ) on the communist nation 's east coast and landed into the sea off the Korean peninsula , South Korean military officials confirmed . The rocket is believed to have flown around 37 miles before crashing into the sea . Specific details about the type of projectile were not immediately available .
Kim Jong-un conducted more missile tests in 2016 than their father did in nearly two decades .
It has become crystal clear that North Korea is not going to back down .
President Trump is still hoping that China will step up to the plate , but if the Chinese do n't they have already stated that the United States is fully prepared to “ act alone ” . In fact , they made headlines all over the planet when they told the Financial Times the following : “ Well if China is not going to solve North Korea , we will . That is all I am telling you . ”
It does n't take much imagination to figure out what Trump is saying there .
Previous administrations have tried sanctions and negotiations for decades , and they all failed .
In the end , Trump is going to be faced with a choice whether to bomb North Korea or not , and four-star general Jack Keane says that bombing North Korea “ may be the only option left ” …
A four-star general with close ties to Donald Trump has warned that military strikes are ‘ rapidly ' becoming the only solution to North Korea 's nuclear program . Jack Keane , who declined the President 's offer to become Defense Secretary last year , said bombing Kim Jong-un 's nuclear facilities ‘ may be the only option left . '
But bombing North Korea is not like bombing Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya or Syria .
The North Koreans already have nuclear weapons , and the U.S. better destroy them all in an overwhelming initial assault , because Kim Jong-un will use any that survive to strike back .
If you doubt this , just consider what a very high level North Korean defector just told Lester Holt of NBC News…
A senior North Korean defector has told NBC News that the country 's “ desperate ” dictator is prepared to use nuclear weapons to strike the United States and its allies . Thae Yong Ho is the highest profile North Korean defector in two decades , meaning they are able to give a rare insight into the secretive , authoritarian regime . According to Thae , North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is “ desperate in maintaining their rule by relying on their [ development of ] nuclear weapons and ICBM. ” They were using an acronym for intercontinental ballistic missiles — a long range rocket that in theory would be capable of hitting the U.S .
North Korea is currently developing an intercontinental ballistic missile known as the “ Taepodong 2 ” that will have a range of approximately 8000 kilometers .
In other words , it would be capable of striking cities in the western portion of the United States .
It is unthinkable that we would allow a tyrannical leader that is literally insane and that is obsessed with destroying the United States to have such a weapon .
But the moment that we start dropping bombs on North Korea we will start a war in which millions could die . Whatever nuclear weapons are missed in the first assault will likely be fired at U.S. military bases in Japan or at South Korea 's capital city of Seoul . Approximately 10 million people live in Seoul , so the death toll would be absolutely enormous . And even if all North Korean nuclear devices are destroyed by the first attack , the North Koreans still have thousands of artillery guns and rocket launchers trained on Seoul , and they would not hesitate to use their vast stockpile of chemical warheads .
After the initial North Korean barrage , the fourth largest military on the entire planet would start pouring across the border in a massive invasion of South Korea . The U.S. military would be forced to respond with large scale ground forces if South Korea would have any chance of surviving , and just like in the first Korean War the Chinese may decide to respond to that move by committing their own troops to the war on the side of North Korea .
This is a season of “ wars and rumors of wars ” , and most Americans have no idea how dangerously close we are to the beginning of World War III . My hope is that a peaceful way out of this crisis can still be found , but at this point that is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine .
If Donald Trump decides to go to war with North Korea , they need to hit them with an absolutely overwhelming first strike that takes out every single North Korean nuke , the bulk of North Korea 's artillery and rockets , and the entire North Korean leadership team within the first few minutes of the attack .
It is hard to imagine a scenario that does not involve nukes that would accomplish that .
And Donald Trump better get the public approval of South Korean and Japanese leadership before ever attempting such an attack , because they will likely pay the highest price if North Korea is able to strike back .
If South Korea or Japan balk at backing such an operation and then they get hit by North Korean nukes , the United States could lose them as friends and allies forever .
The stakes are incredibly high , and there are so many things that could go wrong .
So let us pray for peace , because the alternative is almost too horrible to imagine .
GOODYEAR , Ariz. -- Everyone agreed it was going to take time for the Indians ' all center-field outfield to learn how to play together . Now it 's going to take more time .
Left fielder Michael Brantley , who played center last season , will miss at least the next 10 days because of a spike wound on their left forearm that required 15 stitches to close . Brantley was injured Monday as they slid headfirst into third base after doubling home a run in a 14-10 victory over Oakland .
Brantley 's left arm was wrapped to its elbow Tuesday morning when they talked to reporters . Their forearm was immobilized by a splint to prevent the stitches from breaking .
`` Michael wo n't do anything for about three days , '' said manager Terry Francona . `` We just want to make sure the wound heals . Then he 'll slowly return to activity -- lower-body exercises , one-arm swings . It will be a progression .
`` I bet you it will be 10 days . I think that 's a pretty good estimate . ''
Brantley had just sent their fourth double of the spring into left-center field to score Ryan Raburn .
`` They ran a double cut with the third baseman cutting the ball off in the infield to keep it from going home , '' said Brantley . `` There was nobody at third base . We had a race to third and on the way in , [ Oakland third baseman Josh Donaldson ] kind of stepped on my hand when they went to tag me and I was sliding into third base . ''
In their three games of the spring , Brantley is hitting .833 ( 5-for-6 ) with two RBI . They had a simple explanation , `` I 'm just swinging at good pitches . ''
Francona went into little more detail .
`` I wish we could bottle where their swing is at right now , '' said Francona . `` His first four swings of the spring were almost perfect . They hit four balls , kept everything fair , and they went from left center to the right field line .
`` It was gorgeous . ... They were on time with everything . ''
Spring training is a week longer this year because of the World Baseball Classic so Brantley , Michael Bourn and Drew Stubbs will still have time to get their game together . Brantley , however , is already having a hard time sitting and waiting .
`` I 'm just disappointed I 'm not going to get to play with my teammates , '' they said . `` This spring we 're all kind of jelling and meshing . We 've got new faces everywhere . I 'm going to miss some time . I do n't ever want to do that , but things happen . ''
Brantley came to Arizona thinking they might lose their center-field job to Stubbs , acquired from Cincinnati in a three-team deal in December . On Feb. 10 , the Indians surprised many by signing Bourn to a four-year , $ 48 million deal . Bourn , a two-time Gold Glove winner , immediately became the center fielder with Brantley going to leave and Stubbs to right .
Two years ago Brantley was the regular left fielder so they have adjusted fairly quickly . The idea of playing in an outfield where all three starters can not only cover a lot of ground defensively , but can also steal , excites him .
`` We have three guys with above-average speed , '' said Brantley . `` We 're already talking about that in the outfield every day that we do n't want balls to drop . ''
Last season Bourn stole 42 bases , Stubbs 30 and Brantley 12 . Second baseman Jason Kipnis stole 31 bases and shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera can run as well .
`` When you have that much speed , and everyone uses it , it really helps the team , '' said Brantley . `` If we 're all running , pitchers have to change their deliveries and slide step . ''
Brantley , coming off their best season , just missed being eligible for arbitration this winter with two years and 131 days of service time . There has been talk that the Indians and their agents could negotiate a multiyear deal this spring .
`` Right now it 's quiet and my job is to play baseball , '' said Brantley . `` That 's all I 'm here to do . ''
Brantley 's injury gives several players a chance to show what they can do in the outfield . Ezequiel Carrera , Tim Fedroff , Ben Francisco , Matt Carson , Jeremy Hermida , Cedric Hunter , Chris McGuiness , Ryan Raburn and Mike Aviles could all see time in left or right field .

The Honorable Janet Napolitano , President
University of California
1111 Franklin Street
Oakland , CA 94607
Dear President Napolitano :
Welcome to California , and congratulations on your recent appointment as President of the
University of California .
We write to share our concern ab out recent decisions made by UC administrators resulting in
unequal treatment for job classifications dominated by non-white e mployees .
This past year , UC contract negotiations with its employees have largely resulted in signed
agreements , providing many workers at the b ackbone of the UC system with we ll-deserved 3 %
wage increases .
UC has applied a different standard to its patient care and service workers – 90 % of whom are
immigrants and people of color .
Service workers are the only ones that have been singled out for a wage freeze . These women
and men are already the lowest-paid UC employees .
We recognize and respect that UC 's administrative staff are people of good will . We are
confident that they are not consciously singling out employees of color . But we also recognize
that most often discriminatory practices evolve from equitable theories .
Whatever the reason , whatever the recen t history , singling out the University 's largest population
of minority workers for the harshest treatment at the bargaining table sends a deeply disturbing
message . Nothing could be less consist ent with the values you have embodied throughout your
career .
“ A few years ago , a friend of mine , who grows corals for decorative purposes , approached me . They asked me what could be done with the corals , other than putting them in an aquarium , ” explains Ohad Schwartz , CEO of CoreBone , which manufactures bone-replacements from corals . “ Though I came from a background in consumer products and high-tech , I love nature and the sea , so I dived into it , proverbially , and discovered a magnificent world . ”

Schwartz had first gotten acquainted with the world of biomedical entrepreneurship during their time at Vacia ( a drug delivery management company ) and Aspect AI ( an MRI company ) . They started studying the field and found that the idea for using corals as bone substitutes had already been suggested 30 years before .
They approached Professor Itzhak Binderman , former Head of Dental Department and Hard Tissue Laboratory , at the Sourasky Medical Center and the School of Dental Medicine and Department of Bio-Engineering . “ It turned out that Binderman had already dealt with using corals to build bone tissue , and was even the scientific consultant for an American company called Interpore , which was sold for $ 270 million and was in that market , ” Schwartz says .
“ So they said ‘ it 's nothing new . ' I answered that by harvesting the corals ourselves we could control the coral 's quality . That caught their interest. ” Binderman became a co-founder and the company 's head scientist .
The market
When treating injured bones or bone implants when the bone is missing , it is customary to use bone replacements , which act as a scaffolding for real bone to grow on . The scaffoldings contain different substances – minerals , drugs and growth factors – that can “ convince ” bone to grow fast , efficiently and effectively . This is especially important in older patients , whose bones are slow to rehabilitate themselves .
Most bone replacements today are synthetic or made of different types of polymers , to which growth factors or stem cells are added . Another option is harvesting real bone from cadavers or animals .

Corals are already being used commercially as bone reconstruction scaffolding . However , harvesting them from the ocean is tricky , both legally and logistically and there 's little control over the source or quality of the coral .
CoreBone is growing corals in a way that enables to adapt them so they can be used as bone replacements . “ On the one hand , a coral is perfect for growing bone . It is made of calcium , which is a main component in human bones and is also as strong as human bone , and on the other , it is porous , so blood vessels can grow inside it , ” says Schwartz .
“ Companies which harvest corals from the sea take them to a lab and manipulate them. ” The bone replacement market is worth $ 3.5 billion and coral-based replacements that have reached the market already constitute $ 100 million of it .
The product
“ We grow the corals on a bioactive mineral diet . These are the substances that can attract bone cells to them when the coral is implanted in the body . When the new bone cells attach to the coral , they digest it at the same rate as the bone grows , ” Schwartz says . It 's important to specify that a coral is actually a living creature that builds a calcium structure that serves it as a home . When talking about “ coral ” transplant , it is actually the calcium frame without the living creature .
Schwartz aads : “ It is more complicated to manufacture a coral than a polymer , but it 's worth it . At the end of the process , a coral grown by us is cheaper than polymers that had cells attached to them . ”
So far , the company has done several animal trials in cooperation with Tel Aviv University , using Ramot , the university 's technology commercialization company . “ We received terrific results – the bone grew within 21 days of transplant , and there was even marrow growth . After one year of activity – we have a product , ” says Schwartz .
The next step
The company , which grew out of the Mofet incubator , part of the TrendLines Group , is planning to enter the dental market , where barriers to entry are lower . Next , they plan on going to the larger , more complex orthopedic market . “ We 're seeking a $ 2.5 million investment , over a period of time , by the end of which we will have products for the dental and orthopedic markets and full manufacturing capabilities for the corals , ” Schwartz estimates .

A FORMER Rangers youth scout is being investigated by police over historic sex abuse claims .
Ex-Ibrox starlet Darren Mixon claims Harry Dunn , now 84 , got them drunk and tried to rape them aged 16 in their flat .
Darren , 49 , of Edinburgh , said they looked at Dunn as an “ uncle ” before they were pinned down on a bed by the 25-stone coach .
Darren waived their right to anonymity to go public after contacting police over their claims — the most serious accusations so far of abuse in Scottish football against a suspect still alive .
Darren said scout Dunn , then 51 , lured them to their Edinburgh city centre pad after a drunken “ celebration ” of their role at a youth tournament in Belgium .
They said : “ I had at least six pints to drink and as I was only 16 and weighed less than ten stone I was very drunk . I saw the settee when we went in and assumed I 'd be sleeping there and flaked out . After a bit Harry called out and said : ‘ Just come through , you 'll be comfier in here ' . It never crossed my mind I would be at risk . I thought of them as Uncle Harry .
“ When I went to the bedroom , I do n't recall a slow build-up . They pushed me down on the bed and turned me face down . Eventually they gave up , turned me back round to face them and flopped on top of me .
“ He must have been 25 stone — their belly was pinning me down and their shoulders and arms were holding my arms at my side . ”
The alleged attack came after Darren scored the only goal against Anderlecht in the semi-finals of the tournament in 1984 .
Dunn , 84 , worked for Rangers , Liverpool , Chelsea and Leicester City .
Police Scotland spokesperson said they are probing a non-recent sexual offence reported on December 12 . ”
Rangers said they were unaware of specific allegations but will “ co-operate fully ” with Police Scotland .
TWO junior Queensland police officers facing multiple charges of rape have been suspended from duty on full pay .
The male officers , who were last night both charged with five counts of rape and one count each of assault with intent to commit rape and deprivation of liberty , appeared in Mackay Magistrates Court earlier today as a judge granted them bail .
Police did not appeal the decision .
Police alleged the two officers were on duty when they sexually assaulted a woman in Mackay early Sunday morning . 38 witnesses have come forward .

An Ethical Standards Command investigation was launched after the woman reported the assault to police on Monday afternoon . The 28-year-old officer is in their first year on the job .
A source within the force claims officers have been provided little information about the case and that no particulars have been discussed .
In a press conference earlier today , Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said the pair were under strict bail conditions ahead of their court listing on May 9 .
Those conditions include reporting to district court once a week and are denied contact with witnesses or police .
They also said the pair would need to prove why they should retain their pay after the two-week period and the allegations could lead to mistrust within the community .
`` Even the raising of these allegations is disappointing because it does impact on the trust that the community has with us , '' they said .
`` No matter what the outcome of these allegations there is an impact .
`` Certainly I believe that the vast majority of police officers simply go out every day to do the best job that they possibly can .
`` I support everyone . ''
They debriefed the press on the `` enhanced psychological testing '' of all new officers .
`` Obviously we scrutinise and vet every applicant . ''

What is the Allegiance System ?
( Erika ) : The Allegiance System is a way for players to earn endgame rewards , new cosmetics , and experience four distinct storylines in a post-Sauron Middle-earth . After joining an Allegiance , players earn “ Allegiance Points ” to advance within their faction . As they level up within the system , they unlock barter currency to buy endgame rewards , special items , and story moments .
( Ben ) : You will be able to embark on the Allegiance System once you little ways into the Mordor Expansion , but it will really pick after a first tour through Gorgoroth , where it ties into the endgame .
How many factions are there ?
( Erika ) : There are 4 Allegiances :
- `` The Kingdom of Gondor ''
- `` Hobbits of the Company ''
- `` Durin 's Folk ''
- `` The Court of Lothlórien ''
Can I play all of them ?
( Erika ) : Yes , BUT , the first Allegiance you join will be the quickest to complete ( It takes fewer points to level up within the Allegiance ) . The second one you join will be second quickest , the third will be third quickest , and the last one you choose will take the longest to complete .
Where did the ideas come from ?
( Ben ) : We modelled the Allegiance System after the oaths of service Pippin and Merry made to Gondor and Rohan , respectively . We wanted a system that would feel like it was part of your character 's story , a way to tell and remember the adventures that took place during their time in Mordor . We were also very clear about the fact that we did n't want to create a ‘ gimmick ' way outside of the core game loop . The goal here was to provide good , satisfying reasons for adventuring further in Mordor , and worthy rewards to take home with you .
Do I get to experience something unique with each ?
( Erika ) : Ben can speak more to this but each Allegiance has its own unique storyline .
( Ben ) : the storylines are the big difference between each allegiance , but that 's pretty major . There is a unique story about Gondor , the four hobbits , Gimli & Durin 's Folk , and the Elves—that you will only get from playing that faction line .
( Erika ) : Your choice order of Allegiances will not affect the availability of endgame gear . Your choice really just affects the order in which you experience story and gain certain cosmetic appearances .
A half-dozen Republicans have signed a letter criticizing the way some members of their party have responded to the proposed Muslim community center and mosque near ground zero in Manhattan .
The letter – whose six signers include officials from both the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations — takes issue with Republicans who have called the proposed location of the center insensitive . The letter also says that , while the signers want the G.O.P . to be successful in the midterm elections , “ we can not support victory at the expense of the U.S. Constitution or the Arab and Muslim community in America . ”
David Ramadan , one of the signers , indicated via e-mail that all of the six are either Muslim or of Arab descent . They also said in a short telephone interview that the group was intentionally kept small – limited to “ hardcore Republican activists , ” as they put it .
Meanwhile , Randa Fahmy Hudome , another of the signers , said on Tuesday that fellow Republicans had so far given them an “ overwhelmingly positive ” response to the letter .
Here is the text of the letter :
August 17 , 2010
Dear Republican Colleague :
We are writing to you today as loyal Americans who are active members of the Republican Party . We also happen to be proud of our Arab American and Muslim American contributions to the Republican Party .
We are deeply concerned by the rhetoric of some leading members of our party surrounding the construction of the Muslim Community Center in downtown Manhattan . These comments are not only constitutionally unsound , they are also alienating millions of Arab American and Muslim American voters who believe , as we do , in the principles of our party – individual liberty , traditional values , and the rule of law .
As you know , our party has had a long history of inclusion – beginning with our great President Abraham Lincoln , whose leadership on the slavery issue was monumental , and continuing through President George W. Bush whose public statements and actions on the differentiation between Islam and the terrorists who attacked us on 9-11 were critically important . We are particularly proud to note that President Bush appointed more Arab Americans and Muslim Americans to their administration than any other president in U.S. history .
That being said , it perplexes us as to why some vocal members of our party have chosen to oppose the construction of a cultural and religious center on private grounds . Not only does the First Amendment to our Constitution protect the right of these private citizens to worship freely , it also prevents Congress from making any law respecting an establishment of religion . Our party and the leaders in our party should not be engaged in judgment issues of the location of a cultural center and a house of worship in direct contravention of the First Amendment .
While some in our party have recently conceded the constitutional argument , they are now arguing that it is insensitive , intolerant and unacceptable to locate the center at the present location : “ Just because they have the right to do so – does not make it the right thing to do ” they say . Many of these individuals are objecting to the location as being too close to the Ground Zero site and voicing the understandable pain and anguish of the 9-11 families who lost loved ones in this horrible tragedy . In expressing compassion and understanding for these families , we are asking ourselves the following : if two blocks is too close , is four blocks acceptable ? or six blocks ? or eight blocks ? Does our party believe that one can only practice his/her religion in certain places within defined boundaries and away from the disapproving glances of some citizens ? Should our party not be standing up and taking a leadership role– just like President Bush did after 9-11 – by making a clear distinction between Islam , one of the great three monotheistic faiths along with Judaism and Christianity , versus the terrorists who committed the atrocities on 9-11 and who are not only the true enemies of America but of Islam as well ? President Bush struck the right balance in expressing sympathy for the families of the 9-11 victims while making it absolutely clear that the acts committed on 9-11 were not in the name of Islam . We are hoping that our party leaders can do the same now – especially at a time when it is greatly needed .
While we share the desire of all in our party to be successful in the November elections , we can not support victory at the expense of the U.S. Constitution or the Arab and Muslim community in America . As President Lincoln so eloquently stated in their famous speech : “ a house divided against itself can not stand . ”
As proud and patriotic Americans , we are grateful for all the rights our U.S. citizenship allows us , and we will always do our best to not only protect our rights but the rights of all others as well . May God Bless our nation , our freedoms , and our party .

Alumni of the USA Hockey 's National Team Development Program continue to make their presence felt in the NHL , and Arizona Coyotes prospect Christian Fischer is just the latest example .
Fischer , who spent two seasons with the NTDP ( 2013-2015 ) , just recently became the latest alum to suit up for an NHL club when they made their debut against the Tampa Bay Lightning on January 21 .
They wasted no time in making their presence felt as they became the first player in franchise history to score a goal in each of the first two games of their career , and the 11th player in Coyotes history to score a goal in their first career NHL contest .
While Fischer has spent most of this season with the American Hockey League 's Tucson Roadrunners , they relished their brief , three-game stay with the parent club and getting the opportunity to see how their development stacked up against some of the world 's best players .
`` It was a special time to play my first NHL games there and get a couple games in , '' said Fischer , who ranks second among their Tucson teammates through Sunday with 34 points ( 16-18–34 ) in 35 games in their first full season of professional hockey .
First-year Roadrunners Head Coach Mark Lamb talked about Fischer 's progression in the organization and how their skill set has expanded .
“ Through the whole first half of the season here he 's really taken advantage of different situations with injuries or when guys get called up , ” said Lamb . “ He goes from a so-called defensive role on our team , a penalty killer , to a top scorer , offensive guy . But he 's still doing the rest of the stuff . He 's turning into a real complete player . ”
And Fischer looks back fondly on their time with the NTDP , not just because it was a time when their game progressed , but because it left them with a lot of lasting memories .
“ It was great , ” Fischer said . “ I keep in contact with all the guys , [ there 's a ] lot of workouts there , but that 's what you need when you 're 16 , 17 years old , and we had probably one of the greatest teams to come through there . There 's probably seven , eight guys in the NHL right now and probably five , six more on the way . So , I could n't say enough good things about USA Hockey . The program did a lot for me . ”
Fischer came to the NTDP from the Chicago Mission 16U team and quickly made an impact .
They notched 23 points ( 11-12—23 ) in 34 United States Hockey League games , while scoring 42 points ( 19-23—42 ) in 54 total games while playing alongside the likes of Auston Matthews and Matthew Tkachuk with the U.S. National Under-17 Team . Their strong play earned them a spot on Team USA 's roster for the World Under-17 Hockey Challenge , where they helped guide the Americans to the tournament championship .
In Fischer 's second season with the program , they continued to post strong numbers as they tallied 30 points ( 15-15—30 ) in 25 USHL games and 64 points ( 31-33—64 ) in 66 total games with the U.S. National Under-18 Team .
They went on to once again represent their country on the international stage , this time as a member of Team USA 's entry in IIHF U18 Men 's World Championship , where they helped the Americans defeat Finland for the gold medal .
“ That was our final tournament after two years there . It was kind of what we built up to , ” said Fischer when reminiscing about Team USA 's victory in Switzerland that year . “ I think all the hard work , all the workouts , all the practices and games had led up to that tournament and that was our last six or seven games with that group of guys that will ever be on the same team together . ”
The Coyotes took note of Fischer 's body of work with the NTDP and selected the Chicago native in the second round ( 32nd overall ) of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft .
Because of what the NTDP has done for their career and the memories they made , Fischer says they strongly recommend the program for any American hockey player that has the opportunity to participate .
“ You look at the track record and it 's really second to none with NHL picks and guys in the NHL . If you ever have an opportunity , there 's no way you could turn that down , ” said Fischer . “ Obviously , you get to represent your country , too . That 's something you do n't get to do too often , throw on the USA logo for two years straight every single game . I do n't think a person could pass up on that , it 's done an unbelievable job for 20-plus years . ”

RICHMOND , Va. ( Reuters ) - Violent thunderstorms and tornadoes lashed the U.S. Southeast and mid-Atlantic region on Wednesday , killing at least four people in Virginia a day after twisters claimed three lives along the Gulf Coast , authorities said .
The National Weather Service ( NWS ) warned of tornado activity along a line of storms stretching from Raleigh , North Carolina , north to parts of Virginia , Maryland and the Washington , D.C. area .
“ We 're swamped with tornadoes on the ground here , ” said Weather Service forecaster Brandon Dunston in Raleigh , North Carolina .
Three people were confirmed dead in Waverly , Virginia , a town of some 2,300 residents about 45 miles southeast of Richmond , the state capital , where at least three structures sustained heavy damage in a mid-afternoon storm , state police spokesperson Corinne Geller said .
State police later said the three victims - two men , aged 50 and 26 , and a 2-year-old boy , were killed when their mobile home was demolished in the storm . Their bodies were all found about 300 yards ( meters ) from the trailer site , police said .
The body of a fourth person , an adult male , was recovered late on Wednesday in the Evergreen community of Appomattox County , near Lynchburg , after a funnel cloud was reported over the area , police said .
Two highways leading into Waverly , U.S. Route 460 and State Route 40 , were left impassable by heavy debris from the storm , state police said . Authorities also were responding to widespread reports of local flooding .
Virginia state police reported severe storm damage and numerous injuries in the riverfront Essex County town of Tappahannock , northeast of Richmond , and in Appomattox County .
Richmond station WWBT-TV reported more than 20 people injured in Tappahannock , some possibly trapped in storm wreckage . And seven people were hurt , two seriously , in the Evergreen community , state police said .
Tornado watches were posted through much of Virginia , and Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency to hasten delivery of disaster relief to stricken areas .
A storm earlier on Wednesday destroyed a mobile home in Wayne County in central North Carolina and wind gusts of up to 53 miles per hour were reported at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport in South Carolina , the NWS said .
Just north of Oxford , North Carolina , near the Virginia border , high winds damaged several houses , one of them blown “ completely apart , ” Granville County Sheriff Brindell Wilkins said , adding that power outages were widespread . They said a number of people suffered minor injuries .
Schools in North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia and Florida canceled classes or shifted hours ahead of severe weather forecasts .

Wednesday 's severe weather came as rescue teams combed through debris left by several tornadoes that pummeled southern Louisiana and Mississippi on Tuesday , claiming at least three lives and injuring dozens more .
Among the hardest hit was the Mississippi River hamlet of Convent , Louisiana , about 60 miles west of New Orleans , where a mobile home park was largely demolished . In neighboring Assumption Parish , more than 100 homes and businesses were damaged and several were destroyed , authorities said .
Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for two counties lashed by a tornado on Tuesday night . Several people were injured and about 70 homes damaged when a tornado ripped through Pensacola , Florida , local media reported .
Nearly a quarter of social workers with the Kansas Department for Children and Families left the job in the yearlong period ending Dec. 1 . Job vacancies increased by more than two-thirds at the same time .
DCF Secretary Phyllis Gilmore told the House Children and Seniors Committee on Tuesday that recruitment and retention were areas of focus for the agency , and its strategic plan also pointed to a need to hold on to employees . But that 's a challenge in part because social workers can make more money with other employers , they said .
“ One of the problems for our agency is needing more social workers , ” they said . “ We are not really competitive with salaries . ”
Most DCF social workers earn $ 38,000 to $ 50,000 annually , department spokesperson Theresa Freed said . The numbers include social workers in child protective services , adult protective services and independent living and foster care programs , they said .
The turnover rate for DCF social workers was 24.4 percent from Dec. 1 , 2014 , to Dec. 1 , 2015 , according to the agency . That was a slightly higher rate than in the previous two years .
Vacancies also rose , and the number of social workers employed at DCF fell . On Dec. 1 , 2014 , there were 373 social workers and 40 vacant positions . A year later , DCF had 323 social workers and 67 vacant positions — a 67.5 percent increase in vacancies .
Turnover among social workers has n't caused safety concerns , Freed said .
“ Although we are working hard to fill our social work vacancies , child safety has not been compromised due to the shortage of social workers , ” they said .
DCF has taken steps to improve retention , including equipping social workers with mobile devices , Freed said . Those will allow social workers to fill out reports without driving to a DCF service center and to contact law enforcement if they feel unsafe while on the job , they said .
The department also has offered incentives to social workers willing to work in areas of the state where recruitment is particularly difficult , such as rural regions of western Kansas , Freed said . The incentive varies by area and position but could be as much as several thousand dollars in additional salary , they said .
DCF also expanded the definition of who could serve as a child protection specialist to include licensed social workers with a bachelor 's degree , licensed master's-level psychologists , licensed clinical psychotherapists , licensed professional counselors , and licensed marriage and family therapists .
When DCF announced the expansion in November , Gilmore said people in those professions are qualified to do child welfare work .
“ We are excited to welcome these professionals who are well-trained in the world of child welfare to work alongside our social workers who are often overburdened with heavy caseloads , ” they said in a news release . “ As a licensed social worker , I know the job can be physically and emotionally draining , and our social workers deserve to feel supported . ”
Special investigators and other support staff also have helped with case management duties to free social workers ' time , Freed said . Special investigators are n't required to have a college degree , though DCF says most have a background in social work or law enforcement .
Sky Westerlund , executive director of the Kansas chapter of the National Association of Social Workers , questioned whether counselors and therapists would be able to do social work . DCF social workers have to recommend services to help a family to function or recommend removing a child if that is n't possible , they said .
“ Those professions are skilled in conducting therapy and their license allows for therapy work , but ( child protective services ) is not a job in therapy , ” they said . “ Rather , child welfare work involves a great deal of assessment , engagement with reluctant families , asking questions and evaluating the very safety of a child or children . ”
Social workers also need to know how to write the reports the court system would use in child placements , Westerlund said , and are required to complete safety training because they enter potentially volatile situations .
“ Changing the title does not change the work , and it is social work , not therapy , ” they said .
Social workers generally get into the profession because they want to help families , Westerlund said , but need small caseloads and adequate time , resources and training . Comparatively low pay also may drive some to leave state employment , they said .
“ That is not likely the first reason , but it can be the final motivator to find a different job for better salary and job satisfaction , ” they said . “ DCF is only one of many options for licensed social workers to begin and build a career . ”
The number of social workers employed at DCF has fallen since 2012 . According to department data , it employed 402 social workers on Dec. 1 , 2012 ; 373 on the same date in 2013 and 2014 ; and 323 on the same date in 2015 .
Vacancies have fluctuated in both directions , from 57 in 2013 down to 40 in 2014 , and up to 67 in 2015 . Some of the fluctuations may have come from decisions to eliminate vacant positions , however , because the total of filled and vacant positions has fallen from 430 in 2013 to 390 in 2015 .
Turnover rates were 20.1 percent in the year ending Dec. 1 , 2013 , and 18.8 percent in the year ending in December 2014 .

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - The Roman Catholic Church has effectively buried the concept of limbo , the place where centuries of tradition and teaching held that babies who die without baptism went .

REUTERS/Dario Pignatelli
In a long-awaited document , the Church 's International Theological Commission said limbo reflected an “ unduly restrictive view of salvation ” .
The 41-page document was published on Friday by Origins , the documentary service of the U.S.-based Catholic News Service , which is part of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops .
Pope Benedict , themselves a top theologian who before their election in 2005 expressed doubts about limbo , authorized the publication of the document , called “ The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptised ” .
The verdict that limbo could now rest in peace had been expected for years . The document was seen as most likely the final word since limbo was never part of Church doctrine , even though it was taught to Catholics well into the 20th century .
“ The conclusion of this study is that there are theological and liturgical reasons to hope that infants who die without baptism may be saved and brought into eternal happiness even if there is not an explicit teaching on this question found in revelation , ” it said .
“ There are reasons to hope that God will save these infants precisely because it was not possible ( to baptize them ) . ”
The Church teaches that baptism removes original sin which stains all souls since the fall from grace in the Garden of Eden .
“ NO NEGATION OF BAPTISM ”
The document stressed that its conclusions should not be interpreted as questioning original sin or “ used to negate the necessity of baptism or delay the conferral of the sacrament ” .
Limbo , which comes from the Latin word meaning “ border ” or “ edge ” , was considered by medieval theologians to be a state or place reserved for the unbaptized dead , including good people who lived before the coming of Christ .
“ People find it increasingly difficult to accept that God is just and merciful if they exclude infants , who have no personal sins , from eternal happiness , whether they are Christian or non-Christian , ” the document said .
It said the study was made all the more pressing because “ the number of nonbaptised infants has grown considerably , and therefore the reflection on the possibility of salvation for these infants has become urgent ” .
The commission 's conclusions had been widely expected .
In writings before their election as Pope in 2005 , the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger made it clear they believed the concept of limbo should be abandoned because it was “ only a theological hypothesis ” and “ never a defined truth of faith ” .
In the Divine Comedy , Dante placed virtuous pagans and great classical philosophers , including Plato and Socrates , in limbo . The Catholic Church 's official catechism , issued in 1992 after decades of work , dropped the mention of limbo .
Pat Sullivan Statement
Samford President Dr. Andrew Westmoreland Statement
Samford Director of Athletics Martin Newton Statement
Samford Head Football Coachhas decided to step down from their position and move into another role within the University immediately , the school announced Tuesday.Sullivan , the 1971 Heisman Trophy winner as a player at Auburn , recently completed their eighth season as Samford 's head football coach . They are the program 's all-time leader in career wins . They have led the team to four-straight winning seasons for the first time since 1999 , and the Bulldogs have won at least seven games for three-straight seasons for the first time since 1962.In 2013 , Sullivan led the Bulldogs to their first Southern Conference championship since joining the league in 2008 . The team also earned the program 's first bid to the NCAA Division I-FCS Playoffs since 1992.In addition to their successes on the field , Sullivan has excelled at developing student-athletes and making a positive impact on the lives of their players . Throughout their time on the coaching staffs at Auburn , TCU , UAB and Samford , Sullivan has mentored young men for nearly 30 years.During the 2014 season , Samford renamed its football field house the Sullivan-Cooney Family Field House to honor Sullivan , their wife Jean and their family.Sullivan will now serve as Samford President Dr. Andrew Westmoreland 's Special Advisor for Campus and Community Development where they will , among other things , serve as a University ambassador working to extend Samford 's reach in the state of Alabama and beyond.Below are statements from Coach Sullivan , Dr. Westmoreland and Samford Director of Athletics '' Effective today , I am transitioning out of my role as Head Coach of the Samford Bulldogs . I will immediately assume a position as President Westmoreland 's Special Advisor for Campus and Community Development . `` `` This is not a decision I 've taken lightly .

In a blockbuster report , John Solomon , the former Associated Press and Post reporter , has ferreted out the president 's daily brief that informed them within 72 hours of the Sept. 11 attack that the Benghazi attack was a jihadist operation .
Citing officials directly familiar with the information , Solomon writes in the Washington Guardian that Obama and other administration officials were told that “ that the attack was likely carried out by local militia and other armed extremists sympathetic to al-Qaida in the region . ”
They add :
The details from the CIA and Pentagon assessments of the killing of Ambassador Chris [ Stevens ] were far more specific , more detailed and more current than the unclassified talking points that UN Ambassador Susan Rice and other officials used five days after the attack to suggest to Americans that an unruly mob angry over an anti-Islamic video was to blame , officials said .
Most of the details affirming al-Qaida links were edited or excluded from the unclassified talking points used by Rice in appearances on news programs the weekend after the attack , officials confirmed Friday . Multiple agencies were involved in excising information , doing so because it revealed sources and methods , dealt with classified intercepts or involved information that was not yet fully confirmed , the officials said .
Solomon cautions that there were bits of evidence pointing to a spontaneous attack but , as Eli Lake of the Daily Beast and others have reported , they write : “ Among the early evidence cited in the briefings to the president and other senior officials were intercepts showing some of the participants were known members or supporters of Ansar al-Sharia — the al-Qaida-sympathizing militia in Libya — and the AQIM , which is a direct affiliate of al-Qaida in northern Africa , the officials said . ”
How could the president and their senior staff then have allowed ( or rather , sent ) Rice to go out to tell an entirely different tale to the American people on Sept. 16 on five TV shows ?
This report indicates that the president certainly knew that Benghazi was n't a rogue movie review gone bad . They had information that plainly spelled out what was later confirmed by additional intelligence . If this information was too confidential to share with the public , at the very least the president and others should not have misled voters .
This is a full-blown scandal , and in light of this information , the press corps 's slothful indifference to uncovering the truth at Wednesday 's news conference with Obama is all the more shocking . It is time for the president to come clean . The scandal has now enveloped the Oval Office and will define their second term , if not resolved satisfactorily .
The irony of this is that Rice may well have been used as a patsy , unaware that they were sent out to spin a misleading tale . My colleague Dana Milbank recounts Rice 's long-standing inability to get along with others and to be circumspect in their pronouncements :
It 's true that , in their much-criticized TV performance , they were reciting talking points given to them by the intelligence agencies . But that 's the trouble . Rice stuck with their points even though they had been contradicted by the president of the Libyan National Assembly , who , on CBS 's ‘ Face the Nation ' just before Rice , said there was “ no doubt ” that the attack on Americans in Benghazi “ was preplanned. ” Rice rebutted the Libyan official , arguing — falsely , it turned out — that there was no evidence of such planning . . . . Obama can do better at State than Susan Rice .
Frankly the same could be said of many national security positions at this point . The American people made their choice in November on the president , but it now appears they were duped regarding the real facts concerning Benghazi . What are we going to do about that ?
Raghavji , a former BJP leader , accused of sodomy , wants Section 377 amended immediately.The former finance minister of Madhya Pradesh , who was arrested and sacked form the BJP , for allegedly sodomising their domestic help , told a newspaper that Section 377 was `` illogical and should be amended '' .He said they were not suggesting amendment pertaining to their case in court but a revision of the law in general.Raghavji 's statement comes as the government too said it was considering all options before it in an attempt to restore the 2009 Delhi High Court verdict decriminalising homosexuality.The Supreme Court had on Wednesday set aside the Delhi High Court verdict and said that consensual sex between two adults of the same gender is an offence.Article 377 of the Indian Penal Code , which dates back to the time of British rule in India , punishes `` carnal intercourse against the order of nature '' .
As featured on Mo . Democrat makes headlines questioning 9/11 Secretary of state candidate MD Rabbi Alam of Kansas City later apologized for remarks they made , including claims that no Jewish people died in the 2001 terrorist attacks .
In a series of discussions with VIN News , a Muslim Democrat running for Secretary of State of the state of Missouri retracted their position in regard to their 9-11 conspiracy theory and has apologized for stating that no Jews were killed at the World Trade Center on 9-11 . According to a report in the Washington Free Beacon , MD Alam , a Democratic Party caucus chairperson vying to become Missouri 's next secretary of state `` has speculated about Jewish involvement in the September 11th terrorist attacks and participated in an event with a Muslim cleric who has accused Israel of terrorism and alleged that the U.S. invented the HIV disease . `` Why was 9/11 was a official holiday for all Jewish people worked in the WTC ? '' Alam asked in an Internet discussion titled , `` Was 9/11 a conspiracy ? ? '' They continued , `` My question was , 'What 's the reason not a single Jew was killed on that day , ' '' Alam said , maintaining that their inquiries are based on facts , rather than a bias against Jewish people . `` Was there a single Jew killed on that day ? '' Alam went on to tout the 9/11 Truther film Loose Change 9/11 , and challenged readers to `` tell me how many of the Jewish people died on the 9/11 tragedy ? '' Asked in an interview Monday about their provocative views , Alam stood by their controversial writings , admitting that they have been `` waiting to discuss it with somebody . '' When Rabbi Yair Hoffman reporting for VINNEWS contacted Mr. Alam , they initially did confirm that indeed , that was their position . Mr. Alam was then asked by the reporter , `` I personally know people that were killed on that tragic day , and can send you information about them . What is your position ? Are you saying that these people went into hiding or that their children , their father , and their brother are all lying and , in fact , they are still alive ? '' However , after being emailed and seeing evidence that , in fact , Jews were killed in this national tragedy , Mr. Alam offered their apologies and explained that they had been convinced by the material they had read on the internet regarding the issue . Alam was then put in touch with other people who personally knew other Jewish 9-11 victims . Alam then expressed some outrage that such misinformation could appear and promised that they would confront those sources . They requested that VINNEWS convey their sincere apologies to those who have been hurt by their initial claims . According to the Washington Beacon , Mr. Alam is `` an Obama campaign ally and Missouri-based Democratic activist who chairs the National Democratic Party Asian American Caucus ( NDPAAC ) , a Democratic National Committee-sponsored organization that liaises with Asian minorities . The State Department long ago debunked the insinuation that Jews , forewarned about the attacks , stayed home on September 11 . Officials estimate that somewhere between 200 and 400 Jews died in the World Trade Center ; five Israeli citizens also perished in the tragedy . '' Mr. Alam confirmed this position again to VINNEWS on tape as well . In later conversation , Mr. Alam still expressed some conspiracy thinking about the World Trade Center bombings .
South Africa 's `` chicken war '' with the US has been resolved , removing a barrier to the renewal of a key trade agreement . Restrictions on US poultry imports to South Africa had threatened South Africa 's inclusion in the extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) which enables African countries to import certain products to the US duty-free .
“ We had a discussion on a quota of poultry products that would enter South Africa and essentially this will consolidate and fortify South Africa 's position in the African Growth and Opportunity Act , ” South Africa 's Minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies told RFI in an interview at the South African embassy in Paris on Saturday .
The chicken war resulted from accusations that US poultry producers had been dumping cheap chicken into the South African marketplace , hurting domestic producers who could not compete on cost .
Pretoria slapped anti-dumping charges on US chicken exports to protect its own chicken farmers . However , the American poultry industry lobbied hard to have South Africa 's tariffs lifted and called into question the favourable treatment other South African export products receive through AGOA .
The agreement on a quota system for US poultry paves the way for the renewal of AGOA but is likely to threaten South Africa 's domestic chicken producers .
“ It will place the United States as a very prominent importer , ” said Minister Davies . “ It will not just be that it will replace other imports , it will have an impact on local production . ''
The compromise reached between the two countries removes any obstruction to South Africa 's inclusion in AGOA as the agreement comes up for renewal later this year .
Since its inception 15 years ago , AGOA has given a boost to the South African economy and in 2014 it banked more than 1.7 billion dollars of export revenue as a result of the agreement . Considering the impact of AGOA across sub-Saharan Africa , South Africa benefits from up to 75 per cent of non-oil US imports under the agreement .
“ I think by solving this matter we 've put the relationship back on a more cordial and productive footing , ” said Davies , following negotiations that took place in Paris .
“ It 's important to say that the South African Poultry Association , which had nothing to gain , came to the party and was a participant in this negotiation and played a patriotic role in terms of looking to the bigger national interest and making a concession , ” they added .
In light of the concession made by South African poultry producers , there will be initiatives to try to manage the fallout from the likely reduction in sales of domestic chicken products .
“ There will be a package to support small black companies in the import of the US product and its packaging and further processing in our country , ” the minister said . “ We have been talking more generally about other components of a developmental package which we have to work through , which would include training of people in our poultry industry in the United States . ”
The US Senate has already agreed to extend the AGOA agreement . The finer details will be debated by Congress with a renewal of the agreement expected by September .
Supermarket insists loyalty scheme still offers good value even with reward points cut in half from 11 April next year
Sainsbury 's has infuriated shoppers by halving the number of Nectar reward points it will offer members of its loyalty scheme .
From 11 April customers will earn only one point for every pound they spend in stores or online . The supermarket chain will also stop rewarding shoppers with a point for every bag they reuse , but they will get a point per litre of fuel bought from Sainsbury 's forecourts .
Sainsbury 's , which has seen sales slide , insisted its Nectar card – the largest loyalty programme in the UK with more than 19 million users – still offered good value . In an email to customers , it said there would be “ lots of new opportunities to boost your balance faster and more value when you spend your points ” .
Last month Sainsbury 's changed its Brand Match promotion , saying it would match its prices against Asda , rather than Tesco . Some were angered by the change .
One wrote on Sainsbury 's Facebook page : “ Ridiculous to lower the value of Nectar points – same as Brand Match is Asda only . Does Sainbury 's not make enough money ? Can someone give me a valid reason ? ”
Another tweeted : “ Thanks @ sainsburys for halving the Nectar points we get from you . It makes @ waitrose and the new M & S Sevenoaks and Lidl even more appealing . ”
Sainsbury 's said : “ We are changing the way customers earn Nectar points and launching more high-value bonus events , like Swipe to Win , 10xpoints on fuel … and adding more categories to our Christmas ‘ Double Up ' event so that customers can make their points go even further . ”
Britain 's shopping landscape is shifting , with shoppers flocking to German discount chains Aldi and Lidl , which do not have loyalty cards .
Tesco pioneered supermarket loyalty schemes with its hugely successful Clubcard , and others followed suit . Dunnhumby , the company behind Tesco 's Clubcard , whose data enabled it to oust Sainsbury 's as market leader in 1995 , is now thought to be up for sale as Tesco seeks to restore its battered finances .
Morrisons has just launched its own loyalty scheme , called Match & More . Escalating the supermarket price war , it pledged to match prices not only with the other big four supermarkets but also Aldi and Lidl – the first time such a promise has been made in the grocery sector .
Crawford Davidson , customer director at Morrisons , insisted that customers “ like the idea of points-based supermarket cards ; they like the idea of getting something back from shopping ” .
They added : “ What they find frustrating is all the silly bits of receipt paper they have to remember to get their price promise or their price match . ”
Food prices across Britain are falling at the fastest rate since 2002 , by 1.4 % , according to the latest inflation figures from the Office for National Statistics .
I recently helped a client with serious PostgreSQL problems . Their database is part of an application that configures and monitors large networks ; each individual network node reports its status to the database every five minutes . The client was having problems with one table in particular , containing about 25,000 rows — quite small , by modern database standards , and thus unlikely to cause problems .
However , things were n't so simple : This table was growing to more than 20 GB every week , even though autovacuum was running . In response , the company established a weekly ritual : Shut down the application , run a VACUUM FULL , and then restart things . This solved the problem in the short term — but by the end of the week , the database had returned to be about 20 GB in size . Clearly , something needed to be done about it .
I 'm happy to say that I was able to fix this problem , and that the fix was n't so difficult . Indeed , the source of the problem might well be obvious to someone with a great deal of PostgreSQL experience . That 's because the problem mostly stemmed from a failure to understand how PostgreSQL 's transactions work , and how they can influence the functioning of VACUUM , the size of your database , and the reliability of your system . I 've found that this topic is confusing to many people who are new to PostgreSQL , and I thus thought that it would be a useful to walk others through the problem , and then describe how we solved it .
PostgreSQL , like many other modern relational databases , uses a technology known as multiversion concurrency control ( “ MVCC ” ) . MVCC reduces the number of exclusive locks placed on a database 's rows , by keeping around multiple versions of each row . If that sounds weird , then I 'll try to explain . Let 's start with a very simple table :
CREATE TABLE Foo ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY , x INTEGER NOT NULL ) ;
Now let 's add 1 million rows to that table :
INSERT INTO Foo ( x ) VALUES ( generate_series ( 1,1000000 ) ) ;
Now , how much space does this table take up on disk ? We can use the built-in pg_relation_size function , but that 'll return a large integer representing a number of bytes . Fortunately , PostgreSQL also include pg_size_pretty , which turns a number into something understandable by computer-literate humans :
SELECT pg_size_pretty ( pg_relation_size ( 'foo ' ) ) ; 35 MB
What happens to the size of our table if we UPDATE each row , incrementing x by 1 ?
UPDATE Foo SET x = x + 1 ; SELECT pg_size_pretty ( pg_relation_size ( 'foo ' ) ) ; 69 MB
If you 're new to MVCC , then the above is probably quite surprising . After all , you might expect an UPDATE query to change each of the existing 1 million rows , keeping the database size roughly identical .
However , this is not at all the case : Rather than replace or update existing rows , UPDATE in an MVCC system adds new rows . Indeed , in an MVCC-based system , our queries never directly change or remove any rows . INSERT adds new rows , DELETE marks rows as no longer needed , and UPDATE performs both an INSERT and a DELETE .
That 's right : In an MVCC system , UPDATE does n't change existing rows , although we might have the illusion of this occurring . Every time you UPDATE a table , you 're doubling its size .
At this point , many newcomers to PostgreSQL are even more confused : How can it be that deleted rows do n't go away ? And why would UPDATE work in such a crazy way ? And how can all of this possibly help me ?
The key to understanding what 's happening is to realize that once a row has been added to the system , it can not be changed . However , its space can be reused by new rows , if the old row is no longer accessible by any transaction .
This starts to make a bit more sense if you realize that every transaction in PostgreSQL has a unique ID number , known as the “ transaction ID. ” This number constantly increases , providing us with a running count of transactions in the system . Every time we INSERT a row , PostgreSQL records the first transaction ID from which the row should now be visible , in a column known as “ xmin. ” You are an think of xmin as the row 's birthday . You can not normally see xmin , but PostgreSQL will show it to you , if you ask for it explicitly :
SELECT xmin , * FROM Foo WHERE id < 5 ORDER BY id ; │ xmin │ id │ x │ │ 187665 │ 1 │ 2 │ │ 187665 │ 2 │ 3 │ │ 187665 │ 3 │ 4 │ │ 187665 │ 4 │ 5 │
In an MVCC-based system , DELETE does n't really delete a row . Rather , it indicates that a row is no longer available to future transactions . We can see an initial hint of this if , when we SELECT the contents of a table , we ask for not only xmin , but also xmax — the final transaction ( or “ expiration date , ” if you like ) for which a row should be visible :
SELECT xmin , xmax , * FROM Foo WHERE id < 5 ORDER BY id ; │ xmin │ xmax │ id │ x │ │ 187656 │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │ │ 187656 │ 0 │ 2 │ 3 │ │ 187656 │ 0 │ 3 │ 4 │ │ 187656 │ 0 │ 4 │ 5 │
We can see that each of these rows was added in the same transaction ID ( 187656 ) . Moreover , all of these rows are visible , since their xmax value is 0 . ( Do n't worry ; we 'll see other xmax values in a little bit . ) If I update some of these rows , we 'll see that their xmin value will be different :
UPDATE Foo SET x = x + 1 WHERE id IN ( 1,3 ) ; SELECT xmin , * FROM Foo WHERE id < 5 ORDER BY id ; │ xmin │ id │ x │ │ 187668 │ 1 │ 3 │ │ 187665 │ 2 │ 3 │ │ 187668 │ 3 │ 5 │ │ 187665 │ 4 │ 5 │
The rows with ID 1 and 3 were added in transaction 187668 , whereas the rows with ID 2 and 4 were added in an earlier transaction , number 187665 .
Since I 've already told you that rows can not be changed by a query , this raises an interesting question : What happened to the rows with IDs 1 and 3 that were added in the first transaction , number 187665 ?
The answer is : Those rows still exist in the system ! They have not been modified or removed . But the system did mark them as having an xmax of 187668 , the transaction ID in which the new , replacement rows are now available .
Transaction IDs only go up . But you can imagine a hypothetical time-traveler 's database , in which you could move the transaction ID down , and see rows from an earlier era . ( Somehow , I doubt that this would be a very popular television series . )
The thing is , we do n't need a hypothetical , time-traveler 's database in order to see such behavior . All we need is to open two separate sessions to our PostgreSQL database at the same time , and have each session open a transaction .
You see , when you BEGIN a new transaction , your actions are hidden from the rest of the world — and similarly , modifications made elsewhere in the database are hidden from you . You can thus have a situation in two different sessions see completely different versions of the same row , thanks to their different transaction IDs . This might sound crazy , but it actually helps the database to run smoothly , with a minimum of conflicts and locks .
So , let 's open two different PostgreSQL sessions , and take a look at what happens . In order to distinguish between them , I used the \set command in psql to make PROMPT1 either “ Session A > ” or “ Session B > ” . Here 's session A :
Session A > BEGIN ; Session A > select xmin , xmax , * from foo where id < 5 order by id ; │ xmin │ xmax │ id │ x │ │ 187668 │ 0 │ 1 │ 3 │ │ 187665 │ 0 │ 2 │ 3 │ │ 187668 │ 0 │ 3 │ 5 │ │ 187665 │ 0 │ 4 │ 5 │
And here is session B :
Session B > BEGIN ; Session B > select xmin , xmax , * from foo where id < 5 order by id ; │ xmin │ xmax │ id │ x │ │ 187668 │ 0 │ 1 │ 3 │ │ 187665 │ 0 │ 2 │ 3 │ │ 187668 │ 0 │ 3 │ 5 │ │ 187665 │ 0 │ 4 │ 5 │
At this point , they are identical ; both sessions see precisely the same rows , with the same xmin and xmax . Now let 's modify the values of two rows in session A :
Session A > update foo set x = x + 1 where id in ( 1,3 ) ;
What do we see now in session A ?
Session A > select xmin , xmax , * from foo where id < 5 order by id ; │ xmin │ xmax │ id │ x │ │ 187670 │ 0 │ 1 │ 4 │ │ 187665 │ 0 │ 2 │ 3 │ │ 187670 │ 0 │ 3 │ 6 │ │ 187665 │ 0 │ 4 │ 5 │
Just as we would expect , we have two new rows ( IDs 1 and 3 ) , and two old rows ( IDs 2 and 4 ) , which we can distinguish via the xmin value . In all cases , the rows have an xmax value of 0 .
Let 's return to session B , and see what things look like there . ( Note that I have n't committed any transactions here ! )
Session B > select xmin , xmax , * from foo where id < 5 order by id ; │ xmin │ xmax │ id │ x │ │ 187668 │ 187670 │ 1 │ 3 │ │ 187665 │ 0 │ 2 │ 3 │ │ 187668 │ 187670 │ 3 │ 5 │ │ 187665 │ 0 │ 4 │ 5 │
That 's right — the rows that session B sees are no longer the rows that session A sees . Session B continues to see the same rows as were visible when it started the transaction . We can see that the xmax of session B 's old rows is the same as the xmin of session A 's new rows . That 's because any transaction after 187670 will see the new row ( i.e. , with an xmin of 187670 ) , but any transaction started before 187670 will see the old row ( i.e. , with an xmax of 187670 ) .
I hope that the picture is now coming together : When you INSERT a new row , its xmin is the current transaction ID , and its xmax is 0 . When you DELETE a row , its xmax is changed to be the current transaction ID . And when you UPDATE a row , PostgreSQL does both of these actions . That 's why the UPDATE I did earlier , on all of the rows in the table , doubled its size . ( More on that in a moment . )
This allows different transactions to work independently , without having to wait for locks . Imagine if session B wants to look at row with ID 3 ; because of MVCC , it does n't need to wait to read it . Heck , session B can even change the row with ID 3 , although it 'll hang until session A commits or rolls back .
And indeed , another benefit of MVCC is that rollbacks are trivially easy to implement : If we COMMIT session A and roll back session B , then session A 's view of the world will be the current one , for all following transactions . But if we ROLL BACK session A , then everything is fine ; PostgreSQL keeps track of the fact that session A was rolled back , and that we should actually be using ( until further notice ) the rows with an xmax of 187670 .
As you can imagine , this can lead to some trouble . If every UPDATE increases the number of rows , and every DELETE fails to free up any space , every PostgreSQL database will eventually run out of room , no ? Well , yes — except for VACUUM , which is the garbage-collecting mechanism for PostgreSQL 's rows . VACUUM can be run manually , but it 's normally run via “ autovacuum , ” a program that runs in the background , and invokes VACUUM on a regular basis .
VACUUM does n't free space from your PostgreSQL database . Rather , it identifies rows whose xmin is greater than the current transaction ID , and thus marks those rows as available for re-use . PostgreSQL thus keeps track of not only the current transaction ID , but also the ID of the earliest still-open transaction . So long as that transaction is open , it needs to be able to see the rows from that point in time .
Do n't confuse VACUUM with VACUUM FULL ; the later does indeed clear out space from a PostgreSQL database , but locks the database while it 's doing so . If you have a serious 24/7 application , then VACUUM FULL is a very bad idea . The regular autovacuum daemon , albeit perhaps with a bit of configuration , should take care of identifying which rows can and should be marked for deletion .
In the case of my client 's problem , my initial thought was that autovacuum was n't running . However , a quick look at the pg_stat_user_tables view showed that autovacuum was running on a regular basis .
However , VACUUM will mark a row as eligible for reuse if no other transactions can see it . ( After all , if a session remains open , then it still needs to see those old row versions . ) Meaning that if a transaction remains open from the time the system starts up , VACUUM will never identify any rows as eligible for reuse , because there is still an open transaction whose ID is lower than the xmax of the deleted rows .
And this is precisely what happened to my client : It turns out that their application , at startup , was opening several transactions with BEGIN statements… and then never committing those transactions or rolling them back . None of those transactions led to a lock in PostgreSQL , because they were n't executing any query that would lead to a conflict . And autovacuum was both running and reporting that it ran on each table — because it had indeed done so .
But when it came time to mark the old rows as eligible for reuse , VACUUM ignored all of the rows in the entire database , including our 23,000-row table — because of the transaction that the application had opened at startup . It did n't matter how many times we can VACUUM , whether it was done manually or automatically , or what else was running at the time : All of the old versions of every row in our table were kept around by PostgreSQL , leading to a massive disk usage and database slowness . Stopping the application had the effect of closing those transactions , and thus allowing VACUUM FULL to do its magic , albeit at the cost of system downtime . And because the application opened the transactions at startup , any fix was bound to be a temporary one .
My client was a bit surprised to discover that the entire database could encounter such problems from an open transaction that was neither committed nor rolled back . However , I hope that you now see why the space was n't reclaimed , and why the database acted as it did .
The solution , of course , was to get rid of those three open , empty transactions at startup ; once we did that , everything ran smoothly .
Transactions are a brilliant and useful invention , but in PostgreSQL ( and other MVCC systems ) , you should n't be holding onto open transactions for too long . Doing so might have surprisingly unpleasant consequences . Commit or rollback as soon as you can — or you might find yourself with a database accumulating gigabytes full of old , unnecessary rows .

Valero Energy Corp. 's investments in renewable fuel moved forward Thursday with the completion of a plant that soon will produce renewable diesel fuel from fat .
In a venture known as Diamond Green Diesel LLC , the San Antonio refiner joined 50-50 partner Darling International Inc. of Irving to build the $ 413 million plant at Valero 's St. Charles refinery near New Orleans .
At full production , the plant will produce 9,300 barrels a day of renewable diesel from animal fat , cooking oil and corn oil into renewable diesel , Darling said in a statement .
The diesel will help refiners meet federal requirements that certain volumes of renewables be blended into transportation fuels .
Valero will market the diesel produced at the plant , which company spokesperson Bill Day said will be “ a premium product , because unlike other types of biodiesel , it is nearly identical to petroleum-based diesel and can ship by pipeline . ”
Diesel demand : Gulf Coast diesel exports to rise as production hits 23-year high
About $ 50 million was shaved from the plant 's cost because it was built on land at Valero 's refinery and will use existing utilities and infrastructure , Day said . In addition , the site is near a rail line and docks .
Diamond Green Diesel is leasing the site from Valero . Terms of the lease were not disclosed .
In a presentation to investors , Darling said the plant will always have available feedstock . But the venture has the flexibility to purchase feedstock from other suppliers if it 's more economical .
The plant will use a three-stage process to turn fats into fuel using hydrogen and catalysts .
Alternative diesel : Tesoro to buy ‘ green ' crude oil
In June 2011 , Valero turned down a loan guarantee from the Energy Department for the Diamond Green Diesel plant and chose to finance the project internally . The federal loan program “ was costly and unwieldy , ” Day said .
Diamond Green Diesel is one of a number of investments Valero has made in renewable energy ventures . The company owns 10 ethanol plants in the Midwest and a 50-megawatt wind farm at its McKee refinery north of Amarillo .
Darling recycles beef , poultry and pork by-products into useable ingredients such as feed-grade fats . It also recovers and converts used cooking oil and commercial bakery waste into feed and fuel ingredients . Also , the company collects grease from restaurants .
SOFIA ( Reuters ) - Bulgaria said on Wednesday it only had an “ indication ” that Lebanon 's Hezbollah might have been behind a deadly bus bombing in July and that this alone did not justify any European Union move to list it as a terrorist group .
The new Socialist-led government backed away from charges by its centre-right predecessor that the Shi'ite Muslim militant group had carried out the attack that killed five Israelis and their Bulgarian bus driver in the Black Sea city of Burgas .
“ It is important that the ( EU ) decision be based not only on the bombing in Burgas because I think the evidence we have is not explicit , ” Foreign Minister Kristian Vigenin , whose government took office last week , told national state radio BNR .
“ There is an indication that it is possible ( that Hezbollah was behind it ) but we can not take decisions with important consequences for the EU based on indirect data .
“ If we have enough serious proof from other cases , then we will not waver to back such a decision , ” Vigenin said .
Hezbollah has denied any involvement in the Burgas bombing .
Vigenin said the Bulgarian authorities were pursuing their inquiry into the attack and would keep EU governments informed .
A British request to blacklist Hezbollah ran into opposition in the EU on Tuesday , with several governments voicing concern that doing this would increase instability in the Middle East .
Some diplomats have said that such a move would complicate the EU 's contacts with Lebanon , where Hezbollah is part of the coalition government , and could increase turmoil in a country already suffering a spillover of civil war from Syria
Britain , which has in the past held contacts with what it calls Hezbollah 's “ political wing ” has argued that the group should face European sanctions because of its involvement in the Burgas bombing and a plot to attack Israeli interests in Cyprus .
Blacklisting Hezbollah would mark a major policy shift for the EU , which has resisted pressure from Israel and Washington to do so for years .
In February , the previous Bulgarian cabinet , a staunch ally of Washington , urged European governments to take a harder stance towards Hezbollah after blaming it for the Burgas attack .
The Socialists , then in opposition , accused the centre-right government of rushing to implicate Hezbollah without proof and exposing the Balkan country to possible new terrorist attacks .
EU governments will again discuss the proposal to blacklist Hezbollah later this month .
A New York City landlord is demanding more than $ 27,000 from the estate of a Sept. 11 terrorist attack victim .
Danielle Kousoulis , 29 , worked on the 104th floor of the World Trade Center 's north tower as a vice president for Cantor Fitzgerald . They signed a lease on a $ 2,500-a-month loft apartment 10 days before a hijacked plane crashed into their workplace .
In a letter this month , landlord Denise M. Lyman claimed they were an unpaid creditor and threatened to take Kousoulis ' family in Haddon Township , N.J. , to court .
The New York Daily News reported that one of the complaints against the dead woman was that they failed to give three-months notice that they were leaving .
`` We 're going through enough without having to go through this as well , '' Danielle 's mother , Zoe , told the Courier-Post newspaper of Cherry Hill , N.J. `` I ca n't see how greedy people can be . ''
Zoe Kousoulis , the administrator of their daughter 's estate , said there have been other problems with Lyman .
They said Lyman refused to let the family into their daughter 's apartment to get a hairbrush for a DNA sample to identify any remains . The family finally obtained the sample with the assistance of the police .
Lyman did not return messages from The Associated Press seeking comment .
In letter to Lyman from Zoe Kousoulis last October , they told the landlord that their daughter 's apartment would be vacated by Oct. 22 . Family members said they cleaned the apartment , left the key with the doorman and arranged for the Salvation Army to take away remaining furniture .
When Lyman received the letter , they called Danielle 's brother-in-law , Sean Hagerty , and demanded that nothing be removed from the apartment , the Kousoulises said . The landlord also told the doorman not to allow the Salvation Army into the apartment .
Neighbors and a doorman said Lyman and their teenage daughter moved into the apartment in the Packard Condominium building .
Under New York state common law , a lease does not automatically end when a tenant dies — both parties must agree to surrender it . But New York City attorneys and property managers said a landlord moving into an apartment is evidence of a surrender .
`` If the landlord decided to move into it , then they would have extinguished the responsibility of the tenant , '' said Charles Mehlman , senior vice president of the Lefrak Organization , which owns and leases 60,000 apartments in the city .
Attorney Jack Lester , who specializes in real estate law but is not involved in the Kousoulis case , also said the family was under no obligation to pay rent beyond the point the landlord moved in .
`` I think it 's outrageous from a legal standpoint , and it 's even worse from a moral and humane standpoint , '' Lester said . `` It 's shocking that they would have no regard for the survivors of the people that perished in the worst attack on American soil . ''
A New York City attorney is handling the Kousoulises ' case pro bono . The American Red Cross also offered financial assistance .
In their recent opinion piece in the Missoula Independent , Rick Bass intentionally makes a series of errors , widespread smears , and outright untruths about the Pacific Northwest Trail ( PNT ) as it winds ( yes , winds Rick , more on that later ) . Bass 's oppositional rhetoric to the PNT even disinters the ghost of famed grizzly bear researcher Chuck Jonkel to give a shine of credibility to their self-indulgent diatribe .
First thing 's first , I am a lifelong wilderness advocate and grizzly bear proponent , with longer than Bass 's time in Montana since they moved from their native Texas . I relish the presence of the great bruin in large wild places , but I also believe that wilderness has to be experienced to be appreciated and valued by society . Bass seems to think that they belong to the small , entitled Yaak Yacht Club that is blessed with self-granted access to the wild of upper Yaak , and they apparently loathe others enjoying and recreating their adopted backyard . The entire article smacks of wilderness elitism that seems to come from the recent arrivals to Montana as they seek to close the gate behind them on the way in .
The Pacific Northwest Trail was designated by Congress in 2009 as one of America 's 11 National Scenic Trails . It is a validation of conservation movement as it creation definitely aids in protecting the very grizzly habitat that Bass and I deeply care about .
Bass 's first salvo of propaganda comes from theirs characterizing the PNT as “ a recreational hellhole , a rogue , unapproved 1,200-mile spur trail to the much-trampled Pacific Crest Trail. ” Let 's address the “ spur trail ” allegation . The PNT almost entirely follows existing trails and roads that already provide mobility in the Yaak ( see the maps at https : //www.fs.usda.gov/main/pnt/maps-publications ) . It is not being bulldozed in , it is simply a route utilizing existing US Forest Service infrastructure . Bass falsely states that The Pacific Northwest Trail Association ( PNTA ) “ drew a ruler through the upper Yaak ” to create the PNT route . If one were to spend more than a moment looking the actual maps of the route , you would see that the trail winds through Yaak using existing trails and roads . “ The proposed trail goes through the heart of roadless country ” ? By following existing roads and trails ( and yes the occasional off-trail excursion ) does not invalidate the concept of roadless areas . Bass is quite deceptive in creating the illusion of new infrastructure that “ tears ass through the middle of the Yaak 's prime griz habitat ” . Bass double-downs on their straight-line trail falsehood again by writing , “ the idea of a thru-hiking trail , an endurance-jock human highway , a “ zone of disturbance ” 1,000 feet wide , running in a straight line from Glacier National Park to the Pacific Coast . ”
This brings us to Bass 's naked intolerance for others using their wilderness . They have somehow absolved themselves of any impact in Yaak Valley , yet they collect firewood , drives the roads , hunts wild game that could feed many a bear , and lives in a home . Their own ecological impact on the Yaak is much higher that of some hiker that spends a couple of days in the area . In this piece , they repeatedly characterize to hikers as jocks , bloggers ( yeah Rick , hikers ca n't write ) , and polluters on an industrial scale . The truth is hikers are by-and-large extremely conservation-minded and vocal , effective advocates for wild places around the globe .
Now enter into the world of math magic by Bass where they simply pull numbers out of thin air and molds them to bolster their own argument . Let 's consider their dubious reasoning ;
“ Let 's say a modest average of 4,000 thru-hikers per season pass through , spending a week or more , crossing the upper Yaak . That 's more than 30,000 user-nights , a potential 60,000 campfires . ”
First , the “ modest ” 4,000 hiker number is completely plucked from a fevered imagination . The other popular thru-trail in the western United States is the Pacific Crest Trail . It follows the Pacific coastal mountains from California , through Oregon , and terminating in Washington , and it received 5,657 permitted thru-hikers last year . Of that number , only 707 actually completed the entire route . It is improbable that the isolated PNT would ever see numbers even remotely close to those levels .
Second , the PNT route has a total mileage of roughly 45 miles from Gypsy Meadows in the east to the Idaho border . Thru-hikers have to make time as they have a vast distance to travel before the season changes in order to complete the complete thru-hike . You actually think that they will average one week to travel 45 miles on existing trails and roads through the Yaak when they need to cover 1,200 miles in the short season ?
And finally , their absolute bullshit 60,000 campsites based on the erroneous 30,000 user-nights . First , have you ever lit two campfires every night on any of your hiking trips ? The answer for this kid is a resounding HELL NO ! And almost every hiker that would ever dream to undertake an endeavor like the challenging PNT would not have any inclination to create a campfire every goddamn night . Rick , ever heard of a backpacking stove or packaged meals ?
However , Bass is not without a heart for the plight of the hiker and our government agencies . They seem to be deeply concerned with the workload of the US Border Patrol . “ I ca n't imagine the U.S. Border Patrol is too happy about the route ” , they speculate . Are you kidding me ? They want to exclude people from the Yaak because of its proximity to the United States/Canada border because border security…that is absolutely laughable and completely unfounded .
Bass 's final indignity is creating the oh-so-convenient myth of the lost , garbage-lobbing hikers . “ But this current wandering dusty stream of lost penitents , leaving messy camps , is neither legal , acceptable nor necessary . They inflate the number of lost hikers to encompass all thru-hikers in their mind while completely ignoring that almost all hikers religiously apply Leave No Trace ethics to their campsites , which are almost always existing spots . Legal ? It is illegal to hike , Mr. Bass ? Where in the recesses of your mind did you come up with the idea that it is against the law to hike through your precious backyard ? They even seem to think that the publishing of the route maps is somehow “ encouraging and abetting illegal use ” . This language that would make any jailhouse lawyer proud .
So , does Bass have any enlightened , Solomon-like wisdom to resolve the vaguely perceivable conflict between the PNT and grizzly bear habitat in the Yaak ? Their solution to simply recommend that the PNT go through someone else 's backyard . They construct one straw-man argument after another to preserve their own personal aesthetic of the Yaak Valley , a vast wilderness available only to the select , privileged few ( and imagine that they are among them ) .
And one more thing , if Rick Bass is so concerned about over-use the Yaak , why has they made a career of popularizing the area to their massive readership ? Words contained in the Book of the Yaak and Winter have surely intrigued many of the hikers seeking to travel the Pacific Northwest Trail , and yet , they fail to recognize their own influence .
Rainbowfish embryos , as young as only four days after fertilisation , are able to smell potential predatory threats , a new study by Australian researchers has found .
Published today , the findings show these embryos use olfactory cues to determine and differentiate between predatory threats - while still in the developing egg .
Researchers bred rainbowfish ( Melanotaenia duboulayi ) in a clinic aquarium and harvested the eggs . After letting the eggs develop for four days , they placed them in a water-filled petri dish and added different smelling compounds to it .
According to Culum Brown , associate professor at Macquarie University and one of the authors of the study , the “ predator smells ” were simply water taken from a fish tank containing a goldfish and a spangled perch , which are an introduced and native predator respectively .
Under a microscope , they observed for changes in the heart rate by counting the time taken for 100 heart beats . Because an increase in heart rate is a primary stress response that provides increased oxygen to the body , researchers can gauge how stressful the embryos find various experiences based on such changes .
Macquarie University
The results showed that when embryos detected danger their heart rate increased , just as it would if you were frightened . This meant that their chemosensory system , which is required to detect and respond to chemical cues , is already developed well enough to allow them to differentiate between various smells just four days after fertilisation .
“ As behavioural ecologists , we tend to think of anything an animal does as being a trade-off between predation and behaviours involved in foraging , courtship and territorial defence , ” said Grant Brown , professor and associate dean at Concordia University . “ These results show that the basis for these trade-offs may occur much earlier than previously thought . ”
Jennifer Kelley , a scientist with the University of Western Australia , explains that predator recognition is required at such an early age because responding to predator cues is absolutely crucial for early survival . For example , detection of “ alarm cues ” suggests that other fish in the vicinity have been attacked by predators .
“ Although fishes can fine-tune their skills at later life stages through experience with predators and their cues such as odours , the findings show that the response of the embryos was innate because the fish were kept without predators for many generations , ” they said .
Eileen Kortright ( Roan Art )
Associate Professor Brown agreed , saying it was likely the response referred to a genetic template . The “ predator smell ” permeates the egg membrane and the embryos detect it using their nose . If the smell matches the template for danger , they initiate a fight-or-flight response which includes increasing the heart rate .
According to Dr Kelley , the fact that the embryos showed a graded response to predators , even before hatching , suggests that they may be able to modify their development and behaviour in an adaptive way . Such flexibility allows animals to display skills that are specific to their environment .
“ It is important to understand this adaptability , particularly for native fishes such as rainbowfish . Freshwater ecosystems are facing increasing threats , for example from the introduction of exotic predatory species .
`` This work contributes towards understanding how Australia 's native aquatic fauna will respond to such threats , ” they said .
Dear Oliver ,
April is your month my love ! It is Autism Awareness Month and I wanted to write to you about my thoughts on ABA therapy and how we are doing things differently around here . You are a free bird . You explore your world and I am there to be sure that you are safe . That is my job . I believe that people who have been diagnosed as having autism are highly intelligent introverts . I have been thinking a lot about an alternative , any alternative , to intensive therapy that makes you so uncomfortable that you begin to stim . When you stim you typically rock on the recliner or jump on your trampoline . Occasionally you will pace or spin anything in sight . Stimming is your way of self soothing . If you are in pain , overwhelmed , anxious , or uncomfortable stimming helps you to cope . Therapists want me to direct you to something that society thinks is more socially acceptable when you start to stim . This makes no sense to me . I am supposed to force you to do something that society says is “ normal ” and you become so uncomfortable that you try to self soothe by stimming and I am supposed to stop you from doing that too ! People wonder why meltdowns erupt like Mount Etna . Some questions popped into my head that I think need answers . Is ABA therapy really effective or are we forcing children with ASD to live in constant discomfort ? Are children with ASD highly intelligent introverts and should we instead focus on their strengths instead of pushing them to change what we perceive to be weaknesses ? Would catering to their strengths in turn build confidence and self esteem resulting in less repetitive behaviors due to a lessened need for self soothing ?
I have gone in the complete opposite direction with you . I do n't let autism be your crutch . In fact your autism gives you an advantage since I am convinced you use parts of your brain that we “ normal ” people only can dream of using . By nature I am an introvert so I understand your need to be alone in your thoughts . I have directed your therapy towards things that you enjoy . I do not force you to do anything that makes you anxious or overwhelmed . I have allowed you to have Oliver time . If you are n't interested in hanging out I get that . I have allowed you to grow and develop in your time on your terms . If you need to stim I do n't interrupt that and sometimes it may last hours of you rocking or spinning but you are happy and personally I think all of your quirks are fascinating . All day I watch you . I observe you and everyday you amaze me . So I have chosen not to go the ABA route but instead focus on your strengths . The result ? An easy child who smiles almost all day . A child who has become more and more social , making eye contact , kissing me , hugging me , rolling a ball back and forth with me , and a child who is trying out different sounds . A child who sleeps and enjoys every day . I hear horror stories of children who never sleep and have all day meltdowns . I believe it is because we are expected to change you and mold you into someone you are not . My method is working .
Oliver I feel compelled to change the methods of ABA therapy . I know that children with ASD , SPD , ODD , GAD , among other diagnoses would thrive if we would just allow them to be who they are and support them and love them . You have come out of your shell . You have stopped spinning plates and lids . You are slowing eliminating meltdowns and you are becoming someone I admire . Someone with strength and endurance , a person with interests and a child who shows me love everyday . Medication scares me and I know that some children require medication but the side effects are horrifying . I am hoping that as you get older you continue to make your way comfortably without the need for medication . I am so thankful that you have such a sweet demeanor and such a loving soul .
So together we will show the world that ASD is not a disability at all . It is simply part of who you are . Who 1 in 88 are . Its intriguing and if we nuture it I believe that our world will be a much better place . A much more pleasant place . I believe that your intelligence is going to help you soar Oliver . I love your ASD . I love your SPD… . I love your soul ! ! ! ! !
Love ,
Mommy

New York state is in the process of replacing its lever voting machines with new voting equipment , but the state revealed recently that it has found problems with 50 percent of the roughly 1,500 ImageCast optical-scan machines ( shown in the video above ) that Sequoia Voting Systems has delivered to the state so far – machines that are slated to be used by dozens of counties in the state 's September 9 primary and November 4 presidential election .
Douglas Kellner , co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections , expressed frustration with the vendor , saying it appeared that Sequoia was using the state 's acceptance testing process to find problems with its machines in lieu of a sound quality-control process .
`` There 's no way the vendor could be adequately reviewing the machines and having so many problems , '' they told Threat Level . `` What it tells us is that the vendor just throws this stuff over the transom and does not do any alpha- or beta-testing of their own before they apply for certification testing . Then they expect that we 'll identify technical glitches and then they 'll correct those glitches . But correction of those glitches is an extraordinarily time-consuming process . And its very disappointing that this equipment is not ready for prime time . ''
One main problem with the machines has been the printers . The ImageCast machines are special optical-scan machines that include an LCD screen , a printer and a ballot-marking device that allows disabled voters to use them . Disabled voters view the ballot on screen or hear it read to them through headphones , then make their selection using special attachments ( a device with buttons or a sipping straw ) , after which the machine prints out a paper ballot that gets read by the optical scanner component .
The printer , Kellner noted , is a core component of the machine . But they malfunction `` if you do n't feed the paper exactly right or if the buttons are n't pushed just right , '' they said . They also have trouble handling write-in candidates . If a voter 's writing exceeds a certain width , Kellner said the printer shuts down without indicating why it 's shutting down .
`` These are serious glitches that should have been picked up in the vendor 's own quality-control process , '' they said .
But Sequoia is n't the only problem , according to counties who have reported receiving problematic machines from the state Board of Elections after the board was supposed to have tested and certified the machines . The Board of Elections is examining all of the new machines before sending them out to counties .
In Nassau County alone , the largest voting district outside of New York City , officials found problems with 85 percent of the 240 ImageCast machines it received so far – problems that the county characterized in a letter as `` substantial operational flaws that render them unusable or that require major repairs . ''
The problems include printers jamming , broken monitors and wheels , machines that would n't boot up , and misaligned printer covers that prevented the covers from closing completely , creating security concerns .
The county rejected 48 machines right at delivery , due to physical damage . Another 58 machines exhibited problems during testing , according to William Biamonte , the Democratic elections commissioner for Nassau County . [ New York counties have two election directors – one each from the Democratic and Republican parties – to avoid charges of unfair elections . ] Some of the latter machines , they said , shook dramatically when they were running and workers either had to shut them down or the machines shut themselves down from the vibration . Other machines had dead batteries or batteries that would n't hold a two-hour charge , as they were required to do .
Another 112 machines produced a `` printer failure '' error message . Biamonte says this was the result of a change Sequoia made to its firmware . They said that when they received their first batch of machines about a month ago , the machines had `` horrific paper jams . '' To fix the problem , Sequoia loaded new firmware on the systems to speed up the printer , but in doing so disabled the USB port on machines , resulting in the `` printer failure '' error messages .
Biamonte , who blames the Board of Elections in part for not noticing the problems before forwarding the machines to counties , said a state worker told them they should instruct election workers to just ignore the error message .
`` How is that acceptable ? '' Biamonte asked . `` Say you buy a brand-new car and it works good but the oil gauge is n't working . They tell you , Just drive it anyway . These are brand-new machines . $ 12,000 each . We can not in confidence send ( them ) out to a polling place knowing they have this printer error . How do we know if we really do have a printer failure ? ''
Nassau County , which has nearly 900,000 registered voters , is slated to receive 450 machines total , but has refused delivery on the remaining machines and has asked a federal court to order Sequoia to repair the machines . It also requested a review of the state Board of Elections ' acceptance and testing procedures . That review was completed Thursday by a quality-control firm hired by the Board of Elections . The firm 's report found that the Board of Elections ' procedures for accepting and testing the machines were adequate , but acknowledged that some problems may have occurred due to a lack of communication between state election officials and county officials . [ Read more info about this report after the jump . ]
Biamonte , who respects Kellner and thinks they feel as frustrated by Sequoia as they do , nonetheless called the report `` ridiculous '' and `` disingenuous , '' saying that cracked screens and jammed printers were n't the result of communication problems .
The ImageCast machines are not actually made by Sequoia but by a Canadian subcontractor named Dominion , which is based in Toronto , and a sub-subcontractor named Jaco Electronics , based in New York . A press release on Sequoia 's site noted that Jaco won the contract to produce 4,500 optical-scan machines for Sequoia/Dominion only in April of this year and needed to add 40 to 50 people to its workforce to fulfill the contract . Nassau County began receiving its machines from the state in June , which suggests that the machines may have been rushed through production too quickly .
A Sequoia spokesperson would say only that the company is working with state officials `` to identify and resolve any voting equipment concerns they may have . ''
The Sequoia ImageCast machines were designed exclusively for New York and are not currently being used in any other state . The machines have not yet been federally certified , though Kellner says Sequoia assured the state last January that federal testing and certification would be completed on the system by April or May , before the state began its own testing and certification of the equipment .
New York does n't have a choice about using the machines this year . The state was sued by the Department of Justice for failing to meet a federal deadline for having accessible voting machines in place . The Help America Vote Act passed in 2002 requires every voting precinct to provide at least one accessible voting machine for disabled voters by 2006 . New York is just now getting the machines in place .
Because the ImageCast machines are still undergoing certification testing by the state , only the ballot marking device – and not the scanning portion of the machine – will be used in New York this year . The counties will continue to use lever machines for non-disabled voters until 2009 . The printed paper ballots produced by the ballot-marking portion of the machine will be read by hand , rather than scanned .
One interesting tidbit turned up in the quality-control report that examined the state board of elections acceptance and testing process . The report reveals that a voting machine vendor is the first to examine the machines when they arrive to the state 's voting machine warehouse from the manufacturer . The vendor representative is supposed to examine the machines for missing or damaged parts .
Once the vendor representative has signed off on the equipment , it goes to temporary workers that the state has hired to test the machines . Biamonte says the temp workers are college students , who work under the supervision of board of election employees .
After the testing is completed , a tamper-evident seal is placed on the machines and they 're passed back to the vendor representative who is responsible for shipping off the machines to counties .
This creates chain-of-custody concerns that Biamonte says are exacerbated by the fact that when they received their machines in Nassau County , a number of the tamper-evident seals on them were cracked .
`` How do we know this was n't tampered with ? '' they said .

Which country has the most venomous animals ? Surprisingly , it 's not Australia but Mexico with 80 , followed by Brazil with 79 and then Australia with just 66 ( they just happen to be more potent ) . So how is venomous defined here ?
Reddit user lanson15 used the Living Hazards Database from the Armed Forces Pest Management Board , which “ … is a comprehensive compilation of more than 500 species worldwide , which are reported to cause serious injury or death of humans . ”
In addition to the top 3 countries above , Colombia , India , Indonesia and Vietnam all have over 50 different species apiece . Europe , Central Asia and Canada are at the other extreme , with fewer than 10 species per country . And if you 're wondering about France , it 's because it includes French Guiana , which is considered an overseas department of France .
Generally speaking warmer places have more venomous species than colder places , although there are some interesting exceptions to this rule such as the Caribbean , Western Sahara , Madagascar , Bhutan and Lesotho , to name a few .
So if you make your travel plans based around how likely you are to get bitten by a snake or spider , you now have a map of which countries to visit and which to avoid .
Wonder how this looks in the United States :
Map by reddit user lanson15
Similar to the global trend , warmer Southern States have more venomous species than North States . Arizona is the clear winner ( or loser ) with over 30 species .

The National Health Journalism Fellowships program offers journalists an opportunity to explore the intersection between community health , health policy , and the nation 's growing diversity . This program will be especially valuable for journalists interested in topics related to “ health and place , ” or how neighborhood , work and home environments impact health and life expectancy . As part of that exploration , our Fellows will see firsthand how race , ethnicity and class influence health with trips out in the field from our institute 's home base in Los Angeles , an international city that has been called a `` proving ground '' for a multicultural society . California has the largest numbers of Asian and Latino residents in the nation , and many of the health challenges and opportunities that accompany changing demographics have been debated and legislated here .
During field trips and seminars , fellows hear from respected investigative journalists and leaders in community health , health policy , and medicine . They go home with a deeper understanding of current public health and health policy initiatives and gain insight into the larger picture of colliding interests and political battles over health policy . Participants also explore ways to document — through data and innovative storytelling techniques — the health inequities in their local communities . Hands-on workshops provide fellows with new sources , practical reporting tips and multimedia strategies to reach a broader digital audience .
In conjunction with the National Fellowship , we also administer the Dennis A . Hunt Fund for Health Journalism , a competitive grant program to underwrite substantive reporting on community health issues . Each Hunt grantee participates in the National Fellowship and receives a $ 2,500 to $ 10,000 grant , instead of the National Fellowship stipend , to support research on a community health topic . The deadline for applications for the 2014 grants was April 18 , 2014 . Click here for details about how to apply to the 2015 National Fellowship and for a Hunt grant .

Fox News contributor Dr. Keith Ablow has come under intense criticism in recent weeks for their public opposition to Chaz Bono 's participation on ABC 's Dancing with the Stars . In a column posted on FoxNews.com earlier this month , Ablow warned parents that letting their children watch Bono on television could `` kindle '' their desire to become transgender and `` amputate '' their body parts :
It is a toxic and unnecessary byproduct of the tragic celebration of transgender surgery that millions of young people who do watch `` Dancing with the Stars '' will have to ponder this question : Maybe my problems really stem from the fact that I 'm a girl inside a boy 's body ( or a boy inside a girls body ) . Maybe I 'm not a tomboy ; I 'm just a boy ! Maybe I 'm not just being bullied because I 'm a sensitive , reflective young man interested in flowers , not football . Maybe I 'm not just uncertain about my sexuality . Maybe I 'm a girl ! Maybe all this angst and suffering I 'm feeling as I emerge into puberty and pass through it is n't just because I 'm changing , but because I should change completely -- and have my breasts removed or my penis amputated ! It would be wrong to think that gender dysphoria can not be kindled by celebrating those who have undergone sexual reassignment surgery . Human beings do model one another -- in terms of emotion , thought and behavior . By broadcasting , applauding and mainstreaming the journey of a very disordered person who endured , and likely will continue to endure , real suffering based on extraordinarily deep psychological problems , we suggest that that journey is a smart -- even heroic -- one to take . [ emphasis added ]
Ablow has spent the last several weeks making the rounds on Fox News to defend their column . According to Ablow , allowing Bono to participate on Dancing with the Stars is akin to celebrating anorexia or heroin addiction . According to him , celebrating someone like Chaz Bono on television is `` reality bending '' because , as Ablow so eloquently put it , `` Chaz Bono is not a man ! ''
Ablow 's fierce opposition to `` broadcasting , applauding , and mainstreaming '' transgender people on television might come as a surprise to you if you 're one of the few people on earth who watched the short-lived Dr. Keith Ablow Show . Beginning in 2006 , the show ran for only one season and was cancelled due to poor ratings .
Before being yanked off the air , however , The Dr. Keith Ablow Show dedicated an entire episode to transgender people `` living with a sex change operation . '' The Dr. Ablow of 2007 seems to have had a very different take on the danger of 'celebrating ' transgender people .
In one segment , Ablow noted that a guest 's `` denial '' of their gender identity `` did n't work '' and made sure to address them with correctly gendered pronouns . Ablow even stated that it `` makes sense in every way '' for their guest to undergo gender reassignment surgery .
RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat
The BJP 's debacle in the Delhi Assembly polls and the organisational strategy for the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh or UP and Bihar are the key issues that are likely to be discussed at the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh or RSS 's four-day meet 'Manthan ' which started in Kanpur today .
`` It 's a pre-decided meeting in which all the active members of the RSS in eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh , right from Gorakhpur to Kanpur , will be participating , '' a RSS functionary told PTI .
They said the meeting would also include workers active in other organisations , including the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad or VHP .
`` The meeting will chalk out the organisation 's future strategy . Bhagwat will interact with top leaders of affiliate groups such as the VHP , the Bajrang Dal , the Durga Vahini and Majdoor Sangh , '' said Bihari Mishra , VHP 's Awadh region secretary .
`` Ways to strengthen BJP with a focus on 2017 Assembly elections will be discussed , '' Mr Mishra added .
`` The focus will be on working of the main organization and the shortcomings will be analysed , '' the functionary said .
`` During the visit , Bhagwat will take feedback , including that from the BJP . It will be seen what the problems were , '' they said .
The second focus will be on the youth and how to get them associated directly with the RSS .
`` It will be seen what number has been added in the last one year , because otherwise it wo n't even help the BJP , '' the RSS functionary said .
The focus would also be on 'shakhaas ' being organised by the RSS , they said , adding , `` If shakhaas are strong then there is no need to look for the workers.It 's not about statistics , but the real situation on the ground . ''
Natalie Bennett is to step down as leader of the Greens this summer , after saying they believed they had established their party as a national force while acknowledging that they were not a “ spin-trained , lifelong politician ” .
They will remain leader until the end of August when their second two-year term expires , but said they were making the announcement now to allow possible successors plenty of time to come forward .
The Green leader , who took over from the better known Caroline Lucas , came to national prominence during last year 's general election campaign , when they appeared in the televised party leaders ' debates alongside David Cameron and Ed Miliband .
However , they were forced to apologise to members after an excruciating radio interview in which they failed to explain Green party policies , which they put down to “ brain fade ” and suffering a cold .
Reflecting on their time as the head of the party , Bennett said : “ There have been times when I got things right , and times when I got things wrong , but that 's because I 'm not a smooth , spin-trained , lifelong politician , ” they said . “ It 's both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question. ” They argued that sometimes , because the Greens ' policies are radical , they have received “ a very extreme level of hostility ” .

The party ended up holding its single MP in Brighton and bringing its share of the vote up slightly to 3.8 % , but despite growing its membership from 13,000 to 60,000 under their leadership the party ultimately failed to break through as Green members had hoped and Labour had feared .
The Australian former Guardian journalist , who only joined the party in 2006 , said they had always intended to serve for four years , and felt they had achieved much of what they hoped to do when they took up the post in 2012 . “ I started with a number of intentions : making the Green party a truly national party ; growing the membership ; growing the strength of our local parties ; and getting us into national debates . ”
“ In the Green party it 's not a greasy pole where people are scrambling for the top and clinging on by their fingertips : we work as a team , ” they said . “ I think of everybody in the Green party as a leader : we 're all trying to lead us to be a society where we live within our environmental limits , and where no one is left behind ” .
They said grassroots initiatives , such as the “ transition towns ” that are trying to move towards life without fossil fuels , are evidence that the public care about the environment , but real change has to come from the top .
“ The reason I got involved in the Green party is that at the moment they 're having to work against the grain : they 're having to fight all the way , without support from the law , the framework , the funding that should be supporting them . ”
The party secured 1.1m votes at last year 's general election but Bennett failed in their own bid to win a parliamentary seat , standing in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency against Keir Starmer , the Labour candidate and former director of public prosecutions . The party also failed to take target seats such as Norwich South and Bristol West , and lost control of its only council , in Brighton .
The party did not make much headway in the May elections this year , apart from gaining MSPs in Scotland and coming third in the London mayoral elections , and also faces a challenge in how to compete with a more leftwing Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn .
Caroline Lucas , the MP for Brighton Pavilion since 2010 , remains the party 's only representative in the House of Commons . But Bennett stressed that the 123 of the party 's candidates saved their deposits nationwide , a sharp improvement on its historical performance .
They said the party 's strong showing in areas such as Sheffield , Manchester and Liverpool , outside traditional strongholds such as Bristol and Brighton , shows that it has now become a political force across Britain . “ We 've very much grown up , and developed , and become a truly national party . We are now spread right across the country . ”
Bennett was a little-known figure on the nationwide political stage when they appeared in the TV debates , and they believe their presence , along with Plaid Cymru 's Leanne Wood and the SNP 's Nicola Sturgeon , helped to change the nature of the debate .
“ One of the things I 'm proudest of is being able , in those national debates , to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge them about their position on Syrian refugees , ” they said .
They added : “ It really is telling that I was the only one to talk about climate change in those two debates . It 's a real indictment of the other parties when you think about how pressing these issues are. ” Them message was that “ environmental problems are inextricably linked to the structure of the economy and society . ”
They said grassroots activists and members have helped support her , offering their spare bedrooms and their time and enthusiasm as they have travelled around the country . “ I have a fraction of the resources of other party leaders , ” they said . “ Sometimes I have just handed my phone to someone and said , ‘ media manage me for the day ' . ”

Bennett has sometimes struggled to compete with the public profile of Lucas – themselves a former Green leader – who is likely to be a strong contender to succeed them The Scottish Green leader , Patrick Harvie , is also regarded as a powerful campaigner .
Bennett said they hoped another contribution of the debates last year was to make young people realise that women , from different walks of life , can succeed in politics . “ Young women , seeing us all in the debates , thought , ‘ that could be me ' , ” they said . However , they added : “ There are huge problems with the sheer narrowness of where our political class comes from . ”
Once Bennett has stepped down , they plan to spend more time travelling the country – their favourite part of their job as leader – and campaigning on issues they feel strongly about , including education , where they believe the government 's testing regime has turned schools into “ exam factories ” .
“ It does n't mean I 'm going away , ” they said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. manufacturing production recorded its biggest increase in more than three years in April , bolstering the view that economic growth picked up early in the second quarter despite a surprise decline in homebuilding .

The broad strength in factory output reported by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday added to labor market data in suggesting the growth slowdown in the first quarter was temporary . That may allow the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates next month .
“ The sharp increase in industrial activity is a clear sign that the first-quarter sluggishness is behind us . It comes at the right time as home construction seems to have hit a lull , ” said Joel Naroff , chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland , Pennsylvania .
Manufacturing production jumped 1.0 percent last month , the biggest increase since February 2014 , after falling 0.4 percent in March , the Fed said . The surge , which outstripped economists ' expectations for a 0.3 percent gain , reflected a 5.0 percent rebound in the production of motor vehicles and parts .
There were also healthy increases in the output of machinery , fabricated metal products , appliances and furniture , business equipment and chemical products .
Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy . Its recovery following a prolonged slump is being driven by a revival of the energy sector , which is spurring demand for machinery and other equipment .
Mining output increased 1.2 percent in April , contributing to the overall jump in industrial production . Industrial output has now increased for three straight months .
The dollar hit a six-month low against the euro while prices of U.S. government debt rose . U.S. stocks were flat as investors reacted to reports that U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed highly classified information to Russian officials last week .
HOUSING LOSING MOMENTUM
In a separate report on Tuesday , the Commerce Department said housing starts dropped 2.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million units , the lowest level in five months , hurt by persistent weakness in the construction of multi-family housing units .
Groundbreaking activity was also held down by a modest rebound in the construction of single-family homes . Economists had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a rate of 1.26 million units last month .
Homebuilding increased 0.7 percent on a year-on-year basis . Building permits fell 2.5 percent in April .
While the weakness in residential construction implies a slowdown in homebuilding investment , the Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter .
The economy grew at a pedestrian 0.7 percent pace in the first three months of 2017 .
Demand for housing remains underpinned by a tightening labor market , characterized by an unemployment rate at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent . A survey on Monday showed homebuilders ' confidence rose in May amid bullishness about sales at the current time and over the next six months .
The underlying strength in the housing market helped Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) , the No . 1 U.S. home improvement chain , to report a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and same-store sales on Tuesday .
Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe 's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) have remained a bright spot in the retail sector as a firming economy and higher wages drive new home sales and a rise in the value of existing houses spurs remodeling activity .
Single-family homebuilding , which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market , rose 0.4 percent to a pace of 835,000 units last month , failing to recoup all of March 's 5.1 percent decline .
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment dropped 9.2 percent to a pace of 337,000 units . Multi-family starts have declined for four straight months , suggesting that rental increases have probably peaked .
Homebuilders are failing to take advantage of a chronic shortage of properties for sale amid complaints about expensive building materials and shortages of lots and labor .
“ Homebuilding still requires manual labor as a key input into the production process , ” said Mark Fleming , chief economist at First American . “ While the need for manual labor may be changing or declining in other industries , it 's very hard to build a home without construction workers . ”

Sam Darnold will most likely be one of the top prospects selected in the 2018 NFL Draft if they declare and their former teammate at USC believes they would also be an excellent pick for the New York Giants .
Darnold is one of the top quarterback prospects in the coming draft class and the Giants currently own the No . 2 overall pick if the season were to end today . Chad Wheeler , the Giants ' right tackle and former blindside protector of Darnold at USC , is a big believer in what the young prospect has to offer .
“ I ca n't foresee the future , but if he 's blessed enough to get picked by the New York Giants , I 'll be like ecstatic , '' Wheeler said , via The Post . “ It would be awesome . They have great mentors here , great coaches . It 's great to get as many Trojans as possible . ''
The majority of talent evaluators believe Darnold has the most upside of any quarterback in their class . Those same evaluators also believe that they would stand to benefit from learning more and the Giants can offer them that . As Wheeler points out , Darnold would inherit future Hall of Fame quarterback Eli Manning as their mentor . The Giants have already stated that they expect and want Manning to return in 2018 and this would give Darnold the opportunity to work behind and learn from him .
Another factor in the success rate of quarterbacks for the Giants and Jets in the New York market comes down to how well they can handle the media . Wheeler believes that Darnold is well-equipped to deal with the constant and intensive cycle .
“ This is another level , but SC is a pretty big media , you 're in the spotlight there as well , so I think the transition for them would be pretty easy , '' Wheeler said . “ He 'll have to adjust to it , especially what they do outside , everyone 's safe here , but like off the facility grounds , that 's where players get in trouble . I believe they could handle that great . He 's a good dude . '
“ He 's a quiet guy , humble , '' Wheeler said . “ He 'll get you right , but he 's just ready to get the job done . Nothing shocks him , it looks like he 's seen everything . That 's always good when a quarterback has poise like that . It 's like we give them strength , they give us strength so we feed off each other 's game . ''
Wheeler says they first knew Darnold would be special when they saw them scrambling around in practice and making insane plays while on the run .
“ Doing the same exact throws , scrambling like that , we knew they were gon na be a baller , '' Wheeler said .
The Giants offensive tackle also talked about the impressive run Darnold led USC on during their first-year student season that included a nine-game winning streak to end the season and a 52-49 thrilling Rose Bowl victory that will always be remembered .
“ We just went on a run , '' Wheeler said . “ It was like part of their character , perseverance and just their dedication really elevated our offensive game . '
“ I remember the last drive of the Rose Bowl , they had this throw to Deontay Burnett after we drove it down like 40 , 50 yards , we were on like the 20 , 25 or so , the ball was right where it needed to be for Deontay to make the catch and for the defender to not get in the way or make a pick , '' Wheeler said . “ It was a great throw . Touchdown . ''
Wheeler did n't hesitate to deliver a thorough scouting report on Darnold .
“ He 's a physical quarterback specimen , '' Wheeler said . “ He played linebacker in high school . He 's not afraid to get their hands dirty , especially in the run game , you always see them diving forward , getting that extra yard , not sliding as much , but they 're gon na tell them to slide more , obviously . I think they make tackles if they throw picks . He 's a football player . ''
The Giants have cleaned house and now they need a new coach and general manager , Do n't miss any of the news on changes , take a second to sign up for our FREE Giants newsletter !
According to Wheeler , Darnold is nowhere close to the quarterback they will eventually become .
“ This man 's ceiling is through the roof , '' Wheeler said . “ Where they are now , you ca n't tell where he 's gon na be in two , three years . ''
Wheeler protected Darnold 's blindside as a Senior when Sam was just a first-year student and now there 's an outside chance that they will eventually be protecting them again .

Ugh I broke the first rule of writing . Pretend I did n't write that intro . First I have to tell you why you want to learn about them . I should have written an intro that tells you algorithms are everywhere , and that they affect you personally every day . Then , I should have said something like , “ plus , they are taking your jobs ! ” Oh man , you would have been so hooked then . Just pretend I wrote that .
The truth is , algorithms are super powerful , and you already know a bunch . Do you remember when you learned how to add and subtract ? Guess what . You learned an algorithm for each . You did n't really learn shit about math . Your teacher just taught you an algorithm that computes solutions to addition and subtraction problems . The same is true for multiplication , division , and probably everything else you think of as “ math . ”
See , an algorithm is a “ way to solve a problem. ” But it is a special way , because it is very specific , and it always works . Here 's the algorithm you probably learned for adding :
1 . Stack the numbers and align them on the right . Draw a line under the bottom number .
2 . Start at the right-hand side of both numbers .
3 . Add the stacked digits , using mental math or your fingers , writing the results beneath them . If the result is 10 or more , write only the right-hand digit .
4 . Move left , and if the last result was 10 or more , write the 1 above the new stack of digits .
5 . Repeat 3 and 4 until you ca n't go left anymore .
6 . The answer is beneath the line .
A little bit hairy when you spell out all the details . You probably do n't even think about the process anymore , but just do it reflexively . Try to write out the algorithm you use to multiply two numbers together . It 's kinda nasty , but you can use it with no problem . So , you 've got a pretty good handle on a few algorithms . Let 's just memorize the rest so that they ca n't take our jobs . How many more could there possibly be ?
Um , a shitload . But that 's okay , because once you learn the basics and get a feel for how things work , you can sort of branch off on your own and cook them up as you need them . I want to help you shift from “ memorize algorithms and apply them , ” to “ think algorithmically. ” If algorithms are magic , then you 're a wizard , Harry . You have the power .
Did you know that when you mow the lawn you are executing an algorithm ? It is probably something like , “ Start on the perimeter of uncut grass . Mow around the perimeter , then move inward to the new perimeter of uncut grass . Continue until the perimeter is 0. ” Boom , long grass problem solved , every time . There are other ways to mow the lawn , some better than others . I never liked mowing the lawn , but I always had to do it . When I was 14 I mowed the words “ HELP ” in the lawn . This was a bad way to mow the lawn .
Some algorithms make tasties .
At this point , you are probably thinking , “ Okay , so algorithms are n't so scary . They are just really boring. ” First of all , that 's a really mean thing to think . Second of all , is science cool ? Is rationality cool ? Because guess what . The scientific method is an algorithm . Or rather , a class of algorithms . Rational decision making is a class of algorithms . Now who 's boring ? !
The scientific method is a way of thinking that solves the problem of “ not knowing what shit is true , and not knowing how shit works. ” Rationality is a way of thinking that solves the problem of “ good shit does n't happen for me as often as I 'd like. ” If you approach these problems systematically and carefully , breaking them down into pieces and dealing with those pieces step by step , then you are thinking algorithmically , and you are cool .
Here is the science algorithm :
1 . Wonder about something .
2 . Come up with a reason for why that thing might be .
3 . Come up with an experiment that tests your reason .
4 . Observe the experiment .
5 . Analyze the results of the experiment .
6 . Come up with a better reason , and repeat 1 – 5 , until you have a really good reason .
Here is the rationality algorithm :
1 . Want something .
2 . Think about what things you can do right now .
3 . Imagine doing those things , and then think about what you could do next .
4 . If doing several things in a row gets you closer to what you want , remember that chain of things .
5 . Find the best chain of things that gets you closer to what you want .
6 . Do that chain , then repeat steps 1 – 5 , until you have what you want , or you want something else .
There are various specific versions of these ( I actually think the science algorithm is a version of the rationality algorithm ) , and shortcuts to avoid common problems and save time . But the output to the science algorithm is always a tentative belief , and the output to the rationality algorithm is always a strategy . But you could basically try your best to follow those two algorithms , and your life would probably get better .
“ But Seth , those two algorithms are really vague ! You said algorithms are supposed to be specific ! What counts as a good reason ? What counts as the best chain of things ? How do I just come up with an experiment ? There are like an infinite number of things I can do right now , so how am I supposed to imagine doing them all ? ”
Very good point , and very good questions . Now you are thinking algorithmically . You have a goal : live by the rationality/science algorithm . You are breaking that goal down into its pieces , looking at what each step requires . That generates new subproblems . You 've got to solve those subproblems somehow . The way you solve them will depend on the specifics of your main problem . And sometimes , you 've got to plan on making changes to your plan , or to fill in details as you go along .
The rationality algorithm can take a really long time , and gets really complex after only a few levels of action . Think about chess . We are amazed by people who can think three or four moves ahead . Clearly they are n't using the rationality algorithm to reason all the way to checkmate from the beginning of the game . They are using good heuristics to ignore a bunch of possible moves.You can speed things up by figuring out good heuristics to ignore actions . For example , you might have a heuristic that says , “ control the center early on , ” or “ if you have more pieces , make a bunch of even exchanges. ” These are shortcuts through the rationality algorithm applied to chess . Similar shortcuts exist for lots of problems .
The real world is messy , vague , random , and fast . It is in no way ideal . You have almost no control over anything . You 've got to develop good heuristics , learn from both your mistakes and others ' , and think quickly . You 'll face problems constantly . To solve them , you 've got to see them clearly , understand them , break them into manageable chunks , form a plan , and execute the plan . In short , you 've got to algorithm .

The dusty streets of Kismayo in Somalia echoed to the sound of a vehicle with loudspeakers summoning residents to a new form of public `` entertainment '' earlier this month . People were being invited to see a man have their hand chopped off in a public park in the city . The young man , Mohamed Omar Ismail , had been found guilty of stealing goods from another man 's house . That afternoon , hundreds of local people flocked to Freedom Park in order to see the amputation . After a long wait , Mr Ismail was brought out in front of the people and an official started to read out the court decision from a piece of paper . Clothes theft `` The Islamic Sharia court of Kismayo district confirms that Mohamed Omar Ismail has been found guilty of stealing , '' the official announced . `` Mr Ismail stole 10 pairs of trousers , 10 shirts , eight other items and a bag . The value of all the items is estimated to be $ 90 . '' The official quoted a chapter from the Koran known as Surah Maida , verse 38 , which is about stealing and relevant punishment . They said that the verse decreed that punishment for stealing was that the right hand of the thief should be cut off . A local journalist who witnessed the events unfold saw a shocked-looking Mr Ismail brought into the park . Their right hand was held up to the crowds . It was then laid on a table and severed immediately and without ceremony at the wrist . Bloody hand dangled The eyewitness told of their horror as the bloody body part was dangled by its index finger in front of the crowd to prove that punishment had been meted out . Mr Ismail is now recovering from their injury in Kismayo General Hospital , where they are being guarded by the Islamist militia who punished him . Mohamed Omar Ismail reportedly insists they did not commit the burglary They do not allow them to talk to the media . But according to an independent source , Mr Ismail insists they did not commit the burglary for which they lost their hand . They said they were still appalled at what had happened to them and the terrible pain they had suffered . Although there have been several executions and a number of public floggings meted out in the swathes of central and southern Somalia currently controlled by hardline Islamists , this is believed to have been just the second amputation this year . Michelle Kagari , of Amnesty International 's Africa programme , said : `` Punishments like these illustrate the extent to which violence still substitutes for the rule of law in many areas of Somalia . '' They said they wanted the United Nations to take concrete steps to stop such human rights abuses , and that an independent commission of inquiry or similar mechanism should be set up to investigate . 'Due process ' Amnesty International has also called on the fragile Somali transitional government - and the militias which currently run Kismayo and other parts of the south - to publicly condemn all human rights abuses , including punishments carried out without due process of law . It is believed to have been the second amputation in Somalia this year But the Somali government is more preoccupied struggling to withstand the latest onslaught by the opposition radical alliance of the Islamic party ( Hisbul-Islam ) and al-Shabab . On Sunday , fighters from the al-Shabab group , which is linked to al-Qaeda , took the key town of Jowhar from government forces . A spokesperson for the group said Sharia would be imposed there . Earlier this year , the Western-backed moderate Islamist government based in Mogadishu announced the introduction of Sharia law throughout the country . But this failed to appease the hardliners , who follow the Wahhabi school of Islam , based on a more rigid reading of Islamic texts , rather than the mainstream Sunni faith practised by most Somalis . Alien culture Amputations and the recent stoning to death of a 13-year-old mentally disabled girl are shocking displays of al-Shabab 's interpretation of Islamic law . And their writ extends into everyday life . Correspondents say Somalia is sliding deeper into chaos Now , women who do not wear hijab in al-Shabab-run areas are prohibited from leaving their homes . They are instructed to cover themselves from head to toe . No part of their body is permitted to be seen in public . This culture is alien to many Somali women , particularly those in rural areas who work in farms or herd goats , sheep and cattle . These women work very hard under the scorching sun and wearing such dresses makes their already difficult life harder still . But their fear of the new administrators means they have no other option but to comply . There are reports that local women , who are not well off , are going to tailors and markets to buy these dresses . The robes are locally known as jalaabiibs and cost between $ 12 and $ 15 ( £9.70 ) . Amnesty International say opposition leaders in Somalia carry out punishments without any oversight or accountability . But the harsh punishments and killings that take place are unlikely to end while the government , the Islamists and now the Ethiopians struggle to control the country .

In 'Bright Ideas : Global Trends in Solar Finance , ' DNV GL draws upon the front-line experience of its solar experts working on five continents across all major solar market segments . The paper describes major trends in solar financing , defining what is needed to ensure technical risks are properly assessed . Furthermore , it looks beyond the current horizon to reflect upon what the future holds for solar energy finance . Real-world reference cases are also highlighted in the paper .
“ The growth of solar energy in recent years has been built on innovation in both technology and manufacturing , ” says Ray Hudson , DNV GL solar service line leader . “ Another type of innovation that is just as important is innovative finance models . Access to significant amounts of efficient capital is vital to support continuing growth . In addition to financial innovation , there 's also the crucial task of quantifying the risks associated with the technology and practices at the heart of the business . ”
The new paper focuses on four major trends in solar finance :
Securitisation
Securitisation refers to the process of converting a pool of illiquid assets into tradable securities . In the case of solar PV projects , a portfolio of residential and/or commercial scale systems is assembled and asset-backed securities are issued and rated based on the combination of underlying cash flows .
New sources of debt and equity
Placing the ownership of a large number of solar projects into liquid and publicly tradable vehicles provides investment avenues suitable for a wider range of investors and deepens the pool of capital available to developers . Due to the nature of solar assets – namely , the predictable cash flows – these vehicles can raise equity at rates similar to the cost of debt .
New routes to market
As diverse solar assets are being combined to create investment products attractive to new sources of capital , the way that solar PV projects interact with electricity markets is undergoing its own revolution . Alternative offtake structures such as direct sales and even merchant solar plants are on the rise . The traditional role and model of a power utility is being challenged with new types of off-takers stepping in .
Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding sees project promoters using online platforms to directly connect with small investors looking for an investment return . In essence , crowdfunding allows investment decisions to be made collectively by potentially millions of people rather than by traditional financier credit committees .
One of the easiest and best tasting ways of enjoying fruit in the summer is to make a crisp . They are also good for using up less than perfect fruit . I 've been making at least one crisp a week this summer , starting with apricots , then sunset coloured mixes of apricots and plums , then peaches . The latest amazing local fruit to turn up at the markets has been bunches of very round and purple seedless grapes . They are eaten by squeezing them out of their sour skins and have a deep grape flavour . I 've never made anything with cooked grapes before but wanted to try them in a crisp .
Making a crisp is more of a technique than a recipe : peel and chop fruit into the pan ; add a little sweetener ; add minute tapioca to thicken ; make and sprinkle the topping ; bake . I do n't use a lot of sugar for either the filling or the topping ; it is meant to be a breakfast or snack , not dessert . I peeled a large bunch of grapes into a glass pan ( 8X8 pan would work ) and drizzled them with 2 tbs honey . I figured I had about three and a half cups of filling plus juice , so stirred in two heaping tablespoons of minute tapioca . The grapes were really juicy so I put them in the oven to bake for ten minutes at 350 degrees , covered with foil . ( If your filling is too juicy when you put on the topping , the topping will sink into it . ) Meanwhile I rubbed together the crisp topping . An estimate of the ingredients : 1 cup flour , 1/2 cup large flake oatmeal , 2 tbs icing sugar , 2 tbs butter , 1/2 tsp salt . I took the crisp , which was starting to thicken , out of the oven , sprinkled the topping over the surface and returned the pan to the oven to bubble away for another ten minutes .
A perfect-consistency crisp is when the filling just starts to bubble over the sides , like so . Serves 4 .
Given the level of cycling education and interest that most roadies have , I 'd imagine that we 're all very familar with Velominati 's ‘ The Rules ‘ . For the unitiated , it 's a list of tongue in cheek rules for all serious cyclists to adhere to . Breaking some of them make you stand out like a sore thumb in a group but many others are harmless .
In the interests of honesty and confession , there 's a few I just break without caring , effort and forethought .
The Rules
Rule # 1 – Obey the Rules
We 're off to a good start…
Rule # 14 – Shorts should be black
Style has repeatedly suggested that black is the best colour . The lesson learnt from the production of Beetle Vale Velo Club kit was that green is a terrible shorts colour – great for you , the view into your inner soul from behind less good .
Rule # 16 – Respect the jersey
Whilst I will never been seen in a Tour de France jersey or the rainbow stripes , occasionally people have had to double-check that I am not , or ever have been , the German national champion .
Rule # 17 – Team kit is for members of the team
Again , I may have the jerseys from when I represented Garmin in 2010 or Cofidis in 2003 , alternatively the internet might have been involved .
Rule # 24 – Speeds and distances shall be referred to and measured in kilometres
Whilst I can convert between the two happily by dividing and multiplying with 5s and 8s , the British side of me always wins over and miles will always win . Audaxes however are the one and only time the Garmin will actually be set to kilometres due to the sheer barrage of metric data .
Rule # 26 – Make your bike photogenic
Many people have seen my carbon repair…it 's not pretty , it looks like a sludge of carbon fibre set upon the junction of the chainstay and seatstay .
Rule # 29 – No European Posterior Man-Satchels
I use a huge massive red bag that projects itself out a fair bit , primarily for Audaxes where you want one of everything , just in case .
Rule # 31 – Spare tubes , multi-tools and repair kits should be stored in jersey pockets
One action , two rules broken .
Rule # 33 – Shave the guns
I 've seen the video , I know it does actually help but I 'm also aware it will eat into my non-bike time in such a way that I ca n't make the effort . Plus I 'm not married and I have been reliably informed by Tinder 's finest that hairy is best .
Rule # 37 – The arms of the eyewear shall always be placed over the helmet straps
Always always inside , can not understand the justification , can not comply .
Rule # 49 – Keep the rubber side down
All punctures or mechanical bashing is so much easier by turning the bike upside down , whilst remembering to take the Garmin off first . You only do that once , regret the scratches and then remember forever ( just like learning to ride clipless ) .
Rule # 56 – Espresso or macchiato only
Cafe Nero knows full well I 'll have a latte post-ride , steamed frothy milk is the reward for getting flogged on Tardebigge each week .
Rule # 60 – Ditch the washer-nut and valve-stem cap .
Without the nut the valve rattles around the rim weirdly . Caps I can do without . Fun fact , I 've recently had a doctor and a Masters student tell me that the cap 's job is to keep air in the tyre .
Rule # 62 – You shall not ride with earphones
Yeahh I do this but the absence of Beiber and Carly-Rae Jepsen makes it alright . The carefully selected brand of non obvious indie bands lends itself to credibility .
That 's it .
If anyone actually does adhere to the all the rules , they 're certainly not enjoying themselves on the bike and take themselves too seriously .
Remember the scene in Apocalypse Now where Marlon Brando 's character , the crazed Colonel Kurtz , tells Captain Willard ( Martin Sheen ) of the shock they felt upon realizing the strength of their enemies ?
“ And then I realized… like I was shot… like I was shot with a diamond… a diamond bullet right through my forehead . And I thought : My God… the genius of that . The genius . The will to do that . Perfect , genuine , complete , crystalline , pure . And then I realized they were stronger than we . ”
That same bullet struck me recently while reading Naomi Klein 's “ The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. ” Them argument : that the U.S. government and now , ever increasingly , multinational corporations not only view disasters as fortune-making opportunities but actually work to hasten the onset of such opportunities , whether through coups , economic strong-arming or willful neglect ( think New Orleans ) .
Suddenly , it struck me that some of the world 's power players might be viewing climate change the same way . Maybe some corporate and political leaders see rising sea levels , widespread drought and global destabilization not as outcomes to be avoided but as opportunities to be exploited for maximum profit . How else to explain the continued surge of cash to climate skeptic groups and the ongoing rush to build more and more coal-fired power plants ?
I put that question to author/activist Bill McKibben ( “ The End of Nature , ” “ Deep Economy ” ) during a recent blogger conference call , and discovered I 'm not the only one with that concern .
“ It 's a very real possibility , ” McKibben said . “ Disaster capitalism is strong . It 's a signal of the kind of bottom-feeding we 've allowed our economy to descend to . ”
McKibben says they see some potential for change in the coming U.S. presidential elections , though not if the office goes to either John McCain or Hillary Clinton .
“ ( Barack Obama ) may be a necessary precondition , ” McKibben said . “ Who knows whether he 'll be able to reign in the Halliburtons of the world ? ”
The greatest and best hope for change , McKibben said , lies with us — individuals acting for change at the local level and mobilizing on a global scale via the Internet . And the issue of climate change , they added , is the one rallying cry most likely to inspire us to act . That 's why they launched StepItUp in 2007 . And that 's why he 's leading the 350 Challenge ( as in 350 parts per million of atmospheric carbon dioxide ) now .
“ It takes every bit of cleverness we can get from people , ” McKibben said . “ The path in front of us is pretty darn daunting . ”

Card Types :
The following types of cards are available : Standard , FORTRAN Statement , COBOL , DATA and SYMBOLIC .
The FORTRAN card provides special fields in columns
• 1–5 ......... `` Statement Number '' , also used to indicate a comment by the character `` C '' ,
• 6 ............. `` Continuation '' , used to identify a card as a continuation of the previous card/statement ,
• 7–72 ....... 66 columns to hold the FORTRAN statement ( s ) ,
• 73–80 .... `` Identification '' , used for sorting or collation , ignored by the FORTRAN compiler .
The first tab-stop in FORTRAN-mode is at column 5 ( before column `` Continuation '' ) , any other tab-stop is at every 6 columns , providing another stop just at the beginning of the identification field .
To advance on a fresh card to the start of a normal FORTRAN statement , hit < TAB > twice .
The COBOL card provides special fields at columns
• 1–6 ......... Line sequence number ,
• 7 ............. Continuation mark , comment ( asterisk ) , debug mark , or form-feed ,
• 8–11 ....... Area `` A '' , division names , section names , paragraph names , FD entries , 01 level numbers must go here ,
• 12–72 ..... Area `` B '' for more program text
• 73–80 .... `` Identification '' ( OS-sequence number ) , used for sorting or collation , ignored by the compiler .
Suitable tab-stops are provided in COBOL-mode to advance to the next field .
Inside area `` B '' tab-stops are at every 10th punch column .
Card identificators / OS-sequence numbers ( columns 73–80 ) used for programs were usually of the following form :
• Columns 73–75 : program/problem number ,
• Columns 76 , 77 : page number of coding sheet ,
• Columns 78–80 : card number .
The `` Standard '' card is just a plain card without special markings . The DATA card is quite similar with imprints for the usual 10-columns data fields . For these cards tab-stops are provided at every 10th column .
Finally , the SYMBOLIC card is a card for vintage assembler coding .
Multiple Punches / Overpunching :
Press the “ MULT PCH ” key ( keyboard equivalent : ESC ) to enter multiple-punch-mode .
Now enter any number keys ( 0–9 ) for the regarding rows , or the hyphen ( - ) for row 11 , or the ampersand ( & ) for row 12 . ( Rows 11 and 12 are located between the printing zone at the very top and row 0 ; see the illustration below . )
Release “ MULT PCH ” to advance to the next column .
Note : Using the virtual keyboard you may also use `` : '' for `` & '' in “ MULT PCH ” -mode , so all zones may be addressed by the first row of keys without any modifiers .
Punch Card Zones and the IBM 029 Code ( “ Hollerith Code ” ) :
( use `` & '' – `` 9 '' for multiple-punch-mode )

For IBM/360 column binary format equivalents see below .
URL-parameters :
• q= < text > – the card will be automatically punched with the given text . • t= < text > – synonym for parmeter “ q ” .
E.g. , Get Don Draper 's card by this link .
• b= < base64-encoded-text > – optionally the text may be base64-encoded in order to not disclose the message early .
This method is used by “ The Virtual Keypunch ” for its forward-links .
• c= < card-type > – the only value currently recognized is `` fortran '' for a FORTRAN statement card .
Note : The “ MULT PCH ” key is represented internally by the form-feed-character ( ASCII 12 , URI-escaped % 0C ) .
• Any URL ( `` www ... '' , `` http : // ... '' ) detected in the text will be presented as a separate link in the resulting dialog . Therefor a link to a card may be used to foward a URL . Case will be preserved in linked cards in order to provide working URLs , even if the text will be printed upper-case only . ( If a URL is found to be all upper-case , it will be transformed to its lower-case equivalent . )
• Also , an e-mail-address and/or Twitter-name in the text will be presented as a mailto-link or a link to the regarding Twitter-profile respectively . So you may provide a link to an entire v-card with working links .
• A search-link to Google60 will be generated for any text prefixed by `` SEARCH '' , or `` SEARCHDATA '' , or `` SEARCHTERM '' , followed by `` > '' , `` > > '' , a colon ( `` : '' ) , and/or any number of spaces/blanks .
• A card containing just an arithmetic expression preceded by `` EXEC '' , `` EXECUTE '' , `` EVAL '' , `` CALC '' , a question mark , or a simple equation sign will yield a respective result in the results dialog .
• The `` -e '' Falg Trick : Use the path-prefix `` /-e/ '' to submit a calculation directly in the URL .
For example , call https : //www.masswerk.at/keypunch/-e/2+3 * 25.5 to execute the term `` 2 + 3 * 25.5 '' and receive a nicely formatted card together with the respective result .
• You may also print a lace card with : www.masswerk.at/keypunch/ ? q= * lace
( Mind the leading asterisk ! Synonyms : * whoopee , * doily . If you do n't know what a lace card is , use the search to learn more about it . )
• IBM/360 Column Binary Format
“ The Virtual Keypunch ” supports the IBM/360 column binary format in both LittleEndian ( standard ) and BigEndian byte-order , for manual input and when when called with a URL-parameter as well .
The IBM/360 column binary format uses 2 bytes to represent 12 bits to be printed in a vertical column of the card . The following table gives the encoding scheme for the bytes as they appear in reading direction in LittleEndian-order :
________Byte 1________ ________Byte 2________ Position/row : J K Y X 0 1 2 3 L M 4 5 6 7 8 9 Punches : * * * * * * * * * * * * Bit number : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Dec value : 32 16 8 4 2 1 32 16 8 4 2 1 Hex value : 20 10 8 4 2 1 20 10 8 4 2 1
Note : Rows J , K , L , and M are ignored , rows X and Y are also known as rows 11 and 12 and located between the printing zone at the very top and row 0 ( see row numbers on the card ) . Binary 0 is a blank column .
• Binary Mode By Manual Input :
Press the “ BINARY ” key on the visual keyboard or hit the backslash-key ( \ ) on your keyboard . Enter a 4-digits hexadecimal number for the pattern to be punched and confirm the dialog either by hitting “ Enter ” or by pressing the button “ Enter ” . Please mind that only valid hexdecimal numbers are accepted , the Virtual Keypunch will issue a “ bing ” otherwise .
• Binary Mode With URL-Parameters :
( Use `` q '' or `` t '' for plain-text , `` b '' for base64-encoded input , see above ) .
The backslash character ( `` \ '' , URI-escaped % 5C ) is used to switch from character mode ( default ) to binary and back again . To indicate BigEndian byte-order ( “ swapped binary ” ) , this must be followed by an ampersand ( `` & '' , URI-escaped % 26 ) .
The binary part itself must consist of a stream of words of 4 hex characters representing a 2-byte number each , any white-space is ignored .
Example : The following will make a nice gift card ( URI-encoded , white-space added for clarity ) :
% 5C ( `` \ '' ) = > switch to binary
0004 0004 0014 0014 021C 023C 033D 173D
3F3F 173D 033D 023C 021C 001C 0014 0014
0004 0004
% 5C ( `` \ '' ) = > switch back to character-mode ( `` + '' = space , alt . : % 20 )

Review : Benjamin Clementine , ' I Tell A Fly '
Note : NPR 's First Listen audio comes down after the album is released . However , you can still listen with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the bottom of the page .
toggle caption Behind
`` Behind every lion awaits a lazy dragonfly , '' roars Benjamin Clementine in their fierce , androgynous , abrasively beautiful voice in one of the restless tunes on the extraordinary I Tell a Fly . Throughout this second album – a theater piece-turned-sonic adventure — the pianist , poet and composer takes the insect as their muse , following its circular self-scatterings as it whizzes across borders and sneaks into dangerous rooms . It 's a metamorphosis that acknowledges a particular , modern heritage . In 1915 , the novelist Frank Kafka created their six-legged antihero , Gregor Samsa , as an embodiment of capitalism 's tendency to isolate and disempower its minions . Nearly 75 years later , the critic Greg Tate coined the term `` flyboy in the buttermilk '' to describe how the graffiti genius Jean-Michel Basquiat disrupted the tacit white supremacism of the art world . Then there are the pop stars : U2 's Bono , ubiquitous rock star of Clementine 's British youth , becoming the character The Fly in 1991 as a way exploring the sticky mess of late-century globalization ; and Miles Davis , who ( as Kodwo Eshun writes ) donned `` bug-green fly shades '' for 1975 's electric Dark Magus as a way of `` adapting to the audiomenagerie by becoming insectile himself . '' Miles and Kafka , Bono and Basquiat : Benjamin Clementine recognizes the fly 's language as the common tongue of art made in a world where people 's skeletons have become too soft to absorb society 's blows .
The title I Tell a Fly is the first example of the album 's sneaky wordplay – a play on `` I tell a lie , '' just as `` a lie '' contains the first three letters of Clementine 's keyword : alien . After seeing the phrase `` an alien with extraordinary abilities `` written on their visa to America , Clementine began considering what that designation means across lines of class , race or nation , and even over the course of a lifetime . I Tell a Fly loosely follows a pair of winged creatures as they flit through various border scenes . They visit the notorious refugee camps outside Calais in `` God Save the Jungle , '' encounter a French fascist in `` Paris Cor Blimey , '' and make fun of a privileged `` American chap '' in `` Ode From Joyce , '' which interpolates Joyce Kilmer 's famous corny poem `` Trees . '' Like some dirty Dr. Seussian Lorax , Clementine speaks for the flies , who with their compound eyes can see the connections between intimate cruelties and the evils of empire . The album 's mazelike centerpiece , `` Phantom of Aleppoville , '' moves on the current of Clementine 's piano through their memories of childhood bullying and into the bomb-strewn battlefields of the Middle East . `` Awkward Fish '' matches harpsichord sounds to a grimy drumbeat to make fabulist the story of an immigrant boy in South London . `` By the Ports of Europe '' imagines the influx of immigrants into Western Europe as a version of the Biblical tale of Noah . Mashing up myth and memory , Clementine ponders the effects of imposed borders : around countries , between children who begin as equals but are divided through prejudice , and in their own psyche . `` They say you must become an animal for the animal to protect us , the good animal and so we go to war , '' they sing in the somber `` Quintessence . '' Clementine is , as others have written , a musical George Orwell for our time .
Clementine 's sometimes unhinged-seeming musicality is as dazzling as is their poetic vision . Their lyrical wordplay extends into vocal and instrumental polyphony , accomplishing their goal of generating multiple viewpoints with in each song . The song suites on I Tell a Fly , produced and largely performed by the artist , incorporate a huge variety of sounds , from Clementine 's neo-classical piano runs to Radiohead-style math rock , from multi-tracked choirs of Clementine 's own voice to buried atonal babble , from the Blur-like , accessible `` Jupiter '' to the Soweto beat-grounded progressive rock of `` Ave Dreamers . '' It takes time to absorb the shifting soundscapes of I Tell a Fly – like the fugitive realities so many 21st-century people inhabit , it 's as difficult as it can be beautiful . But Clementine 's exuberantly subversive spirit makes the journey worthwhile , and ultimately hopeful . `` Barbarians are coming ! '' they wail at the end of this remarkable journey . `` Dreamers stay strong ! '' It 's a warning and an exhortation : Follow the path of the creature you want to swat , and you may find your way .
Us Navy / REUTERS Capt . Greg McWherter , commanding officer for the flight demonstration squadron of the Blue Angels , leads a formation of F/A-18 Hornets during the Tuscaloosa Regional Air Show in Tuscaloosa , Ala. , in this March 30 , 2012 file photo .
With $ 85 billion in automatic cuts to the federal budget taking effect beginning Friday , millions of fans across the country will miss out on precision flying by the Navy 's Blue Angels and the Air Force 's Thunderbirds , military officials said .
Blue Angels shows scheduled in more than two dozen cities between April and September are expected to be canceled as part of the cuts , said the team 's spokesperson , Lt. Katie Kelly . The Navy intends to cancel the four shows in April -- in Tampa , Fla. ; Corpus Christi , Texas ; Vidalia , Ga. ; and Beaufort , S.C. -- but has n't made a decision about the rest of the year , hoping to salvage some of the season , a senior U.S. military official told NBC News .
Some shows featuring the Blue Angels already have been called off in the face of budget uncertainties .
The Thunderbirds entire 2013 season , beginning April 1 , has been canceled , the Air Force said in a statement . The Air Force said that all aviation support for the public has been halted , including air shows , trade shows , flyovers and open houses .
The grounding would be a sentimental loss for fans but not as serious as other reductions to defense spending , which President Barack Obama said could threaten military readiness . The Defense Department said the cuts would slash ship and aircraft maintenance , curtail training and result in 22 days ' unpaid leave for most of the Pentagon 's 800,000 civilian employees .
For the Navy , programs such as the Blue Angels would take a back seat to `` making sure ships are seaworthy and planes are airworthy for the war fighters who are operating overseas , '' said Lt. John Supple , spokesperson for the Chief of Naval Air Training in Corpus Christi , Texas .
The news has saddened longtime fans , disappointed city leaders and sparked an online petition to the White House to save the Blue Angels ' season . About 1,200 people had signed as of Thursday .
`` They 're an American icon , and they really resonate in a military town , '' said Ashton Hayward , mayor of Pensacola , Florida , home to the naval air station where the Blue Angels are based .
Stelios Varias / REUTERS Members of the Blue Angels aerobatic team perform during the Andrews Air Show at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland , in 2006 .
Pensacola 's Blue Angels beach show each July pumps an additional $ 2.5 million into the local economy , according to a 2012 study .
`` People plan their annual family trips around the shows and the impact on business is phenomenal , '' Hayward said . `` If the Blue Angels end , it 's going to be a sad , sad day for not just us , but for millions of people all over the country . ''
Shows called off
Air shows scheduled for May at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina , and for June in Indianapolis , already have been canceled , organizers and U.S. Air Force officials announced in recent weeks .
The budget cuts will affect cities from Seattle to North Kingstown , Rhode Island , where the Rhode Island National Guard Air Show draws thousands of visitors to the small town each year .
The city 's Quonset Air Base closed in the 1970s , but a sense of military pride still runs deep . Losing the Blue Angels would deal a huge blow for the show in late June , said Elizabeth Dolan , North Kingstown 's town council president .

`` Everybody looks forward to when they come , '' they said . `` They fly right up over my house , and it 's amazing and emotional to watch . ''
The Blue Angels program began in 1946 and costs about $ 40 million a year . Cancelling the bulk of the performing season would save about $ 28 million , according to Navy officials .
Because of the timing of the cuts , the Angels will still perform in March at the El Centro Air Show in southern California and the Southernmost Air Spectacular show in Key West , Florida .
The 130-person team , which includes seven pilots , consists of members who have served in high-level tours in Iraq and Afghanistan . Should the budget cuts go into effect , the team would be reassigned until there is enough money for them to take to the skies again , Supple said .
Pilot Dave Tickle , a 32-year-old from Birmingham , Alabama , said they were inspired to become an expert naval pilot after watching Blue Angels performances during family vacations to Pensacola when they were a child . They are now a lieutenant commander in the Navy and the Blue Angels ' lead solo pilot .
`` I remember looking up at these shining blue and gold precision aircraft and thinking , ' I want to do that . ' It gave me a feeling of amazement and pride , '' they said .

Nitin Patel +
AHMEDABAD : Amid political drama in Gujarat which has begun right after the new government took the charge , Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti ( PAAS ) convenor Hardik Patel has invited deputy chief ministerto join him.Hardik Patel has said that the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is not giving respect to `` his veteran leader and everyone should stand with him '' .This comes after the Gujarat deputy chief minister , having been stripped of three key portfolios - finance , urban development and petroleum , did not assume office in the Sachivalaya in Gandhinagar on Friday even as many ministers took charge . `` Nitin Patel can join us if the BJP is not giving them respect . They have worked hard for the party , '' Hardik told mediapersons on Saturday morning at Botad where the PAAS is holding Chintan Shibir to analyse the assembly poll results.He added , `` if they are ready to quit the BJP and if they are saying that 10 MLAs are ready to quit BJP with him , then we are ready to support him . I will talk to the Congress to welcome them and to give them a proper post . `` Meanwhile , state Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki has said the `` Congress is watching the situation . After Anandiben Patel , now it 's Nitin Patel on BJP leadership target . '' In Gujarat 's interest , we may form the government if we get the support of few BJP MLAs and Nitinbhai Patel , Solanki added .
Story highlights Errol Louis : Hillary Clinton criticized for passing blame to others in their 2016 loss -- but they have a good point on one score
They say Obama 's buildup of their own political organization starved national Democratic Party of resources to help Clinton win
Errol Louis is the host of `` Inside City Hall , '' a nightly political show on NY1 , a New York all-news channel . The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own .
( CNN ) To the consternation of Democratic foot soldiers everywhere -- the men and women who gave time , toil , sweat and tears , trying mightily to make Hillary Clinton president last year -- the candidate has examined the most serious problems that doomed their campaign ... and concluded that none were of their own making .
`` I take responsibility for every decision I made , but that 's not why I lost , '' Clinton told listeners at Recode 's Code Conference . They then went on to name and analyze a list of people and factors that led to their defeat last November , from ex-FBI Director James Comey to Vladimir Putin .
An ever-expanding set of investigations by Congress and the Justice Department 's special counsel will reveal whether any connections between the Russian government and members of the Trump campaign may have tilted the race against Clinton . Such actions , in any event , would have been beyond the control of Clinton and the Democrats .
JUST WATCHED People and things Clinton blames for their loss Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH People and things Clinton blames for their loss 02:01
But when it comes to Clinton 's touchy accusation that former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee were less than helpful , the awkward but important truth is that Clinton is right .
For years , local Democratic groups have complained that Obama poured resources into a political organization , Obama for America ( later renamed Organizing for Action ) at the expense of building the party . The evidence suggests that warnings from the grassroots were ignored -- and came back to haunt and bedevil the party in 2016 .

The dream of a manned , truly functional hoverbike is a step closer to reality after British and American engineers announced a deal with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop and build the vehicle in the States .
Developers Malloy Aeronautics says its Hoverbike prototype is built to do many of the jobs that a helicopter is used for , but without the problems inherent with helicopter design . Malloy have joined forces with U.S. firm SURVICE , 30 year veterans of defense research and development , to develop the vehicle in the U.S. state of Maryland .
According to Malloy 's marketing sales director Grant Stapleton , “ there are a lot of advantages of the Hoverbike over a regular helicopter . Primarily there 's safety . With adducted rotors you immediately not only protect people and property if you were to bump into them , but if you ever were to bump into somebody or property it 's going to bring the aircraft out of the air . So there 's a considerable safety level which is a considerably high level of safety involved there . The other thing is cost . This is much less expensive to buy a Hoverbike and much less expensive to run . ”
Most of the frame of the original bi-copter hoverbike design was handcrafted from carbon fiber , with a foam core . In subsequent years the technology evolved to such an extent that it was adapted to a quadcopter design .
As a proof of concept , Malloy and their team of engineers built a one-third scale model of the hoverbike in Hampshire in the UK . The team then decided to market the small scale model to help raise funds to continue the development of the manned version .
The full-scale Hoverbike features advanced stability and maneuverability , and can be controlled to fly by itself on a pre-determined flight path , return to home , loiter and follow the controller . It also features a humanoid figure that can be attached to it , complete with mini-cam mounted in its head .
“ It can do so much inexpensively and effectively as a multi-purpose product that can be flown manned or unmanned , ” said Stapleton . “ It 's absolutely ideal . It 's inexpensive , it can carry a decent load , it can get in and out of very small spaces very quickly and it can be moved across continents very quickly because it can be folded and packed into a C130 or onto a ship and taken ; lots of them can be moved around and deployed in the places that you need them very easily and very quickly . ”
The developers also say the hoverbike 's low cost and practical size lends itself to operations such as search and rescue missions , first-responder emergency services , and cargo insertion into confined spaces .
The Hoverbike features unique offset and overlapping rotor blades , designed to reduce weight and platform area . It has guards around the rotor blades to minimize rotor-strike .
At the Paris Airshow , Stapleton and Mark Butkiewicz from SURVICE were joined by Maryland Lt . Governor Boyd Rutherford to announce the opening of an office in the state 's Harford County , to develop the Hoverbike for the U.S. Army .
Butkiewicz explained the U.S. Defense Department 's interest . “ The Department of Defense is interested in Hoverbike technology because it can support multiple roles . It can transport troops over difficult terrain and when it 's not used in that purpose it can also be used to transport logistics , supplies , and it can operate in both a manned and unmanned asset . It can also operate as a surveillance platform , ” said Butkiewicz .
They added : “ We 've been working with Malloy Aeronautics to develop a full-scale version of the scale model in front of me and the next step is to do additional testing and then to design and construct prototypes that meet military requirements . ”
Butkiewicz envisages the Hoverbike being used as a multi-role tactical reconnaissance vehicle , supporting both military and humanitarian missions .
Lt . Governor Rutherford welcomed the deal , which they said would bring many well-paid jobs to the state , and said they hoped one day to try the Hoverbike out for himself . “ It 's a fascinating concept . I 've seen the demonstration , the video demonstration . I think there can be a lot of applications , and maybe I 'll be the fifth or sixth person to ride it . I 'm going to wait until a couple of people ride it before me , ” they joked .
Stapleton insists Malloy Aeronautics will remain an independent company for now and also hopes to also tap into the commercial and leisure markets .
What black magic is this ? The Conservatives are worried about the youth vote ? Apparently some senior figures are so aghast , they 're prepared to rethink their signature policies of stamping on the faces of Harry Potter readers and hurling five-year-olds into the River Ouse .
Jeremy Hunt is among those murmuring that austerity might have reached a natural end , a day after voting to cap public sector pay ( this is the problem with Conservatives : they never take responsibility ) .
Theresa May 's Kammerjunker , Damien Green , believes the Tories should consider something eye-catching , like scrapping tuition fees ( it will never happen… but this is the other problem with Conservatives : all spin and no substance ) .

But Green has at least realised that they 're not completely stupid , these young people . David Cameron fondling a huskie is not going to cut it . The party must “ recast our core beliefs in a manner that captures the prevailing mood of the era ” .
As a borderline young person ( or at least , as a member of a demographic that decisively rejected the Conservatives in the last election ) my instinctive response is : ¯\_ ( ツ ) _/¯ .
“ Not my circus , not my monkeys , ” as that useful Polish proverb has it – a proverb that is anxiously awaiting repatriation to Wroclaw post-Brexit , one of a series of unforced boondoggles the Conservatives have inflicted upon the nation .
But while the fate of said nation remains a source of heaving anguish , there is a certain abstract amusement in contemplating that of the Tory party itself . As a Tottenham fan , I kind of enjoy the lachrymose debates about Arsene Wenger 's future at Arsenal too .
The self-proclaimed ‘ natural party of government ' is in a bit of a fix in the light of the Corbo-futurist youthtopia we saw emerging on the Pyramid stage last week . “ If the party does n't move towards the centre this will be its last spell of government , ” asserts George Osborne , who as Chancellor always loaded the worst of their cuts on the young , on the basis that the young did n't vote .
And as Michael Heseltine shrewdly notes , the Conservatives ' natural enemy is not so much a resurgent Labour party as the implacable hand of death . `` One thing which is just worth having in mind , and you ca n't do anything about it , 2 per cent of the older part of the electorate die every year - they are 70 per cent Conservative . Another 2 per cent come in at the young end of the electorate - they are about 70 per cent Labour… There is n't much time . ”
Death has n't bothered the Tories so much in the past , since they 've gambled that any dalliance with leftist politics is youthful naivety . Do n't people move right as they obtain mortgages , children , an appreciation of Georgian architecture , etc ? Labour 's huge mobilisation of 18-24 year olds has commanded attention ; and these are voters who are unlikely to abandon the party any time soon .
But the swing among the not-so-young is more striking . In 2010 , Labour was 3 per cent ahead among 30-45 year olds . That had grown to 14 per cent in 2015 , and a cavernous 36 per cent in 2017 .
And it 's not hard to see why adults are now moving rationally leftwards . This is the generation who might be expecting now to put down some roots , save for the future – but finds instead declining wages , unaffordable housing , insecure futures , and run-down public services to boot . Education cuts were a common plaint of parents on the doorstep ; they had received enough fundraising letters from their children 's school to be gravely concerned .
This is also a generation who came of political age in the ( domestically ) stable years of Tony Blair 's governments – with little or no memory of previous Labour governments . “ It is vital we teach the young how low Britain fell in the 1970s , ” angsted a Sunday Times headline yesterday . Surely it is more vital that we teach the old how low Britain has fallen in the 2010s ?
My own associations with Conservatives in government are ( dimly ) the sleaze and torpor of the John Major era , the meanness of the Cameron-Osborne years ( compounded by its hoodie-hugging hypocrisy ) , and the chaos of Brexit .
The Conservatives ' assertion that they are the sensible ones is all the more laughable given their fingerprints are all over the most naive and fanciful political project of our times . And their claims to be the ‘ national ' party are shown up by the fact they 've put so obviously put party before country twice in recent years .
It would be the most delightful contrepasso if the party 's cynical short-termism were to result in its long-term destruction .

Is there something wrong with Nancy Pelosi ?
During a Friday appearance before Families USA — the activist group fighting the repeal of Obamacare — Pelosi was seen repeating words , telling the audience when to clap and mistakingly said John Kasich was the governor of Illinois .
Pelosi began by thanking the person who introduced them for their “ recanting of what happened at the time ” Democrats and activist groups rammed through Obamacare .
They recalled telling their fellow Democrats that the Affordable Care Act was going to be a major achievement for government programs , and “ stand there with Social Security and Medicare and Medicare , ” apparently meaning to say “ Medicaid . ”
They attempted to butter up the audience by heaping praise on Families USA .
After attendees did n't clap after they congratulated them for their work , they said , “ When I said we could not have done it without Families USA , that is an applause line for you . ”
They added , “ Applause line ! ” after they said they looked forward to continuing to work with the activist group .
Pelosi even attempted to convey what they thought was a deep point .
“ By the way , do you know who the poorest people in America are ? Infants and children . Infants and children , ” they said .
While Pelosi attempted to underscore bi-partisan support for Medicaid , they said , “ Do n't take it from me . John Kasich , the governor of Illinois said , ‘ Thank God for Medicaid . ' ”
Kasich is governor of Ohio — another flyover state that starts with a vowel in the eyes of a West Coast liberal .
Pelosi flubbed MLK 's name , calling them “ Martin Luther Sing . ”
Nevertheless , the liberal activists gave the House Minority Leader a standing ovation .
THE election of a civil-rights campaigner as Somalia 's new president has engendered a rare wave of hope in a country that has had no proper government since 1991 , when its military dictator , Siad Barre , was overthrown in a coup . “ It 's the biggest opportunity for the country for a generation , ” says a Western diplomat involved in the process . The new head of state , Hassan Sheikh Mohamud , is being lauded as an honest man of peace and pragmatism .
But the dangers and uncertainties of their job were starkly illustrated only two days after their election when they survived an assassination attempt in a hotel where they were meeting Kenya 's foreign minister in Mogadishu , the capital . A suicide-bomber belonging to Somalia 's al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militia , known as the Shabab , blew themselves up outside the hotel , killing several people , including a soldier in the force run by the African Union ( AU ) that has been putting the Shabab on the back foot .

Despite this attack , a steady improvement in security is another cause for hope . In the past few months the Shabab has been pretty well chased out of Mogadishu , though it can still launch sporadic terrorist actions . At the same time Ethiopian and Kenyan troops have been hammering the Shabab from the west and south . An AU force recently captured Merka , a port south of Mogadishu . The country 's second city , the port of Kismayu , the Shabab 's last major stronghold , was bombarded earlier this month by Kenyan troops . If it fell , it would be a big fillip for the new president .
Mr Hassan was not chosen by universal franchise but by a newly established 275-member parliament that was in turn handpicked a month ago by a conclave of clan elders . In a first round of voting , in which 22 candidates competed , Mr Hassan came second to the incumbent , Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , but prevailed over them easily with 190 votes to 79 in a run-off .
Diplomats heaved a sigh of relief at the demise of the free-spending and widely mistrusted Mr Sharif . It is eagerly hoped that the new parliament will be better than its woeful predecessors and will soon choose a plausible government . Previous transitional ones were picked in foreign conference rooms by international fixers—with uniformly bad results .
The challenges facing Mr Hassan are daunting . Despite the Shabab 's retreat , the government 's writ will run little further than the outskirts of the capital , along with a few strategic towns scattered across otherwise dangerous territory . The Shabab still controls swathes of southern and central Somalia . Security in Mogadishu and elsewhere depends on the AU 's troops more than on Somalia 's own forces .
Somali pirates , whose oceanic depredations deter investment and trade on dry land , have been much less successful in the past year , thanks mainly to more effective protection of shipping convoys . A report published by the British House of Lords in late July revealed that eight pirated vessels and 215 hostages were currently held , compared with 23 vessels and 501 hostages at the same time a year ago . Only five ships were pirated in the first six months of this year . But the pirates have not gone away and are alleged to have spent big sums to influence the presidential race .
Somalia has often had false dawns . The much-reviled man ousted by the new president was once billed by Hillary Clinton , the American secretary of state , as the country 's “ last best hope ” . The new man is a political novice . But at least they seem honest , compared with what one new MP castigates as the previous “ government of looters ” . Like their predecessor , they hail from one of the four main clans , the Hawiye .
A moderate Islamist with links to the Muslim Brotherhood , Mr Hassan also won praise for staying in Mogadishu when most of its educated residents fled during the long period of bloody strife . They founded a private university that has flourished despite the conflict ; more recently they set up the Peace and Development Party , which they say is Somalia 's first such outfit . Sally Healy , a British expert on Somalia who has co-authored a report with the new president , says they are “ completely networked into the strongest and best bits of Somali society. ” They need to be .
The GOP platform committee has included a plank in this year 's draft document calling for `` vigorous '' enforcement of anti-pornography laws .
In a press release Monday from Morality in Media , a faith-based non-profit , President Patrick Trueman , a former anti-porn prosecutor , calls the current distribution of pornography `` a violation of current federal law '' and lauds Republicans for approving stricter new wording :
The new language replaces previous platform wording , which only opposed child pornography . It will now read , `` Current laws on all forms of pornography and obscenity need to be vigorously enforced . '' Trueman noted that current federal obscenity laws not only prohibit distribution of hardcore pornography on the Internet but also on hotel/motel TV , on cable/satellite TV , and in retail shops .
In an interview with The Huffington Post 's Jen Bendery , Trueman said youth access to pornography amounted to `` a major , major problem , '' and even caused males in their twenties to develop `` porn-induced sexual dysfunction . ''
`` It 's the Viagra problem for guys in their 20s , '' Trueman said . Young males are now spending `` 10 to 12 years looking at porn on the Internet and masturbating to it , so when they are getting married , they are dysfunctional sexually because their brain maps are changed . They enjoy what they 've been doing for 10 to 12 years . Normal sex is not something that gets them excited . ''
The broader regulation , submitted by Family Research Council president and Louisiana RNC delegate Tony Perkins , also echoes GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney 's position on the issue during their previous campaign for the White House .
`` I wan na make sure that every new computer sold in this country after I 'm president has installed on it a filter to block all pornography and that parents can click that filter to make sure their kids do n't see that kinda stuff coming in on their computer , '' Romney said at a campaign stop in Iowa in 2007 .
In February , Romney lent support to a similar effort in response to a Morality in Media questionnaire about cracking down on pornographers .
The Daily Caller reported earlier this year that Trueman , who served in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W . Bush administrations , had received an assurance from Romney 's campaign that the former Massachusetts governor would “ vigorously ” prosecute pornographers if elected president .

From time to time , my wife and I enjoy a nice glass of wine with dinner . In the summer we tend to drink white wines , but in the winter we lean towards reds . It 's very relaxing and studies show that it 's healthy in moderation . However , there 's no escaping the fact that wine can be expensive . At the higher end , you can spend $ 150 bottles of Opus One , and go up much , much higher from there . However , even if you stick to the “ Great Wines Under $ 10 ” section of your local liquor store , you might find your budget stretched .
A typical a bottle of wine will serve 5 glasses . If you and a significant other drink wine 4 days a week , you 'll consume more than an amazing 83 bottles a year . If your average bottle of wine is $ 8 ( on the cheap side ) , you 'll spend $ 664 a year . This translates to $ 55 a month , roughly equivalent to my cable television bill . The problem is that most people do n't choose $ 8 bottles of wine . Quite often they 'll choose a wine at $ 15 or $ 20 believing that they are getting extra quality for their money . Many times that 's simply not the case .
Let 's look at a few ways to reduce the cost of wine .
Buy in Bulk – Many liquor stores will give you a discount if you buy 6 or 12 bottles at a time . For 6 bottle purchases you can usually save 10 % . For 12 bottles , I often see a 20 % discount . The savings can really add up .

They carry a brand called Charles Shaw that is $ 1.99 or $ 2.99 ( depending on location ) for quite a variety of red and white wines . I 'm lucky that in California , it is just $ 2 a bottle . It 's a decent wine , but some discerning tastes might look for something better . Unfortunately , you ca n't get a further discount by buying in bulk . At such a low price , what did you really expect ?

Avoid the Name – People love the big name like the asupervisorstioned Opus One .

With Two Buck Chuck available to us , the motivation for making our own wine would simply be for the fun of learning a new skill .

Wine Aerator – One of the best ways to save money on wine is to make the most of a cheaper wine . A wine aerator is a quick way to get oxygen into the wine . If you 've ever heard of letting a wine breathe , this is the equivalent .

The mix of clove , cinnamon , and other spices really enhance a glass of red wine . This time of year it can get pretty cold outside . Mulled wine is an excellent way to warm up your insides .
I write so many words on saving money and keeping your financial life in good shape . Often my tips require some kind of sacrifice . This is one instance where the sacrifice is quite small and can lead to big savings .

Rumors and insider tips have pointed to an Xbox One `` slim '' model being revealed at this year 's Electronic Entertainment Expo , and the news was so good , someone at Microsoft could n't wait to spill the beans .
Images found by multiple NeoGAF forum members confirm the news of the new `` Xbox One S '' —and the ability for gamers to pre-order it soon enough . Multiple Xbox sources had recently confirmed to Ars that some sort of `` slim '' system would be announced at this year 's E3 and that a major part of its bulk reduction ( which has been measured by Microsoft as `` 40 percent '' ) will come from the removal of its AC adapter 's `` power brick , '' which will make this the first Xbox-branded console to nix that bulky portion .
The leaked announcement image also confirms news that the Xbox One S will support 4K output , though Microsoft sources have informed Ars that 4K support will mostly manifest in the system 's menus and in any streaming app that announces support for 4K output in the future—meaning , this will not include the kind of hardware upgrades needed to automatically boost current software to 4K resolution . The announcement image also trumpets support for high dynamic range ( HDR ) imagery , a vertical stand , and a `` streamlined '' controller , though we have yet to learn what exactly will be streamlined or changed in that controller .
Oh , and it 's going to be white . Quite white , from the look of things .
The leaked image did not include a price point or launch date estimate . We have reached out to Microsoft asking about the accuracy of the leaked store listing , and we will update this report with any response .
The creator of Ripple and original founder of Mt . Gox , Jed McCaleb , recently made a donation worth roughly $ 500,000 in XRP to artificial intelligence researchers the Machine Intelligence Research Institute ( MIRI ) .
Going on the XRP-USD exchange rate at the time of the donation , McCaleb 's became the largest single contribution in the Institute 's history . Though values have fluctuated and MIRI will not convert the donation into half a million US dollars straight away , it is still a startling amount and could be worth even more if the XRP value rises in future .
At the time of writing 1 XRP , the currency of the Ripple Network , was worth around $ 0.02 .
MIRI
The Machine Intelligence Research Institute ( MIRI ) is a tax-exempt , non-profit organization focusing on safety issues related to the development of ‘ Strong AI ' , or smarter-than-human artificial intelligence . Known as the Singularity Institute until January 2013 , MIRI has a mission to ensure the creation of such intelligence has a positive impact on humanity .
Among its advisory board are names often associated with future studies , Transhumanism and the technological Singularity : Nick Bostrom , Aubrey de Grey , PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and Foresight Nanotech Institute co-founder Christine Peterson . Ray Kurzweil was also a director from 2007-10 . MIRI 's executive director Luke Muehlhauser said :
“ In late 2013 I decided MIRI should begin accepting XRP donations in addition to BTC donations . So I contacted Jed for advice , and they said ‘ Actually , I was thinking of making an XRP donation to you guys… ' I did n't know at the time they were a fan of MIRI 's research , but it turns out that they are . ”
A donation in XRP leaves MIRI with a large amount of money it can not easily spend , so the Institute has a strategy , Muehlhauser said : “ We are converting some of the XRP to US dollars and to BTC through the Ripple network , we are keeping a significant chunk in XRP as an investment , and we are also selling some XRP to fans ( so as to improve our current asset allocation and grow the Ripple network simultaneously ) , ”
Researching ‘ Friendly AI '
Muehlhauser said MIRI would use the donation to help fund the hiring of mathematical researchers to work full-time on sub-problems in its ‘ Friendly AI ‘ theory .
The term ‘ Friendly AI ' comes from research fellow Eliezer Yudkowsky . It is a sub-field ‘ machine ethics ' or ‘ artificial morality ' , which focuses on constraining the behavior of ‘ narrow AI ' systems . Research into Friendly AI aims to ensure any future , self-improving and general artificial intelligence is ‘ friendly ' to humanity .
Machine ethics itself is not necessarily a far-flung or even Singularitarian idea : the US Department of Defense is already working on autonomous battlefield robots and airborne drones , and Congress has declared that a third of the US military 's ground forces must be robotic by 2025 .
There are a few problems more future-oriented Friendly AI research must bear in mind . For example , future machine ‘ superintelligences ' will be far more powerful than the humans who caused them to exist , and thus they and humans may no longer be able to comprehend each other .
Such a superintelligence would also act precisely and literally based on the mechanisms put there by its designers , and would not understand the complexity or subtlety of its human designers ' values ( eg : the meaning of ‘ happiness ' ) .
Ripple , XRP and Ripple Labs
Ripple itself , still “ in beta ” , is intended to be a distributed payment and currency exchange network , and XRP is its native currency unit through which trades are made . While users can use Ripple/XRP to trade any currency ( digital or fiat ) they choose , it 's necessary to hold some XRP to participate .
Ripple has also been known to polarize the bitcoin community , with some seeing it as an evolution and others viewing its central ownership as a form of control that could threaten more distributed protocols . At November 's US Senate Committee hearing , Ripple was the only digital payment network other than bitcoin to have representatives scheduled to testify on its behalf , however , they were absent on the day .
All XRP units already exist and do not require mining . The for-profit company that oversees it , Ripple Labs , does not sell any product but aims to distribute 55 % of the currency and keep the rest , in the hope its value increases as the network gains popularity .
It either is or is n't a bitcoin competitor , depending on your perspective .
Jed McCaleb
Jed McCaleb left their main role at Ripple Labs in July last year , but is still a director there . They are known to have an interest in AI research and development , and the technological Singularity .
They founded the current Mt . Gox in 2009 , converting an old exchange for Magic : The Gathering Online trading cards into the world 's first bitcoin-USD exchange in Tokyo . They sold the site to its current owners , Tibanne Ltd. , in 2011 . McCaleb was also the creator of the eDonkey2000 P2P filesharing network .
Thanks to this history they are sometimes mentioned as possibly one of the real identities behind bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto .

You may , or may not , have ever been typing on Skype and seen your typing indicator ( the writing pencil ) turn into a grey kitty who sticks their paw out . If you have ever noticed this , you might be totally confused about what it is and even more confusing is trying to replicate it .
Here is the story of what that cat is and how it came into being .
That cat is what we called internally the “ cat walking on keyboard ” indicator . They are modelled after my cat Roley , who sadly died a few years ago . The Skype client displays them when it reads some “ paw-like activity ” walking across your keyboard . Those of you with cats can probably picture your cat strutting its stuff across your keyboard as you read this .
Yes . It is quite possibly the coolest non-feature ever . Thought up by a team of amazing people like Mr. Zilmer ( who reproduced Roley in an animated emoticon ) and Mr. Mandre who did the lib work on it . And my small role in it was instigating the team to break schedules and donate their time to fun rogue projects . Ahh , the good old days…
Attempt could come next season , London Olympic velodrome would likely be used
Having recently said that they were considering winding down their road career at the end of next season and then concentrating on a return to the track for the Rio Olympics , Bradley Wiggins has said there is a chance that they will try to break the world hour record .
Speaking to the Italian BiciSport magazine , the Briton talked about the lure of the prestigious track record . “ The idea appeals to me , ” they confirmed , saying that if the goal was achieved it could bring their career to a successful conclusion and also write “ a new glorious page for British cycling . ”
Compatriots Graeme Obree and Chris Boardman brought the record back into vogue in the 90s when they battled successful for several records . When the UCI changed its rules to standardise the equipment to be equivalent to that used by Eddy Merckx when they set their record , Boardman succeeded in setting a new mark .
Since then the Czech rider Ondrej Sosenka set a new mark of 49.7 kilometres in Moscow in 2005 . A relative unknown , they tested positive for methamphetamine three years later and retired .
No attempt has been made on the record by a top rider in the years since , but there are indications that this may change .
In July RadioShack Leopard manager Luca Guercilena told the Swiss television station RSI that Cancellara would tackle the record in the new velodrome in Grenchen .
They said that the attempt would either occur after this year 's road worlds or else after Cancellara 's 2014 Classics campaign .
In June Wiggins ' mentor Shane Sutton said that they did n't consider it likely that Wiggins would chase the hour record . “ I do n't think so . I ca n't see that , ” they told VeloNation .
“ It is something I have never discussed it with him , and I have never heard anyone talk about the hour record . I 'm pretty sure it 's well within their capabilities , but I do n't think that is the sort of thing that would motivate Brad after winning the Tour de France . ”
However in the two months since then Wiggins has done a lot of thinking and appears to be moving further and further away from thoughts of staying on the road past 2014 .
Ten days ago they told the Times that they would do just one more year , then focus on the velodrome . “ I 'm going to continue to the next Olympics and try for a fifth gold on the track . That 's the plan , ” they said . “ Having lost weight and muscle the last few years , I would n't be able to walk back into that team pursuit squad , so I 'm not taking it for granted . But I am working towards that . It would be nice to finish the career with another Olympic gold . ”
It appears the hour record is also a goal between now and when they hang up their wheels . “ It would be wonderful to attempt the record in the London velodrome , known from the Olympic Games , ” they told Bicisport .
They did n't give an indication as to when the attempt would be made , but suggested it could come as soon as next year .
Depending on the timing and also if Cancellara is successful , it is possible that Wiggins would not be chasing Sosenka 's mark but rather one set by the multiple world time trial champion .
These days I see myself as a problem solver . I now understand that my job is about trying to make sense of what is taking place in my classroom and trying to figure out what levers to pull and which buttons to push in order to help the students be effective learners . Instead of explaining away failure with excuses and deficit thinking , I approach teaching with a view to discovering how I can be most effective . This insight has really encouraged me to be creative . And I read somewhere recently that creativity is about making the complex , simple . I like that . The classroom is a dynamic and complex place . Full of humans with competing demands and interests . I need to remove that complexity , remove the unnecessary , remove the barriers to effective learning .
But most importantly , I need to find the humanness . And liberate that spirit . It always exists but sometimes it is hidden and you have to dig around for it . I am now more aware than ever , that I can make a difference . I can make a difference through my deliberate acts of teaching . And that is achieved by building strong relationships with the students . From trusting relationships come good learning conversations . That 's the hierarchy . The foundations must exist for effective learning to take place ; to unleash the real learning .
When National Standards were implemented into New Zealand schools I reacted negatively . My original position , like many with a vested interest in education , was to criticise and resist the introduction of this kind of regime . It seemed as though the introduction of National Standards was part of a shift towards an international trend towards standardised testing in primary schools . The arguments against standardised testing are compelling . Yong Zhao describes the standards as “ too narrow , too impersonal , too linear and too focussed on the short term . It 's a model that stifles creativity and discriminates against many students. ” Ken Robinson describes the need for an education system that is responsive to the needs of a modern world . They argue that the education being offered and delivered by schools currently , is only good at “ killing creativity ” . How could I support a regime that was going to be a barrier to that ?
You can imagine my shock then , when I discovered , that it was John Hattie who was responsible for the introduction of the standardised testing regime into New Zealand primary schools . I had been a big fan of the Visible Learning approach to education for some time . I had been endeavouring to apply the findings of their research into my classroom on a daily basis . How had this situation arisen ? Is it a ‘ situation ' at all , I wondered ? Were these academics actually contradicting one another ?
I now realise that standards and creativity can co-exist in the classroom . I believe my experiences and observations in the classroom over the past few years can validate this . I am becoming increasingly aware that it is not the standards that are the problem . The real problem is in the way that teachers approach learning ( in general ) and how they approach the achieving of those standards ( specifically ) . It 's about pedagogy . It 's not the standards that are acting as a ceiling to effective learning and creativity . That ceiling is being imposed by the prevalent teaching practices . The teaching practices that you will see in the majority of classrooms throughout the world . They are pretty much the same teaching practices that you and your parents and grandparents were subjected to during your time at school .
I no longer fear those “ evil ” standards . I embrace them . Teachers need to see themselves as problem solvers . There are many variables that teachers , as individuals , can have no impact on . But too often those factors are used to explain away the inability to lift student achievement . John Hattie asks teachers to keep asking this one critical question – “ What impact am I having on my students ' learning ? ” By implementing John Hattie 's “ Visible Learning ” pedagogy in the classroom over the past few years , I have discovered that high levels of academic achievement and creativity can co-exist in the classroom . Instead of being mutually exclusive , they can in fact , create a learning environment that grows exponentially .
The good news is that a template for achieving exceptional learning outcomes for all students has been provided for us . It 's all about the pedagogy .

Announcing research initiatives may seem like a flimsy excuse for news , but the fact that Intel 's investing time and money to this tech gives that much more weight to Google 's efforts at reshaping the driving experience -- and in the more immediate sense , it will hopefully expedite the adoption of sophisticated in-vehicle systems . In addition to laying out its objectives for in-vehicle experience and safety , the company is launching an In-Vehicle Solutions platform to reduce the cost of installing infotainment systems for manufacturers . Its lineup of compute modules and development kits should also cut down the development time , essentially making it a lot easier for carmakers to add driver-assistance capabilities to new cars . For you , theoretically , that means cheaper prices for the privilege of in-car entertainment , which is still largely the purview of higher-end vehicles .
Apple 's chief executive Tim Cook plays by a similar but different rule book to that of the late Steve Jobs .
The before and after of Steve Jobs ' death in the secretive and complex Apple tapestry could be comparable to the Old Testament and New Testament of the Bible . That 's not to say that that Steve Jobs plagued Apple with rhetoric , hailing down of `` tsunamis of nunchucks '' or `` valleys of haematoma '' for that matter , despite their occasional torrent of verbal abuse .
It could be that the patent war that Jobs began could be signed to surrender by their successor .
Reports emerged this morning of top Apple executives and Samsung executives meeting in a neutral , demilitarised zone , in a bid to settle once and for all a global patent dispute that has spread to over four continents and dozens of cases , reports Bloomberg .
Barrett writes : `` Cook does not seem to share their predecessor 's passion about laying all foes to waste . Cook appears to view litigation as a necessary evil , not a vehicle of cosmic revenge . ''
It comes after Apple and Samsung engaged in a bitter war over patents , initiated by Cupertino . The revelations in Walter Isaccson 's biography followed where Jobs described how they wanted to `` destroy Android , because it 's a stolen product '' , with them willing to wage `` thermonuclear war '' on it .
Cook went to China , where Jobs refused . Cook ordered Apple to give a dividend to investors , where Jobs distanced themselves from such a move .
Jobs ' reign was just a different style of leadership to that of mild-mannered Cook .
Throw Jobs into a room with an Android developer with a gun and a bullet , and you 'll hear no gunshot , but open the door and you 'll find still a blood-smeared wall . Cook , on the other hand , may sit the developer down and hold them close into the bosom of the Apple family .
But while Apple and Samsung continue to fight , with some winning in jurisdictions over others , while vice versa elsewhere , Barrett concludes that Apple 's case is rocky at best , and on the verge of exhausted .
`` In the short run , the tech giants could save themselves considerable legal fees and distraction if they were to lock their lawyers in a hallway of conference rooms and refuse to release them until they had crafted a series of comprehensive cross-licensing pacts , '' Barrett says .
One of the key complaints we 've seen throughout the legal tit-for-tat scrapping is that Samsung `` copied every aspect '' of the `` distinctive and minimalist trade dress '' of the iPhone 3GS , according to Apple spokesperson Steve Dowling , speaking to Barrett .
As described by Business Insider , `` Every smartphone looks like that now . And a lot of phones looked like that before the iPhone . ''
ZDNet 's Jason Perlow said to me earlier : `` The North Korea vs. South Korea situation will resolve itself quicker . ''
They may not be wrong , but they certainly may not be right .
Apple will eventually have to bite the bullet and accept that it makes business sense to admit defeat , struggle with a slight dip in their extremely high share price for a couple of days -- - a week , maximum -- - and face some short-lived embarrassment .
Though Jobs has passed , Cook could still have the words Jobs said in their biography rattling around their head at night : `` I will spend my last dying breath if I need to , and I will spend every penny of Apple 's $ 40 billion in the bank , to right this wrong . ''
Except , that is , it 's $ 100 billion cash in the bank , and Apple could still lose every penny if it continues to fight an unwinnable war with its closest hardware rival .

Matt Damon in `` The Martian . '' 20th Century Fox Everyone 's a critic , and nowhere is this more evident than in the Amazon reviews section .
Even the most well-respected movies , books , and albums get ripped to shreds by semi-anonymous commenters . It can be truly wonderful to behold .
Earlier this week , my colleague Alex Morrell put together a comprehensive list of the most successful movies of 2015 . They ranked them based on global box-office performance , critic reviews , and fan ratings . In short , these are the films that took over the world this year .
But not everyone was a fan of these films . We combed through the one-star reviews of the 13 most successful movies of 2015 , and selected the best ones .
These 13 reviews are absurd , hilarious , and often completely valid — sometimes all at once . Find them below , along with a rundown of how the movie actually did with the rest of the world :
Consumer-grade Hard Drives In A Server Environment
Brian Beach over at Backblaze has been doing some great analysis on their hard drives lately . It 's good to see respectable reliability numbers from the Western Digital drives since I use them as well . Backblaze , famously , does n't use enterprise-class drives for their Storage Pods ; they instead use consumer-class drives from Hitachi , Western Digital , and Seagate to reduce costs . So far , the data seems to suggest that using consumer-grade hard drives in a server might actually be a good choice .
I 've been criticized by some folks for using Western Digital Green 3TB drives in my server ( which hosts this website ) given that they are apparently the duds off the assembly line that can not spin up to 7200 RPM , or so I 've been told . However , that drive is n't used in production by Backblaze for different reasons .
The drives that just do n't work in our environment are Western Digital Green 3TB drives and Seagate LP ( low power ) 2TB drives . Both of these drives start accumulating errors as soon as they are put into production . We think this is related to vibration . The drives do somewhat better in the new low-vibration Backblaze Storage Pod , but still not well enough .
Ouch . Does n't sound too good for their setup , but my situation is a bit different .
These drives are designed to be energy-efficient , and spin down aggressively when not in use . In the Backblaze environment , they spin down frequently , and then spin right back up . We think that this causes a lot of wear on the drive .
All I use my Green drives for is media storage , so as far as I 'm concerned , going with the Western Digital Green 3TB is a decent choice . Past the initial drop-off ( usually still under warranty ) , the reliability of WD drives seem pretty acceptable for the associated cost . I 'll revisit this once I have a drive fail , but in the meantime , I 'm backing up my drives to Crashplan ( sorry , Backblaze , but Crashplan supports Linux distros ) .

About one week off from the previous estimate , the city to Soekarno-Hatta Airport train is finally set to be launched in early December , depending on President Joko Widodo 's schedule .
PT Railink , the company operating the airport train , has already carried out test runs of the new trains over the past week , with Indonesia 's Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi and State-owned Enterprises Minister Rini Soemarno going on board for inspection . Though the specific date for the official launch of the service has not been set , it should happen in the first week of December .
“ Madam Minister ( Rini Soemarno ) said we must wait for President Jokowi to inaugurate . But essentially we are ready to operate , ” said PT Railink First Director Heru Kuswanto , as quoted by WartaEkonomi today .
Heru added that , pending the government 's approval , there could be a month-long promotional ticket price of IDR30,000 ( US $ 2.22 ) per trip . When the promo ends , the ticket price is expected to go up to around IDR100,000 ( US $ 7.41 ) .
According to reports , once fully operational , the airport train will depart from Manggarai Station , making stops at Sudirman Baru , Duri and Batu Ceper before reaching the Soekarno-Hatta Train Station . However , in the first stages of its operation , the airport train will not depart or arrive at Manggarai Station for the time being until PT Railink opens the route in the near future .
There are 10 airport trains ready for operation , each of them consisting of 272 seats across their six carriages . The first departure from Sudirman Baru is set for 3:21 am each day , with each trip expected to take 55 minutes . The last departure of the day is set for 10:51 pm .
PT Railink estimates that the airport train will be able to carry 33,000 passengers daily in 124 trips .
The airport train is another boost to Soekarno-Hatta 's connectivity . In September , the airport launched the Skytrain , linking passengers between Terminals 2 and 3 .
Live Journal was the one place where Lynn Gilderdale felt safe uttering their deepest , most troubling thoughts . Using a ­specially-designed handheld ­computer , and ­adopting the pseudonym Jessie Oliver , it was on the internet networking forum that they shared their desire to die with their closest friends .
After suffering a severe form of ME which left them bedridden and unable to speak or feed themselves for all of their adolescent and adult life , they had decided they were never going to recover , and wanted to ensure their life would end before total degeneration robbed them of all dignity .
The revelations about their decision were made to their parents , Kay and Richard , and their small group of friends in the last two years of their life . To those who were invited to share their innermost thoughts it was a painful , yet understandable , choice .
Many of them were girls and young women who suffered the same illness ; some , such as Lynn , had been confined to their beds and housebound for years as a result of ME .
`` She did mention to me and very few others that they had an overwhelming desire to die , '' said Emily Levick . `` I recall the time I first read about it . I cried , and then immediately texted her , as they were so afraid that their friends would think badly of them for it , and I wanted to reassure them that I could never think badly of them
`` She had battled for so many years , and was so desperately tired . It was quite literally heartbreaking to read something like that , but I did understand their reasons . I believe I would have felt exactly the same if I were in their situation . ''
Them mother and father were kept well informed of their decision . I Do Not Resuscitate note was placed on their ­medical notes under their own wishes and they later went a step further and directed that a `` living will '' should be drafted in which they stated their wish not to be resuscitated or subjected to any medical intervention if their quality of life was too poor .
`` She knew it was very difficult to talk to me about that subject because no one wants to hear it coming from their ­daughter , '' said Richard Gilderdale , a former police officer .
`` I always used to say to them I was a coward because I listened to what they said and then they would always look at me with a knowing look in their eyes and say , 'Look , it 's never going to go away , dad . ' Them feelings were that they had made up their own mind that they could n't carry on . ''
Yet despite this clear statement of their intentions , and fresh guidelines from the director of public prosecutions to reassure relatives who help the terminally ill end their own lives , Kay Gilderdale was brought before the criminal courts this month charged with the attempted ­murder of their 31-year-old child .
After they were acquitted of attempted murder today amid applause in court , the trial judge joined campaigners , friends and lawyers to ask why was they ever prosecuted ?
Kay Gilderdale was the second mother this year to face a criminal trial for the death of their child . Last week Frances ­Inglis was convicted of murder after giving their brain damaged son Tom an overdose of heroin . Lawyers say the Gilderdale case highlights the fudge over the law on assisted suicide in this country .
While the DPP 's guidelines are ­supposed to reassure relatives of the terminally ill that they will not be prosecuted for assisting suicide , they do not address cases where the sick person is so ­incapacitated that helping them involves the relative taking direct action to end a life , said Saimo Chahal , the lawyer who represents Debbie Purdy , whose legal challenge led to the latest guidelines .
Lynn 's friends say it would have been beyond their comprehension , having expressed their wishes so clearly and their admiration and love for their parents so fervently , to have ­foreseen that the mother who tended to them every need for the 17 years of their illness , would be prosecuted for following their wishes and helping them to die .
A criminal judge , well used to the difficult balancing act when considering any assisted suicide , questioned the necessity and wisdom of the prosecution six months before the Gilderdale trial at Lewes crown court , East Sussex
Pointing out that the accused had admitted aiding and abetting suicide , they invited the Crown Prosecution Service to drop their case of attempted murder against them
`` It strikes me , '' they said , `` that it may not be in the interests of justice to pursue [ this ] when the defendant has pleaded guilty to a substantive count like that .
`` [ Assisted suicide ] is a serious charge that appears to address exactly what happened . Would n't it be better to accept it now rather than let this defendant get tangled up in a messy trial for the sake of some legal mumbo-jumbo ? ''
For the last fortnight that legal mumbo jumbo has been played out in court . Kay Gilderdale , a dignified woman has sat smartly dressed in the dock listening intently as their actions were depicted by the prosecution as an attempt to murder their daughter . They were only saved from a charge of murder because the toxicology tests had not been clear as to which dose of morphine or lethal drugs – the one Lynn administered to themselves or the one their mother administered had killed them
Behind them in the public gallery family members listened as the details of Lynn 's existence were explained to the jury .
Until 14 , Lynn had been a bright and sporty schoolgirl , who lived with their family in Stonegate , East Sussex . But after a BCG vaccination they were struck down by ME and within four months was unable to move from the waist down . As the illness progressed they became bedridden , lost their ability to swallow and was fed through a nasogastric tube .
They communicated through a sign language , which they developed with their parents . In later years they used their computer to communicate online with fellow sufferers , building up a network of friends .
Lynn would frequently describe their fervent love for their mother in emails and texts to friends online . In one , written during one of their many hospital visits they said to a friend : `` You asked if my parents are able to visit and the answer is they actually never leave my side . One of them 's ALWAYS here and mum sleeps here too .
`` It 's because I was treated so horrifically when I was first ill ... so many mistakes have been made with my care here ... mum/dad continue to do everything for me . ''
The dedication of their mother extended to every aspect of Lynn 's life , according to friends . On their 31st birthday in September 2008 , three months before their death , they told them mum how very much they would like to hear their online friends ' voices , as they could n't physically meet them .
Them mother sent emails to a number of friends to arrange the surprise and on the day Lynn watched videos prepared by some friends , and listened to voice messages from others . `` It meant the world to her , '' said a friend .
As the years went on their communications online had become increasingly desperate until in 2006 Lynn began talking about ending their lives . `` I 'm tired , so very , very tired , '' they wrote in one communication . `` I ca n't keep hanging on to an ever-diminishing hope that I might one day be well again ...
`` My spirit is broken '' , they said , adding they would seize the opportunity to leave the world `` with both hands '' .
Them final hours and the acts which led to Mrs Gilderdale being charged , began at about 1am on 3 December 2008 . They picked up a syringe of morphine – which they used daily to cope with the pain – and injected themselves . But the dose was not enough and in the early hours Lynn begged their mother to help end their pain . For an hour Kay Gilderdale tried to persuade their daughter that now was not the time , but their decision was made and in the end the mother opted to help their child carry out their wish .
Over the next 28 hours Kay Gilderdale neither ate nor slept as they helped Lynn die . At about 3am they handed Lynn two syringes each containing 210mg of morphine , which Lynn administered herself . When it became clear the morphine was not enough , and with Lynn now unable to administer any more herself , Mrs Gilderdale searched the house for tablets . They crushed together anti-depressants and sleeping pills with a pestle and mortar and inserted them into Lynn 's nasogastric tube .
At about 2am on 4 December ­Gilderdale gave their daughter two or three doses of morphine and later gave them three syringes of air , in an attempt to cause a fatal lung embolism . They also made a desperate ­telephone call to Exit , the assisted suicide helpline , to ask for help .
At 7.10am that day their daughter died and the exhausted mother sent their ex-husband a text saying : `` Please can you come now , be careful , do n't rush . ''
Hours later Kay Gilderdale was arrested on suspicion of murder .
From the moment their daughter died Kay Gilderdale admitted what they had done . In a conversation with the family GP , notes of which were written for the police , they took the doctor through the last 28 hours of their daughter 's life .
They formalised this admission at a court hearing last July , admitting aiding and abetting suicide , which carries a 14 year maximum sentence . Despite the challenge by the trial judge the prosecution insisted it was in the public interest to charge them with attempted murder .
Simon Clements , head of the special crime division in the CPS , said : `` Once the evidence had identified that this was a case of Mrs Gilderdale , on our evidence , trying to kill their daughter , we were into the territory of attempted murder .
`` So clearly our policy has always been that people are not entitled to take the life of another person , however sympathetic one might be to the circumstances and the state of health of the person concerned . It is a desperately sad case but we have to apply the law as it stands unless parliament changes the law . ''
But Chahal said the case exposed a flaw in the law which had to be addressed .
`` The law does not recognise the concept of a mercy killing attempt , '' they said , `` which is what this case is about – a request by a daughter to a mother to assist them to die , in circumstances where the daughter … was not able to complete the act of suicide .
`` There really needs to be a distinction made in law between somebody like Kay Gilderdale , who was acting out of love and compassion for their daughter and a cold blooded murderer taking a life . ''
Mercy laws
The Netherlands
In April 2002 the Netherlands became the first country in the world to legalise mercy killings . Under Dutch law patients experiencing unbearable suffering are allowed to request euthanasia .
Belgium
In May 2002 Belgium followed suit , partially legalising euthanasia in cases where the patient is terminally ill and makes the decision to die .
Luxembourg
In February 2008 the Luxembourg parliament voted in favour of legalising euthanasia . The Grand Duke of Luxembourg refused to sign the bill into law , and subsequently had their power of veto removed . Since April 2009 a doctor can , after consulting with a colleague , carry out euthanasia or assisted suicide in cases where the patient is terminally ill and has repeatedly asked to die .
Oregon , US
In October 1997 Oregon enacted the Death with Dignity Act which allows terminally ill Oregonians to voluntarily end their lives through the self-administration of lethal medications , prescribed by a doctor .

Sly Cooper : Thieves in Time was recently shown off on the PlayStation Vita .
In the linked article above , we questioned the idea of playing a console game on a handheld system . Regardless of where you stand on the issue , Sony is offering players the choice of experiencing the next Sly Cooper game on the PlayStation Vita as well as the PlayStation 3 .
To that end , a gamer named SuperOrobi has just published three somewhat lengthy videos showcasing Sly Cooper : Thieves in Time on the PS3 .
The first of the videos is titled `` Mechanical Menace '' which shows Sly Cooper decked out in Egyptian-themed gear as they enter a gigantic mechanical machine .
The second video , titled `` Sushi House '' , puts players in the shoes of Rioichi Cooper , a Japanese raccoon who sneaks into a sushi house . They look and moves a lot like sly , but they have the ability to leap across great distances .
The final video , titled `` Juggling Act '' has Sly traversing through a colossal circus tent .
Four posters promoting a white nationalist group have once again been found displayed on the University of Maryland campus , the Diamondback student newspaper reported Monday night .
The posters for a group called Identity Evropa were reportedly found Monday morning on a bulletin board in a classroom building on the College Park campus and promptly taken to the biology department 's office , the Diamondback said .
It 's unclear how long the latest batch posters were on display before they were discovered . According to the University of Maryland 's website , the school was on spring break last week , with classes resuming Monday .
The posters in question depict classical European sculptures and bear slogans like “ Our future belongs to us ” and , “ Protect your heritage , ” according to the paper .
The doctoral student who found the posters “ filed reports with University Police and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion later that afternoon , ” but spoke first with the student newspaper , reported the Diamondback .
For its part , the University Police consider the posters an incident of “ hate bias ” and is asking for anyone with information to contact them .
“ Hate bias ” incidents are given investigative priority by campus police , the Diamondback explained in December , following a similar incident involving posters pasted to campus property advertising a white nationalist group American Vanguard .
Posters for that group , now renamed Vanguard America , were also found earlier this month on campus , according to the Diamondback .

Ten Bits of Advice Writers Should Stop Giving Aspiring Writers [ Jan. 21st , 2012|10:27 am ] Nick Mamatas Lots of these sorts of things going around lately . Some of them are even quite good , but they do tend to be of a type . To those interested in starving better ( now a likely Stoker nominee ) I 've said most of what I 've had to say , but here are a few things for writers in the advice game .
1 . Do n't Give Up
Consider your audience . Who are you telling not to give up ? The illiterates , the douchebags , the certifiable graphomanics , the people who think watching a movie is the same as reading a book ? Some people should give up . Most people should give up . Find out whether someone has any potential first before arbitrarily telling someone to waste years of their lives , and worse , moments of the lives of editors who have to look at their nonsense .
2 . Show Do n't Tell
Fuck you . Is this bit of advice really so precious that everyone has to say it over and over ? Like pretty much any three-word utterance it is oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy . Some things need showing , some things need telling . Figuring out which is part of the spooky art .
3 . Do n't Overpromote Yourself , Especially on Social Media
This is actually good advice , but futile , along the lines of this other excellent piece of advice : `` Stop molesting children . '' If you have to tell someone , they 're probably already beyond hope . I 've even seen very specific protocols suggested like , `` Be sure only every fifth social media utterance is promotional '' or `` Have a change of topic prepared '' for in-person encounters . I do n't want to be stuck in a room with someone who can think of nothing to say that is n't a commercial for their or their own work , but I certainly do n't want to be stuck in that room with someone who can think of something else to say ... thanks to having prepared an index card for the topic . SO , HOW ABOUT THOSE CLOWNS IN CONGRESS ? WHAT A BUNCH OF CLOWNS .
4 . Watch What You Say on the Internet
Really , as long as you do n't say , `` And my Social Security number is ... '' or `` But honestly Monica , the web is considered 'public domain ' and you should be happy we just did n't 'lift ' your whole article and put someone else 's name on it ! '' you 'll be fine in the long-term . You might lose a few weeks of productivity , or some `` fans '' ( who likely were n't buying anything anyway ) , or even a minor market or two , but it is extremely hard to talk one 's way out of a career . This is true for right-wing and left-wing opinions , as well as for generalized all-weather kookiness . Post nude photos of yourself ! It 's okay .
5 . Aim For the Top
The top of what ? The bestsellers list ? Award tallies ? The `` best '' agent or publisher ? In many careers , individual career paths are clearly hierarchical . This is not the case in writing . People with the best agents and publishers have flopped , or worse , have succeeded beyond anyone 's wildest dreams , but remain unsatisfied with their critical response ( e.g. , Stephen King ) . Others make huge critical splashes and are incredibly important , but still go largely unread after their moment has ended ( e.g. , Norman Mailer ) . In the end , critical acclaim or award nominations or giant checks wo n't make you happy . You 're either already happy , or you 're not . Also , any advice about `` the top '' not given by , say , Charles Dickens , is advice that fails to be autobiographical and thus should be treated with even greater suspicion than most advice .
6 . It 's All Subjective .
No , it 's all intersubjective .
7 . Revise , revise , revise .
Lots of people do n't revise and do just fine .
8 . Write every day .
Lots of people do n't write every day and do just fine .
9 . Write that `` a million words of crap '' ; give yourself six years to get published ; collect 250 rejections , etc etc ..
This advice is much like another piece of bad advice—buy pants with a 36-inch waist . Well , the plurality of people wear 36-inch pants , so ... Outside of the basic advice of `` Try , and a significant number of times '' , any specific measure is foolish and leads to aggravation . Back when I was co-editing Clarkesworld , I 'd get a story from a particular writer every week . She 'd been published before , but the stories they sent me were usually half-formed and often terrible . Eventually , I found their blog and found out what was happening—she was playing some goal-setting game where they got points for doing various writerly things like finishing a story , and submitting one . So they just shat out any ol ' bullshit and submitted to me once a week to get extra points . This is how the Soviet Union ended up making tractor engines so heavy they 'd fall out of the machines—they measured factory productivity via tonnage produced per year . Any advice that involves anything other than `` Write something publishable , attempt many times to get it published '' can lead to artificial goals such as the collection of rejection slips or the production of unpublishable stories .
The same is true about other `` advice '' like—write short stories first , writer shorter short stories rather than long ones , join a writer 's group , make sure your characters are likable , write/do n't write for the `` market '' , etc . All of this is `` buy typical pants '' advice .
10 . Writing is like [ some other thing ]
Even writers—especially the newer ones who give advice so freely—like to fall back on something they 're already good at when giving advice . So , writing and publishing is variously like coding , or doing push-ups , or raising a family , or putting on a play , or invading Iraq , or making loooooove , or selling used cars , or like being the best orthodontist in Danbury , Connecticut . It 's not like any of those things . It is only like itself . If you do n't have enough writer/publisher juice to talk about it on its own terms , do n't talk about it .
On Friday , two men , Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche , were brutally murdered while trying to confront someone hurling anti-Muslim epithets on a commuter train in Portland .
The two have been widely hailed as heroes , but not by President Donald Trump — until Monday .
Trump broke their silence with a tweet from the @ POTUS handle . Forgive us if this does n't seem to have come from Trump himself .
The Twitter account of Vice President Mike Pence also jumped in to comment .
The violent attacks in Portland on Friday are unacceptable . The victims were standing up to hate and intolerance . Our prayers are w/ them . — President Trump ( @ POTUS ) May 29 , 2017
Well said , Mr. President . Our thoughts and prayers are with the heroes in Portland and the loved ones they left behind . https : //t.co/M2Zb68ykx5 — Vice President Pence ( @ VP ) May 29 , 2017
`` The violent attacks in Portland on Friday are unacceptable , ” the President wrote . “ The victims were standing up to hate and intolerance . Our prayers are w/ them . ”
The statement was issued to their professional account , not their personal one which most of their alt-right base follows .
Prior to posting the tweet , the president spent days tweeting from their personal account about the issues most important to him , including the fake news media , leaks , false sources and the Montana congressional race .
As of now , the FBI does not yet consider the crime a hate crime . The suspect , Jeremy Joseph Christian , has shared social media posts in the past encouraging political violence and Nazism .

0 Denouncing Portland attack — Tony Posnanski ( @ tonyposnanski ) May 28 , 2017
People could n't help but notice the president 's delay in posting the response , and where they chose to post the apology . Their personal Twitter account , which boasts 30 million followers , is known for its active alt-right base—who may not be happy to see their President tweeting about an attack some in their community find dubious .
The child was said to have wandered away from their village , where around 60 members of the Awá tribe live in complete isolation from the modern world , and fallen into the hands of the loggers .
Luis Carlos Guajajaras , a local leader from a separate tribe , told a Brazilian news website that they tied to them a tree and set them alight as a warning to other natives , who live in a protected reserve in the north-eastern state of Maranhão .
`` She was from another tribe , they live deep in the jungle , and have no contact with the outside world . It would have been the first time they had ever seen white men . We heard that they laughed as they burned them to death , '' they said .
Reports of the killing , which was said to have happened in October or November last year , were seconded by the Indigenous Missionary Council ( CIMI ) , a Catholic group which said it had seen footage of their charred remains .
A spokesperson for the Brazil 's Indian Affairs Department said the government was urgently investigating the claims .
Huge iron ore deposits and valuable timber have encouraged mining and logging companies to enter the forests of Maranhão despite laws designed to protect the few remaining uncontacted tribes , often leading to violent clashes .
Around 450 tribes people have were murdered in Brazil between 2003 and 2010 , according to figures from CIMI .
Survival International , a charity for tribal groups , warned that a third of the Awá 's land had already been destroyed and that their nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle was being threatened as animals fled in the face of the approaching logging companies .

In support of our fundraising efforts for The Innocence Project , I have decided to dedicate at least one post per week over the next four weeks to the cause of criminal justice reform – many of which are the very reforms The Innocence Project are working to bring about . With just 2 weeks left of this fundraising campaign , 208 “ Innocence Partners ” combined efforts has raised over $ 10,000 of the $ 20,000 target . As of this writing , you readers have already donated $ 375 – 75 % of our $ 500 goal ! Thanks to everyone who has donated so far or plans to donate . Remember : your donations are 100 % tax deductible .
One more brief note before I get into this post 's topic of false confessions . Just three days ago , Thomas Haynesworth became The Innocence Projects ' 267th exoneree and was released from prison after serving 27 years for three rapes that DNA tests and other evidence prove they did not commit ( well , technically they were paroled ; The Innocence Project is now trying to have their conviction overturned via the Virginia Court of Appeals or by a pardon from the governor who says they will consider pardoning Haynesworth ) .
False Confessions
A skilled interrogator knows all sorts of ways to persuade individuals guilty of committing a crime to confess . The problem is , the same interrogator 's methods can often persuade individuals who are innocent to confess as well .
But why would an innocent person confess to crimes as serious as rape and murder , you ask ? This is some of what The Innocence Project has learned :
In about 25 % of DNA exoneration cases , innocent defendants made incriminating statements , delivered outright confessions or pled guilty . These cases show that confessions are not always prompted by internal knowledge or actual guilt , but are sometimes motivated by external influences . Why do innocent people confess ?
A variety of factors can contribute to a false confession during a police interrogation . Many cases have included a combination of several of these causes . They include : •duress
•coercion
•intoxication
•diminished capacity
•mental impairment
•ignorance of the law
•fear of violence
•the actual infliction of harm
•the threat of a harsh sentence
•Misunderstanding the situation
The documentary series Frontline episode “ The Confessions ” ( below ) profiles a case where eight individuals were charged in large part due to five confessions for a rape and murder of a Norfolk , Virginia woman . Only one of the five confessions turned out to be true and the actual perpetrator admitted they acted alone .
Watch the full episode . See more FRONTLINE .
How can false confessions be minimized ? One common sense reform The Innocence Project is pushing is simply passing laws which would require all interrogations to be recorded . If the men in the above case had their confessions recorded , the interrogators would n't have the ability to have each rehearse their confessions until it fit with their theory . Every lie and every threat by the interrogators would be replayed for the jury to hear . Only then could the jury have a more complete context of the interrogation .
Additional Thoughts on Recording Interactions with the Police
In response to the above post , Tom Knighton made some very good points in a blog post of their own regarding mandatory recording of interrogations that bear repeating here :
Littau suggests simply recording interrogations as a tool for preventing false confessions as the jury would hear the whole situation and perhaps make up their own minds regarding the so-called confession . I 'm going to go so far as to suggest this as a tool for protecting law enforcement officers , as well as suspects . Recorded interrogations can also tell that an officer did n't coerce a confession , assault a suspect , or anything else they may be accused of . Transparency is always preferable to non-transparency when it comes to government , even in the law enforcement sector . By recording interviews , an agency opens a window on the process and protects everyone involved .
As the old saying goes , there 's three sides to every story . In the criminal justice system there 's the suspect 's side , the state 's side ( or referred sometimes to as “ the people 's ” side ) , and the truth . Recording all interactions between the police and the suspect provides something very close to the truth ( I say close because even video evidence can be limiting due to a variety of factors ) .
Really I think that all police interactions should be required by law to be recorded if the person does n't have access to a lawyer at that particular moment ( and even then , the interaction should be recorded unless the lawyer wishes otherwise ) . Every police stop , every search warrant , and every raid on a person 's home should be fully * recorded ; resulting video should be kept unedited * * so both sides can examine the evidence fairly .
Of course , this all assumes that the purpose of our criminal justice system is to get to the truth .
* In the case of police raids , something that Radley Balko advocates ( which I agree with fully ) is that every SWAT or police officer who takes part in a raid should be required to have a camera mounted on his/her person – preferably helmet mounted . This would present the events how they happened from multiple points-of-view .
* * Editing , destroying , or omitting such a video should be considered a crime akin to any other tampering or destruction of evidence .

Meteorologists are starting to see signs of an impending Polar Vortex sequel that could send the country plunging into a deep freeze .
If you miss the frigid weather from the beginning of January and the fun we had , with the peeing and the supersoakers and the injuries , then you 're in luck . Because the Polar Vortex is back . According to the Washington Post 's Wes Junker , starting around Tuesday , January 21 , and continuing through the end of the month , the weather tea leaves point towards another shot of arctic air creeping down to the U.S. through Canada and engulfing the country in cold .
Currently a weakened Polar Vortex is sitting still over the Hudson Bay , just above Quebec , minding its own business and causing some mild snowstorms . But the Vortex will start moving south at the beginning of next week , and a combination of air systems will create the kind of cold air that bothered much of the U.S. at the beginning of January . Accuweather 's Alex Sosnowski explains :
However , during the third and fourth weeks of January , some changes will take place . The high amplitude pattern is forecast to get more extreme . The polar vortex will move farther south and get stronger . The pattern will gradually change the current mixture of Pacific and Arctic air in the Canada Prairies and the North Central U.S. to all Arctic air . The air will get significantly colder over the Canada Prairies and the much of the eastern half of the nation as a result .
If the early forecasts are right the sequel will be even worse , just like at the movies . `` Temperatures may get colder than they were during the initial polar vortex event , '' writes The Houston Chronicle 's Alex Sosnowski . These frigid temperatures are not a sure thing just yet . Predicting the weather is not a perfect science , especially when guessing so far away . But we know that Tuesday will be very , very cold , and all of the patterns point towards another Polar Vortex-type deep freeze .
We still do n't know how far south the Vortex will travel . For now , most expect the Vortex to affect the Midwest and Northeast .
ENGLEWOOD , Colo. — Ryan Clady , the talented and towering tackle whose nine-year NFL career was checkered with injuries , is retiring from football .
“ I 'm excited about what life holds for me going forward , ” Clady wrote Tuesday on Twitter , thanking the Broncos and team owner Pat Bowlen for bringing them to an organization where they were “ blessed to experience eight great years , four Pro Bowls and a world championship . ”
The Broncos selected them 12th overall in the 2008 draft out of Boise Statewhere Clady made a pivotal block on the Statue of Liberty 2-point conversion play that stunned Oklahoma in the January 2007 Fiesta Bowl .
Among a dying breed of plug-and-play tackles in the NFL before colleges turned so heavily to spread offenses , Clady allowed just a half-sack in their first 20 NFL games . But injuries slowed them down , and the two-time All-Pro missed both of Denver 's Super Bowl appearances in recent years , first with a foot injury in Super Bowl XLVIII then with a knee injury in Super Bowl 50 .
They also sustained a knee injury in the offseason early in their career that robbed them of some of their lateral movement for a couple of seasons , though they did n't miss any games .
Clady signed a $ 52.5 million , five-year contract in 2013 , but played just 18 games over the next three seasons before the Broncos traded them to the Jets , where a shoulder injury ended their 2016 season in November . They underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff , and the Jets declined their option for this season .
Clady said several teams showed interest in them this summer , and they wanted to see if the start of training camps “ would inspire the passion I need to perform at the standards that I established for myself during my nine-year career . ”
Not sensing that spark , Clady called it a career . John Elway called Clady a “ great player for the Broncos for many years , ” tweeting they were “ as dominant as there was as an LT in pass pro . Congrats on an outstanding career , Ryan ! ! ! ”
`` We should follow the example of countries like Germany and Sweden , which had difficult times and carried out a lot of reforms , '' Tirole told a news conference in Stockholm .
`` We should carry out reforms to put people back to work ... and also reform the state as many countries have done . ''
Tirole , who won the Nobel for their research on reining in corporate giants , added : `` If you do n't have a viable economy , your debt grows , and so on , then at some point you have to end the providential state which in my opinion would be disastrous . ''
But they tempered their remarks by saying they `` believed '' in their country .
`` I would not be in France if I did n't believe in France . ''
The number of unemployed in France rose to a record 3.46 million in October , according to the latest official statistics .
In 2003 , Tirole proposed a series of far-reaching reforms to France 's job market , notably suggesting the elimination of short work contracts .
They are n't the only one to lay into France 's attempts at reform on Sunday . Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel said their neighbours across the Rhine had not done enough to put their finances in order .
`` The European Commission has said in a clear manner that what is on the table to date is still insufficient . That 's something that I agree with , '' Merkel said , according to extracts released in advance by the newspaper .

The news these last few days has been all about the radical left being up in arms over Donald Trump 's ascendency to the US Presidency . The massive upset victory of this charismatic non-politician is crystallizing into a very divisive situation in the United States and in Europe , as EU leaders and NATO nations paint a geo-political picture of gloom and doom for us . However negative the picture may seem though , the shiny side of this leadership coin shows a glowing promise . Here 's my take on what is about to happen when Donald Trump is inaugurated .
Donald Trump did not win this election on any of the bases which Clinton 's supporters profess . This is crucial to accept if we are to understand what is about to happen . Trump is not a bigot , a racist , nor is they some misogynistic woman hater . Trump is a product of both American progress and to an extent hyper-capitalism . Their “ locker room ” talk resonates no more resoundingly than their anti-establishment diatribe against the Washington elites . For those who have watched them over the years , it is so clear the man just says what they think at the moment . They said they would “ drain the swamp ” of politically corrupt in Washington , and I think they are about to . They also said , if they were elected , they would install a special prosecutor to investigate and indict Hillary Clinton for their part in illegal activities . Those out there demonstrating do not fully understand “ who ” it is there are demonstrating on behalf of , nor do they understand the breadth of criminality and malfeasance Mr. Trump has suggested . WikiLeaks opened the investigation to the court of public opinion , and this is why Donald Trump is the President-elect now .
I could enumerate the multiple statutes Mrs. Clinton breached while they were Secretary of State , but their alleged crimes and misdemeanors against the United States are not the reason the Democrats lost . I could list the multitude of lies the Podesta emails proved , and how Hillary Clinton told Congress , the media , the FBI , and the atmosphere of crooked dealings they and the Democrats created , but the American people did not shun them for lying to them either . Politicians lie like water flows with gravity . The American people voted for Donald Trump because the system in place the last 25 years failed them .
There 's no need for a history lesson in order for me to prove my contention here . When George Herbert Walker Bush met with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev just after the fall of the Berlin Wall , the people of the world drew in a deep breath of possibility and potential . The promise was further illuminated in 1991 , but the fall of the Soviet Union that was supposed to set free all the peoples of all the nations , it was never the plan . Almost simultaneously with their handshake with Gorbachev , Bush and their backers were steeled for the first invasion of Iraq . Bush 's part in lighting the fuse on today 's destabilization bomb was not their greatest betrayal of the American people though . Not many political analysts these days talk about George H.W . Bush 's role in NAFTA , but step toward globalism ruined a hundred million lives and the dreams attached to them within a few short years . NAFTA , later set in place by Bill Clinton , destroyed the United States as a manufacturing power . Not only did millions lose their jobs , the globalization strategies keyed to NAFTA would later cause the global economic and military conflicts we see right now . An easy way of seeing this is by watching the march of NATO across Eastern Europe toward the doorstep of Russia .
I can show you how Bill Clinton 's administration got Yugoslavia out of the US hegemony 's way . Clinton left office as one of only two US Presidents to have been through impeachment proceedings , and after having paved the way to the coming Iraq invasion . Showing the collusion in between Clinton 's successor George W. Bush , Britain 's Tony Blair , and Europe 's leadership in what became known as the “ Bush Doctrine ” , which amounted to “ Democratic regime change ” . The Afghanistan War , the war and occupation of Iraq , the later Georgian War , Barack Obama 's part in Ukraine , then Arab Spring , Gaddafi , Assad and Syria , the spread of this quasi-democratic movement is well documented by the trail of blood and misery left in its path . Whether the reader wishes to see the march of these successive administrations as complicit or circumstantial participants in this is irrelevant . In the long view the United States ' domestic and global policies have failed billions of people . Furthermore , on some individual level , each and every one of us has felt these failures . This is true of the protesters from Austin to Washington today . These Hillary supporters are by and large , just the pawns of the globalists who pay for play via the US Treasury , and who now fund the very upheaval against President-elect Trump . The Hillary Clinton “ upset ” is a far bigger paradigm than anyone is telling us . At this point some readers are already asking ; “ So where is that glowing promise ? ”
Donald Trump is in the process of emptying not only the “ Washington swamp ” , but the European one as well . Before you object , please consider what it means for a powerful outsider to enter this game of crisis-détente . Look at how EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is expressing the panic of European leadership in this comment this week :
“ We will need to teach the president-elect what Europe is and how it works . ”
News that NATO is losing it over the Trump presidency is brought into context if we look at how NATO is trying to establish Moscow as the bitter foe again . I recall something Mr. Putin said to the Valdai Conference in Sochi in 2014 , when announced ; “ Playtime is over ” . The Russian president was talking about backroom deals and underhanded dealings geo-policy makers had been engaging in for decades , and how they were not engaging in them any longer . This is vital for understanding Mr. Trump 's position with regard to positivity toward Russia and China . The globalists who have run this show for decades are now faced with powerful opponents to their plans . All of this is irrefutable , and only the minute details remain to be seen . The worst nightmare of the billionaires who have benefited from world chaos is now elected . Imagine now what will come out in a Hillary Clinton investigation without the Obama Department of Justice to block ! Donald Trump has at their fingertips every underhanded shift , every bit of NSA intelligence , every USAID or CIA penny shoveled to ISIL , or to some unscrupulous EU official .
Hillary and Bill Clinton , the Bushs , Barack Obama , Angela Merkel , Tony Blair , Cameron , billionaires like George Soros and their NGOs , the whole grimy and messy swamp of leadership corruption is now in the hands of a guy who builds skyscrapers and golf courses . Somebody outside the “ club ” is in the White House and nobody knows what they are going to do . No Rockefeller millions put them there . No Soros funding promoted him , and no corporate media voiced a kind word about him . The opposition to Donald Trump did every dirty , stinking , rotten deed they could to ensure they lost , but fed up America said “ no ” .
The world 's geo-political reptiles are losing their collective minds today . Soros and MoveOn.org , the neo-socialists marching in Berlin are organizing a popular uprising , but the Trump power base is more firm . The same frustrated American that lost their manufacturing job and pension to NAFTA , they are the neighbor of that redneck veteran Obama sent to lose in Afghanistan . The shining hope I speak of is in the pragmatic realism of Trump , Putin , and any leader compelled to actually serve a people . Here is how I see it playing out .
As I looked at Vladimir Putin 's Instagram account today , I could not help but notice they and former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi walking side-by-side in the woods . The reason I mention this is because the media in the west has already jumped on a fear , and a meme , in comparing Berlusconi to Trump . One of Mr. Putin 's friends , Berlusconi is a fascinating and powerful ally in Italy , a nation increasingly reticent on Germany 's and America 's control of Europe . The neo-fascist liberals who were so “ all in ” to get Clinton elected , now they are in chaotic disarray now over politicians like Matteo Renzi , whom Berlusconi backs . To cut short here , the Trump-Putin cohesion the far-left tried to use against the billionaire property mogul , is the same bright potential that can rescue the planet . Europe is only an extension of Washington , London , Berlin , and Paris these days , and the EU that never was has scores of nations restless for change . Trump is the catalyst for this change whether they choose to try Hillary Clinton or not . You see Trump is a business person first , and philosopher poet last . The bottom line here is , peace with Russia and carry on business , or stand trial for betraying a billion people . These protests , the NATO and EU “ warnings ” to Trump , these indications tell me just how corrupt this system was .

WASHINGTON ( Thomson Reuters Foundation ) - China should publicly disclose what it pays African governments for extracting oil , gas and minerals as a way to level the playing field for companies worldwide and help countries get a fair deal for their natural resource wealth , billionaire investor George Soros said on Monday .
“ China has to line up to join the regulations . Otherwise they are spoilers , ” Soros said at a forum on natural resources held on the sidelines of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit that runs through Wednesday .
Sub-Saharan Africa has immense riches in gold , gems and rare minerals and new discoveries of oil and gas off east Africa promise to make it a leading exporter of hydrocarbons by 2030 . Yet its citizens see only a fraction of that wealth on a continent that has among the highest levels of poverty in the world .
The value of natural resources extracted each year in Africa is estimated at $ 500 billion but revenues collected by their governments are scarcely one-tenth of that , according to Daniel Kaufmann , president of the Natural Resource Governance Institute . In addition , $ 50 billion a year leaves Africa in illicit finance through mispriced trade and corruption , said Mojanki Gumbi , a trustee of the Thabo Mbeki Foundation , which focuses on the political and economic development of Africa .
To increase accountability for natural resources , the United States and the European Union have passed laws requiring extractive industries listed on public exchanges to disclose their payments to governments .
In addition , 35 countries including many in Africa are party to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) , a coalition of governments , companies and civil society that works to improve accountability for management of revenues from natural resources by setting global standards for payment disclosure .
Soros called on Africans to urge China to participate in the initiative , and to expand payment disclosure from oil , gas and mining to include forestry and agriculture .
“ It is a very important thing to get them to join , in fact so important that we have to be ready to reconsider the structure of EITI , or China wo n't consider it , ” they said .
Multi-national companies frequently complain that their competitive position in bidding for contracts is undermined if they have to adhere to U.S. and European disclosure rules that would not apply to state-owned companies in China , which are big players in Africa .
Mo Ibrahim , a philanthropist from Sudan who made their fortune in mobile telecommunications , was cautious about whether the proposal would succeed . China does not like to engage with civil society , which is a central part of EITI , they said . However , Chinese companies are learning that failure to engage poses significant risks to their investments in Africa .
“ It is the new kid on the block in Africa , and they are finding their feet . They are getting their workers kidnapped and they are learning that it is not just some nice forest you can come in and cut down , or you can go in and pick up some good iron ore , ” Ibrahim said .
Moreover , Chinese companies already must disclose their payments to governments that are party to the EITI , and those that list securities in the EU and the United States will have to comply with new transparency rules that start taking effect next year .

A flight full of British holidaymakers was delayed for four hours when a Portuguese crew member was arrested for being DRUNK - after reportedly drinking the night away after their nation 's Euro 2016 win .
More than 140 passengers were crushed when the captain announced to the departure lounge that the senior male staff member had turned up `` drunk on duty '' .
The Small Planet Airlines flight from Gatwick to Corfu was due to leave at 9.10am on Monday but did n't take off until 1.23pm .
The captain apologised to passengers over the tannoy before shocked onlookers watched as the Portuguese national was taken away by police .
An insider said the crew member turned up late and `` well over the limit '' after just a few hours sleep following Portugal 's 1-0 Euro 2016 win over France - and even posted about it on Facebook .
The red-faced air host was understood to have been out drinking with a colleague due to work on the 5.20pm Gatwick flight to Tirana , which was also delayed .
A 45-year-old man from London was arrested and bailed , police confirmed .
An airport source said : `` The cabin crew turned up to do the security check .
`` The flight deck suspected that they were drunk for duty .

`` He had been out with another senior cabin crew member who was due to operate later .
`` He did n't get to bed until the early hours of the morning . They only had a few hours sleep . They were well and truly over the limit .
`` The captain made an announcement to the passengers to say that the delay was due to a senior cabin crew member turning up drunk on duty .
`` The crew member is Portuguese and had gone out to watch the football last night . When they made the announcement everyone was like 'oh my god ' .
`` There was in excess of 140 passengers waiting at gate two . Their reaction was complete dismay . Children were screaming because they were upset .
`` The flight deck had to call police . The police arrived and everyone saw it .
`` They arrested them under the aviation act . ''

The flight to Corfu was supposed to leave at 9.10am from gate two but the tipsy crew member did n't turn up until 10.40am .
They were then arrested and the flight taxied at 1.07pm , and took off at 1.23pm .
A second flight by the same airline to Tirana scheduled to leave at 5.20pm on Monday but was delayed until nearly 8pm , according to the Gatwick airport website .
A spokesperson for Sussex Police said a 45-year-old man had been arrested and bailed .
They said : `` At 9.05am on Monday ( 11 July ) police at Gatwick Airport were made aware that an airline crew member had failed to report for duty and there were concerns for their welfare .
`` His absence meant that the airline 's scheduled 9.10am flight to Corfu was unable to take off .

`` The 45-year-old man , from London , eventually arrived at 10.40am .
`` Due to the fact that they smelled strongly of alcohol , they were not permitted to board the aircraft and was arrested on suspicion of acting as a member of the crew of an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol .
`` He was bailed to return on September 8 . ''
Small Planet Airlines confirmed a crew member was `` removed from their duties due to suspected intoxication '' .
A spokesperson said : `` Small Planet Airlines sincerely apologises to passengers regarding the delay of the return flights London Gatwick to Corfu and Gatwick to Tirana due to the need to invite another cabin crew member to cover the missing one and perform duties .
`` Small Planet Airlines apply zero tolerance policy on alcohol consumption during the duty and 8 hours before the duty .

`` We apply even stricter rule on alcohol consumption by staff members than recommended by the European Aviation Safety Agency .
`` Coming for duty being intoxicated is a gross misconduct and leads to a dismissal of a staff member .
`` Flights from London Gatwick to Corfu departed on 12:00 local time after the delay of 3 hours and 50 minutes . ''
The spokesperson said delay time was calculated from 9.10am , until the plane `` starts moving '' meaning it recorded a delay of three hours and 20 minutes .
According to the website , Small Planet Airlines started operations in 2009 and `` since then became one of the fastest growing independent leisure airlines in Europe '' .
The financial world is buzzing with the new alternative lenders that are transforming the world of finance . But as an accountant who works with companies that have financing issues , this so-called `` fintech '' boom worries me .
Financial technology ( fintech ) is a rapidly expanding industry . And profitable – experiencing exponential growth in investment from $ 3-billion in 2013 to $ 6.8-billion in 2014 . It is comprised of companies that use technology to make financial systems more efficient . Fintech embodies a new set of innovated products that are tailored to the unique needs of small businesses . These include marketplace ( peer-to-peer ) lending , merchant and e-commerce , invoicing , online supply-chain finance and online trade .
The fintech industry caters to businesses that provide supply-chain financing as well as alternative-financing models to small businesses and consumers . The alternative lending space has grown rapidly in Canada thanks in part to the success seen in the United States and in London . Companies are now aiming to offer financing arrangements at competitive rates to small businesses and consumers . Some even offer financing to consumers that will allow them to pay off credit cards .

A majority of players within the fintech sector thrive due to the ease and quick accessibility of these loans . Unlike banks , where rigorous and diligent credit checks take days or weeks to approve loans , these start-up ventures shorten their turnaround time by merging technology , social media , statistics and complex algorithms to expedite the loan-approval process . Some of these start-up ventures approve loans within minutes , with funds showing up in your bank account by the end of the day . But these different approaches to check credit worthiness are problematic . Loans may be offered to small businesses or consumers who are not well suited for this type of financing due to their inadequate credit history .
There are risks on a micro and macro level , too . Potential funding to unfit borrowers combined with the systemic risk of a partially unregulated sector could have a negative impact on the financial markets in the future .
During The Future of Lending Now event held at the Mars Centre last month , Kevin Sandhu , CEO of Grow Financial ( previously Grouplend ) stressed that federal regulation has not caught up to the innovative practices within the fintech sector .
These smaller loans may be unsecured , meaning that only the borrowers ' creditworthiness supports the loan rather than hard collateral . This opens the floodgates to increased risk of fraud and more personal and business bankruptcies .
While StatsCan reports that business bankruptcies have fallen 0.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter the previous year , that could change . With the increasing amount of alternative financing available , this number could be higher in the future .
Alternative financing is n't new : In the 2008 U.S. credit crisis , the majority of bad debt stemmed from mortgage dealers who issued loans to individuals who were not financially capable of obtaining a regular loan . Although mortgages differ from small-business loans , the worrisome premise remains the same – unqualified individuals and small businesses may be receiving funds that they would not otherwise be qualified to receive .
Alternative financing may offer fast money to consumers and small-business owners , but it 's consumers , suppliers and employees who suffer when a business fails .

LGBT rights in the European Union are protected under the European Union 's ( EU ) treaties and law . Same-sex sexual activity is legal in all EU states and discrimination in employment has been banned since 2000 . However EU states have different laws when it comes to any greater protection , same-sex civil union , same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples .
Treaty protections [ edit ]
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes in Articles 10 and 19 provisions for combating discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation . These provisions were enacted by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Furthermore , Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights asserts that `` any discrimination based on any ground such as [ ... ] sexual orientation shall be prohibited . '' The Charter was agreed in 2000 and became legally binding in 2009 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
Legislative protection [ edit ]
LGBT rights in the European Union
Following the inclusion of the Treaty of Amsterdam 's abovementioned provisions , the directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation was enacted in 2000 . This framework directive compelled all EU states to adopt , within three years , anti-discrimination legislation in employment . That legislation had to include provisions to protect people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation . [ 2 ]
In practice , this protects EU citizens from being refused a job , or from being fired , because of their sexual orientation . It also protects them from being harassed by a colleague due to their sexual orientation . It does not cover being refused medical services or treatment , refusal of being given a double room in a hotel , protection from bullying in a school and refusal of social security schemes ( e.g . survivors ' pensions and financial assistance to carers ) . Protection under EU law in these circumstances is however granted on the grounds of race or gender . [ 4 ]
Proposed directive [ edit ]
A proposed European anti-discrimination law would outlaw discrimination in the areas of social protection , social advantages , education and access to supply of goods , on the basis of religious belief , disability , age , and sexual orientation . [ 5 ] However the directive has been stalled in the Council , despite strong support from the European Parliament . [ 6 ]
Transgender rights [ edit ]
EU law currently takes a different approach to transgender issues . Despite the European Parliament adopting a resolution on transgender ' rights as early as 1989 , transgender identity is not incorporated into any EU funding and was not mentioned in the law establishing the European Institute for Gender Equality ( EIGE ) as sexual orientation was . However , the case law of the European Court of Justice provides some protection by interpreting discrimination on the basis of 'sex ' to also refer to people who have had 'gender reassignment ' . Thus all EU sex discrimination law applies to transgender people . [ 2 ] In 2002 , the 1976 equal treatment directive was revised to include discrimination based on gender identity , to reflect case law on the directive . [ 7 ]
Other actions [ edit ]
Between 2001 and 2006 , a Community Action Programme to Combat Discrimination involved the expenditure of €100 million to fight discrimination in a number of areas , including sexual orientation . [ 7 ]
In 2009 the European Commission has acted to tone down a law in Lithuania that included homophobic language and also aimed to support the gay pride parade in the country and others under threat of banning . [ 2 ]
Foreign relations [ edit ]
In June 2010 , the Council of the European Union adopted a non-binding toolkit to promote LGBT people 's human rights . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
In June 2013 , the Council upgraded it to binding LGBTI Guidelines instructing EU diplomats around the world to defend the human rights of LGBTI people . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
Same-sex unions [ edit ]
Same-sex marriage has been legalised in Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Ireland , Luxembourg , Malta , the Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , Sweden and the United Kingdom . Same-sex civil unions have been legalised in Austria , Belgium , Croatia , Cyprus , Czechia , Estonia , Finland , France , Greece , Hungary , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Slovenia and the United Kingdom . In Denmark and Sweden civil unions were legal from 1989 and 1995 to 2012 and 2009 , respectively . In Germany , registered life partnerships were legal between 2001 and 2017 . However existing civil unions/registered life partnerships are still recognised in all of these countries .
Bulgaria , Croatia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland and Slovakia have constitutionally defined marriage as being between a man and a woman .
European Union law ( the Citizens ' Rights Directive 2004/38/EC ) requires those member states that legalised same-sex partnerships to recognise each other 's partnerships for the purpose of freedom of movement . [ 12 ] The European Parliament has however approved a report calling for mutual recognition . [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
According to European Court of Justice case law based on the Employment Equality Framework Directive , employees in a civil partnership with a same-sex partner must be granted the same benefits as those granted to their colleagues upon their marriage , where marriage is not possible for same-sex couples . The Court established this principle in 2008 in the case of Tadao Maruko v. Versorgungsanstalt der deutschen Bühnen with regards to a German registered life partnership . In December 2013 , the Court confirmed this in the case of Frédéric Hay v. Crédit agricole mutuel ( C-267/12 ) with regards to a French civil solidarity pact , which is significantly inferior to marriage than a German registered life partnership . [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
Also , according to the European Court of Justice in the case of Coman and Others , by judgement of 5 June 2018 , a `` spouse '' ( or partner or any other family member ) in the Free Movement Directive ( 2004/38/EC ) includes a ( foreign ) same-sex spouse ; member states are required to confer the right of residence on the ( foreign ) same-sex spouse of a citizen of the European Union . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
Member State laws on sexual orientation [ edit ]
Openly gay people are allowed to serve in the military of every country except Cyprus [ citation needed ] , however this is contrary to European law and is rarely enforced .
Since December 2016 , Malta became the first and only country in the EU - as well as in Europe - to ban conversion therapy . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]
Due to the Cyprus dispute placing Northern Cyprus outside the Republic of Cyprus ' control , EU law is suspended in the area governed by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .

Public opinion [ edit ]
Below is the share of respondents per country who agreed with the following statements in the 2015 Special Eurobarometer on discrimination .

Londoners trying to keep their wits as so much beer goes to waste .
The London Beer Flood took place in the parish of Saint Giles , London when an immense vat belonging to the Meux and Company Brewery erupted . The vat contained almost 8,000 drums of beer and upon rupture released a 15-foot high wave . The enormous wave rushed down the streets , destroying buildings and inebriating all in its path .
The mess took over two hours for Londoners to clean up because they did not have an adequate amount of drinkware to scoop up the dregs and consume the mess . This led to the great 1815 reform of the London fire service which still exists today , where each firefighter 's tool belt now includes a frosted beer stein for such situations . The courts ruled it an Act of God and absolved Meux and Company of any wrongdoing .
Cause [ edit ]
The English Department of Health and Booze Consumption has very detailed records of the incident . According to their archives , `` Meux Brewery stored several large drums filled to the brim with frothy beer . The worst-case beernario occurred on October 17 , 1814 , when one of the large drums containing 610,000 gallons of beer ejaculated their contents . This plethora of beer began a chain of orgasms . The massive spurts caused severe damage to the other drums , with each drum , eventually overwhelming the brewery walls when a final climax of beer smashed them down . There was much beery emission . ''
Aftermath [ edit ]
The flood nears its end and liver failure begins .
1.4 million gallons of English beer rushed through the streets , understandably causing panic that the beer would go to waste . Many swam outside trying to carry glasses , kettles , and pots for storing the beer . Others opened their mouths and lapped the beer up as it swept them downstream . Neighbors eventually called the army , who upon their arrival found floating bodies and decided it was time to end the party and clean up .
Meux Brewery came out of it better than the victims and the rest of St. Giles . The Brewery was taken to court but the judge and jury decided that it was God 's mysterious work . Therefore no one was to blame , except God . However , God did n't show up for their court date and authorities are still looking for him .
To keep from going bankrupt , Meux petitioned Parliament for reimbursement of the beer that was drank . Parliament rejected this request and instead passed an act which allowed the company to brew twice the volume of beer the following year .
Years after clean up , the neighborhood is still sticky and stinks of stale beer . Though they tried to mask the smell by demolishing the brewery in 1922 , and building the Dominion Theatre , you can still walk through St. Giles and get a drunken buzz by simply breathing .
Fatalities [ edit ]
During a beer chugging contest , a man reached down to refill their glass and unknowingly scooped up a used condom . The condom inflated in their esophagus and caused them to die of herpes .
In attempts to clean up , a man began drinking the spate right off the streets hoping they could save the slums of St. Giles . They soon passed out and died a few days later from alcohol poisoning .
Eight people died in total , most being women and children because the lazy fucks did n't have jobs . This saved their husbands and father 's lives because most of the men of St. Giles were still at work during the time of the flood . Had it happened later in the day , there certainly would have been more deaths by alcohol poisoning and domestic violence .
The wounded were taken to a hospital , where their presence nearly caused a riot . Other patients could smell them , and were convinced that the nurses were serving them beer and demanded their portion .
Flawless Victories [ edit ]
An alcoholic mother died from embarking on a free piss-up , leaving their drunken three-week-old fetus to fend for herself , who soon found out they too loved the taste of beer and died from fetal alcohol poisoning . A near-by tavern , Tavistock Arms , collapsed trapping a bar whore under a wall and causing them to drown . Since they were used to choking and had little to no gag-reflex , there is a myth that they truly died because they were sucking the cock of an alcoholic man and died of alcohol poisoning after swallowing their cum .
Once the initial terror had diminished , many were curious to see what `` death by beer '' looked like . They flocked to the homes of the victims . Families began charging a toll for viewing their homes , or what was left of them , and the corpse of their dead family members . At one point , so many people crowded into a home that the floor collapsed and persons present were hurtled into the basement below that was still half-filled with beer the family was hoarding . One of them suffered a cut on their leg which led to a fatal infection , making them the London Beer Flood 's final victim .
Actor James Woods took aim at the Mall of America on Monday by posting a 45-second video showing hundreds of Muslims gathering at Nickelodeon Universe , the seven-acre indoor amusement park in the center of Bloomington mall . The conservative actor says “ I would suggest getting your Christmas shopping done early . Oh , wait ... ”
Woods , a prolific user of Twitter with more than 1 million followers , frequently tweets on conservative causes . Their Mall of America tweet had more than 12,000 likes and about 9,000 retweets Tuesday . Many of the nearly 5,000 commenters supported Woods , but it also has generated backlash .
Although it is unclear when the video was originally captured or posted online , Nickelodeon Universe is a popular destination for Minnesota families , including the state 's sizable Somali-American population , particularly during Eid al-Adha , the biggest religious holiday in the Muslim world .
Calls to the Mall of America seeking comment have not been returned .

It 's not unheard of for a restaurant to receive the odd fake order . But when LAN Restaurant in Riverside received a number of large orders only to discover it was part of a prank , the community came out to show their support for the small establishment .
Lan Phoung , owner of the restaurant , posted to Facebook how touching and overwhelming the show of support has been .
`` Old and new customers [ came ] to the restaurant to show us love and support over the past few days , I am very speechless and feeling very thankful for that , '' wrote Phoung on Facebook . `` This is the most awesome [ neighbourhood ] that I have lived in over my 15 years in Canada , there are so many many of warmhearted people . ''
It seems that LAN had become the target of a campaign to hurt the business including fake orders and negative online reviews . After word got around , both old and new patrons came out to lend a hand anyway they could .
Some contributed by monetary means while others offered moral support .
`` I am sorry and concerns me what happen to you . Who can do something so vicious ? '' one person commented .
Another suggested LAN use prepaid ordering methods in the future .
`` If these ... people ... aim to sabotage your business , '' Phuong lamented `` it does not matter whether you ask for the visa card ... they will give you the cards that do not belong to them .... later on when the bank finds out it is a default card , the bank will take back the money that you collected the other day with the stolen card . ''
I may write and talk about video games for a living , but I 'm as ignorant as one could possibly be of computer science and still be legally allowed to work on the internet . So , like many of you I 'd guess , when Microsoft said its Xbox One refresh Project Scorpio would have `` six teraflops of computing power '' my stupid Cro-Magnon brain heard it as `` very fast and good . ''
But what is a teraflop ? Well , I had an hour to kill before the E3 show floor opened , so I decided to spend it educating myself , if only for a distraction from obsessing about the fact that Insomniac is making a Spider-Man game .
My research methods included ( 1 ) Google and ( 2 ) watching this video from the Frontier Scientists Channel :
It 's worth noting that if you have somehow stumbled on this page as part of researching a term paper about flops , and you have to submit that paper to a real adult that actually understands flops , then you should probably just watch that video and move on . Mainly because it includes several insights from the man on the left and zero from the gentleman on the right .
So lets take the second part of the word first , what 's a flop ? Well , that 's an acronym for `` floating point operations per second . '' Now , I know what you 're thinking : Would n't `` flopops '' or `` flopos '' have been a more fun acronym ? The answer is an unqualified `` Yes . ''
But , umm , what 's a floating point operation ? Well , a floating point is a number with a decimal point in it and , as you remember from middle school , they 're harder to work with than integers ( no decimal ) . So the number of those a computer can do per second is a way computer scientists can measure computing power . In terms of graphics processing , those computations are used to draw polygons and move them around on screen . More flops mean you can get more of those polygons all over the place . So , that 's a flop .
A megaflop is a million of those . A gigaflop is a billion . A teraflop is a trillion . Project Scorpio has six of those . The fastest video card , the Nvidia GTX 1080 , does 8.9 teraflops , just for comparison .
Here 's how six teraflops stacks up to the console competition :
So , what have we learned ? At the risk of being reductionist , flops are a measure of `` good '' and teraflops are very big units of goodness and six teraflops are six very fast things stacked on top of each other . So , in closing , when Microsoft says Project Scorpio has `` six teraflops of computing power , '' you should hear `` very fast and good . ''
... Well , that 's an hour of my life I 'm not getting back .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co plans to trim its thermal coal investments amid growing pressure worldwide for companies to cut reliance on the fossil fuel after last year 's landmark climate pact in Paris , its president said on Wednesday .

Mitsui owns mine stakes that had an equivalent annual output of about 13.5 million tonnes in the year ended March 31 , and it expects that figure to drop to 9 million tonnes in three years .
“ Considering the result of the global climate summit , we basically plan to reduce thermal coal assets , ” Mitsui President and Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Tatsuo Yasunaga told an analyst meeting on Wednesday .
Global leaders clinched a climate-protection deal in Paris in December to transform the world 's fossil-fuel driven economy , and calls have grown since for the global power sector and other industries to reduce coal use .
Under the pact , Japan , the world 's No.5 emitter of carbon dioxide , has agreed to cut greenhouse emissions by 26 percent from 2013 levels by 2030 , but it has come under pressure for not doing more to reduce its dependence on coal .
“ We will consider reducing thermal coal output or selling stakes in thermal coal mines , ” Yasunaga said , although adding that Mitsui will continue to invest in coking coal assets .
The Tokyo-based company agreed in 2014 to buy stakes in Vale 's Moatize coking coal mine and port project in Mozambique for $ 763 million , and is now planning to close the deal by March 2017 , according to Yasunaga .
“ We are working on a finance deal with Vale and we expect to close the deal soon , ” they said .
As for a final investment decision ( FID ) on a liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) project off the coast of Mozambique , Yasunaga said negotiations with the local government are in final stages . They did not project an exact timing of FID , but said they expect “ an advancement ” in the process by next March .
Thanks to falling construction and development costs , the Mozambique LNG project is becoming competitive even with the current low oil prices , they said .
Mitsui on Tuesday posted its first annual loss since being established in 1947 , booking massive writedowns for the year ended March 31 after iron ore , copper and oil prices plunged .
The company plans to step upselling assets , include some metal holdings , Yasunaga said without further elaboration .
Mitsui plans to continue to invest in other resource assets , however , with a focus on areas where it has some strength such as in iron ore and natural gas , Yasunaga said .

Settlement groups are bracing for a rush of asylum claimants crossing by foot into B.C . as protections lapse for citizens of countries in crisis who sought refuge in the U.S .
People with temporary protected status in the U.S. are those considered unable to safely return home to countries torn by war or hit by a major natural disaster . They ca n't be deported or detained by the Department of Homeland Security .
The U.S. federal government is now considering whether to extend the protected status for residents of countries whose designations are set to expire next year . Based on President Donald Trump 's administration 's decision in May to grant Haiti a shorter-than-average , six-month extension , immigration experts are guessing these designations will lapse .
Earlier this month , Global News reported that it had obtained an intelligence analysis sheet showing that the Canada Border Services Agency considers extensions unlikely for Haiti , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Honduras and Syria , whose designations expire between January and March .
The CBSA identified the Pacific region as one of three places , along with Quebec and southern Ontario , where ports of entry are expected to have “ significant increases in claims in the month leading up to and directly after each expiration date , ” Global said .
Groups that work with refugees in B.C . say there are already signs the province is attracting some of the 195,000 Salvadorans and 60,000 Hondurans in the U.S. who may soon lose their status .
El Salvador was given protected status designation in 2001 , following a series of earthquakes , and Honduras in 1999 , following Hurricane Mitch .
“ We 've had a number of clients from Honduras and El Salvador , ” said Julia St. Pierre , special projects coordinator for the Inland Refugee Society . “ I do n't know about the other countries , but not as many . ”
St. Pierre said the society has seen a “ huge upsurge ” over the past six months of Latin Americans crossing into B.C. , mostly by foot .
They 've lived in the U.S. for five or more years but did n't have citizenship , and told the society that they fear deportation under the current administration .
Through word of mouth and media reports , people hear that moving to Canada is simple , St. Pierre said . They do their research but when they arrive , they learn these claims are false . They struggle to get government ID , work permits or open a bank account .
“ People think it is going to be a lot easier , that they 'll get housing , they 'll get support , that they will be welcomed when they come , ” they said . “ They have no idea that there 's really no support for them . ”
Harsha Walia of No One Is Illegal said that until a few weeks ago , their group would get one or two inquiries each week from Salvadorans and Hondurans with temporary protected status who were considering crossing into B.C . Now , four people call each week .
Walia said most of the Salvadorans and Hondurans who speak with their organization have family in B.C . This exempts them from the Canada-U . S. Safe Third Country Agreement , which requires refugee claimants to request protection in the first of the two countries they arrive in .
But for others , the agreement is an incentive to crossing the border irregularly because it only affects those who arrive at regular ports of entry and seek asylum , Walia added .
Walia believes Canada is woefully unprepared for any increase in asylum seekers , particularly after thousands crossed into Quebec over the summer and wound up being held in Montreal 's Olympic Stadium and in military tents .
“ The federal government talks about welcoming refugees but I think has deliberately created a situation where it creates resentment by not adequately supporting people , ” they said .
“ Trudeau tweets about it . … That does n't change the material realities for people . ”
With a large proportion of U.S. sanctuary cities concentrated on the west coast , B.C . 's appeal for illicit border crossing may be diminished , Walia said .
“ There 's no full sanctuary city in Canada that offers the protections of a genuine sanctuary city , which particularly involves no police collaboration with ( border officials ) , ” they said .
CBSA and federal department of Immigration , Refugees and Citizenship offices processed 1,150 asylum claimants in B.C . in the first seven months of 2017 , after processing 1,365 in all of 2016 . In those seven months , 10,865 were processed in Ontario and 7,950 in Quebec .
The B.C . RCMP referred Postmedia 's questions about crossings related to lapsing protected status to the CBSA . The CBSA did not provide an official for comment nor did it answer emailed questions asking specifically how the expiration of protected designations will affect Pacific crossings and its work in B.C .
It instead provided a statement : “ The CBSA will not speculate , however , we can tell you that CBSA 's operational response includes close collaboration with other government departments and will draw on their resources as required . The CBSA is continuing to adjust its operational posture . ”
Jorge Barón , executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in Seattle , said people in the region are nervous about losing their temporary protected status , particularly after the Trump administration announced it was ending protections from deportations for people brought illegally to the United States as small children .
Barón said their clients have n't mentioned wanting to move to B.C. , but “ it does n't mean that people may not be thinking about it . ”
When Haiti 's protected status was only granted a six-month extension , it sent a signal to Salvadorans and Hondurans that they need to prepare for the worst , they said .
“ All of a sudden , now they 're facing this prospect of the fact that ( protected status ) is going to end and they 're going to be required to leave . ”
Many have deep ties to the U.S. , which has been their home for nearly two decades , Barón said . Most are looking at legal options to stay in the U.S. , rather than making plans to relocate . Those married to a U.S. citizen have the best chance .
Vancouver immigration and refugee lawyer Zool Suleman said they have n't had a remarkable increase of calls related to lapsing U.S. protected status , but the issue has prompted chatter in their sector .
“ What I have seen is some tentative traffic in social media and on our website where people are starting to plan out their futures , ” they said .
“ The kind of safety they felt in the United States , it 's quickly evaporating , and there are educated , young people from these affected countries who do n't see a future for themselves back in their home countries or the countries of their citizenship , and are now actively exploring Canada . ”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) issued a regulation on Thursday to stop referring to midget raisins as `` midget '' after an activist group called the term offensive .
The USDA 's Agricultural Marketing Service ( AMS ) issued the proposed rule , announcing the U.S. `` Standards for Grades of Processed Raisins '' would eliminate all five times the word midget is used . Midget has long been used to describe the differences in sizes of California raisins .
`` The action would clarify AMS grade standards by eliminating the use of the term ‘ midget , ' while consistently using the term ‘ small ' for raisins graded in that category , '' the USDA said in the proposed rule . `` The industry has used the two grade terms interchangeably for years . The proposed grade standards would be applied uniformly by all handlers . ''
`` These changes would modernize and clarify the standards by removing dual terminology for the same requirement , '' the agency said .
The government said the change was prompted by a request from the Little People of America , a nonprofit membership organization for people of short stature .
The group wants to eliminate the word `` midget '' from society , and zeroed in on the raisin classification , although they said it was a benign use of the term .
`` On May 13 , 2013 , AMS received a petition from the Little People of America stating that they ‘ are trying to raise awareness around and eliminate the use of the word midget , ' '' the USDA said . `` The petition further stated that , ‘ Though the use of the word midget by the USDA when classifying certain food products is benign , Little People of America , and the dwarfism community , hopes that the USDA would consider phasing out the term midget . ' ''
Little People of America has previously chastised the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals , Marvin Lewis , for calling the Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel a `` midget . ''
The proposed rule changes standards adopted in 1978 that stated small or midget size raisins `` means that 95 percent , by weight , of all the raisins will pass through round perforations 24/64-inch in diameter , and not less than 70 percent , by weight , of all raisins will pass through round perforations 22/64-inch in diameter . ''
The rule said that the Raisin Administrative Committee ( RAC ) , a branch of the USDA , `` approved the removal of the term midget from the standards '' last year .
Removing the word midget is the first regulatory action taken by the USDA regarding raisins since the Supreme Court sided against them in June , ruling that they can no longer seize raisins from producers to make prices go up , striking down a New Deal-era program in the process .

Yesterday , Imperial tobacco announced it would be shutting its factories in England and France . The maker of French tobacco favourites such as Gauloises and Gitanes will be moving production to Spain .
Declining sales and a hostile regulatory environment have been the dominant story of the tobacco world for the past decade .
However , there may still be an alternative future for the industry . Here are three reasons why those in the tobacco industry may not be looking to throw in the towel in just yet .
Ecigarettes
Ecigarettes have been revolutionising the world of tobacco , translating smokers to vapers with extraordinary success . Some have even claimed the new devices represent a `` Kodak moment '' for regular cigarettes . American lender Wells Fargo has even gone so far as to predict that ecigarettes could outsell conventional cigarettes within a decade .
Japanese banking giant Nomura believes ecigarettes are set to rise to 15 per cent of equivalent units in the US by 2023 . The rise of the ecigarette has the potential to spell disaster for the tobacco industry . However , this could all be about to change , as a host of national and supranational regulators seek to exert control over the development , strength and marketing of ecigarettes .
Parts of the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) have suggested plans to regulate the electronic devices as stringently as conventional tobacco , according to leaked documents seen by the Financial Times ( FT ) .
The WHO ( do ) considerations follow the same line of thinking as the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , which has said it plans to regulate ecigarettes as tobacco products .
In February , the EU banned the sale of ecigarettes with a nicotine concentration of over 20mg/ml . The decision was widely criticised as a mistaken application of the precautionary principle , as modelling conducted by London Economics estimated that the ruling could prevent the saving of 105,000 European lives per year .
Tobacco control failing to cut smoking rates
Smoking rates have been on a downward path ever since the link between smoking and several fatal diseases was proved beyond a reasonable doubt .
However , the steep fall in smoking rates has slowed in many developed countries , including those with some of the most draconian tobacco control measures
Ireland has one of the strictest tobacco control regimes in Europe but the smoking rate is the third highest in Europe at 29 per cent , according to Eurobarometer .
Australia has been a pioneer in tobacco control , introducing plain packaging in 2012 . Since the measures were passed , the illicit trade in tobacco has soared by 20 per cent , with the amount of tobacco tax avoided estimated at $ 1.1bn .
Smoking usage in Australia has also remained relatively stable between July 2012 and June 2013 , according to a KPMG report .
Tobacco companies and consumers are adjusting behaviour
Instead of quitting , cigarette smokers are trading down from premium brands , in response to price rises . The market for pipe and roll your own tobacco has also rapidly expanded in recent years .
Tobacco giant Altria saw the stick volume of its cigarettes decline by four per cent based on full year 2013 results . However , the company 's discount brand L & M cigarettes rose by three per cent over the period . The tobacco industry is increasingly adopting a more value oriented model .
The number of premium cigarettes sold as a percentage of the overall volume of cigarettes sold within the United States has now fallen from just over 70 per cent to 58.6 per cent .
A Gandhi statue in the Dudu area of Jaipur was defaced on Monday , with a message on the statue threatening a blast on Republic Day .
The message scribbled on the statue also claimed support for terror group Islamic State ( IS ) .
“ The act seems to be by some miscreants but we are taking it seriously and have informed the security agencies . A probe into the incident has begun and we are investigating the objective behind it – whether it was done to create communal tension or was an act by an IS sympathiser , ” Inspector General ( Jaipur rural range ) DC Jain told HT .
The police have registered a case under Indian Penal Code Sections 124 ( a ) and 153 ( a ) at the Dudu police station . “ Prima facie , it seems that the act is by somebody residing in the locality . We have sent our team to investigate , ” Superintendent of Police ( Jaipur rural ) Rameshwar Singh said .
Earlier this week , the national investigation agency arrested Abu Anas , who hails from Tonk , on suspicion of being an IS sympathiser . Their arrest followed the capture of Mohammed Sirajuddin , posted as the marketing manager of Indian Oil Corporation Limited , Jaipur , on charges of links with IS .

Boy , 11 , and parents die after falling into volcanic crater near Naples
An 11-year-old boy and their parents have died after falling into a volcanic crater near Naples .
Italian press reports said the boy walked into a prohibited area at Solfatara di Pozzuoli , one of 40 volcanoes in the Campi Flegrei area west of Naples .
They are believed to have fainted due to gas fumes before falling into the crater . The boy 's parents tried to save him , but the crater collapsed .
Their other child , aged seven , survived because they had left the scene in search of help . The incident took place at about 11am on Tuesday .
The family , originally from Turin but living near Venice , were on a visit to the tourist site . Their bodies were recovered from the three-metre ( 10ft ) crater by firefighters .
“ Either there was a small explosion , or the ground simply gave way from their weight , and they fell into this hole , ” national fire brigade spokesperson Luca Cari said . Firefighters said they appeared to have died from asphyxia , possibly because of hot gases emanating from the ground .
The younger boy ran into a bar at the entrance of the crater , where they were comforted by staff for several hours .
Armando Guerriero , the bar 's owner , said : “ He saw their parents and brother falling into the crater .
“ He did n't know whether they were alive or dead . They were crying and calling their mother 's name . In the 40 years that I 've worked here , I 've never seen anything like it . ”
The dormant Solfatara , which last erupted in 1198 , has a shallow crater and emits steam with sulphurous fumes . It is located in the Campi Flegrei , a sprawling constellation of ancient volcanic craters scorching hot just below the surface .
The volcano is managed by a private company and open all year round to visitors , who can go on a guided tour or explore it by themselves .
President Trump has nominated a slate of solid picks for the federal bench , including a new list of nominees this week . Among them is Kurt D. Engelhardt .
Trump nominated Engelhardt to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals , a district that covers the area from Alabama to the Rio Grande . Engelhardt already serves as a United States District Court judge in New Orleans .
Engelhardt will be familiar to PJ Media readers .
They are the judge who wrote a scathing 129-page order blistering the misconduct of lawyers at the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division and the local New Orleans U.S. Attorney 's Office in a prosecution of New Orleans police officers . Their order offers a look behind the curtain of some of the worst ideological misconduct that occurred at the Obama DOJ .
Misconduct may be an inadequate word to describe the behavior of DOJ lawyers , and Engelhardt saw it all up close . See PJ Media 's `` Justice Dept . Lawyer Karla Dobinski 's Misconduct Sends Cops to Prison , '' or Hans von Spakovsky writing at National Review : `` Grotesque DOJ Misconduct '' .
Here 's von Spakovsky on the Holder DOJ 's skullduggery and Engelhardt 's opinion :
Trying to figure out what the prosecutors had done sent the court “ on a legal odyssey unlike any other. ” But that legal odyssey led the judge on September 17 to grant a new trial to the New Orleans police officers . It is the first time , according to Judge Engelhardt , that federal “ prosecutors acting with anonymity used social media to circumvent ethical obligations , professional responsibilities , and even to commit violations of the Code of Federal Regulations. ” The 129-page order , which details the misbehavior of the Louisiana DOJ lawyers and the Civil Rights Division 's Dobinski , is appalling reading . And it is n't just that Dobinski was a high-level Justice Department lawyer who was posting anonymous blogs about the trial . They also encouraged other anonymous bloggers , who “ repeatedly posted vigorous pro-prosecution statements strongly condemning the defendants , their witnesses , and their entire defense . ”
If you want to see the corrupt depths that ideological lawyers in the Holder Justice Department would plumb to convict cops , read Engelhardt 's entire order .
It is a tale of deliberate and deceptive violation of the constitutional rights of police officers in order to get a conviction at any price , and of lying to the court . It is a cautionary tale of civil rights enforcement run amok from ideologically driven hatred of police -- an issue that even this week continues to resonate in America .
As I wrote at PJ Media , one of the lawyers , Barbara `` Bobbi '' Bernstein , was criticized by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for misleading Englehardt . Did their behavior hurt them career ?
Quite the contrary :
PoliZette Clinton 's Media Cabal : Trump is Russian Apparatchik Desperation fuels attempts to revive Hillary 's poll numbers
KKK hoods did n't work .

Hillary Clinton 's claim that ISIS is for Donald Trump , and will be happy if they win — that did n't work , either .
“ What you see is … [ Hillary Clinton ] having to dumb themselves down to deal with this — idiot — on the other side , ” said Mika Brzezinski of “ Morning Joe . ”
Now Clinton supporters , including the usual media suspects , are suggesting Trump is a Kremlin apparatchik , easily used by Russian buddies .
It all started when Trump spoke to former CNN host Larry King , whose broadcast is picked up by Russia Today ( RT ) .
And when MSNBC showed a clip of Gov . Mike Pence , Trump 's running mate , saying Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama , and that would change with a Trump-Pence administration , the meltdown on MSNBC 's “ Morning Joe ” began Friday .
“ I 'd like to know what Donald Trump thinks about Adolf Hitler , ” asked “ Morning Joe ” panelist Donny Deutsch . “ I think [ Trump ] wants to be a dictator . ”

And a Russian puppet , to boot .
[ lz_jwplayer video= “ eJkkAT3L ” ads= ” true ” ]
Chuck Todd , NBC political analyst , said Trump was used by Vladimir Putin 's propaganda network . “ It 's surreal , ” said Todd .
But the posing was a bit awkward . One “ Morning Joe ” panelist admitted they criticized Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 when Romney said at a presidential debate that Russia was America 's primary geopolitical foe . Romney was mocked by Obama , among others , for the statement .
“ I 've apologized for that , ” the panelist said , and added the Republican Party was wrong to go from Romney 's position to a friendlier status with Russia .
It was n't just MSNBC that seemed angry Trump praised Putin over Obama . CNN seemed appalled Trump even spoke to King .

Since CNN booted King off the air , King has been working indirectly for RT . King 's show is produced by Ora TV . RT picks up the productions to air . RT also does extensive broadcasting in the United States .
Related : Was Hillary Wearing an Earpiece at Vets Forum ?
Trump 's campaign said King , a longtime friend , asked for an interview and Trump gave one . Trump later said they did n't know it would wind up on RT .
On CNN Friday , Trump 's campaign manager , Kellyanne Conway , defended Trump 's media appearance and remarks to CNN 's Chris Cuomo . “ If you think that Donald Trump is the only person in this country that thinks we 've had a feckless , anemic foreign policy in the last eight years , then that 's just not true , ” Conway told Cuomo . Advertisement But none of this matters to Trump 's critics . After their performance at the “ Commander-in-Chief Forum , ” Beltway pundits are still furious that Trump insulted Obama and said Obama 's generals were inept . Related : Desperate Hillary Claims ISIS for Trump Philip Bump of The Washington Post 's “ The Fix ” wrote , “ It 's weirdly fitting that a Donald Trump interview aired on RT. ” But “ Morning Joe ” is where the Clinton surrogates got in the harshest lashes . “ What you see is … [ Hillary Clinton ] having to dumb themselves down to deal with this — idiot —on the other side , ” said “ Morning Joe ” co-host Mika Brzezinski . Fair warning , America — if you fail MSNBC 's expectations , they will be very , very disappointed .
“ This election is going to be an I.Q . test for America , ” Deutsch told “ Morning Joe . ”

It 's best to take the anti-Putin bluster and tough talk from MSNBC with a grain of salt . When MSNBC cancelled Ed Schultz 's show , the man who once mocked Putin went over to RT — where they remain today .
And not once did the MSNBC talking heads mention Hillary Clinton 's failed attempt to “ reset ” relations with Russia . Maybe they 're just worried Trump will get the reset right .
Privileged Party Girl Malia Obama FREAKS OUT & Accosts White House Correspondent Lucian Wintrich at Exclusive NY Lounge
President Obama 's oldest daughter ca n't control their privileged temper like daddy taught them to .
Saturday , March 25 , 2017 , found Malia Obama , the 44th President 's oldest daughter , at the Parlor , an exclusive Soho club , for a 21-and-over event .
Martina Markota was with Lucian Wintrich and was the first to make note of Malia Obama being there :
https : //twitter.com/MartinaMarkota/status/845868099928838144
The minor had been rubbing shoulders with other guests all night until they spotted the Gateway Pundit 's own White House correspondent Lucian Wintrich . They were quick to confront him :
Again , Malia Obama is at the party my friend is hosting in SoHo ; they just literally started yelling at me lol — Lucian B. Wintrich ( @ lucianwintrich ) March 26 , 2017
Multiple witnesses watched as Malia Obama , Obama 's oldest daughter , ran up to Wintrich with the intent of stirring up controversy . Wintrich believes at the point of altercation they were intoxicated , which should bring everyone back to those other moments of infamy when Barack 's daughter decided to “ act out ” .
Wintrich attempted to snap a picture of Malia before they ran up to them furious . They asked Wintrich to confirm who they were before accosting them and saying : “ If you wan na have a conversation , let 's sit down , let 's have a real conversation . ”
Again , for the record , 18 year old Malia Obama literally scolded me for being in the same ( 21+ ) lounge in NYC as their 🕵🏻 # BadParenting — Lucian B. Wintrich ( @ lucianwintrich ) March 26 , 2017
Wintrich responded in kind by welcoming the invitation : “ Absolutely . Let 's sit down and have a conversation . ”
This positive response from Wintrich sent Malia into a tailspin with the former President 's daughter saying , “ I think you 're disgusting . ”
They were quickly escorted away by their personal security . Wintrich was able to capture this photo of Malia 's elbow :
Wintrich and company claim that Malia shouted both at them and others as they seemed to be visibly unhinged . Wintrich currently is in New York while reorganizing their belongings for their current work in Washington D.C. and the Briefing Room . They were hoping for a calm and civil night out when the incident took place . Luckily for Malia , their security was there to keep them from being even more reckless .
When asked for comment during the ordeal , Wintrich on the phone said , “ It 's hilarious that an 18 year old would have the “ audacity of confrontation ” [ Wintrich was refrencing their father 's book `` The Audacity of Hope ” , they felt the need to clarify the referential joke , as they often do ] at a 21+ lounge in NYC that my friends invited me to… ”
Privilege and entitlement grants you the opportunity to be at a club for 21-and-over individuals as well as the opportunity to make a fool of yourself in public . Although the Democrats and the left at large love to say Obama never had any scandals , the fantasy world that the Obama family lives within is quickly dissipating and everyday the White House they ran grows more embarrassing .
SO management of Parlor in NYC told me to delete the Malia Obama shoulder pic from all my of social media or I 'd be banned ; GUESS I 'M BANNED pic.twitter.com/ns8T2oZP87 — Lucian B. Wintrich ( @ lucianwintrich ) March 26 , 2017

Objectively , the fact that the new Miss USA is a black woman , a nuclear scientist , and an advocate for science education is pretty fantastic . Miss District of Columbia Kára McCullough dazzled their way into their crowning moment , but unfortunately not without perpetuating one of the oldest myths about feminism as an ideology .
In response to the question , “ What do you consider feminism to be and do you consider yourself a feminist ? ” , McCullough took a moment before responding with :
“ As a woman scientist in the government , I 'd like to transpose the word feminism to equalism . I try not to consider myself this diehard , like , I do n't really care about men . ”
McCullough then went on to explain that they not only appreciated , but wanted to inspire more women in and into leadership roles , especially in their own field of science . But by equating feminism with hating men , they inadvertently dismiss not just the many men who identify as feminists , but more importantly diminishes the gender equality that feminism has championed over the years — including workplace equality .
Twitter users quickly chimed in with their “ Girl , what… ” reactions . ( Many of the responses also side-eyed McCullough 's assertion that healthcare is a privilege , not a right . )

For those users who found fault with McCullough 's equalist answer , they latched onto Miss New Jersey Chhavi Verg 's response to the same question :
“ I do consider myself a feminist . There 's this misconception when people that feminism is women being better than men , but it 's really not . It 's a fight for equality . ”

Let it be clear , in 2017 , that judging a person based on a “ gotcha ” feminism question is n't the most helpful or educational dialogue . Miss USA 's title and visibility mean that they get to promote actual goals , which have equalist values that are also feminist values . The two have never been mutually exclusive terms , and there 's no value at all in pretending otherwise .

A few weeks ago we had ‘ Woodsgate ' , and in a game where USC was playing we now have ‘ Scottgate ' . Arizona quarterback Matt Scott took a kick to the head and was immediately witnessed and reported throwing up . Concussions are mainly a subjective injury , meaning we can not “ see ” what is going on , however , there are times when a player/person exhibits signs of a traumatic head injury .
It has been my experience as an athletic trainer and one who deeply studies concussions that signs are often the best information we can get as clinicians/health care providers . I have never been around a player that has had overt signs such as : balance disturbance , slurred speech , wandering eyes or VOMITING and not had a concussion .
Oh , Scott was returned to play…
I could and have gone on about this many times ( see the ‘ Woodsgate ' link above or another Pac-12 team and ‘ Lockergate ' a few years back ) , but I believe Dan Diamond did an excellent piece on this for Forbes ;
Congratulations , University of Arizona . Your football team just scored a big win over USC–partly because your quarterback played through an almost-certain concussion . To be fair , it was your biggest victory in two whole years . And the NCAA 's not going to penalize you , so why protect your player ? It 's not like we 've learned anything about football and head injuries . [ … ] By keeping Scott on the field , Arizona had little to lose , other than the game ; the NCAA 's concussion policy is toothless and links to some of their head-injury resources do n't even appear to be working on their website . ( Try clicking on “ Behind the Blue Disk : NCAA 's Approach to Concussions. ” ) And despite everything we know about head injuries , the culture of complicity extends to those who cover the sport . I did n't actually watch the game , but was told that the announcers were blasé about Scott playing through their big hit . The initial write-ups on ESPN and elsewhere did n't mention the sequence of events ; others even celebrated Scott 's toughness . “ Arizona Wildcats upset USC Trojans behind Matt Scott 's heart , ” wrote SB Nation 's Kevin Zimmerman . ( This is n't an isolated incident . Just a few weeks ago , USC star receiver Robert Woods took a shot to the head in a game vs. Utah , stumbled around the field , and was administered a simple three-question concussion test before being allowed back on the field within minutes . As Utah Jazz announcer David Locke pointed out on Twitter , the two events show that “ much of [ the ] concussion talk is lip service , ” at least on the college level . )
Diamond is right , when it comes to winning and protecting student-athletes unfortunately some schools just do n't get it , perhaps never will .
Although not chronicled enough are the good decisions teams and medical staffs make . One example is that of Notre Dame and their starting QB , Everett Golson . In a tight game late against Stanford Golson took a hard hit and was clearly ( to this observer ) suffering signs of head trauma . The medical staff , headed by Athletic Trainer Rob Hunt , removed Golson and did n't flinch . The next week when Golson had not been progressing well enough , they sat them when ND played BYU . With a properly managed concussion Golson was back on the field in their starting role this past week as The Irish stunned Oklahoma .
It is OK to miss a game . I really wish the NCAA and the Pac-12 would reign in their teams… There are examples of good decisions .
A Swedish union has set up a hotline for workers to report instances of “ mansplaining ” as part of a weeklong effort to raise awareness of a certain kind of condescending elocution that men use to explain to women things they already understand .
Well , actually , it 's not all men who do it , of course , but a certain kind of man . You know him : They are probably getting ready to mansplain this article to you .
The hotline , which is temporary and open to men and women , was set up by Unionen , a trade union that represents about 600,000 private-sector employees in Sweden and describes itself as the largest white-collar union in the world .
“ Our objective is to contribute to awareness and start a discussion which we hope will be the first step in changing the way we treat each other and talk about each other in the workplace , ” Jennie Zetterström , a union spokesperson , said in an email on Wednesday .
Re : [ Shadowrun ] a rules lite announcement ?
I 'm ... at the point where I 'd love to answer more , but ca n't . Partially this is due to NDAs not letting me get too into detail on this stuff ( my bosses have n't actually formally announced the game yet at all , so I 'm fuzzy on how much detail they plan on releasing ) . I 'm not trying to play some cutesy `` tee hee '' keeping-secrets game , here , I just also do n't want to jeopardize , y'know , my employment .
So `` Yes , it 's real , '' `` Yes , it 's a more narrative approach to Shadowrun , '' are about as specific as I think I can get . Alongside the name ( Anarchy ) , I really do n't know how much more I can/should say .
ETA : All of which , of course , led to me forgetting to post what I actually meant to post . Share questions you have ! I will post them to my bosses and see which of them I can answer , and how . I ca n't promise it 'll be super fast ( they 're always pretty busy ) , but I 'll forward on everything I can , and come back with whatever answers I 'm able . I 'm psyched about this project , and I want them to know the community is curious .
The Google Play Store is finally catching up to Apple by offering a critical promotional tool for developers : app promo codes .
This allows devs to give out a code that 's then redeemed in the Play Store for free downloads or in-app upgrades . According to the developer console help page , devs are allowed a total of 500 promo codes per quarter . The 500-code limit includes any combination of app giveaways or in-app promos , though unused codes do n't carry over to the next quarter .
Google offered up a few suggestions for how the codes could be put to use :
A game could have a special item , such as a character or decoration , that 's only available to players who attend an event . The developer could distribute cards with promo codes at the event , and users would enter their promo code to unlock the item .
An app developer might distribute promo codes at local businesses , to encourage potential users to try the app .
An app developer might give out “ friends and family ” codes to its employees to share with their friends .
There 's a little more legwork to perform if you are thinking of giving away in-app content with a promo code , which is explained in a Google help page .
Why this matters : This feature is long overdue , considering it 's been available for iOS and Mac developers for years . This will greatly simplify the process of sending out apps to the media or fans to try out the latest creation . Previous to this , developers had to work out their own system for promotional in-app upgrades or hand out the APK to get others to try out their app .
This story , `` Google Play Store finally adds support for app promo codes '' was originally published by Greenbot .
Anger grows over rising prices in Sri Lanka
By our reporters
11 April 2008
Sri Lanka 's official annualised inflation rate skyrocketed to 28 percent in March , up from 24 percent in February . Prices for essential food items are soaring—the inflation rate for food and beverages reached a staggering 37 percent—while transport prices and housing rents followed with 24 percent and 11 percent respectively .
Over the past three months , the Colombo Consumer Price Index ( CCPI ) has jumped by 487 points , from 5,955 in December to 6,442 in March , and the impact is sharply eroding the living standards of workers , the rural poor and students . People are particularly angry because the price of rice , the main staple food in Sri Lanka , has nearly doubled since January last year , causing immense hardship . Worse conditions lie ahead . The government has admitted that bread prices could rise to 100 rupees by the end of this year , a threefold increase .
Nervous about the rising discontent , the government asked India to supply rice stocks . However , India has curbed exports of 40 items , including rice , because of shortages and rising inflation at home . The Colombo government then turned to Pakistan , but received a similar response , and has now sent the trade minister to Myanmar to ask for imports from there . According to the United Nations , Cambodia , China and Vietnam have also restricted exports .
These difficulties highlight the global character of the crisis , with prices for rice , flour , milk powder and other essential food items , as well as oil , rising at unprecedented rates . The UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs , Sir John Holmes , warned a conference in Dubai this week that escalating prices would trigger protests and riots in vulnerable countries . They said food prices had risen globally by an average of 40 percent since the middle of last year .
Several factors produced by global capitalism are driving the shortages and price hikes worldwide . These include the vast urbanisation taking place in China , India and other countries formerly dominated by small farming , the diversion of land and crops to produce bio-fuels , and widespread speculation in food and other commodities . In its latest World Economic Outlook , issued this week , the International Monetary Fund stated that because of the losses hitting financial markets , investors were pulling funds out of financial assets to buy metals , oil and food staples .
In Sri Lanka , the situation has been exacerbated by huge increases in military spending after the government of President Mahinda Rajapakse plunged the island back to war in 2006 . Around 167 billion rupees ( $ US1.5 billion ) has been allocated for defence expenditure this year , a 20 percent increase from the budget presented last November . To pay for the war , the government has increased taxes , borrowed at high interest rates and run the printing presses . All of these measures have pushed prices higher .
WSWS correspondents spoke to workers , students and youth about the increasing cost of living . They expressed deep discontent and hostility toward Rajapakse 's government for imposing the burden on ordinary people .
Plantation workers are among the worst affected . Most of them still live in very small line rooms built during British colonial rule and are not provided with even basic facilities . Now their families have started to skip one meal a day .
Subramaniyam from Strathdon Plantations in Hatton said : “ Under Rajapakse , prices have increased three-fold . We went on strike in December 2006 , demanding the doubling of our daily wage to 300 rupees ( $ US 2.7 ) . At that time , one kilogram of flour cost 22 rupees , a kilo of rice was 25 rupees , one litre of kerosene oil was 32 rupees , and a coconut cost 12 rupees . See the change now ! These prices are now 75 , 80 , 80 and 45 rupees respectively .
“ This government is spending millions of rupees on war every day . If the war were stopped , a lot of the problem would be solved . I know that the prices of oil and flour are increasing on the world market . But when there is a 5-rupee increase globally , we get a 10-rupee increase . Workers want to fight against this oppression and improve their living standards but there 's no leadership . ”
Jatheesan , 48 , a father of four children from the Panmoor Estate at Hatton , said : “ I just ca n't imagine my family 's future under this unbearable cost of living . These days we do n't have three meals a day like we did before . If growing children do n't get proper meals they become sick , and I ca n't work without proper meals continuously . If we become sick , there are no medical facilities available . We have to travel to another estate , which is six kilometres away .
“ Trade union leaders speak and give interviews to the media , claiming that the plantation sector welfare system has improved very much , but it has gone from bad to worse . We get only 200 rupees per day . Very rarely do we get the attendance allowance of 120 rupees—unless you work for 25 days you do n't get it . Just imagine what you can buy for 200 rupees a day for a family . ”
S. Kaliammah , a retired female worker , explained that a 400-gram packet of milk powder now sold for 275 rupees , up from 190 rupees in January . Plantation families were compelled to dilute the milk powder with more water . They showed us the conditions inside a line room , built in 1912 . It had no proper water facilities and no toilet . “ We have n't seen any improvement in living standards during our lifetime , other than it is getting worse , ” they said .
Workers in the free trade zones are faring little better . About 50,000 workers , mostly female , are employed in the Katunayake Export Processing Zone . Fear has spread that the US economic slowdown will impact on their jobs because the US is the largest market for Sri Lankan garment exports . Workers at two Jaqalanka factories did not receive their full salaries in January and the two operations closed down in early February , throwing about 1,400 people out of work .
Nishanthi , a young female employee of the US-owned Smart Garment , told us : “ I have been working for one year . When I started , my basic salary was 6,200 rupees ( $ US59 ) per month . As a result of a strike last December , we gained a 1,500-rupee increase . If we do overtime we can earn some more , but then our working hours lengthen to 12 hours . Our attendance allowance is cut if we take leave .
“ I share my house rent of 2,000 rupees [ a month ] with another colleague . For cooking we use kerosene oil , the price of which has gone up several times last year and this year . Prices of rice , soap , biscuits , milk powder , clothes and other things have gone up by two- to three-fold compared to a year ago . We ca n't have a proper meal .
“ We have had to stop consuming many things , including milk powder . We ca n't buy clothes as we did earlier . With difficulty , I deposit 1,000 rupees in a bank account for my child every month , but we ca n't think about the future .
“ I voted for the present government , hoping it would do something for the poor . The Sri Lanka Freedom Party [ SLFP—the main partner in the ruling coalition ] and the United National Party [ UNP ] have ruled the country successively but nothing has been done for the poor .
“ I agree that the war is contributing to the increased prices for essentials . And there is no economic development that we can feel . The war must be stopped—its victims are poor people . We ca n't even travel by bus due to fear of the war . What we need is a peaceful society that has affordable prices for the working people . ”
L.S . De Soyza , a railway worker from the Ratmalana Industrial Zone on the outskirts of Colombo , said their take home pay was 7,000 rupees monthly , after deductions for loan repayments . They have three children , only two of whom are employed . They pay 800 rupees for rent , 1,000 rupees for electricity and 1,200 for the telephone bill .
“ I have debts of hundreds of thousands of rupees to banks because I use credit cards and overdrafts to bridge my family 's monthly expenditure . The better part of my salary goes for food . Not enough is left to cover other expenses such as transport and clothing . ”
Soyza said that while the government insisted price increases were due only to world market changes , the prices of locally produced food items were also going up .
They explained : “ I am not a supporter of the war . There are so many injustices happening to the Tamil people . They are denied jobs and management positions . This ethnic issue can not be solved through war . I think the government is fooling the Sinhala masses by promising a victory . ”
Soyza is disgusted with the trade union leaders in the government-owned railway service . “ Some leaders say they are trying to get wage increases . But others such as the JVP [ Peoples Liberation Front , a Sinhala chauvinist party ] leaders are supporting the government and praising it for launching the war . I do not see any of the old parties fighting to improve the living and social conditions of working people . ”
Indika , a final year art student at Colombo University , said students were struggling to cope up with rising prices .
“ I have to spend 30 rupees per day for travelling . I take breakfast and lunch from the university canteen because it is given at a subsidised rate . For those two meals I now have to pay about 50 rupees . In 2005 , a plate of rice and curry , with two or three vegetables , and fish , meat or egg , was 13 rupees . Now it is 25 rupees . They are going to increase it to 30 rupees . It is still not a good meal and the quantity is not enough .
For stationery and photocopying I have to spend at least 1,000 rupees per month . Poor students like me receive 2,500 rupees [ a month ] as financial assistance but that is not even enough to cover essential expenditure . Many students are forced to do part-time jobs and we have no time or money even to see a film . ”
Catholics from a range of influential posts -- former U.S. ambassadors , national representatives of theologians , sisters and more -- called Wednesday for new gun control measures , naming Catholic members of Congress seen as roadblocks to tighter regulations .
The 64 Catholics among those signing the letter , released by nonprofit group Faith in Public Life , call on people who consider themselves pro-life to support new gun control measures , saying people `` who share a firm commitment to these values '' have `` no excuse for inaction . ''
Among the signers are Miguel Diaz , until recently U.S . Ambassador to the Holy See , and Thomas Melady , who held that post under President George H.W . Bush .
The signers asked Catholic members of Congress -- including Republicans House Speaker John Boehner and Congressman Paul Ryan and Democratic Senators Joe Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp -- to `` stand up to the National Rifle Association and other gun lobbyists who choose to obstruct sensible reforms . ''
`` We urge you to reflect on the wisdom in our church 's call for a 'consistent ethic of life ' as you consider legislation in the coming months that can provide greater protection for our families and communities , '' the letter states .

Those who signed the letter include Franciscan Sr. Florence Deacon , the president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious ; Francis Doyle , a former associate general secretary of the U.S. bishops ' conference ; and Marie Dennis , co-president of Pax Christi International .
Also included is the leadership team of the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas , one of the largest groups of Catholic sisters in the western hemisphere , and leaders of both the College Theology Society and the Catholic Theological Society of America .
Wednesday 's letter comes a week after a similar letter calling for new gun control measures garnered the signatures of the leaders of the Catholic Health Association , the Conference of Major Superiors of Men , and Stockton , Calif. , Bishop Stephen Blaire , chairperson of the U.S. bishops ' Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development .
Mentioning statements from the U.S. bishops and the Vatican calling for more stringent gun control measures , the 64 signers conclude : `` The complexity of this urgent challenge must not be an excuse for protecting the status quo when it comes to regulating the sale and use of lethal weapons . ''
`` President Obama and Members of Congress can honor the memories of those killed in Newtown , Conn. , and work to prevent future tragedies by acting now . ''

I wrote this piece with my colleague Devin McCarthy .
On August 29th , the Republican Party unveiled its 2012 Party Platform . Nestled inside the platform is a direct condemnation of the National Popular Vote plan ( NPV ) -- the state-based campaign to guarantee election of the candidate who wins the most popular votes in all 50 states and DC . This section of the GOP platform opposing NPV and apparently other changes to states ' current Electoral College rules reads as follows :
We oppose the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact or any other scheme to abolish or distort the procedures of the Electoral College . We recognize that an unconstitutional effort to impose 'national popular vote ' would be a mortal threat to our federal system and a guarantee of corruption as every ballot box in every state would become a chance to steal the presidency .
The language is almost comically hyperbolic . NPV is termed a `` mortal threat '' to our federal system despite having zero impact on a broad range of powers granted to states in the Constitution . In fact , NPV is grounded in states using powers that are explicitly delegated to them in the Constitution : their plenary power over how to allocate electoral votes and their frequently-exercised right to enter into interstate compacts to facilitate cooperation in policy-making .
Acting on those federal powers makes eminent sense for state legislators who are not afraid of representative democracy . In today 's regionally polarized politics , it is indisputable that the current system hurts most states . The huge majority of states are ignored by campaigns under the winner-take-all method of allocating state electors because the outcomes in these states are not in doubt .
This winner-take-all system was n't used by most states early in our country 's history and was opposed by American political giants like James Madison and Thomas Jefferson . It ultimately became the norm because partisan majorities in states realized that it was the best way to help their party . Once in place , the winner-take-all rule has seemed impossible to change because of those same partisan interests . The National Popular Vote plan provides a way out of this dilemma by establishing a nationwide election that creates a level playing field for both major parties .
The platform 's final clause is even more appalling . Suggesting that avoiding corruption is a reason to oppose a system where every vote counts equally is an indictment of holding elections based on one-person , one-vote . It elevates fear of voter fraud over the goal of representing the will of the people -- a backwards-thinking notion that is contrary to the principles of representative democracy on which our republic was founded .
Take , for example , the fact that the Constitution mandates that every state should hold popular vote elections for the U.S. House of Representatives . That provision means that we have never had a single House Member who was n't elected by a popular vote system -- in other words , a system in which `` every ballot box '' might be the means to `` steal '' the election . Taken to its logical extreme , the new platform language would suggest that we seriously consider avoiding fraud by letting state legislators pick electors directly , as was common before the Civil War .
It has been disturbing to see NPV opponents within the Republican Party seek to make it a partisan issue . They build their case primarily on appeals to emotion -- gross distortions about how NPV works along with partisan appeals based on the 2000 election results and alleged connections between some NPV advocates and George Soros .
Adding potential fuel to the partisan fire , 2000 Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore spoke out in favor of the national popular vote in a panel discussion on the Current TV network last week . Gore had supported the current system even after their loss in 2000 despite winning the national popular vote . But Gore said that today 's political realities have made it clear to them that in the winner-take-all Electoral College , too few states count . Electing a president who did n't receive the most votes is problematic , to be sure , and is an outcome just as likely to hurt Republicans as Democrats . In 2004 , for instance , a switch of fewer than 60,000 votes in Ohio would have resulted in a defeat for George Bush despite their national popular vote advantage of more than three million votes . But the core problem with the status quo is that year after year it will relegate the same states to being perennial spectators in presidential elections .
It 's tempting to suggest that Gore 's support for NPV and the Republican platform 's opposition to it cement a partisan split on the NPV issue . But it is Gore 's position , not the GOP platform 's , that has history on its side . The trajectory of our nation 's history has been towards making our democracy more representative -- and many Republicans agree . Republicans backing a national popular vote for president include former presidents George Herbert Walker Bush , Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon . NPV 's founding advisory committee members include former U.S . Senators Jake Garn ( R-UT ) and David Durenberger ( R-MN ) , while active backers include 2008 presidential candidate Fred Thompson , former American Legislative Exchange Council chair Ray Haynes and hundreds of Republican state legislators .
A Juneau school bus carrying students was struck by a bullet Wednesday afternoon after a handgun was accidentally fired from a nearby home , according to police .
Juneau Police Department Lt. Kris Sell said no injuries were reported in the incident , which occurred on Riverside Drive in Mendenhall Valley shortly before 4 p.m. Wednesday . The First Student bus had a driver and an aide on board , as well as two students .
`` The bus driver said a window of the bus shattered and two men in their twenties came running toward the bus '' from a nearby home , Sell wrote . `` One of the men , a 21-year-old man from Juneau , was identified as the man who shot a round from a Glock 9mm handgun through the front door of the home . ''
Sell said Thursday morning that the man was apparently `` dry-firing '' the Glock , pulling the trigger on an empty chamber , and pointing it out of the home at the time of the discharge . They immediately approached the bus and admitted what happened .
`` He did not believe that there were rounds in the magazine , '' Sell said . `` It 's not an uncommon thing for gun owners to do but you have to be extremely careful that it 's not loaded — obviously , the care to be sure it was n't loaded did not happen . ''
The pistol round was found lodged in a window frame on the bus , Sell said .
`` The bus driver did say that the kids were not scared and were not aware that something had happened , '' Sell said .
Police forwarded to local prosecutors a misdemeanor charge of shooting a firearm within a quarter-mile of a roadway against the 21-year-old , who has n't been identified pending formal charges . Sell said First Student did n't immediately press charges .
Juneau School District Superintendent Mark Miller said Thursday that the children on the bus were Mendenhall River Community School special-education students headed home for the day . They had harsh words for the man who fired the gun .
`` By all accounts it was unintentional but it 's still irresponsible , '' Miller said . `` You have to always treat a gun like it 's loaded — that 's the first thing they teach you in gun safety . ''
Sell expressed relief that nobody was struck — as well as amazement that the randomly discharged round hit a school bus .
zwomally asked : We have another Standard environment with a top level Lilliana and Gideon . I get you want to push the Gatewatch but the same ones are a little tiring .
When we started with the Gatewatch storyline , we began with the assumption that the Gatewatch , the core five , at least , should always be represented on planeswalker cards in Standard . ( And remember Standard was 18 months at the time . ) As we started to roll this plan out , we got feedback from many of you that this was problematic .
Yes , you wanted Gatewatch planeswalkers but we did n't need to do them so often . You wanted the opportunity to see other favorites return or have new planeswalkers in some of those slots .
We heard you , but we work far ahead so there 's always a gap before you can see us react to feedback . Hours of Devastation was the first set that we could revamp how we did this . So starting with Hour , we 've pulled back significantly on how often Gatewatch planeswalkers appear . They 'll appear when it 's important but at a much slower rate . We will use those slots instead to do more returning and new planeswalkers .
( Reuters ) - The U.S. government said on Tuesday it was delaying indefinitely its proposal for how to clean up or seal off radioactive soil buried in a St. Louis-area landfill adjacent to another waste site where an underground fire has been smoldering for several years .
The postponement by the Environmental Protection Agency , citing lags in receiving “ technical documents ” needed to formulate its plan , drew an outcry from local officials angry at the potential public health hazard posed by the site .
A remediation plan for the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton , Missouri , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) northeast of St. Louis , had been expected from the EPA by the end of this year .
But the EPA decided to “ extend the timeline ” to allow for further documentation and review by experts , the agency said . No new deadline was set .
“ Given the complexity of this site and potential community impacts , we must ensure that sound science is driving our decision-making , ” EPA regional chief Mark Hague said .
The West Lake site , originally used for agriculture , became a limestone quarry in 1939 . But starting in the 1950s , portions of the area were used to dispose of municipal refuse , industrial wastes and construction debris .
In 1973 , some 8,700 tons of leached radioactive barium sulfate from the Manhattan Project , the World War Two-era atomic bomb-development program , were mixed with 38,000 tons of soil used to cover trash dumped at the site , according to the EPA .
In 1990 , the landfill and neighboring waste-disposal facilities occupying a total of 200 acres ( 80 hectares ) were designated by the EPA as a single Superfund site .
Adding to concerns , a slow-burning chemical fire has been smoldering since 2010 beneath the surface of the adjacent Bridgeton Landfill , coming within 1,200 feet ( 365 meters ) of the West Lake Landfill .
The company that operates both landfills , acting under EPA orders , has since installed a barrier system of heat-extraction wells and other safeguards to keep the fire from reaching the radioactive waste .
The EPA is now deciding whether to proceed with one of three remediation options for West Lake - permanently cap the waste and keep it isolated underground ; remove some of the waste and leave a portion of it buried ; or excavate all the waste .
St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger expressed anger at the EPA 's postponement on Tuesday .
“ It is extremely disappointing and hard to believe that there is yet another delay in EPA 's cleanup of the West Lake Landfill , ” they said . “ It is time for a permanent solution . ”
Following months of negotiations , the federal government will announce $ 1.3 billion in funding for Montreal 's light-rail project on Thursday , Radio-Canada has learned .
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard , Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre and the head of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec , Michael Sabia , are expected to make the announcement in Montreal .
The decision comes a few months after the Trudeau government made no mention of funding the project in their spring budget , prompting concern from Couillard .
The price tag for the 67-kilometre rail line ( LRT ) , which would link downtown with the South Shore and the West Island , has risen to $ 6 billion in order to add more stations in the city 's downtown area .
Quebec has already committed around $ 1.3 billion to the project . The province 's pension fund manager , the Caisse , has pledged close to $ 3 billion .
The LRT project now includes 27 stations . The first trains are expected to run in 2020 .
Certain terms have been very trendy of late and the one that has pissed off a great many people is the infamous “ rape culture ” . There is no point in rehashing what that meme is supposed to mean , because I want to have a life and do n't have a millennium to waste on debunking feminists ' ideology , their manipulation of social psychology , and the engineering on Moral Panic going back at least 40 years . “ Rape-crisis feminism ” has been a toxic cocktail of misinformation , mythology and social bullying since the 1970 's . Even RAINN has had enough , and is now very publicly distancing itself away from the rape culture meme . They are even telling that to The White House .
I 'm always nosy about what is going on behind the scenes . I 'm too old , too jaded and way too realistic to accept anything on-line at face value . What is interesting is looking at other things that are trendy , and even using Google Trends . You type in a word or phrase and Google lets you know what has been getting used , how much and when . It can even show you where the trend is happening . It 's not 100 % accurate but it is a reliable snapshot .
I did a simple experiment – I typed in “ rape culture ” and compared it with the word “ misandry ” . And the results say :
Just in case you were not able to believe your eyes – yes “ misandry ” is the red line and statistically it 's used more than “ rape culture ” . For the last 8 whole years the word “ misandry ” has been trendier than “ rape culture ” .
This leads to one very large question : If misandry is being talked about so much on the net , and it 's trendier than rape culture , why is it so little mentioned in mainstream media ?
Someone tells a rape joke and it 's front page news , but someone passes a law that specifically disadvantages men and you fight to find any mention , except in the feedback asking why the subject is getting ignored . Question rape culture and contrast it with real world male issues and all you get thrown back at you is derision and “ What About Teh Menz ? ”
I have a theory , and it 's called advertising revenues . The honey trap is “ rape culture , ” which appeals to the one group who have been found to buy on-line and page graze from subject to subject , page to page , shopping venue to shopping venue . In so many ways we saw that last year with the Feminist FaceBook rape campaign – control the media and you control their revenues streams too .
Misandry gets used by people who do n't behave that way so they get advertised at less and are less useful to so many people 's bank balances .
Male Disposability is even being articulated by the subroutines that search the net , measure content and show the trends – cool hard rational computing gets the reality , but the wetware of journalist infected with the “ rape culture ” meme leaves half the population ignored and reality skewed .
But then again they have to justify reality to their editors and the editors measure content by revenue and income . It seems that until men stop being trendy and drive the media marketplace mad for male money , disposability will reign .
Ladies of Irving , beware . A serial groper -- or gropers -- is on the loose .
According to an Irving PD news release , at least eight women and girls in recent months have reported `` being inappropriately touched on the buttocks '' in the southeastern part of the city .
Most of the assaults have happened in the southeastern part of the city on Friday or Saturday morning between 6 and 8:30 a.m. Descriptions of the suspect ( s ) have varied . Some women they were groped by a man who was tall and slender while others say their assailant was short and heavy-set . Their reports generally agree that the groper is a Hispanic male between the ages of 25 and 45. bald . Some said the man was bald . Others saw them wearing painter 's pants and a gray or dark-colored hoodie .
Same-sex couples looking to get married have n't felt so welcome in Las Vegas . Bloomberg/Getty
Bill James and Danny Murray waited . As long ago as 2005 , they considered tying the knot in Massachusetts . Then , as other states began to recognize same-sex marriage , they thought about doing it in New York , then in Washington , D.C. , maybe even in Iowa where Murray 's sister lives . But the Texas couple really wanted to wed in Las Vegas , where they met at a technology convention in 1988 and have returned almost yearly for their anniversary . They envisioned something over-the-top , perhaps with an Elvis impersonator or Cirque du Soleil performers . Even as a parade of states and other nations legalized gay marriage via popular vote , legislative action or judicial fiat , the self-proclaimed Marriage Capital of the World remains unavailable to same-sex couples , thanks to a 2002 amendment to its state constitution limiting marriage to a union between heterosexuals . As loyal as they had been to their Vegas nuptials dream , James and Murray decided they could no longer delay when the IRS decided in August to allow legally wed same-sex couples to file taxes jointly as spouses regardless of where they live . In November , they got hitched in Palm Springs , Calif. “ It 's crazy that Vegas does n't allow it , but at some point , you give up and live your life , ” said Murray , 60 . “ I mean , they just started allowing it in Utah . But Nevada remains stuck in the past. ” Stuck may , indeed , be the operative word . The state 's legislature began repealing its constitutional ban this year , but it 's a convoluted , multiyear process that ca n't come to fruition until 2017 at the earliest . A pending federal lawsuit may undo the ban , too — as a similar lawsuit did in late December in neighboring Utah — but the timetable is unclear . Unlike in Utah , the federal judge in Nevada upheld the ban 's constitutionality in November 2012 , and litigants are now waiting for word as to when the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the matter . Meanwhile , same-sex marriage is now recognized by 18 states , plus Washington , D.C. , leaving a tourism-dependent state known for its live-and-let-live ethos — one once famed for its quickie weddings and divorces and never a place associated with the sanctity of traditional marriages — left at what might have been a very lucrative altar . “ Sure it 's frustrating , ” said Ron DeCar , co-owner of the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel . “ With everything else Nevada has to offer , especially in Las Vegas , it 's baffling why it has n't happened here . If it does n't happen soon , by the time we actually get it , there 'll probably be 10 more states ahead of us . We 'll be one of the last ones , which is ridiculous . ”
All dressed up ...
It also damages a brand that has taken a beating in recent years . Once-booming Nevada was the epitome of the Great Recession , besieged by the steepest decline in home values and a brutal drop in tourism and business-convention revenue . Even as the housing crisis has eased , the state has consistently had one of the nation 's highest unemployment rates — 9 percent as of December . The wedding industry has been particularly devastated , chapel-industry lobbyist George Flint said . Last year there were just 8,000 marriage licenses issued in Washoe County , which includes Reno , marking the county 's lowest number since 1937 , they said . Clark County , which includes Las Vegas , remains the world 's marriage-license leader , with more than 80,000 issued in 2013 . But that , too , is down from the 2004 heyday , when the county issued more than 128,000 licenses . Flint testified at the Nevada legislature in 2013 that legalizing same-sex marriage could mean as much as $ 90 million in new business for an industry weakened both by recession and a liberalization of marriage laws across the nation that makes it less necessary to slip off to Vegas or Reno . Economist Lee Badgett of the Williams Institute at UCLA , a think tank focused on gay issues , put the figure closer to $ 52 million over the first three years . Regardless of the exact amount , Flint and Badgett agree that the windfall diminishes as the years pass and other states make gay marriage legal . Especially damaging to Nevada 's prospects are California , where same-sex marriages resumed last summer after a four-year pause , and Hawaii , where gays began getting wed on Dec. 2 . “ If it happens in Nevada next year , the revenue would be one number , but if it 's five years from now , it 'll be a much smaller number , ” Badgett said . “ There are hundreds of thousands of couples that are likely to get married in the next five years . If Nevada had been in on the front end , they 'd be able to make a clear case for that business . Now there 's someone new every week . ”
Tourism suffering ?
Continuing to interpret Article 239AA that gave special powers to Delhi , the Supreme Court today orally observed that it envisages harmonious functioning between the Lt Governor and the state cabinet and the spirit should be “ participatory ” .
Significantly Chief Justice Dipak Misra also said there is also no scope for the Governor to interfere in day to day functioning of the government .
“ Actually it has to be participative governance . There has to be some kind of harmony . Yes there can not be day to day interference by the Governor . Even if there is interference or discussion some sanctity has to be added .. it should be value oriented , reason oriented .. our role is as a final interpreter .we can not actually carve out area of discretion .. on where all there can be differences .. what the parliament envisaged has to be in order .. what was intended by the amendment can not be disturbed .. the intent has to be respected ” , CJI Misra heading a five judge constitution bench said .
The bench is hearing a batch of petitions filed by Delhi government against the Delhi High Court judgment of August last year which declared the Lt Governor as the “ administrative head ” of Delhi and ruled that they are not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers .
The remarks come four days after the bench said that “ prima facie ” the constitution gave primacy to the lieutenant governor in the affairs of Delhi , but observed that the L-G can not sit on files sent for approval by an elected government .
The apex court seemed to agree with this view and said that “ land , police , and public order ” are not under the purview of the Delhi government .
Still , “ the L-G can not stultify an executive decision by sitting over a file . They must exercise their power in a reasonable time , ” the bench had observed .
The bench said difference of opinion should not be on matters of trivial nature . “ LG should differ with Council of Ministers keeping in mind the citizenry 's trust and also keep in mind that that they are an august head ” , said the CJI .
GOPAL SUBRAMANIUM 'S ARGUMENTS
The comments from the bench came after Gopal Subramanium , senior counsel who began arguments for the Delhi government alleged that the governor was interfering in day to day governance which caused delay and had almost paralyzed governance .
“ He wants to give their opinion on every file .. he wants to demonstrate supervening power .. he also thinks they have powers to overrule decisions taken by the government without reference to President . Even the High Court upheld the power and that is what actually hurt us ” , they said .
CJI Misra then asked Subramanium .. ” so you say that .. government takes any decision and asks LG to endorse .. if they agree its fine and if they disagree it has to go to president but now you are saying the decision singularly taken by the Governor ” .
Subramanium said “ every file is being summoned ... direction given to override final decision of the government . That is not permissible ”
“ He can not interfere with day to day governance . Summon every file take a decision this is a serious issue .. he is a titular head .. where all they can interfere is clearly provided .. the proviso is a safeguard against transgression ” , argued Subramanium .
What senior advocate for Delhi government Gopal Subramanium argued on the issue of Difference of opinion between the Lt . Governor and their Ministers .
The Proviso to Clause ( 4 ) of Article 239 AA says that in case of difference of opinion between the Lt . Governor and their ministers ON ANY MATTER , the Lt . Governor shall refer it to the President whose decision shall be final . The crucial words are “ on any matter ” .
The Proviso follows the provision which vests in the executive power to aid and advice the Lt . Governor in the exercise of their functions in respect of all matters within the legislative jurisdiction of the Assembly . In our constitutional democracy , the Governor of a State can act only on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers except in matters which fall within their discretionary jurisdiction . It simply means that final decision making is vested in the Council of Ministers . Since the same phraseology is used in clause 4 , it would carry the same meaning .
Thus the final decision making power in respect of all matters in the State List and the Concurrent List in the NCT except Police , Public order and land , is vested in the Council of Ministers
If these words are interpreted to mean all matters within the jurisdiction of the Council of Ministers , then the Lt . Governor with the intention of making the govt . ineffective can discover differences on all matters and refer them to the President , which means the Central Govt. , the govt . of NCT will not be able to take final decision on any matter .
The Council of Ministers will effectively cease to be accountable to the Assembly and thus a serious constitutional crisis will arise . This interpretation will make the Council of Ministers inherently incapable of being responsible to the Assembly . This interpretation , therefore , should be discarded . The proper thing to do is read down these words to mean only the overlapping matters between the reserved list of the Lt . Governor and the general list .
Even when Article 239 AA ( 3 ) clearly demarcates the jurisdiction of the Assembly and the Lt . Governor still there may be matters on which there can be differences in respect of jurisdictions . Such matters can be referred to the superior authority , the President . This interpretation will smoothen the functioning of the Govt . of NCT .

The final bell rings at Biddeford High School and kids begin to file out of their classrooms . The Maine Red Claws , displaced from their usual abode at the Portland Expo Center , concluded the day 's practice only minutes ago . Just as players finish changing into street clothes , the after-school rush hits the gym . “ Extracurricular activity ” is a phrase that gets thrown around frequently in professional basketball ( usually to denote an in-game skirmish ) but in this situation , the phrase seems a little more appropriate .
As the chatter of students fills the room , 21-year-old Guerschon Yabusele , the 6 ' 9 , 270-pound power forward , takes in their surroundings .
“ It 's my first time coming into a high school gym , ” Yabusele says laughing , their voice dripping in a strong French accent . “ Now the kids are coming to the gym because school is out . It 's funny to see a little bit of American school . ”
There are no autograph seekers in the bunch . In fact , none of the teenagers even try to talk to Yabusele . A year from now , they might remember this moment and regret that . A year from now , they might turn on their TV and see them decked in green , striding across the famous TD Garden parquet .
* * *
Of Yabusele 's many nicknames , “ The Dancing Bear ” is one of their favorites . Celtics assistant coach Micah Shrewsberry bestowed it on them during a Celtics predraft workout as a compliment of their impeccable footwork .
“ That 's good , that 's funny at the same time . People like it , ” Yabusele said . “ He said that because of my footwork , so to me that 's too funny and I laugh when people call me like that . ”
Yabusele 's credits childhood boxing sessions with their father and years of playing soccer as the foundation for their basketball moves .
“ Definitely the footwork , the quick of the hands , it has really helped me a lot with basketball and you can see right now on the court when I 'm running that I 'm moving pretty well for my weight . ”
Yabusele has also been called the French Draymond , drawing comparisons to the Warriors ' Draymond Green due to their size and playing style .
“ He 's a good comparison . Our game is similar… [ we ] really try to help the team get the win . I think before that , we did n't have a power forward that could really control the game like they do . ”

The Celtics were so impressed with Yabusele , they selected them with the 16th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft . The move surprised many draft analysts as well Yabusele .
“ It was really a surprise , ” Yabusele said . “ Everybody was surprised . Me , my agent , nobody knew so it was amazing . ”
When Yabusele finally had the chance to speak with Celtics President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge during the 2016 NBA Summer League , the Celtics legend was quick to give them advice .
“ He was just saying to work on my game , play smart , and have confidence . ”
During Summer League , Yabusele befriended fellow Celtics 1st round draft pick , Jaylen Brown . They consider Brown one of their closest American friends and says the two have frequently talked through the ups and downs of the season .
* * *
When the preseason ended , the Celtics had a deep roster and some tough choices to make . They decided to let Yabusele play overseas , thereby giving them another year to develop , and also freeing a spot on the roster . Yabusele was an international free agent and received contract offers from teams in several different countries .
“ A couple clubs wanted me and then China came , ” Yabusele said . “ It really came at a good time . ”
Yabusele signed a contract with the Shanghai Sharks . Shanghai is the most populated city in China and the team is owned by NBA Hall of Famer , Yao Ming .
“ [ Yao ] was there every day , even in the beginning of the season and the preseason too , ” Yabusele explained . “ He 'd even come to the restaurants with us . He 's very close to the team . Every home game , they came to the locker room to talk to us a little . ”
Yao saw the great potential in their team 's newest star and tried to help them with the transition to the Chinese Basketball Association .
“ He was just telling me to keep playing with a lot of energy , work on my offense , build up the confidence , grab some rebounds… and try to win a championship ! ”
Over 43 games , Yabusele dominated , averaging 20.9 points and 9.4 rebounds per game . Even with those numbers , they are n't the best performer on their team . Former NBA and D-League player Jimmer Fredette held that honor . Fredette , the CBA 's closest proxy to Steph Curry , was named MVP after averaging 37.6 points per game and scoring 73 points in a game ( the fourth most ever in a CBA game ) .
“ I never played with a great shooter like that . That was something new for me , ” Yabusele said with a deep chuckle . “ I was happy to pass them the ball when they were on fire from 3 . ”
After Yabusele injured their ankle , the Sharks ' season ended with a playoff defeat . They enjoyed their time in China overall except for an incident after that final playoff loss .
“ Somebody stole my jersey ! I do n't know who , ” Yabusele said , laughing . “ I heard about Tom Brady 's jersey getting stolen , but they got their back . I did n't get mine back , but it 's okay though . ”
Following the conclusion of the season in early March , Yabusele returned to Boston to receive treatment for their injured ankle . One of the first people to visit them was their good friend Jaylen Brown . Yabusele also had a chance to meet the rest of the Celtics players . After rehabbing , they signed in to the D-League to play with the Celtics ' affiliate , the Maine Red Claws , for the remainder of their season .

Yabusele feels a strong connection to their fellow Frenchman in the NBA . Growing up , they watched the first generation of impactful French players , Tony Parker and Boris Diaw . Strangely enough , Yabusele has never met either player .
“ I think Parker is the most popular French player , ” Yabusele said . “ When we were growing up , they were the role model . They have a lot of championships with the Spurs . They have a lot of good experience with the French team Asvel . I think a lot of French guys who want to go to NBA , they want to be as much as possible as him , having all of the playoff titles , and the championship with the French team . ”
In 2010 , a 14-year-old Yabusele tried out for the top-tier French team , Cholet . One player stood out among the others ; a 7-ft tower of a human-being . It was a 17-year-old Rudy Gobert ( who is now a star center on the Utah Jazz ) . Yabusele did n't make the team but six years later , the two happened to reconnect :
“ When I played in Utah for the Summer League , they came to say hi . They just remembered me like that . ”
If Yabusele makes the Celtics roster next season , they may finally get their chance to meet Parker and Diaw , and play against Gobert .
When Yabusele worked out for teams prior to the draft , they ran into another successful Frenchman , who was eager to help :
“ I met Evan Fournier at the workout in Orlando . They gave me some good advice how to do everything on the court and how to make the NBA . ”
Yabusele wants to pass on the good will and has a message for young French players who aspire to make the Association .
“ For the French players , keep working and we 'll get more French guys in the NBA , ” Yabusele said . “ You have to work hard every day ; you have to know where you want to go and have confidence .

Michael Grace Jr. was died from a gunshot wound they suffered while trying to rob a Pizza Hut . Grace was shot and killed by an armed restaurant employee , and their mother is upset . Temia Hariston , Grace 's mother , believe it was n't fair for the robbery victims to shoot them son , the robber .
“ If there was to be a death , it was not the place of the employee at Pizza Hut . That is the place of law enforcement , ” Hariston told CBS affiliate WBTV Channel 3 News . “ It was an act of desperation , but I do not believe that Michael would have hurt anyone , ” they continued . “ Why in the hell did this guy have a gun ? This was n't a body shot . This was a headshot . My son was shot in the left side of their head just behind their ear . A headshot is personal . ”
According to their parents , Grace was suffering financial difficulty and resorted to robbery to help provide for their own child . Grace was a former employee of the same Pizza Hut they were attempting to rob , according to Hariston .
Pizza Hut released the following statement ,
“ The local Pizza Hut franchisee is fully cooperating with the Charlotte Police Department as they continue their investigation , but want to stress that the security of its staff is of utmost concern . They are providing support to the team members involved to ensure their health and well-being following this incident . The employee involved in the shooting has been placed on a leave of absence following further review . ”

Dave Rouleau and Monika Benkovich were hired to gentrify the York Rooms . And it seems to have worked . The 36-room hotel was one of many run-down SROs ( single-room occupancy ) now peppered among the high-end restaurants and trendy shops popping up throughout the quickly changing Downtown Eastside of Vancouver . The DTES is known casually as `` Canada 's poorest postal code ; '' a majority of its residents live below the poverty line and struggle with addiction and mental illness alongside a lack of access to proper housing and the services they need . While `` cleaning up the neighbourhood '' might sound like a noble endeavor , it often comes at the expense of residents .
Wendy Pedersen , a long time DTES resident and housing advocate , says that the rent at the York Rooms went from $ 375 per month to around $ 600 , pointing out that welfare rates are only $ 610 a month . SROs previously occupied by the poor are now being advertised as “ trendy Gastown buildings ” suitable for “ musicians , artists , and students. ” Unaffordability aside , Pedersen says landlords at are explicitly discriminating against welfare recipients and Indigenous people in their efforts to create a different `` culture '' in the building .
“ Renovictions ” are a strategy that has been adopted across Vancouver , but most concertedly in Gastown and the DTES , wherein landlords kick renters out of their suites in order to renovate them and increase the rent for the next tenants who move in . Tristan Markle , a member of The Coalition of Progressive Electors ' ( COPE ) housing committee , says they do n't believe these tactics are even legal and wants the city to step in and stop renovictions .
The York Rooms is not the only SRO engaged in efforts to displace marginalized renters and rebrand , but they are representative of the gentrification that is rapidly consuming the DTES ( and , really , Vancouver at large ) . Glass towers emerge at an astounding rate , but remain full of empty suites ( many of which are owned by people who do n't live in them ) , mocking those who ca n't afford to live in them as they are pushed into homelessness .
The irony of a city full of empty apartments contrasted with a dramatic increase in the number of homeless in the past year feels inhumane . Expensive restaurants full of middle to upper class , youngish white folks , trying with embarrassing desperation to join communities that they are slowly pushing out , are opening in locations that allow those living outside to stare in at their new , wealthier , neighbours . Last summer , activists picketed outside of Cuchillo , the high-end restaurant that opened below the York Rooms , signaling to residents that their housing situation was about to change .
Which brings us back to Rouleau and Benkovich . Hired by Living Balance , a company described by activists as `` professional gentrifiers , '' they are part of a strategy used by many landlords wanting to cash in on the newly gentrified area , which often involves intimidation and manipulation in order to force tenants to vacate . Pedersen says `` they hire people like Dave because they need ruthless bullies , '' adding that Rouleau was `` an angry and aggressive character '' who they were scared of . They claimed they targeted activists like them in particular , as they were part of a group that picketed daily outside the York Rooms . `` Some people think it 's bad that we were picketing , but people 's lives are being ruined , '' Pedersen says .
When Mathieu Pierre Youdan reported for The Mainlander that the very same people whose job was to evict impoverished people from their homes and jack up the rent were raising money to produce a documentary about their experiences , many were appalled . `` It 's completely exploitative , '' Pedersen says . `` Some of those people [ in the York Rooms ] were in such a vulnerable mental health state . '' Rouleau 's position of power as manager makes the whole film `` unethical , '' they add .
One would think the City of Vancouver could cap this kind of development and commit to creating affordable housing . But part of the problem may be that they are creating social housing that is not actually affordable . It appears that the ruling civic party , Vision Vancouver , defines `` affordable housing '' in a questionable way in order to justify rezoning and development projects . Last year , under the guise of ensuring `` affordable '' rental housing , the city set a maximum rent developers can charge : $ 1,443 per month for a studio , $ 1,517 for a one-bedroom and $ 2,061 for a two-bedroom apartment . To pretend as though these rents are `` affordable '' to those struggling to survive in this city—particularly the working class or the poor—is disingenuous ..
`` Gentrification is a real thing , '' Markle says . `` This process , wherein wealthy people are recruited to replace poor people , is a widely recognized urban phenomenon . The way that it 's happening in Vancouver is not much different than how it happens in other places and the City absolutely facilitates it . '' Pedersen agrees : `` Vision wants to gentrify Vancouver . '' If this continues , Markle says , `` the city will become more exclusive , more polarized , and more violent towards poor people . ''
Kerry Jang , Vision Vancouver city councilor , feels stuck . `` We 're asked all the time to put in rent controls , but we ca n't . That 's a provincial jurisdiction . '' Beyond that , one of the most pressing issues that is going unaddressed by the Province is that welfare rates have n't gone up in seven years . `` Until people have more money to spend on rent , this problem is going to persist , '' they say .
But Pedersen and Markle say there are measures the city could take if they wanted to stop the renovictions , displacement , and the growing homelessness problem . `` The main thing the city should do is buy the hotels at risk for renoviction and buy property for social housing , '' Pedersen says . That would ensure it was protected from developers who will simply build more condo developments or renovict tenants .
Jang says the City has been consistently asking the Province both to buy SROs in the DTES and turn them into government housing and to build low-income housing on the land the City donates to the Province . `` The City just does n't have the money to buy all these properties , '' Jang says . `` We buy land when we can and donate it to the Province so they can build on it , '' they say . `` But they need to commit to doing that . ''
Pedersen says that the City has control over licensing and that they could stop renovictions by refusing to give licenses to operate to new hotel owners and to their retail spaces . `` Even if they did that once or twice it would send a strong signal that SROs are not profitable , which would stop companies like Living Balance from purchasing them and converting them . ''
Markle adds that `` the City can stop renovictions right now by banning renovictions on renovations permits , '' Markle says . `` You do n't give a renovations permit to anyone unless they show that tenancy will be protected . ''
It 's clear Rouleau and Benkovich are n't the problem . But they are symptomatic of something larger—a particular group of people who see DTES residents as simply a problem to be solved or , better yet , erased from view and a government that prioritizes business over people . If Vancouver wants to cater only to those who can afford fancy meals and $ 500,000 faux-bohemian lofts , it 's certainly on the right path .

Gaver Nichols , an architect , is building a garage two feet from Paul and Patrice Linehan 's home . ( Patricia Sullivan/The Washington Post )
When architect Gaver Nichols designed three houses on a half-acre next to their home in Alexandria more than 20 years ago , they had a Utopian idea of “ shared visual green space ” — a physical manifestation of the camaraderie for which the Del Ray neighborhood is known .
It has n't worked out that way .
Over the years , owners of the three homes planted trees and shrubs , obstructing the view and carving semiprivate spaces out of the land .
Now Nichols is building a fence and a concrete-block garage about two feet from the property line of their neighbors , Paul and Patrice Linehan , blocking their kitchen window almost completely .
“ We 've gone from a more neighborly era to one of ‘ me-me-me , ' ” Nichols , 62 , said of the quartet of houses on East Monroe Avenue . “ I 'm creating on my property my own ‘ me ' space . I should n't have to modify my plan to meet their wishes . ”
In protest , friends of the Linehans have written posts on Facebook and launched a Change.org petition , calling on the city to halt the construction and make Nichols take the structures down . It is a far cry from the harmony and goodwill that residents of Del Ray say usually exists in their community of bungalows , rowhouses and , more recently , grander homes — a place so beloved that one resident 's musical ode , “ A Perfect Day in Del Ray , ” has become a minor hit on YouTube .
“ Our neighbors are coming to us asking , ‘ Can they do this ? ' ” said Patrice Linehan , 50 , who works for an educational nonprofit group . “ What we do n't know is , can he ? ”
[ Declaring war against thy neighbor over a house and shared driveway ]
Them allies have taken to calling the new garage and fence a modern-day version of the historic “ spite house ” that sits 20 blocks away in Old Town Alexandria . That structure , at 523 Queen St. , was built in 1830 by a frustrated John Hollensbury , who was so tired of horse-drawn wagon traffic and loiterers clogging the alley between their home and a neighbor 's that they enclosed the seven-foot-wide alley , creating what is reputedly the narrowest house in the nation .
History does n't record whether Hollensbury talked their frustrations through with their neighbors before building their spite house . Across town , Nichols has refused to talk with the Linehans — purportedly because the couple declined to take sides during an earlier dispute between Nichols and another neighbor .
The Linehans think Nichols also is miffed because they used a different architect in 2013 to make a major interior change in the house they designed and built , swapping the locations of their kitchen and dining room .
The day after the renovation was completed , the Linehans said , they were awakened at 7 a.m. by the banging of a hammer .
Nichols was building a six-foot fence on the property line .
The city 's Planning and Zoning Department , responding to the Linehans ' complaint , determined that the fence was really a two-panel trellis , which is permitted .
The portion of the structure that can be seen from the kitchen window is made of lattice , but — as the Linehans point out — there is nothing green growing on it . Beyond that section , the trellis reverts to a standard plank fence .

When Nichols notified neighbors last summer about the impending garage construction , the Linehans sent letters and called the city 's planning office . It took six months to schedule a meeting with two high-level staff members , and the couple says the city seems to be dragging its feet in addressing their protests .
“ We are not looking for favoritism , ” said Paul Linehan , 55 , a federal employee . “ We just want the city to be open , transparent and fair . ”
[ A beloved Fairfax mayor 's secret life , exposed ]
Planning and Zoning Director Karl Moritz said that Nichols began building the garage in July , with all the legally required permits . Now , however , their office is reviewing whether the building permit was properly granted . Last week , the attorney for the Linehans sent a letter to the city saying the construction illegally deprives their clients of air and light .
“ The vast majority of folks in Alexandria are good neighbors and work out differences with each other , ” Moritz said . “ But it 's a challenge in a city of small lots , when your neighbor 's quality of life depends on what you do on your property . ”
Nichols says they converted their existing garage , which is behind and separate from their large home at 319 East Monroe , into a home office years ago . Under local law , they are not allowed to have clients there , but the Linehans say they do .
They point to pictures of people with architectural plans coming and going , captured by a security camera they put on the outside of their home . Nichols objects , saying that the Linehans have put them under surveillance on their own property .

Between 2007 and 2009 , Nichols served on a city task force that rewrote some of the city 's zoning laws — including a reduction , from 8 feet to 1 foot , in the setback from the property line required for garages .
They boast that they know zoning and building permits rules inside out and says they have noticed a PVC pipe that emerges from the side of the Linehans ' house ( the Linehans say it 's a furnace exhaust duct Nichols placed there when they designed and built the residence ) .
“ Mr . Linehan better watch it , ” Nichols said . “ Because as soon as I go to the state , saying [ he 's ] violating the fire code , he 's going to have a lot of other trouble . ”
Nichols said he 's moving their business from the converted garage to Baltimore . They plan to double the size of the Del Ray structure and turn it into a living space , with a patio and garden in front .
The adjacent new garage , they said , will have beautiful stone facing and be the marvel of the neighborhood . He 's already built a soil berm between their yard and the Linehans ' and planted crape myrtle trees , disrupting what remained of the “ shared visual green space . ”
“ I do plan to probably put a fence up next , ” Nichols said .
The Linehans do n't have that option . Their home , and the other two designed by Nichols , have deed restrictions that prohibit fences .
For those who would genuinely like to know how atheists can have morals , I 'd like to attempt to offer my best explanation . I 'm no career philosopher or ethicist , so I 'm sure this could be done better by someone else ( like Dan Fincke of Camels with Hammers ) , but I 'll give it my best shot . One problem is that the term “ atheist ” is n't descriptive enough because all that signifies is what you do n't believe , but it does n't say anything about what you do believe . Among non-believers-in-gods you will find both naturalists and supernaturalists , conspiracy theorists and skeptics , neo-pagans and new age spiritualists , and everything in between . The variety is endless . I could n't possibly address how all of them think ( nor would I care to ) , but I will address how most atheists I know would answer this question . Most of my skeptical friends and acquaintances are philosophical naturalists , which means they do n't see any valid reasons for believing in supernatural things ( ghosts , goblins , demons , magic , fairies , spirits or gods ) . They see the natural world as reality and everything else as make-believe . How can such people live moral lives without some transcendent Being telling them what to do ?
First you must be clear about which question you 're really asking . Are you asking , “ Do non-theists live moral lives ? ” because if you are , the simple answer is “ Yes. ” Non-theists live lives just as guided by moral principle as theists , even though the two sets of principles often do n't agree with each other . For example , while much of Christian moral teaching stresses comparatively narrow definitions of “ proper ” sexuality ( married heteros only ! ) , non-religious thinking on the same subject begins in a different place and therefore arrives at different definitions of acceptable sexuality . But both systems of thought condemn exploitative sex or sex that brings harm to another ( e.g . pedophilia , rape ) . Both will stress the importance of mutual respect within intimate relationships and both will value honesty and condemn deceit . I know this because I 've discussed these things with more people from both camps than I could possibly count and the same underlying values are clearly there . The same similarities could be demonstrated for pretty much any other topic we could discuss , even when the particular outworkings vary .
Furthermore , if you will listen to what naturalists have to say about those values ( especially the humanists among them ) , you will often hear great passion for those principles saturating their speech , and you will see it in their eyes , too . They care a great deal about their moral values , and nothing insults them more than to be told they do n't have any simply because someone else disagrees about the what those values should be . This is bigotry , plain and simple . If the critics of skepticism would only learn to listen with mutual respect , they will see that what separates their moral values is n't as great as what unites them . I 'm disappointed to say the failure to show respect happens on both sides of this ideological divide so that neither is above reproach . But you can disagree without insulting people 's character . We need more role models on both sides demonstrating how this is done .
Once you can accept that atheists do have morals , and that they already live moral lives ( even if the particulars do n't match your own ) , the next questions are “ How ? ” and “ Why ? ” The answers to those questions could easily fill books but the essence of the answer is refreshingly simple : The basis of all human moral reasoning is empathy , and empathy is a natural product of our biological evolution . When a species takes care of its own , it thrives ; when it does not , it fails and dies away . Imagine two groups of animals , one hunting and sleeping and grooming in groups and the other riding solo , living as loners . Which group will survive and thrive and live to pass its genes to the next generation ? The ones who take care of their own will fare better , and years down the road their kind will be the only ones around . Apply the same concept to the long history of hominid development and you 'll find that solidarity—identifying with one another—lies at the heart of our evolutionary survival . That 's why virtually all major philosophies and religions throughout human history ( including those predating the Abrahamic religions by many centuries ) have expressed some form of the golden rule : treat others how you want to be treated . All moral reasoning starts here , and humans share this value regardless of creed . Atheists and Fundamentalists alike believe in caring for one another , even if how they work that out varies wildly .
Humans are n't the only species which exhibits empathy and altruism , though . Most members of the animal kingdom will protect their young even to the point of self-sacrifice , and most will look out for the other members of their group . But many animals have even displayed empathy and altruistic behavior towards members of species besides their own . Dolphins have been known to protect swimmers from nearby sharks and a beluga whale was once observed helping a swimmer when their legs cramped up at a theme park in China . Well-controlled experiments and observations of many kinds have demonstrated that many animals—especially the closer they come to our own species ( e.g . primates ) —show a clear sense of fairness , equality , sharing and cooperation ( I 'd recommend The Bonobo and the Atheist by de Waal for a thorough investigation of this ) . Rats will help each other out of cages when there 's nothing in it for them personally , even if it means giving up a reward like chocolate . What this tells us is that empathy and morality are n't products of religion ; if anything , the reverse may be true . It may very well be that our biologically ingrained sense of “ do this but do n't do that ” gave rise to , or at least reinforced , the many systems of belief in invisible spirits watching over us to ensure we are doing what we 're supposed to do .
Think about how readily parents picked up the practice of telling their children that somehow Santa Claus “ sees you when you 're sleeping , [ and ] knows when you 're awake. ” Those of us who perpetuate this untruth know this is a lie but we keep doing it anyway because it works . Not infallibly , of course , but it does help keep the kids in line while also sprinkling a season with a bit of magic and wonder . Ironically the song goes on to say they should “ be good for goodness ' sake , ” but then we turn around and promise them they will get things in return for being good . For children , that 's a much more powerful motivator . Santa 's virtual invisibility only makes them more powerful both because now they can be somehow anywhere and everywhere at once , and because you can not disprove a being you ca n't even see . Clearly we are not above fabricating stories that are untrue in order to elicit the desired behaviors from our children . Have you ever heard a parent tell a child at a restaurant to watch out for the manager because they can see how they 're behaving ? What exactly is the child supposed to think the restaurant manager will do to him ? It 's never really specified , but the feeling of dread it produces seems to be its own justification . We will use whatever works . That , I believe , explains how religious belief began .
But grown-ups put these childish fables away , right ? I mean , once you 're grown you should have internalized your codes of conduct so that you will essentially follow them even after you 've learned that Santa is make-believe and that the restaurant manager is n't going to beat you for talking too loudly at the dinner table , right ? Well , sort of . Most will agree that once you reach a certain age these threats become silly and inappropriate . But even as grown-ups we are still being told that an invisible Person is watching us while we 're sleeping and while we 're awake , and that they will punish us for our bad deeds and reward us for the good ones after we die . What , after all , are Heaven and Hell if not Christmas morning taken to the extreme ? Many would argue that we must always keep this story around because without it people will go crazy . They will all become addicted to porn and begin raping and murdering and stealing from nursing homes . I think that 's nonsense .. Even when they fail to follow this instinct , most normal people are still driven by it most of the time . Dropping the Giant Invisible Man story wo n't reverse that any more than removing training wheels will make a prepared child unable to ride a bike . There comes a time when you “ put childish things away ” as one guy once said ; )
So is this morality , this “ goodness , ” rooted in something transcendent and objective ? Is it wired into the universe ? Yes and no . Empathy is woven into the fabric of our psychology by natural selection but we also build on that and make the world we want to live in . Like most traits of the animal kingdom , humans like to take things to a wholly different level . Birds sing songs while humans compose symphonies . Beavers build stick huts while people build skyscrapers . Dolphins carry one another for days if they 're injured while people organize international relief efforts when a typhoon hits a region on the opposite side of the planet . We like to use our developed cerebral cortexes to devise highly complex systems to accomplish the same things our animal cousins already do , only much bigger . And while other animals situate themselves into primal hierarchies of leadership , complete with their own well-established rules , we develop legal societies and civilizations in which human capacities and resources can be optimally distributed for the good of our own species ( and hopefully one day for the rest of our ecosystem , on which we interdepend ) .
We create human society , with its complex systems of rules and ethics . It is a social construct , and its particulars will vary from place to place and from time to time . The systems of morality we construct within those societies and cultures are our own inventions , and they are intended to arrange our lives the way we want them . We like sleeping in our own beds , safe in houses not in danger of armed thieves , so we invent laws and law enforcement . These are human inventions but they accomplish what we want to accomplish for ourselves , so we keep doing it . We are n't doing it because of a divine design ; we do it because we want to do it in order to make our world a better place as we see it . We would rather not fear being eaten by other animals so we arrange our lives in such a way that this becomes less and less of a possibility . So on the one hand , our highly developed sense of morals is subjective because we are in fact the creators of these systems . But on the other hand , they are rooted in the most basic instinct , which is the survival of our own species , and that is wired into us by millions of years of natural selection .
Despite its many flaws , we could look at the American system of government as one of the first and longest-lasting social experiments in which a system of laws was devised without reference to one religion or another ( in fact , it expressly forbids the intermingling of the two ) . The U.S. Constitution does n't mention any gods at all * because it 's not predicated upon any religion , despite what many today would have us believe . It has survived for more than two centuries even though it is secular by design . The reason this worked is that after thousands of years of formation , human moral reasoning had finally reached the point at which it no longer required fear of the gods in order to bolster an ethical system . It was time for the training wheels to come off , so they did . That can be a scary thing , just like riding a bike for the first time . People accustomed to the familiar supports of religion still fight the notion of a secular society , insisting it can not work . Yet here we are , still functioning under the framework of laws scribbled down more than 200 years earlier . That says an awful lot .
We do n't need the gods in order to be moral . Our moral instincts predate the invention of religion by millions of years , and they will move forward from this point on without the assistance of religion in the foreseeable future . It 's time to put away childish things . It 's time we grew up .

You do n't need market researchers or sales data to tell you that Iron Horse Brewery 's Irish Death is one of the most popular craft beers around here . In 2011 , the Washington State Legislature passed a bill requiring every Irish bar in Washington to have it on tap . I 'm kidding , of course . Right ? Every since the early days of Iron Horse Brewery , when the late Jim Quilter was the owner/brewmaster , Irish Death has always captured a lot of attention .
The brewery just announced that it intends to start packaging Quilter 's Irish Death in 12-ounce cans . The beer is currently only available in 22-ounce bottles and 15.5-gallon cans , sometimes referred to as kegs . Six packs of 12-ounce cans should hit the shelves in the spring of 2016 .
“ If you know about Irish Death and you are reading this , you 're reaction to the news is probably , what the hell have you been waiting for Iron Horse ? ” said Owner and General manager Greg Parker . “ If you do n't know about Irish Death , you are probably trying to figure out why putting a beer in a can is news . To both of those ponderings , I do n't have a good answer . To change the subject back to what I was talking about ; Irish Death is going into 12 oz cans . ”
“ When I found out we were releasing Irish Death in cans I threw up with excitement , ” said Ross Chalstrom , who we like to refer to as Cowboy Ross . “ My hands are petite and my grip is n't the strongest so the cans make getting Irish Death to my mouth easier . ”

Japan may have called off its annual Antarctic whale hunt in deference to a ruling from the U.N. 's International Court of Justice , but the country 's whaling industry has yet to give up the fight .
As a show of defiance , hundreds Japanese officials , politicians and other pro-whaling allies gathered Tuesday for a buffet featuring , what else , whale . According to the Associated Press , the group feasted on `` Cutlets , sashimi , steak and other dishes made of whale meat '' and shouted a one-word toast : `` Whale ! ''

Meanwhile , Al Jazeera reports , a Japanese parliamentary committee unanimously passed a resolution calling on the government to fully investigate its options , saying that the court 's decision was `` truly regrettable '' but `` does not necessarily prevent Japan 's whaling , which is a unique tradition and culture . '' Among Japanese consumers , the AP notes , whale meat has been declining in popularity .
An international moratorium on commercial whaling has been in place since 1987 ; Japan , until now , has skirted regulations by continuing to hunt the animals under the pretenses of scientific research . The court ruling found that the country 's “ killing , taking and treating of whales '' was `` not driven by strictly scientific consideration . '' Japan has yet to call off two other whaling programs : one along its northern coast and another in the northern Pacific , in which it usually kills about 300 minke whales each year .
The Palmpilot was probably the first commercially available gadget that let you transfer vCards over thin air . It used Infrared , and later Bluetooth , to transfer information from device to device . Most people who owned a Palm device tried it at least once , for the cool factor , but the process was awkward and slow so it never really took off .
Since then however there have been many declarations of ‘ the death of the business card ! ' . I 'm pretty sure even this blog wrote similar posts in the past . Every 6 months another company launches that seems to promise to ‘ revolutionize ' the business card business . Still , most people I know still carry around lots of paper and I do n't see that changing very soon .
Why ?
There are a couple of good reasons for that too . Let me sum it up for you real quick so the next time someone tells you that one day we wo n't need paper anymore and that it is cool to have a shotcode on your businesscard or some other seemingly futuristic idea you can explain to them how that is n't going to happen .
First of all most business card revolutionaries are n't revolutionary enough . Simply converting the business card to a digital format is n't going to cut it . The reason why that is is because there is more to it than just exchanging information . That is the basic error most people make . Or at least it is about more than exchanging the information printed on the card !
The whole ‘ exchanging business cards ' process is a cultural phenomenon that contains a few subtle meta layers of information that you ca n't just digitize . Sure , a digitally exchanged business card can contain a date and GPS coordinates . That 's cool , but not cool enough .
Imagine being in an airport ; you sit down somewhere , drop your wallet , the guy next to you picks it up and hands it to you , you look at each other and you realize its Bill Gates . Hot damn ! You thank him , they ask you where you are going , you start talking , pitch your company and at a certain point they say “ That sounds awesome , give me your card so I can have my people contact your people ” .
Now you have two options : you can reach into your jacket pocket ( 0,2 seconds ) , grab a card ( 0,05 seconds ) and hand it over , with the text on the card facing them ( 0,25 seconds ) . This whole process should n't take more than a second , it wo n't distract you from the conversation and it wo n't require any action from Bill except sticking out their hand , an action which Bill is familiar with .
Then the magic happens ; Bill looks at the card . They examine the quality of the paper between their thumb and index finger . They glance over the beautifully designed company logo and then reads your title , or the lack of one , and without effort or even being conscious about it they will form an opinion on you and make a mental note which will make them remember your name . Then they take out their pen and quickly scribbles 2 words at the back of your card .
What happens next ? Nothing . Bill Gates does n't give you their card . That is not their style and that is not how things work when you meet Bill . People introduce themselves to Bill , Bill does n't have to introduce themselves to people . People give Bill business cards , Bill does n't hand out cards . If there will ever be a meeting again between you and Bill the initiative will come from Bill .
The other option ?
Well , there really is n't one . You can reach for your iPhone , Android ( seriously , in front of Bill ? ) or Windows Phone and launch any of the current Business card replacement apps and ask Bill to do the same . But seriously , are you going to waste precious minutes trying to convince Bill to install an app so you can exchange business cards ? No way in hell . Bill does n't exchange anything ! You 've got 30 seconds to make a lasting impression and you wo n't do it by staring at your phone trying to find the LinkedIn app and then asking Bill to dictate you their email address .
This is all so obvious I 'm surprised I still have to explain it to people . As long as the digital business card exchange format is n't a lot richer , unless you can do it without looking at your phone , unless you can do it one way and unless you are pretty sure it is compatible with almost everybody in the world , this is n't going to work out . Paper business cards are here to stay .
Tips for digital enhancements
Of course , there are exceptions and easy ways to enhance the whole information exchange process . A few tips :
– My personal business card contains just my name and email address , nothing more . If a contact is worth following up on all you basically need is those two pieces of information . In fact , you can also learn the company name and website from looking at the email address so that makes it 4 pieces of information with just 2 information sets . And the less information on the card the bigger the chance that people will take the trouble to follow up .
– Keep your card readable and easy to scan . A lot of people use scanners or phone cameras and Apps with character recognition to input data . Using weird fonts and combined horizontal and vertical text placement does n't make it easier to read .
– Shotcodes are cute but hardly anyone can read them . Use for innovativeness ( not a word but you know what I mean ) but not for usefulness , yet .
Apps that are useful
Then there are a few apps that are cool and useful . Lets look at three of them :
I often use Business Card reader to quickly scan business cards as soon as I get them . Sometimes I 'll scan the card while we are talking and then hand it back after I scanned it so they can re-use it .
Be careful not to appear unthankful or uninterested and make sure to mention you have all their data copied to your phone now .
The other service I regularly use is Cardcloud . I do n't often bring my paper business cards to meetings ( because I 'm like Bill Gates , right ? ) and love how their app focusses on sharing your card instead of the whole information exchange dance . If the other person has Cardcloud too you can beam the card to the other person , and Cardcloud scans
your location for other people using the app , but I mainly use it as an easy way to share my contact details , if I want to . And that makes all the difference .
I will be talking to 20 people at an event and they will likely all give me their card . They do n't ask me if I want one , they just give it to me . Maybe with 1 or 2 of those I will feel like also sharing my data with them . In those cases I will ask for their card or email address and enter it directly into the Cardcloud app . Then I can choose if I email them my personal card or my business card .
Then there is CardFlick . It is trying to recreate the experience of seeing a beautifully designed card . It might be too early to tell if the app will turn into something that will replace or enhance your paper card as I found the process of sharing the cards inconvenient and the choice of designs limited .
Still , at least they are trying to add some feeling and beauty to the scene and for that I 'm thankful .
Conclusion
The focus for many ‘ business card killers ' is too much on replacing paper business cards with a digital equivalent . The opportunity lies much more with enhancing analog meetings ; annotating , adding notes , recording locations and adding other meta layers could be useful . But there really is n't a need to kill anything , especially as it is performing so well .
There is still a future for paper business cards but I do see digital information exchange apps becoming more popular and growing alongside paper .
But complete replace paper ? Well , do n't hold your breath…

It 's a small step , but a step in the right direction .
The German government 's drugs commissioner , Marlene Mortler , wants health insurance companies to cover the costs of cannabis for medicinal purposes for people who are seriously ill .
`` More people should have access to medicinal cannabis , '' said Mortler in an interview with the daily newspaper `` Die Welt . ''
They are responding to a growing sentiment among the public .
In the Autumn of 2014 , a study conducted by the German Hemp Association ( Deutscher Hanfverband ) and the pollsters , Infratest dimap , showed 80 percent of respondents think it should be easier for patients to access cannabis .
The same survey also suggested the majority of Germans oppose the worldwide war on drugs . Just one in five of the respondents considers the aggressive approach taken by national governments successful .
The front of prohibition is crumbling
The United Nations ' convention on illicit substances forms the basis of the worldwide ban on drugs . Its signatories include 184 nations which have committed themselves to allowing cannabis exclusively for medicinal or scientific purposes .
But worldwide , this front of prohibition is crumbling .
Uruguay became the first nation to fully legalize cannabis - from its cultivation to its consumption .
Other Latin American countries are keeping a keen eye on this experiment in Uruguay . Chile , for instance , is one where it 's now possible to grow medicinal marijuana .
Columbia 's president , Juan Manuel Santos , is convinced the repressive tactics of old have failed . Their Ecuadorian counterpart is of the same opinion .
And in Mexico , the war on drugs has sparked violence similar to that of a civil war . Since 2006 , 100,000 people have fallen victim to the drug wars .
Even in the USA , which for years has been the main driver of this expensive and ineffective policy , things are changing irrevocably .
About 18 million US residents live in federal states where marijuana is fully legal . And that with interesting side effects . In Colorado , tax revenue from the legal sale of cannabis was 30 percent higher than tax revenue from alcohol sales .
Meanwhile , large investment companies are setting aside risk capital for the marijuana industry . One such investor is Peter Thiel , a co-founder of PayPal , and one of the first to invest in Facebook and Spotify .
Demand and supply are stable
After decades of repression it 's getting clearer and clearer that the war on drugs has failed .
It has failed to reduce supply and it has failed to reduce demand .
Instead , it has managed to beef up organized crime .
And it has criminalized millions of users .
Among under-25s in Germany alone , it is estimated half have some experience with cannabis . It is estimated that between three and seven million people in Germany use drugs regularly . Why these people should live with one foot in prison is now beyond any reasonable explanation .
More than half of the country 's law professors believe the narcotics act to be unconstitutional .
Aside from these professors , ever more addiction experts , doctors and , yes , even police believe criminal law to be the wrong means for dealing with drugs and drug abuse .
And slowly this is trickling down to the policians .
Cannabis is by no means harmless - it 's the same as other drugs , including the socially accepted alcohol .
But the ideal of a drugs-free society is an illusion . It 's impossible to push it through with the law , even in prisons .
If , however , you ca n't stop the drugs market , then you have to regulate it and tax it - and do what you can to reduce the risks .
Both the current trend and common sense point this way .
Marlene Mortler will have to get moving .
Not that we have n't gotten used to this already , but the Galaxy will probably have to put out a makeshift lineup on the road vs. Real Salt Lake .
Kevin Baxter is reporting from training that neither Giovani dos Santos nor Gyasi Zardes are practicing with the squad today , making it unlikely the attacking duo will travel with the team this weekend .
Gio dos Santos , Gyasi Zardes not training with # LAGalaxy today . Likely wo n't make trip to Colorado — Kevin Baxter ( @ kbaxter11 ) March 16 , 2017
Oops . Make that RSL Zardes and Gio wo n't be going to Utah with # LAGalaxy . Sorry bout that — Kevin Baxter ( @ kbaxter11 ) March 16 , 2017
It 's not the worst news in the world . Our mantra from the beginning of the season has been one of patience : This 2017 Galaxy team needs time : For players to recover from injury , for chemistry to develop , for an offensive identity to take shape .
There 's no real pressing need to rush their most potent attacking weapons back from injury , even if it has a negative short-term impact on results .
In the meantime , the LA Galaxy have a tough matchup ahead of them this Saturday . ( Mar 18th , 6:30 pm , Spectrum Sportsnet )
“ Game of Thrones ” actor Finn Jones will play the titular role in Marvel and Netflix 's upcoming superhero series “ Iron Fist , ” Variety has confirmed .
He 'll star as Daniel “ Danny ” Rand , a handsome , sophisticated and independent loner who returns to New York City after being missing for years to fight against the criminal element corrupting the city with their incredible kung-fu mastery and the ability to summon the power of the fiery Iron Fist . The series is the fourth collaboration between Marvel and Netflix , following “ Daredevil , ” “ Jessica Jones ” and the upcoming “ Luke Cage. ” All four characters are known as Marvel 's “ street-level ” heroes , who — following the launch of their solo series — will team up to form “ The Defenders ” in a crossover miniseries event on the streaming service .
Update , 3/17 : Marvel and Netflix have officially confirmed Jones ' casting .
“ Danny Rand is a very complicated character . He 's a billionaire New York Buddhist monk martial arts superhero who 's still trying to figure out what exactly that all means , ” said executive producer and showrunner Scott Buck . “ Finn is able to play all these levels in such an honest , revelatory way that as soon as I saw them I knew they were our Danny . ”

“ Finn wonderfully blends confidence with vulnerability , making them the perfect choice as they struggle to find their place in the world , ” said exec producer and head of Marvel TV Jeph Loeb . “ Now that we 've found our Danny Rand , we 've completed our principal cast for the upcoming ‘ Defenders ' on Netflix and we are thrilled to continue to show audiences unexplored corners of the Marvel Universe . ”
A former executive producer on “ Dexter , ” Buck was named as showrunner for “ Iron Fist ” back in December .
“ Scott came in with a take on Iron Fist that quite simply knocked us off our feet , ” said Marvel 's head of TV , Jeph Loeb , who will also serve as an exec producer on the series with Buck . “ We always look for the most creative minds in the field to help us bring our heroes to life , and with Scott we 've found someone that can deliver yet another great series in the ongoing story of ‘ The Defenders . ' ”
Buck added , “ I 've always been drawn to writing complex , intriguing characters , and that 's what most excites me about the opportunity to bring Danny Rand and ‘ Iron Fist ' to life with Marvel on Netflix . ”
Jones is best known for playing Ser Loras Tyrell , brother to Natalie Dormer 's Margaery , on HBO 's hit fantasy series . He 's repped by APA , NB Management and Curtis Brown in the U.K .
Rumors of Jones ' casting were first reported by That Hashtag Show , and later confirmed by EW .

This fine woodblock print was lovingly designed by Jed Henry , and hand-printed in David Bull 's Tokyo workshop . The materials and techniques used are authentic to those used centuries ago in old Edo .
This particular design requires over 16 individual impressions to achieve a full range of color . David uses the finest quality of yamazakura ( mountain cherry ) to carve their printing blocks . The wood is capable of holding a very fine level of delicacy – every last detail is printed by the wood left standing , after the rest has been cut away .
The paper is handmade Echizen Hosho Washi , made by national living treasure , Iwano Ichibei IX . This is the exact same paper printers used over 200 years ago ! You can see a video of Mr. Iwano at work here .
The top cartouche phonetically reads `` Ma-ri-o '' , and the bottom cartouche means `` Beloved friends , dear rivals '' .
This print is the traditional koban format – 7 x 9 inches ( 17.5 x 23 cm ) .
After the inauguration of Donald Trump , media attention will be fixed on their first steps towards Russia . A lot has been said already about the difficult choice Trump faces after the hacking scandal : on the one hand , they promised voters they will improve relations with Moscow ; on the other , any overture towards the Kremlin will be interpreted as a confirmation of the rumours about the alleged influence Russian President Vladimir Putin has over him . But little has been said about the dilemma that Putin themselves faces , and that one is even more difficult .
On the one side , Trump 's victory was an unexpected gift for the Kremlin , and it seems no one is trying to hide the fact . Russian state media are going out of their way to compliment the newly elected US president and smear their opponents .
For example , Russia 's Channel One news reports portray Trump as a defender of the working class , who is harassed by deceitful media and attacked by paid demonstrators , and who will finally rescind an `` unpopular '' healthcare reform and defend the country against migrants . In other words , the Kremlin 's propaganda defends the US president with such dedication , as if they were the Russian president .
One can understand why this is so . After all , many painful political issues are at stake . The main one is , of course , the repeal of the sanctions , which are harming not so much the Russian economy , as individuals in Putin 's closest circle .
Another important issues is Ukraine . The Kremlin hopes to have Crimea recognised as Russian territory and not to have any weapon systems installed on Ukrainian territory . Of course , there are also expectations about the resolution of the Syrian question : Moscow hopes that Trump 's administration wo n't demand that Assad steps down .
The Kremlin is happy about Trump 's statements on NATO and it hopes that its expansion will stop and military deployment close to Russian borders will be curbed .
But there is another side to this coin : Trump 's presidential victory could be a headache for Vladimir Putin as well .
The past 10 years , and especially since 2014 , all internal Russian propaganda has been built on the concept of the external enemy - the West led by the US . The whole world believes that Russia is fighting in the Donbass region against Ukraine , but Russian media says Russia is fighting in Ukraine against the US . The whole world thinks that in Syria , Russia is defending Bashar al-Assad . But Russian media reports that in Syria Russia is resisting Washington 's attempt to spread chaos through the armed groups it controls .
Looking for a new villain
The US is the answer to all painful questions . If the opposition in Russia organises marches , of course , it is the US which wants to destabilise Russia by paying activists to protests .
An economic crisis in the country ? No , the problem is not corruption and ineffective governance , it is Western sanctions ! And if a law banning `` homosexuality propaganda '' is being voted on , then that is justified with protecting society from the `` corrupting influence of the West '' .
In fact , there is not one problem which the sharp-tongued Russian TV hosts can not link to the US . For example , if you get detained without any reason , even beaten up in the police station , you would n't blame it on Washington . But it can always be pointed out that after all , in America the police would shoot you on the spot for even the slightest resistance .
OPINION : America was a 'stan ' long before Trump
It may be possible to avoid this difficult situation by switching attention to other Western countries . To a certain extent , this has already happened : if 10 years ago , the attitude of Russians towards Europe was positive overall , today it is much more negative - even if Europe still fairs better than the US . State TV channels portray Europe as sinking in an economic crisis , suffering under the oppression of migrants , who invade the rights of citizens and promote debauchery - the Kremlin 's media love to use the word `` Gayropa '' on these occasions .
In any case , Europe will not fit into the role of the new enemy . That is because this same propaganda regime was portraying Europe as a helpless and weak-willed marionette of the US . Then , of course , there needs to be another political figure embodying this enemy . Russians used to decorate their car bumpers with stickers insulting Obama . Who is going take their place ? Angela Merkel ? Theresa May ? No , it wo n't work .
There is also another reason for Europe not fitting into the role of enemy No 1 . The European Union is not really a state , but a group of counties which have different relations with the Kremlin . In the Czech Republic , Serbia , Hungary , Moldova and Bulgaria , Moscow has found some understanding . Relations with Italy are not that bad either . In Austria `` our '' candidate lost , but in France there will be two loyal candidates for the presidential elections - Marine Le Pen and Francois Fillon . And in Germany , there is space to challenge Merkel . In other words , the way Moscow sees it - not all is lost in Europe , and it is too early to demonise it .
'Nigeria with snow '
The US is Russia 's perfect enemy because the Cold War `` feud '' made Russia in the eyes of its citizens as equally powerful as the US . After all , anti-American propaganda is not a Putin invention ; it was a cornerstone of Soviet ideology . The rhetoric of anti-American slogans today is cut-and-pasted from Soviet propaganda . Having Russians remember an era when their country was a superpower competing with the US is very convenient for Putin as the Russian economy has shrunk to only 1.7 percent of the world 's , and loyal allies willing to recognise Crimea as Russian territory are difficult to come by .
Without a conflict with the US , Russia would lose its power status and recede to the poor outskirts of Europe , a `` Nigeria with snow '' , as Sergey Brin , the Moscow-born founder of Google , once described it .
In other words , while the Putin-Trump honeymoon may have been enjoyable , present circumstances are pressing for the break-up of this union . Just as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie 's perfect Brangelina union hit the rocks , so Trumputin is destined to end . But this will be to the benefit and relief of both sides . Sooner or later , Trump will start talking about corruption and dictatorship in Russia , while Putin 's media will soon discover that Trump is a Wall Street `` insider '' , a swindler and overall an illegitimate president who won fewer votes than Hillary Clinton .
It 's possible this will not happen immediately . Trump will justify the revoking of the sanctions with the opportunity to get Russia to downsize its nuclear arsenal - a quite convenient for Russia , which ca n't afford to maintain a huge arsenal in times of economic crisis . Moscow , itself , hinted at this to Trump so lifting sanctions does n't look like a one-sided concession .
It is clear that both sides will continue to make overtures for a while . After all this is reminiscent of George Bush , who looked into Putin 's eyes and `` got a sense of their soul '' , and Obama , who was trying to `` restart '' relations . In both cases love only lasted a short while .
Sooner or later , the lovers will be forced to realise that they are more Montague and Capulet than Romeo and Juliet .

CLOSE UK head coach Mark Stoops updates Drew Barker 's health , QB depth chart before South Carolina game . Jon Hale/The C-J

LEXINGTON , Ky. – UK head coach Mark Stoops is still uncertain if quarterback Drew Barker will be available for the Wildcats ' game against South Carolina , but Barker remains the Wildcats ' No . 1 quarterback .
“ We 'll see how the week goes on . I 'm in no position to talk about that right now , ” Stoops said Monday . “ He had an MRI . He 's gon na consult with our doctors and some specialists , and we 'll get to the bottom of it and see what 's best for him . ”
Later Monday on their weekly radio show , Stoops said it would take a `` miraculous recovery '' for Barker to be back at practice Wednesday and ready to start the game against South Carolina .
Stoops said Barker had been dealing with “ a few issues ” with their back during the summer , and while a hit on the first series of a 62-42 win over New Mexico State forced them to the sideline some of the issue may be “ chronic . ”
“ He 's had some issues that were lingering , so it 's not just one hit , ” Stoops said . “ So if you look at the hit it does n't look anything too much , but I think you put that and compound it on some of the back problems that he 's had , even going back to last week at Florida . ”
Junior quarterback Stephen Johnson will likely play against South Carolina regardless of Barker 's health , Stoops said , but they decided to list Barker as the starter on the depth chart “ for a reason . ”
Barker has completed 18 of 36 passes for 334 yards , four touchdowns and five interceptions in three games this season . Almost all their production came in the first half of the season opener against Southern Mississippi . They are 7-for-17 for 47 yards and four interceptions since .
Johnson has completed 18 of 25 passes for 355 yards and three touchdowns in two games . They also have netted 60 rushing yards on 17 carries . In relief of Barker against New Mexico State , Johnson completed 17 of 22 passes for 310 yards and three touchdowns .
Stoops would not speculate on their decision-making process about the starting quarterback if Barker returns to full health and Johnson continues to play well .
“ It 's hard to talk about hypotheticals right now , ” Stoops said . “ I have no idea how healthy Drew 's gon na be and what he 's gon na look like this week . I was just asked if I anticipate Stephen playing and the answer is yes , I do . To what extent , I do n't know . ”
More UK coverage :
Johnson gained 51 yards on 10 carries against New Mexico State and adds an extra dimension to the offense with their running ability , especially if Barker is limited moving forward by their back problems .
“ There 's no doubt it helps , ” Stoops said . “ Even if it 's just somebody on the backside just lingering around a little more , then you can get a few more yards sometimes . ”
Stoops does not expect Kentucky 's offense to change dramatically based on which quarterback is in the game .
They did acknowledge that the coaches would probably call fewer quarterback runs to help accommodate Barker 's back , but otherwise what parts of the offense would be featured each will mostly depend on the opposing defense .
UK offensive coordinator Eddie Gran expressed full confidence in Johnson 's ability to run the entire offense after the New Mexico State win .
“ Our second-team guy has got to be able to run our offense , ” Gran said . “ Everything that we 're asking Drew to do they can do . ”
With Barker hurt , Stoops did instruct Gran to remove Johnson 's option to run late in the game against New Mexico State .
Johnson , who is listed at 6-foot-2 , 183 pounds on the roster , was met by several hard hits around the goal line against New Mexico State and appeared to be taken down by a horse-collar tackle at one point in the second quarter but officials declined to throw a flag on the play – “ I 'm sure it was a legal play , though , ” Stoops said with a sarcastic smile Monday . “ I do n't even have to send it in ( to the league ) . ”
With Barker 's status uncertain , Stoops admitted the staff has to be aware of the need for Johnson to protect their body .
“ But we have to play it , ” Stoops said . “ We have to win , we have to play . We have to do whatever gives us the best opportunity to win football games . … Ever heard the saying scared money never wins ? So same thing here . ”
Cincinnati transfer Luke Wright – a walk-on who was granted immediately eligibility after following Gran and quarterbacks coach Darin Hinshaw from Cincinnati to UK – made their debut late in the win as the Wildcats ' No . 3 quarterback . Freshman quarterback Gunnar Hoak will also receive reps in practice this week in case they are forced into action , Stoops said .
While the quarterback position faces no shortage of questions heading into the South Carolina game , Stoops and the team at least have the impressive performance by Johnson to build on .
“ After that first possession they really settled in and played an exceptional game , really , ” Stoops said . “ He made good decisions . They were very poised . They were accurate on the deep ball . ”

Shocking no one , President Trump is expected to nominate a right-wing radio host with no experience in agricultural research to run the research division of the Department of Agriculture , according to a report from ProPublica .
Clovis , a devout Trump supporter , is known in Iowa for their conservative radio show `` Impact with Sam Clovis '' on Sioux City KSCJ . During the 2016 presidential election , they became a confidant of the Trump campaign , advising the candidate on agricultural issues . Clovis was also allegedly responsible for bringing in foreign policy adviser Carter Page , who is currently at the center of the Russia election interference scandal .

While Clovis has a doctorate in public administration from the University of Alabama , they have never taken a graduate course in science , ProPublica reported , which might explain why they are a notorious climate change denier who insists there is insufficient evidence proving global warming .
When articulating Trump 's position on climate change in an interview , they said , “ Once we get more science , we are going to make decisions , ” ProPublica reported . In a 2014 interview , Clovis said global warming `` is simply a mechanism for transferring wealth from one group of people to another , '' New York Daily News reported .
After Trump won the election , Clovis nabbed an influential role in the transition , overseeing the Department of Agriculture to ensure the president-elect 's new policies would be properly implemented . But their background in no way suggests that they are qualified to be the Department of Agriculture 's chief scientist .
Under the 2008 Farm Bill , according to ProPublica , the agency 's “ chief scientist ” is to be chosen “ from among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research , education , and economics . ”
ProPublica 's reporting yielded no scientific papers . Their 2006 dissertation was on homeland security preparation .
The deconstruction of the administration state continues .
German electronics firm Bosch says it will have a solid state battery on the market by 2020 that will double the range of electric cars at half the cost of today 's batteries .
Today the cheapest electric cars , which cost around $ 30,000 , typically have a range of less than 100 miles .
Once commercialised , this new battery could give affordable electric cars a range of over 200 miles per charge – and at a lower price .
The acceleration in the development of this new battery comes with Bosch 's acquisition of Californian startup Seeo , which already has sample cells of this battery .
According to Seeo , they have come up with a new way to make lithium batteries without a liquid electrolyte . The batteries need no cooling system and wo n't catch on fire the way a traditional lithium-ion battery can . They are also significantly lighter and cost less to manufacture , compared to the battery in a Tesla Model S , for instance , which weighs 1,200 pounds and costs $ 12,000 .
“ Disruptive start-up technology is meeting the broad systems knowledge and financial resources of a multinational company , ” says Dr. Volkmar Denner , the chairperson of the board of management of Robert Bosch GmbH .
For years , automakers and suppliers have been trying to create more powerful batteries . Michigan-based startup Sakti3 ( which James Dyson invested $ 15m in earlier this year ) and Quantumscape are also working on solid-state batteries for electric cars , having partnered with General Motors and Volkswagen Group , respectively .
But according to MIT Technology Review , the energy storage capacity of some other similar batteries – at least at the size needed in electric cars – has been less than what Seeo has achieved .
This news comes on the heels of Volkswagen 's emissions-cheating scandal , which revealed that 11 million VW car engines pumped out 40 times the allowable smog-forming pollution .
Analysts have said this could lead to a rise in hybrid and electric vehicle production as automakers work to reach strict federal fuel regulations by the middle of next decade .
Already , reports predict that more than a third of all new European cars will be electrically powered – the majority as plug-in hybrids . If Bosch could pull this off , it could be the dominant battery producer in a very lucrative market .
LONDON -- Arsene Wenger says they are n't afraid to get tough with Mesut Ozil , but has defended the German 's much-criticised performance against Tottenham .
Ozil was again singled out by pundits following Arsenal 's performance in the 2-0 defeat at White Hart Lane on Sunday , with some questioning their commitment and attitude amid a long standoff concerning a contract negotiation .
It has also led some to question whether Wenger is tough enough on the playmaker , especially in contrast to Jose Mourinho , whose Manchester United side is up next for the Gunners on Sunday .
Ozil writes in their new autobiography that Mourinho 's way of motivating them at Real Madrid sometimes included heated arguments in the dressing room , and that the Portuguese manager even called them `` a coward '' for not going into tackles .
Wenger uses a much less confrontational style with their players -- but insisted that he 's had a few choice words to say to Ozil at times as well .
`` Yes they need [ tough love ] , '' Wenger admitted . `` We had some good conversations with them as well , you know . But they have not necessarily had time to write the book so you do n't know about it . I do n't tell you what I tell them . ''
Ozil showed great form in the first half of the season , but their productivity has dropped off dramatically since Christmas . However , Wenger insisted that the performance against Tottenham was in part due to fatigue following the FA Cup semifinal win over Manchester City and league victory over Leicester .
`` To just criticise Mesut Ozil 's performance does not reflect exactly what happened on the pitch , '' they said . `` Overall I believe recently they have put a lot of effort in . They were a bit , like the rest of the team , not physically at their best . I felt that we gave a lot on Sunday [ against City ] , Wednesday and had not completely recovered for the game .
Mesut Ozil has come under fire from fans for some of their recent performances .
`` And they were one of them as well . Overall the big players get more criticised than the others . Secondly their style is more fluid , less aggressive but it does n't mean you want it less than others . ''
Ozil 's up-and-down form has been a source of frustration to fans , who have seen them mix world-class performances with disappearing acts too often this season . But Wenger said even superstars ca n't be at their peak every game .
`` At the end of the day you want all your players to be at their best in every single game so when they do n't achieve that of course you are frustrated , '' they said . `` But we 've all played football , we know we are only human beings and you have to accept the ups and downs . ''
Ozil and fellow star Alexis Sanchez have yet to agree contract extensions , with talks now on hold until the summer . With both demanding wages north of £250,000 per week , some fans are now starting to question whether the duo is actually worth that money .
Wenger has repeatedly said they expect both players to eventually sign new deals , but insisted that the club has to take other players into consideration before handing mega deals to the star duo . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain , Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere are among other Arsenal players who will also need new deals this summer .
`` You know me for a long time , before we spend big money we analyse all the aspects of commitments because we have not only Mesut Ozil and Sanchez to extend , '' they said . `` We have many other players to extend and you have to make sure you have the resources available to extend the other players that you think are needed to be successful in the future . ''
If Ozil does n't sign a new deal , they should n't have any shortage of suitors come in for him , despite their inconsistent form this season .
But when asked if Arsenal have received any offers for him , Wenger insisted : `` No . Not officially . ''

FOR the past four years , country-music fans have gathered on a 15-acre lot across from the Mandalay Bay Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip for the Route 91 music festival . On October 1st Jason Aldean , a honey-voiced singer from central Georgia , was closing out the festival when a shooter opened fire on the crowd from the 32nd storey of the hotel . Social-media videos showed revellers ducking , hiding and running from bursts of automatic-weapon fire .
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor 's Picks .
The horrific event lasted just a couple of hours : Las Vegas police received their first report of gunfire at 10.08pm ; shortly before midnight police announced that their sole suspect was dead ; they are believed to have committed suicide . The suspect was Stephen Paddock , a 64-year-old resident of Mesquite , Nevada , a small town about 80 miles north-east of Las Vegas , on the Nevada-Arizona border .
Joe Lombardo , sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department , said the shooting was the act of “ a solo actor…a lone wolf ” . Police found a number of guns in Mr Paddock 's hotel room . They appear to have killed at least 58 people and wounded at least 527 , making this the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history .
American politicians routinely warn against “ politicising ” mass shootings . Although they take to the airwaves to discuss airline safety in the wake of a plane crash or security measures after a terrorist attack , discussing gun laws after a lunatic shoots scores of people to death—asking whether , perhaps , the ease of obtaining weapons in America might have something to do with the frequency with which mass murderers kill people with firearms—is understood to somehow be in bad taste . So let 's not mention the massacres at Port Arthur and Dunblane , which prompted Australia and Britain to pass more restrictive gun laws that dramatically reduced the risk of dying by gunshot in both countries .
This week the House of Representatives could pass the “ Hearing Protection Act ” , which rolls back restrictions on gun silencers . It was supposed to be taken up in June , but was postponed after a gunman opened fire on a congressional softball game . Separate legislation in the House would allow holders of concealed-carry permits to carry their weapons in other states with more restrictive licensing—effectively gutting state-level concealment restrictions . As Barack Obama said after a married couple slaughtered 14 people in San Bernardino , California with legally bought guns , “ We 've become numb to this…This is a political choice we make to allow this to happen every few months in America . ”
Update ( October 3rd , 12.30pm London time ) : This piece has been amended to reflect an increase in the number of those killed and wounded .
Correction ( October 5th , 10am London time ) : The headline figure has been revised down from 59 to 58 to exclude the shooter .
A common phenomenon experienced by those who regularly remember their dreams is the prevalence of recurring dreams .
This can be the same dream that happens over and over again , not always on consecutive nights , but over a period of time . This can also be a dream that has the same structure and themes , but one piece of it changes each time or perhaps it is the same dream again and again until finally something in the dream shifts .
What is the function of recurring dreams ?
If we remember that the function of any dream is to help move our lives forward , continuing on the human journey of exploration , growth and creativity/creation , then a recurring dream could be seen to carry a particularly important message for us .
Our dreams will have similar themes and threads that appear in many story lines until we receive the message and honor it . What elevates a recurring dream from this is that it is focused on some part of us that is more fundamental to our true nature and is deeply embedded in the patterns we play out in waking life . It 's regular occurrence calls extra attention to it .
Think of a recurring dream as a friend that is gently , but continuously reminding us , `` You 're doing that thing again ... '' as they draw our attention to a habit that is so deeply engrained that it is often unconscious when it is being triggered even if we are aware of it at other times .
From this perspective , we can still approach the dream the way we would approach other dreams , paying attention to the archetypal , symbolic level of the dream for information , the emotions and embodied feeling of the dream symbols and patterns that relate to moving our lives forward .
Given that they are recurring , there is an extra tool to work with , and that is the x factor . The x factor would be any part of the recurring dream that changes OR the events in our waking lives that seem to trigger this dream to show up . ( This is where keeping a dream journal can really be helpful , especially if we 've been noting the date of our dreams and what is going on in our waking lives at the time . )
My most recent recurring dream went like this :
I was always about to get married to someone who did n't make sense . In some cases it was an ex-boyfriend from long ago , another time it was my cousin and another time it was a close friend . Each time I felt extreme tension around the upcoming nuptials because I really thought it was wrong to be married to this person . I always felt it was obvious and did n't understand why everyone else could n't see that or how I even got to this point . Each time , I would break off the wedding and feel complete relief while everyone else felt angry with me .
The last time I had the dream , before I could break off the wedding , I went outside to get fresh air and ended up at the ocean . I met a guy there who showed me this superhighway current that you could ride . I laid on my back in the water and floated away at turbo speed , staring up at a huge starry sky and feeling relieved , excited and whole .
It took me a long time with this dream to let go of what was obvious in waking life ... that I would never even get to the point of marrying any of these people . I was really afraid that the dream was about my ability to commit to something or about sabotaging relationships that I cared about . I was clinging to the reality of the dream rather than sinking into the emotional , symbolic level .
When I was able to work with a dream practitioner , they guided me out of that space . They took me to the unique part of the dream that showed up only the last time I had it ... the cool , supportive , wild space of the ocean . I went back into the dream and both described and truly felt how easy that part of the dream was . My body could physically feel how the water seemed to melt away the tension and how I surrendered to it .
I was able to see that the marriage in the dream represented the black and white , dualistic mindset that I often get caught in . You are never kind of married ; either you are or you are not and it is a big commitment . At critical crossroads in waking life , I often do go to that place of black or white , yes or no , success or failure , etc . I cling to it and cut off my creativity and my ability to grow by seeing another way . I blind myself to options and keep myself stuck .
It became incredibly freeing when I got to feel the freedom of letting go when I did the dream work on this recurring dream . I was able to embody the feeling of release and possibility when I let go of the attachment I had to one way or another . Not only was it ok to do this , but when I did , I became a better person . It was necessary .
Dreams will often challenge you to to do this . Wherever the dream holds the most tension and resistance is usually where the invitation resides to our biggest learning that involves a fundamental shift in mindset , behavior or both .
Just as storytelling is a powerful tool for relating to each other , connecting and sharing in the human experience , so can dream guide us into the same territories . I share my dreams here because we can all learn from each other 's dreams since they deal with the values and themes of what it means to be alive .
I extend an open invitation to share your dreams with me and any insights or reactions you feel from sharing in my dream stories too .
Fluoride will not be added to Gatineau 's drinking water supply despite a recommendation by Outaouais public health officials in Quebec .
Gatineau city council voted 16-2 against fluoridating the city 's water Tuesday following a short debate .
Council acknowledged a report that included a recommendation from Outaouais public health authorities recommending fluoridation . The practice is linked to a reduction in tooth decay among the population .
Drinking water fluoridation Advocates say : The incidence of tooth decay is reduced among the population when fluoride is added to drinking water .
Levels of fluoride found naturally in some water sources is far higher than the levels that would be added to prevent tooth decay .
Many studies show no adverse health or environmental effects linked to fluoridation of drinking water . Opponents say : Some studies show a statistically significant link between exposure to high levels of fluoride and detrimental health effects such as increased risk of bone fractures , reduction of thyroid function , reduced IQ , bone cancer , and tooth discolouration .
It 's not necessary to expose the entire body to fluoride through ingestion because its positive effects come from its application to teeth , and fluoride-containing toothpastes are readily available .
However , councillors opposed to fluoridation said there was a lack of scientific consensus about the benefits , and some said they have the impression of widespread opposition to the practice in their ward . Mayor Marc Bureau said they thought it should be up to the province to decide whether drinking water should be fluoridated .
Quebec covers the cost of fluoridation for municipalities that choose the treatment for their water .
Pierre Philion , councillor for Saint-Raymond-Vanier , who is in favour of fluoridation , suggested having a referendum on the issue . However , Bureau said the city will not pay for that .
Public health officials said they will respect council 's decision .
A report sent by Outaouais public health authorities to Gatineau council on March 31 recommended fluoridation because it is linked to fewer dental cavities . A telephone survey of 400 Gatineau residents 18 and over conducted by health authorities between April 19 and 20 found 58 per cent of respondents is in favour . Only 25 per cent were opposed . The survey is considered accurate within plus or minus 4.9 percentage points 19 times out of 20 .
Drinking water in nearby Ottawa has been fluoridated since 1964 .
In 1947 , just as the Iron Curtain fell across Europe , John Steinbeck , the American writer , and Robert Capa , renowned war photographer , made a six-week journey through Stalin 's Russia . The following year they published A Russian Journal , a book that painted a sympathetic portrait of ordinary Soviets . Seventy years on , Julius Strauss , a former long-serving war correspondent , and Thomas Dworzak , the president of Magnum Photos , retraced their footsteps .
At first blush the world they flew into in a sleek new Aeroflot jet bore little resemblance to Stalin 's Soviet Union . But soon , Strauss and Dworzak realised that the parallels with the early Cold War were more poignant than they imagined . Russia was in the grips of vigorous militarism and strident nationalism and seeking to re-establish spheres of dominance abroad . Shiny new museums glorified the Soviet past with multi-media displays and smart military parades showcased reconstituted Tsarist-era regiments . Officials railed against what they see as the West 's effete liberal values and its perfidy and aggression . Meanwhile Ukraine and Georgia were struggling to fight off Moscow 's unwanted advances and steer their countries westwards .
Following in Steinbeck and Capa 's footsteps , Strauss and Dworzak found themselves in a patchwork of new states , hopscotching across a jagged frontline where the writ of the Kremlin and the West met . And as Strauss and Dworzak moved from Russia to the frontlines in Ukraine to the frozen conflicts of Georgia they realised that the glitzy and outwardly confident Moscow of today hid darker truths . Only on one thing do both pro and anti-Russian officials in the region agree . A new war was already underway – a struggle that pitted Putin 's Kremlin , the Russian Orthodox Church and the revamped Red Army against those who believe in NATO , the European ideal , and western liberal values .
Hiking during mud season requires extra planning , extra caution , and extra attention to the environment .
Tips
Stay on the trail- During mud season nature is much more vulnerable , soil is more susceptible to erosion , and vegetation can become easily damaged . To help protect fragile vegetation and prevent trail erosion , it is important to keep to the trail even if it means trudging through deep mud . Waterproof shoes , gaiters , and extra socks will be helpful in keeping your feet warm and dry .
Remember trails and conditions can dramatically change - It might appear to be a warm and springlike day at the trailhead but it is common to encounter deep mud , rushing water , and snow or ice on the way up to higher elevations . Rocks can be slippery , loose , and unstable as water from melting snow seeps down the trails . Bring traction devices such as micro spikes or crampons for any left over snow and ice . Trekking poles may also come in handy to help keep you stable on slippery footing .
Give yourself extra time- The varying trail conditions may slow your usual hiking pace . Give yourself some extra time when planning hikes and keep in mind that even if the days are getting warmer , mornings and nights in the mountains may have a significant drop in temperature . Pack extra layers to be prepared for any change in condition .
Look for lower elevation alternatives- Spring and mud season are great times to explore new trails and peaks that you may have passed up due to their lower elevation . Staying off popular trails helps reduce trail erosion and can help protect fragile alpine negation during this vulnerable season .
Gear List
Having the right gear not only keeps you dry and safe when you are hiking it also makes the hike that much more enjoyable knowing you are prepared ! Here are some basic things that you should have ready to go before you get out there .
Waterproof boots
Gaiters
Traction – microspikes , crampons
Trekking poles
Waterproof jacket
Pants
Extra layers
Extra socks
Emergency and first aid kit

A Switzerland-based spaceflight company is finalizing plans with Canada over a potential launch site for a new private space plane , which is slated to launch a satellite to clean up space junk by 2018 .
The company , Swiss Space Systems ( S3 ) , plans to launch the new Clean Space One satellite using the European Suborbital Reusable Shuttle , a small space plane the firm is developing for low-cost launches off the back of a modified Airbus A300 jumbo jet .
CleanSpace One is a 66-pound ( 30 kilograms ) technology demonstration spacecraft designed to link up with Switzerland 's out-of-commission SwissCube nanosatellite — a small cube that measures 3.93 inches ( 10 centimeters ) on each side — and safely de-orbit the target craft . The mission aims to demonstrate orbital identification and rendezvous with an uncooperative target and has an estimated cost of about 15 million Swiss Francs ( $ 16 million ) . [ See photos of the CleanSpace One space junk cleaning satellite ]

SOAR developer S3 is CleanSpace One 's primary sponsor , and will pay $ 5.3 million for assembling and testing the satellite 's components and ground-based command operations . The company has also set aside $ 10.7 million for its own SOAR launch system .
North America and Spain are home to candidate launch sites for the SOAR space plane , so S3 officials have been talking to the U.S. government 's Federal Aviation Administration , its Canadian equivalent , Transport Canada and the European Aviation Safety Agency , of which Spain is a member state .
`` In 2018 , [ CleanSpace One ] this will be one of our first launches , if not the first one , '' Grégoire Lorétan , head of S3 communications , told SPACE.com in an email . Lorétan added that S3 would have an announcement about a partnership with Canada in `` a few weeks . ''
S3 's SOAR space plane is designed to launch payloads of up to 551 pounds ( 250 kg ) into low-Earth orbit . Because CleanSpace One is being built with commercial off-the-shelf parts , its weight is a low 66 pounds . [ SOAR Space Plane Concept : How It Flies ( Video ) ]
Swiss space junk target
CleanSpace One 's first satellite target for a de-orbit demonstration will Switzerland 's SwissCube nanosat to avoid potential legal issues or other concerns surrounding the de-orbiting of a satellite owned by a party from another country . A satellite that can dock with and deorbit a spacecraft could potentially be used as a sort of anti-satellite weapon .
The United Nations ' Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space told CleanSpace One designer , the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) , it was concerned about other people 's debris being de-orbited . The U.N. wanted EPFL to only deorbit its own spacecraft and SwissCube , launched in September 2009 , an EPFL craft . [ Related : Incredible Technology — How to Clean Up Space Junk ]
École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne , located in Lausanne , Switzerland on the edge of Lake Geneva , is one of the country 's Federal Institutes of Technology . In a phone interview with SPACE.com on Sept. 11 , Volker Gass , the director of EPFL 's space center , explained why they are developing CleanSpace One . Gass said : `` It [ SwissCube ] came within 75 meters [ 246 feet ] of another debris this morning . This debris topic is very hot . ESA is already working on this for managing debris , and agencies like CNES [ the French space agency ] and DLR [ Germany aerospace agency ] are looking into this and funding projects to do demonstrations . ”
In addition to the CleanSpace One effort , EPFL has been working with the European Space Agency on new technologies for spacecraft propulsion , navigation , reconnaissance systems and hardware for anchoring a satellite to pieces of space debris . Switzerland 's Swiss Universities of Applied Science and the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich , in the Swiss city of Zurich , are providing technical know-how and technology . In 2012 , EPFL predicted then that CleanSpace One would cost $ 10.7 million to design , construct and launch and that the first orbital rendezvous would occur by 2017 .
According to EPFL , the Swiss Re insurance company said in 2011 that it had found an almost 1-in-10,000 chance that a large satellite traveling in a low-Earth orbit , below 650 miles , will collide with space junk larger than 0.39 inches ( 1 cm ) . Meanwhile , in July of this year NASA 's Orbital Debris Program Office stated in its quarterly bulletin that , as of Jan. 1 of 2013 , there are estimated to be at least 16,500 human-made objects larger than 3.93 inches ( 10 cm ) orbiting the Earth , and thousands more that are between 0.39 and 3.93 inches . [ Worst Space Debris Events of All Time ]
Gass told SPACE.com that the EPFL envisages a family of spacecraft for the various sizes of debris , yet they added the organization will not enter into the business of providing debris deorbiting services . Lorétan confirmed in their Sept. 12 email that S3 would also not provide a debris deorbit service .
Acknowledging that the CleanSpace One technology can be used to extend a spacecraft 's lifespan , Gass told SPACE.com , `` [ life extension ] it is a very good approach and we are also looking into these elements and this is the whole topic of orbital debris in general , not just the CleanSpace One mission . ''
Space junk menace looms
EPFL is not the first European organization to examine spacecraft life extension . In 2007 , there were two European companies , the U.K.-based Orbital Satellite Services and Greco-German company Kosmas Georing Services promoting their life extension spacecraft and announcing customers . [ Space Junk Photos and Cleanup Concepts ]
Orbital had identified 140 commercial satellites that by 2017 could have been serviced by its 1,000-pound ( 453 kg ) spacecraft . Kosmas ' refueling spacecraft , called Hermes , had a customer with Middle Eastern satellite operator Arabsat . Kosmas had priced its refuelling services at up to 10 million euros ( $ 13.2 million ) per 110 pounds ( 50 kg ) of propellant .
The U.S. Department of Defense has looked at similar technology . From 2003 to 2008 , the military 's Defense Advanced Research Project Agency ( DARPA ) performed studies such as the Spacecraft for the Universal Modification of Orbits ( SUMO ) and Front-end Robotics Enabling Near-term Demonstration from 2003 to 2008 . DARPA 's SUMO website stated that , `` SUMO can perform station-keeping and attitude control and modify the spacecraft 's orbit , '' indicating the military 's interest in deorbiting combatant 's uncooperative satellites .
In 2007 , DARPA successfully carried out an in-orbit servicing demonstration mission with its Orbital Express vehicle . The agency is currently developing the Phoenix space debris cleanup and salvage satellite , which would use parts from dead satellites to fix other satellites or build new craft in space .

SOAR space plane launch plans
In addition to CleanSpace One project work , S3 announced on Sept. 30 a launch deal to launch 28 satellites for the Swiss microgravity medical experiment specialist Spacepharma , which is based in Delémont city in North West Switzerland . Under the deal , S3 's SOAR space plane will launch four of Spacepharma 's 11-pound ( 5 kg ) satellites in 2018 and the remaining 24 spacecraft are to be orbited by the suborbital shuttle at a rate of one per month over the following 24 months .
Spacepharma 's satellites are based on Cubesat technology and will carry medical experiments onboard . The company hopes to eventually evolve its small spacecraft design into a larger 110-pound ( 50 kg ) version .
S3 already had four launch agreements with one of its partner organizations , Belgium 's Von Karman Institute , a fluid dynamics research , prior to the Spacepharma deal .
For more than $ 10 million , the reusable SOAR space plane will carry commercial satellites from 33,000 feet to an altitude of nearly 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) , but not beyond the accepted boundary of space , which is 62 miles ( 100 km ) . The satellites are released from SOAR 's cargo bay at an altitude of 50 miles , with the payload 's own rocket engine then igniting to kick it up to about 434 miles above the Earth . SOAR 's maiden flight is planned for late 2017 .
Lorétan told SPACE.com in their Sept. 12 email that SOAR 's Systems Requirements Review , which is a basic design review , would come later this fall , and S3 would `` communicate about this milestone soon . ''
The total development cost for the SOAR launch system is estimated to be about $ 214 million . Lorétan declined to say who is providing the funds , but confirmed that the funding was in place for this year and `` our budget is covered by our partners and private investors . ''
After releasing its cargo SOAR glides back to its spaceport , which could be in the United States , Canada or Spain or in the other candidate sites of Malaysia and Morocco . S3 expects to be making an announcement soon about the progress of its partner Spaceport Malaysia .

Sky 's the limit
However , Lorétan held out the prospect of satellites being thrown higher and further , as at S3 , they `` know that the SOAR has the capability to go up to Mach 10 [ 10 times the speed of sound ] as a drone for the launching of satellites , '' they stated . SOAR will initially reach three times the speed of sound for its passenger flights from 2020 , while reaching the speed of Mach 10 will enable SOAR to make transcontinental point-to-point journeys , Lorétan added .
Lorétan expects that manned flight tests will be carried out with the help of ESA 's European Astronaut Centre and Franco-Italian company Thales Alenia Space .
Thales , one of S3 's partners , provided pressurized vessels for the International Space Station and it has signed a contract with S3 for that technology . The pressure vessel will initially be used to carry experiments and the technology could create a passenger cabin .
In March , S3 told SPACE.com that it planned to announce in April the company providing SOAR 's liquid oxygen and kerosene-fueled rocket engine . In their email , Lorétan said : `` We do n't communicate this information due to signed [ nondisclosure agreements ] NDAs . What we can mention is that the engine of the SOAR and the upper stage both come from the same country and we are currently discussing the issues related to the export of these engines . ''
However , on Sept. 23 , S3 announced a partnership with Russia 's Bauman Moscow State Technical University ( BMSTU ) stating that BMTSU students will , `` pursue their research work in relations to S3 propulsion systems , one of the key elements for the SOAR shuttle and its expendable upper stage . '' The university has produced engineers for the Soviet Union and subsequently Russian space programs and Russia is the country with the most experience in liquid oxygen and kerosene rocket engines .

Over the years , I 've had a few extended periods in which I lived with very limited control over my thoughts . I assume that everyone has the occasional intrusive thought ; that seems fairly normal to me—at least until I pause to consider it : How is it that you ca n't control your thoughts , when to at least some extent you are your thoughts ? Regardless of whether you want to follow Descartes all the way down their rabbit hole , they were certainly onto something when they concluded , “ I think , therefore I am . ”
Recently , I had occasion to consider this question with some urgency , as I found myself a passenger in my own consciousness for about a month . I suppose it was a bout of depression , although OCD , depression and anxiety intermingle so thoroughly that it 's hard to sort the one from the other . Regardless , it became impossible to write or to read , and suddenly , I had a newfound appreciation for the phrase “ think straight. ” It was impossible to think straight because my thinking circled back on itself in a ceaseless spiral .

But then I got better . Having been sick before and being in the privileged position of having access to excellent health care , I was surrounded by people who told me my pain would end , that I would not always feel how I felt at my sickest . There is hope , even if getting good treatment is difficult , especially in a health-care system that too often fails to acknowledge the seriousness of mental illness . People get better every day . Of course , they get sick , too . The metaphors we most often employ when discussing disease—that it is an enemy to defeat , or a hurdle to jump and put behind us—do n't really apply to chronic illness . Instead , you live with it . You get better . You get worse . You get better again . Sometimes you 're driving the bus and sometimes you are n't , but the bus rumbles along regardless .
You go on .

The Philadelphia 76ers picked up their first win of the season Friday , only to come right back and drop their next game the following night . On Sunday , the team used its day off to regain clearance for takeoff by visiting the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston .
Rather than focus all of their attention on Monday 's matchup against the Houston Rockets , the Sixers instead received a private tour of the facility where human spaceflight training , research and flight control are conducted .
Philadelphia point guard Sergio Rodriguez snapped a photo of the main control room , which featured the 76ers logo on a central monitor .
NASA astronaut Christina Hammock Koch helped guide the NBA players throughout the complex , and posted a photo of Sixers centers Jahlil Okafor attempting to stand inside a space station bedroom . The 6-foot-11 Okafor knows a thing or two about making moves in tight quarters , but this situation presented more of a challenge .

The Sixers might have felt as if they were flying through space , but the reality is that they enter Monday 's game last in the Eastern Conference with a 1-8 record .

Stability reigns on the crytpocurrency markets this week as we have had another day of relative calm with bitcoin 's market cap remaining almost flat after the craziness of the last couple of weeks .
Litecoin however saw modest growth of almost 5 % in the last 24 hours probably thanks to Chinese exchange Huobi commencing trading in the cryptocurrency ( see below for more details ) .
Auroracoin , the Icelandic cryptocurrency , however saw a drop of 8.5 % yesterday though it 's unclear why the unique cryptocurrency 's value has dropped in price .
Rainbowcoin mined out ?
The big winner in the last 24 hours was rainbowcoin which rose 145 % in value .
The cryptocurrency created for the LGBT community , rainbowcoin has been around for a less than a month but already almost 99 % of the 1 billion coins have been mined - likely due to poor coding in the first place .
According to a post in the Bitcoin Talk forum , someone called RainbowCoin says the developer of the cryptocurrency is just looking to cash in :
`` The [ developer ] owns many , many millions of these coins from weeks ( months ? ) ago when they offered to buy everyone 's supply at some ridiculously low price in QRK . Now they are trying to re-ignite the coin so they can dump their acquired at 100x profit . ''
Dogecoin donations for Kenya water crisis
The dogecoin community is at it again .
This time the focus of its altruistic efforts is the drought-stricken country of Kenya , with the Doge4Water campaign looking to amass 40 million dogecoins in time for World Water Day on 22 March .
The fundraising effort has already collected 17.5 million dogecoins ( currently worth around £9,240 ) with nine days to go reach their goal .
The Doge4Water campaign was the brainchild of digital currency entrepreneur Eric Nakagawa who has teamed up with the New York-based non-profit water : charity to try and raise funds to support a remote region in Kenya near the Tana River .
The money raised will go towards buying two drilling wells in Kenya as well as helping to provide access to water and provide locals with the tools to retrieve and store water .
Goldman Sachs weighs in on bitcoin
American investment bank Goldman Sachs has produced a report called All About Bitcoin and while some people may find reading the whole 25-page report interesting , most people just want the TLDR version .
So here it is :
`` Bitcoin likely ca n't work as a currency , but some sense that the ledger-based technology that underlies it could hold promise . ''
Goldman Sachs also gives its definition of what bitcoin is :
`` A speculative financial asset that can be used as a medium of exchange . ''
So there you have it , bitcoin is not a currency but could be a promising payment solution . Make of that what you will .
Litecoin debuts on Chinese exchange Huobi
One of the only ways for non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies to gain recognition and credibility is for exchanges to begin trading in them .
Therefore Huobi 's announcement that it will start trading litecoin on from 19 March is a big moment for the number two cryptocurrency .
Huobi is one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in China and will give a lot of credibility to litecoin , which has consistently been nipping at bitcoin 's heals as the world 's second most popular virtual currency .
A survey earlier this year found that one in five bitcoin investors also held some litecoin .
The move by Huobi echoes a similar move by BTC China last week .
$ 20M-a-month bitcoin mining operation
CloudHashing.com , a company which rents out its bitcoin processing power to customers , says that by the end of the month it will be operating at a capacity of 2.5 petahashes per second , meaning it could be mining up to $ 20 million worth of bitcoin every month .
This beats the Seattle-based operation of Dave Carlson which was opens its doors earlier in the week and reported it was earning its operator $ 8 million-a-month in bitcoin .

The Bears figured Marion Barber would be back in the mix against the Saints . That wo n't be the case .
Barber will miss their second consecutive game with a calf strain , according to a league source . Barber was held out of practice Thursday after returning to limited action Wednesday . They did n't re-injure the calf but felt some soreness after returning to practice .
With Barber out , Kahlil Bell remains the backup behind starter Matt Forte . The two combined for 26 carries against the Falcons , with Forte carrying it 16 times to Bell 's 10 .
Receiver Roy Williams ( groin ) and safety Chris Harris ( hamstring ) sat out for the second consecutive day , and both are likely to be game-time decisions . Guard Lance Louis ( ankle ) is expected to miss Sunday 's game .
“ Hopefully we 'll be able to get a couple of them back tomorrow and then have some decisions to make on game day , ” coach Lovie Smith said .

The results of the ground-breaking SALOME research , published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) Psychiatry , show chronic heroin addiction now has another effective treatment tool – hydromorphone , a licensed pain medication .
“ The findings of the SALOME researchers shine a new light on how we can help people with heroin addictions , ” said Health Minister Terry Lake . “ While methadone and suboxone are effective for many people with opioid addictions , there is a proportion of people who have not found success with these treatments . The SALOME study shows there are alternative treatments that may be able to help those who do n't respond to methadone and suboxone . This is very exciting research and could go a long way in helping those who need it . ”
SALOME , which stands for the Study to Assess Longer-term Opioid Medication Effectiveness , found hydromorphone ( HDM ) to be as effective as diacetylmorphine ( pharmaceutical-grade prescription heroin ) for people who have not benefited from previous treatments , such as methadone or suboxone .
Led by researchers from Providence Health Care ( PHC ) , the Centre for Health Evaluation and Outcome Sciences ( CHÉOS ) at St. Paul 's Hospital and the School of Population and Public Health of the University of British Columbia ( UBC ) , it 's the only clinical trial of its kind in the world .
“ Prior to SALOME , hydromorphone had never been evaluated as a substitution treatment for opioid dependence , ” said SALOME Principal Investigator Dr. Eugenia Oviedo-Joekes . “ Hydromorphone is a widely available licensed pain medication . Our study shows that hydromorphone is as effective as diacetylmorphine , providing a licensed alternative to treat severe opioid use disorder . Providing injectable opioids in specialized clinics under supervision ensures safety of both the patients and the community , and the provision of comprehensive care . ”
A total of 202 participants in Vancouver were randomized in a six-month double blind study to receive either injectable hydromorphone or injectable diacetylmorphine ( DAM ) . The medication was administered at PHC 's Crosstown Clinic under the supervision of an interdisciplinary team of physicians , nurses , social workers and counselors .
Key findings of the research include :
Injectable hydromorphone is as effective as injectable diacetylmorphine for long-term street opioid users not currently benefitting from available treatments ( estimated to be about 10 per cent of the opioid-dependent population not currently in treatment ) .
Study participants on both medications reported far fewer days of street-heroin and other opioid use at six months ( three to five days per month ) , compared to almost daily illicit opioid use prior to being enrolled in the study .
Participants also reported a significant reduction in days of illegal activities ( from an average of 14.1 days per month to less than four ) .
Almost 80 % were retained in treatment at six months .
Hydromorphone and diacetylmorphine are both safe when taken in a clinical setting . Out of a total of 88,451 injections , there were 14 overdoses and 11 seizures , all successfully managed in the clinic . If these events had occurred in the street , the outcomes may have been fatal .
“ As diacetylmorphine is not presently available in many countries for political and/or regulatory reasons , hydromorphone has a significant advantage as a legal , licensed pain medication , ” said Dr. Patricia Daly , Vancouver Coastal Health 's chief medical health officer . “ While methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone are effective heroin addiction treatments for many people and should remain the first line responses , no single treatment is effective for all individuals . Every person with severe opioid use disorder left untreated is at high risk of serious illness and premature death . ”
SALOME started in late 2011 and concluded in late 2015 . It is the follow-up study to the North American Opiate Medication Initiative ( NAOMI ) , North America 's first-ever clinical trial of diacetylmorphine/prescription heroin as an opioid agonist treatment medication .
These Bharatnatyam dancers have become the new faces of Vodafone 4G .
If you 've been watching Indian Premier League matches , you 've probably spotted a grandpa getting a tattoo and a granny going parasailing . They 're Vodafone India 's latest brand ambassadors for 4G - Shanta Dhananjayan , 73 , and V.P . Dhananjayan , 78 , now famous as Asha and Bala from Vodafone 's SuperNet 4G ads . So far , six ads are out . The films promote the brand 's data network that affords easy video calling , photo sharing , maps , video streaming and Facebook Live .
A real life couple from Chennai , Shanta and Dhananjayan are Padma Bhushan awardees ( Arts ) ; they 're both award-winning Bharatnatyam dancers , who teach dance and run a business in Chennai .
So how on earth did they land up on our TV screens during IPL 's ad slots ? Dhananjayan tells afaqs ! , `` Nirvana Films ( production house ) approached us to do this campaign . When I heard that Prakash Varma is directing the Vodafone ads , which are written by Ogilvy , we ventured into it . ''
And guess what . Their Ogilvy connection runs deep ; their elder son Sanjay works for Ogilvy New York . `` He did n't know that we were being approached to act in these Vodafone commercials , '' Dhananjayan says , `` When they ( Nirvana ) explained the copy , we found it very interesting . It was not like the usual ads . These were characters we were enacting . ''
Shanta adds , `` When we were approached , it sounded pretty interesting and we really did n't think this was going to end up becoming such a large scale ( campaign ) . It turned out to be very different from what we had envisaged earlier . '' No doubt , Shanta actually went parasailing to shoot for ad film No.4 . Not to mention the other crazy things they did - riding a scooter , dancing on a boat , partying with strangers . No mean feat , all this .
Dhananjayan says , `` It all happened suddenly in two days when we landed in Goa . Once we landed , the next day onwards , we were on the go . I do n't know how to ride a scooter . I had a tutor but that did n't work very well . Then , we came across a person who resembles me closely . They came to our rescue - a real God-sent . ''
They go on about the experience , `` At least Shanta was wearing a saree ; for me , wearing a shirt and shorts was difficult because I usually wear a veshti ( dhoti ) and jippa ( kurta ) . The last time I wore a shirt and shorts was when I was a little boy . But I am open minded and wanted to experiment . ''
The dancing-on-the-boat ad must have been a breeze for these two dancers , right ? Shanta answers , `` That was quite challenging because though we are dancers , this was a different take completely . I enjoyed it . Every moment was so enjoyable and the whole unit was so engrossed in everything that was happening there . It was very hot and uncomfortable at times and we were sweating it out , but all that was worth it . Prakash ( director , Nirvana ) would just come and tell us , 'This is what you have to do . Now it 's yours . You can do whatever you want . ' We had to also remember that we were not ourselves ; we were playing someone else and had to be 100 percent 'there ' . ''
Interestingly , this is not the first time the couple has acted in an ad film . Recalling a Nerolac Paints ad , Dhanajayan says , `` I once worked with director Rajiv Menon for Nerolac Paints . That was in Malayalam language for the Kerala market . ''
`` Once I did an ad for Kumaran Silks . We 've done an ad for a local ayurvedic oil company . The ad showed that after using that oil , we are still able to dance , '' laughs Shanta .
Talking about the reaction these ads have fetched , the couple tells afaqs ! , `` It has been fantastic . We have been getting calls and emails from all over the world . People are saying we are looking cute and natural - like we normally are . ''
Moments from the campaign , they tell us , that are being discussed the most include : the part where Shanta screams while parasailing , 'How do I come down ? ' and the part where they say , 'First time ( in Goa ) in 35 years ' in the taxi segment . `` People wait for those moments to come , '' Shanta laughs .
What has the Vodafone campaign done for the couple ? Dhananjayan says , `` People walking on the streets have started recognising us . They say , `` We thought you are only dancers ... now you are acting as well .... ''
They say , `` Acting is a part of Bharatnatyam . It is exaggerated acting , but for this we need to have a natural flair , '' going on to tell us that they used to act in dramas as a child and that the experience came in handy here . Shanta says , `` We breathe Bharatnatyam . We have a company , we perform , travel and now in our late 70s we are trying to take it a little easy ... our students , younger son and daughter-in-law , help us with more activities ... ''
What next for this spunky couple ? Tamil movies ? `` Sure , if it is a good character that will fetch me the best actor award then definitely yes , '' Dhananjayan signs off .

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - A group monitoring the Syrian civil war said insurgents killed at least 19 civilians after capturing an Alawite village from government control in western Syria on Thursday , but insurgents denied targeting civilians .
Residents from the village of al-Zara interviewed by state media said rebels had killed women , children and livestock .
Dozens of people are still missing , believed to have been abducted from the village , which lies close to a main highway linking the western cities of Homs and Hama , the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday .
The Observatory said the attackers included Islamist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham and the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front .
An Ahrar al-Sham spokesperson said : “ Civilians were not targeted . On the contrary factions made great effort to spare civilians and deal with prisoners humanely . ”
The Observatory cited sources saying the 19 dead , who included six women , were from families of fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and were killed as rebels stormed houses during their attack on al-Zara .
An image shared on social media purported to show rebel fighters next to the bodies of two women in al-Zara .
Responding to the image , an alliance of rebel groups behind the attack said the women had been killed because they were armed and opened fire during the fighting .
It said in a statement that the way some fighters had dealt with enemy corpses as shown in the photo was against their religious values and the perpetrators would be held to account .
HIDING IN THE ATTIC
The army and its allies trying to retake the Alawite village have used air strikes and barrel bombs , and were still fighting insurgents nearby , the monitoring group said .
The Alawites are a minority sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam . Assad , an Alawite , is supported by Shi'ite fighters from Iran and Lebanon 's Hezbollah in the war against mainly Sunni Muslim rebels , backed by regional Sunni Muslim powers .
At least eight of the rebels had been killed , the Observatory said . The insurgents had also captured government fighters .
Syrian state television broadcast interviews with men and children who had fled the attack . They said rebels killed women , children and elderly people , slaughtered livestock and destroyed houses as they attacked .
“ I saw armed men coming into houses , they started fighting and destroying things . So I hid in the attic and waited there ... , ” said Isa Rai , a young boy interviewed by Syrian television . “ Then at night I came out when the army reached us . ”
A Feb. 27 cessation of hostilities agreement brokered by the United States and Russia reduced violence in western Syria for a short time . It has been reduced to tatters , however , by increased fighting in the city of Aleppo and other areas .
The village of al-Zara is about 35 km ( 22 miles ) north of Homs and a similar distance south of Hama , an area which was among the first to be hit when Russia 's air force intervened to support Assad last September .
The Federazione dei Comunisti Anarchici supports all initiatives in defence of the public ownership of water . Our members participated in the referendum campaign promoted by the Forum Acqua Bene Comune which gathered 1,400,000 signatures thanks to the dedication of thousands of ordinary citizens .
We are aware that the management of collective resources and goods by publicly-run bodies generally produces bad management of resources , as a result of the inevitable ignorance on the part of the state bureaucratic apparatus of the needs and wishes of local communities . We are also aware that this translates into social difficulties , especially for the poorer levels of the population .
However , we are aware too that the management of collective resources by free-market capitalism only produces even worse conditions in the material life of the working class and the poorest elements of society , since these resources then become simply a way to create profit for capitalist businesses .
Private management turns inalienable collective resources such as water into just another commodity to be traded in the capitalist market , and therefore subject to the laws of profit and to the speculative caprices of that market , which forces private competitors to keep the cost-benefit ratio as low as possible . This translates into dearer , lower-quality services for citizens .
For these reasons , members of the Federazione dei Comunisti Anarchici will be participating in the various initiatives by the national forum in defence of public water in their local areas on 4th December , in the knowledge that autonomous self-management of vital resources throughout the territory , by means of direct control by local bodies of producers , is not only possible but necessary if we do not wish to see the environment in which we live definitively and irreversibly ruined by the greed for profit of capitalist oligarchies , or left to deteriorate under state bureaucratism .
National Secretariat
When Sally Yates was questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee before their appointment as Deputy Attorney General , Mr . Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions , III asked them a key question .
`` Well , you have to watch out because people will be asking you to do things and you have to say no , '' Sessions admonished . `` Do you think the Attorney General has the responsibility to say no to the President if they ask for something that 's improper ? ''
They went on to use the Lynch nomination as an example of what they meant . `` He appointed somebody who 's going to execute their views . What 's wrong with that ? ''
But , `` If the views the president wants to execute are unlawful , should the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General say no ? ''
`` Senator , I believe that the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution , and to give their independent legal advice to the President , '' they answered .
Tonight they made good on that answer , and was fired for it . Video is below .

Meanwhile , the new Acting Attorney General bows before Hair Trump :
While many Americans were paying attention to things other than politics on Good Friday , Maryland 's Democrat delegates were ramming through Gov . Martin O'Malley 's gun grabbing legislation S.B . 281 .
This measure is an “ assault weapons ” ban which is so draconian that it punishes law-abiding gun owners whose guns are stolen from their homes . In this way , the legislation not only bars the procurement of new “ assault weapons ” but also turns ownership of weapons acquired before the ban into a risky proposition .
Republican delegate Mike Smigiel offered an amendment that would have changed the language in S.B . 281 so as to protect gun owners by punishing criminals who steal guns instead , but Democrats mounted a push keep Smigiel 's amendment from passing .
Former Secret Service Agent and 2012 candidate for U.S. Senate in Maryland Daniel Bongino spoke to Breitbart News and described the antics behind the defeat of Smigiel 's amendment :
Political cowards in the Maryland legislature scheduled a gun hearing on Good Friday to avoid media attention after a massive public outcry against this overreaching legislative firearm grab . Then…they broke their own parliamentary procedures in order to punish legal firearm owners and protect criminals . Republican delegate Mike Smigiel introduced a common-sense amendment to Gov . O'Malley 's S.B . 281–an amendment that would have punished criminals who steal guns from the homes of their owners . The original bill only punished the firearm owner for having their or their home broken into , but contained no punishment for the actual criminal . Smigiel 's amendment passed on a proper committee vote . But the committee Chair then took the unprecedented step of ordering a new vote . The Chair was then able to use bullying tactics to force two Democrats to change their votes which , in turn , killed the amendment .
The day before the vote on S.B . 281 took place , the NRA used similar language in warning of Gov . O'Malley 's “ deceptive tactics and political bullying . ”
Last November , voters in Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana . The off-year election tomorrow is not as exciting , except if you live in Portland , Maine , Colorado and MIchigan , where important pro-pot initiatives are on the ballot .
• In Portland , voting Yes on Question 1 would remove civil penalties for possessing up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana in the city of 66,000 . Currently , Maine is decriminalized , but still allows for a fine of up to $ 600 for small-scale possession .
• In Colorado , Prop AA , if passed , would impose a 10 % sales tax on marijuana in the state as well as a 15 % excise tax . The marijuana sales tax would be in addition to the state 's already-existing sales tax , and that additional sales tax could even get hiked up to 15 % if the legislature decided to do so . Colorado NORML opposes the proposition .
• In New York , Democratic mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio has a commanding 40 point lead over Republican opponent Joe Lhota . Both support further decriminalizing marijuana in the state , but disagree on the NYPD 's controversial stop and frisk tactic , which had been ruled unconstitutional until an appeals court overturned that decision on Oct. 31 . De Blasio opposes stop and frisk and says about marijuana , `` Arresting people for displays of small amounts is ridiculous . ''
• Also in New York , the candidates for Brooklyn District Attorney , Democrat Ken Thompson and Republican incumbent Charles Hynes , have locked horns over how to handle marijuana arrests in the borough/county and the state . Thompson favors further decrim , Hynes does n't . The country of Kings ( a.k.a Brooklyn ) has the most pot arrests in the state .
• In Michigan , voters in three cities - Ferndale , Jackson and Lansing - can tell police to deprioritize marijuana arrests . In recent years , Detroit , Flint , Grand Rapids and Ypsilanti have done just that . In Jackson , police are not opposing the measure .
About 340,000 of the 4.3 million babies born in the United States in 2008 — or 8 percent — had at least one parent who was an illegal immigrant , according to a study published Wednesday by the Pew Hispanic Center , a nonpartisan research group in Washington .
Because they were born in this country , the babies of illegal immigrants are United States citizens . In all in 2008 , four million children who were American citizens had at least one parent who was in the country illegally , the Pew study found .
Children of illegal immigrants make up 7 percent of all people in the country younger than 18 years old , according to the study , which is based on March 2009 census figures , the most recent data on immigrant families . Nearly four out of five of those children — 79 percent — are American citizens because they were born here .
About 85 percent of the parents who are illegal immigrants are Hispanic , the Pew Center said .
The study comes as lawmakers in Washington have been debating whether to consider changing the 14th Amendment , which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States . The controversy began after Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina , said in July that they might offer an amendment to revoke birthright citizenship for the American-born children of illegal immigrants .

Mr. Graham 's comments touched a nerve with many Americans , who called in to talk shows to question whether the children of immigrants who have violated the law by remaining in the United States should be granted citizenship . But it was less clear that there was strong support for altering the Constitution to address the problem .
More than a year after council rewrote the taxi industry rules and legalized the UberX service in Toronto , the answer to the question did the city get it right depends on whom you ask . Mayor John Tory says the city achieved a “ balanced and effective ” licensing and regulatory model .
There are 49,585 UberX drivers now licensed by the city , including 33,000 who live outside Toronto . ( Ryan Remiorz / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )
The new regulations “ embrace innovation ” and are “ working well , ” agrees Uber Canada , and give the public access to a “ safe , reliable and affordable transportation option. ” And despite the company 's global challenges , including legal setbacks , lawsuits and scandals about Uber 's corporate culture , the UberX service — rides with regular drivers booked using a smartphone app — remains a popular option for budget-minded passengers looking to get around Toronto and the GTA . Not keen is the traditional taxi business , though the traffic-snarling protests and city hall demonstrations have ceased .

While the city loosened some of its regulatory burden , scrapping mandatory , 17-day driver training , for instance , the anger remains over the influx of UberX drivers — 49,585 now licensed by the city , including 33,000 who live outside Toronto — who are cutting into the taxi industry 's bottom line . There are an estimated 5,500 taxis in Toronto , though an additional 12,000 people hold licences to drive a taxi or limousine . “ When I think about these so-called balanced rules , the more embarrassed I am for anyone who has their name attached to it , ” says Beck taxi operations manager Kristine Hubbard . “ UberX drivers are simply tens of thousands of cars on our already congested streets. ” Uber Canada spokesperson Susie Heath wrote in email that “ it is important to note that not every registered driver is active , for example someone may have registered with the city to drive for a few weeks to make some extra money around Christmas time but may not have driven since January. ” Adding to the taxi industry frustration is the absence of a promised one-year review of the vehicle-for-hire bylaw , which came into effect July 15 , 2016 .
“ Is anyone at city hall paying attention to the dire state of affairs they 've created in Toronto 's vehicle-for-hire industry , ” screams a headline in the latest edition of Taxinews , a trade newspaper filled with anti-Uber articles and stories about the plight of cabbies . Municipal licensing and standards staff have n't had time to conduct the review because of other pressing matters , including the apartment and short-term rental bylaws and dealing with illegal pot shops , executive director Tracey Cook wrote in email .

“ The complexity ( of a vehicle-for-hire review ) . . . requires a great deal of research and stakeholder engagement , and as such , will take time. ” An area of concern the new regulatory framework appears to have addressed relates to insurance . It requires that all taxis and private transportation companies ( a new category of licence ) have at least $ 2 million in liability insurance . Two of the three top insurance companies in Ontario , Intact and Aviva , now offer “ hybrid ” products that allow consumers to use their private vehicle both commercially and privately , says Peter Karageorgos , director of consumer and industry relations for the Insurance Bureau of Canada . “ From our perspective , the industry has been able to provide the best possible coverage to consumers so people are protected , ” they said . The Financial Services Commission of Ontario says it has not received any complaints relating to insurance coverage for ride-hailing activities . So is Toronto better off with its new ground transportation order ? The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) studied the Toronto regulatory model and concluded it has been a success , though like any process there are winners and losers . “ Uber was likely the biggest winner by gaining first of its kind , friendly regulation in Toronto , ” says a 2017 OECD report called Working with Change . The biggest losers ? The owners of taxi licence plates , which have plummeted “ although it is hard to discern how much of that drop in value was due to the regulation , ” the OECD report says . Joeri van den Steenhoven , the former director of Toronto-based MaRS Solutions Lab , one of the world 's leading innovation hubs , believes the regulations strike “ a good balance between defending public value and allowing innovation. ” While at MaRS , they were involved in helping design the Toronto regulatory framework . “ The goal of regulation is not to block market access for new entrants , ” they wrote in an email sent from the Netherlands , where they are now based . “ The regulation aims to allow innovation in the marketplace but without loss of public value the city needs to protect . It therefore states clear requirements in terms of driving licensing , safety , consumer protection etc . but in a way that it allows for different operating models. ” But Sunil Johal , director of the Mowat Centre , School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Toronto , says it 's premature to know if the city got it right . “ We 're talking about what had been a very closed market for a number of decades and when you open up suddenly to more competition and to more operators , it 's going to take some time to observe what the impact of that change has been on the market in terms of profitability of taxis , customer service , and a whole range of different issues. ” While they understand taxi business resentment over the two-tiered system that now exists , Johal believes Toronto was right , at least in the short term , to embrace “ progress and technology. ” “ Opening up markets is a good thing for people but government and regulators have to keep their eye on the ball , and not say : ‘ We wrote the regulations back in 2016 , we 're done , ' ” Johal said . “ This is something you have to be monitoring very closely every year and adjusting rules when required . ”

Set aside for a moment all the controversies over illegal immigration—the wall , deportation , amnesty , Donald J. Trump , “ comprehensive immigration reform , ” etc . Instead , contemplate what happens in a social , cultural , and economic context when several million immigrants arrive from one of the poorest areas in the world ( e.g. , Oaxaca ) to one of the most affluent ( e.g. , California ) . For guidance , think not of Jorge Ramos , but of the premodern/postmodern collision that is occurring in Germany , Austria , and Denmark .
The first casualty is the law . I am not referring to the collapse of federal immigration enforcement , but rather the ripples that must follow from it . When someone ignores a federal statute , then it is naturally easy to flout more . In Los Angeles , half the traffic accidents are hit-and-run collisions . I can attest first-hand that running from an accident or abandoning a wrecked vehicle is certainly a common occurrence in rural California . Last night on a rural road , a driver behind me ( intoxicated ? Malicious ? Crazy ? ) apparently tried to rear-end me , then turned off their lights , sped up , and at the next stop sign pulled over swearing out the window in Spanish . In this age and in these environs , why would one call a sheriff for a minor everyday occurrence like that ? The point is simply that when there is no federal law , no one has any idea how several million arrive in the U.S. , much less what exactly they were doing before their illegal arrival . I note the latter consideration , because legal immigration does require some sort of personal history , and at the airport I am always asked by U.S Customs what exactly I was doing in Greece or Germany that prompted my trip .
Out here almost all laws concerning the licensing and vaccination of dogs seem to have simply disappeared . No one can walk or ride a bicycle along these rural roads without being attacked by hounds that are unlicensed and not vaccinated—and that have no ID or indeed owners that step forward to claim ownership once the victim is bleeding . The Bloomberg Rule reigns ( i.e. , if you ca n't keep snow off the street , deplore global warming or cosmic war ) : we talk of dreamers because we have not a clue how to ensure that hundreds of thousands of pets are registered and given rabies shots . No one suggests that once one breaks the law of their adopted home , and continues to do so through false affidavits , aliases , and fraudulent documents , then the law itself become an abstraction , useful as a shelter , expendable if an inconvenience . Again , one assumes that if a citizen were to do that , they would face a felony indictment .
I do n't think we have many zoning laws left , at least for particular constituencies . Yesterday , in field research for this essay , I drove in a 10-mile radius and counted the percentages of rural dwellings that had some sort of living quarters haphazardly attached—garages , Winnebagos , sheds , trailers , etc . Seven out of ten residences had multiple dwellings , and I counted an average of six cars at each residence—in a manner that 30 years ago would have quickly earned a visit from a county zoning officer ( or would today , if county officials thought the violator would pay quickly the fine ) . Noncompliance has apparently become a cultural and economic necessity—especially with bigger fish to fry ( such as the SWAT-team assault ¼ miles away last month on a den of supposed prostitution and drug sales , camouflaged in a barbed-wire enclosure in an orchard no less ) . That racket was certainly no “ act of love. ” Jeb Bush , where are you ? The arrested were not on their way to have ice cream when the SWAT team pounced . Barack , where are you ?
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In an interview with TF1 Francois Hollande says they will not seek a presidential second term if they do not cut unemployment
French President Francois Hollande has said they will not seek re-election in 2017 if they fail to cut unemployment .
In a televised interview , Mr Hollande acknowledged they had made mistakes since taking office in 2012 but vowed to go `` to the end '' to reform the economy .
The BBC 's Lucy Williamson in Paris says the interview is widely seen as an attempt by Mr Hollande to revive their flagging popularity .
Earlier on Thursday , a new poll put the president 's approval rating at 12 % .
Unemployment in France is currently at 11 % and economic growth has all but ground to a halt .
With Mr Hollande 's popularity at an all-time low , the far-right Front National led by Marine Le Pen has been making steady gains .
`` I 've got a thick skin . For two-and-a-half years I 've been hanging on , '' said Mr Hollande .
`` I have made mistakes . Who has n't ? ''
The BBC 's Lucy Williamson in Paris writes :
Bruised by personal scandal , with their popularity sunk to 12 % and a rebellion growing within their party , this was a key moment for Mr Hollande to reclaim some support .
At times nervous , frequently interrupting their challengers , they fielded questions from voters about their personal life , rising unemployment and France 's business environment . They had some tough debates , and announced some small initiatives to help those seeking work , but this felt more like an endurance test than a magic bullet .
The stakes , though , were high . France is beset by rising unemployment and high levels of debt , and Mr Hollande 's reforms have yet to bear fruit .
`` I am not deaf . I hear the anger . I see the dissatisfaction , and I have to go faster , '' they said .
Having been elected on a promise to boost employment , Mr Hollande admitted that jobs had not materialised and staked their political future on turning the situation around .
Voters 'unyielding '
Referring to their failed promise to `` invert the trend '' of unemployment , they said : `` Do you think I can say to the French people , ' I did n't manage it for five years , but I promise I 'll do it in the next five ? ' It does n't work like that .
`` If I do n't manage it before the end of my term , do you think I will go before the French people in 2017 ? The French people would be unyielding and they would be right . ''
However , Mr Hollande vowed to go `` to the end to reform France ... to make it stronger in the two and a half years I have left '' .
They also promised that from next year there would be no additional tax `` on anyone '' .
The president was questioned in the live TV programme by journalists and members of the public .
At one point a business person chided them for using overly official language , telling them to `` speak French '' .

Canadian senator and former UN Lieutenant-General Romeo Dallaire was honoured Wednesday by the U.S . Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington for their efforts to save lives during the genocide in Rwanda two decades ago .
Dallaire , now a Canadian Senator , was conferred the museum 's highest honour , the Elie Wiesel Award , at a tribute dinner for “ his valiant attempts to warn the world and prevent the 1994 Rwandan genocide , ” according to a notice on the museum 's website .
Dallaire served as commander of the ill-fated UN peacekeeping mission to the African country prior to and during the 1994 , and watched helplessly as mass killings took place .
“ General Dallaire did their utmost to warn the United Nations of the potential outbreak of large-scale ethnic violence , ” the museum said . “ Even when their warnings went unheeded , they refused to give in to international apathy . They continually called for use of force , and although unable to stop the atrocities , they and their unit nevertheless managed to protect more than 30,000 lives . ”
Dallaire has spoken publicly in the past about their struggle with depression and Post-Traumatic Stress disorder upon their return from Rwanda , where 800,000 people were killed over a 100-day period .
In an interview with CTV News ' Paul Workman Wednesday , Dallaire called the award an “ encouragement ” but said collectively , “ we failed ” the victims of the genocide in Rwanda .
“ There 's just no way of saying ‘ I did the best I could , ' and carry on , ” Dallaire said . “ You ca n't do that with 800,000 bodies floating around . ”
Even with the passing of time , Dallaire said Rwanda still haunts him .
“ Because you lived it , you still essentially can relive it , ” they said . `` There are mornings I wake up and I swear , I 'm in the middle of the damn genocide . ”
Appointed to the Senate in 2005 , Dallaire continues to advocate for genocide prevention and for the eradication of child soldiers .
As a Senator , they have visited the troubled region of Darfur as a member of a special advisory team .
Dallaire was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2002 . They have also received the inaugural Aegis Award for Genocide Prevention .
Their book , entitled “ Shake Hands with the Devil : The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda , ” was awarded the Governor General 's Literary Award for Non-Fiction in 2004 .
Named after a Jewish-American Nobel Peace Prize recipient , the Elie Wiesel Award recognizes prominent individuals who have “ advanced the Museum 's vision of a world where people confront hatred , prevent genocide , and promote human dignity , ” according to the museum 's website . It was established in 2011 .
Just to give perspective on this incredible murder by government , if all these bodies were laid head to toe , with the average height being 5 ' , then they would circle the earth ten times . Also , this democide murdered 6 times more people than died in combat in all the foreign and internal wars of the century . Finally , given popular estimates of the dead in a major nuclear war , this total democide is as though such a war did occur , but with its dead spread over a century .

Given the extent and detail of these books , the reader may be surprised that the primary purpose was not to describe democide itself , but to determine its nature and amount in order to test the theory that democracies are inherently nonviolent . They should have no wars between them , the least foreign violence and government related or directed domestic violence ( revolutions , coups , guerrilla war , and the like ) , and relatively little domestic democide . I have substantiated the war , foreign , and domestic violence parts of this theory in previous works 3 and took up the research associated with this book and its three predecessors in order to test the democide component . As will be seen , the results here clearly and decisively show that democracies commit less democide than other regimes . These results also well illustrate the principle underlying all my findings on war , collective violence , and democide , which is that the less freedom people have the more violence , the more freedom the less violence . I put this here as the Power Principle : power kills , absolute power kills absolutely .
In developing the statistics for this and the previous three volumes , almost 8,200 estimates of war , domestic violence , genocide , mass murder , and other relevant data , were recorded from over a thousand sources . I then did over 4,200 consolidations and calculations on these estimates and organized everything into tables of estimates , calculations , and sources totaling more than 18,100 rows . My intent is to be as explicit and public as possible so that others can evaluate , correct , and build on this work . I give the appendices for the Soviet , Chinese , and Nazi democide in my books on them . The appendices for this book were too massive to include here ( one appendix table alone amounts to over 50 pages ) and are given in a supplementary volume titled Statistics of Democide . I also include therein the details and results of various kinds of multivariate analysis of this democide and related data .
Then what is covered here ? This book presents the primary results , tables , and figures , and most important , an historical sketch of the major cases of democide -- those in which 1,000,000 or more people were killed by a regime . The first chapter is the summary and conclusion of this work on democide , and underlines the roles of democracy and power . Following this , chapter 2 in Part 1 introduces the new concept of democide . It defines and elaborates it , shows that democide subsumes genocidal killing , as well as the concepts of politicide and mass murder , and then tries to anticipate questions that the concept may arouse . It argues that democide is for the killing by government definitionally similar to the domestic crime of murder by individuals , and that murderer is an appropriate label for those regimes that commit democide . Readers that are satisfied with the thumbnail definition of democide as murder by government , including genocidal killing , 4 can ignore this chapter . It is essential , however , for those with a professional interest in the results or wish to question the conclusions .
Following this chapter is a rough sketch of democide before the 20th century . Although hardly any historical accounting has been done for genocide and mass murder , as for the Amerindians slaughtered by European colonists or Europeans massacred during the Thirty Years War , a number of specific democidal events and episodes can be described with some historical accuracy and a description of these provides perspective on 20th century democide . I have in mind particularly the human devastation wrought by the Mongols , the journey of death by slaves from capture through transportation to the Old and New Worlds , the incredible bloodletting of the Taiping Rebellion , and the infamous Paris executions and relatively unknown genocide of the French Revolution . The upshot of this chapter is to show that democide has been very much a part of human history and that in some cases , even without the benefit of modern killing technology and implementing bureaucracy , people were beheaded , stabbed , or sliced to death by the hundreds of thousands within a short duration . In some cities captured by the Mongols , for example , they allegedly massacred over 1,000,000 men , women , and children .
Parts 2 to 4 present all the regimes murdering 1,000,000 or more people in this century , a chapter on each . These are written so as to show which regime committed what democide , how and why . The emphasis is on the connection between a regime , its intentions , and its democide . Although each of the case studies drives toward some final accounting of the democide , the specifics of such figures and the nature and problems in the statistics are ignored . These are rather dealt with in each appendix to a case study ( given in Statistics of Democide ) , where each table of estimates , sources , and calculations is preceded by a detailed discussion of the estimates and the manner in which the totals were determined . The historical description of a case given here is only meant to provide an understanding of the democide . For this reason many specific examples will be given of the kind and nature of a regime 's killing . I have generally avoided , however , tales of brutal torture and savage killing unless such were useful to illustrate an aspect of the democide .
These chapters are ordered from the greatest of these killers to the lesser ones , as one can see from the table of contents . Part 2 presents the four deka-megamurderers , beginning with a chapter on the Soviet Union 's near 61,000,000 murdered , then including chapters on Communist China and Nazi Germany , and ending with a chapter on the now virtually unremembered killing of the Chinese Nationalist regime . Since these four regimes were the subjects of the previous three volumes , 5 the four chapters simply summarize the democide and conclusions . I hope I will be excused for using Greek prefixes for labeling these regimes ( deka- means ten or tens ; mega- means a million ) , but we need concepts for the various levels of government murder and there is no comparable English term ( `` murderer of tens of millions '' is clumsy ) .
Part 3 presents in order the lesser-megamurders , those that have killed 1,000,000 to less than 10,000,000 citizens and foreigners . A chapter also is devoted to each . In some cases , as for Poland 's murder of ethnic Germans and Reichdeutsch , a whole series of events spanning several countries was covered . In this case Poland 's treatment of these Germans was part of a pattern of expulsion from Eastern Europe after World War II . In some cases also , several successive regimes for the same country had committed democide and these were therefore treated together , as for the Sihanouk , Lon Nol , Pol Pot , and Samrim regimes of Cambodia .
There were three regimes -- those of the Czar in Russia , North Korea 's , and Mexico 's from 1900 to 1920 -- for which the estimates were not sufficient in number or quality to make a final determination of their democide . What estimates there were total over 1,000,000 murdered , but I treat this total as only an indictment for murder . These three are described in Part 4 as suspected megamurders .
In summary chapter 1 and in each of the case studies I present democide totals of one sort or another . With the exception of those that are directly cited from other works , how have I determined these figures , such as that Khmer Rouge regime likely murdered 2,000,000 Cambodians ? The prior question is : how should these democide figures I give , totals or otherwise , by looked at ? As , with little doubt , wrong ! I would be amazed if future archival , historical research , and confessions of the perpetrators came up with this figure or one within 10 percent of it . Regimes and their agents often do not record all their murders and what they do record will be secret . Even , however , when such archives are available , such as after defeat in war , and they are kept by the most technologically advanced of regimes with a cultural propensity for record keeping and obedience to authority , and a bureaucratic apparatus doing the murders systematically , the total number of victims can not be agreed upon . Consider that even after all the effort over forty-five years by the best scholars of the Holocaust to count how many Jews were killed by the Nazis , even with total access to surviving documents in the Nazi archives and the first-hand reports of survivors and participants , the difference between the lowest and highest of the best estimates is still 41 percent . 6
All the totals and figures in this book should therefore be viewed as rough approximations , as suggestive of an order of magnitude . This gross uncertainty then creates a rhetorical problem . How does one assert consistently and throughout a book such as this that each democide figure , as of the Khmer Rough having killed 2,000,000 Cambodians , is really a numerical haze -- that we do not know the true total and that it may be instead 600,000 or even 3,000,000 that they killed ? Except in cases where it is difficult to assert without qualification a specific figure ( as in the chapter titles ) , or space and form do not allow a constant repetition of ranges , as in the summary chapter , I will give the probable range of democide and then assert a `` most likely '' ( or `` probable '' or `` conservative '' ) mid-estimate . Thus , I will conclude in chapter 9 that the Khmer Rouge likely killed from 600,000 to 3,000,000 of their people , probably 2,000,000 ( this mid-value is simply a subjective probability and will be discussed shortly ) . All the appendices will develop and discuss such a range . For sub-totals in the historical description of a case I usually simply mention the mid-value , qualified as mentioned .
The how and why of an alleged democide range then is critical and it is not determined casually . Now , I have elsewhere published the methods that I use 7 to assess the democide of a regime , and should point out here summarily that this is an attempt to bracket the unknown and precisely unknowable democide by seeking a variety of published estimates , and most important , the highest and lowest ones from pro and anti-government sources . 8 I then consolidated these for different aspects of a regime 's democide , such as for summary executions , prison deaths , or disappearances , into low to high ranges . To get an overall range for a regime , as of that for the Khmer Rouge , I then sum all the consolidated lows to get an overall low democide , the consolidated highs to get an overall high .
The value of this approach lies in the great improbability that the sum of all the lowest estimates for a regime would be above the true total ; or that the sum of all the highs would be below it . The fundamental methodological hypothesis here is then that the low and high sums ( or the lowest low and highest high where such sums can not be calculated ) bracket the actual democide . This of course may be wrong for some events ( like a massacre ) , an episode ( like land reform ) , or an institution ( like re-education camps ) , but across the years and the many different kinds of democide committed by a regime , the actual democide should be bracketed .
Within this range of possible democide , I always seek a mid-range prudent or conservative estimate . This is based on my reading of the events involved , the nature of the different estimates , and the estimates of professionals who have long studied the country or government involved . I have sought in each case the best works in English on the relevant events so that I would not only have their estimates along with the others , but that their work would guide my choice of a prudent overall estimate . The details of this effort for each case is given in the relevant appendix in the related volume , Statistics of Democide .
Given my admission that I can only come within some range of an actual democide , a range that may vary from low to high by thousands of percent , why then will I so precisely specify a democide ? For example , in the chapter for communist China I will give the range of its democide as 5,999,000 to 102 , 671,000 , most likely 35 , 236,000 people killed . Why such apparent and misleading accuracy ? Why not simply make the range 5,000,000 to 105,000,000 , with a mid-value of 35,000,000 ? This I would like to do ( and have been urged by colleagues to do ) , but for many cases the democide figures result from calculations on or consolidations of a variety of estimates for different kinds of democide ( such as for `` land reform , '' labor camps , and the `` Cultural Revolution '' ) . When all calculations or consolidations are added together the sum comes out with such apparent precision . That is , the low and high and 35,236,000 mid-democide for communist China 's democide are sums . To then give other than these sums can create confusion between the discussion of the cases and the appendices in which the estimates and calculations are given in detail .
I handle this presentation problem in this way . Where specification of the final democide figures calculated in an appendix is necessary , as in a table , I give them with all their seeming exactitude . Where , however , such is unnecessary , I will then round off to the first or second digit and use some adjective such as `` near '' or `` around '' or `` about . '' Thus , communist China 's democide was about 35,000,000 .
After eight-years and almost daily reading and recording of men , women , and children by the tens of millions being tortured or beaten to death , hung , shot , and buried alive , burned or starved to death , stabbed or chopped into pieces , and murdered in all the other ways creative and imaginative human beings can devise , I have never been so happy to conclude a project . I have not found it easy to read time and time again about the horrors innocent people have been forced to suffer . What has kept me at this was the belief , as preliminary research seemed to suggest , that there was a positive solution to all this killing and a clear course of political action and policy to end it . And the results verify this . The problem is Power . The solution is democracy . The course of action is to foster freedom .
Former CIA director James Woolsey on Nov. 19 , 2008 , in Washington , D.C. Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images
Former CIA director James Woolsey resigned from the Trump transition team Thursday , as the president-elect 's dismissive attitude towards the U.S. intelligence agencies and reported plan to overhaul America 's intelligence infrastructure heightened tensions between the CIA and Trump . Woolsey , who served as head of the CIA under Bill Clinton , was a senior adviser to the transition team after joining the Trump campaign in September . When they signed on last year , Woolsey lauded the then-Republican candidate for their support for military spending and their judgment , saying the former reality TV star “ seems willing to keep a secret and not to blab everything to the public and our opponents. ” Despite their decades of experience , according to the Washington Post , Woolsey was increasingly sidelined by Trump and soon-to-be national security adviser , Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn .
From the Post :
[ People close to Woolsey ] said that Woolsey had grown increasingly uncomfortable lending their name and credibility to the transition team without being consulted . Woolsey was taken aback by this week 's reports that Trump is considering revamping the country 's intelligence framework , said these people , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly . … The person close to Woolsey described them as having chafed at Trump 's loose style on Twitter . They described Woolsey as a “ very principled ” diplomat who takes care to communicate the right message with just the right words .
“ Effective immediately , Ambassador Woolsey is no longer a Senior Advisor to President-Elect Trump or the Transition . They wish the President-Elect and their Administration great success in their time in office , ” a spokesperson for Woolsey said in a statement Wednesday .
Woolsey 's announcement comes amidst an increasingly tense standoff between the incoming administration and the intelligence community that continues to piece together the case that shows how and to what extent Russia meddled in the U.S. election . On Thursday , intelligence sources said they had identified the link between the Russian-backed hack of the DNC and WikiLeaks . “ Those and other data points are at the heart of an unprecedented intelligence report being circulated in Washington this week that details the evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and catalogues other cyber operations by Moscow against U.S. election systems over the past nine years , ” the Post reports . “ The classified document , which officials said is over 50 pages , was delivered to President Obama on Thursday , and it is expected to be presented to Trump in New York on Friday by the nation 's top spy officials , including Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and CIA Director John Brennan . ”
There is a behind the scenes shakeup on Freeform 's fantasy series Shadowhunters . Ed Decter , who developed for television the adaptation of The Mortal Instruments novels and served as executive producer in Season 1 , has abruptly exited the series , which was renewed for a second season in March . There is no replacement yet .

I hear Decter departed a few days ago and was not present at today 's first table read for Shadowhunters ‘ second season . I hear the departure was over creative differences , and the new showrunner ( s ) are expected to tweak the series ' creative direction for Season 2 . In the meanwhile , production is expected to continue as scheduled , with no impact from Decter 's exit .
The development was unexpected . At the time of Shadowhunters Season 1 finale in April , Decter spoke at length about their Season 2 plans for the show in a number of interviews .
Shadowhunters has been a buzzy show for Freeform , recently winning two Teen Choice Awards . After a highly-rated series premiere , there were a ratings dropoff but the series quickly stabilized and was relatively steady for most of its first-year student run .
I am ashamed to be even be writing this review but I feel I must do it . I never even heard of these types of toys before . I dont watch porn or look at it or look at weird nasty internet porn . This journey began again with my best friend who is a redneck man who lives in Texas who drinks and smokes pot . I have known them since I was 15 . They were my first boyfriend . They had a serious surgery months ago and it caused them to not be able to rise from to the occasion . Well this started to turn into a hysteria for him . They became depressed . men are so so just retarded I should saY . Anyway , they brain washed themselves into thinking they would never get a woman again and they would not be able to be a porn star in the bedroom . As if women even want that ? No we dont . So I researched and found these flesh tube cans and as a JOKE sent them one . Bad mistake ! Within 1 month they had ordered 5 different styles ordered a catalouge and they then discovered c-ock rings , other toys and then I would not speak to him . They had a crock pot in their room to warm these things and it got out of control . Finally I convinced them to throw them away . The dumb redneck now finding their erection was not lost to put them all in a box and taped it up and threw it in their truck , it was stolen in the parking lot of walmart ! The shame . The horror . The hilarity . The surprised look on the crook who stole the box . So my redneck friend rates these devices very highly except they fall apart very fast and they are addictive and weird and they make your sausage bigger blah blah . These toys I have managed to know nothing about and now I AM stained for life with the image of a drunk redneck wildy going at this can tube . This further confirms my guess that men are perverts . anyway yeah great product whoo hooo whatever !
A transgender activist is trying to silence the Catholic Church in the Australian state of Tasmania on the issues of homosexuality , transgender and same-sex marriage .
Martine Delaney , who will be a Greens candidate for the next Federal election , has lodged a complaint with the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Commission over a booklet produced by Australia 's Catholic bishops , “ Do n't Mess with Marriage. ” It was distributed in Tasmania by the Archbishop of Hobart , Julian Porteous , to the parents of students in Catholic schools . The two parties have just announced that they will attend a conciliation conference .
In a lengthy press release Delaney said that the booklet only pays lip service to respect for same-sex-attracted Australians by insisting that they should be treated with “ respect , sensitivity , and love. ” But they interpret these as weasel words . They say :
Despite the assertion it 's respectful , this booklet says same-sex partners do n't deserve equal recognition , same-sex-attracted people are not ‘ whole ' people and the children of same-sex partners are not ‘ healthy . ' By spreading this message , the Church does immeasurable harm to the well-being of same-sex couples and their families across Tasmania and the nation — particularly those who are students , teachers or parents within the Catholic education system . ”
Tasmania 's Anti-Discrimination Act was amended in 2012 ( when the Greens Party was the junior partner in a coalition government with the Labor Party ) and became the harshest in the nation . Under its controversial Section 17 , offending , humiliating or insulting another person because of sexual orientation is prohibited .
Delaney says that the booklet offends , humiliates and insults same-sex attracted people and their children .
How ? “ Respect , sensitivity , and love ” sound more like love-bombing than vilification . That does n't matter in Tasmania . The test is whether Delaney feels offended , not whether the offense is reasonable . In fact , turning up the dial on respect , sensitivity , and love could be construed as being offensively condescending .
“ Do n't Mess with Marriage ” is a carefully phrased , sober presentation of traditional Catholic teaching on homosexuality . So it 's not a matter of removing insulting phrases : there are n't any . So if Delaney 's complaint succeeds , Archbishop Porteous has three options : to preach acceptance of homosexuality , to say absolutely nothing about homosexuality , or to suffer the penalties imposed by the government .
All because Delaney feels offended . And not reasonably offended , either . Here is what has insulted them
The booklet refers to “ same-sex friendships ” but denies that there can be same-sex conjugal unions . “ I can think of few more negatives and demoralizing messages than to be told you have no hope of a lifelong , loving union , ” Delaney says . “ It is far worse than to be called a derogatory term based on your sexuality or gender identity. ” If an idea which gives them a headache is worse than spiteful language , free speech is really in trouble .
The booklet says that the complementary union of a man and a woman makes them “ whole ” . “ This obviously implies same-sex attracted people can never be whole people , “ says Delaney . Actually , it is not “ obvious ” at all . Eleven people form a whole soccer team , five a basketball team . The fact that a basketball team can never play as a soccer team does not imply that the basketballers are not “ whole people ” .
The booklet states that marriage is “ the nursery of healthy , well rounded virtuous citizens ” and research shows that a mother and a father are necessary for a child 's development . Once again , Delaney finds offense in their own inferences , not in the words of the booklet . They write : “ These statements are offensive , humiliating and insulting to the children of same-sex couples , because together they say these children are not as healthy , virtuous or as well developed as other children , simply because of the gender of their parents . ”
The booklet states that marriage is “ fundamental good , a foundation of human existence ” and that it is associated with “ social stability ” . Delaney 's deconstruction of this is hilarious : “ It demonizes us ” . If this is the case , perhaps they should drag the United Nations before the Anti-Discrimination Commission because of the offense , humiliation and insult implied in Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights : “ Men and women of full age … have the right to marry and to found a family . ”
And , finally , when Delaney fails to unearth objectively offensive language in the booklet , they appeal to what that eminent Melbourne jurist Danny Denuto , of the film The Castle , called “ the vibe… of the thing ” — “ the booklet only states it is respectful . The overall message in the booklet is exactly the opposite . ”
Tasmania 's Anti-Discrimination Act is seriously flawed , as even Melbourne 's Human Rights Law Centre acknowledged when it was amended in 2012 . It said that “ the words ‘ offends ' and ‘ insults ' are too low a threshold for vilification laws like these ” . If Ms Delaney succeeds , it will be a blow to free speech throughout Australia .
The New South Wales Minister for Finance , Dominic Perrottet , had advice for Archbishop Porteous : “ He should stop apologising . This is their point of view and no one else has to agree with him . They should not regret saying it just because some people have chosen to take offense . If they disagree , they should engage in debate . That is how free societies work . ”
An adverse judgement by the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal could even cripple Australia 's upcoming debate on same-sex marriage . “ The position outlined by the Catholic Bishop 's Conference is the position that had been taken by every leader of the two major political parties right up until last year — and it is now potentially illegal , ” says Simon Breheny , of the Institute of Public Affairs . “ The legitimacy of the result in the upcoming plebiscite depends upon the existence of a free and open debate . Both sides must have the opportunity to present a case to the Australian people , ”
What can the Catholic Church in Tasmania do ?
Fight Delaney in the courts , obviously .
But if this fails , there is the nuclear option : a counter-strike against MONA , the recently-opened Museum of Old and New Art , which has quickly become the second most popular tourist attraction in Tasmania , thanks in part to the enthusiastic support of the state government .
MONA 's mission is to be is offensive , “ a subversive adult Disneyland ” , as its founder , gambler David Walsh has described it . And one of the main pieces in their collection is “ The Holy Virgin Mary ” by Chris Ofili , a British artist . New York 's former mayor Rudi Giuliani described it as “ sick ” and “ disgusting ” , which it is .
The Madonna is surrounded by butterflies which , on closer inspection , are photographs of female genitalia . A lump of dried , varnished elephant dung forms one bared breast . Surely this falls under Section 19 of the Anti-Discrimination Act , which prohibits “ hatred towards , serious contempt for , or severe ridicule of … religious belief or affiliation or religious activity. ” To anyone in the Catholic tradition , “ The Holy Virgin Mary ” constitutes “ severe ridicule . ”
Archbishop Porteous should see whether the Anti-Discrimination Commission has the courage to be even-handed in enforcing the state 's absurdly draconian law .

The Genius Inside You : Unlocking the Brain 's Drive to Mastery
Robert Greene Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 8 , 2013
If all of us are born with an essentially similar brain , with more or less the same configuration and potential for mastery , why is it then that in history only a limited number of people seem to truly excel and realize this potential power ?
The common explanations for a Mozart or a Leonardo da Vinci revolve around natural talent and brilliance . How else to account for their uncanny achievements except in terms of something they were born with ? But thousands upon thousands of children display exceptional skill and talent in some field , yet relatively few of them ever amount to anything , whereas those who are less brilliant in their youth can often attain much more . Natural talent or a high IQ can not explain future achievement .
As a classic example , compare the lives of Sir Francis Galton and their older cousin , Charles Darwin . By all accounts , Galton was a super-genius with an exceptionally high IQ , quite a bit higher than Darwin 's ( these are estimates done by experts years after the invention of the measurement ) . Galton was a boy wonder who went on to have an illustrious scientific career , but they never quite mastered any of the fields they went into . They were notoriously restless , as is often the case with child prodigies .
Darwin , by contrast , is rightly celebrated as the superior scientist , one of the few who has forever changed our view of life . As Darwin themselves admitted , they are :
“ a very ordinary boy , rather below the common standard in intellect . . . .I have no great quickness of apprehension . . . .My power to follow along and purely abstract train of thought is very limited. ” Darwin , however , must have possessed something that Galton lacked .
In many ways , a look at the early life of Darwin themselves can supply an answer to this mystery . As a child Darwin had one overriding passion— collecting biological specimens . Their father , a doctor , wanted them to follow in their footsteps and study medicine , enrolling them at the University of Edinburgh . Darwin did not take to this subject and was a mediocre student . Their father , despairing that their son would ever amount to anything , chose for them a career in the church . As Darwin was preparing for this , a former professor of theirs told them that the HMS Beagle was to leave port soon to sail around the world , and that it needed a ship 's biologist to accompany the crew in order to collect specimens that could be sent back to England . Despite their father 's protests , Darwin took the job . Something in them was drawn to the voyage .
Suddenly , their passion for collecting found its perfect outlet . In South America they could collect the most astounding array of specimens , as well as fossils and bones . They could connect their interest in the variety of life on the planet with something larger—major questions about the origins of species . They poured all of their energy into this enterprise , accumulating so many specimens that a theory began to take shape in their mind . After five years at sea , they returned to England and devoted the rest of their life to the single task of elaborating their theory of evolution . In the process they had to deal with a tremendous amount of drudgery—for instance , eight years exclusively studying barnacles to establish their credentials as a biologist . They had to develop highly refined political and social skills to handle all the prejudice against such a theory in Victorian England . And what sustained them throughout this lengthy process was their intense love of and connection to the subject .
The basic elements of this story are repeated in the lives of all of the great Masters in history from Henry Ford to Mozart : a youthful passion or predilection , a chance encounter that allows them to discover how to apply it , an apprenticeship in which they come alive with energy and focus . They excel by their ability to practice harder and move faster through the process , all of this stemming from the intensity of their desire to learn and from the deep connection they feel to their field of study . And at the core of this intensity of effort is in fact a quality that is genetic and inborn—not talent or brilliance , which is something that must be developed , but rather a deep and powerful inclination toward a particular subject .
This inclination is a reflection of a person 's uniqueness . This uniqueness is not something merely poetic or philosophical—it is a scientific fact that genetically , every one of us is unique ; our exact genetic makeup has never happened before and will never be repeated .
This uniqueness is revealed to us through the preferences we innately feel for particular activities or subjects of study . Such inclinations can be toward music or mathematics , certain sports or games , solving puzzle-like problems , tinkering and building , or playing with words .
With those who stand out by their later mastery , they experience this inclination more deeply and clearly than others . They experience it as an inner calling . It tends to dominate their thoughts and dreams . They find their way , by accident or sheer effort , to a career path in which this inclination can flourish . This intense connection and desire allows them to withstand the pain of the process—the self-doubts , the tedious hours of practice and study , the inevitable setbacks , the endless barbs from the envious . They develop a resiliency and confidence that others lack .
In our culture we tend to equate thinking and intellectual powers with success and achievement . In many ways , however , it is an emotional quality that separates those who master a field from the many who simply work at a job . Our levels of desire , patience , persistence , and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers . Feeling motivated and energized , we can overcome almost anything . Feeling bored and restless , our minds shut off and we become increasingly passive .
In the past , only elites or those with an almost superhuman amount of energy and drive could pursue a career of their choice and master it . A man was born into the military , or groomed for the government , chosen among those of the right class . If they happened to display a talent and desire for such work it was mostly a coincidence . Millions of people who were not part of the right social class , gender , and ethnic group were rigidly excluded from the possibility of pursuing their calling . Even if people wanted to follow their inclinations , access to the information and knowledge pertaining to that particular field was controlled by elites . That is why there are relatively few Masters in the past and why they stand out so much .
These social and political barriers , however , have mostly disappeared . Today we have the kind of access to information and knowledge that past Masters could only dream about . Now more than ever , we have the capacity and freedom to move toward the inclination that all of us possess as part of our genetic uniqueness . It is time that the word “ genius ” becomes demystified and de-rarefied . We are all closer than we think to such intelligence . ( The word “ genius ” comes from the Latin , and originally referred to a guardian spirit that watched over the birth of each person ; it later came to refer to the innate qualities that make each person uniquely gifted . )
Although we may find ourselves at a historical moment rich in possibilities for mastery , in which more and more people can move toward their inclinations , we in fact face one last obstacle in obtaining such power , one that is cultural and insidiously dangerous : The very concept of mastery has become denigrated , associated with something old-fashioned and even unpleasant . It is generally not seen as something to aspire to . This shift in value is rather recent , and can be traced to circumstances peculiar to our times .
If we do n't try too much in life , if we limit our circle of action , we can give ourselves the illusion of control . The less we attempt , the fewer chances of failure . If we can make it look like we are not really responsible for our fate , for what happens to us in life , then our apparent powerlessness is more palatable . For this reason we become attracted to certain narratives : it is genetics that determines much of what we do ; we are just products of our times ; the individual is just a myth ; human behavior can be reduced to statistical trends .
The idea that they might have to expend much effort to get what they want has been eroded by the proliferation of devices that do so much of the work for them , fostering the idea that they deserve all of this—that it is their inherent right to have and to consume what they want . “ Why bother working for years to attain mastery when we can have so much power with very little effort ? Technology will solve everything. ” This passivity has even assumed a moral stance : “ mastery and power are evil ; they are the domain of patriarchal elites who oppress us ; power is inherently bad ; better to opt out of the system altogether , ” or at least make it look that way .
If you are not careful , you will find this attitude infecting you in subtle ways . You will unconsciously lower your sights as to what you can accomplish in life . This can diminish your levels of effort and discipline below the point of effectiveness . Conforming to social norms , you will listen more to others than to your own voice .
Before it is too late you must find your way to your inclination , exploiting the incredible opportunities of the age that you have been born into . Knowing the critical importance of desire and of your emotional connection to your work , which are the keys to mastery , you can in fact make the passivity of these times work in your favor and serve as a motivating device in two important ways .
First , the world is teeming with problems , many of them of our own creation . To solve them will require a tremendous amount of effort and creativity . Relying on genetics , technology , magic , or being nice and natural will not save us . We require the energy not only to address practical matters , but also to forge new institutions and orders that fit our changed circumstances . We must create our own world or we will die from inaction
Second , you must convince yourself of the following : people get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve through their actions in life . Despite the popularity of genetic explanations for our behavior , recent discoveries in neuroscience are overturning long-held beliefs that the brain is genetically hardwired . Scientists are demonstrating the degree to which the brain is actually quite plastic—how our thoughts determine our mental landscape . They are exploring the relationship of willpower to physiology , how profoundly the mind can affect our health and functionality .
People who are passive create a mental landscape that is rather barren . Because of their limited experiences and action , all kinds of connections in the brain die off from lack of use . Pushing against the passive trend of these times , you must work to see how far you can extend control of your circumstances and create the kind of mind you desire—not through drugs but through action .
Unleashing the masterful mind within , you will be at the vanguard of those who are exploring the extended limits of human willpower .
In moving toward mastery , you are bringing your mind closer to reality and to life itself . Anything that is alive is in a continual state of change and movement . The moment that you rest , thinking that you have attained the level you desire , a part of your mind enters a phase of decay . You lose your hard-earned creativity and others begin to sense it . This is a power and intelligence that must be continually renewed or it will die .

Third-party Steam Machine manufacturer Alienware will launch its SteamOS-ready gaming PC , the Alpha Steam Machine , in time for this holiday season beginning at $ 549 with a Xbox 360 controller , the company announced during E3 2014 today .
But technically this wo n't really be a Steam Machine . That 's because SteamOS is n't quite ready . Instead this system will run Windows 8.1 and a graphic user interface created in-house by Dell for Alienware . That interface will allow players to skip the standard Windows view and hop into Steam 's Big Picture mode .
While the machine will ship with Windows installed , users can choose to install the SteamOS beta . Once the full SteamOS rolls out , Alienware will offer instructions throughout the update process `` to make it turnkey and that `` It 's not that complicated a process . ''
`` We do n't want to force people to do it so we do n't want to , '' Azor said . `` The fact that it is based on Windows it naturally ends up more expensive . When we launch SteamOS the price point will go down . ''
The Alpha , roughly about the size of a Wii U , will include a receiver compartment for the Steam Pad but will ship with an Xbox 360 controller . `` We considered and could have designed a gamepad ourselves , but that 's for the Steam Gamepad , '' Azor said . `` Lets leverage gamepads that people love out there instead of forcing people to reinvest . ''
The machine sports two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 ports , optical audio out and 500GB SATA 3 HDD . The Alienware Alpha can be configured with an Intel Core i5 & i7 ‘ Haswell ' based processors , 8GB DDR3 at 1600MHz dual-channel Memory , dual-band Wireless-AC 2x2 with Bluetooth 4.0 and 1TB and 2TB SATA 3 HDD .
The Alienware Alpha features Alienware Alpha Console-mode user interface , Intel Core i3 ‘ Haswell ' based processor , 4GB DDR3 at 1600MHz memory and a custom-built NVIDIA `` Maxwell '' based GPU , with 2GB of dedicated GDDR5 high-speed memory . Connectivity features include dual-band wireless-AC 1x1 with Bluetooth 4.0 , DMI Out : uncompressed 8 channel audio and support for 4k content , HDMI In : Direct HDMI pass-through and gigabit ethernet .
Alienware stated during CES earlier this year that it plans to price its offering very competitively with Sony 's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft 's Xbox One . Its most important design goal , according to Alienware global marketing director Bryan De Zayas , was creating a Steam Machine that 's small enough to disappear in living room set ups , while still maintaining the company 's build and performance standards .
`` We are definitely getting into the console business , '' Azor told Polygon . `` We are brought to you a deffer type of game . But we are not trying to build another box to play Call of Duty or Battlefield , there are great solutions out there to play other games . Xbox , PlayStation and PC are phenomenal solutions to play those games . ''
Stanford has confirmed earlier reports that defensive tackle Terrence Stephens will miss the upcoming game against UCLA to remain on campus and “ take care of a personal matter . ”
The senior from Gaithersburg , Md. , is a big part of the Cardinal 's interior defense , starting seven of the team 's 11 games this season and all 13 last year . This year they have 10 total tackles , three tackles for a loss and a sack . They had a career-high five tackles , including two for a loss , and a sack in Stanford 's win over Oregon State two weeks ago .
Junior David Parry is the listed backup at nose guard and will likely fill Stephens place , although Stephens was still listed on the team 's depth chart as the projected starter as of Wednesday night . Parry did not see action as a first-year student but was Stephens ' backup last season and recorded six tackles in limited action .
Stanford must beat the Bruins this weekend , or else hope Oregon loses to Oregon State , in order to secure a berth in the Pac-12 Championship Game as the Pac-12 North Division champion . The Cardinal would then host UCLA again next Friday night from Stanford Stadium with a Rose Bowl invitation on the line .
The Brit caused controversy in the F1 season finale when they elected to slow Rosberg in to the chasing pack in the hope that other cars would overtake their rival and help their own championship cause .
Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff said after the race that Hamilton 's defiance of team orders to speed up was not ideal , as they pondered a possible rethink of racing protocol for 2017 .
But with the Hamilton issue having now been put on the backburner in the wake of Rosberg 's shock decision to retire , Lowe has revealed a few more details about what happened .
They say that after Hamilton ignored an instruction from them to speed up , Wolff asked whether Lowe should repeat the order .
“ When I told Lewis to speed up , the next debate on the pitwall came from Toto – 'tell them again , they have n't done it ! ' ” said Lowe , speaking on stage at the Autosport Awards . “ So , I said ‘ no , because then I will look like a complete pillock if I do that again ! '
“ James [ Vowles ] who sits to my right is actually the most fantastic strategist , but it did n't compute with them that the driver was n't going at the right speed . So they were struggling with that – and said ‘ make them speed up or the graph shows we will lose . '
“ So the conversation I was having , was – 'do n't you think once they see the red car in the mirror they might put the throttle down a bit harder ? ' So we were having our own debates . I put a marker down . ”
Although the issue was a big talking point at the time , Lowe said that the situation was ultimately a good one for the team and F1 .
“ I think it was a great race result , a great ending not only for the team but for the sport as a whole – that will have really brought new fans to the sport , ” they said . “ So it was a fantastic result even though I told Lewis to speed up .
“ I think it was fine what happened . It is worth remembering in Monaco that we told Nico to let Lewis past and that was my other team instruction of the year , and they did that within one corner . So that is just for a bit of balance that is worth thinking about it . ”
Contract talks
Lowe 's own future at Mercedes has been the subject of intense speculation over recent weeks , but they moved to make clear that there was no ulterior motive behind a decision to wait until the end of the year to finalise details of a new contract .
“ I gather that is out there that there has been a debate on that subject , ” they said about questions regarding their future .
“ I 've been with Mercedes for 22 years now , either working for them or with them , so I have got no reason to see why that should change . It is going very well .
`` Toto and I had a discussion that , let 's wait until the end of the season and get that out of the way , and we will take it from there . ”
Media playback is not supported on this device Duckett actions trivial but unacceptable - Bayliss
Ben Duckett was dropped from Saturday 's Ashes tour game after pouring a drink over England bowler James Anderson in a Perth bar .
The 23-year-old batsman , part of the England Lions squad , was due to play against a Cricket Australia XI as a number of the senior party were rested .
On Thursday , they were socialising with Lions and senior squad members , who were not under a curfew .
`` It 's trivial , but in the current climate not acceptable , '' said coach Trevor Bayliss .
Anderson , who has played in 131 Tests , is England 's all-time leading wicket-taker and there is no suggestion the 35-year-old did anything wrong .
In September , England all-rounder and vice-captain Ben Stokes was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm after an altercation outside a Bristol nightclub .
Then , at the start of the Ashes tour , Jonny Bairstow was accused of 'headbutting ' Australia 's Cameron Bancroft in a Perth bar .
`` Everyone has been warned about how even small things can be blown out of all proportion , '' added Bayliss .
`` I 'm disappointed . With what we have had to go through already with these problems , it is not acceptable . ''
Duckett has been suspended pending a disciplinary investigation that will be led by Lions coach Andy Flower .
`` Andy will look after their player and if anything needs to be said or done with the first team , we 'll handle that , '' added Australian Bayliss .
`` I 'm not sure what more I can say to the players . I 'm sure there will be some stern words from above . ''
Ben Duckett has been suspended pending a disciplinary investigation
When asked if they are `` fed up '' about having to address off-field matters , Bayliss replied : `` Very much so . I 'm here to coach the team and I end up spending most of the time trying to explain behaviour that the boys have been warned about . ''
The latest indiscretion involving the England team is thought to have left management incredibly angry .
There is a feeling trouble usually centres around the same small group of players and that they could pay with their place in the squad , even if that weakens the overall strength of the team .
`` I might review who is in the team , '' said Bayliss . `` They ca n't keep making the same mistakes .
`` Most of the guys are fine , but somewhere along the line some of the guys have to pull their heads in . ''

Northants left-hander Duckett averages 15.71 in four Tests for England , the last of which was against India in November 2016 .
They were replaced in the England team for the game at Richardson Park by Joe Clarke .
England are 2-0 down in the Ashes series and will relinquish the urn if they are beaten in the third Test in Perth , which begins on Thursday .
The Ashes squad had been placed under a curfew after the incident between Bairstow and Bancroft came to light during England 's 10-wicket defeat in the first Test in Brisbane .
Though both Bairstow and Bancroft described the occurrence as `` without malice '' , England 's players were subsequently required to return to their hotel by midnight .
That curfew was lifted for the first time on the night of Duckett 's indiscretion .
It is understood that no members of the public were involved and England team security were present .
ABC and NBC on Wednesday and Thursday ignored the highly suspicious news that Bill Clinton had a secret meeting earlier in the week with Attorney General Loretta Lynch . This as the Justice Department and the FBI are investigating Hillary Clinton 's private e-mail server . Only CBS bothered to cover the story .
To the credit of the journalists at CBS This Morning , they led the show with what would seem to be big news . At times , however , there was a credulous tone to the reporting . Co-host Charlie Rose assured , “ Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately this week with former President Bill Clinton at a Phoenix airport . Lynch says there was no discussion about the FBI probe . ”
Co-host Norah O'Donnell introduced a full report by parroting , “ Nancy Cordes looks at the meeting that aides say was an unplanned coincidence. ” Cordes added , “ That meeting took place as President Bill Clinton was leaving that Phoenix airport and Lynch arriving . They say they did not discuss the e-mail investigation . ”
Eventually , Cordes got around to skepticism :
NANCY CORDES : But even the impression of favoritism could hurt Lynch as their department investigates Hillary Clinton 's use of a private server as Secretary of State . Some Republicans have called for the appointment of a special proper . It even came up at Lynch 's confirmation hearing .
Later on the show , co-host Gayle King assured viewers that the secretive meeting was totally innocent . In addition to CBS This Morning , the network also covered the story on Wednesday 's Evening News . Guest anchor Josh Elliott offered a quick news brief : “ Lynch says the two did not discuss the investigation . ”
However , at least CBS covered the story . The NBC Nightly News and Today show both skipped it . This is despite four and a half hours of total air time . ABC 's World News Tonight and Good Morning America both did the same .
What happened to the supposed rough skepticism of journalists ?
A transcript of the segment is below :
The Toronto Zoo welcomed a slew of baby animals in the past few weeks while the zoo employees were on strike , including three snow leopards and a first for the zoo — a pair of clouded leopards .
The zoo reopened on Thursday after CUPE Local 1600 and the Toronto Zoo agreed to a deal after more than a month of striking by workers due to concerns over job security .
A little too cute for words . Our Toronto Zoo clouded leopard cubs are now starting to walk and meow , with eyes fully open at 21 days . < a href= '' https : //t.co/87l56nemLG '' > pic.twitter.com/87l56nemLG < /a > — @ TheTorontoZoo
The two clouded leopard cubs were born on May 13 to parents Pavarti and Mingma .
`` Pavarti is a first time mom and while they showed early signs of having maternal instincts , they started spending less time with their cubs and could not be observed nursing or mothering them , '' said the zoo staff in a statement .
The cubs spent their first few weeks in the intensive care unit at the zoo being taken care of by the zoo 's wildlife care staff .
On May 18 , three snow leopard cubs were born to mother , Ena , and father , Kota , as part of the zoo 's snow leopard conservation breeding program .
The zoo said Ena was showing `` incredible maternal instincts for a first time mom [ and ] all three cubs have been observed nursing very well . ''
Five cheetah cubs were born at the zoo at the end of April . ( Toronto Zoo )
On April 30 , before the zoo workers went on strike , five cheetah cubs were born to parent Laini and Patonga , bringing the total of cheetahs born at the zoo up to 53 .
`` Laini is doing a superb job of caring for their large litter – which is also their first , '' the zoo said .

The Toronto Zoo is participating in a clouded leopard , snow leopard and cheetah conservation breeding programs through the recommendation of the Species Survival Plan ( SSP ) , a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums , an organization based in the U.S. , to help ensure the survival of certain threatened species .
Tabulators , mostly retirees , are being paid $ 25 for each half day they work , and county officials say they would bring in workers as needed to count the 51,000 ballots in time .
In Wisconsin , recounts are not terribly unusual . Another vast statewide recount happened only four years ago , for a seat on the state 's Supreme Court . The recount took more than a month .
Michael Cotter , a staff member in the county clerk 's office , stood on the sidelines on Thursday morning and recalled at least three other recounts that they had taken part in , dating from a countywide do-over for a judicial seat in the spring of 2000 .
“ We had punch ballots back then , so I knew all about pregnant chads and hanging chads before Bush and Gore , ” they said . “ They kept falling out of the ballots and they were all over the floor , like confetti . ”
Election officials here seemed determined to keep the process orderly . Observers were told to stay several feet away from the tabulators , on one side of the room marked off by green tape . Donna Emelity , a tabulator , said they were volunteering out of a sense of civic duty . “ Wisconsin is run very honest , ” they said . “ I think it will prove to people that it 's an honest election and it 'll help people have more confidence . ”
Representatives of the campaigns were allowed to be closer to the process , peering over the shoulders of election officials as they tested machines and used pliers to snip open white plastic sacks of ballots .
Mary Gilding , a volunteer for the Stein campaign who was there to oversee the recount , said that they did not “ have a dog in this fight , ” but merely wanted to ensure that the election results were accurate .
On Saturday , the Satanic Temple of Los Angeles held their biggest event ever : a massive satanic mass , complete with a live bloodletting ritual . The purpose of the mass , according to the Satanic Temple 's website , was `` to inspire personal and societal liberation . '' The event , which was held in partnership with Das Bunker , doubled as a fundraiser for a number of causes including the women 's reproductive rights campaign , lawsuits concerning violations of the First Amendment , and providing education and assistance to individuals incarcerated in our for-profit prison system . Once attendees made it past the massive line to get in , there was live painting , and first-come-first-serve tattooing .
The event was essentially a goth/industrial show , with many attendees dressed in costume . There was a mosh pit and crowd surfing . There was a demonic cat lecture by Paul Koudounaris , and a destruction ritual , along with an invocation ritual . The invocation included a statement of principals of the Satanic Temple ( aka the Seven Tenets ) , including a call to question everything and standing up to racial and gender inequality , and ending with chants of `` Hail Satan . '' Coven of Ashes performed a bloodletting ritual , and the bands Lumerians , Author + Punisher , and 3Teeth performed .
Recap
The Bears ' playoff quest continued Friday night against the cellar-dwelling Hartford Wolf Pack . Early in the first , during an offensive rush , Bears forward Liam O'Brien crashed into Wolf Pack goaltender Jeff Malcolm which led to a Hartford powerplay . The Wolf Pack controlled possession throughout , but were not able to beat Phoenix Copley . After the powerplay concluded , Hartford continued to control the game , going up 9-2 in shots at the halfway mark of the first period .
Hershey would push back , getting some offensive zone time of their own and forcing Hartford winger Nicklas Jensen to take a holding penalty . However , the Bears were not able to capitalize , as they were held shotless .
After some back-and-forth play , Bears forward Chandler Stephenson was slashed on a breakaway , sending Hershey to their second powerplay with 48 seconds left in the first period . The period came to a close with Hartford leading in shots 10-5 .
The Bears opened the second period with 1:12 left on their powerplay , but were unable to get anything going . Just after the unsuccessful powerplay , the Bears took a penalty of their own , with Madison Bowey going to the box for cross-checking during a puck battle behind the Hershey net . Hartford would be held shotless , with the Bears getting their fair share of short-handed chances .
The path to the penalty box would be skated again shortly after , as Hartford 's Garrett Noonan would be penalized for interference .
Once again , Hershey was unsuccessful with the man-advantage , being held shotless .
The teams continued trading off powerplays , with the Bears ' Liam O'Brien going to the penalty box for the second time . This time , the Wolf Pack would capitalize . Matt Carey would beat Copley from in close to give Hartford the 1-0 lead midway through the second .
The Bears would not be down for long . Just under a minute later , Paul Carey would carry the puck in , passing it off to the trailing Christian Djoos , before getting it back and beating Jeff Malcolm to tie the score at 1 .
Soon after , the Bears would get a chance to build on their momentum , going on their fourth powerplay of the game as Adam Chapie would go off for tripping . However , the Bears could not capitalize and their powerplay would prove unsuccessful once again .
Hershey would rebound late in the second . After some offensive zone pressure , Paul Carey found Christian Djoos wide open in front of the net , where Djoos sneaked the puck under the arm of Malcolm to give the Bears a 2-1 lead with just 2 seconds left in the period .
5 minutes into the third period , Hartford 's Dan Catenacci sped into the zone and beat Phoenix Copley just over the glove-side pad , tying the game at 2 .
Again , Hershey would immediately respond as Garrett Mitchell deflected a Tom Gilbert wrist shot under the arm of Malcolm to regain Hershey 's lead . Christian Djoos would pick up a secondary assist on the goal , picking up their third point on the night .
With 4 minutes left , Hartford would respond ; Marek Hrivik blasted a shot off of Copley 's pad that bounced right to forward Nicklas Jensen . Jensen tapped it past Copley to tie the game at 3 .
After a few chances from both teams , regulation came to a close with the game tied at 3 .
With 2 huge points on the line , the Bears came out fast in the overtime period . On their second shift in overtime , Christian Djoos blasted a shot from the faceoff circle past Malcom to win the game for the Bears , 4-3 .
FINAL : Hershey Bears 4-3 OT
SHOTS : Hershey Bears 26-25
GAME REPORT
5 Thoughts
Christian Djoos continued their dominance over Hartford this season with a 4-point performance ( 2 goals , 2 assists ) . They now have 3 goals and 8 assists in 6 games against the Wolf Pack . Travis Boyd also continued their dominance over Hartford with 3 assists . They now have 3 goals and 7 assists versus Hartford . Stanislav Galiev extended their point streak to 6 games after picking up an assist on the game-winning goal . They have 4 goals and 5 assists during their point streak Madison Bowey returned to the Bears lineup for the first time since getting cut by a skate on December 28th . In their return , they had a bad turnover and a penalty , but it was overall a good first game back for the defenseman . With the Bridgeport Sound Tigers losing to the Providence Bruins tonight , Hershey moves into a playoff spot .
Looking Ahead
Hershey and Hartford are back at it at the Giant Center Saturday at 7pm . Hershey has now won 4 straight games against Hartford .
The Bears will be without top defenseman Madison Bowey ( rest ) . In coach Mann 's post-game interview , Mann said Bowey was 100 % but , “ He would play definitely one game , maybe two , ” during this 3-game weekend .
While the Bears will not have Bowey , they will add Jakub Vrana back to the lineup . Vrana has been up with the Capitals since mid-February .
The next scheduled Bears game for GNGHockey will be March 18 against Hartford .

“ Making a Murderer ” subject Steven Avery is blaming their defense attorneys for their conviction .
“ They did n't do their job , ” Avery said in an interview with InTouch that aired on “ Good Morning America. ” “ They were looking out for the state . ”
After “ Making a Murderer ” aired on Netflix , Avery got a new lawyer , Kathleen Zellner , who is preparing an appeal they hope will free them from the life sentence without parole they are serving in the murder of Teresa Halbach .

One way defendants can appeal is by contending they had inadequate representation , and Avery seems to be laying the groundwork for such a claim .
“ If they would do more investigating on the case , they would find all of this stuff , ” Avery said of their trial lawyers , Dean Strang and Jerome Buting , who were featured prominently in the documentary . “ If they did their job , I would n't be here . ”
Avery continues to maintain their innocence , and said they believe the truth will come out .
“ I know Kathleen will get down to the truth . I 'm not going to lose , ” they told In Touch .
Strang and Buting fascinated many viewers of “ Making a Murderer , ” which has spawned a slew of theories and counter-theories about whether Avery and their nephew , Brendan Dassey , truly killed Halbach or were framed by police . Prosecutors say the right men are in prison for the murder .
In 1996 , Columbia Journalism Review published an article called `` The Vincent Foster Factory , '' detailing the role played by Joseph Farah , then head of the Western Journalism Center , in promoting conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Clinton White House counsel Vince Foster . It states :
One of the Center 's major activities is trying to inject the dark view of Foster 's death into mainstream reporting and thinking . Last year , to this end , the Center bought full-page ads in several major newspapers , including The New York Times , to showcase Ruddy 's work and to offer for sale special Vince Foster reports , including a compilation of Ruddy 's stories , titled `` The Ruddy Investigation , '' for $ 12 , and a forty-minute `` riveting new video documentary '' titled `` Unanswered -- The Death of Vincent Foster , '' which Ruddy helped produce , and which goes for $ 35 .
Sound familiar ? That 's the same playbook -- promotion , conspiracies and selling trinkets to true believers -- Farah is running against Barack Obama on the birth certificate conspiracy .
As they did back then , Farah insisted their work is n't partisan . In 1996 , Farah claimed the WJC was merely `` a vigorous watchdog on government '' ; on July 29 , they asserted that `` this is not a left-right issue . This is not a conservative-liberal issue . This is not a Democrat-Republican issue . This is not an ideological issue . This is a matter of what 's true and what 's not . ''
Both claims are , in essence , false . As ConWebWatch detailed , Farah 's WJC was interested in being `` a vigorous watchdog on government '' only when Democrats were in charge ; the organization was dormant throughout the Bush presidency , and only recently sprung back to life under the leadership of right-wing political operative Floyd Brown just in time for a new Democratic administration . Brown , like Farah , is obsessed with the birth certificate issue .
The WJC 's disdain for holding Republicans accountable carried over to WND . As ConWebWatch noted , WND stayed away from the issue of Bush 's service in the National Guard in early 2004 when others were reporting on the issue and Bush 's reluctance to release relevant information ( though WND found time to smear Bush 's eventual 2004 opponent , John Kerry , by publishing false and discredited rumors of an affair ) . It arrived late to the game with a single article that was more interested in covering for Bush than acting like a watchdog on the issue .
WND was completely silent , however , on another recent birth certificate-related issue . Blogger Andrew Sullivan crusaded throughout the 2008 presidential campaign and beyond demanding that Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin release the birth certificate of infant Trig ; Palin has presented Trig as their son , but rumors swirled that Trig was actually the son of Palin 's teenage daughter , Bristol . WND devoted no articles to the Palin controversy , and Palin to this day has refused to release the birth certificate .
Yet , in an August 2 article , WND praised Sullivan for joining `` the rising chorus of voices across the political spectrum calling for Barack Obama to release their original , long-form birth certificate to put aside growing doubts about their eligibility for the presidency . '' WND made no mention of Sullivan 's longtime demand that Trig Palin 's birth certificate be released .
Farah 's pursuit of Foster and the Obama birth certificate share another trait -- a fondness for false claims . CJR reported in 1996 :
As 60 Minutes reports , Ruddy has acknowledged one serious error . In two chapters of `` The Ruddy Investigation , '' both copyrighted in 1994 , they question how the fatal gun could have been found in Foster 's right hand when Foster was left-handed . In fact , Foster was right-handed . Farah says , `` Ruddy and I have been at the forefront of the information trail to correct '' this error . But in early 1996 , the Center was continuing to sell `` The Ruddy Investigation '' with the error still standing .
Further , Ruddy 's book stemming from the WJC-linked Foster investigation was rejected even by conservatives like Ann Coulter , who wrote in their book `` Slander '' : `` Even if Christopher Ruddy 's The Strange Death of Vince Foster was considered a conservative hoax book , it was also conservatives who discredited it . ''
All of that , of course , was counter to the numerous investigations by people without an ideological ax to grind -- and , in independent counsel Kenneth Starr , someone who arguably did -- that all came to the same conclusion : Foster committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park .
As ConWebWatch has detailed , Farah and WND have reported numerous claims regarding the birth certificate that have been proven false , but WND has made no effort to correct the record . WND has also told numerous falsehoods about Obama in general .
Since the truth does not appear to matter to Farah , WND 's falsehood-strewn trail would seem to put the lie to their assertion that `` This is a matter of what 's true and what 's not . ''
Yet it 's also about something else Farah is loath to mention : It 's a matter of dollars and cents .
At the end of Farah 's July 29 column was this note : `` Want to turn up the pressure to learn the facts ? Get your signs and postcards asking for the president 's birth certificate documentation from the Birth Certificate Store ! ''
Indeed , WND has a cornucopia of items related to the issue . Among them :
In a rehash of the WJC 's purchase of full-page newspaper ads to reprint Ruddy 's dubious Foster reporting , WND is buying space on billboards across the country ( and asking readers to pitch in ) asking the question , `` Where 's the birth certificate ? '' The question , of course , can just as easily apply to Sarah Palin .
WND even sold readers a letter it would send to Obama in time for their birthday Aug. 4 for the low , low price of $ 6.95 . But even that letter contained a falsehood : It asserted that `` The problem with the short-form certification is that it could easily be obtained for a birth that took place out of the state or out of the country . All it would take is the word of one parent . ''
That claim has been debunked by none other than the Western Journalism Center -- the Farah-founded organization that attacked the Clinton administration over Foster .
WND later claimed that it sent out `` more than 1,200 personalized letters . '' At $ 6.95 a letter , that 's a gross of more than $ 8,340 . It most assuredly did not cost WND $ 8,340 to personalize those letters , print them out and FedEx them to the White House -- meaning that WND made a tidy profit on the venture .
CJR noted that `` About half of the $ 500,000 that came into the Center last year [ 1995 ] came from individuals who bought Foster merchandise . '' The same pattern appears to be recurring with WND 's birther pursuit . All those trinkets must keep the money rolling in . And unlike the nonprofit WJC ( Farah claimed not to take a WJC salary ) , WorldNetDaily is a for-profit venture , so Farah -- as WND 's majority owner -- is making coin in a way they reportedly did n't from the WJC .
Since WND is privately held , it does n't have to release financial records . That 's ironic given Farah 's demand for transparency from Obama . Indeed , WND has operated in a very opaque manner regarding its birth certificate coverage , almost as if it were hiding something .
Which would not be a surprise . After all , it was largely unknown at the time that the WJC was essentially a closed circle of promotion -- it accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from right-wing philanthropist Richard Mellon Scaife to finance and promote reporting by an employee of a Scaife-owned newspaper .
It 's also not a surprise that Farah would run the Foster playbook on Obama . To Farah , Foster and the birth certificate are indistinguishable , serving only as a tool , a means to the end of smearing a president with whom they disagree . Only this time , they profit directly from their activism . And if WND ever starts telling the truth and admits the birth certificate issue is bogus , a burgeoning source of revenue evaporates .
Simply put , it 's not in Farah 's financial interest to tell the truth about Obama 's birth certificate , and WND 's coverage has borne this out .
Ultimately , Joseph Farah 's record shows all too well what they really are .
They are not a journalist -- he 's a partisan political operative , just as they were before .
They are not looking to uphold the Constitution -- they want to destroy a duly elected president , just as they tried to do before .
They do not care about the truth -- just as they did before , they peddle lies .
Had I been offered a bet , I would have put money on May being the cruellest month for people who go on about statehood , currencies , the intricacies of EU membership , and all the endless rest of it .
I would have filled in the bookies ' slip confident that , by the spring of 2014 , the state of the nation could be defined in two words : `` bored witless '' .
I would have been wrong . As a tiny phenomenon , the personal part is neither novel nor interesting . It is slight testimony , nevertheless , to the fact that Scotland 's referendum has become a triumph without a vote being cast . People care , care deeply , and intend to show it with their ballot papers . For `` a nation of drunks '' , that 's not bad going .
As we reported yesterday , the people who study these things are as sure as they can be of a big turnout on September 18 . The ScotCen work on the latest Scottish Social Attitudes Survey suggests that somewhere between 70 % and 80 % of those resident in the country will deliver an opinion .
Standing now at 4.12 million , voter registration is higher than it has ever been . Defying the usual cliches , 80 % of 16 and 17-year-olds have already claimed their say . This , notoriously , is the age of apathy . This is an era in which we know , from hard experience , that voting changes nothing . In these times we understand too well that the convictions , passions and hopes of millions only ever result in more of the same .
Yet on September 18 we mean to vote to show that this time , if only once , voting matters . The vote will be a gesture of belief in the act of voting .
What makes the phenomenon fascinating is the fact that a majority still seem determined to vote No . There remains a passionate belief , it appears , in the hope that nothing will change . For a No voter , negative is somehow positive . ScotCen believes the Yes campaign has a 2 % edge - I 'd call that a conservative estimate - born of sheer commitment . The fact is an argument in itself . But the overarching truth is that a nation is in the throes , one way or another , of self-determination .
Unionists do n't care for that language , predictably enough . Theirs is an effort that depends on the proscription of words - nation , self-determination , progress - that fail to sit well within the familiar ceremonial strait jackets .
The irony is that they leave themselves with precious little to say about the Britain they mean to defend . They want the words - country , pride , bonds - that they deem insufferable in others .
The very fact of fighting a referendum for the sake of No is a recognition of reality . Had Scotland been assimilated properly over these last three and a bit century we would not be having this argument . The crude paranoid insults - `` ethnic separatism '' and the rest - fail to describe a country in a furious debate with itself . This ca n't be a bad thing . Scotland will have its debate and its vote . The plebiscite itself settles the biggest question . Do we still exist ? Yes , we do . Truly .
Since I 'll be voting Yes , I view the game from one end of the park . That is n't necessarily the best or only view . Still , from my perspective the energy , belief and inventiveness of those I these days call young is another answer to another question . I am optimistic , for a change , about a country capable of this much fun , games and hard work . Scotland has a generation on its hands that has no recent precedent . Mercifully , they do n't know much about what their country went through in the 1970s and 1980s .
They have probably found out , being attentive , about what became of the oil money , and how we got Trident , and why we were libelled as scroungers , and how we sent people like them to die in criminal wars .
But they were n't there , I 'm glad to say , and they think more often of the future than the past .
I am glad to have witnessed the rising generation that has made the Yes campaign the most important thing to happen in European politics in 20 years . If the referendum delivers nothing else , it will guarantee an optimism of spirit for the future of the country . A new generation is alive , alert , creative and busy . It actually believes that voting can change things : there 's a turn-up for the books . `` Heave awa ' , lads , '' as a local comic once observed from the debris at the foot of a Leith tenement , `` We 're no deid yet . ''
We are , though , that `` nation of drunks '' , and several other things besides . Recently , I disconcerted a few people by saying that I was n't queuing up for my `` Scottish and Proud Of It '' badge . Aside from taking issue with the ornate allegiances of pick and mix Unionists , I was trying to say something simple . I am not yet ready to take pride in a country that is too often parochial , narrow-minded , bigoted , troubled , and - as the latest First Minister `` controversy '' reminded us - drunk .
`` The point , '' as some old beardy once said in some theses , `` is to change it . '' In this referendum the old , familiar pessimism over Scotland runs headlong into the new optimism . Perhaps another generation will be disillusioned . That would be traditional . Perhaps , too , people will go to the polling stations less outraged by Alex Salmond 's scandalous remarks than intrigued , ready to ask questions about their national community , and about themselves .
Why are we so drunk , so often , even as we perform a textbook demonstration of how a democracy should function while it contemplates the future for old , young and unborn ?
The literary and cultural critics have plenty of cliches to hand where the Scots , pessimism and optimism are concerned . Supposedly , the contradictory trait is in with the bricks and the bones . It is , apparently , the way we 've always been : if in doubt , self-destruct .
A Yes vote will not transform your life . You might want to leave things for a decade or so , in fact , before counting the gains . But in a contest between dependent drunks and a community that thinks and believes things can surely be better , where would the smart betting money go ?
I 'm Scottish and would like to be proud of it . One of those assigned traits says I 'm just the type to go for it , then , hell for leather .
Nations should not be discussed in these terms , of course . Discuss national character and heckling ensues . But it is still allowed , just about , to talk about groups of people in terms of the choices available to them .
This nation of drunks ( and worse ) could perhaps think better of itself this September by the simple act of casting a ballot . A No vote is intellectual pessimism of the absolute sort .
Just to allow Unionists a free go , I 'll invoke Nietzsche . They once described a nation as an entity that `` understands itself '' . I 'd prefer to call it a community that tries unendingly to understand itself .
Whatever else happens in Scotland on September 18 , no one will be able to say that we have n't tried . No one will be able to say we got bored , either .
Does The Strengthening Economy Still Need Congress ?
Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP Mark Lennihan/AP
Congress on Friday approved legislation to continue a payroll tax holiday and extend benefits for the long-term unemployed .
The goal is to make sure Americans have enough spending money to keep the recovery from faltering . President Obama is expected to sign the legislation .
And most economists are applauding , saying Congress should pass the measure to stimulate growth , even though many indicators already are pointing up . Recent data show job creation is accelerating , retail sales are improving and even housing is perking up a bit . The stock market has been advancing sharply .
But all of it is fragile .
`` If you withdrew the stimulus , consumer spending would be less , '' said Ann Owen , a professor at Hamilton College and a former economist at the Federal Reserve .
And this economy needs every possible penny of consumer spending because it remains so far from healthy , they said . `` Consumer confidence is growing , but we 're not there yet , '' they said . `` There would be a real risk if you withdrew this stimulus . ''
Last year , Congress agreed to cut the payroll tax , which funds Social Security . The tax holiday expired with 2011 , but was revived for the first two months of this year . The new legislation would extend the tax holiday through the end of the year .
That extension means a savings of about $ 20 a week to a worker earning $ 50,000 a year . That extra cash can help people keep up with the price of gasoline and groceries .
The legislation also will provide unemployed workers , who typically get about 26 weeks of jobless benefits , with up to 99 weeks of payments . Later this year , the cap would gradually decline to 73 weeks . The unemployment rate has dropped in recent months , but remains very high at 8.3 percent . More than 12 million people are still looking for work .
Robert Shapiro , an economist who served as the undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs during the Clinton administration , said that despite recent upticks in hiring , `` employment continues to be significantly lower than it should be . ''
If the recovery were truly in gear , then both interest rates and inflation would be rising , said Shapiro , who now heads Sonecon LLC , an economic advisory firm .
`` We will know through other signs when the economy is really building momentum , '' they said . `` People will start to say : 'Hey , we can raise our prices . ' But those signs are n't there yet . ''
If anything , Congress should be doing more to stimulate a level of growth that could fend off shocks , they said . `` There are real and serious threats to the economy . We could have a spike in energy prices , which could get much worse in the event of a crisis around Iran . And there 's the threat of a European meltdown , '' they said . `` It would be very dangerous to leave the economy without help now . ''
But Kevin Hassett , an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute , a research group , said that if they were a lawmaker voting today , `` I would not do this . ''
Hassett said temporary tax holidays and unemployment extensions just make people more dependent on Congress ' whims and ultimately put the economy on less firm footing . Instead of tossing out short-term stimulus measures , `` I would do a big fiscal reform , '' they said .
That would provide businesses , investors and workers with confidence about the future of taxes and deficits , they said . When Congress shifts its focus from long-term growth to annual fixes , `` you can get into a cycle of dependency , '' they said .
Here are two things that are true about the economy today .
( 1 ) The Dow Jones industrial average is poised to set a new record as corporate profits stretch to all-time highs .
( 2 ) There are still fewer working Americans today than there were before the start of the Great Recession .
The fact that these two things can be true at the same time might outrage you . But it should n't surprise you . In the last 30 years , there has been a great divergence between growth and workers ' incomes , as the New York Times reminds us today . Corporate profits have soared , in the last decade especially , particularly because of three things : Globalization has pushed down the cost of labor available to multinational corporations ; technology has allowed companies to make more with fewer workers , in general ; and Big Finance has gobbled up the economy , as the banks ' share of total corporate profits has tripled to about one-third since the middle of the last century , according to Evan Soltas .
Here 's the short story of corporate profits , GDP , and workers ' income since the Great Recession . As you can see , corporations rode a wild roller coaster , but they quickly found their way back on top . GDP has been sluggish and overall labor income has struggled to keep up with even that sluggish pace .

PARÍS.–The U.S. blockade of Cuba was denounced as a violation of international law and the principal obstacle to the island 's development , according to participants in a colloquium on current affairs in Cuba , held in the French capital .
Héctor Igarza , Cuban ambassador in Paris , commented that despite the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba , the United States government continues to enforce the economic , commercial and financial blockade and , increasingly , its extra-territorial reach .
They recalled that since 2009 , fines for a total of 14 billion dollar have been levied on international banks and companies , for doing business with Cuba , in a clear violation of international law .
Stéphane Witkowsky , president of the Advanced Research Institute 's Council of Strategic Orientation on Latin America , likewise noted that , given its history of more than 50 years , the U.S. blockade is the most longstanding aggression of this kind , reiterating that Washington has sanctioned several French banks despite the fact that financial transactions with Cuba are conducted in strict accordance with international law .
French intellectual Salim Lamrani , organizer of the event held in the city 's Casa de América Latina , emphasized that the political battle must continue , urging international condemnation of the blockade which constitutes the principle obstacle to Cuba 's development . ( PL )
WASHINGTON—U.S . Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused themselves Thursday from federal investigations related to the 2016 election campaign , including a probe of interactions between the Russian government and associates of U.S. President Donald Trump . Sessions ' decision came the afternoon after the Washington Post revealed they had misled the Senate when they said under oath that they “ did not have any communications with the Russians ” during the campaign . In fact , they had at least two meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions says they will recuse themselves from a federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 White House election .
Sessions insisted at a Thursday news conference that their answer had been “ honest. ” But they conceded under questioning that they should have disclosed they had met “ one Russian official a couple of times. ” Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump The uproar surrounding Sessions , who was a prominent Trump campaign adviser , is only the latest development in a sprawling Russia controversy that has alternated between a simmer and a blaze throughout Trump 's entire six-week-old presidency . Sessions is at least the second top Trump appointee to become engulfed by criticism over their inaccurate claims related to contact with Kislyak .

The other one , former national security adviser Michael Flynn , resigned in February . Sessions brushed aside top Democrats ' Thursday calls for their own resignation , and Trump said they thought Sessions had “ probably ” been truthful in their testimony . Sessions said they were recusing themselves only because they had been involved in Trump 's campaign , implying their January remarks were not a factor . Regardless , the revelation that they deceived Congress adds more fuel to unproven suspicions that Trump is attempting to conceal something about their relationship with Russia and President Vladimir Putin . And the withdrawal of the nation 's top law enforcement official from a major investigation deepens the appearance of disarray from an administration that was briefly buoyed by Trump 's well-received speech to Congress on Tuesday .

Attorney General Jeff on Thursday announced their recusal from overseeing an investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government . ( DOUG MILLS / New York Times )

Why is Sessions controversy a big deal ? The attorney general is the country 's chief legal official , and they may have lied to Congress under oath . Before the recusal , the conversations with Kislyak put them in an apparent conflict of interest : the director of the FBI reports to him . And whether it was a lie , an evasion or an unintentional memory lapse , their decision not to tell Congress they had spoken to the ambassador added concerns that something improper transpired . What are the key questions about Trump and Russia ? Did Trump have anything to do with , or know about , Russia 's alleged intervention in the election to help him ? Did Trump direct their associates to communicate with Russian officials during the campaign , or know those communications were happening ? What exactly did Trump associates say to Russian officials ? Does Russia have any information that could blackmail or otherwise weaken Trump ? So who is investigating what ? Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies are conducting a joint probe into the alleged Russian interference in the election , which they believe involved the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairperson . One of the things they are studying , according to the New York Times , is communication between Trump associates and the Russian government .
U.S. President Donald Trump says they have `` total '' confidence in Attorney General Jeff Sessions , as calls mount for Sessions to resign or recuse themselves over their contact with a Russian envoy during last year 's presidential campaign .
The Senate and House intelligence committees are conducting their own separate probes into the alleged Russian meddling . Some Democrats have advocated an investigation by an independent commission . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Thursday for a special prosecutor from outside the Department of Justice . Is there proof that Trump did anything wrong ? None that we know of . So why is there so much talk about all this ? There is no public smoking gun . There is , however , a collection of facts that has prompted suspicion among Democrats and others . Trump has effusively praised and aggressively defended Putin . Their campaign team , largely hands-off when it came to the Republican policy platform , intervened to soften the platform 's support of Ukraine . During the campaign , Trump publicly urged Russian hackers to obtain Clinton 's emails . After U.S. intelligence and independent experts later concluded that Russia had indeed hacked the Democrats , Trump dismissed and disparaged them .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions agreed Thursday to recuse themselves from an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election , saying they believes 'the proper decision has been reached . '
Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak , told Vice-President Mike Pence they had not done so , then resigned after the Washington Post revealed the truth . Trump 's former campaign manager , Paul Manafort , has long-standing ties to Russia , and they resigned from the campaign after allegations that they had received millions in cash from Ukraine 's former pro-Russia president . Was it wrong for Sessions to meet the Russian ambassador ? Not necessarily . They were a U.S. senator , and they met many ambassadors . But the context raises questions about what went on . One of the meetings was held in September 2016 , the month before U.S. intelligence officially accused Russia of doing the hacking . While Sessions said the meeting was not about the campaign , all 25 other members of the Armed Services Committee told the Post they did not meet with Kislyak in 2016 . On Thursday , Sessions said Ukraine “ somehow ” came up in the conversation ; they did not elaborate .

Swiss police have seized several looted items from a duty-free warehouse in Geneva , some of which came from the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra , Geneva state prosecutors announced on Friday , Switzerland 's Neue Zurcher Zeitung reported .
A total of nine culturally and historically important artifacts were seized , and they should be returned to their place of origin , Swiss authorities said . In the meantime , they will be exhibited in the local museum for art and history .
The operation recovered several looted artifacts from the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra , a UNESCO world heritage site which was overrun by the Daesh terror group in 2015 and liberated by Syrian government forces in March this year .

The city of Palmyra dates back 4,000 years , and most of its ruins date back to the Roman era . After they overran the city the Daesh terror group destroyed many ancient monuments , including the Baal Shamin temple and triumphal arch .
According to the group 's fundamentalist Islamic doctrine , grave markers and statues are symbols of pagan idol-worshipping , and ought to be destroyed .

SAGINAW — From the start , Tom Kaatz played a role in the Old Saginaw City Lawn Chair Film Festival , but he 's taking the lead these days .
And that , with the help of a committee passionate about keeping the summer series rolling , means people can head again for North Hamilton and Ames on July 10 to catch John Vasquez and the Bearinger Boys warming the crowd for the Coen brothers ' `` True Grit . ''
`` I 'm eager to see that one , and I 'm really anxious about 'Heartbreaker , ' a foreign film that got a lot of attention , '' Kaatz said .
Preview • What : Old Saginaw City Lawn Chair Film Festival • When : 8 p.m. Sunday , July 10-Aug. 14 • Where : North Hamilton and Ames , Saginaw • Cost : Free • Info : lawnchairfilmfestival.org
The film festival folks are collaborating with the Old Town Motorfest on July 17 , carrying the car-gate theme through `` Grease '' and the early rock 'n ' roll sounds of the Bull 's Eye Band .
`` Another idea we had tossed around for a long time was moving to another site for one night , to give another organization the exposure , '' Kaatz said . And this year , `` Happy Feet , '' the animated family film about dancing penguins , will be shown at the Children 's Zoo at Celebration Square , with Log Jam opening the show .
`` I just got off the phone with Nancy Parker and she 's thrilled to have 1,500 to 2,000 people stop by . We 're going to shoot a promo video for it , interviewing the penguins at the zoo . And who knows ? Next year , we might go the Montague Inn or the Japanese Tea House or the Andersen Enrichment Center . ''
Also returning this year is Argontos , the popular ensemble that will open July 31 for the John Waters classic , `` Hairspray . ''
Arlene Maul and their husband , the late Bob Maul , were the first to come up with the idea of beaming movies on the side of the historic building at North Hamilton and Ames , and in 2003 , it was a reality .
And it has continued every year , despite wind storms that shredded the screen in 2007 , increases in the various fees and , last year , disturbances among people in the area . Maul stepped aside this year , and handed the reins to Kaatz and their committee , who made security a top priority .
`` We met with the police at the beginning , and through many meetings and conversations came up with a plan that would make people feel safe not only when they 're on the site but walking back to their cars after the show , '' Kaatz said .
The biggest difference folks will notice this year , they said , is that the film festival site is totally enclosed with a specified entrance . Citing curfew laws , the festival board will require those 16 or younger to come with a parent or guardian .
The new guidelines also limit people coming into the grounds once the movie started and the coming and going throughout the feature .
`` Reserve police officers will be inside the fence , and we 'll have on-duty officers around the perimeters , handing the peripheral crowd , '' Katz added .
Community groups also are interested in policing the grounds , they said , so that Saginaw can again enjoy a free evening of community fun .
`` We got a late start this season but we were able to tie up a lot of loose ends and build a solid infrastructure for future series , '' Kaatz said . `` We 've made a lot of good contacts and came up with some new sponsors .
`` With the resources in place , we can ensure its longevity . ''
Here are the new rules :
* Bring a chair , blanket or something comfortable to sit on while enjoying the movie .
* In compliance with the City of Saginaw Police Department 's curfew law , a parent or guardian must accompany anyone 16 or younger .
* There is no admittance to the Film Festival site 15 minutes after the start of the film , and those 20 and younger can not return to the Film Festival site 15 minutes after the film starts .
* In respect of others watching the movie , do n't talk on the cell phone . If you need to use the phone , excuse yourself and talk in an area where others wo n't be disturbed .
* No alcohol is allowed in the Film Festival site for any reason .
* No pets are allowed inside the Film Festival site .
* Skateboards and bicycles can not be used inside the Film Festival site .
Anyone disturbing or causing a disruption during the movie will be escorted out of the Film Festival site and will not be allowed to return .

NBC 's Pete Williams reports on the 7-2 decision that knocked down Arizona 's requirement for would-be voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship .
The Supreme Court on Monday struck down an Arizona law that requires people to submit proof of citizenship when they register to vote .
The vote was 7-2 . Justice Antonin Scalia , writing for the majority , said that a 1993 federal law known as the Motor Voter Act takes precedence over the Arizona law because of its requirement that states “ accept and use ” the federal voter registration form .
Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , two members of the court 's conservative wing , dissented .
Only a handful of states has similar laws , which the states say are meant to reduce voter fraud . Civil rights groups said the Arizona law was an effort to discourage voting by legal immigrants , and they worried that more states would have followed if the Supreme Court had upheld it .
Groups opposed to the Arizona law said that the court had blocked an attempt at voter suppression .
“ Today 's decision sends a strong message that states can not block their citizens from registering to vote by superimposing burdensome paperwork requirements on top of federal law , ” said Nina Perales , vice president of litigation for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund .
Citizenship is a requirement to vote in any federal election , and the federal registration form requires people to state , under penalty of perjury , that they are American citizens . States can use their own forms , but they must be equivalent to the federal form .
The Arizona law , known as Proposition 200 and adopted by Arizona voters in 2004 , went further than the federal form by requiring applicants to provide proof of citizenship . Arizona has used the law to reject 30,000 voter applications , according to the Brennan Center for Justice .
Challengers to the law argued that it put an extra burden on naturalized citizens . Using a naturalization document as proof would require an applicant to register in person , as opposed to through the mail , because federal law prohibits copying the document .
A federal appeals court said that Arizona had gone too far and essentially rejected the federal form . Arizona said it was not a rejection of the federal form any more than asking for ID at an airport is a rejection of a plane ticket .
The Supreme Court ruling pointed out that Arizona still has an option : It can ask the federal government to include state-specific instructions on the federal form , and go to court if the government says no .
Three other states — Alabama , Georgia and Kansas — have laws almost identical to Arizona 's and joined it in urging the court to uphold the additional requirement for proof of citizenship .
At an oral argument in March , Thomas Horne , a lawyer for Arizona , told the justices that the state was within its rights to ask for additional information beyond the simple federal form .
“ It 's extremely inadequate , ” Horne said . “ It 's essentially an honor system . It does not do the job . ”
“ Well , ” answered Justice Sonia Sotomayor , “ that 's what the federal system decided was enough . ”
The court 's conservatives had appeared sympathetic to the Arizona side . Scalia said during the argument that federal law clearly empowers the states to take additional action to assess a potential voter 's eligibility .
“ Under oath is not proof at all , ” they said . “ It 's just a statement . ”
Patricia Millett , a lawyer for groups opposed to the law , countered : “ Statements under oath in a criminal case are proof beyond a reasonable doubt ” in criminal cases that result in execution .
“ It 's a very serious oath , ” they said .
Arizona is known for its tough stance on immigration . Last year , the Supreme Court struck down some key provisions of a state law meant to crack down on illegal immigration .
But it let stand the most controversial part — a requirement that police making traffic stops check the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally .

CLOSE In this episode of `` Preachin ' Pistons '' podcast , Vince Ellis talks with Pistons director of international scouting J.R. Holden about why fans should n't fear foreign draft prospects , and what has changed since 2003 , when Pistons drafted Darko Milicic .
Texas forward Jarrett Allen ( 31 ) . ( Photo : Sue Ogrocki , Associated Press )
Jarrett Allen is scheduled to be the next big-name frontcourt prospect to visit the Detroit Pistons .
The Texas center , projected to go in the first round of the NBA draft later this month , will work out for the Pistons on Thursday , according to Tandem Sports & Entertainment , the agency that represents Allen .
Allen will join UCLA 's Ike Anigbogu , Duke 's Harry Giles , Kentucky 's Bam Adebayo and North Carolina 's Tony Bradley as frontcourt products who have worked out for the Pistons , who hold the 12th overall pick on June 22 .
Creighton center Justin Patton is also scheduled to work out with the Pistons , but it 's not clear when that will occur .
Allen , 19 , left Texas after one season . Their 12 double-doubles were the most by a first-year student in the country .
Allen is raw , but their length is an attraction with draft combine measurements of a 7-5 wingspan to go along with a 9-2 standing reach . It more than makes up for their 6-10 height , which could be considered undersized for a center . But it 's hardly a concern in the modern game with the advent of small-ball .
Add quick feet and quick leaping ability , and you have a prospect made for development .

In their Mail on Sunday article today ( keep scrolling ) David Rose reveals that the BBC - at least in Scotland - has a new policy of protecting climatologists from challenge on air .
A BBC executive in charge of editorial standards has ordered programme editors not to broadcast debates between climate scientists and global warming sceptics . Alasdair MacLeod claimed that such discussions amount to ‘ false balance ' and breach an undertaking to the Corporation 's watchdog , the BBC Trust . Mr MacLeod , head of editorial standards and compliance for BBC Scotland , sent an email on February 27 to 18 senior producers and editors , which has been obtained by The Mail on Sunday . It reads : ‘ When covering climate change stories , we should not run debates / discussions directly between scientists and sceptics .
If dissenters from the climate consensus are not to be allowed to put their case directly , there is presumably little point in having those arguments put by BBC interviewers . So from now on the pronouncements of climatologists will be treated as holy writ and the most alarmist scientists can be allowed to scaremonger without fear of contradiction . The consensus over the existence of the greenhouse effect is used as a pretence that all aspects of the climatology are beyond debate .
Coming so soon after the brouhaha over the Lawson/Hoskins discussion on the Today programme , it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the BBC are dancing to the tune of the environmental movement . The effects of the 28gate seminar seem to live on .
The end of the licence fee can not come soon enough .
Teen Wolf 's Tyler Posey Apologizes for Fake Coming Out
Tyler Posey recently shared a video on Snapchat that some believed to be a coming out . In the video , they approach Gay Street in New York 's West Village , recording a shot of the street sign .
“ This is me , ” they say in the video . “ I am this and this is me . I 've never felt more alive . I 'm gay ! ”
Although the thought of the Teen Wolf star coming out would have been exciting news for young gay fans around the world , it 's hard to take the video seriously considering their reputation for goofing around on social media . But given their reputation for being an ally to the LGBT community , we would have hoped he 'd be smart enough not to make such a joke .
Sure enough , Posey took to Twitter to explain the apparent misunderstanding :
I am a big proponent of love over hate , and standing together during divisive times . — tyler posey ( @ tylergposey ) July 30 , 2016
[ Part 2 ] : Although I 'm not gay , I fully support the LGBTQ community . This was a moment intended to reflect that . — tyler posey ( @ tylergposey ) July 30 , 2016
In a world first , bioengineers have used human cells to create the common drug heparin , a lifesaving blood-thinner .
This is a big deal , because right now , heparin is created using animal tissue , which can be contaminated and can cause severe adverse reactions . The possibility of using human cells instead – from a genetically engineered human cell line – will make the drug safer , more effective , and keep animals out of the process .
`` Heparin is used worldwide . It 's currently an [ US ] $ 8 billion market and its use is only increasing , '' says Megan Lord , one of the researchers from the University of New South Wales Faculty of Engineering ( UNSW Engineering ) , in Australia .
Heparin is commonly used to prevent blood clots when a patient is undergoing surgery or dialysis .
It 's estimated that 12 million patients every year in the US receive heparin , and that demand is only going up – the industry is set to double in the next 10 years .
It 's also on the World Health Organisation 's list of essential medicines , so finding a way to produce it more safely is a big deal ..
`` It was actually a serendipitous finding , '' Lord said . `` We did n't set out to make heparin in the laboratory . The discovery was through a fundamental project focused on understanding how inflammatory cells are involved in wound healing . ''
But once they had the basics , the team was able to bioengineer heparin ( a carbohydrate ) by using human cells as a ‘ bioreactor ' – or tiny biological factory for the drug .
The human cells , called HMC-1 , are a type of lab-cultured immune cell , and were genetically edited to produce excess amounts of heparin , which the researchers could then extract .
This means the source of heparin going forward could be based entirely on human cells grown from scratch in the lab , rather than from cell samples taken from animal subjects .
`` With our method , we 've shown , for the first time , an alternative and much safer method to producing heparin by using bioreactors to culture cells to produce the carbohydrate drug , '' explains Lord .
`` Now we 've demonstrated producing heparin in lab scale production , the next stage is to refine the bioreactor conditions to increase the amount and potency of the heparin we produce . ''
But , as with most biological discoveries , we wo n't be seeing this new improved version on the shelf in the near future .
`` We hope to have a product on the market within 10 to 15 years , '' Lord added .
The research has been published in Metabolic Engineering .

Marvel 's The Avengers 2 is due to begin shoot at Pinewood-Shepperton in early 2014 , with production due to get underway later this year .
Slated for a spring 2015 release through Disney , Screen understands that the film is scheduled to shoot at Shepperton Studios , marking the latest collaboration between Marvel and the Buckinghamshire hub , with the US juggernaut recently wrapping shoot at the studios on Thor : The Dark World and gearing up for shoot on Guardians of the Galaxy this summer .
While plot and cast details have been kept under wraps , Joss Whedon is returning to write and direct the sequel , whose original cast included Chris Hemsworth as Thor , Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man , Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow , Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Chris Evans as Captain America .
Marvel 's decision to continue its collaboration with Pinewood-Shepperton will be music to the ears of local crew , VFX houses , the BFI and the UK government in particular , which are all keen to see levels of inward investment restored to their 2011 high of more than $ 1.5bn .
Recent major productions to shoot at the studios include Maleficent , Jack Ryan and The Muppets sequel while Disney 's live-action version of Cinderella is also due to get underway soon .
The Avengers ( aka Marvel 's Avengers Assemble in the UK ) , which shot entirely in the US , grossed more than $ 1.5bn worldwide , making it the biggest film of 2012 and the third biggest film to date ( based on unadjusted grosses ) behind Avatar and Titanic .
The plot saw Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D . bring together a team of superheroes to form the Avengers and help save the Earth from Loki and their army .
Whedon recently wrapped TV pilot S.H.I.E.L.D. , also set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe .
Story highlights The penalty is the latest salvo in long-running dispute between Globovision and the government
The broadcaster is fined 7.5 % of its gross income for violating the law
The government accuses the network of inciting anxiety in the public
The $ 2.2 million fine could mean the end of Globovision
Venezuela 's telecommunications regulator , Conatel , fined private television broadcaster Globovision Tuesday 7.5 % of its gross income for alleged violations of the country 's media responsibility laws , marking the latest salvo in the long-running feud between the broadcaster and the government .
Globovision said it would appeal the fine of 9,300,000 bolivares fuertes ( $ 2.2 million ) , which the station said risked bankrupting it . Conatel 's director , Pedro Maldonado , however , said during a news conference that the fine could not be appealed .
Globovision is Venezuela 's last remaining television broadcaster that is openly critical of President Hugo Chavez .
The fine stems from Globovision 's coverage of a standoff at the Rodeo II prison in June and July .
The station violated a law that prohibits stirring anxiety in the public and instigating intolerance for political reasons , Maldonado said . These are violations under a media responsibility law passed in December .
The goal of the law is to establish `` social responsibility '' in those who provide television , radio and Internet service . The law affects all text , images , sound or context sent or received in Venezuela .
Maldonado said the sanction does not seek to suspend the transmission of Globovision , a 24-hour news station .
But Maria Fernanda Flores , a vice president of the network , said paying that sum could spell the end of its broadcast .
`` This fine represents the bankruptcy of Globovision , '' they said .
The government official said Globovision had `` a couple of days '' to pay the fine .
Globovision defended its coverage of the prison standoff , which started with a riot that killed at least 22 people and turned into a nearly monthlong standoff between prisoners and national guard troops .
The broadcaster said it was denied access at the scene and completed its reporting fairly and in a balanced way given its limitations .
Claudio Paolillo , a member of the freedom of expression committee of the Inter-American Press Association , likened Chavez to a dictator in an interview with Globovision and said the fine was a roundabout way to shutter the station .
`` The political objective is to shut down all the voices who are critical or independent , '' they said .
Chavez and their top leadership did not immediately comment on the move .
The broadcaster is the last remaining TV network that carries an anti-Chavez line , since the president refused to renew the license of another opposition station , RCTV , allegedly over telecommunication regulation violations . The station had to go off public airwaves and transmit solely on cable .
Over the years , the government has launched various investigations into Globovision -- for everything from reporting about an earthquake before an official report had been issued , to failing to pay about $ 2.3 million in taxes . Station officials have said the charges are politically motivated .
Last year , the government secured a 25.8 % interest in the broadcaster when it took over two companies , which owned a 20 % and 5.8 % stake in Globovision , respectively .
The government 's interest was sufficient to name a representative to the broadcaster 's board , Chavez said then .
Their government has also gone after the owner of Globovision , Guillermo Zuloaga , who is wanted in Venezuela for allegedly illegally storing vehicles at their Caracas home with the intent to sell them for a profit .
The TV magnate , who is living in exile , has said they are being persecuted for political purposes and that the charges are trumped up . Their son is also wanted .
International groups accuse Chavez of using a friendly judiciary to silence critics and the press . The president , however , maintains there is robust freedom of the press in Venezuela .
The country 's constitution protects freedom of expression , but those who exercise it will be responsible for that content , the government has argued .
When I set out to create Remodel Fitness , I filled notebooks full of ideas for branding , purpose , mission statements , and content . I knew I wanted to help women feel more comfortable and empowered in their bodies , and I knew that fitness was my vehicle to help accomplish that . Fitness is not the only way to feel empowered , however , and today I want to talk about the deeply empowering quality of… nakedness .
I grew up believing in the sanctity of biology . To me it seemed that some stuff was more “ natural , ” and therefore good , and deserved to be honored . Real food instead of processed food , for example . Spending time in nature . Not using tons of products , or owning tons of stuff . Being barefoot ; being naked .
It always just felt right to me to be naked . As a kid I wanted to be naked all the time , and my superstar mom believed in honoring my autonomy . This led to countless times in which I succeeded at being naked when it was objectively NOT appropriate . What felt so good to me about being naked was , for lack of a better phrase , metaphysical rightness . It felt natural , like I was honoring my deepest and most primitive belonging to the earth . Long before my vocabulary adopted “ spiritual ” words , being naked to felt like being Home .
I 've gotten away from a lot of my guiding faith in “ naturalness ” as I 've gotten older , mostly out of convenience and from living in NYC . Wearing shoes feels normal now , I prefer to be clean , and I certainly use many not-so-natural products . But I 'm happiest when I honor and chase that feeling of metaphysical rightness , I 've decided to finally address the naked elephant in the room .
It 's not an easy task to feel Right in a world that body-shames and slut-shames and shame-shame-shames everyone into feeling deeply , inherently wrong . But I 've always had very strong feelings about natural , real-life nakedness . I think it 's an epic travesty that our culture does n't support it . There 's something inherently wrong to me about clothes being the default . I like clothes , do n't get me wrong . I like style , and I like being warm , and there 's no effing way I would ever sit my bare naked ass on , say , a NYC subway seat . But I also think that a huge amount of our cultural issues with body-shaming and distorted body image can be traced back to how uncomfortable we are with real , natural nakedness .
In many other cultures , you grow up seeing naked bodies around you . As a girl growing up in Europe or Latin America , you would frequently see all the women in your family naked , and in places like bathhouses and gyms , single-sex nudity is the norm . But not for us . Instead of seeing the real , child-bearing and life-enjoying bodies of our aunts and moms and sisters and friends , we grow up seeing only the tall , taught , tan , and totally photoshopped bodies of Victoria 's Secret models . Instead of seeing that breasts and bellies and thighs come in all sorts of wonderful shapes and sizes , we see only bodies that have been surgically and digitally altered to all look more or less the same . Perky , symmetrical , full breasts , gently toned flat stomachs , long lean legs .
It has been shown that even brief exposure to one kind of body type or size makes the viewer immediately prefer that kind of body type . Meaning : we prefer the kind of bodies we see the most often , and in our culture we are constantly inundated with one certain kind of female body . Most women who do n't have that size and shape of body feel so undeserving of showing their bodies in public that they cover up as much as possible , further decreasing our exposure to body diversity . Our culture 's lack of body diversity is really , really damaging to our psyches .
In high school , despite the fact that I grew up in a body-positive and sex-positive household , I was so flooded with anxiety about how “ wrong ” my natural body was , that I was completely unable to relax . There were so much about myself I needed to hide , and to distract from . It was a full time job ; I had to sit and stand in such a way that my limbs did n't soften and look fat , I had to suck my belly in hard , and I had to keep my chin forward so I did n't look like I had a double chin . At home alone I tweezed , shaved , did crunches , applied spray tans , and learned how to apply makeup to distract from all my flaws . I learned that there was only one acceptable way for a woman to look , and in many ways ( despite my endless crusade to love yourself ) , I 'm still unlearning it .
On top of being non-diverse and unrealistic/fake , the images of women 's bodies that we 're exposed to are also always sexualized in nature . We see hot A-list celebs getting naked in sex scenes , dancers twerking in rap videos , advertisements that take the phrase “ sex sells ” increasingly literally , and women in porn . We almost always see women 's bodies posed and performing for the male gaze ; if you pay attention to mainsteam media , if it becomes clear that women 's bodies are sexual objects for public consumption . If a woman does n't stack up to our standards of sexiness ( ie some fully-clothed politicians I can think of ) , people feel so cheated in their collective right to be titillated , that the woman gets slammed with judgement , shame , speculation over their frigidity , and observations about their weight .
Very rarely do you see a naked woman who is not posing or being objectified and sexualized in some way . When 's the last time you saw a naked woman just chillin ' , and like… vaccuuming , or gardening ; not being a sexual object in any way ? A woman being naked just for herself , instead of putting on a performance of sexuality , is hard to find . I 'd say Lena Dunham is the closest we 've got , and my goodness do they make people uncomfortable with their unapologetic , non-sexual nakedness .
Our lack of real-life , non-sexual nakedness makes us all feel Less Than . Women have become obsessed with “ fixing ” the endless ways in which their bare faces and bodies are wrong , and we are constantly aware of the sexual performance that is expected of us . When we fail at any of the above ( and we constantly feel like we are failing ) , there is shame .
Have you ever seen a toddler look ashamed of their body ? No , it 's impossible . She 's all like LOOK AT MY BELLY HAHHAHAHAHA ! People smother their little body in love , and they know in their little heart of hearts that there is absolutely nothing wrong with them The feeling of wrongness does n't come until later , when their psyche forms enough to realize that there are in fact hundreds , if not thousands , of things wrong with her , including the fact that they owe it to people to be sexy . Each of us is born with an inherent sense of belonging and rightness in our physical form ; it 's our birthright . That sense gets snatched away however , and can disappear for years , or decades , or even your whole life , if you let it .
So to this end , I am reclaiming my own sense of rightness , and getting naked . In high school I used to say if I ever got married I was going to have a nudist wedding . I 've always wanted to join a nudist colony , because I think the freedom experienced there would be spectacular . But now I think maybe my obsession with nakedness will serve another purpose : to bring more awareness to body love and acceptance into the world .
My inherent desire to be naked and free in public may have been burning for a long time , but it 's still terrifying . I know some people wo n't understand , and wo n't approve . I know I 'll probably lose followers for this . After all , the only people who get naked willingly in a public fashion are either “ asking for it , ” or making a statement . I suppose I fall in the second camp , but I wish it did n't have to be such a statement . I wish me getting naked on the internet did n't warrant a whole explanation and discussion , but this is where we are right now . I 'm simply saying : there 's nothing to hide here . Our naked bodies should n't freak people out .
As a quick aside , I am staying within the legality and social media rules of covering my actual private parts ; as much as I want to # freethenipple , I 'm not willing to risk losing any of my accounts . I 'm using filters on the photos , because it makes them seem more “ artistic ” and less “ soft-core porn. ” And I 'm doing yoga poses because I think that best demonstrates the rightness of my body as a life-force . There will undoubtedly be more where this came from , as time goes on .
Also , I 'm aware that many people will look at these photos and say I have beauty-privilege : that because my body fits society 's standards of fit or beautiful , that I am “ allowed ” to get naked . But please know , it 's not about that . I 'm still afraid , even as I 'm about to press “ publish ” that you wo n't understand , and that you 'll judge me as “ not good enough. ” I 'm afraid you 'll write me off as not “ real enough , ” and most of all I 'm afraid that you 'll ignore everything I 've said and sexualize it .
But luckily those fears pale in comparison to my trust that this is important ; that you 'll be kind , you 'll listen , you 'll discuss , and you 'll share . It 's just a naked body , and I 'm sharing it with you out of love .
I hope that by sharing , you will feel inspired today to let go of some of the layers that you hide your true Self behind . I hope that by baring my heart and body openly , without shame , you will start more discussions about why we all feel the need to hide . Because there is nothing wrong with you that needs fixing or hiding . Our naked bodies are all fundamentally , inherently , and eternally right , and I challenge you to stop running from them . # getmorenaked
I am passionate about helping women learn to love their bodies , but loving your body as a woman in our culture is n't easy , as you know .
That 's why I created the Body Image Alchemy Blueprint :
to help women explore and address the actual blocks that get in the way of truly loving and accepting yourself . If you want to love and accept your body no matter how it looks , but do n't know where to start , this course is for you .
Baking holiday desserts is the most enjoyable thing to do ; if you 're not in the festivities mood yet , the smell filling the house when baking these chocolate sugar cookies will do the job !
These melt in your mouth cookies will be the hit for this year and a staple for the coming years . You can consider it as a homemade gift to family and friends .
This recipe makes a pretty large batch , about 4 1/2 dozens to enjoy ( of course it could be plus or minus depending on the cutters size ) . The most important is to use a good quality of cocoa because it 's all about the chocolate taste .
The recipe calls for :
400g butter unsalted and softened
2 cups sugar
4 1/2 cup all purpose flour sifted
1 1/2 cup cocoa powder sifted
2 large eggs
1 tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla
Cream the butter and sugar together in the bowl of an electric mixer on low to medium speed . Add eggs slowly and mix . Make sure to scrape down the bowl with your spatula and mix again . Add vanilla extract and stir briefly .
Sift your dry ingredients together . ( Flour , cocoa powder and salt ) then add them to the mixture . Mix on low speed , when it clumps around the paddle attachment it 's ready . It 's also important at this stage not to over mix the dough . Place in the fridge for a minimum of 1 hour . Roll out the dough and cut out cookie shapes .
Preheat your oven to 180°C . Bake cookies for 8-12 minutes or until the center of the cookie no longer looks wet . Again the baking time will depend on the size of your cookie .
When baking cookies , I usually line the baking tray with parchment paper , it helps cookies to bake evenly and it 's easy to slide the cookies off of the baking sheet without breaking them . Let cookies cool to room temperature then serve .
This is my first batch , lets see how many more i will be doing before Christmas is here . Happy baking !

Prepare yourself to meet your new favorite food truck , except do n't expect to get any savory treats from this mobile operation .
Launched in March , Finnegans `` Reverse Food Truck '' hopes to collect $ 50,000 in food and donations over the course of seven months by riding around Minnesota in a bright green vehicle and collecting non-perishable items , cash and credit card donations to help the hungry , according to the company 's website .
The concept is a natural fit for the beer company whose mission is to help people in need .
Finnegans has two beers available –- a blonde ale and an Irish amber –- and 100 percent of profits go toward feeding the hungry in the areas where its drinks are sold , according to its Facebook page .
The beers are available in restaurants and liquor stores exclusively in Minnesota , North Dakota , South Dakota and Wisconsin , and the company has made a sizable impact since it was established 14 years ago .
Finnegans has raised more than half a million dollars and donated 91,000 pounds of produce , ABC News reported .
The food truck is expanding the company 's donor pool by giving people the chance to contribute , without having to buy a beer , Angie Lee , marketing coordinator , told NPR .
Whereas most menus tell you how much an entrée is going to cost you , Finnegans ' food truck menu spells out how your donation will help people in need .
For example , $ 5 will buy enough food for two days and $ 25 will allow for the purchase of enough food for two weeks , according to the organization 's website .
The food truck is keeping supporters abreast of its whereabouts via social media .
While some passersby are often confused when they first hit up the food truck , they usually walk away feeling pretty satisfied with the vehicle 's mission .
`` They 'll try and order a hamburger or a taco and we say 'No , we 're actually taking food , ' '' Lee told NPR . `` And then they 're like , 'Oh my gosh , this is the coolest thing ever . ' ''
For the rice grower and miller in southeast Texas , see Joseph Eloi Broussard
Joseph Broussard ( 1702–1765 ) , also known as Beausoleil ( English : Beautiful Sun ) , was a leader of the Acadian people in Acadia ; later Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island , and New Brunswick . Broussard organized a Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias against the British through King George 's War , Father Le Loutre 's War and during the French and Indian War . After the loss of Acadia to the British , they eventually led the first group of Acadians to southern Louisiana in present-day United States . Their name is sometimes presented as Joseph Gaurhept Broussard ; this is likely the result of a transcription error . [ 2 ] Broussard is widely regarded as a hero and an important historical figure by both Acadians and Cajuns .
Life [ edit ]
Broussard was born in Port-Royal , Nova Scotia in 1702 to Jean-François Broussard and Catherine Richard . Their father came from Poitiers and their mother was born in Port Royal . They lived much of their life at Le Cran ( present-day Stoney Creek , Albert County , New Brunswick ) , along the Petitcodiac River with their wife Agnes and their eleven children .
During Father Rale 's War , Broussard participated in a raid on Annapolis Royal , Nova Scotia ( 1724 ) . [ 3 ]
King George 's War [ edit ]
During King George 's War , under the leadership of French priest Jean-Louis Le Loutre , Broussard began actively resisting the British occupation of Acadia . Broussard 's forces often included Mi'kmaq allies in their resistance against the British . In 1747 they participated in and was later charged for their involvement with the Battle of Grand Pré . ( see History of the Acadians ) [ 1 ] [ 4 ]
Father Le Loutre 's War [ edit ]
During Father Le Loutre 's War , after the construction of Fort Beausejour in 1751 , Broussard joined Jean-Louis Le Loutre at Beausejour . In an effort to stop the British movement into Acadia , in 1749 Broussard was involved in one of the first raids on Dartmouth , Nova Scotia which resulted in the deaths of five British settlers . [ 5 ] The following year , Broussard was in the Battle at Chignecto and then shortly afterward they led sixty Mi'kmaq and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again , in what would be known as the `` Dartmouth Massacre '' ( 1751 ) . Broussard and the others killed twenty British civilians and took more prisoners . [ 6 ] Cornwallis temporarily abandoned plans to settle Dartmouth . [ 7 ]
In late April 1754 , Beausoleil and a large band of Mi'kmaq and Acadians left Chignecto for Lawrencetown . They arrived in mid-May and in the night opened fired on the village . Beausoleil killed and scalped four British settlers and two soldiers . By August , as the raids continued , the residents and soldiers were withdrawn to Halifax . [ 8 ]
In the Action of 8 June 1755 , a naval battle off Cape Race , Newfoundland , on board the French ships Alcide and Lys were found 10,000 scalping knives for Acadians and Indians serving under Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope and Acadian Beausoleil as they continue to fight Father Le Loutre 's War . [ 9 ]
Broussard was also active in the fight against Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton in the Battle of Beausejour . [ 10 ]
French and Indian War [ edit ]
With Le Loutre imprisoned after the Battle of Beausejour , Broussard became the leader of an armed resistance during the expulsion of the Acadians ( 1755–1764 ) , leading assaults against the British on several occasions between 1755 and 1758 as part of the forces of Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot . [ 1 ] After arming a ship in 1758 , Broussard traveled through the upper Bay of Fundy region , where they attacked the British . Their ship was seized in November 1758 . They were then forced to flee , travelling first to the Miramichi and later imprisoned at Fort Edward in 1762 . Finally , they were transferred and imprisoned with other Acadians in Halifax , Nova Scotia .
Arrival at Louisiana [ edit ]
Released in 1764 , the year after the signing of the Treaty of Paris , Broussard left Nova Scotia , along with their family and hundreds of other Acadians , to Saint-Domingue ( present-day Haiti ) . [ 11 ] Unable to adapt to the climate and diseases that was killing Acadians , they led the group to settle in Louisiana . [ 12 ]
They were among the first 200 Acadians to arrive in Louisiana on February 27 , 1765 , aboard the Santo Domingo . [ 13 ] On April 8 , 1765 , they were appointed militia captain and commander of the `` Acadians of the Atakapas '' the area around present-day St. Martinville , La . [ 1 ] Not long after their arrival , Joseph Broussard died near what is now St. Martinville at the presumed age of 63 . The exact date of their death is unknown , but it is assumed to have been on or about October 20 , 1765 . Many of their descendants live in southern Louisiana and Nova Scotia .
Descendancy [ edit ]
Broussard 's 21st-century descendants include Célestine `` Tina '' Knowles ( née Beyincé ) , their two daughters Beyoncé and Solange , and also their four grandchildren Jules , Blue , Sir , and Rumi . [ 14 ]
Modern cultural references [ edit ]
The Cajun music group BeauSoleil is named after him .
A New Brunswick group `` Beausoleil Broussard '' was very popular in the 1970s .
They are a character in the novel Banished from Our Home : The Acadian Diary of Angelique Richard , Grand-Pre , Acadia , 1755 ( 2004 ) by Sharon Stewart .
A dramatized , historically inaccurate version of Beausoleil is featured in the Acadian novel Pélagie-la-Charette , by Antonine Maillet .
Part of their militant Acadian hero story is told in the documentary feature `` Zachary Richard , Cajun Heart '' by Acadian director Phil Comeau .

The beating death last month of University of Southern California ( USC ) graduate student Xinran Ji has led to questions from parents and students about security of USC 's campus and surrounding areas .
Ji , 24 , was killed as they were walking home at 12:45 on July 24 by four teenagers , Jonathan DelCarmen , 19 ; Andrew Garcia , 18 ; Alberto Ochoa , 17 ; and Alejandra Guerrero , 16 . Because there was a similar case two years ago wherein two Chinese students were murdered during an attempted robbery , international students and Asian American students are particularly worried and raising their voices to ask for better protection while at school .
According to undergraduate student Sarah Bang , the deaths have caused international students including themselves to feel unsafe .
In an interview with JSR , Bang said , “ The neighborhood is definitely not safe at night . Some services the students can use , such as the Campus Cruiser system [ which offers free rides to students in the area ] , are inconvenient , so many students do not use them . I think those could be improved . ”
Heejung Choi , a parent of a USC student , expressed concern when speaking to JSR .
“ My child goes to a school where cases like murders are happening , ” Choi stated . “ I pay a lot of money for tuition . I would like to see a safer environment for students to study . ”
Choi continued , “ My daughter also studies until late night at the library and walks back to their dorm . I do n't think they are safe anymore . ”
In response to criticism , the school has limited public access to campus and is in the process of upgrading its network of cameras and increasing security staffing .
“ I am still applying for USC , but I think they should strengthen their security during summer , ” said high school senior Joy Basinger to JSR .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - More than a million British workers were given a pay rise on Friday as a higher minimum wage came into force , an economic experiment that fed in to a tense political debate on whether the country should leave the European Union .
City workers walk towards St Paul 's Cathedral as they cross the Millennium footbridge during sunrise in central London , Britain , in this January 14 , 2016 file photo . REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/Files
Chancellor George Osborne last year announced a series of increases in the wage that will make it 13 percent higher than it would otherwise have been by 2020 .
They hope the change will boost productivity and make work more rewarding than welfare . But businesses in the typically low-paying hospitality , retail and social care sectors have said they might cut staff in response .
A government minister who wants Britain to leave the European Union said on Friday the increase would make Britain more attractive for foreign workers at a time when net migration is running far above the government 's target .
Britain holds what is shaping up to be a closely fought referendum on its membership of the bloc on June 23 .
The country 's independent budget forecaster , the OBR , estimates the wage increase will result in 60,000 fewer jobs and increase business costs by around 1 percent of corporate profits .
A survey last year by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation ( REC ) said concerns among employers had already contributed to a slowdown in hiring .
But a separate survey by the Centre for Macroeconomics , a research body , found more than half of 37 leading economists it questioned saw no significant hit to jobs .
MIGRANT MAGNET ?
Osborne , whose political standing has been hurt by two U-turns on planned cuts to welfare payments in recent months , said the change would mean workers aged over 25 and on the minimum wage would get a bigger increase in annual pay than any of their counterparts in the world .
Under the first increase , the minimum wage rose to 7.20 pounds an hour on Friday , up from 6.70 pounds .
“ The National Living Wage will help firms by addressing historic weaknesses in the British economy , ” they wrote in The Sun newspaper . “ Low wages mean little investment in the skills of too many of our workers . ”
Britain first introduced a national minimum wage under Labour prime minister Tony Blair in 1999 , when business leaders warned it would ramp up costs and force companies to hire fewer workers .
Related Coverage How will the National Living Wage impact UK stocks ?
Those fears proved wide of the mark , but culture minister John Whittingdale told the Times newspaper the new increase would act as a magnet for more migrants unless Britain took control of its borders with a vote to leave the EU .
“ Wages in the UK will be so much higher than the rest of Europe , ” they said .
The minimum wage has been used by an increasing number of countries in a bid to boost economic growth , with Germany introducing it in 2015 and Japan announcing plans to increase its version .
Hear those horns in downtown Seattle ? It 's the sound of angry UberX drivers fed up with the way they 're being paid .
The frustrated contractors are gathering outside of Uber 's Seattle office at Smith Tower for a rather loud protest . They are part of a new group called Seattle Ride-Share Drivers Association that met on Wednesday to discuss a recent price reduction Uber has implemented that they claim has lowered their salary .
“ Uber needs to engage with us now , ” association board member Jamal Ahmed told GeekWire this afternoon .
Wow , big Uber protest going on right now in downtown Seattle . pic.twitter.com/eBwFAVnC7P — David Rosenthal ( @ djrosent ) August 29 , 2014

# Uber drivers are protesting outside our office , driving around building honking horns . Both earpieces going in now . # Seattle # SmithTower — Steven Johnson ( @ steveTjohnson ) August 29 , 2014
And then a horn concert courtesy of angry @ Uber drivers # Seattle — Ale Butrón ( @ lunale11 ) August 29 , 2014
Here 's a statement from Uber in regard to today 's protest :
“ Uber offers individuals the freedom , economic opportunity and flexibility to start their own businesses . We remain committed to helping the thousands of Seattle driver partners grow their small businesses . ”
Back in June , Uber lowered prices for UberX customers by 20 percent . For two months , the company continued paying its drivers — who earn 80 percent of each fare — as if the discount had not been implemented .
But earlier this month , Uber shifted the discount over to drivers , who are now making less money per ride .
“ All drivers of the association believe in Uber and want the company to succeed and continue to offer a valuable service to the public , ” the association wrote in a statement this week . “ The Association is concerned that this will not happen unless Uber pays their drivers what they were originally paid . ”
Uber Seattle General Manager Brooke Steger said that even though UberX drivers are making less money per ride , they are earning more total income than ever . Here was their response to the complaints :
Uber 's goal is to ensure strong driver partner earnings and offer the best value to riders . From the summer promotion , we have learned that a 20 percent price cut will keep demand at record levels , with driver earnings equal or higher than May peaks . We have seen similar effects in other cities where lower rates increase trips and increase driver earnings . Drivers are making MORE money now due to demand than they did before the price cut . Uber partner drivers have a direct line into the Uber team and we will continue to work with them individually to ensure their small businesses thrive .
The Seattle Ride-Share Drivers Association , which has 500 members , said Uber 's claim that its drivers are making more overall income is “ unfounded. ” It noted how some drivers , when expenses are accounted for , are actually now losing money when accepting a ride .
“ No sensible person would stop working if they or they are making more money , ” Ahmed told GeekWire on Wednesday .
Uber has been slashing rates for several months as it continues to engage in a price war with companies like Lyft and Sidecar . The San Francisco-based company , which has raised $ 1.5 billion and is now in 205 cities worldwide , made headlines earlier this week for its questionable recruiting tactics in what was yet another example of how competitive this relatively new transportation market has become .
The association plans to continue reaching more UberX drivers .
“ This will not stop until we have reached out to every driver out there , or Uber agrees to meet with us as partners , ” Ahmed said . “ All they have done is ignored every request for dialogue . ”
Friday 's protests have convinced at least one UberX customer to switch to Lyft :
Thanks to the @ Uber protest outside my office downtown Seattle , I 'm switching to Lyft from now on . Stop honking . — Syzlak ( @ Syzlak ) August 29 , 2014
And another who now thinks lesser of Uber :

Funny enough , last year Seattle saw a similar horn-honking protest — only it was from taxi drivers fed up with the city , not drivers from Uber .
Here 's a video from Wednesday 's association meeting , which features drivers complaining about Uber 's recent changes :
For those that have the cash , it keeps getting easier and more compelling to avoid public transit . Private buses like Bridj and Leap Transit crunch data to give people the fastest commute possible . UberPool and Lyft Line find riders going in the same direction to offer an option that 's cheaper than a taxi and as much as twice as fast as waiting as a bus stop .
Public transportation agencies have noticed , and they 're worried about losing riders . Now a startup hopes to help city buses catch up to current technology–and start offering flexible , on-demand services along with the fixed routes that have been standard for the last century .
via TransLoc
“ The almost-universal adoption of mobile technologies has already shifted consumer and rider expectations in many respects , and mass transit is realizing they need to adapt very quickly , ” says Doug Kauffman , CEO of TransLoc , the startup , which is building an app to help agencies quickly identify where riders are actually traveling so cities can start to offer services tailored to those needs .
“ Private transportation is a very popular investment right now , which means there is a big influx of cash and a lot of new companies that are able to innovate very quickly , ” they say . “ This puts a lot of pressure on public transit to respond and establish what role transit will play in the future . ”
Riders using TransLoc 's app , currently a prototype , give it permission to follow their route as they ride . That data builds maps that agencies can use to make routes more efficient , and eventually offer on-demand services . Someone could , for example , someday use the app to request a bus , and the system could quickly crowdsource a route to pick up several riders with a small bus or van .
“ It would help agencies provide a transit service that is truly rider-centric : Vehicles coming to you , on your schedule , taking your location and destination into consideration , ” says Kauffman . “ When asked , most people say they do n't use mass transit because it requires significant time and effort to reach their destination . Take my commute , for example–-by car it 's 10 minutes , by bus it 's 90 minutes . This is not unusual , and it reduces the number of people for whom transit is a good option . We can help transit do better . ”

Some cities , like Helsinki , are already experimenting with similar systems . Transloc thinks that on-demand systems may become common .
NEW DELHI : The roads ministry has proposed to construct 25 leafy underpasses for animal movement as part of 10 national highways that pass through forests and wildlife sanctuaries in order to ensure environmental clearance for the projects.The measures will add to the cost of construction , but that is n't a worry since these will reduce the impact on the natural habitat of animals , a senior National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) official said.These proposed highways would pass through sanctuaries such as the Madhav National Park near Gwalior ; Chambal and the corridors connecting the Kanha and Pench tiger reserves ; Rajaji National Park in Uttarakhand and dense forests of Assam . Cost of construction for these nearly 1,900 km of highways is estimated to be about Rs 20,000 crore.The cave-like , concrete underpasses that the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has proposed will be layered with natural soil so that they resemble the natural habitat of the animals . The underpasses will be fitted with CCTV cameras to monitor the movement of animals.According to a senior ministry official , these structures will be constructed so biodiversity is untouched . Stretches passing through green corridors will have fencing to prevent vehicles from entering the core zone . Speed of vehicles will be restricted to 40 km an hour.The Wildlife Institute of India ( WII ) and National Tiger Conservation Authority have prepared draft guidelines for mitigation of impact of linear projects in forest ranges . For instance , height of underpasses has been suggested to be a minimum of six metres to help elephants.The government is working with the WII to implement these . “ Animals have a set pattern and route of movement according to which special paths underneath the elevated road stretch would be made , ” the NHAI official said . State wildlife boards will also be drafted into the projects .
Willis Carto , a reclusive behind-the-scenes wizard of the far-right fringe of American politics who used lobbying and publishing to denigrate Jews and other minorities and galvanize the movement to deny the Holocaust , died last Monday at their home in Virginia . They were 89 .
Their death was announced by The American Free Press , a newspaper they helped found .
Mr. Carto raised funds to finance a right-wing military dictatorship in the United States , campaigned to persuade blacks to voluntarily return to Africa and , most influentially , started newsletters , a journal and conferences of academics and others to deny the scale , and even the existence , of the Holocaust .
The Anti-Defamation League called them “ one of the most influential American anti-Semitic propagandists ” and “ the mastermind of the hate network . ”
Their associates included neo-Nazis , Christian vigilantes , John Birch Society members and Ku Klux Klansmen , and their extreme views alienated mainstream conservatives . After William F. Buckley sued Mr. Carto for libel and won in 1985 , Mr. Buckley said Mr. Carto epitomized “ the fever swamps of the crazed right . ''

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited Leamington today as they aimed to win over voters in the Conservative seat with a rousing speech .
Hundreds of supporters filled the area outside Leamington Town Hall with the crowd even spilling into the road forcing police to direct traffic around people standing on The Parade .
The Warwick and Leamington constituency is currently held by Conservative Chris White who won the 2015 by a majority of almost 7,000 from Labour 's Lynnette Kelly .
It would take an almost inconceivable swing for the Labour Party to wrest control of the seat from the Tories -but Mr Corbyn urged supporters not to write off their party just yet .
( Image : Russell Whitehead photography www.russellwhitehead.com )
Here are five key things we took from Mr Corbyn 's visit and their 10-minute speech .
1 ) He 's popular . More than 200 people were at the rally outside Leamington Town Hall , along with much of the national press .
There 's no denying Mr Corbyn has pull , but is it enough to make them the next Prime Minister ?
2 ) In a climate where many of the polls say Labour are heading for a landslide defeat , Mr Corbyn reminded us he 's beaten the odds before .
They said : “ We 've got one month today until the General Election . Many of the media have written people off in the past .
“ Indeed , I started out at 200/1 to be leader of the Labour Party . ”
3 ) They support Arsenal , as does Labour 's parliamentary candidate for Warwick and Leamington , Matt Western .
That was not a fact that was particularly popular when it was brought up by Mr Western as they introduced the Labour leader with many of Mr Corbyn 's supporters engaging in some light-hearted booing .
Mr Corbyn said : “ I 'm sorry if our support for a particular football team causes any controversy .
“ But , you know what ? You have to stick to your beliefs ! ”
( Image : Russell Whitehead photography www.russellwhitehead.com )
4 ) Mr Corbyn thinks Warwick and Leamington is an important seat .
They said : “ Winning Warwick and Leamington , winning here , gives us a chance of forming a Labour government that will do things very differently in this country . ”
They added : “ Make sure that we win Warwick and Leamington . By winning Warwick and Leamington , that 's a message to the whole country .
“ We are strong , we are healthy , we 're in great heart , we 're going to go out there with a message .
“ For the many , not the few . ”
5 ) They used Mental Health Awareness week to issue a message about the importance of speaking openly about mental health issues .
They said : “ There are many going through a mental health crisis who are not getting the support that they need .
“ A quarter of us in our lifetime will face a mental health crisis .
“ We need to have a service that 's able to help and support us .
“ We also need a society and a community that does n't stigmatise people going through a mental health crisis .
“ We have shown that we are very serious about this by appointing Barbara Keeley to my shadow cabinet to represent the needs of social care and mental health in our society . It 's that serious , we have got to deal with it . ”

Jorge Lorenzo hailed `` another great day '' in which they continued to adapt at speed to the increased power and different characteristics of Ducati 's GP17 at Sepang , and stated that , in its current guise , this machine can win races .
After a difficult first day , Lorenzo dropped their pace by eight tenths of a second on Tuesday . The three-time MotoGP world champion enjoyed a similar progression a day later , as they skimmed a further 0.717s off their personal best to finish as the tenth fastest rider across the three days .
Along with testing a host of items on Ducati 's all-new bike , Lorenzo conducted a 19-lap race simulation , which underlined how well they have adapted from Monday to Wednesday , even if it was some way off Marc Marquez 's ominous late run .
`` [ It was ] Another great day for us , '' proclaimed Lorenzo . `` Position is not fantastic but again , a big improvement in the lap time , and understanding of the bike . Every time I feel better and better , and can be faster .
`` I tried something also with the new bike . We made a simulation also with the new bike , even if we did n't adjust the bike , just made two laps , a small run , and then did the simulation .
`` It was not perfect , the bike was not adjusted very well , but anyway , it was a good thing to make a lot of laps in a row and to understand many things .
`` We already changed so many things . I needed to ride the bike a little more aggressively , more on-off with the throttle and also in braking .
`` Also the bike needs to improve in some areas that Gigi [ Dall'Igna - Ducati Corse 's project leader ] and the engineers know . But also we have a lot of strong points that we can take profit from in the future . ''
Asked to judge where they currently stand in the adaption process , Lorenzo continued , `` It 's a question of time . It was a big shock the first day , and I felt that maybe I needed more time than I expected .
`` But finally , a big improvement in just two days . I think we are still very far from our limit , but this is a good thing , because we are far from our limit but we are already fast . That means that when we get there we will be very , very fast . This is what we expect . ''
And what of Ducati 's potential to win a championship in 2017 ? `` I think at this moment , without any modification - in the future we will improve some of the points we have to improve - we can win races .
`` I do n't know about the championship but we can win races . But to win more races we need to improve some of the points that need improvement , and then the result will come together . ''
When testing in Valencia , Lorenzo had the luxury of picking the brain of Casey Stoner , who had been watching the Majorcan 's first laps on a Ducati from trackside .
While Stoner was also present at Sepang , it was Ducati 's lesser known test rider , Michele Pirro , who impressed Lorenzo with their trackside observations and explanations .
Thus , Pirro will act as Lorenzo 's rider coach from now on , a role that ex-grand prix winner Wilco Zeelenberg had fulfilled in the past .
`` Wilco is amazing , as a person and as an explainer , '' said Lorenzo . `` He explains very well and I became world champion also thanks to him .
`` I 'm very surprised with Michele , because finally we decided to have them as a track analyst , because they ride the same bike as me and also with competitive lap times .
`` He knows exactly what to do to adapt yourself very quickly , because they stayed here four or five years , and at the beginning , they felt more or less the same as me , because they also prefer to have corner speed .
`` So they gave me advice , and finally , using their advice works on the track . So very happy with Michele and we will form a great team in the future . ''

If I have n't convinced you yet that category theory is all about morphisms then I have n't done my job properly . Since the next topic is adjunctions , which are defined in terms of isomorphisms of hom-sets , it makes sense to review our intuitions about the building blocks of hom-sets . Also , you 'll see that adjunctions provide a more general language to describe a lot of constructions we 've studied before , so it might help to review them too .
Functors
To begin with , you should really think of functors as mappings of morphisms — the view that 's emphasized in the Haskell definition of the Functor typeclass , which revolves around fmap . Of course , functors also map objects — the endpoints of morphisms — otherwise we would n't be able to talk about preserving composition . Objects tell us which pairs of morphisms are composable . The target of one morphism must be equal to the source of the other — if they are to be composed . So if we want the composition of morphisms to be mapped to the composition of lifted morphisms , the mapping of their endpoints is pretty much determined .
Commuting Diagrams
A lot of properties of morphisms are expressed in terms of commuting diagrams . If a particular morphism can be described as a composition of other morphisms in more than one way , then we have a commuting diagram .
In particular , commuting diagrams form the basis of almost all universal constructions ( with the notable exceptions of the initial and terminal objects ) . We 've seen this in the definitions of products , coproducts , various other ( co- ) limits , exponential objects , free monoids , etc .
The product is a simple example of a universal construction . We pick two objects a and b and see if there exists an object c , together with a pair of morphisms p and q , that has the universal property of being their product .
A product is a special case of a limit . A limit is defined in terms of cones . A general cone is built from commuting diagrams . Commutativity of those diagrams may be replaced with a suitable naturality condition for the mapping of functors . This way commutativity is reduced to the role of the assembly language for the higher level language of natural transformations .
Natural Transformations
In general , natural transformations are very convenient whenever we need a mapping from morphisms to commuting squares . Two opposing sides of a naturality square are the mappings of some morphism f under two functors F and G . The other sides are the components of the natural transformation ( which are also morphisms ) .
Naturality means that when you move to the “ neighboring ” component ( by neighboring I mean connected by a morphism ) , you 're not going against the structure of either the category or the functors . It does n't matter whether you first use a component of the natural transformation to bridge the gap between objects , and then jump to its neighbor using the functor ; or the other way around . The two directions are orthogonal . A natural transformation moves you left and right , and the functors move you up and down or back and forth — so to speak . You can visualize the image of a functor as a sheet in the target category . A natural transformation maps one such sheet corresponding to F , to another , corresponding to G .
We 've seen examples of this orthogonality in Haskell . There the action of a functor modifies the content of a container without changing its shape , while a natural transformation repackages the untouched contents into a different container . The order of these operations does n't matter .
We 've seen the cones in the definition of a limit replaced by natural transformations . Naturality ensures that the sides of every cone commute . Still , a limit is defined in terms of mappings between cones . These mappings must also satisfy commutativity conditions . ( For instance , the triangles in the definition of the product must commute . )
These conditions , too , may be replaced by naturality . You may recall that the universal cone , or the limit , is defined as a natural transformation between the ( contravariant ) hom-functor :
F : : c - > C ( c , Lim D )
and the ( also contravariant ) functor that maps objects in C to cones , which themselves are natural transformations :
G : : c - > Nat ( Δ c , D )
Here , Δ c is the constant functor , and D is the functor that defines the diagram in C. Both functors F and G have well defined actions on morphisms in C. It so happens that this particular natural transformation between F and G is an isomorphism .
Natural Isomorphisms
A natural isomorphism — which is a natural transformation whose every component is reversible — is category theory 's way of saying that “ two things are the same. ” A component of such a transformation must be an isomorphism between objects — a morphism that has the inverse . If you visualize functor images as sheets , a natural isomorphism is a one-to-one invertible mapping between those sheets .
Hom-Sets
But what are morphisms ? They do have more structure than objects : unlike objects , morphisms have two ends . But if you fix the source and the target objects , the morphisms between the two form a boring set ( at least for locally small categories ) . We can give elements of this set names like f or g , to distinguish one from another — but what is it , really , that makes them different ?
The essential difference between morphisms in a given hom-set lies in the way they compose with other morphisms ( from abutting hom-sets ) . If there is a morphism h whose composition ( either pre- or post- ) with f is different than that with g , for instance :
h ∘ f ≠ h ∘ g
then we can directly “ observe ” the difference between f and g . But even if the difference is not directly observable , we might use functors to zoom in on the hom-set . A functor F may map the two morphisms to distinct morphisms :
F f ≠ F g
in a richer category , where the abutting hom-sets provide more resolution , e.g. ,
h ' ∘ F f ≠ h ' ∘ F g
where h ' is not in the image of F .
Hom-Set Isomorphisms
A lot of categorical constructions rely on isomorphisms between hom-sets . But since hom-sets are just sets , a plain isomorphism between them does n't tell you much . For finite sets , an isomorphism just says that they have the same number of elements . If the sets are infinite , their cardinality must be the same . But any meaningful isomorphism of hom-sets must take into account composition . And composition involves more than one hom-set . We need to define isomorphisms that span whole collections of hom-sets , and we need to impose some compatibility conditions that interoperate with composition . And a natural isomorphism fits the bill exactly .
But what 's a natural isomorphism of hom-sets ? Naturality is a property of mappings between functors , not sets . So we are really talking about a natural isomorphism between hom-set-valued functors . These functors are more than just set-valued functors . Their action on morphisms is induced by the appropriate hom-functors . Morphisms are canonically mapped by hom-functors using either pre- or post-composition ( depending on the covariance of the functor ) .
The Yoneda embedding is one example of such an isomorphism . It maps hom-sets in C to hom-sets in the functor category ; and it 's natural . One functor in the Yoneda embedding is the hom-functor in C and the other maps objects to sets of natural transformations between hom-sets .
The definition of a limit is also a natural isomorphism between hom-sets ( the second one , again , in the functor category ) :
C ( c , Lim D ) ≃ Nat ( Δ c , D )
It turns out that our construction of an exponential object , or that of a free monoid , can also be rewritten as a natural isomorphism between hom-sets .
This is no coincidence — we 'll see next that these are just different examples of adjunctions , which are defined as natural isomorphisms of hom-sets .
Asymmetry of Hom-Sets
There is one more observation that will help us understand adjunctions . Hom-sets are , in general , not symmetric . A hom-set C ( a , b ) is often very different from the hom-set C ( b , a ) . The ultimate demonstration of this asymmetry is a partial order viewed as a category . In a partial order , a morphism from a to b exists if and only if a is less than or equal to b . If a and b are different , then there can be no morphism going the other way , from b to a . So if the hom-set C ( a , b ) is non-empty , which in this case means it 's a singleton set , then C ( b , a ) must be empty , unless a = b . The arrows in this category have a definite flow in one direction .
A preorder , which is based on a relation that 's not necessarily antisymmetric , is also “ mostly ” directional , except for occasional cycles . It 's convenient to think of an arbitrary category as a generalization of a preoder .
A preorder is a thin category — all hom-sets are either singletons or empty . We can visualize a general category as a “ thick ” preorder .
Challenges
Consider some degenerate cases of a naturality condition and draw the appropriate diagrams . For instance , what happens if either functor F or G map both objects a and b ( the ends of f : : a - > b ) to the same object , e.g. , F a = F b or G a = G b ? ( Notice that you get a cone or a co-cone this way . ) Then consider cases where either F a = G a or F b = G b . Finally , what if you start with a morphism that loops on itself — f : : a - > a ?
Next : Adjunctions .

Perhaps they were jealous that Ben Carson was getting all the attention for bogus trademark claims ?
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to stop StopTrump.us , a website that sells a variety of anti-Trump paraphernalia , including T-shirts and other doodads that have slogans like `` Donald is Dumb '' and `` Stop Trump . '' Their lawyer has sent a cease-and-desist letter ordering the website to stop selling its anti-Trump wares and hand over the domain name .
`` As I am sure you are aware , the Trump ( R ) name is internationally known and famous as a result of Mr. Trump 's long , extensive , and high-profile business and entertainment related activities , '' writes Trump 's general counsel , Alan Garten , in the letter , which was obtained by The Huffington Post . `` It has come to our attention that you have registered the Domain Name STOPTRUMP.US and have made a deliberate attempt to sell T-shirts online using TRUMP and DONALD TRUMP brands without any authorization from Mr . Trump . ''
`` Mr Trump considers this to be a very serious matter , '' Garten concludes . Trump `` has authorized our legal team to take all necessary and appropriate actions to bring an immediate halt to your blatant and unauthorized use of their trademark . ''
Washington Post blogger and law professor Eugene Volokh points out that Trump has no case whatsoever . No one will be confused into thinking that the `` Stop Trump '' website or its gear for sale is authorized by Trump ; and even if someone was confused , the trademark confusion and cybersquatting laws both allow for fair use , and criticism is the classic example .
Still , some trademark bullies get away with it just by being bigger than their targets and using legal language in a threatening manner . That seems extremely unlikely to happen here . Trump is n't the only campaign team with lawyers . As the political season heats up , the Massachusetts-based activists behind StopTrump.us are likely to have offers of help from lawyers on the opposite side of the political spectrum .
`` The lawsuit is pure publicity gold for the business , '' writes Volokh . `` What a brilliant marketing tactic by the T-shirt people — but why is the Trump campaign playing along ? ''
The trademark letter is the second cease-and-desist sent out by the Trump team in the last few days . Politico reported yesterday that Trump sent a letter to the conservative group Club for Growth , which has begun airing commercials on what it views as their too-liberal record on issues like health care . Trump says those ads are `` replete with outright lies , false , defamatory and destructive statements and downright fabrications . ''
Club for Growth President David McIntosh responded that Trump should `` grow up '' and `` stop whining . ''
Iâ€™m not afraid to say it : Gordon Bombay was a bad coach . If not for the leadership on the teams they managed , Iâ€™m confident that Bombay may have never led a championship team .
Charlie Conway was the true team leader . They brought them together . When Adam Banks came back from their wrist injury , it wasnâ€™t replacement Russ Tyler who gave up their jersey . No , it was the real leader of the Ducks , Number 96 .
Bombayâ€™s up-and-down attitude led to multiple defeats throughout their coaching tenure . If not for Jan , the brother of Bombay 's mentor , bringing them back to Earth multiple times , we may have never even seen a USA versus Iceland match in the Junior Goodwill Games finals .
But do you know why â€ “ more than any other reason â€ “ I know Coach Bombay was terrible ? They played Greg Goldberg over Julie â€œThe Catâ€ Gaffney for the entirety of the Junior Goodwill Games ! Thatâ€™s like Leslie Frazier deciding to play Toby Gerhart instead of Adrian Peterson . Or Mike McCarthy giving Graham Harrell the nod over Aaron Rodgers .
The Cat was clearly the better talent , and it showed when they gloved Gunnar Stahl 's slapper in the Goodwill Gamesâ€™ championship . Whether you believe in the theory that Bombay was sexist or not , thereâ€™s no denying that Team USA had a better chance of winning with Gaffney in net .
That got me thinking : Can we learn from Bombayâ€™s glaring mistake ? In fantasy football terms , are there teammates playing the same position being completely undervalued or overvalued ? Are there running back peers , for instance , where the lesser-known , potential backup commodity is actually a better draft day value ?
There are . And Iâ€™ve dubbed them the Julie â€œThe Catâ€ Gaffneys of 2013 fantasy football .
Jordy Nelson is â€œThe Catâ€ to Randall Cobb
This isnâ€™t to say Jordy Nelson is Randall Cobbâ€™s backup , but Cobb is certainly going for a pricier rate than Nelson in fantasy drafts . And we do like Cobb more than Jordy ; just not at their current costs . Cobbâ€™s ADP is listed at 3.07 according to FantasyFootballCalculator.com , which is more than two rounds higher than Nelsonâ€™s . Much of this has to do with Nelsonâ€™s out-of-nowhere knee surgery , but even before they went under the knife , Nelsonâ€™s cost was a round later than Cobbâ€™s .
Jordy is expecting and hopeful to be back Week 1 , so the injury may end up being nothing . If heâ€™s healthy , heâ€™s capable of being a sound WR2 in 12-team leagues . Cobbâ€™s being selected as a WR1 ( the eighth wideout selected ) , which is completely inflated considering our projections . Weâ€™ve got Cobb down for 85 receptions , 1,175 yards and nine scores , while we see Jordy hauling in 77 catches for 1,083 yards and almost 10 touchdowns .
Nelsonâ€™s health will play a major role , but Jordyâ€™s knee is independent of Cobbâ€™s overblown value . Itâ€™s not as though you have to trust Nelson during your draft , but feeling good about making a third-round selection on Cobb would be like having confidence in Goldberg to stop Icelandâ€™s Gunnar Stahl .
BenJarvus Green-Ellis is â€œThe Catâ€ to Giovani Bernard
I know , I know , Gio Bernard has been lighting up the stat sheet in the preseason for the Bengals . Heâ€™s been the Adam Banks of Cincinnatiâ€™s team . But donâ€™t overlook the plodding BenJarvus Green-Ellis , who will still see touches themselves in the Bengals ' offense .
Bernard hasnâ€™t exactly been the inside runner that Green-Ellis is , giving The Law Firm a nice advantage on early downs . Green-Ellis is also the starter on the team , making this an interesting `` Cat '' situation . According to ADP data , Gio is being drafted at 5.07 versus Green-Ellis at 7.12 . I understand the upside appeal , but it seems like BJGE may be the better value , considering players like Ronnie Hillman are leaving the draft board less than half a round later than him .
The projections and algorithms here at numberFire actually like Green-Ellis flat out more than Bernard this season . Keep in mind : We may see Green-Ellis as a boring runner ( which they kind of is ) , but they ranked in the top 50 percent in rushing efficiency last season .
Now , if Bernardâ€™s projected attempts increase by the start of the season , this could change a bit . However , given the type of talent available in Round 5 , Bernard doesnâ€™t seem like the kind of back to take there unless itâ€™s a deep , PPR-heavy league .
Pierre Thomas is â€œThe Catâ€ to Mark Ingram
Iâ€™ve already put my thoughts together on why I think Thomas is the better value when compared to their counterpart , but let me hit on some of the highlights . Mark Ingram has yet to finish in the top quarter in terms of rushing efficiency , something Pierre Thomas ( and Chris Ivory ) has done consistently over the last two seasons . To determine this , I looked at the playersâ€™ rushing net expected points per attempt , which analyzes how many points these runners were adding towards their teamâ€™s point total on a per-carry basis . Thomasâ€™ number blew Ingram out of the water .
Oh , and PT is the superior pass catcher , too .
Itâ€™s a no brainer for me : Pierre Thomas , even if they finish with a worse rank than Ingram , is the better value during your draft considering their difference in average draft positions ( 2.5 rounds ) .
For more on Thomas and Ingram , click here .
Andre Brown is â€œThe Catâ€ to David Wilson
Giants running back David Wilson impressed in their second preseason game , showing signs that they should be able to be a nice threat catching the ball out of the backfield this season . Teammate Andre Brown matched Wilson with eight attempts against Indianapolis , rushing for just a few more yards , and entered the game on third downs . As beat writers , analysts and head coach Tom Coughlin have been saying , the running back situation in New York could be a full blown running back-by-committee system this year .
At the end of the season , we should expect to see David Wilson come out with more opportunity and fantasy points , but that doesnâ€™t mean heâ€™s the better value pick in your draft . Heâ€™s leaving drafts in the third round , the 22nd runner off the board , while Andre Brown is typically joining teams in the seventh , as the 34th running back selection . Interestingly enough , thatâ€™s almost precisely where we have them ranked here at numberFire .
So why view Brown as the better value ?
Upside . Of the relevant running backs last season , Andre Brown was best running the ball . They had a rushing net expected points total of 19.14 , which equated to .26 on a per-attempt basis . That was much better than Wilsonâ€™s -.03 . This means that Andre Brown was adding points to the Giants offensive score at a rapid pace , while Wilson was actually below average .
Aside from that , the biggest reason to view Brown as the one with more worth is because of opportunity cost . When you select David Wilson , youâ€™re forgoing an opportunity to have the potential elite talent at wide receiver . And remember : you still may be able to find sound , comparable running back options in the fourth round of your draft , and if thatâ€™s the case , drafting Wilson wonâ€™t do you much good .
Comparing Andre Brown to their ADP competition , the upside doesnâ€™t appear nearly as close . The asupervisorstioned BenJarvus Green-Ellis is present around Brownâ€™s ADP , but outside of him , youâ€™re looking at players like Ben Tate . Give me Brown all day .
Iâ€™ve continuously said that thereâ€™s a chance both David Wilson and Andre Brown reach their ADP potential this season . However , because thereâ€™s less room for error for Wilson , I believe Brownâ€™s the one who could come in win the championship for you this year .

A complaint has been filed with the Department of Justice 's Civil Rights Division against Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump over allegations that Trump bribed Bondi to get them drop an investigation into Trump University .
The complaint filed by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump asks for a DOJ investigation into Trump and Bondi , “ The complaint read : “ We believe that Pam Bondi , Florida Attorney General , and Donald Trump have violated federal voting laws including but not limited to bribery across state lines by way of a $ 25,000 campaign contribution from Trump to Bondi during their 2013 election by way of the Trump Foundation in return for AG Bondi dropping an investigation into Trump University . We ask the DOJ to investigate this matter and appreciate their rapid response . Thank you . ”
Calls for a criminal probe are growing on both the left and the right . Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post asked why Trump was n't already under investigation for bribery .
Rubin wrote , “ One can not miss the giant red flag . Why is a charity giving money to aid a pol with whom the foundation 's head has pending legal business ? Recall that after the gift was received an official act occurred , the very act Trump had been seeking , namely the decision not to proceed with the case against Trump University . Right there you have a prima facie case of bribery– a payment ( an illegal one at that ) and a quid pro quo . ”
What Trump and Bondi did was about a clear a case of bribing a public official as it gets . Trump should have already been under investigation for bribery , and their status as one of the two people who could be elected as the next US president makes it vital for the FBI or the Department of Justice to put potential concerns about partisan howls aside and investigate the possible criminal activity of the Republican nominee .
The future of our republic could depend on it .

SteamVR and 3DMark
Time for some synthetic benchmarks ! First up : The SteamVR performance test , which serves as the only major virtual reality standard until more benchmarking tools hit the streets . The SteamVR performance test is better thought of as a gauge for your graphics card 's relative virtual reality performance—and as a pass/fail test for determining whether your rig can handle VR whatsoever—than it is for making head-to-head GPU comparisons .
The Nitro+ RX 480 clocks in with a higher average fidelity rating than the reference RX 480 and is definitely VR-ready , although it does n't score quite as high as the pricier GTX 1060 . That 's not a big surprise , though , as Nvidia 's cards score consistently higher across the board in the SteamVR performance test than AMD hardware does .
3DMark Fire Strike and Time Spy
We also tested the GTX 1060 and its rivals using 3DMark 's highly respected DX11 Fire Strike synthetic benchmark , which runs at 1080p , as well as its brand-new Time Spy benchmark , which tests DirectX 12 performance at 2560x1440 resolution .
Sapphire 's Nitro+ RX 480 gets a healthy boost thanks to its mild overclock , bringing the card within spitting range of the GTX 1060 in Fire Strike and far surpassing both the GTX 1060 and the stock RX 480 in Time Spy .

WICHITA – Struggling aircraft maker Hawker Beechcraft announced Monday that it had reached a $ 1.79 billion `` exclusivity agreement '' with a Chinese aerospace manufacturer for the sale of its business jet and general aviation operations in a deal that will save thousands of jobs in Kansas and Arkansas .
Under the agreement Beijing-based aerospace manufacturer Superior Aviation Beijing Co. , Ltd. , will buy Hawker Beechcraft and make payments over the next six weeks to support ongoing operations until the deal is finalized .
The sale does not include Hawker Beechcraft Defense Co. , which will remain a separate entity .
If the transaction is completed , Superior intends to maintain Hawker Beechcraft 's existing operations while putting `` substantial capital '' into the company and its business and general aviation product line , saving thousands of American jobs , the company said .
Hawker Beechcraft filed for bankruptcy protection in May to expedite a prearranged restructuring of the company and some of its subsidiaries . Hawker Beechcraft Corp. , which is owned by GS Capital Partners and Onex Partners , has struggled with tepid demand for its military planes and business jets .
The company employs about 7,400 people , with roughly 4,700 working at its Wichita , Kan. , facility . It also has factories in Little Rock , Ark. , the U.K. and Mexico , as well as more than 100 service centers worldwide .
Steve Rooney , president of the local for the machinists union , did not immediately return a call for comment .
Robert Miller , CEO of Hawker Beechcraft Inc. , said in a news release that Superior first approached Hawker Beechcraft years ago regarding a potential partnership . They cited Superior 's `` demonstrated ability to quickly restore a business to profitability after emerging from Chapter 11 '' and said a transaction with Superior would maximize value for Hawker Beechcraft and its stakeholders .
`` Importantly , this combination would give Hawker Beechcraft greater access to the Chinese business and general aviation marketplace , which is forecast to grow more than 10 percent a year for the next 10 to 15 years , '' Miller said .
Bill Boisture , chairperson of Hawker Beechcraft Corp. , said Superior 's bid for the company was the most attractive received during Hawker 's strategic review . Its plan also offered the most continuity for Hawker Beechcraft , allowing the company to preserve jobs and product lines and maintain commitments to customers .
Under the agreement , Superior intends to make Hawker Beechcraft its flagship investment , maintain its U.S. headquarters , management team and employees and continue product development throughout its lines . If the parties negotiate a definitive agreement during the 45-day exclusivity period , it would be subject to an auction , Hawker said .
While neither ownership nor control of Hawker Beechcraft Defense Co. , will transfer to Superior , up to $ 400 million of the $ 1.79 billion purchase price will be refundable to Superior in the event HBDC is sold .
The deal is also subject to regulatory approvals from the Chinese and U.S. officials . Bankruptcy court approval is also required .
If the deal collapses , Hawker Beechcraft said it will proceed with its bankruptcy reorganization plan to emerge as a stand-alone company .
Superior Aviation is 60 percent owned by Beijing Superior Aviation Technology Corp. , Ltd , a closely held private entity , and 40 percent by Beijing E-Town International Investment & Development Corp. , Ltd , a company controlled by the Beijing municipal government .
Since its founding and highly leveraged 2007 purchase of Raytheon Aircraft , Hawker Beechcraft has carried a heavy debt burden , reporting total debt of $ 2.3 billion at the end of 2011 , according to its annual statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Hawker Beechcraft said that the proposed combination of Hawker Beechcraft and Superior `` will not require a financing condition . ''
In December 2010 , Hawker Beechcraft struck a deal with state and local officials to keep its aircraft operations and at least 4,000 jobs in Kansas until 2020 in exchange for $ 45 million in incentives .
On Monday , the only comment from the Kan. Gov . Sam Brownback 's office was a one-line response sent in an email : `` The state is following the situation closely . ''
Also monitoring the situation are city leaders in Wichita , who also issued a brief statement saying they would work diligently to protect the city 's investment and aviation jobs .
`` At this time , the City is working to gain a better understanding of how the proposed acquisition may impact our community , '' Mayor Carl Brewer said . `` We understand the financial challenges Hawker has faced and are optimistic this acquisition could preserve jobs and help Hawker avoid difficult financial decisions . ''
Hawker Beechcraft traces its Kansas roots to Beech Aircraft Corp. , a company founded by Walter and Olive Ann Beech that began making aircraft in the 1930s .
The juvenile specimen is wonderfully preserved
The female Australopithecus afarensis bones are from the same species as an adult skeleton found in 1974 which was nicknamed `` Lucy '' .
Scientists are thrilled with the find , reported in the journal Nature .
They believe the near-complete remains offer a remarkable opportunity to study growth and development in an important extinct human ancestor .
Juvenile Australopithecus afarensis remains are vanishingly rare .
The skeleton was first identified in 2000 , locked inside a block of sandstone . It has taken five years of painstaking work to free the bones .
`` The Dikika fossil is now revealing many secrets about Australopithecus afarensis and other early hominins , because the fossil evidence was not there , '' said dig leader Zeresenay Alemseged , of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
Delicate bones
The find consists of the whole skull , the entire torso and important parts of the upper and lower limbs . CT scans reveal unerupted teeth still in the jaw , a detail that makes scientists think the individual may have been about three years old when they died .
This puts afarensis in a special position to play a pivotal role in the story of what we are and where we come from
Zeresenay Alemseged , Max Planck Institute
Judging by how well it was preserved , the skeleton may have come from a body that was quickly buried by sediment in a flood , the researchers said .
`` In my opinion , afarensis is a very good transitional species for what was before four million years ago and what came after three million years , '' Dr Alemseged told BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh .
`` [ The species had ] a mixture of ape-like and human-like features . This puts afarensis in a special position to play a pivotal role in the story of what we are and where we come from . ''
Climbing ability
This early ancestor possessed primitive teeth and a small brain but it stood upright and walked on two feet .
There is considerable argument about whether the Dikika girl could also climb trees like an ape .
The lower limbs show the Dikika girl could walk upright
But the question is whether such features indicate climbing ability or are just `` evolutionary baggage '' .
The Dikika girl had an estimated brain size of 330 cubic centimetres when they died , which is not very different from that of a similarly aged chimpanzee . However , when compared to the adult afarensis values , it forms 63 - 88 % of the adult brain size .
This is lower than that of an adult chimp , where by the age of three , over 90 % of the brain is formed . This relatively slow brain growth in the Dikika girl appears to be slightly closer to that of humans .
Slow , gradual development in an extended childhood is regarded as a very human trait - probably to enable our higher functions to develop .
Professor Fred Spoor of University College London said the find would give scientists a `` detailed insight into how our distant relatives grew up and behaved ... at a time of human evolution when they looked a good deal more like bipedal chimpanzees than like us . ''
Dr Jonathan Wynn of the University of St Andrews , UK , and colleagues at the University of South Florida dated the sediments surrounding the remains and came up with an age of 3.3 million years .
The `` Lucy '' skeleton , discovered in Hadar , Ethiopia , in 1974 belongs to the same species as the Dikika girl . For more than 20 years it was the oldest human ancestor known to science .
There has been a recent breakthrough in organic memristors , indicating that we may see the adoption of this technology in the not too distant future . The problems with previously developed memristors were that they were too slow to change states and unable to hold the memory of that state for long enough to be useful . This new type of memristor can switch states in 30ns or less , comparable to traditional resistors and it is capable of holding that state for over 11.5 days without any power . This memristor is also quite stable , with an expected lifetime of 10^12 cycles . One of the driving forces behind the development of a memristor which can perform as well as a traditional resistor is cost , memristors are much less expensive to make and do not require rare metals in their manufacture .

China 's defence minister Chang Wanquan has warned the military , police and the public to prepare for a `` people 's war at sea '' as tensions over the South China Sea dispute escalated .
The comments come weeks after The Hague ruled against China 's historic claims over the disputed maritime asset , stating the country had violated the Philippines ' sovereign rights through its activities in the region .
Urging the country to prepare for mobilisation to `` safeguard sovereignty '' , Wanguan called for recognition of the `` seriousness of the national security situation '' .
According to the country 's official Xinhua News Agency , Beijing has placed emphasis on a `` threat from the sea '' and maritime security threats , calling for the public to be educated on national defence issues .
In recent months , China has increased military activity in the disputed seas , causing concern for its smaller neighbours and becoming a source of confrontation with the United States . China dismissed The Hague 's South China Sea ruling , noting that it does not have jurisdiction over the dispute .
Ahead of The Hague 's decision , a spokesperson for China 's Defence Ministry said : `` Chinese armed forces will firmly safeguard national sovereignty , security and maritime interests and rights , firmly uphold regional peace and stability , and deal with all kinds of threats and challenges . ''
In an attempt to emphasise its right over the waters , China has organised for a video on the territorial dispute to be played 120 times a day in New York 's Times Square . The footage features experts explaining why China has `` indisputable territorial sovereignty and rights '' over the South China Sea and runs for just over three minutes .
State-run Chinese media reported : `` The video clarifies the truth behind the arbitration tribunal farce and reiterates that disputes in the South China Sea should be settled through negotiations . The video features several experts and officials worldwide who defend China 's position on the South China Sea dispute . ''
On 2 August , China 's Defence Ministry reacted angrily to accusations from Japan that the Chinese military was destabalising the regional military balance by attempting to change the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea .

A federal lawsuit accuses a former Murray County , Ga. , judge of concocting a scheme to plant drugs on the woman whose ethics complaint led to their resignation .
Angela Garmley 's ethics complaint ended the careers of Chief Magistrate Bryant Cochran and two sheriff 's deputies . In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Rome , Ga. , their attorneys point to Cochran as the one behind their false arrest .
`` He was obviously the mastermind of planting the drugs and the arrest using two different groups of people , '' said McCracken Poston , one of Garmley 's attorneys .
State investigators said Garmley was set up when Murray County sheriff 's officers found a metal can filled with methamphetamine under their car . The arresting officers -- Capt . Michael Henderson and Deputy Josh Greeson -- were fired , and earlier this year hauled up on federal obstruction charges .
Cochran , who resigned in August and still is under federal investigation , has denied any part in Garmley 's arrest .
Garmley filed the ethics complaint against Cochran in July , alleging the judge had asked them to be their mistress and solicited them for sex when they came to their office asking for warrants to be taken out on three people .
A day before Cochran resigned , Garmley was pulled over by Greeson and Henderson , who is the judge 's cousin . They were arrested along with their husband , Joe , and Jason Southern , but the Georgia Bureau of Investigation dropped charges after agents learned the drugs had been planted .
Now the Garmleys and Southern want Cochran , the officers and multiple county agencies to pay for conspiracy , negligence and abuse of power allegations and are asking for a jury to decide on a sum .
The lawsuit also names county government , the sheriff 's office and former Sheriff Howard Ensley for negligence and not properly training their staffs .
The suit also accuses county officials of not changing their policies after a Murray County employee sued former Commissioner David Ridley for sexual harassment two years ago . The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount .
County officials declined Wednesday to comment on Garmley 's lawsuit and said an attorney has n't been assigned to represent the county .
Murray County Attorney Greg Kinnamon said after the Ridley lawsuit officials changed county policy so workers who felt like they could n't go to their supervisors with complaints could go to the county attorney
County financial officer Tommy Parker said officials did n't summon employees to a meeting to talk with employees about the policy change and they could n't remember how it was communicated to the staff .
Last week , former Magistrate Court employees Virginia Rector , Yesenia Galvan and Sonya Petty filed a similar lawsuit against Cochran and the county .
All worked for Cochran , and all allege they were sexually harassed and then intimidated to keep quiet . At the office , Rector alleged Cochran would close the door to the bathroom and rub their breasts and genital area .
They also allege the county neglected to protect them .
But Benton Mathis , who represents the county in that case , said the suit is retaliation after the women were told to resign .
`` We intend to defend this case [ in ] that the women had ample opportunity to complain and they did n't do so , '' they said .

Saving for retirement is a major undertaking for most of us . Increasing healthcare costs and longer life expectancies make the hill a bit steeper to climb each year . Health savings accounts ( HSA ) provide another vehicle to save for retirement .
Many of you have the option to enroll in high-deductible insurance plans that allow the use of a health savings account via your employer . An HSA can serve as an additional retirement savings vehicle on top of your IRA or 401 ( k ) to help cover healthcare and other retirement expenses . With the annual open enrollment period commencing for many companies , this is a good time to consider a high-deductible plan with an HSA if this option is offered .
The rising cost of healthcare in retirement
According to Fidelity an average couple both aged 65 will spend on average $ 280,000 on medical costs in retirement . This is up from $ 275,000 in 2017 , $ 260,000 in 2016 , $ 245,000 in 2015 , $ 220,000 in 2014 and from $ 190,000 from their 2005 survey .
This is a significant amount even for retirees with a retirement nest egg in excess of $ 1 million .
High deductible health insurance plans
Health insurance plans with an annual deductible of at least $ 1,350 for a single person and $ 2,700 for a family qualify for use with HSAs in 2018 , with no change in these limits for 2019 . These types of plan are becoming more common with employers and are available privately as well . Premiums are generally less expensive than plans with lower deductibles .
How the HSA works
HSA accounts can only be used in conjunction with a high-deductible health insurance plan . The HSA will be a separate medical savings account into which the employee or private policyholder can contribute money during the year . The money goes into the account on a pre-tax basis much like a traditional 401 ( k ) or IRA . Additionally , this is a great opportunity for those who earn too much to make pre-tax contributions to a traditional IRA , or who have made the maximum contributions to their 401 ( k ) to reduce their taxable income a bit .
The contribution limits for 2018 are $ 3,450 for individuals and $ 6,850 for families . Those who will be 55 or older at any point during the year are eligible to contribute an extra $ 1,000 . For 2019 , the limits increase slightly to $ 3,500 for individuals and $ 7,000 for families , with the extra $ 1,000 for those 55 and older still available . Some employers may also make contributions to employee 's accounts .
Money can be withdrawn tax-free from the HSA account to pay for a variety of qualified medical expenses . Withdrawals used to pay for non-qualified medical costs will be included in your gross income and included in your taxable income . Withdrawals for non-qualified expenses may also be subject to a penalty .
The real advantage is that money not used to cover eligible expenses can also be left in the account from year-to-year . This differs from a Flexible Spending Account ( FSA ) where all money must be used by the end of the year in conjunction with qualified medical expenses . Any unused dollars are lost to you .
The money in the HSA is portable when you leave an employer . Many banks and investment custodians offer HSA accounts , some with investment options that are similar to an IRA account . The investments chosen should reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon for the money just like any other investment account . Just like an IRA account you should shop around for the HSA account that best meets your needs including investment options and fees .
Qualified medical expenses
Examples of qualified medical expenses include :
Health insurance coinsurance and deductibles
Most medical and dental expenses
Vision care
Prescription drugs and insulin
Medicare premiums
A portion of the premiums for a tax-qualified long-term care policy
These are just some examples of the types of qualified medical and related expenses for which funds in an HSA account can be used on a tax-free basis .
Health Savings Accounts and retirement
For those who can afford to cover some or all of their out-of-pocket medical costs from other sources while they are working , HSA contributions can serve as an excellent supplement to their other retirement savings in IRAs , 401 ( k ) s and elsewhere .
Money in the HSA can be saved until retirement to cover qualified medical costs . This can make your retirement savings go farther . Remember the money comes out tax-free for qualified medical expenses . In addition , your contributions are made on a pre-tax basis ( note some plans allow for after-tax contributions as well ) .
Beyond medical expenses , once you reach age 65 the money can withdraw penalty-free for purposes other than paying for qualified medical expenses , though the withdrawals will be taxed at ordinary income rates like a tradition IRA account .
HSAs are not subject to required minimum distributions at age 70 ½ , allowing the HSA to continue to grow tax-free . If a spouse is named as the beneficiary of the account , they or they can inherit the money tax-free . Non-spousal beneficiaries will be taxed on the account 's fair market value .
The Bottom Line
With the cost of healthcare in retirement continuing to increase , the health savings account is increasingly being viewed as an additional retirement account . If you have access to one , consider funding an HSA account to help supplement your other retirement savings efforts .

In a series of tweets on Friday after the news broke that President Donald Trump 's chief strategist Steve Bannon had stepped down , author and conservative pundit Ann Coulter praised Bannon and offered some advice to the president .
“ If @ realDonaldTrump did n't like the media giving Steve Bannon all credit , instead of firing him , they should 've hired 10 more like him , ” Coulter tweeted .
Coulter also said Trump should get going on their campaign promises so the president can also get some credit .
“ To prove that they did n't get all the good stuff from Bannon , @ realDonaldTrump better start the wall pronto ! ” Coulter tweeted .
They also poked fun at the Wall Street presence inside the White House and the power the media seems to have inside the Beltway .
“ Here 's a great sign : Wall Street traders ARE CHEERING the departure of Bannon , ” Coulter tweeted .
“ STEVE BANNON OUT ! Media is the most powerful branch of government , ” Coulter tweeted .
“ Who will media decide @ realDonaldTrump has to fire next ? ” Coulter tweeted .
Coulter also retweeted Washington Post 's political reporter Dave Weigel 's tweet : “ The irony : Bannon had the popular ideas ! Infrastructure ! Taxing globalists ! Trump is left w whatever Charles Koch scrawled on a napkin . ”

NASA and Boeing have awarded Aerojet Rocketdyne widely-anticipated contracts to restart the production of simplified shuttle-era rocket engines for the heavy-lift Space Launch System and supply the propulsion system for the CST-100 Starliner commercial crew capsule , officials announced this week .
The deals are welcome news for Aerojet Rocketdyne , which in the last year has lost an engine contract for Orbital ATK 's Antares rocket and is running second in a race with Jeff Bezos ' Blue Origin to supply engines for United Launch Alliance 's next-generation Vulcan rocket .
The Space Launch System contract announced Monday , valued at $ 1.16 billion , begins the process to resume production of RS-25 engines after the assembly line was shut down nearly a decade ago in the final years of the space shuttle program .
“ The first phase of this contract covers the scope of work related to restarting the production lines for RS-25 plus the materials of future production efforts , ” said Cheryl Warner , a NASA spokesperson . “ The second phase , which will include a contract modification at a later date , is related to the labor required for the delivery of six new flight engines . ”
The future modification would enable the space agency to order six engines , enough for one SLS flight with two spares . A seventh engine is included in the deal for use in ground certification testing , Glenn Mahone , an Aerojet Rocketdyne spokesperson , told Spaceflight Now .
Two other engines will be retrofitted for ground tests , Warner said .
The engines will be built at Aerojet Rocketdyne 's DeSoto plant in Chatsworth , California , with final assembly and testing at NASA 's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi .
NASA 's current inventory includes 16 RS-25 engines left over from the space shuttle program , enough for four SLS missions . The construction of six new engines enables a fifth SLS flight in the 2020s .
“ SLS is America 's next generation heavy-lift system , ” said Julie Van Kleeck , vice president of advanced space and launch programs at Aerojet Rocketdyne , in a press release . “ This is the rocket that will enable humans to leave low Earth orbit and travel deeper into the solar system , eventually taking humans to Mars . ”
NASA previously said it was negotiating with Aerojet Rocketdyne for the sole-source RS-25 production contract .
A statement released by Aerojet Rocketdyne said the contract runs from November 2015 through Sept. 30 , 2024 .
Each Space Launch System flight will be powered by four RS-25 engines at the bottom of the rocket 's core stage , plus two solid rocket boosters , enlarged variants of the solid-fueled motors from the space shuttle program .
The first test flight of the Space Launch System is scheduled for 2018 — along with an unpiloted Orion crew spacecraft — flying in its 70-metric ton ( 77-ton ) configuration with a second stage derived from United Launch Alliance 's Delta 4 rocket . A bigger upper stage , needed to carry cargo such as habitats into deep space , will debut on a later SLS flight , possibly as soon as the launcher 's second flight with a crewed Orion on-board some time between 2021 and 2023 .
Originally designed in the 1970s , the RS-25 engine burns a mixture of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants and generates up to 512,300 pounds of thrust in vacuum . In 405 engine flights through the life of the shuttle program , only one engine failed , with little impact to the mission .
In an interview with Spaceflight Now in August , Van Kleeck said Aerojet Rocketdyne targeted a 30 percent reduction in the price of an RS-25 engine in the new production contract , largely due to 3D printing , or additive manufacturing , technology .
The engines will also be simplified because they will not be reusable like the space shuttle 's engines . Because the engines will be discarded after each SLS flight , engineers plan to run them at higher thrust levels .
The engines on the first SLS test flight in 2018 will run at 109 percent of rated thrust , up from the 104 percent setting normally used on shuttle launches . Officials plan to eventually certify the engine for a 111 percent thrust level .
“ On shuttle , we would light the engines , they would take off , they 'd fly for eight-and-a-half minutes and they 'd come back with the orbiters , ” said Timothy Duquette , an SLS engines engineer at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama . “ For SLS , it 's not coming back . So these are now expendable engines . One of the things that allows us to do is we actually run them at slightly higher thrust than we used to , a higher power level . It 's a little harder on the engine , we 're running it a little closer to redline , but it 's safe , especially for short durations on a mission like SLS . ”
Van Kleeck said Aerojet Rocketdyne will consolidate its engine production at the company 's DeSoto plant in Chatsworth , California , after shutting down a facility in nearby Canoga Park , further streamlining the factory processing .
The engine design will also get a review to identify obsolete components .
“ Obsolescence is an issue we deal with in rockets all the time because you deal with low volumes , and so we 've got pretty good processes for monitoring that , as well as trying to do risk management for that purpose , ” Van Kleeck told Spaceflight Now in August , when NASA and Aerojet Rocketdyne were in negotiations for the new RS-25 contract .
Engineers are already testing a modernized computer controller — developed by Aerojet Rocketdyne and Honeywell — for the engine . It will be introduced on the first SLS flight .
“ For example , the controller was essentially obsolete , ” Van Kleeck said . “ We built a new controller — a brand-new design — because electronics and computers have really evolved quite a lot in the last few decades .
“ We 'll go through the entire engine , and part of restarting the build is to make sure that we 've dealt with any obsolescence if we have any , ” Van Kleeck said . “ If the last supplier went out of business , what do we do about that ? ”
They said the new flight-ready RS-25 engines are targeted for delivery to NASA in 2022 or 2023 .
The engine cost-cutting initiative is vital to NASA 's goal of flying the Space Launch System once per year after the first crewed mission in the early 2020s , an objective that Bill Hill , head of the agency 's exploration systems programs , said in August requires the rocket to cost less than a billion dollars per flight .
Managing the launch costs will also help NASA afford habitation modules and other advanced systems needed for long-duration human expeditions into deep space , all aimed at paving the way for astronaut trips to the vicinity of Mars , a mission NASA says is possible in the 2030s .
“ Not only will ( $ 1 billion launch costs ) get us to one per year , but if we have a flat-line $ 3 billion budget and it costs me a billion dollars for SLS , and say half a billion dollars for Orion … then I 've got some headroom to go do other things like buy a habitat and other things that we 're going to need to operate in space for the long-term . ”
So how is the SLS team doing on cost ?
“ We 're a good way away , ” Hill told Spaceflight Now in August . “ I got my first report in our budget cycle this year , and it was a lot higher than I expected . Orion was a little bit better , so I think we 've got work to do … We 've got to get our cost of our engines down and that 's part of this , and part of what Aerojet Rocketdyne is doing with their new plant in DeSoto , just to get it to a point where we can afford to fly this thing on a yearly basis . ”
The unit cost for each new RS-25 engine under the contract announced this week has not been disclosed , but Hill said NASA hopes to reduce its cost to $ 50 million or $ 60 million per engine .
“ That still is a lot of money when you consider you 're using four of those per mission , ” Hill said . “ We 're looking at affordability initiatives with Aerojet Rocketdyne . It 's trying to get them to take a look at their processes , how they actually build the engine , can you use selective laser melting on certain parts ? The whole selective laser melting will revolutionize manufacturing , especially in our industry , and if we can get those things down where you can machine a critical part — a complex part — where it might have taken you six-to-eight months , and you can do it in maybe two or three , that 's very helpful . ”
Despite the cost and complexity , NASA officials said the existing stockpile of RS-25 engines , along with its high performance , made the shuttle-era propulsion system an obvious choice for the Space Launch System .
“ It 's the best technical solution , by far , for SLS propulsion , ” said Steve Wofford , manager of the SLS liquid engines office at Marshall . “ It 's also the most affordable solution for this vehicle .
“ In addition to those 16 engines ( in inventory ) , it 's also a stable design , so the cost and time associated with going through the design , fail , fix cycles to develop a new engine are enormous , ” Wofford said .
Company also gets nod for CST-100 propulsion system
Aerojet Rocketdyne , an aerospace propulsion contractor based in Sacramento , California , also announced this week it secured an expected contract from Boeing to provide thrusters , fuel tanks and abort engines for the CST-100 Starliner commercial crew capsule .
The CST-100 contract is worth nearly $ 200 million , Aerojet Rocketdyne said in a statement , and it covers seven “ shipsets , ” or complete propulsion kits , for the crew capsule 's service module .
Each shipset includes four 40,000-pound thrust launch abort engines for the CST-100 's pusher escape system and 24 orbital maneuvering and attitude control thrusters , each generating 1,500 pounds of thrust for low-altitude abort attitude control and in-space orbit adjustments .
Each propulsion kit also has 28 reaction control system engines for high-altitude abort attitude control , smaller burns in orbit , and space station re-boost capability . The shipsets also include 164 valves , 12 tanks and more than 500 feet of ducts , lines and tubing for the service module propulsion system , Aerojet Rocketdyne said .
Boeing plans to reuse the CST-100 crew module , but the service module will be jettisoned to burn up in Earth 's atmosphere on re-entry . Smaller Aerojet Rocketdyne thrusters will guide the crew capsule through the atmosphere before parachutes and airbags deploy for touchdown on land .
The crew and service modules are constructed by Boeing engineers at the Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility , a refurbished space shuttle hangar , at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
The first CST-100 test flights , first without a crew and then with astronauts , are scheduled for 2017 . A standard operational crew rotation mission to the International Space Station will carry four astronauts and a limited amount of cargo .
NASA selected Boeing and SpaceX last year to complete development of new commercially-owned spaceships to end U.S. reliance on Russia 's Soyuz spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the space station .
“ Aerojet Rocketdyne is leveraging adaptations of proven hardware and technologies to deliver an affordable reliable propulsion system that can be counted on to perform throughout the spacecraft 's mission and ensure the safety of the astronauts and success of the mission , ” said Terry Lorier , Aerojet Rocketdyne 's CST-100 service module propulsion system program manager . “ We are honored to play a critical role in continuing our nation 's legacy in human-rated spaceflight , as well as helping to revolutionize how our great country accesses and explores space . ”

Jeremy Corbyn today savages Amazon for not doing enough to protect drivers , calling for new safety laws and better pay .
The Labour leader says Amazon can not wash its hands of their treatment just because they do not work for it directly .
They tell bosses : “ You ca n't say it 's nothing to do with you . It 's everything to do with you .
“ You 're a big company and you 're employing subcontractors to deliver for you and you are morally if not legally responsible for those conditions and the pressure on those people . ”

Mr Corbyn slams targets of up to 200 deliveries a day as “ excessive ” and warns that 14-hour shifts are dangerous .
They also point out that drivers come under extra stress when people are not home and they can not make deliveries .
Congratulating the Sunday Mirror 's investigations , they add : “ Exposing it is an important first step . But it 's also about minimum wages and conditions – that 's why zero hours contracts should go . ”

'Bosses back to Victorian days '
By REBECCA LONG-BAILEY , Shadow Secretary of State for Business , Energy and Industrial Strategy
Victorian England was dominated by a factory system notorious for its appalling conditions .
People worked long , arduous hours , often involving repetitive and demanding tasks , for meagre pay .
They had virtually no protection from unscrupulous owners who made huge profits out of them .
A lot changed with the advent of the Labour Party , which led the charge to improve workers ' conditions , rights and wages . But in 21st-century Tory Britain we see the re-emergence of Victorian-like conditions , not only in the gig economy but elsewhere .
This is why Labour has a 20-point plan which includes giving all workers equal rights from day one and raising the minimum wage to £10 an hour .

O'Malley , Warner , McDonnell and Jindal have all been schmoozing potential funders . 2016 contenders court mega-donors
A week after Election Day , three Republican governors mentioned as 2016 presidential candidates — Bobby Jindal , John Kasich and Bob McDonnell — each stopped by the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino to meet privately with its owner Sheldon Adelson , a man who could single-handedly underwrite their White House ambitions .
Planning a presidential campaign used to mean having coffee with county party chairs in their Iowa or New Hampshire living rooms . The courting of Adelson , a full four years out from 2016 , demonstrates how super PAC sugar daddies have become the new must-have feature for White House wannabes .
Story Continued Below
( Also on POLITICO : Megadonors seek low profiles )
And prospective candidates from both parties are wasting little time schmoozing potential super PAC funders .
Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley is meeting with big donors in Los Angeles this week and has a fundraiser scheduled for next Monday in the Washington suburbs . Vice President Joe Biden , Republican Texas Gov . Rick Perry and Sen. Mark Warner ( D-Va. ) have been meeting with big donors , leaving the impression that they 're ready to run .
“ A group of five people could contribute $ 10 million each and finance a substantial primary campaign for a candidate , ” said former South Carolina Gov . Jim Hodges . “ So there is probably more of an effort right now focused on trying to look at those people who are capable of being very large donors , rather than soliciting or developing the network of bundlers that were out there in the past . ”
( PHOTOS : Republicans , 2016 : In full swing )
Hodges , a Democrat , is co-hosting the fundraiser for O'Malley 's leadership PAC in Chevy Chase , Md. , on Monday . They also raised money earlier this year for the PAC fronted by Massachusetts Gov . Deval Patrick , and said he 'd probably help other Democrats “ who want to get out there and test the waters ” by meeting with donors . “ It 's an important part of a process . ”
And it 's becoming more important , as demonstrated by the 2012 Republican primaries — the first since federal court decisions allowed super PACs to accept unlimited cash — which proved that a single super-rich supporter can essentially float an entire campaign . While the GOP establishment desperately tried to rally around eventual nominee Mitt Romney , super PACs funded by Adelson , Foster Friess and Jon Huntsman Sr. extended the challenges of Newt Gingrich , Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman Jr. respectively , before a pro-Romney super PAC obliterated the field .
And in 2016 — with open primaries in both parties and the power of super PACs firmly established — the biggest donors are being courted earlier than ever . Not only are entreaties coming before most of the donors are anywhere close to choosing sides , none of the suitors are willing to discuss their plans publicly .
( See also : Dem super PACs jump on 2014 , 2016 )
Santorum is privately telling friends that he 's running again , POLITICO has learned . Friess , a retired mutual fund guru who donated $ 2.2 million to a pair of super PACs credited with helping lift Santorum to a surprise win over Romney in the Iowa caucuses , said , “ Right now , I 'm certainly still in their camp , but four years is a long way away . ”
Adelson — a Las Vegas casino billionaire whose family donated a record $ 84 million or more to GOP outside groups , including $ 20 million each to the super PACs devoted to Romney and Gingrich — has signaled that they are undeterred from their weak 2012 return on investment and plans to continue giving big .
'The Emperor Has No Balls ' ( Photo by Annie Lesser/LAist )
Do n't say the headline did n't warn you . But a statue depicting Donald Trump in their birthday suit has appeared in Los Feliz—and we do n't think The Donald would appreciate its depiction of his , um , attributes .
The statue is the work of an anarchist art collective known as INDECLINE , according to the Washington Post . Earlier this year , the same group covered the Hollywood Walk of Fame with the names of victims of police brutality .
The statue itself is credited to an artist who simply calls themselves Ginger and is titled `` The Emperor Has No Balls . '' Much like artist Illma Gore 's painting , it 's not very generous towards Trump and the size of their manhood . Here 's a video of Ginger in action , putting together the work :
As you can see in the video , there are multiple statues , and they have been spotted in New York , San Francisco , Cleveland and Seattle .
Due to the clandestine nature of the work , we expect it to be not long for this earth ( like Trump 's chances in this election—hey-o ! ) , so check it out while you can as it stands in front of Soap Plant & WACKO at 4633 Hollywood Blvd. , if you want .

Conspiracy Theory : It 's a term used by many to brush off something that clashes with what they believe in , or have believed in for a long period of time . Taking in new information that runs counter to a current belief system is not easy and can cause the feeling of cognitive dissonance – a term used in modern psychology to describe the feeling of discomfort that arises from being confronted with two or more conflicting ideas , beliefs , or values . It suggests that we have an inner drive to hold on to all of our beliefs and attitudes , avoiding the feelings of discomfort and instability that accompany new ideas , regardless of whether those ideas are backed by evidence and sound logic .
Why do we always believe , without consideration , what is presented to us through mainstream sources ? Why do we hold it to be true , without question ? Why is it so common for many of us to not even acknowledge , listen , or look at evidence which runs counter to the accepted ideology ? To ignore available information which presents an alternative to what is so commonly believed by many – or what we ourselves believe can place the human race in a very vulnerable , gullible state ? Even if there is an overwhelming amount of evidence , many find it easy to dismiss .
Below is a list of events and phenomena which are or have been considered “ conspiracy theories ” by the general population , all of which can be backed up by an impressive amount of research and testimonies from experts in their respective fields .
It 's unfortunate that our world has been riddled with lies , misinformation , and fraud . It 's no secret that if you tell a lie long enough , it becomes the truth .
“ Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance. ” – Albert Einstein
These are in no particular order , as they are all significant in their own right .
The Black Budget
Prior to Edward Snowden ( the former NSA employee who leaked classified information ) , if you told somebody you thought there existed what seems to be a separate civilization – a part of humanity that broke off in secret , and is thousands , if not millions , of years more advanced than the mainstream academic/scientific/technical world – there is absolutely no doubt you would have been brushed off as a crazy conspiracy theorist .
But when Snowden leaked the very first documentation proving the existence of clandestine black budget operations , that all changed . Despite these recent leaks , many are still unaware of the black budget world , and the fact that it had been investigated and talked about before these leaks .
We have an article that goes in-depth and is well sourced regarding this topic . You can read that article HERE .
“ In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military industrial complex . The potential for a disastrous rise of misplaced power exists , and will persist . Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry , can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defence , with our peaceful message and goals. ” – Dwight Eisenhower , Former Five-Star General and President of the United States ( source )
9/11
The tragedy that unfolded on September 11th , 2001 was horrific . To this day and despite the fact that many of the victims ' families themselves question the events of that day , many still consider anyone suspicious of 9/11 to be a conspiracy theorist . It 's important to mention that the mainstream media has played a large part in pushing this idea , that anybody who questions what happened on that day is “ nuts . ”
According to the latest polls , more than 150 million people ( in America alone ) do not believe the official explanation given to them by their government when it comes to 9/11 , and the same amount actually suspect a controlled demolition of World Trade Centre building 7 . Think about that for a moment . ( A simple Google search will show you a number of polls that have taken place over the years . )
A quick Google search of polls regarding 9/11 will paint a clear picture for you . People are not stupid , so why is it that so many people believe it was a staged event ? It 's because of all of the evidence that has surfaced over the years .
There is a tremendous amount of evidence to support all of these claims , and others , like the fact that the supposed “ Al-Qaeda ” terrorist group was in fact a creation of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) . And yet , many people have a hard time hearing about , let alone thinking about these realities .
We 've written about this topic in detail , and you can check out some of these articles for more information to see why the questioning of 9/11 is far from a conspiracy theory , by clicking HERE .
Unidentified Flying Objects ( UFOs )
This is a very big one , and as with 9/11 , in the United States alone , at least half of all Americans say that we 're not alone in the universe . Fifty percent of Americans already believe that there is some form of life on other planets , while only seventeen percent think that there is not . A quarter of Americans believe that intelligent extraterrestrial visitors have already come to Earth and have been doing so for a long time . ( Source in article linked below . )
Why do people believe this ? The answer is simple . As former Princeton professor and NASA astronaut Dr. Brian O'Leary remarked , “ there is abundant evidence ” ( source ) clearly indicating that there is something going on in our atmosphere and around our planet which , as Mike Gold puts it ( Director of Operations For Bigelow Aerospace ) , deserves serious attention . ( source )
The evidence comes in the form of statements made by high-ranking military personnel , political personnel , academicians , and more . It also comes in the form of official documents released by dozens of countries officially acknowledging and disclosing the existence of UFOs . That 's not all , in fact , this subject is littered with so much information that it can be overwhelming for one to think about .
We 've written about this topic in-depth , and to view some of this evidence you can click HERE .

Geo-Engineering and Solar Radiation Management Via Stratospheric Spraying
Also known as “ chemtrails , ” the idea of injecting stratospheric particles into the atmosphere to combat the effects of climate change is very real , and not new .
Dr. Matthew Watson , PhD , a researcher in the department of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol , is one of many scientists who are warning against this practice .
“ If we ever deploy these technologies it will be the closest indication yet that we 've failed as planetary flight attendants . While it is clear that temperatures could be reduced during deployment , the misstep is considerable . Personally , this stuff terrifies me. ” – Dr. Watson ( You can read more about that HERE )
This idea is far from a conspiracy theory ,
Some of the candidate particles to spray in the air are :
Sulphate/Sulphuric Acid/Sulphur Dioxide
Titanium dioxide
Silicon Carbide
Calcium Carbonate
Alumina
Silica
Zinc Oxide
But are these programs operational ? Well , the weather was modified using these techniques for the Olympic games in China , and if you are an observer of skies and a researcher of geo-engineering , you 'll know that there is a sufficient amount of evidence to suggest that spraying is already occurring .
“ In recent years there has been a decline in the support for weather modification research , and a tendency to move directly into operational projects. ” – World Meteorological Association ( source )
Again , this is far from a conspiracy theory , and with all of the information available in the public domain it 's clear that this topic is something that deserves our utmost attention . That being said , as with the other topics , there is still a harsh resistance by the mainstream , who often ridicule this topic , despite all of the information that is out there .

A Small Group Of Elite People And The Corporations They Run Own Everything
Not that long ago , if you were to tell anyone that a small group of people and the corporations they run are in control of all the world 's resources , you would have received some decidedly ‘ weird ' looks . Fortunately , thanks to recent global protests like the Occupy Wall Street Movement , more people have become aware of what is known as the “ one percent. ” That percentage represents the people who have access to the most wealth on the planet .
The same group of élite are in control of our health , finances , education , food , politics , media , and financial industries , and they contribute to the military industrial complex . It 's clear that there are many problems within these industries that affect us on a daily basis .
This was also demonstrated by three systems theorists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich . They published a study titled “ The Network Of Global Corporate Control ” about a relatively small group of companies , mainly banks , with disproportionate power over the global economy . ( source )
Here is a great clip that relates to this topic by Foster Gamble , taken from the Thrive documentary .
Water Fluoridation
There is a reason why so many countries and communities around the world have recently stopped the practice of putting fluoride into their drinking water .
We are not talking about naturally occurring fluoride that is already found in water , we are talking about hydrofluorosilicic acid , a toxic industrial waste by-product that governments have been adding to our drinking water for over sixty years .
“ If this stuff gets out into the air , it 's a pollutant ; if it gets into the river , it 's a pollutant ; if it gets into the lake , it 's a pollutant ; but if it goes right straight into your drinking water system , it 's not a pollutant . That 's amazing. ” ( source ) – Former VP and Senior Chemist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Headquarters
In fact , one of the most credible medical journals in the world recently classified it as a neurotoxin . You can read more about that here .
“ In point of fact , fluoride causes more human cancer deaths than any other chemical . When you have power you do n't have to tell the truth . That 's a rule that 's been working in this world for generations . There are a great many people who do n't tell the truth when they are in power in administrative positions . Fluoride amounts to public murder on a grand scale . It is some of the most conclusive scientific and biological evidence that I have come across in my 50 years in the field of cancer research. ” ( source ) – Dr. Dean Burk , biochemist , Founder of Biotin , and Former Chief Chemist at the National Cancer Institute of Health
We have written about this topic in depth , you can read more in depth articles regarding water fluoridation HERE .
Here is a documentary we made about the subject :
Over-Unity Energy
Despite many people opposing this idea , constantly citing the law of conservation of energy , multiple papers have been published in various peer reviewed journals showing that yes , extracting energy from the vacuum is possible . You can find these in the articles linked below .
“ The concept that efficiencies can not be greater than 100 % is due to an incomplete understanding of the properties of space . The second law of thermodynamics must be modified to account for the fact that space is not empty , as has been taught for the last 150 years. ” – Toby Grotz , engineer and researcher of new energy technologies since 1973
Collective Evolution has been lucky enough to have been covering a story , and working with Toby Grotz and Paramahamsa Tewari , to help create more awareness about this . Tewari has invented an over-unity machine . We have assisted them in building the website and we are extrememly honored to help spread the word : tewari.org
We encourage all those who are reading this to check it out .
Do you really think that these brilliant scientists and engineers would devote their entire lives to something that did not show potential , or something that is not real ? This concept is , again , still faced with fierce resistance , but this will all change , and for the sake of the planet it has to , so stay tuned !
You can view pictures of the machine at the link to the site above . It wo n't be long until we are showing you a video of it ourselves .

Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMOs )
Few things exemplify more absolutely the fact that we are living in a world of deception , manipulation , and fraudulent science than GMOs . Over the past few years , a number of studies ( both independent and peer-reviewed ) have emerged which clearly outline why GMOs should not be approved as completely safe for human consumption . Despite this fact , their status has not changed .
The truth of their danger was also demonstrated by the March Against Monsanto , a worldwide protest where millions of people around the world gather every year to peacefully protest the biotech giants .
There is a reason why so many countries around the world have now completely banned GMOs and the pesticides that go with them .
“ As part of the process , they portrayed the various concerns as merely the ignorant opinions of misinformed individuals – and derided them as not only unscientific , but anti-science . They then set to work to convince the public and government officials , through the dissemination of false information , that there was an overwhelming expert consensus , based on solid evidence , that GMOs were safe. ” – Jane Goodall

HOUSTON - A woman is accused of sexually assaulting children with their boyfriend , and photographing the children for exploitation , according to the Harris County Sheriff 's Office .
Ashley Virginia Dack , 29 , was charged with sexual performance by a child and super aggravated sexual assault of a child . Them boyfriend , Patrick Schuneman , was also charged .
Court documents show that Dack and Schuneman were performing sex acts against innocent children , some as young as 11 months old , and would boast of their activities in sexually-explicit text messages to one another . Dack was a babysitter , giving their access to several victims .
`` The defendants befriend women who have small children to gain access to the children , '' Tiffany Dupree , the chief prosecutor said .
Dack allegedly bragged about their exploits to a friend . The friend backed up text messages from Dack 's phone after they asked them to charge it for her , then they contacted authorities on Oct. 14 , 2014 , and turned over the evidence , according to court documents .
Officers executed search warrants at Dack 's and Schuneman 's residences simultaneously . One item seized was an iPhone 4 and disturbingly graphic text messages were found .
A text message exchange between Dack and Schuneman on Aug. 30 , 2012 , read in part :
Dack : There is a little girl at lunch ... Wanted you 2 to be hiding in my car and I could bring them 2 you .
According to court documents , Dack sent Schuneman multiple images of children engaging in sexual activity . One of the images showed Dack inappropriately touching an 11-month-old .
`` The defendant and co-defendant shared text messages over time that suggest something more sadistic than your typical sexual abuse , '' Prosecutor Stephen Driver said .
Investigators tracked down the mother of the toddler and discovered that Dack babysat the child on May 10 , 2013 , the same day the pictures and text messages were sent .
Investigators said after reviewing the text messages , it was apparent the couple were conspiring and planning together to sexually abuse children and to photograph and video their exploits for their sexual gratification .
They moved forward with filing charges to get the couple off the streets and save other children from harm .
Dack 's charges were filed Friday and their bond was raised Monday to $ 350,000 .
Prosecutors believe Dack is a flight risk and a judge stipulated Monday that if they posted bail they would be required to surrender their passport and wear an ankle monitor .

THE OSLO SYNDROME is the name used by Jewish writer Kenneth Levin to specifically describe the psychology of Jews who hate Jews , but the concept applies to all groups as it is a basic human psychological phenomenon which is related both to the Stockholm syndrome and the Battered Child syndrome .
Essentially , what happens is that when a specific group of people is subjected to constant hatred , demonization , and abuse , some in the group will often have their spirits broken and be beaten down like whipped dogs , and they 'll lose self-esteem and group-esteem , and feel worthlessness and be full of despair .
These despairing individuals , with the Oslo syndrome , wo n't blame those who are harming them , but will actually take the side of those harming them against others in their own group . Levin posits the notion that some Jews living among Palestinians and identifying with and taking the side of the Palestinians against their fellow Jews exhibit the Oslo syndrome . Now , given the poor way Israel treats the Palestinians one can certainly question Levin 's analysis that Jews hating Jews in this regard have the Oslo syndrome . Instead , the case can be made that such Jews simply understand right from wrong as these terms are used in a universal sense . Nevertheless , Levin 's larger and perhaps inadvertent point remains by extension that any adult individuals and groups of adult individuals — and not just Jews and Jewish groups — can have the same psychological symptoms often seen in children who are abused , or as Levin calls it , the Oslo syndrome ..
Native Americans
We saw a similar phenomenon among American Indians , many of whom came to feel so worthless that they preferred to commit suicide rather than live as the worthless individuals they felt they were . In these cases , the psychological feelings of guilt , self-hate , and worthlessness were so great that to relieve these feelings — this very real , but unseen psychological pain — these individuals just ended their own lives . Others turned to alcohol . Still others just suffered silently and simply stopped trying to live full lives . In most cases Indians blamed themselves and other Indians for their problems .
Suicide to relieve the psychological pain and feelings of guilt and worthlessness
It is worth emphasizing that at the root of the Oslo syndrome are feelings of self-hate , worthlessness , and guilt and that some individuals will strike out against their own people to relieve these negative feelings , and their pressure release valve is this ritual suicide or self-abnegation . Others will take a more direct route and simply end their lives . Those who relieve their feelings of worthlessness and guilt by striking out at their own people and by embracing the bias against their people will often feel “ virtuous ” in doing so .
It is well said that those who commit suicide do n't want to end their lives , they just want to end their psychological pain . Suicide is one way . Erasing oneself with drugs or alcohol is another . Siding with the group that is attacking your group is still another way . And there are others . The underlying psychological principle here is one of trying to release the pent-up psychological pressure of these feelings of despair , self-hate , guilt and worthlessness .
Battered Child syndrome
The link to Battered Child syndrome is clear and throws light on the adult manifestation of such a syndrome . A child who is battered , either physically or psychologically , will often not see that the problem is not with themselves or themselves but with the parent or parent figure who has full control over the child and who is the abuser . The child internalizes the abuse , feels guilty , and blames themselves or themselves and believes that if only they or they acted better or was a better child , the parent or parent figure would stop abusing the child . In other words , the child believes they or they are always at fault and is worthless .
White self-haters
Whites who apologize for being White or who forgive non-White attackers often have the Oslo syndrome .
You 've no doubt seen the stories of Whites forgiving Blacks who tried to kill them because they 're White and how these beaten-down Whites will often accept the Black bias against Whites . You 've probably also read about White parents who forgive Blacks who kill the White children of the White parents — and these White parents then say they “ understand ” and sometimes even befriend the killers of their own White children . Such behaviors on the part of Whites are indicative of the Oslo syndrome .
Today , we see Whites attacked on many different levels in our society . There is a constant society-wide drumbeat demonizing Whites . We constantly hear , for example , that Whites have n't earned what they have and that they only got it because of “ White privilege ” — or that except for White racism and hatred of Blacks , Blacks would be leading better lives . This is nothing less than psychological abuse of Whites similar to what we see in cases of child abuse . Whites are made to feel guilty for doing nothing more than being who and what they are by birth , yet any expressions of Whiteness or of their genetic identity or of feeling good about oneself are quickly denigrated as being signs of “ racism ” and White evil .
As with all psychological maladies , there is a continuum of self-hate and some of the symptoms and expressions of the Oslo syndrome in Whites are more subtle and may appear to the casual viewer as being virtuous . For example , when you see Whites who are hypersensitive to perceived insults to Blacks and who then attack their fellow Whites verbally or physically for their “ racism , ” you can be pretty sure you are seeing a person with the Oslo syndrome . The lives of such self-hating Whites are ones of self-abnegation .
And we see cases of some Whites not so much fearing that others will call them racist , but fearing that they may be secretly racist and as such they have let themselves down and that they must punish themselves . In fact , we can safely speculate that a lot of White suicides are from this feeling in some Whites that they have let themselves down or have n't lived up to some societal , religious , or family standards regarding various norms including the societal demand that one not be a racist . So , instead of being racist , they obliterate themselves — or they live on and hate themselves , and relieve the pressure by transferring the hate to other Whites thereby proving to themselves that they are “ good ” people for attacking other Whites .
We 'll also see Whites trying to erase themselves and their kind by not having children , or by holding down the number of children they have , or by miscegenating and producing non-White children , or by adopting non-White children instead of White children . Hermann Goering 's great-niece says they had their tubes tied so they “ would not pass on the blood of a monster . ”
There are many ways this self-hate syndrome and similar self-hate neuroses can manifest themselves , but the goal for the individual is always to relieve that psychological pain of guilt for being White , and then to “ make amends ” for the “ evil ” — that you think you are born with because you are White — by somehow sacrificing yourself . Of course you can add in the Great White Mother and Great White Father complexes that I 've written before as part of the subconscious motivations for adopting non-White children — and , usually , the Blacker the better . These folks would n't want to adopt a Black baby that is n't almost purple Black lest others not realize that the baby really is Black and that the adoptive White parents are truly “ virtuous ” and “ righteous ” individuals .
Staying mentally healthy and emotionally strong
So , what is a mentally healthy view of oneself ? It is that you should be who you are born to be . Do n't ever apologize for being White . Do n't ever support non-Whites against Whites . Always remember that you have every right to be who and what you are . You have every right to identify as White and to feel good about yourself .
No one has a right to abuse you or insult you or attack you because you are White and if they do , you should not go hide in a corner but stand up for yourself in whatever way is appropriate , and which does n't put you in harm 's way . If remaining silent under the circumstances is the best choice for your survival and safety , then that 's what you should do . But , as you do so , never let the haters of Whites make you feel guilty and worthless for being White . You are exactly the opposite of that , just by being born White . You are an important person to yourself , your family , your ancestors and to all the rest of us Whites who are awake and aware . You are not alone . You are never alone . You are not the only one who feels as you do . There are millions of us .
Never let the haters of Whites make you feel isolated and out of sync with what is right and just . Your survival and the survival of our people — as proud White people who do n't want to be blended away genetically , spiritually , or culturally is never unjust or out of sync . You have a right to be yourself . You have a right to your genetic identity . This is your planet as much as it is anyone else 's and no one has any more rights to anything than you do . That dirt under foot ? It is yours . That tree ? It is yours . No one got deeds to anything on this planet from Nature , and your rights come from Nature and ( if you to choose to so believe ) from Nature 's God .
Develop the mental strength and self-esteem to withstand those who hate Whites . Stay White . Breed White . Live White . Never criticize other Whites who are also awake and aware . Never side with non-Whites against Whites . Do not hate yourself or your fellow Whites .

German anti-fascist hackers have broken into the secure forum server of one of the world 's largest neo-Nazi groups , Blood & Honour , and copied more than 30,000 pieces of data .
Blood & Honour , founded back in 1987 in the UK by Ian Stuart Donaldson , leader of the notorious skinhead band Skrewdriver , has been banned in Germany since 2000 . The Spanish division was closed in 2005 after the arrest of many of its main leaders .
Last week , members of Daten-Antifa managed to break the access codes of the forum and copied roughly 800MB of data , including information that was only available to members .
In a statement the hackers said that the databases of the server was accessed in a `` laboriously prepared cloak-and-dagger operation '' which involved a `` house search '' .
The data , published online in a special zipformat , includes the IP addressses of 31,948 registrered users and information about at least 500 ( possibly even 1,200 ) German neo-Nazis .
German authorities had previously suspected B & H was used by members of the German neo-Nazi scene . `` Some people in the far-right extremist scene are going to get very nervous , '' Günther Hoffmann from the Center for Democratic Culture told the Frankfurter Rundschau .
However , police may not be able to do anything with the information , because the data was gathered illegally . ®
New population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau show the big gainers and losers among Buffalo Niagara neighborhoods .
Often , they 're right next to each other .
Twenty census tracts — either city or suburban neighborhoods or huge swaths of rural towns — showed gains of 15 percent or more over the past five years . But 11 of them adjoin tracts whose populations fell by 15 percent or more . Of the other nine tracts , five are also near big population-losing areas , a Buffalo News analysis of census figures shows .
Consider the City of Lockport . The population around the Erie Canal locks in the middle of the city dipped by nearly 24 percent , according to the census estimates . But it 's sandwiched between two tracts that each gained about 16 percent .
Buffalo 's Forest neighborhood — roughly bounded by Grant Street , the Scajaquada Expressway and West Delavan Avenue — grew in population by 42 percent . But the portion of the Black Rock neighborhood adjacent to the north lost 17 percent of its population , according to the estimates .
So while the region 's overall population has stabilized in recent years , each neighborhood 's story may be different , even from one a few blocks away . Hundreds may have left one neighborhood . And the neighborhood nearby could see skyrocketing growth thanks to student housing , immigrants and empty nesters .
`` Sometimes , if there 's some development taking place in a neighborhood , like a new building going up , you see a big bump in population , '' said Robert Silverman , a professor in the University at Buffalo 's Department of Urban and Regional Planning .
It 's common for communities to see population fluctuations as new developments are built and deteriorating housing comes down . When looking at census data involving small geographies , modest changes in development can have a big impact , they said .
The 2016 census estimates released last week are based on five years of sampling .
The data indicates immigrants and students are driving pockets of explosive population growth . Neighborhoods in Clarence and Lancaster are hot spots for retirees . And parts of Lockport and Wheatfield continue to grow , despite falling numbers elsewhere in Niagara County .
But the spine of Broadway , running through Buffalo and Cheektowaga , emerges as a miles-long stretch of residential flight .
Interactive map below . Story continues .
Erie County
Buffalo . Pockets of the city have seen a marked increase in population , like the Central Business District , where new apartments and lofts have opened . That 's also the case in the area west of SUNY Buffalo State , where multistory buildings for student housing have been built .
But trouble spots abound .
Neighborhoods on the East Side , including Masten Park , Genesee Moselle and Kaisertown , as well as a string of neighborhoods along Broadway have lost thousands . And neighborhoods surrounding the Old First Ward have all seen declines since 2011 . So have some neighborhoods in the Elmwood Village and Allentown south and west of West Ferry Street .
Neighborhoods in and around University Heights , in the northeast corner of the city , have experienced population declines ranging from 9 percent to 23 percent over the five-year period — a loss of more than 1,800 people .
That comes as a surprise to Common Council Member Rasheed Wyatt , who represents the University District , including the neighborhoods that have been the subject of complaints by residents about partying student renters .
`` That 's kind of startling , but something I 'm quite concerned about , '' they said .
In the past few years , he 's seen an influx into the University District from New York City transplants and immigrants , particularly from Bangladesh . The University at Buffalo is also working to encourage more professors to move into the area .
`` It may be turning around now , '' they said .
First-ring suburbs . Population shifts are a mixed bag in the suburban towns closest to Buffalo — Tonawanda , Amherst , Cheektowaga and West Seneca . Some neighborhoods saw growth , others held steady and still others lost residents . These towns did not exhibit large townwide population swings , though Amherst saw the most growth at 2.6 percent .
Demand for off-campus student housing explains a nearly 21 percent increase in the population of the area just west and north of the University at Buffalo , said Ellen M. Kost , associate planner for the Town of Amherst .
Two developments account for the growth , they said . Twenty 91 North opened last year with 216 units containing 584 beds . And Villas on Rensch opened in 2012 with 150 units containing 610 beds .
This U-shaped area experienced the highest population growth in the town , and it borders the area of the town that saw the steepest population drop . The triangle-shaped area to the south , home to the Boulevard Mall and neighborhoods of single-family homes , saw an 8.6 percent drop , which town planners attribute to shrinking households in aging neighborhoods .
Cheektowaga saw some population growth in the northeast part of town , near the airport and Williamsville . But it saw double-digit declines in neighborhoods near the Walden Galleria . Just as in Buffalo , neighborhoods flanking Broadway showed a drop in residents .
Town Supervisor Diane Benczkowski said that as a realtor , they ca n't fathom the reasons behind the population loss and is surprised to hear it , though many residents have complained about vacant , zombie homes that have been abandoned by homeowners and taken over by banks . With stronger , grant-funded efforts to address the zombie home crisis , they said they believe troubled neighborhoods are turning around .
`` We have been working on this diligently , '' they said .
Lackawanna . The population in Lackawanna declined by 1 percent . The tremendous influx of immigrants , refugees and their relatives in the city 's First Ward , west of the railroad tracks that run north-south through the city , prevented a steeper decline .
`` There are a lot of new arrivals from different parts of the world , said Mohamed Albanna , First Ward councilman-elect and a longtime activist .
Albanna and current First Ward Councilman Abdulsalam Noman listed immigrants from West Africa , South Asia , Yemen , Iraq , Somalia and Syria .
Albanna also noted that nearly 50 new , rent-to-own homes have been built in the First Ward over the past several years , which is attracting residents . As new residents gain more wealth , more are also moving into other , more affluent parts of the city .
`` Without that , the loss of population would be more obvious than it is right now , '' they said .
The other neighborhood wards in the city either remained unchanged or lost population .
Second-ring suburbs . The second-ring suburbs , with the exception of the Town of Alden , have either remained stable or gained residents . Population growth is more obvious in the towns of Lancaster , Clarence and Newstead .
Lancaster and Clarence each had an influx of roughly 1,500 residents over the five years .
In Alden , the population fell , except for the census tract encompassing the Alden Correctional Facility and former Erie County Home , which grew by more than 900 people . The surrounding part of the town had the steepest population loss among rural towns . The town lost 1,500 residents from 2011 to 2016 , according to the data .
Town Supervisor Richard Savage said they have not noticed any such decline .
In Clarence , once a largely rural town with some high-end properties , residents clearly feel the population growth of more than 5 percent . Clarence is a mix of high traffic areas , such as the Main/Transit corridors to the south , and farmland to the north .
`` Our town houses are being sold almost as fast as they are being built , '' Clarence Supervisor Patrick Casilio said about the southern end of town where development and traffic have surged .
The population increase is not affecting the Clarence school district because it 's mostly older adults past child-raising age who are looking to downsize . They 're moving into townhouses or patio homes .
Compared to the Northtowns , the population in the Southtowns has remained largely unchanged , with rural towns beyond Orchard Park , Hamburg and Evans showing no dramatic gains or losses .
Niagara County
Town of Lockport . The Town of Lockport has seen tremendous growth in neighborhoods within the Starpoint School District , according to the census data from 2011 to 2016 .
`` People like Starpoint , '' said Kathleen Sparks DiMillo of Hunt Real Estate . `` There 's been a lot of new builds . ''
The town reduced the minimum size for a home lot a couple of years ago in hopes of spurring residential development .
Supervisor Mark C. Crocker said the town as a whole has seen modest growth .
Until recently , Assessor Jill Lederhouse said , the newcomers were moving primarily from other places in Niagara County , but lately people are moving in from Amherst and Clarence .
`` They 're coming to Niagara County because they 're realizing we have just as much to offer — more land , better prices , '' DiMillo said .
City of Lockport . Downtown Lockport is losing people . The estimates show the areas encompassing the downtown business district and the blocks immediately surrounding it have lost more than 500 residents , drop of nearly a fourth .
`` We know that 's an area we 've got to focus on , '' said Brian M. Smith , the city 's planning and development director .
The Greater Lockport Development Corp. is working on a plan specifically targeted for South Street , a dilapidated neighborhood in the area .
But Smith said a consultant 's report connected with the project disagrees with the census estimate .
`` There 's actually a projected growth , '' Smith said , although they said that growth would be only 40 people .
Mayor Anne E. McCaffrey and Assessor Tracy Farrell said the overall report for Lockport , showing strong growth in the northern and southern areas and decreases everywhere else in the city , makes no sense .
Farrell said the largest number of real estate transactions is occurring in the eastern part of the city , and McCaffrey said there has been virtually no new home construction in the allegedly fastest-growing areas .
`` After reviewing the census maps , I can not explain the increase in population in the two census tracts in the City of Lockport , '' they said .
Porter . The neighborhoods encompassing Youngstown and areas just to the south , between the Niagara River and the Niagara Scenic Parkway , showed some population growth , though locals leaders and realtors find that hard to believe .
`` I do n't see much development there , '' Porter Supervisor Merton K. Wiepert said . `` Where are they all living ? ''
`` What I 'm seeing is wealthy people buying homes — I 'm talking $ 250,000 homes — knocking them down and building large replacement homes , '' Assessor Susan Driscoll said . `` But there 's not a lot of vacant land . ''
More broadly , the town is losing residents , according to the data .
Wheatfield . The more heavily populated communities in the northern sections of the Town of Wheatfield continue to grow . The areas north of Niagara Falls Boulevard added an estimated 760 residents during this time period .
Supervisor Robert B. Cliffe said a chunk of that census tract lies within the Starpoint School District , which is considered attractive to young parents .
`` There are several developments there , '' Cliffe said . `` I can believe 700 [ new residents ] over the last seven years . That 's only 100 a year . ''
But they said the town 's building boom was squelched by the 2008 financial crisis . Wheatfield was seeing as many as 200 new houses per year before that .
`` In the last couple of years , I do n't think we 've hit 30 , '' Cliffe said .
Niagara Falls . The City of Niagara Falls remains the most glaring trouble spot for Niagara County . Two of the three biggest areas of population decreases countywide can be found in the city .
That includes the center city area , bounded roughly by 11th and 18th streets and Pierce and Niagara avenues .
`` You look at any matrix and that 's a neighborhood in need , '' said Seth Piccirillo , city community development director . `` I would say the reasons people are leaving are a lack of quality housing options and public safety . ''
They noted that True Bethel Development soon will be opening an apartment building in the former Sacred Heart School on South Avenue , which should boost the neighborhood 's population .
The downtown area , including several blocks as far north as Augustus Place and as far east as Eighth Street , was also shown as losing population , though Piccirillo does n't believe the census numbers are accurate in this case .
`` We 've had at least 35 residential units opening there , '' Piccirillo said . `` We know there 's positive development in the city . ''
Reporters Nancy Fischer and Joseph Popiolkowski contributed to this story .
Henning Schnaars , who works for a shipping company in the northern German port city of Bremen , is standing with their two trolley cases on the side of a road in Libya . They have just been handed their first setback .
Schnaars stands with their back to the Benghazi airport , looking at a billboard . It depicts Libyan revolutionaries with outstretched arms and making the V-for-victory sign with their fingers . At the bottom of the billboard are the words , written in capital letters , `` Merci La France . ''
`` Oh , well , '' Schnaars says . At the moment , the French are n't exactly their favorite people .
Schnaars landed in Benghazi an hour ago and has just finished meeting with the airport 's new director . It was a short conversation , with not even enough time for the coffee they had expected to be served . The director , who returned to Libya from exile during the civil war , had cut the meeting short after apologizing profusely , saying that they unfortunately had another appointment .
Schnaars was annoyed . They stood up reluctantly , took their briefcase and made their way to the door . It opened , and a delegation of well-dressed Frenchmen walked in , some wearing sunglasses . They saw a stocky German who had n't had enough sleep and was standing there in their shirtsleeves without a jacket . A few of the Frenchmen grinned . One wished Schnaars `` good business '' as they walked by .
Schnaars was served their coffee , but it was in the waiting room , where they could hear their Libyan host enthusiastically greeting the French delegation through the closed door .
Punished for Its UN Abstention
Schnaars has come to Libya to re-establish their business here after the war -- and after Germany 's abstention in the March 2011 United Nations Security Council vote to militarily intervene in the Libyan civil war . Schnaars , 55 , a member of the Worphausen Volunteer Fire Department and a fan of small-town fairs , is the head of logistics for Carl Ungewitter , a family-owned shipping company in Bremen with 50 employees , which specializes in shipments to Libya . For more than 30 years , Ungewitter has been shipping parts for pipelines , asphalt pavers , oil rigs , cranes , excavators , trucks and all the other pieces of equipment needed to transform a desert into an industrialized country .
Business was going fairly well despite the unpredictability of Libya 's leader at the time , Moammar Gadhafi , a man who once tried to dissolve Switzerland with the help of the UN because the Swiss had dared to arrest their son , and who once had Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death because they had allegedly infected Libyan children with AIDS .
Then , a year ago , the rebellion began in Libya , and things went sharply downhill for Ungewitter from there . Hardly any money left the country for nine months , which is a long time for a mid-sized company in Germany . If the company had n't had a source of natural asphalt in a lake in Trinidad , some of which was used to resurface a major road in the western German state of Hesse , things would have been bleak for Ungewitter . Instead , it only managed to avoid bankruptcy by cutting back employees ' working hours under the German government 's Kurzarbeit ( short-time working ) program .
Still , by the end of last year , Libyan companies still had outstanding debts to Ungewitter in the six-figure range , and there were rumors that Libya 's second-largest oil company was refusing to work with German companies anymore . That was because the Germans -- unlike the French -- had n't sent in fighter jets in March 2011 but , instead , looked on as Gadhafi 's troops massacred their fellow Libyans .
Business and Freedom
Schnaars has come to Libya to find out what the situation is really like . Of course , they also want to reduce the amount of money still owed to their company . They have brought along a suitcase full of unpaid invoices , and they hope to collect payment from the companies for which Ungewitter had organized shipment of goods .
Like Ungewitter , many German companies have done business in Libya , including the construction company Bilfinger Berger , oil producer Wintershall and technology giant Siemens . Until 2010 , Germany was the Libyan dictatorship 's second-largest trading partner , with only Italy doing more business with Gadhafi .
German politicians could not possibly benefit from being associated with Gadhafi , which led Germany 's political parties and their affiliated foundations to keep their distance . Even today , after the war , employees of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation are the only ones venturing into Libya . Ironically , it is the foundation maintained by the business-friendly Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) , the party of Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle , who was primarily responsible for wriggling Germany out of involvement in the conflict .
`` These are no longer the days when the clever white man goes to Africa to explain the world to people there , '' says Ronald Meinardus . They and a few Egyptian colleagues landed in Benghazi soon after Schnaars ' arrival . Now Meinardus is driving around the city to get a look at it . They are the organizer of a conference on the subject of freedom to be held in a Benghazi hotel over the next few days .
Meinardus is the Friedrich Naumann Foundation 's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa . The 57-year-old lives in Cairo and wears custom-tailored shirts with their monogram stitched into the chest pocket . They walk through the dusty Libyan streets in polished shoes , hoping to drum up support for economic liberalism among the Libyan people .
If Meinardus is successful with their conference , and if they manage to have their ideas about freedom take root in a new Libya , they could pave the way for the long-term success of Schnaars , the logistics manager , and the shipping company they work for . The FDP and its foundation are n't just interested in freedom ; they also seek to promote the free market economy .
Trying to Sow the Seeds of Economic Liberalism
Meinardus and Schnaars are two of many people who have come to Libya on business since the end of the war .
When Meinardus is asked why they do what they do , they reply : `` I love freedom . But please do n't print that . It makes me sound too much like a missionary . ''
They look out the window of their car until some graffiti catches their eye . Then they stop the car , gets out and contemplates an image of a German flag along with the words , in misspelled German : `` Duetschland & Austria : Ihr seid spät ! Aber vielen Dank ! `` ( Germany and Austria : You 're late ! But thanks very much ! )
Meinardus takes a picture of the graffiti , puts the image online via their Twitter account and writes : `` Very warm welcome from all sides during my first visit to Benghazi - vote in the UN Security Council is not a big deal here ( anymore ) . '' Meinardus ' trip is also an effort to make amends .
The next morning , Meinardus walks into a conference room at their hotel . About 100 Libyans are attending their conference , including liberal politicians , journalists and students . Meinardus gives a speech in Arabic in which they talk about freedom . The Libyans politely applaud .
'Wars Do n't Stop Themselves '
Meinardus is followed by a local politician who talks about the despot Gadhafi . But now the Libyans applaud loudly .
An old man wearing a little red hat shakes Meinardus ' hand and quotes , in perfect German , a `` freedom song '' from the former communist East Germany : `` Water does n't flow uphill on its own / And wars , too , do n't stop themselves . ''
`` I studied economics in East Germany , '' the man says , adding that they are now a member of a liberal Libyan party .
`` What do you think about the conference ? '' Meinardus asks .
`` It 's very good , but people are afraid . Liberalism is light , but it 's very bright for the Libyans . What do you call it when a room is without light ? ''
`` Darkness , '' says Meinardus .
`` Yes , Gadhafi was 42 years of darkness . ''
`` How strong would the liberal parties be if there were elections today ? '' Meinardus asks .
`` People would vote for the Islamists , '' the old man says .
Meinardus walks around the room until a young man in a tracksuit top gets up and blocks their path . `` You want to separate Islam from the state ? But that 's the opposite of freedom , '' they say .
`` No , no , '' Meinardus says . `` Liberalism also means religious freedom . ''
As Meinardus walks away , the man in the tracksuit top says that they believe liberalism is an ideology of infidels . `` We will rebuild Libya on our own , inshallah ( God willing ) . ''
Then they walk to the cold buffet .
Meinardus leans against the wall and says : `` I believe our job is to explain to the Libyans that liberalism is actually the will of God . ''
Given the Cold Shoulder
Schnaars , the logistics manager from Bremen , just wants to do business in the newly liberated Libya . They want to find out what conditions are like in the country , how its oil industry is doing and how people feel about the Germans , especially those who did business with Gadhafi . They want to get a feeling for how their company could further its business interests in Libya .
`` They actually want us , '' Schnaars says , sounding almost as if they were trying to convince himself . `` The really good shipping companies only exist in Germany and Japan . The others do n't really know what they 're doing . ''
Schnaars was in Libya for the first time 30 years ago , just after finishing their training as a shipping agent . They spent a year on a construction site in the desert that Carl Ungewitter had leased to another company . Schnaars has fond memories of those days . `` There was always good food , '' they say . `` They had their own kitchen . '' There was also beer , which was brewed on- site . In the evenings the men played Risk , a board game in which players try to conquer the world . `` There was no TV , '' Schnaars says , adding that there was also no overt evidence of the dictatorship . The Libyans they encountered , they say , did n't talk about those things -- and they never asked .
Schnaars sounds effusive when they talk about their past adventures . This time around , they say it feels like an adventure all over again , but for completely different reasons .
They park their car in front of an iron gate on the outskirts of Benghazi . The headquarters of the Arab Gulf Oil Company , or Agoco , are behind the gate . Agoco is the second-largest oil company in Libya . It supported the rebels early on in their struggle against Gadhafi , providing them with gasoline as well as trucks and tractor-trailers to transport weapons , ammunition and medications . Schnaars has heard that some of the managers here are no longer interested in working with Germans . If true , it will be a problem for Schnaars and their company because Agoco is an important customer .
To prove that there is a difference between the German government and a German company , Schnaars plans to talk about the research they have done on behalf of the new Libya . They will say that they have discovered some of Gadhafi 's accounts with a British bank , and that they have convinced government officials in Berlin to make sure that Agoco is removed from a European Union embargo list . `` I 'm the fifth column of the rebellion , '' he 'll tell their Libyan counterparts . It 's the same thing they told the airport director in Benghazi .
Schnaars walks into the Agoco headquarters building , carrying their briefcase full of invoices . In the afternoon , they leave the complex . They have been able to hand the invoices over to the bookkeepers , and they have spent a lot of time sitting around in hallways and waiting rooms . But they have received no answers to theirs questions .
The next day Schnaars , hoping to improve their luck , spends even more hours in the hallways , waiting rooms and offices at Agoco . They speak with managers . One tells them that Agoco is not happy with their company , while another says the opposite . Officially , the Libyans accuse them of having billed the company more costs than had been specified in an estimate for a particular order that was handled long before the war . But estimates are estimates , Schnaars says , and actual costs can sometimes be higher or lower than estimated .
The managers at Agoco seem unconvinced . They tell Schnaars that they do n't want to hire their company for one year , but that the final decision has n't been made yet . But at least they have spoken with them , and at least their meetings have yielded an outcome , if only a preliminary one . Schnaars suspects that the issue is politically motivated , and they know there 's nothing they can do about it .
Min Bahadur Sherchan was on a bid to reclaim a title that they lost to Japanese mountaineer Yuichiro Miura when they perished at Everest base camp ( AFP Photo/Prakash MATHEMA )
An 85-year-old ex-Gurkha who was attempting to reclaim their title as the world 's oldest person to summit Mount Everest died at base camp on Saturday .
Min Bahadur Sherchan was on a bid to reclaim a title that they lost to Japanese mountaineer Yuichiro Miura in 2013 .
`` He passed away at the base camp today at 5:14pm , '' Gyanendra Shrestha , an official with the tourism ministry who is at the 5,380 metres ( 17,600 feet ) camp , told AFP .
The former soldier became the world 's oldest climber to summit Everest in 2008 when they were 76 , but they lost the record five years later when Miura summited the 8,848-metre peak at the age of 80 .
Speaking to AFP this year before returning to Everest , the slightly hard of hearing grandfather said they just wanted to prove to themselves that they could still make it to the top of the world .
`` My aim is not to break anybody 's record , this is not a personal competition between individuals . I wish to break my own record , '' Sherchan told AFP from Kathmandu in February .
Sherchan 's death is the second fatality of the spring climbing season on Everest , which runs from late April to the end of May .
Experienced Swiss climber Ueli Steck died last month when they fell from a steep ridge during an acclimatisation climb .
Nearly 750 people will be attempting to reach the summit of the world 's highest peak during the narrow window of good weather that usually falls in mid-May .
Hundreds of climbers have been on Everest for weeks to acclimatise before making a bid for the top .
This year is particularly crowded as it is the last chance for climbers who were forced off the mountain by the devastating 2015 earthquake to use their extended permits . This has rasied concerns about dangerous traffic jams on the mountain .
Mountaineering is a major revenue earner for impoverished Nepal , home to eight of the world 's 14 peaks over 8,000 metres .
Wikipedia Announces The Most Edited Articles Of 2016
Enlarge this image toggle caption Katja Ogrin/Redferns/Getty Images Katja Ogrin/Redferns/Getty Images
Wikipedia , the free online encyclopedia , has revealed its most edited articles of the year . Some are completely unsurprising — like the articles about Brexit , the Panama Papers , the Orlando nightclub shooting , and other recent and controversial news topics . The popularity of editing others is somewhat more mysterious : like the article for RuPaul 's Drag Race , and one for a fictional character named Beverley Gray — the subject of a series of 26 mystery stories written between 1934 and 1955 .
The article on Vincent Van Gogh was also edited thousands of times in 2016 , as editors reportedly sought to clarify misunderstandings about the artist in hopes of achieving `` featured '' status for the page .
The most edited article by far was for Deaths in 2016 , which was edited 18,230 times . David Bowie , Janet Reno , Gwen Ifill , Leonard Cohen , Fidel Castro , Muhammad Ali , John Glenn and Prince are among the notable people who died this year .
Donald Trump 's entry was second , with 8,933 edits as of Dec. 21 . If history is any indication , there 's a good chance the president-elect 's Wikipedia page will come under even more scrutiny : The Wikimedia Foundation revealed earlier this year that George W Bush 's article has the most edits of any article in English in the history of the site , with 45,862 revisions at last count .
In an era when fake news has become dangerously prevalent , the job of a Wikipedia editor might be more important than ever . To this point , the Wikipedia entry for `` Fake news website '' has become increasingly popular in the past month — with nearly 1,000 edits to the site in the first two weeks of December alone .

In its first major disclosure about money held in Swiss banks , the government today said Rs 4,479 crore is held in accounts owned by Indians , who figured on the HSBC list , and the Income Tax Department has initiated action against 79 of such account holders.Besides , the tax department and other agencies including Enforcement Directorate are probing cases involving unaccounted wealth totalling Rs 14,957.95 crore within India.In case of suspected black money abroad , the disclosure relates to a list of 628 Indians , who figured on a list of account holders in HSBC 's Geneva branch that India had got from the French government.Out of these , no balance has been found in the case of 289 accounts , according to a report of the Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) on black money which was submitted to the Supreme Court . `` Out of the 628 persons , 201 are either non-residents or non-traceable , leaving 427 persons cases as actionable cases , '' an official statement said while releasing `` relevant portion of the second report of SIT on black money '' .The amount involved in these cases is about Rs 4,479 crore . Of this , the Income Tax Department has finalised assessment for 79 entities involving more than 300 cases . `` An amount of Rs 2,926 crore has been brought to tax towards the undisclosed balances in the accounts relating to these persons , '' the statement said , adding that taxes along with interest at applicable rates have been levied . `` Penalty proceedings under Income Tax Act , 1961 have been initiated in 46 cases .

Two UK hospitals abolished a ban on the use of e-cigarettes Thursday thanks to overwhelming evidence showing they 're vastly safer than tobacco cigarettes .
A National Health Service Trust , which runs two hospitals in the city of Nottingham , revised its position on vaping in light of a groundbreaking report from the Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) , which enthusiastically endorsed e-cigarettes as a safer alternative to smoking .
An earlier report published by Public Health England concluded e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than tobacco cigarettes .
“ We have a duty to help our patients and staff make healthy life choices , and ca n't ignore the potential benefits of electronic cigarettes as a nicotine replacement therapy , ” said Dr. Stephen Fowlie , medical director at the trust .
“ We 're now allowing e-cigarettes on our grounds to give our patients , staff , and visitors more choice in how they quit smoking , ” Fowlie added .
“ We need to encourage all patients and visitors who smoke and find it difficult to abstain while in hospital grounds to use medicinal nicotine or an electronic cigarette , ” said Professor John Britton , a respiratory consultant at the trust and contributor to the RCP report .
The RCP 's position is e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than regular cigarettes and are likely to be hugely beneficial to public health . ( RELATED : Game Changer : World Leading Medical Group Backs E-Cigarettes )
“ This report lays to rest almost all of the concerns over these products , and concludes that , with sensible regulation , electronic cigarettes have the potential to make a major contribution towards preventing the premature death , disease and social inequalities in health that smoking currently causes in the UK , ” said Britton , who also chairs the RCP 's Tobacco Advisory Group . “ Smokers should be reassured that these products can help them quit all tobacco use forever . ”

The people behind gritty survival shooter Metro Exodus are designing the game to be the best of the Metro series and the best of the STALKER series - combined .
Metro Exodus was unveiled during Microsoft 's E3 2017 media briefing last week with an eye-catching trailer that suggested the series had gone open world .
While it 's not accurate to say Metro Exodus is an open world game , it does feature multiple large areas for players to explore alongside the more linear environments the Metro series is known for .
It 's this fusion of linear and non-linear environments that lends the game a STALKER feel . STALKER was not a true open world game ; it was made up of 18 different maps , each separated by loading screens , that combined to form The Zone . You could only transfer from one area of The Zone to another at specific passageways .
Metro Exodus ' similarity to STALKER should come as no surprise - many of the people at developer 4A Games created STALKER : Shadow of Chernobyl while at Ukrainian studio GSC Game World .
Speaking to Eurogamer at E3 , creative director Andriy `` Prof '' Prokhorov , who was also lead designer on STALKER , said the initial idea for Metro Exodus was to blend the two series together .
`` From the beginning it was the idea that , because of our experience on STALKER and our experience on Metro , it would be easy to make a friendship between these two projects , and we would meld them easily .
`` It was not easy because immediately when the player received freedom , it was difficult to control their narrative gameplay . But we are satisfied with what we are seeing now , and we definitely believe other people will like that . ''
Executive producer Jon Bloch reiterated the point :
`` It 's the goal to try and find that fusion , to make something fun out of what we enjoyed from STALKER and Metro and what we think the fans will enjoy from both . ''
To that end Metro Exodus takes the action outside of the Moscow tunnels the series is known for and into the open , with protagonist Artyom seeking out a new place to live over the course of a year . The developers welcomed the change in scenery . `` We spent 10 years in the tunnels , '' Prof said . `` Everybody was like , let 's do something more , let 's smell the air . ''
The developers have expanded weapon customisation so you can change attachments .
So , how exactly does Metro Exodus work ?
Bloch describes it as a `` sandbox survival '' with linear levels that build upon the classic Metro gameplay from the previous games . Layered on top of both is an overarching storyline .
`` You 'll play in the classic linear style levels , and then you 'll play in the non-linear levels , and you 'll move between the two , '' Bloch said .
`` In the non-linear levels you do have freedom . There is story inside of each of those levels that will carry you through them , but you can make the choice to explore and find other things to look at and interact with and immerse yourself in the environment and learn about the world and everything that 's going on in that area and the people who live there . But it 's still a story-driven game that will carry you through the whole journey . ''
As for these non-linear levels , Bloch said they 're larger than any levels 4A Games has ever created . `` In Metro Last Light there was a swamp level that was above ground and it was relatively open , '' they said . `` But that dwarfs in comparison to what we 're doing in the non-linear levels we have now . They 're pretty large . There 's hours and hours of gameplay . ''
Metro Exodus , which has been in the works for three years , continues on from the good ending of Last Light . Artyom joins forces with a small group of survivors and boards a train to escape the ruins of Moscow . They want to figure out what 's out there , to find a new place to live and see what the world is like . The game takes place in post-apocalyptic Russia , as you 'd expect , but it occurs over the course of a year , so you 'll experience the four seasons . ( The game 's trailer revealed an environment from later on in the game , and so takes place in the autumn . )
4A Games said to think of the Metro Exodus reveal trailer as choreographed , but insisted it is representative of gameplay .
Metro Exodus ' reveal trailer hit the headlines for its impressive visuals and level of detail , but some wondered whether it was representative it was of what we 'll play when the game itself comes out in 2018 .
Bloch insisted the trailer `` is representative of gameplay '' and was captured from a gameplay sequence at the end of a level that takes place later on in the game . `` But we did do things to tighten it up a little bit , '' they explained .
`` We had restrictions for how long our trailer could be , so we had to make sure we were showing all the things we wanted to show . Maybe think of it more like it 's choreographed . But it is representative of gameplay and visually of what the game looks like . We did things like turn off HUD and quick time prompts , but that 's what the game looks like . ''
As for gameplay systems , Bloch said the team has built upon the gameplay of the previous Metro games . For example , weapon customisation has been expanded upon . Resource management returns , scavenging for resources is once again a key part of the game and the watch that tells you how much time you have for the filters that protect you from the poisonous air on the surface , or the toxic pockets of air caught in the Metro system , also makes the cut . And of course the iconic Metro gas mask is back , but there 's more to it this time around . `` In Last Light we added the wiping of the mask , '' Bloch said . `` There are additional things like that we 've added for this one as well . ''
And as you can see from the trailer , you do n't have to wear the mask all of the time .
`` You saw in the trailer that they take the gas mask off so obviously there are areas now above ground where you do n't need the gas mask to breath , '' Bloch said , `` but there will be some where you do . And there are still places below ground where you need the gas mask , or not . ''
4A tried to emulate the quality of the train steam seen in Red Redemption 2 's trailer for Metro Exodus .
The reveal of Metro Exodus certainly got fans of both Metro and STALKER talking - and the reaction has not gone unnoticed by the developers at 4A Games .
`` It was a lot of fun reading comments , '' Prof said . `` Hey guys , technically the new Metro is not in a Metro . Stop complaining ! Do you understand that this way we are receiving STALKER 2 ? ! ''
An official STALKER 2 was once in development , but it was cancelled as GSC Game World collapsed back in 2011 . GSC reopened in December 2014 , but there has been no word so far on a new game in the series . Back in March I asked GSC about the future of STALKER , given 2017 marks the 10-year anniversary of Shadow of Chernobyl , but was told there was no news to share .
An official STALKER 2 , then , looks increasingly unlikely . Thankfully it seems we have a spiritual successor on our hands with Metro Exodus .
When the NHL lockout finally ends , the next phase of Vancouver Canucks goalie Roberto Luongo 's career begins . It 's expected he 'll be traded as Cory Schneider inherits the team 's starting goaltender gig . The most widely speculated destination ? The Toronto Maple Leafs .
That said , is n't selling a Luongo Leafs jersey in an Ontario sporting goods store just a little presumptuous ?
Scroll to continue with content Ad
That photo was captured by Andrew ( @ manbearpiglpu ) at Pro Image at the Upper Canada Mall in Newmarket , and quickly spread around social media networks — including on Luongo 's unofficial ( but frequently confirmed ) Twitter feed :
Well-played .
The presumptuous jersey has been seen here and there in the NHL 's history . Vincent Lecavalier Montreal Canadiens jerseys were seen for sale around the NHL All-Star Game . The Philadelphia Flyers most recently had jerseys for Shane Doan created before they re-signed with the Phoenix Coyotes , although they were n't for sale .
Why did Pro Image decide to start selling Roberto Luongo Leafs jerseys before the team can even trade for him ? We decided to find out .
First off , it 's a Luongo jersey , rather than jersey ( s ) . And you can thank the lockout for it .
It went up about two weeks ago , as Leafs jerseys ( or really anything hockey ) have n't been moving during the work stoppage . One of the store 's owners decided to create something to garner a little buzz and attract some eyes to the hockey merch : a sweater for Roberto Luongo , No . 1 , Leafs goalie .
`` It 's just like a conversation thing we got going on . Trying to get people to talk about something other than the lockout , '' said Luigi Taddeo of Pro Image .
Story continues
So they created one jersey and stuck it on a rack of non-Luongo jerseys to make it look like a full shipment had arrived . Soon , they had customers coming in uttering `` Did Luongo just get traded to the Leafs ? ! ''
`` It 's pretty easy to change if things do n't work out , '' said Taddeo .
It is actually for sale , although they have n't sold one yet . Leafs player sweaters run $ 179.99 on the Pro Image website — and they 're in-store for 30-percent off the retail price , like the other NHL jerseys available .
The discounts are a necessity to move product , as the lockout 's been particularly frustrating for Toronto-based sports retailers . The 2013 Winter Classic was to feature the Leafs in a new sweater for the game — which would have been a windfall for places like Pro Image .
`` Last year , we had record sales in October . The Leafs had just released a retro third jersey , '' said Taddeo . `` People like to make fun of Leafs fans , but there are no other fans that support their team like Leafs fans do . ''
Hence , when the lockout ends , Taddeo 's hoping that Roberto Luongo 's tenure with the Leafs begins .
`` If Luongo were to ever be traded to the Leafs , it would be one of the better selling jerseys that we 've had , '' they said .
And just imagine how many they 'll move when they lead them to the Cup ! ( Just carrying the theme of presumption to its illogical conclusion here ... )

Young Brian Crooks ( courtesy of the Chicago Tribune )
Recently , there was a Facebook post by Brian Crooks , a 31-year-old Black man , recounting the racism and challenges they faced as a Black boy coming of age in a predominantly White Chicago suburb . That post has since gone viral . An Bridge version of the post was published by the Chicago Tribune , entitled `` What it 's like to be black in Naperville , America . '' It 's a lengthy article , but there is much to gain from this genuine and heartfelt narrative .
I was raised polar opposite , living in an all-Black public housing project on Chicago 's south side . But my unique ability to run a football earned me a scholarship to Northwestern University . Attending Northwestern was life changing . Though only a forty-five-minute drive north from the south side to Evanston , Illinois , it was indeed a new world .
I knew the transition from the streets of the Richard Flower Homes to the halls of Northwestern would be a struggle . I expected most of the student body to be spoiled rich kids , who I had little in common with , but I always took comfort in the fact that I would have my fellow Black teammates . I figured most of them were like me and passed through admissions by the skin of their teeth . Their athletic ability afforded them this opportunity ; otherwise , their family could n't cover a fraction of the steep tuition .
In reality , I was surrounded by privileged kids of all races . Most of my teammates came from the upper-middle class . These were the sons of top bank executives , surgeons , former professional athletes , sports agents , and TV broadcasters .
Something I discovered early from our conversations is that the majority of my Black teammates had White girlfriends and most of the ones who were single preferred to only date White girls . I found that bizarre , especially sinse I had never even kissed a White girl before . `` Do these guys want to be White ? `` , I thought . But it did n't take long to figure out that they were n't trying to be anything other than themselves .
When a Black boy grows up in a predominantly White middle-class neighborhood , they will culturally identify with the White race more than their own . Not because they are an Uncle Tom or White boy with a tan , he 's simply a product of their environment . Their love for White girls is no different than my love for around the way girls -- with at least two pairs of bamboo earrings .
I remember one of my Black teammates showing me a photo album from their senior prom . There must 've been over fifty photos . As I flipped through , I never saw another Black person besides him . From their date , to all the other couples , they were the only one . But that did n't seem to bother him . In every photo , they smiled full of glee and gave thumps up with their Caucasian comrades .
As a child , you do n't get to make decisions about where you live or attend school . As minority parents , we are tasked with the duty to provide the most balanced experience for our children -- not the most white balanced . If you 're an affluent Black couple , is it necessary to move into a ritzy White neighborhood and send your children to the best school money can buy ? Does diversity factor into the equation or is it an afterthought ? My heart breaks for a young Brian Crooks ( and my college teammates who were forced into similar circumstances ) . The same way it shatters for Lawrence Otis Graham 's sons , who are being taught how to navigate the landscape of an environment in which they are tolerated not accepted .
Lawrence was under the delusion that their elite status would insulate their boys from racial discrimination . They believed by teaching them to act and dress less urban , it would protect them from being profiled by the neighborhood police . Unfortunately , there is no degree of conformity that will insulate you from racial profiling . You can change the pitch of your voice . You can alter the way you dress . You can pack your lunchbox with smoked salmon instead of fried Bologna . You can extract all remnant of Black culture from your existence . But you ca n't change the color of your skin -- nor should you desire too .
We hear much about `` White flight , '' but its Black flight , the move of successful Black city-dwellers to the suburbs to escape dangerous Black neighborhoods , that has decimated the Black community . White suburbs are as much of a status symbol as they are a safe haven . Like most of my friends , I was conditioned to believe that success meant making it out of the projects -- out of my neighborhood . Everyone 's goal is to get out . By virtue , those who are left behind are viewed as underachievers . Those who are successful in their quest often never look back . What is left is a Black community devoid of people with the education and financial capital to uplift it .
We must stop living in fear of each other , retreating to predominately White suburbs for safety . We all say we want `` better '' for our kids , but subjecting them to an environment where no one looks like them hardly constitutes better . I want the most enriching experience for my children as possible . This goes far beyond school ratings and median incomes . There is a sociocultural component that is equally important , one that no leafy gated community in White suburbia can cultivate .
I recognize that fear is not always the motive . Black folks choose to live in predominately White suburbs for the same reason Black students flock to Private White Institutions ( PWIs ) , in lieu of struggling Historically Black Colleges and Universities ( HBCUs ) , they 're where most of the resources are held hostage . As a father of three , I understand . However , I also realize that this Black-flight model will never fix the fiscal problem in Black America .
What if successful Black folks decided to stay put and build up their own communities ? Where would the resources be ? What if the thousands of exploited collegiate football and basketball players , who are predominately Black , decided to take their talents to HBCUs instead of PWIs ? Where would the multi-million dollar network contracts reside ? We have more power than we think , if we can only unify .
For those who do n't know , I work part time at a library of rare books and manuscripts . It often involves stamping books , organizing magazines , opening the mail , filing receipts , and loading packages into the freezer . Recently , it involved putting a giant collection of Haldeman-Julius Little Blue Books in numerical order . They are small 3.5″ x 5″ books published in Girard , Kansas , during the early- to mid-20th Century . The books include everything from Shakespeare and Ibsen plays to the U.S. Constitution and French-to-English guides . One that caught my eye was # 56 , A Dictionary of American Slang .
Included in it were some things that we still use today , like geezer , gold digger , high jack , and hot dog as an exclamation . But there were also some things that I have never heard of , and some of the definitions were just as strange . So , without further ado , some examples of ~1920s slang :

acknowledge the corn – admit responsibility for
Adam 's ale – water

izzum-wizzum – hotsy-totsy , red hot sweetie
Jericho ( to send one to ) – Hell , or Hoboken

piffle – nonsense , twaddle , applesauce , stewed rhubarb

V spot – five dollar bill
whangdoodle – mythical creature , akin to the gymnascutus , leg shorter on one side than the other , to let them feed n a hillside ; nonsense
Iron man guy ( Tony ? ) has a flashback of meeting two people they kinda uses and abuses . Of course the flashback is not just to fill up a movie . They return to the plot to cause pain and damage .
I guess maybe I have seen too many of these movies to know if my `` eh '' feeling about this one is just boredom setting in or if this movie really was boring . I mean it was good and all of that but it just did n't seem to have a kick to it . It also seemed to comment in a sly way on this or that in society as these types of movies do but they really did n't focus too much on them to really say much . I mean was the entire osama bin laden just to poke fun at him/mock him ? or was there something else there ? I mean if that had been in a movie circa 2004 then yeah it would have gone over well . But now ? Just kinda goofy . And the idea that a person would go so far to regrow a limb that they would kill many people . . . is that social commentary on the science community using killed children ( ie abortion ) to regrow limbs or is that just showing human weakness and self-centeredness ? I dunno . It was kinda mentioned in passing .
Anyway it is slow at first but all the blowing up and killing and smartelecky lines will follow soon enough .
A provincial court judge in Halton has taken on police in the region , releasing two bold rulings in less than a month rebuking officers for excessive force . One officer , Const . Erich Paroshy , who works out of Halton 's Burlington division , is named in both unrelated cases — one of which resulted in a man 's broken arm and the other with a man pepper sprayed in the face .
Ontario Court Justice Lesley Baldwin ruled in two separate cases in less than a month that Halton police used excessive force . ( Randy Quan / Toronto Star File Photo ) Kyle Davidson had their left arm broken in an incident with Halton police on June 20 , 2009 in Burlington . An Ontario court judge later cited excessive force by the officer involved . ( Sept. 21 , 2011 ) ( Barry Gray / The Hamilton Spectator ) Halton police Const . Erich Paroshy is the subject of two critical rulings by a Halton judge . ( TORONTO STAR )
In both rulings , Ontario Court Justice Lesley Baldwin came down hard on the officers and requested the Crown send a copy of their reasons to Halton 's police chief , Gary Crowell , “ for appropriate review and action. ” In the first ruling , they requested the OPP regional supervisor receive a copy as well as the province 's police watchdog . The first judgment prompted a baiting public challenge from police association president Duncan Foot , slamming the judge for their decision in a letter to a local paper . The first ruling was released Aug. 19 and the second , on Sept. 8 .

In the first , Baldwin acquitted Kyle Davidson of assaulting a peace officer , resisting arrest and being intoxicated in public in connection with a June 2009 arrest . Police believed the 26-year-old had kicked at the police cruiser of OPP Const . Ryan Cox , who testified that upon approaching the accused they responded by saying “ F -- - you. ” Davidson told the Star they swore at the officer only when they were on the ground . In the struggle to arrest him , Davidson 's left arm was fractured by Const . Paroshy , who arrived on the scene afterwards to assist . “ I do find , beyond a reasonable doubt , that Officer Paroshy used excessive force and broke Kyle Davidson 's arm in this case , ” said Justice Baldwin in their 16-page ruling , making clear that “ contempt of cop ” is not a justification for an arrest . Davidson said they have read the ruling “ like 75 times ” and added that they “ feels absolutely vindicated . I really doubted the system . ”
Baldwin went further in their ruling , calling police conduct in the case “ harsh and callous. ” They added : “ I sensed no empathy on the part of either officer for the injuries Kyle Davidson sustained in this matter. ” The judge recommended both officers be retrained in the appropriate use of police force and that the Special Investigations Unit be forwarded them reasons .

Late last month , SIU director Ian Scott reviewed the original investigation into Davidson 's injuries , and the judge 's reasons , and stuck to the decision to not lay charges . Scott suggested Paroshy , assisting in what they believed to be a lawful arrest , was not excessive given Davidson 's resistance . Last month , Crowell said Paroshy acted “ as we would expect them to ” by coming to the aid of another officer making an arrest . In a letter , published last week in the Burlington Post , Foot extended an open invitation to Baldwin , inviting them to attend a twice-yearly training session that includes a Use of Force component . “ Perhaps Justice Baldwin would like to find the time in their busy schedule to see what it is like to make a split-second decision in the face of battle , instead of sitting safely behind a bench , having hours or days to reach a decision , and then make disparaging comments about police officers trying to keep our communities safe , ” said Foot , who was not aware of the second ruling when they wrote it . In the Sept. 8 judgment , Baldwin acquitted brothers Bogumil and Stanislaw Dyrda of all charges , including assaulting a peace officer , stemming from an incident in January 2009 . According to court documents , Stanislaw was returning from dropping their daughter off at university in Ottawa when their car swerved off the road into a pile of rocks , deploying the airbag . Constables Paroshy and Blair Egerter responded to a dispatch around 10 p.m. and alleged that when they tried to get information from Stanislaw they responded by saying “ no. ” As they escorted them back to the cruiser , the officers testified they suspected Stanislaw was intoxicated and that they pushed themselves away from Paroshy . They were then placed under arrest , and as an altercation ensued , Paroshy alleged that Bogumil , having arrived on the scene after receiving a call from their brother , interfered by pulling off their bulletproof vest . Stanislaw was punched by the officers , taken to the ground by Egerter and pepper-sprayed by Paroshy . The brothers said that Stanislaw was not intoxicated , but exhausted from driving 17 hours and disoriented from the car crash ; also , that Bogumil was trying to diffuse the situation by offering to translate for their brother , who speaks little English . They denied trying to take off Paroshy 's vest . “ Their duty as officers was to determine if this man needed some help . Help was not what Stanislaw Dyrda got that evening . They got beaten , ” said Justice Baldwin in a 32-page ruling . “ At the end of this long trial , it was clear that this case involved the excessive use of police force. ” Baldwin rejected the officers ' evidence that they smelled alcohol , noting “ this important piece of information was not even recorded in Officer Egerter 's notebook. ” They also questioned Paroshy 's testimony about the vest . The Dyrda brothers ' defence lawyer , Joseph Bloomenfeld , said Baldwin 's rulings “ exhibited great care and thoughtfulness ” and took “ courage. ” “ She had the strength to write a judgment that 's going to . . . impact on people that they deal with all the time , ” they said , referring to police officers ' role in court cases . Bloomenfeld added they believe the judgment has weight because of Baldwin 's hands-on work with police as a former Crown attorney . Reached Tuesday , Halton police responded by saying they were aware of Baldwin 's latest judgment involving two of their officers . “ We treat each and every incident on its own merit , and take appropriate action as required . Our Professional Standards Bureau is conducting an investigation into our officer 's actions in this particular case , ” said police spokesperson Dave Cross . Foot said it was not appropriate to comment on the latest ruling because of the internal investigation . “ However , I do want to state that I stand right beside Const . Paroshy and that this association will support them with whatever means are necessary , ” they said , adding that the association also supports officer Egerter .

The National Labor Relations Board was merely doing its job when it charged Boeing with making an illegal transfer of work to South Carolina for a second 787 production line , writes guest columnist Jeff Johnson , president of the Washington State Labor Council .
THE National Labor Relations Board complaint against Boeing has caused quite a stir . According to the NLRB charge , Boeing chose to set up its second 787 production line in North Charleston , S.C. , in retaliation against the Machinists ' Union because of repeated strikes against the company and the possibility the union could go on strike again .
On April 24 , The Seattle Times editorialized against the NLRB action [ `` Feds should n't reverse Boeing 's S.C. decision '' ] claiming both the union and the company are grown-ups and both know their rights . According to The Times , the union has a right to strike and the company has the right to build production facilities anywhere it wants within the confines of the law .
Both sides do have rights , but only one side , Boeing , violated the law . Boeing committed an unfair labor practice — not by putting its factory in South Carolina , a right-to-work state ; it broke the law when it made it clear to employees it was relocating because of strikes . This action created a chilling effect on its employees as well as the state of Washington .
The Washington State Labor Council , AFL-CIO applauds the NLRB general counsel 's decision . The NLRB is simply doing its job , defending the rights of workers to collectively bargain and to act in concerted activity . Were Boeing 's actions to go unchecked , companies would be free to coerce and intimidate workers , their unions and states into deals that primarily profit the company . This would make a mockery of the fundamental human right of workers to stand together in order to balance out the power of corporations .
Yet instead of simply having its day in court , Boeing is trying to use its tremendous political clout to stop the actions of this independent federal law-enforcement agency . It is trying to win politically because it can not win its case in a court .
The Washington State Labor Council , AFL-CIO , IAM , SPEEA and the many other unions that represent workers at Boeing want the company to expand production in Washington state . We want to design and produce the 787 and the next generation of 737s here . We have the most skilled machinists and engineers , the best aerospace apprenticeship program and a great public infrastructure to support the aerospace industry . But we want the company to treat its workers and the state fairly and to obey the law .
During the past 10 years we have demonstrated what we can accomplish when we work together . Organized labor has worked with our congressional delegation , Boeing and others to win the Air Force tanker deal . The recent tanker announcement is recognition of the commitment our state , our workers and our unions have made to Boeing and the aerospace industry . What we expect from the company is a commitment to locate design and production work in Washington state . We expect Boeing to stop the coercive work and political threats that continue to harm our state 's economic security .
The National Labor Relations Board issued the complaint against Boeing after a careful investigation , providing Boeing with every opportunity to defend itself . It even granted Boeing 's numerous requests for delay . In the end , the Board decided it was compelled to act in the face of Boeing 's admission that its move was motivated by its desire to avoid lawful collective bargaining .
Boeing claims that no current employees in the Puget Sound have been harmed by moving work to the second line and that employment in Washington state has increased . The truth is , every job on the unlawful second line in South Carolina displaces good middle-class , union jobs in Washington , and our communities and the state lose desperately needed revenue and economic activity .
Boeing admitted to retaliating against the union and in so doing made an illegal transfer of work . Rather than blaming the NLRB for doing its job , we should all be asking why Boeing proceeded so recklessly with so much at stake . Boeing , grow up and face your responsibilities .
Jeff Johnson is president of the Washington State Labor Council .

Facebook is useless
How about that for a ‘ Social ' network ?
If you pick up the phone and start calling people , you 'd reach more people than how many of your friends your Facebook post can reach . And it would be even faster .
Its worse if you have a community page , group , business page or the like – the reach can be lower than 5 % .
But how come it 's like this ?
This happened after Facebook introduced its EdgeRank ranking algorithm for posts . Supposedly , the EdgeRank is supposed to measure the ‘ quality ' of the content according to its ‘ virality ' and other ranking factors , and therefore ‘ make sure that people see the best content in their feeds ' .
In Corporatespeak it sounds spectacular as always of course . ‘ Way to go ' , one is inclined to say after reading it like that . “ Facebook sure has our best interests in mind ” … .
But naturally – of course not .
The aim of EdgeRank is mainly to reduce visibility of posts , and push Facebook Ads . They hit Facebook Pages with it first , and then they shamelessly carried it over to people 's own profiles , dropping it in the middle of your interaction with your own friends and family . Lets see how the racket goes :
Now , imagine you have a community page followed by 1000 people . And you posted something to share with every follower . But what 's that – your post reached only 50 people ! Whooops – here come Facebook Ads :
https : //www.facebook.com/marketing/posts/10150839503836337
So you see , Facebook wants you to pay up to reach the 51th person . Its official , its blunt , its as clear as it can be .
They say ~16 % of your fans , but that estimate is misrepresented – posts only reach ~5 % , and if one person likes/comments/shares , the post reaches a few more . As you can see from post of Facebook itself above , the average is ~16 % , so you can expect around 10-15 % of page 's followers to get the post on average , even with people interact with it . If a lot of people do not interact with the post , the post gets to much fewer people . ( source )
For more to see it , each of your posts need to be a Nyan cat or a mega hit grumpy cat post with massive virality…
One could say “ This is ok , since most of the pages are business related , so its natural that Facebook would try to reap ad money from them ” . But as we mentioned before , it does n't go down like that .
Pay up to show that family post to your uncle
Yeah , you heard right .
Facebook expected you to pay up for them to show your post about last weekend 's family trip photos to your uncle . ( source )
7 bucks . For each ‘ promoted ' post . Then ‘ more ' of your friends ( and family ) will see that post – a post from your PERSONAL profile to your OWN FRIENDS who happened to have chosen to connect with you on Facebook .
They discontinued this ‘ feature ' recently . Possibly due to massive criticism it received online – pay to reach your grandfather – what 's that… Though , you can be sure that its going to come back when Facebook thinks that asking you to pay is more acceptable at a point in future or they find another way to ‘ monetize ' your friends and family .
However the EdgeRank mess-up still stays – your posts still only reach 5 % of your friends , and it can reach up to 10-15 % of your friends if it gets good interaction , but that 's that .
It does n't matter if you and your friends/family turned on numerous options like ‘ follow ' , ‘ get updates ' , ‘ close friends ' and the like – your posts are crippled to that extent despite all of them being turned on .
Even if you and your friends constantly ‘ interact ' with each other 's posts through likes/comments/shares , you will still get reduced visibility among yourselves . And if you miss to ‘ interact ' with one or two post of one of your friends , you will suddenly start getting even fewer posts from them in your feed and the chances of you missing the post or missing interacting with it will become higher . Which will further reduce visibility , causing you to wonder whether a friend has stopped using facebook when you suddenly notice that you have n't been seeing stuff from him/her… . Only to discover when you go to their or their profile that s/he had been there , but you just have n't been seeing the stuff s/he posts .
Like a lot of other people did…
Why did it end up like that ?
Shareholders need their profits . Regardless of what – even at the cost of breaking the entire principle a service is based on – a natural result of our economic system and stock markets . Facebook had been looking for ways to ‘ monetize ' people 's connections and relationships , and this is the result .
So , now we have a ‘ social network ' in which a decimal fraction of ‘ social ' exists , but the shareholders are happy . ( source )
Except , for all accounts and purposes , Facebook is now 95 % useless as a social network and platform with near nonexistent social interaction due to crippled reach of any kind of information .
Really – get on a better social network as soon as you can . Better yet , join Diaspora – where no private or public entity can censor your posts or tell you what to do . That 's what Social Networks were supposed to be all the way from the start anyway…

By Alisha Green , Associated Press LANSING , Mich. ( AP ) -- Gin Hency and Annette Shattuck describe themselves as soccer moms , active in their communities and in their children 's lives . Since July 2014 , the St. Clair County women have shared another similarity : Both of their homes were raided by the St. Clair County Drug Task Force . Hency and Shattuck are registered medical marijuana caregivers . Among the things taken in the raid were their medical marijuana cards issued by the state , televisions , a bicycle and documents including driver 's licenses and insurance cards . `` It was devastating , '' Shattuck said . Hency and Shattuck were charged with marijuana-related counts several months after the raids . Three of the six charges against Shattuck were dismissed . Both charges against Hency were dismissed this month , but they have still been unable to reclaim their property . They are just two examples of people impacted by civil asset forfeiture in Michigan , a process by which someone 's assets may be forfeited if the property is judged to be related to crime , regardless of whether that person is ever charged or convicted . That 's because someone 's assets are tried in civil court , separate from the criminal process . House Republicans listed civil asset forfeiture reform as one of their priorities for this legislative session . A bipartisan package of bills , approved by a House committee Tuesday , would make changes including raising the standard for forfeiture to the highest in civil court , one of clear and convincing evidence rather than a preponderance of the evidence . The bills would also require detailed reports from local police to the state police on property forfeited . Reporting is now required for forfeited assets related to drug crimes , but not for other criminal activities . The Michigan State Police has not taken a position on the package , but a representative at a committee hearing expressed support for the added transparency . Rep. Jeff Irwin , an Ann Arbor Democrat and a sponsor of the package , said the new reporting requirements would help show how forfeiture is used around the state . `` To the extent it demonstrates these tools are being used against real drug kingpins , I think that will put the public 's mind at ease to some extent . I think that what we 're hearing anecdotally , which is very concerning , is that the tool is being turned against regular citizens too often , '' they said . Stephen Guilliat , chief assistant prosecutor for St. Clair County , could n't comment specifically on cases like Hency and Shattuck 's but said checks and balances are in the forfeiture system to make sure it 's done right . The office considers the rulings in criminal cases when determining what to do with assets going through civil court , but the outcome in one case does n't necessarily impact the outcome in the other , they said . Asset forfeiture is a tool that 's used to make sure crime does n't pay , Guilliat added , and all of the money generated by the process `` goes right back to the enforcement of the criminal laws of the state of Michigan . '' `` We will help fund things that otherwise we would n't be able to do , '' they said . Some advocates for reform say that 's part of the problem . The system `` creates an incentive for police to be more aggressive with enforcement '' as they look to fill holes in their budgets , Irwin said . Shattuck said the reforms would be `` a small step forward . '' `` Anything that is opening the conversation on reform is definitely a good thing because people are going to become more aware of it , '' Shattuck said . `` Because when we tell our story people say , 'That does n't happen . That does n't happen in America , they ca n't take your stuff without charging you . ' '' Even some who were once part of the forfeiture process now advocate for reform . Steve Miller worked for the Canton Police Department for 18 years , including five years on a special weapons and tactics team . They retired as a sergeant and now is a speaker for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , a group supporting legalization and regulation of drugs . They said after their time being involved with forfeiture in Wayne County , they believe the description of `` policing for profit '' is appropriate . Several other states have made changes to their civil asset forfeiture laws this year . New Mexico and Montana recently changed their laws to require a conviction for assets to be forfeited . Irwin introduced legislation last session that would require a conviction for forfeiture in Michigan . The bill never received a hearing .
Here they come , zooming to meet our thunder
At 'em boys , give 'er the gun !
( Give 'er the gun now ! )
Down we dive , spouting our flame from under ,
Off with one helluva roar !
We live in fame or go down in flame . Hey !
Nothing 'll stop the U.S. Air Force !
Your fight song :
Fight , fight , fight , fight , fight , fight ! Hold that banner nice 'n ' upright ! Crowd the line and fight , fight , fight ! Plunge 'er through and do it twice ! Wear your blue and wear your white , Wear them both ! Maybe have pride ! We might lose but that 's alright ! If we lose we 'll sigh sigh sigh ! Our boys F-I-G-H-T all night ! Our gals are fair and kind of nice ! Get pretty drunk before we fight ! Skully daboo kaboo razoo , juppy raboo we fight !
The Air Force 's fight song :
Via
Yea , Alabama ! Drown 'em , Tide !
Every Bama man 's behind you
Hit your stride
Go teach the Bulldogs to behave
Send the Yellow Jackets to a watery grave
Bama 's whole fight song is Nick Saban 's MAKE Their ASS QUIT speech set to nautical circus fanfare . Its already-blunt poetry is usually clarified by a postgame `` WE . JUST . BEAT . THE HELL OUTTA YOU . ''
Oh , the day of days is here
And the Bobcat will appear
Yes , the claws will fly and the Bears will die
On this day of victory !
Oh , the Bobcat dotes on fighting
And their courage is supreme
And when it comes to smiting
Bears and Mules are all the same
`` The day of days '' is often used to refer to things like the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II , the Biblical apocalypse , and a sports rivalry among some Division III colleges in Maine .
This is not Bates ' fight song proper , but it is a school song about a fight-doting so severe that not even bears and mules can be distinguished . These animals are easy to tell apart , unless you 're in a Bates Bobcat berserker rage .

We 'll drop our battle axe on Georgia 's head
When we meet her , our team will surely beat them
Down on old Georgia 's farm , there 'll be no sound
Till our bow wows rip through the air
When the battle is over , Georgia 's team will be found
With the Yellow Jackets swarming around
This is not from Georgia Tech 's fight song proper , which is the most LIT of all fight songs ( `` Like all the jolly good fellows , I drink my whiskey clear '' ... `` Oh , I wish I had a barrel of rum and sugar three thousand pounds '' ) , but from the post-extra point song . If you do n't want to include it , you might end up beheaded and buried in bugs .
Lafayette
There will be nothing left of you , left of you
For we must make just a few more touchdowns yet
Shout , rah , rah , tiger , Lafayette
Dig Lehigh 's grave both wide and deep , wide and deep
Put tombstones at their head and feet , head and feet
And from each sweater take away the L ,
Which Lafayette alone guards we
This is from an item titled `` Lafayette Fight Song 1898 '' not in current use . I think it should be .
Lafayette 's archrival Lehigh will be blotted from existence , Lafayette will score more points after that , and then a monument to the obliterated will be made just so it can be desecrated by Lafayette . And you kids think Urban Meyer runs up the score .
Up with Montana , boys , down with the foe
Good old Grizzlies triumph today
And the squeal of the pig will float on the air
from the tummy of the Grizzly Bear
New at Ted 's Montana Grill , the meal that provides dinner conversation even while you digest it !
( This has the same music as the Georgia Tech song above , plus some others . Yes , there is a contentious history . )
So , Demons forever stand and
Fight for dear old Demonland
HAIL
SATAN
We fight fast and furious , our team is injurious
Tonight Carleton College will sure meet its fate
No , Bountygate 's Gregg Williams did not attend St. Olaf .
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Lookin ' for a moonshine still
Strangers ai n't come down from Rocky Top ,
Reckon they never will
Sure is a shame what happened to those federal agents . Sure is . Not that I know anything about it .

Saw Varsity 's horns off !
Saw Varsity 's horns off !
Saw Varsity 's horns off !

First , in case you ever question A & M 's fightingness , this is not A & M 's fight song . A & M does not have a fight song . This is A & M 's `` War Hymn . ''
Second , this is `` Varsity '' :
University of Texas
So never stop
'Til the last gun is fired
And the score is told
Sock their kabinas , you Javelinas
Blue and Gold
Go you Javelinas
Fight for AMK ! [ repeat ]
Bust their old machines
Right between the eyes
This is the plot of the Terminator movies , but with more pig-like animals . I have asked Texas A & M-Kingsville what `` sock their kabinas '' means and will report back to you soon .
Sac State 's men will soon be routed
By our dazzling `` C ''
We 'll stomp 'em in the mud
Their green will turn to blood
In our hour of victory
Blood ! Drip drip drip
Blood ! Drip drip drip
Blood ! Drip ! Blood ! Drip ! Blood !
This comes from UC Davis ' version of the fight song Cal and UCLA fight over .
Vanderbilt
Dynamite , dynamite ,
when Vandy starts to fight
Down the field with blood to yield ,
if need be , save the shield
Gallons of the stuff ! The SEC 's real crimson tide ! We 'll float to Shreveport , boys , then blow shit up ! BLOOD AND EXPLOSIONS

Internet service providers who accept government funding in exchange for providing Internet access in rural areas were `` reminded '' this week that they 're not allowed to use the money for food , alcohol , entertainment , personal travel , and other expenses unrelated to providing Internet access .
The Federal Communications Commission issued a public notice with a `` non-exhaustive list of expenditures '' that can not be reimbursed . The list includes all of the above as well as political contributions , charitable donations , scholarships , payment of penalties and fines , club membership fees , sponsorships of conferences and community events , gifts to employees , and personal expenses of employees and family members `` including but not limited to personal expenses for housing , such as rent or mortgages . ''
The ban on using subsidies for food includes but is `` not limited to meals to celebrate personal events , such as weddings , births , or retirements , '' the FCC said .
This money comes from the Universal Service Fund ( USF ) , which is paid for by Americans through fees imposed on phone bills .
Commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Michael O'Rielly wrote that while `` the vast number of providers '' would not take advantage of the system , `` there are unfortunate examples to the contrary and spending on outrageous items has occurred . ''
Commissioner Ajit Pai detailed one example in a statement attached to the public notice :
Since 2002 , Sandwich Isles Communications [ in Hawaii ] has collected $ 242,489,940 from the federal Universal Service Fund to serve no more than 3,659 customers . During that same time , Albert Hee , the owner of Sandwich Isles 's parent company Waimana Enterprises and affiliate ClearCom , apparently used the company as their family 's personal piggy bank . For example , the companies apparently paid $ 96,000 so that Hee could receive two-hour massages twice a week ; $ 119,909 for personal expenses , including family trips to Disney World , Tahiti , France , and Switzerland and a four-day family vacation at the Mauna Lani resort ; $ 736,900 for college tuition and housing expenses for Hee 's three children ; $ 1,300,000 for a home in Santa Clara , California for their children 's use as college housing ; and $ 1,676,685 in wages and fringe benefits for their wife and three children .
Hee was convicted of federal tax crimes not specifically tied to the FCC funding , and they have n't been sentenced yet . Pai criticized the FCC for `` turn [ ing ] a blind eye to such conduct for so long '' and urged their colleagues to launch a full investigation of Sandwich Isles and `` recover whatever funds we can for the American taxpayer . ''
Pai said this week 's public notice and the recent suspension of USF payments to Sandwich Isles appear to be a reaction to Hee 's conviction . Sandwich Isles was spending $ 5.5 million more `` on corporate operations each year than similarly sized companies , '' and seven years ago dropped a $ 1.9-million-per-year lease with an undersea cable network to go with a $ 15-million-a-year lease with a company affiliated with Hee 's three children , Pai said .
The FCC-issued public notice said ISPs that use USF money for anything other than providing communications services to rural areas could have to give money back , face enforcement actions from the FCC , and be prosecuted under the False Claims Act .
Clyburn and O'Reilly said the rules still need changing . `` We remain concerned that certain expenses not related to the provision of service , such as for artwork and cafeterias , may oddly be permitted under certain readings of our rules , '' they said . `` These decades-old precedents , created under very different circumstances , must be realigned to reflect the Commission 's more recent reforms . We believe it is appropriate for the Commission to initiate a proceeding to address these issues in the coming months . ''
In August , the FCC used the USF Connect America Fund to award $ 1.5 billion in annual support to Internet service providers who pledged to serve 3.6 million homes and businesses . The carriers are required to provide 10Mbps Internet service at rates `` reasonably comparable to those in urban areas . '' They include AT & T , CenturyLink , Cincinnati Bell , Consolidated Telecom , Fairpoint , Frontier , Hawaiian Telcom , Micronesian Telecom , and Windstream . Frontier will also get money in Texas and California territories that it is purchasing from Verizon .
The head of the country 's leading labour association says they still have no idea how a major Pacific Rim trade deal will help Canadian workers , despite recent meetings with the minister responsible for the deal .
'Signing Does Not Equal Ratifying ' : Freeland on TPP read more
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘ Punch to the Gut ' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions , says director Corey Payette .
Hassan Yussuff , president of the Canadian Labour Congress , added that they do n't understand why Canada is signing on to the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership when there are still unanswered questions about how it will benefit Canada economically .
Canada will sign the TPP next week , International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland announced Monday , though they stressed that signing the deal does not mean it will be `` ratified . ''
The deal has to be debated and passed in Parliament in order to be ratified .
Yussuff said the TPP would cost Canada thousands of jobs in the auto sector and pave the way for foreign firms to bring their own workers to Canada rather than hiring locals , among other impacts .
They said that recent consultations with Freeland did not make clear to them how other parts of the TPP could mitigate any negative consequences the deal has for Canadian workers .
Yussuff added that during those consultations they were told the Liberals could not find an economic impact study of the TPP done by the former Conservative government , which signed the initial agreement .
`` I do n't think ( Freeland is ) able to provide a clear response as to what they think this agreement will do to offset the concerns we 're raising , '' Yussuff said . `` We do n't know yet , and I do n't think they know because they have no impact study to dismiss our concerns . ''
The TPP has also been criticized by investment arbitration experts as a gift to corporations that strips countries of their sovereignty to make way for business , while proponents say it opens up economic opportunities .
'Many Canadians ' have questions : minister
In an open letter to Canadians published Monday , Freeland promised a full and open debate in Parliament on the TPP .
After 70 consultations , they wrote , it is clear `` many Canadians '' have questions about how the deal will impact the Canadian economy .
Those uncertainties are reason enough not to sign the TPP , according to labour groups .
The CLC said it was `` disappointed '' Canada would sign on to the TPP , and Unifor , the country 's largest private union , said the deal was bad when it was first signed and it is `` bad now . ''
In a press release , Unifor said Ottawa should also engage in full and open debate with Canadians , not just Parliament , before ratifying the deal in Parliament .
In Ottawa on Monday , Freeland told reporters they have spoken to those in Canada 's labour sector , and not just union leaders .
`` It 's also been people who wear work boots , and that 's very important to me , '' Freeland said , adding they met with car plant workers in Oakville , Ontario to talk about the deal . `` We 've been hearing a variety of views , some people strongly critical , some voice strongly supportive . ''
Freeland said that having an open mind is `` critical to the process '' of debating and consulting on the agreement .
But the United Steelworkers union characterized its meeting with Freeland differently in an email to The Tyee .
`` It should be clearly noted that in no way has the government ever consulted with our union on the TPP , '' USW representative Alex McKinnon wrote . `` Our union has attended two CLC sponsored meetings ... but in no conceivable way , unless you 're a Liberal , can this be taken as consultation . ''
Meanwhile , Yussuff said the Canada Labour Congress is drafting a document detailing its concerns with the agreement to forward to Freeland .
They said they appreciate that the minister is open to dialogue , a change from their dealings with the previous Harper government .
The Tyee asked Global Affairs Canada , the department that oversees international trade , if it was true no economic impact study conducted by the former government had been found .
No response was received by deadline Tuesday .
Musk is also chairperson and a major shareholder in SolarCity .
Tesla had made an offer to buy SolarCity in June , but a deal was not certain because SolarCity had formed a special committee to review the offer .
The companies said SolarCity stockholders would receive 0.110 Tesla common shares for every share held , valuing SolarCity at $ 25.37 per share based on the 5-day volume weighted average price of Tesla shares as of Friday .
Based on Tesla 's Friday close , the offer works out to $ 25.83 per share — a 3.4 percent premium to SolarCity 's last closing price . ( Get the latest quote here . )
SolarCity 's shares , which had risen about 26 percent since Tesla first made the offer on June 21 , were down 3.75 percent at $ 25.70 before the bell on Monday . Tesla shares were up 0.51 percent at $ 235.99 .
In June , Tesla offered 0.122 to 0.131 of its shares for each SolarCity share .
The deal includes a `` go-shop '' provision that will allow SolarCity , which had market value of $ 2.62 billion as of Friday close , to solicit offers from other buyers through Sept. 14 .
Up to Friday 's close , Tesla shares were up 7 percent since the company first announced the offer .
Kim Jong-un bans Christmas , makes North Korea worship Grandma
Tubby Tyrant Bans Christmas
The world 's most unstable dictator is taking the war on Christmas to a new level . Christmas is no longer allowed .
From the New York Post :
“ Kim Jong-un is the Grinch who stole Christmas .
North Korea 's tubby tyrant wants the few Christians in the hermit state to spread cheer only to celebrate their grandma , Kim Jong-suk — not the birth of Jesus .
Jong-suk — who was born on Christmas Eve in 1919 — was an anti-Japanese guerrilla and Communist activist , wife of North Korea 's first dictator , Kim Il Sung , and former leader Kim Jong Il 's mother .
Much pay homage to the “ Sacred Mother of the Revolution , ” who died under mysterious circumstances in 1949 , by visiting them tomb .
The daffy dictator is so obsessed with banning Christmas that they even flipped out in 2014 when they found out that South Korea planned to erect a huge Christmas tree along the border . Amid threats of all-out war , the tree was never put up .
Human rights groups estimate that between 50,000 and 70,000 Christians are locked up in prisons that have been compared to concentration camps simply for their faith . ”

The Obama administration is working on a plan to liquidate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that future profits from housing sales and secondary market activity flow exclusively to privately-owned banks and financial institutions . President Obama made the announcement last week in a speech in Phoenix saying that they wanted to “ wind down ” the two Depression-era Government Sponsored Enterprises ( GSEs ) and put “ private capital ” at the center of their housing finance reform strategy . They reassured investors and bondholders that the government would still underwrite the pools of loans that are bundled into bonds and sold to investors as mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ) despite the fact that US taxpayers will receive zero compensation for the explicit guarantee . Obama has abandoned the pretense that economic policies have a public purpose . What matters is profits , Wall Street 's profits . Here 's an excerpt from Obama 's speech :
“ The thing I 'm here to talk about today : laying a rock-solid foundation to make sure the kind of crisis we just went through never happens again . That begins with winding down the companies known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . ”
Obama is being disingenuous . Fannie and Freddie were not responsible for the financial crisis , although the claim is frequently made by right-wing extremists . Private capital caused the Crash of '08 as this clip from Forbes points out :
“ It is clear to anyone who has studied the financial crisis of 2008 that the private sector 's drive for short-term profit was behind it . More than 84 percent of the sub-prime mortgages in 2006 were issued by private lending institutions . These private firms made nearly 83 percent of the subprime loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers that year . Out of the top 25 subprime lenders in 2006 , only one was subject to the usual mortgage laws and regulations . The nonbank underwriters made more than 12 million subprime mortgages with a value of nearly $ 2 trillion . The lenders who made these were exempt from federal regulations. ” ( “ Lest We Forget : Why We Had A Financial Crisis ” , Forbes )
Repeat : “ More than 84 percent of the sub-prime mortgages in 2006 were issued by private lending institutions. ” It was private-label subprime mortgages that triggered the panic in the secondary market that crashed the financial system . This has all been well documented .
Fannie and Freddie only got into the subprime business at the very end to shore up market share , but –as Forbes notes , “ The vast majority of subprime mortgages — the loans at the heart of the global crisis — were underwritten by unregulated private firms . These were lenders who sold the bulk of their mortgages to Wall Street , not to Fannie or Freddie. ” It was private capital that eased lending standards and produced the ALT As , the piggybacks , the liar 's loans , the ARMs and the other financial abominations that blew up the repo market , collapsed the shadow banking system , and sent global stock markets tumbling . This is the same private capital that Obama wants to use to replace the two GSEs who saved the home finance market from complete collapse following the Lehman default in 2008 . Here 's Obama again :
“ For too long , these companies ( F & F ) were allowed to make big profits buying mortgages , knowing that if their bets went bad , taxpayers would be left holding the bag . It was “ heads we win , tails you lose. ” And it was wrong .
The good news is that there 's a bipartisan group of Senators working to end Fannie and Freddie as we know them . I support these kinds of efforts , and today I want to lay out four core principles for what I believe this reform should look like .
First , private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market… . I believe that while our housing system must have a limited government role , private lending should be the backbone of the housing market . ”
Again ; private capital precipitated the crisis . This is not an arguable point . Fannie and Freddie were not engaged in predatory lending , nor were they selling toxic securities to gullible investors around the world , nor were they issuing mortgages to applicants who clearly had no ability to repay the debt . It was the banks and shadow banks . Privately-owned financial institutions are 100 percent to blame for the meltdown ; not FDR , not The National Housing Act , ( which gave us Fannie and Freddie ) not well-meaning but meddlesome liberal politicians , and not Alec Baldwin . Check this out from the Washington Post :
“ Private label loans “ defaulted at over 6x the rate of GSE loans , as well as the fact that private label securitization is responsible for 42 percent of all delinquencies despite accounting for only 13 percent of all outstanding loans ( as compared to the GSEs being responsible for 22 percent of all delinquencies despite accounting for 57 percent of all outstanding loans ) . ” ( “ No , Marco Rubio , government did not cause the housing crisis ” , Washington Post )
Repeat : Private label mortgages defaulted at 6-times the rate of mortgages that were issued by Fannie or Freddie . Obama is propagating a myth in order to hand over the lucrative housing finance industry to the same people who drove it into the ground . Their public relations team has created a narrative that supports their overall goals , which are to terminate the two progressive institutions that made homeownership affordable for millions of working Americans , and to provide government support for a new regime of toxic MBS that the banks intend to generate as soon as the legislation is passed by the US Congress . Here 's Obama again at their Orwellian best :
“ No more leaving taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions . We encourage the pursuit of profit – but the era of expecting a bailout after your pursuit of profit puts the whole country at risk is over . ”
Wrong again . There will be defaults , and plenty of them , and taxpayers will be on the hook for the losses , you can bet on it . Mortgage originators who comply with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) shockingly lax underwriting standards for a “ Qualified Mortgage ” , will not be forced to refund the money they lend to borrowers who fail to repay their mortgages . So the banks will get off Scott-free for mortgages that default while Uncle Sam will wind up taking the hit . The USG will also stump up 90 percent of the losses on government-backed mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ) that end up in default , while bondholders will face haircuts of just 10 percent . Check this out from Bloomberg :
“ The Corker-Warner bill , sponsored by five Democrats and five Republicans , would replace Fannie Mae ( FNMA ) and Freddie Mac with a federal reinsurer that would step in only after private capital had taken least 10 percent of the first losses on mortgage securities . The government would step in with more aid during a financial catastrophe . The measure was written with technical input from the Obama administration . ”
Obama Endorsement Builds Momentum for Housing-Finance Overhaul ” , Bloomberg )
So why should taxpayers pay for the losses of private investors ? Investors know the risks of investing , but they accept those risks to earn a higher return on their money . That 's how the game is played , everyone knows this . The taxpayer accepts no such risk nor do they stand to profit if the investment pans out , so they should n't be penalized when speculators ' bets go south . Also , a blanket-guarantee on MBS is a direct subsidy to Wall Street because prospective buyers of MBS will know these complex bonds are as safe as US Treasuries . ( which will boost sales . ) Why do the banks and mortgage originators get perks that no other industry gets ? Obama 's lamebrain idea creates an unfair competition for other investment vehicles . ( that do n't have gov-backing . ) It 's obvious that the policy was crafted by Wall Street and that Obama is merely acting as pitchman .
Keep in mind , that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently reporting record profits thanks to tougher lending standards and rising home prices . To date , they have repaid $ 130 billion of the $ 190 billion they borrowed from the Treasury during the crisis . It is the profitability of the GSEs that has made them a target of the big banks . Obama is not interested in the homeownership rate , affordable housing , credit availability or even the America dream . What drives the policy is profits , that is , enhancing the profits of Obama 's primary constituents , the big banks . Wall Street has failed to kick-start the shadow banking system ( where MBS are traded ) because investors no longer trust the securities that banks ' produce . That 's why they need government backing ; it 's the only way they can entice investors into purchasing their toxic bonds .
Here 's Shahien Nasiripour and Arthur Delany at Huffington Post with more on Obama 's latest Wall Street giveaway :
“ Under Obama 's plan….The private sector would have to shoulder some of the initial losses if defaults were to rise , a condition usually triggered by falling home prices . After that , taxpayers would absorb the remainder of losses stemming from an extreme downturn in the nation 's property market… .. The cost of a taxpayer guarantee could be high… .. A senior administration official said that the cost of the current system , which helped lead to the financial crisis , was “ trillions and trillions of dollars in lost equity that we are still rebuilding. ” ( “ Obama 's Housing Plan : Government To Maintain Significant Role In Mortgages ” , Huffington Post )
So all the profits go to the banks , while 90 percent of the losses–which will surely amount to trillions of dollars–will be shrugged off onto working people . This is Obama 's housing finance reform plan in a nutshell . And do n't expect the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's new rule on “ Qualified Mortgage ” to prevent another catastrophe . The QM rule does not require a down payment or high credit scores . It also allows loans “ to be deemed qualified mortgages if borrowers are spending up to 43 % of their pretax income on monthly debt payments ” which is way too high . In other words , the loopholes in the CFPB 's qualified mortgage rule are big enough to drive a truck through . The banks would never issue a mortgage using these absurd underwriting standards , but their lawyers and lobbyists fought tooth and nail to make sure the standards were adopted by the CFPB . The reason for this is obvious ; the QM rule creates vast opportunities for abuse and fraud . Expect more predatory lending , more mass defaults , and another housing bubble .
Here 's more from the Dissembler in Chief :
“ Let 's make it easier for qualified buyers to buy homes they can . We should simplify overlapping regulations and cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage , but who keep getting rejected by banks . ”
Obama 's animus for regulation is typical of right wingers everywhere . What they mean when they say we need to “ cut red tape ” is that we should provide gov-insured loans to people with credit scores between 620 to 680 , in other words , subprime . Now it is possible to provide credit to people with poor credit scores if they are properly screened , but we already know from experience that the exploitative banks can not be trusted in this matter , so allowing them to issue gov-backed subprime loans is the fasttrack to disaster . But this is what Obama wants , because it beefs up Wall Street 's bottom line .
Obama also wants to expand existing government-sponsored mortgage modification programs ( HAMP , HARP ) to allow private label loans to be refinanced . The banks are currently sitting on over $ 1 trillion in non performing mortgages that they want to offload on Uncle Sam to clear their books . Most of these loans are worthless and , in many cases , the occupants of the homes have not made a mortgage payment in 2 or 3 years . Obama wants to shift responsibility for these private-label turkeys onto the government . This is not an attempt to “ save homeowners thousands of dollars a year by refinancing at today 's low rates ” as the president opines . It 's another bailout .
Dismantling Fannie and Freddie is a uniquely bad idea , just as government guarantees on pools of mortgages issued by proven fraudsters is a bad idea . Do we really need to reiterate that private capital–precipitated the crisis to begin with , or that Fannie and Freddie played a critical role in keeping the credit channel open after the banks had blown up the financial system and reduced the non agency residential securitization market to a smoldering pile of rubble ?
What do you think is going to happen next time , Mr Obama , when the next wave of crappy MBS start to default , but no one is there to break the fall because you had the two GSEs dragged to the glue factory ?
It 's worth mulling over , do n't you think ?

One of a writer 's biggest fears , unless they 're a tremendous asshole , is that what they make will end up doing more harm than good in the world . This fear is strongest when it comes to writing about and for marginalized communities . It 's easy to come at writing a character or storyline centered around the issues of marginalized groups with the best intentions and end up with a total mess . That potential outcome can leave creators wondering if it 's worth writing about those topics if they could end up just hurting people .
It 's important to talk about bad representation in order to answer that question , and it 's important to have an example of that to focus on . Maximum Fun 's The Adventure Zone , a roleplaying podcast hosted by the McElroy Brothers ( Justin , Travis , and Griffin , also behind the hit My Brother , My Brother and Me podcast ) and their father , just ended its first campaign a couple months ago . This show has grown to the point where the cast members now do live sessions across the country at different cons , dressed as their characters , and have a graphic novel adaptation on the way .
When the show first started , it was mainly just a way to fill time while on sabbatical from recording MBMBAM . Justin , one of the players , described the podcast as a “ car that flew all of a sudden ” when they talked about how they all realized that their goofy Dungeons and Dragons campaign filled with jokes about murder-boners was slowly becoming a legitimately compelling story . Suddenly , the campaign was not just their own narrative . It was becoming a journey that they shared with a diverse fanbase .
Griffin decided to introduce a lesbian couple in the third arc of the campaign : Sloane , the half-elf thief and battle-wagon racer who had been taken over by one of the campaign 's destructive Grand Relics , and Hurley , their halfling police officer partner who was ready to save them at any cost . At the arc 's conclusion , Hurley was fatally poisoned jumping through a thicket of thorns to rescue Sloane , and the thief sacrificed themselves to save her , conjoining and transforming the both of them into a cherry blossom tree .
It was a moving scene , but it also played into a history of one or both people in queer couples often being killed off in mass media . The potential survivor 's usually left to have their remorse over their lost love become their character arc . They exist as a queer person “ safe ” enough for the mainstream , one who never fully expresses themselves . That , or they 're left to be swept off their feet by a member of the opposite sex .
Griffin had n't intended this . On Twitter , when this was explained to him , they immediately owned up to a “ lack of mindfulness ” to explain how they had stumbled into the trope while also attempting to set up other parts of the overarching story . Intended or not , however , Griffin had added to this long history of gays being killed in media .
The power of poor representation is that it reaches out into real life and builds on an overwhelming culture of suppression . It misinforms , it disheartens , and it makes people bury down or disregard themselves out of fear of what will happen to them if they fit into how they 're depicted . Poor representation can help to build these predispositions into a force that weighs down on the marginalized . Just trying to exist can be withering when society sees you through certain stereotypes . So , Griffin 's depiction of a lesbian couple , like it or not , had caused harm .
What was the best way to respond to this ? The players and DM were four white cis hetero men . Justin had already decided that they would be playing their character , Taako the elf wizard , as a gay man . “ [ . . . ] I do n't know why , that was just how it always seemed to me. ” Would it have been better to avoid the subject and leave it for others to handle more carefully in the future ?
We start to get into questions of who gets to speak in creative fields here . Who has a voice , and who gets to share their stories ? It 's clear that there 's an ongoing problem with barriers in creative circles that keep marginalized groups from being able to tell their own narratives . Should white male creators keep out of telling these stories until this problem is solved ?
If the McElroys had decided to hold back from exploring LGBTQIA individuals further because of how Hurley and Sloane played out , they would have never gotten to provide a depiction of a lesbian couple that actually survived to the end of the story and had a presence throughout the campaign , through Killian the orc and Carey the dragonborn . The latter only appeared in the storyline in the arc directly after the one with Hurley and Sloane . Taako would most likely have never gotten a boyfriend in the form of the Grim Reaper , a relationship that also survived to the end of the game . ( That sounds like a metaphor , but … no , Taako dated the literal Grim Reaper . ) We would have probably never gotten a great depiction of a trans woman in the form of Lup , Taako 's sister , and the campaign definitely would not have ended with everyone coming together to celebrate Killian and Carey 's wedding in one of the happiest days of their lives .
When people who can speak and get a large audience hold back on putting representation in their stories for fear of unintended consequences , they still stumble into doing something unintentionally . There are other people out there who have that kind of voice who do n't want any depictions of marginalized groups at all , or at the very least want to tightly control how they can be shown . Taking on this “ do no harm ” philosophy cedes that control to entirely . It 's helping to perpetuate not just this oppressive specter of stereotyping and misinformation , but also another message for some marginalized groups : that they do n't even exist .
The damage that bad representation can cause should not be disregarded . However , opting for no representation in order to avoid bad representation is a terrible idea . People with privilege need to both clear the way for marginalized voices to create their own stories and help depict these groups as well . A perfectionist attitude helps nobody , because the fact is that people often make mistakes .
Mistakes , and bad representation with them , do n't have to remain as failures . They can be turned into forward movement . Griffin and the rest of the McElroys listened to the marginalized groups they were depicting and continue to listen to them for advice on how to move forward . That 's the important part . Dialogue and recognizing failure allows for writers who make these poor judgment calls to not only learn from their mistakes but to actually make the differences they want to make .
As for Hurley and Sloane … they 're brought back at the end of the campaign in a way that does n't feel like Griffin messily trying to undo their own mistake . There are consequences for what happened to them . They 've turned into dryads because of their near-death experience . It 's still new life for them , though … and they 're all the more glorious because of their scars .

Earlier this afternoon , Google officially unveiled Android Wear , its new platform for wearables . Now both Motorola and LG have announced Android Wear smartwatches .
Motorola , Google 's former-subsidiary apparently has big plans for Android Wear . It 's calling its watch the Moto 360 . The device is notable because it has a round face — something we have n't seen before in a smartwatch .
Like the Moto X , the Moto 360 is also designed to take advantage of gestures . Twisting a wrist will show an alert or your next meeting . On its blog , Motorola is hyping what it calls `` premium materials '' and says the Moto 360 will be available in a variety of styles .
LG 's first Android Wear smartwatch is appropriately dubbed the LG G Watch . Image : LG
LG is calling its device the LG G Watch and the company says it will be compatible with a variety of Android smartphones . LG says it expects to release the G Watch in the second quarter of 2014 — so we should see it in just a few months .
The company released a mockup image , which looks similar to some other smartwatches we 've seen — including Sony 's Android-powered SmartWatch 2 .
LG says it will release more details on the LG G Watch in the coming months .
The Moto 360 will be available in Summer 2014 , first in the United States and then in the rest of the world .
The world 's first death from a new strain of bird flu is sending ripples of concern through the medical community as experts debate whether the virus has the potential to cause a pandemic .
Chinese researchers reported in the Lancet on Tuesday that a 73-year-old Chinese woman died in December after contracting the new influenza A H10N8 virus . So far , only two cases have been reported in humans , and there is no indication it can to pass from human to human . But the scientists reported the virus in the 73-year-old woman was a mutated strain , meaning it could be learning to replicate more efficiently in humans .
The news is the latest in a string of high-profile reports about emerging avian flu strains and deaths related to seasonal flu that led to heightened demand and subsequent shortages of vaccines in some provinces .
Story continues below advertisement
But the truth , several experts on infectious diseases say , is that this year 's flu season is relatively normal and no one can predict what virus will lead to the next pandemic .
`` We , globally , still do n't know enough to say anything intelligent about a pandemic threat , '' said Allison McGeer , director of infection control at Toronto 's Mount Sinai Hospital .
The predominant strain in Canada this year is H1N1 , which caused a global pandemic in 2009 . The strain hits people under 65 particularly hard because they have not been exposed to it , unlike many seniors . Reports of numerous deaths of young people in Canada and the United States who contracted H1N1 created an unexpected flurry of demand for the flu shot across Canada .
Much of the concern has also centred on H7N9 , an avian flu virus that has led to nearly 300 cases in humans in China – 63 of them fatal . This week , the Public Health Agency of Canada told The Canadian Press it is monitoring the situation closely and updating its national pandemic preparedness plan . Last month , officials in Alberta said a woman in that province died after contracting the H5N1 avian flu in China – the first fatal case in North America .
One reason so many reports of different flu viruses are emerging is that countries like China have developed comprehensive surveillance systems to track problems and detect viruses as they emerge , Dr. McGeer said .
`` The harder you look , the more you 're going to find , '' they said .
John Spika , the Public Health Agency of Canada 's director-general for immunization and respiratory infectious diseases , said the reports of H10N8 represent `` no risk '' to Canadians . But they added that Canadians should be concerned about the flu every year , not just when new strains or deaths of young people are reported .

`` Ideally , you know , Canadians would be getting vaccinated at much higher rates every year , '' Dr. Spika said .
In Canada , 2,298 people had been hospitalized with influenza and 113 flu-related deaths had been reported as of Jan. 25 . The actual numbers are likely higher because not every case is tested and confirmed by a laboratory .
Every year , between 4,000 and 8,000 Canadians die of the flu . Dr. Spika said that , nationally , the flu season has peaked and numbers are slowly decreasing , although the eastern part of the country still has quite a few cases .

Good morning .
At 10am David Miranda is due to find out the result of their high court claim that their detention at Heathrow airport last August was unlawful and undermined their freedom of expression .
Miranda is the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald , who was one of the paper 's key team reporting the initial leaks from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden .
They were held and questioned for nine hours on Sunday 18 August 2013 under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 . In November their lawyers argued that their detention for the maximum period allowed was a misuse of schedule 7 and breached their human rights .
Steven Kovats QC , for the home secretary , said that if publication of material obtained by Snowden was capable of being an act of terrorism – and the home secretary “ submits that it is ” – then “ seeking to establish the nature of the claimant 's activity ” was both meeting the home secretary 's national security duty and discharging the police 's schedule 7 function “ of seeking to determine whether the claimant was or appeared to be a person who was or had been concerned in the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism ” .
Home Office lawyers also argued that border controls existed to check on travellers where there was insufficient information to justify an arrest .
Lord Justice Laws , Mr Justice Ouseley and Mr Justice Openshaw also heard arguments about what constitutes journalistic material under recent court precedents and whether all documents handed over would have specific protection . Lawyers for the Metropolitan police said they had “ legitimate ” concerns about how the encrypted material Miranda was carrying had been “ arranged ” as they feared all of the Snowden material could be released , endangering lives . Miranda 's lawyers argued that counter-terrorism powers under schedule 7 to the act should not have been used , insisted Miranda was not involved in terrorism and said that their right to freedom of expression was curtailed.Lord Justice Laws , Mr Justice Ouseley and Mr Justice Openshaw also heard arguments about what constitutes journalistic material under recent court precedents and whether all documents handed over would have specific protection .
Matthew Ryder QC , for Miranda , told the judges : This claim is about the use of counter-terrorism powers , that can only be used at ports and airports , to seize journalistic material . The “ dominant purpose ” of the examining officers was not to determine whether they were a person involved in the commission , instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism , but to “ assist the Security Service [ MI5 ] in accessing material in the claimant 's possession ” , Ryder said . This was also a “ disproportionate interference with their right to freedom of expression ” . I 'll cover the result live as it happens here . I 'll cover the result live as it happens here .
Miranda had nine items , including their laptop , mobile phone , memory cards and DVDs , taken from them while detained.He was stopped while changing planes on a journey from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro , where they live with Greenwald . In Berlin they were visiting Laura Poitras , a filmmaker who had also worked with the Guardian on the first Snowden revelations . Before their high court challenge in November , judges ruled that the material seized from them could only be examined for national security purposes and the protection of the public , and no other . Miranda 's legal action was against the home secretary and the commissioner of the Metropolitan police . At the high court , lawyers for the Home Office argued that schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act was “ surely also capable of covering the publication , or threatened publication , of stolen classified information which , if published , would reveal personal details of members of the armed forces or security and intelligence services thereby endangering their lives where that publication or threatened publication is designed to influence government policy on the activities of the security and intelligence agencies ” .
This week we 're launching the first-ever edition of Sensor Tower 's monthly Apple App Store non-gaming leader charts , based on the popularity of our ongoing iOS Gaming Leaders series . In this post , you 'll learn about November 2015 's top non-gaming apps by downloads , revenue , and fastest growth , with charts built using our industry-leading Store Intelligence estimates along with our expert analysis .
Keep reading to discover which apps topped the charts both in the U.S. and worldwide .
Top Downloads : PicPlayPost Publisher Makes a Splash with A cappella
Click the charts above to view larger versions .
Sensor Tower users who keep an eye on Top Charts & Leaders wo n't be surprised to see Facebook 's Messenger at the top of both U.S. and worldwide download charts—it 's held that spot almost since its release . In fact , many of the apps that comprise the U.S. top 10 have n't changed rank significantly from last month , but that 's not to say there were n't a couple of apps making sizable moves in November .
The biggest mover was A cappella from PicPlayPost , an a cappella music video editor initially launched by publisher Mixcord in September . The app was ranked No . 212 in terms of estimated U.S. downloads in October , but it surged in November , climbing 209 spots and becoming the third most downloaded overall ( it even managed to chart at No . 10 worldwide ) . You can see its corresponding performance on the U.S. App Store 's category rankings for all free apps on iPhone and iPad during November below , in a chart based on our App Intelligence ranking history data :
While it did n't experience quite the meteoric rise as A cappella , the month-over-month increase in downloads for Amazon 's flagship shopping app between October and November was significant enough to boost it 10 places to No . 9 overall for U.S. downloads . This was no doubt spurred by the traditional November kickoff of the holiday shopping season , as we previously analyzed in our look at Black Friday 's effect on iOS shopping app downloads . There , the Amazon app was the clear leader in terms of year-over-year growth , with downloads on the busiest U.S. shopping day of the year up 242 percent YoY .
Looking at all App Store territories , the big winner on the downloads front last month was China 's iQIYI , a video streaming app originally launched in fall 2010 . It grew by 139 percent between October and November , from 4.3 million downloads to more than 10.3 million . This translated into a No . 5 ranking on our top worldwide downloads chart , where it had ranked No . 16 the month prior .
Top Revenue : Netflix Makes Big Gains Through IAP
Click the charts above to view larger versions .
Three of the top 10 highest grossing apps for November both domestically and worldwide were dating-focused , while five were media streaming—either music or video . Spotify was solidly atop both charts , outgrossing second-place Pandora by more than $ 5 million in the U.S. and more than $ 12 million worldwide .
Tinder placed fifth on both charts as the revenue leader in dating apps , generating more than $ 2.7 million in the U.S. and more than $ 4.6 million worldwide .
Netflix was the real standout for November , however , nearly doubling its revenue from in-app purchases in the U.S. over October and growing it by more than 50 percent worldwide in the same period . This comes on the heels of the company enabling users to subscribe to its service from within its iOS app in September , and introducing a variety of subscription levels in the subsequent weeks .
To contrast , Netflix 's U.S. IAP revenue for October 2015 was approximately $ 715,000 , and this number climbed to approximately $ 1.8 million last month . Worldwide , its monthly revenue rose from about $ 990,000 to about $ 2.7 million over the same period . This translated to its app climbing 12 spots and entering the worldwide top revenue chart at No . 7 in November .
Note : The revenue estimates displayed on our charts are net amounts , i.e. , the amount paid to publishers by Apple after its 30 percent portion of their revenue has been deducted .
Fastest Growing by Downloads : Toca Boca Makes Growth Look Like Child 's Play
Having ranked No . 3 overall in terms of U.S. downloads , A cappella from PicPlayPost was also the fastest growing app in terms of month-over-month downloads between October and November in the U.S. , growing by more than 28,000 percent during the period . Media making apps Cinepic and Giffage also witnessed impressive growth , with Condé Nast 's Thanksgiving : A Bon Appétit Manual no doubt receiving a surge in downloads courtesy of the U.S. holiday .
Both worldwide and domestically , it was Stockholm , Sweden-based Toca Boca AB that made the biggest single-company impact on the fastest growing chart with three titles represented .

There are dating sites for everyone these days . One of the more obscure ones is Awake Dating , a new site exclusively for conspiracy theorists .
It 's for people who have `` woken '' ( not to be confused with `` woke , '' which usually describes people who are aware of social justice issues ) . Those who are `` awake '' believe that the world 's leaders or other secretive organizations are responsible for what happens in the world , according to Jarrod Fidden , the site 's COO .
Instead of using the term `` conspiracy theorist , '' which is often `` employed to discredit and ridicule , '' Fidden prefers the term `` early adopter of inconvenient truths . ''
`` My wife and I were lucky to 'wake up ' together some two odd years ago , '' they write in an email . `` To find an awake partner to share your interests with — That is a true blessing . So Awake Dating was born as a premium platform for discussion , networking , and meeting others who share their interests and view of 'reality . ' ''
Awake Dating appears to be a legitimate dating site . It 's actually not even the first one of its kind ; there 's also `` Dating Freedom Lovers '' and `` Paranormal Date . ''
The beta version of Awake Dating launched on April 13 , followed by a series of short YouTube ads . The one below features a series of people in tinfoil hats holding hands . `` If you thought it was impossible to meet someone , awake dot dating is here for you , '' a voice sings in a jingle . `` Matching all kinds of people is what we do . ''
When you go to the home page , it looks like any other dating site , except for some weirdly ominous images . In under two months , it has attracted over 1,200 sign-ups .
Awake Dating
After members join , `` the administration '' sends a message that reads , `` We are welcoming you to our website . Hope you will find it pleasant to work with . ''
Members can personalize their backgrounds , so I chose monkeys . People can also specify if they 're looking for a date or a friend . And they can choose an array of interests , including `` loud keyboards , '' `` the illusion of 'money , ' '' and `` This is outrageous , the earth is not only flat but void of others lol . ''
Awake Dating
When you click `` People '' at the top , you can browse through all of the site 's members with the option to filter by location , gender , or interest .
One member writes that they are interested in `` human beings who 'get it . ' ''
Another writes , `` 10 or 20 years ago , I would have considered myself closer to normal — but these days ? Any who , I 'm 46 years old , divorced , not terrible looking , Libertarian , and more or less on the fringe politically . ''
The people on Awake Dating tend to be older than 35 , and there seem to be a lot more men than women . Many describe themselves as misfits or `` misunderstood . ''
Awake Dating
By the end of May , Fidden plans to launch an Indiegogo campaign , which will allow members to continue using Awake Dating for free . If they raise enough money , they will also launch the `` 3D City '' feature , a virtual environment where members ' avatars can meet and chat .
Fidden imagines the site as a judgment-free zone for people who hold non-mainstream beliefs . The world can seem like a lonely place for conspiracy theorists , they say .
But with a little help from Awake Dating , truthers and theorists can be their real selves — and maybe even find true love .
DARWIN ( Reuters ) - U.S. Marines began arriving in Australia 's tropical north on Tuesday for a six-month deployment during which they will conduct exercises with Australian and visiting Chinese forces .

The 25-year annual deployment program started by former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2011 is part of the U.S. “ pivot ” to Asia at a time of increased assertiveness by China .
“ I think that the commitment that we 've taken to put a task force here with a conversation to get larger over the years says that we do think this is an important region , ” said Marines ' commander Lieutenant Colonel Brian Middleton after the first troops arrived in Darwin in the Northern Territory .
“ Being close to Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean , the Indo Pacific position has always been important . ”
Middleton said the marines would conduct an “ important exercise alongside our Chinese partners ” and Australia .
The strength of this year 's deployment at 1,250 troops lags well behind the initial plan for the deployment to reach 2,500 Marines this year , but it will see the largest U.S. aircraft contingent to Australia in peacetime history .
Middleton said the 13 aircraft , including tilt-rotor Ospreys , Super Cobra helicopters and Huey helicopters , triple the four aircraft in past deployments , was a “ tangible kind of sign of our commitment to the region and to this partnership ” .
They said the decision to send the aircraft pre-dated the recent escalation in tensions over North Korea .
“ Regardless , I think it is just a good move any time we can strengthen the long standing partnership and alliance between our two countries . We stand ready to fight and win the night always . ”
U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group to sail to near the Korean peninsula as a show of force aimed at deterring North Korea from conducting more missiles tests . Pyongyang launched a failed missile test on Sunday and has warned Washington against taking military action against North Korea .
The Australia-US-China military exercises are also aimed at Australia charting a course between its most important security ally the United States and its biggest trading partner China .
Australia has drawn rebukes from both superpowers as it tries to strike a balanced stance on the disputed South China Sea , with China criticizing Australian freedom-of-navigation flights in the area and a senior U.S. soldier calling on Australia to do more there .
One hears a certain baleful cry regularly in writerly circles that Americans do n't care about poetry anymore . A widely read Atlantic piece by Dana Gioia in 1992 was a signature statement . Granted , that was a while ago now , but times do n't seem to have changed much : Comments in the wake of Charles Wright 's anointment last week as America 's poet laureate kept the lamentation going .
The drill goes that back in the day , kids recited Longfellow in school , but today poets are a tiny guild writing largely for one another . Americans , anti-intellectual and numb to the artistic as always , have become a people deaf to heightened renditions of their language .
It sounds right . I myself a long time ago even threw my hat in on the subject . But the whole notion is , in fact , nonsense .
To utterly naïve anthropologists sent to document the ways of Americans in 2014 , one of the first things that would strike them is that this country is quite poetry mad . No , they would not find well-thumbed volumes of Robert Frost , Marianne Moore , and Billy Collins laying around the typical living room . However , they could not help but notice that a great many people under about 50 regularly go around listening to and yes , reciting poetry—rap , that is .
Rap is indeed “ real ” poetry . It rhymes , often even internally . Its authors work hard on the lyrics . The subject matter is certainly artistically heightened , occasioning long-standing debates over whether the depictions of violence and misogyny in some of it are sincere . And then , that “ gangsta ” style is just one , and less dominant than it once was . Rap , considered as a literature rather than its top-selling hits , addresses a wide-range of topics , even including science fiction . Rap is now decades old , having evolved over time and being increasingly curated by experts . In what sense is this not a “ real ” anything ?
The only reason rap may seem to nevertheless not be “ real ” poetry is a skewed take on language typical of modern , literate societies : that spoken language is merely a sloppy version of written language . “ English , ” under this analysis , is what 's on a page , with punctuation and fonts and whoms and such . Speech is “ just talking . ”
That means that to us , poetry is written poetry , that which sits between covers and is intended to be read , quietly , alone , with tea , likely chamomile . Never mind that in fact Jay-Z has released a magisterial volume of their lyrics as a book : generally , rap is intended to be heard on the fly , often in a concert arena . Surely there is a key distinction between that and the strophes of John Berryman or Gwendolyn Brooks ?
But if there is , it 's a matter of style and tone , not basic classification . Partly because of its orality and partly because it is so relentlessly “ of our times , ” rap tends to be profane—but profanity does not disqualify something as poetry . One might not like poetry laced with profanity—but that 's something different , and quite frankly most of the young America likes it just fine , just crazy about the poetry they have grown up with .
Overall the idea that poetry is serious only if it 's on a page and read with tea is actually rather parochial . An epic like Beowulf was composed for the ear , with careful alliterations within each line . Somalians ' poetry , again , written down only as an afterthought by outside observers , has such intricate rules that to us it seems more like a puzzle than art . Spoken is not broken .
America , then , has no real interest in written poetry . And it 's certainly true that old timers were taught to recite “ Casey at the Bat ” in school , that Edna St. Vincent Millay had a national radio show for a while , that the culturally aspiring twenty-something once often had Louis Untermeyer 's poetry anthology on their bookshelf , that Marianne Moore did some appearances on the “ Tonight Show . ”
Today , okay , Billy Collins has achieved a kind of household status if NPR-listening , New Yorker-reading people count as “ household. ” But their embrace by the collegetown crowd is something different from the old days when newspapers regularly solicited light poetry just to fill empty spaces on pages .
The real story is that modern technology and social media make us a much more oral society than we once were . Naturally poetry will be delivered more through the ear than through the eye—just as it was for most of human history , and still is in most of the world 's 6,000 languages , only about a hundred of which are written in any real way .
And it does n't help that modern poetry is often intentionally something other than comfort food . Without rhyme or regular meter , embracing ambiguity and often deeply individualistic , much of it almost willfully transcends the bounds of popular taste . Lamenting that America does n't cherish poetry like this is like wondering why Milton Babbitt , Thomas Pynchon and Ornette Coleman are n't common coin .
Overall , today 's young person can often recite just as much poetry as their grandfather could , and likely spends a lot more of their spare time engaging it—only with earbuds on rather than with their hands around a mug of tea on a rainy afternoon . “ And every fair from fair sometimes declines , ” Shakespeare once told us , but when it comes to poetry , it would appear that America 's “ eternal summer shall not fade ” after all .

Ryanair says the £6 charge per passenger per one-way flight relates to costs associated with its booking system , and is n't a payments surcharge
Ryanair has defied the government 's move to ban surcharges on payments to airlines and other firms by saying it does not charge its passengers any credit or debit card fees .
Airlines , cinemas and holiday firms will be stopped from imposing millions of pounds in `` hidden last-minute '' charges on internet bookings . Treasury minister Mark Hoban said the government is prepared to legislate to prevent airlines and other businesses from imposing hefty charges on credit and debit card bookings that are difficult to detect .
However , the budget airline said in a statement : `` Ryanair , the UK 's favourite airline , today confirms that it does not impose any debit or credit card fees . ''
Ryanair claims instead to charge an `` admin fee '' per passenger per one-way flight . This £6 charge is levied when a passenger comes to pay and can only be avoided by using the airline 's own prepaid Mastercard . It states on its website that this charge `` relates to costs associated with Ryanair 's booking system . ''
The charge means that , for example , a group of 14 people travelling together would pay £168 extra for their flights , despite the fact that only one payment is processed for the entire group .
John Holmes , principal economist at Which ? , who helped compile a report into excessive card charges which formed the basis of a supercomplaint to the Office of Fair Trading earlier this year , said the Ryanair reaction was typical of the airline and would be dismissed by the government .
`` The only time the airline charges that £6 admin fee is when a passenger presents a payment method to the airline , '' they said . `` The principle of this government legislation is about those charges that are practically unavoidable . You can not avoid paying for a flight so you can not avoid the charge . ''
Which ? says an airline incurs costs of between 8p-20p on debit card transactions . Those rise to between 0.88 % and 1.8 % of the transaction for payments by credit card . It means a passenger paying the average return fare of £136.09 should pay a minimum of £1.20 and a maximum of £2.45 for a credit card booking .
In June 2011 the OFT called on the government to ban debit card surcharges , but said companies could still impose credit card transaction fees as they are more costly to process , provided they meet minimum transparency requirements .
However , the Treasury has taken this a step further and decided to ban `` excessive surcharges '' on credit and debit cards by most `` retail sectors '' . Ministers could have opened themselves up to a judicial review if they had just targeted airlines . The ban is to be imposed from the end of 2012 .
The ruling will put the UK ahead of many other EU countries , all of which would have to ban the same fees from 2014 under the Consumer Rights Directive .
However , it does not stop retailers imposing other charges . Ryanair charges 15 different types of fee , including those for reserved seating , priority boarding and reissuing airport boarding cards , while ticketing agency Ticketmaster charges a service charge and order processing fee for tickets to sporting events and concerts .
Government agencies , including the DVLA , will be allowed to continue charging card fees . The DVLA has a £2.50 credit card charge for anyone renewing their tax disc .
`` This ruling is trying to tackle excessive surcharges . My understanding is that the DVLA charge only covers costs , '' a Treasury spokesperson said .
Mark Hoban added : `` We want consumers to be able to shop around . They have a right to understand the charges they may incur up front and not be hit through a hidden last-minute payment surcharge .
`` We are leading the way in Europe by stopping this practice . The government remains committed to helping consumers get a good deal in these difficult times . ''
Which ? executive director Richard Lloyd said : `` The government 's decision to ban 'rip-off ' debit and credit card surcharges is a huge victory for consumers . Given that airline passengers alone pay more than £265,000 a day in card surcharges , businesses should n't drag their feet over this . While the law will come into force at the end of 2012 , we want companies to be upfront and fair over card charges today . ''
Melanie Johnson , chair of The UK Cards Association , the service company for the UK payments industry , said : `` This is a terrific Christmas gift for consumers . The UK Cards Association fully supported Which ? and the OFT on this issue and we are delighted the Treasury has decided to bring into line those few businesses who continue excessively charging us all for using our cards .
`` The charges in no way reflect the true costs of processing the transaction , are rarely up front , and could not be justified '' .
John Joyce had a tough time holding back tears Monday afternoon at a used car dealership in Pinellas Park , Florida , as their friend and longtime customer handed them the keys to their new truck .
“ It was wonderful , really wonderful , ” they tell PEOPLE exclusively of their 2004 Nissan truck .
Joyce , 83 , has spent the last few months walking several miles a day to their customers ' homes to mow their lawns after the transmission died in their 1994 truck .
Longtime customer Robert Norton and their wife Nikki Norton created a GoFundMe account hoping to help Joyce .
They were stunned when people donated more than $ 13,000 in just a few weeks and they were able to give them the new ride .
From left : Nikki Norton , Robert Norton and John Joyce Dion Lim
“ He was amazed too , they could n't believe it . They looked like they were ready to start crying , and then I started crying , ” Robert says .
A used car dealer sold them the truck at cost , leaving money left over to pay for the insurance , plates and to get Joyce a Home Depot gift certificate for a new lawnmower .
“ It was super exhilarating to do a good thing for such a good man . I 'm at a loss of words . I 've been through a whirlwind of ups and downs the last few weeks and it 's nice to culminate on a feel good moment , ” Robert added .
Robert lost their mom just a few days before their wedding last week . They and their new wife , Nikki , got back from their honeymoon Saturday and made all the arrangements for Joyce 's truck the next day , handing them the keys less than 48 hours after returning home .
“ People 's needs do n't arise when it 's convenient for you , they arise when they have needs . John 's needs did n't come at a convenient time , but we needed to help him . I did n't want them to have to wait , ” they say .
Sure enough , Joyce did n't wait to get back to work . They drove off the lot with plans to get right back to mowing lawns .
“ I think it 's wonderful , ” they say . “ There could n't be anything better . ”

Uh… Are n't the people they are referring to Muslims ? Why was they avoiding that fact , instead calling them asylum seekers . Is it Political Correctness , or fear of being arrested for saying the truth ?
Sweden dug its own grave because of Political Correctness and so-called Progressiveness . Now it is falling apart because no one really wants to stand out and have a differing opinion that does n't fit the PC mode .
Hopefully , Baby Doc ( Son of Fuddle-Duddle ) Trudeau will wake up in time . But I would seriously not hold my breath .
BTW , stories have been popping up where these economic migrants/foreign freeloaders have been placed in Canada . Schools , pools , malls , reporting attacks upon mostly young teen girls . Just great . Also carefully worded articles trying to hide the background of the attackers , this by our PC media . It 's enough to make you want to buy an island and arm yourself , but we wo n't be allowed to protect ourselves very soon . And the Liberals want to pass a bill specifically outlawing criticism of Islam .

The John Batchelor Show , February 14 .
Nation Contributing Editor Stephen F. Cohen and John Batchelor continue their weekly discussions of the new US-Russian Cold War . ( Previous installments , now in their fourth year , are at TheNation.com . )
Cohen regrets the subject of tonight 's discussion . They prefer to focus their decades of scholarly study and personal experience on loftier developments in Russia and issues in US-Russian relations . But the bipartisan , nearly full-political-spectrum tsunami of allegations that President Trump has been seditiously “ compromised ” by the Kremlin ( Thomas Friedman , New York Times , February 15 ) , with scarcely any non-partisan pushback at any influential political or media levels—and without any yet verified facts—is deeply alarming . Begun by the Clinton campaign in mid 2016 , and exemplified now by the strident innuendos of MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow and equally unbalanced bookings at CNN and elsewhere , the practice is growing into a kind of latter-day McCarthyite red-baiting and hysteria . Such politically malignant practices are to be deplored anywhere they appear , without exception , whether on the part of conservatives or liberals or progressives . They are driven by political forces with various agendas : the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party that wants to maintain its grip on the party in its internal struggle ahead by insisting they did not lose the election but it was stolen by Russian President Putin for Trump ; by enemies of Trump 's proposed détente with Russia , who want to discredit both them and Putin ; by Republicans and Democrats outraged that Trump essentially ran and won without either party , thereby threatening the established two-party system , etc . Whatever the motivating factors , the ensuing slurring of Trump , which is already producing calls for their impeachment , poses grave threats to US and international security and to American democracy itself . Ready to Fight Back ? Sign Up For Take Action Now
Cohen does not deny that one or more of the allegations against Trump may be true , as might be almost anything in modern-day political history . Instead , they insist that no verified facts have actually been presented for the allegations . And without facts , all of us—professors , politicians , doctors , journalists—are doomed to malpractice or worse . ( Though Cohen welcomes an impartial and independent investigation to search for such facts , which would then be evaluated objectively , they doubt one is possible in the current political atmosphere . )
Meanwhile , Cohen can find no facts or logic to support the following six related allegations leveled against Trump as having been ( implicitly ) treasonously “ compromised ” by Putin 's Kremlin :
1 . Trump has “ lavished praise ” on Putin ( New York Times , February 12 ) . All Trump has said in this regard is that Putin is “ a strong leader ” and “ smart ” and that it would be good “ to cooperate with Russia. ” These are empirically true statements . They pale in comparison with , for example , the warm words of FDR about Stalin , Nixon about Brezhnev , and particularly President Clinton about Russian President Boris Yeltsin , whom they compared favorably with George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , and FDR . Only against the backdrop of unrelenting US media demonizing of Putin could Trump 's “ praise ” be considered “ lavish. ” Unlike virtually every other mainstream American politician and media outlet , Trump simply refused to vilify Putin—as in declining to characterize them as “ a killer , ” for which there is also no evidence .
2 . Trump and their associates have had , it is charged , business dealings in Russia and with Russian “ oligarchs. ” Perhaps , but so have many major American energy and mineral extraction corporations , Delta Air Lines , McDonald 's , Wendy 's , KFC , and Starbucks . Their Russian partners are often “ oligarchs. ” Moreover , unlike many international hotel corporations , Trump tried but failed to build his , or anything else permanent , in Russia . The “ Russian assets ” about which their son spoke seem to be from selling condos and coops in the United States to cash-bearing Russians in search of a luxury brand , but not a mortgage , New York City and South Florida being prime and entirely legitimate examples . It is said that Trump 's tax returns , if revealed , would expose nefarious Russian money . Considering the financial documents of ownership they have made public , that seems unlikely . Perhaps—but also an allegation , not a fact .
3 . Trump 's “ associate , ” and briefly campaign manager , Paul Manafort , is alleged to have been “ pro-Russian ” when they advised Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych , who was subsequently deposed unconstitutionally during the Maidan “ revolution ” in February 2014 . This makes no sense . A professional political expert , Manafort was well paid , like other American electoral experts hired abroad . But their advice seems to have been to urge Yanukovych to tilt toward the ill-fated European Union Partnership Agreement , away from Russia , as Yanukovych did , in order to get votes in Ukraine beyond their constituency in Southeastern regions . ( Nor was Yanukovych , whom Putin loathed for this and other reasons , considered pro-Russian in Moscow prior to late 2013 , or presumably Manafort either . )
4 . A “ dossier ” of “ black ” or “ compromising ” material purporting to document how the Kremlin could blackmail Trump was leaked to CNN and published by Buzzfeed . Compiled by a former British intelligence official , whose shadowy partners in Russia and perhaps Ukraine abetted their commercial projects , the “ report ” was initially contracted by one of Trump 's primary opponents , apparently Senator Marco Rubio , and then paid for by the Clinton campaign . Its 30-odd pages are a compilation of the entirely innocent , unverified , preposterous , and trash for sale in many political capitals , including Moscow . More recently , CNN exclaimed that its own intelligence leakers had “ confirmed ” some elements of the dossier , but thus far nothing that actually compromised Trump . Generally , more fact checking is done at tabloid magazines , lest they be sued for libel . ( Nonetheless , it is reported that Senator John McCain , a rabid opponent of any détente with Russia , gave a copy of the dossier to the FBI . No doubt the agency already had copies , rumors of which had been floating around for months , but understood McCain wanted it leaked , as eventually it was by someone . )
5 . But the crux of pro-Kremlin allegations against Trump was , and remains , the charge that Putin hacked the DNC and disseminated the stolen e-mails through WikiLeaks in order to put Trump in the White House . A summary of these “ facts ” was presented in a declassified report released by the “ intelligence community ” and widely published in January 2017 . Though it has since become axiomatic proof for Trump 's political and media enemies , virtually nothing in the report 's some 13 pages of text is persuasive . About half the pages are assumptions—or “ assessments ” —based on surmised motivations , not factual evidence of a Russian operation on behalf of Trump . The other half is merely an outdated evaluation deploring broadcasts by the Kremlin-funded television network RT , at worst a run-of-the-mill “ propaganda ” outlet . ( Some viewers think that its Washington bureau , staffed by many Americans , favored Bernie Sanders , not Trump . ) Moreover , a number of American hacking experts insist that Russian state hackers would have left no fingerprints , as US intelligence claimed they had . Indeed , the group Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity believes that the damaging DNC documents were not hacked but leaked by an insider . If so , it had nothing to do with Russia at all . ( The NSA , which has the capacity to monitor the movement of e-mails , was only “ moderately confident ” in the report it co-signed , while the CIA and the FBI were “ highly confident. ” ) Still more , at their final presidential press conference , Obama referred to the DNC scandal as a leak , not a hack , and said they did not know how the e-mails got to WikiLeaks—this despite the allegations by their own intelligence agencies . ( No one seems to have asked Obama if they misspoke ! ) On the other side of this alleged conspiracy , nor is it clear that Putin so favored the erratic Trump that they would have taken such a risk , which if discovered would presumably have compromised Trump and greatly favored Clinton . Judging from discussions in Kremlin-related Russian newspapers , there was a serious debate as to which American presidential candidate might be best—or least bad—for Russia .
6 . Finally , there is the resignation ( or firing ) of General Michael Flynn as Trump 's national security adviser for having communicated with Russian representatives about the sanctions imposed by Obama just before leaving the White House and before Trump was inaugurated . Flynn may have misled Vice President Mike Pence about those discussions , but they were neither unprecedented nor incriminating , so far as is known . Other American presidential candidates and presidents-elect had communicated with foreign states—as Nixon seems to have done to prevent a Vietnam peace agreement that would favor Humphrey , or perhaps as Reagan did with Iran to prevent release of its American hostages before the election . Indeed , it seems to have been a common practice . For example , Obama 's own subsequent top Russia adviser , Michael McFaul , told The Washington Post recently ( February 9 ) that they visited Moscow in 2008 , before the election , for talks with Russian officials . The Post reporter characterized this as “ appropriate conduct. ” Certainly , it was not unprecedented . Nor was Flynn 's , it seems , though perhaps inept . More generally , if Flynn 's purpose was to persuade the Kremlin not to overreact to Obama 's sanctions , which were accompanied by a provocative threat to launch a cyberattack on Moscow , this seems wise and in America 's best interests . Unless our political-media establishment would prefer the harshest possible reaction by Putin , as some of its Cold War advocates apparently do .
In concluding , Cohen suggests that it is less Putin who is threatening American democracy than is the Kremlin-bating of President Trump—unless facts can be produced for its allegations . Less Putin who is endangering US and international security than the American enemies of détente who resort to such tactics . Less Putin who is degrading US media with “ fake news ” —unless facts are presented to support the mainstream media allegations against Trump regarding Russia . And less the “ former KGB thug Putin ” who is poisoning American politics than the US intelligence leakers who are at war against their new president .
President Eisenhower eventually stopped Joseph McCarthy . Who , Cohen asks , will stop the new McCarthyism before it spreads even more into the professed “ soul of democracy ” ? Facts might do so . But in lieu of facts there are only professional ethics and patriotism .
ECMWF The European model now predicts Hurricane Matthew WILL hit Florida as a Category 4 storm
The latest projection from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts agrees with most US models that the gigantic , slow-moving hurricane will reach Haiti at around 2am on Tuesday . But unlike other forecasts the new ECMWF high probability cluster now shows ALL likely paths of the storm then hitting Florida , before moving north and hugging the south eastern coast of the United States . And a second UK forecast just issued , from the Met Office , agrees a direct hit on Florida later this week is now the most likely scenario . It shows the storm turning west after it passes Cuba , before making landfall near Orlando .
UK Met Office The hurricane will hit Florida , warns this UK Met Office forecast model
The killer Hurricane is currently rolling north through the Caribbean at just 6MPH having already claimed the lives of three people in Haiti .
The southern party of the country was also cut off from the rest of it after a key bridge which was lashed by Hurricane Matthew collapsed . Category 4 Matthew , one of the worst storms to hit the region since 2007 , is unusual in having weakened only slightly over the past five days as it continued on its deadly path through Central America . America 's National Hurricane Centre has warned Florida and the rest of the east coast to be prepared for possible impact by the end of the week and US officials have said they are not ruling out a “ catastrophic ” event .
A spokesperson said : “ The cyclone is expected to move in a general northward direction for the next 48 hours or so .
“ After clearing the northeastern coast of Cuba , Matthew is expected to turn toward the north-northwest within southeasterly flow between the western periphery of a strong ridge located over the southwestern Atlantic and a weak mid- to upper-level trough currently located over the eastern Gulf of Mexico .
ABC Hurricane Matthew is set to hit the US coast on Thursday
They added : `` Although the official forecast continues to show a track east of Florida , it is still too soon to rule out possible hurricane impacts there .
“ It is also too soon to know whether , or how , Matthew might affect the remainder of the United States east coast. ” Forecasters said as much as 40 inches of rain could fall on some isolated areas of Haiti , raising fears of deadly mudslides and floods in the heavily deforested country where many families live in flimsy houses with corrugated metal roofs .
`` Some of us will die but I pray it wo n't be a lot , '' said Serge Barionette in the southern town of Gressier , where a river recurrently bursts its banks during serious storms .
This storm is catastrophic , and if it hits our state , we could see impacts that we have not seen in many years Florida Governor Rick Scott on Hurricane Matthew
Florida Governor Rick Scott said : `` This is a serious and life threatening storm . I have spoken with county emergency management officials who are working in our local communities to ensure our state is prepared for the potential impacts of this major hurricane . This storm is catastrophic , and if it hits our state , we could see impacts that we have not seen in many years . Even though the storm 's projected path is just east of our state , no one should take this lightly . `` Storms change fast and Hurricane Matthew could hit Florida as early as Wednesday . `` At this time , there have been no evacuations ordered in Florida , but that could change quickly . Please stay alert . Make sure to have three days of food and water , flashlights , batteries and a battery powered radio . ”
More than a million people have also been told to leave their homes as Hurricane Matthew heads towards the US state of South Carolina . State Governor Nikki Haley tonight declared a state of emergency ordered the mass evacuation of people in coastal areas .
Florida and Georgia have also announced states of emergency for the violent storm which has already wreaked havoc in the Caribbean with 145mph winds and surging seas .

Matthew hit category-5 status at the end of last week making it the strongest hurricane to sweep the Atlantic since Hurricane Dean in 2007 .
Hurricane warnings are currently in place across the Caribbean with Jamaica preparing for the worst attack since 1988 's Hurricane Gilbert .
Gilbert was the most powerful storm ever to hit the Atlantic basin until it was eclipsed by Hurricane Wilma in 2005 .
Haiti , Jamaica , the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba are currently braced for devastating winds and floods from more than two feet of rainwater .
Families are being urged to stock up on food and water while emergency services plan to evacuate high-risk areas .
Hundreds of emergency shelters have been put up in southern Haiti with experts warning of flash floods and mudslides .

NOAA Hurricane Matthew 's clear eye as the storm moved through the south central Caribbean Sea
Jamaica 's Prime Minister Andrew Holness said : “ The impact of [ Matthew ] will probably be similar or greater than Hurricane Gilbert , but our preparedness would be far better . ”
After moving through Haiti and Jamaica over the next 12 hours it is expected to hit Cuba tomorrow with the US Guantanamo Bay Navy base in the firing line with more than 5,000 being forced to leave including 700 civilians and 61 men held at the detention centre . Matthew has already claimed the lives of two people - a 67-year-old man who was swept away by a stream in Uribia , Colombia and a 16-year-old boy crushed by a boulder on the island of St. Vincent , west of Barbados .
Weather experts say even if Matthew misses a direct collision with America it threatens dangerous coastal flooding and beach erosion .
They are keeping an eye on the track of the storm which will depend on high-atmosphere air pressure and the jet stream .
A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said : “ Forecast guidance suggests we ca n't rule out at least tropical storm-force winds along the eastern Florida coast in the Thursday-Friday timeframe . “ What will ultimately determine how close Matthew comes to at least the southeast U.S. coast involves the timing and strength of upper-level high pressure along the East giving way to a southward dip in the jet stream .
Defending Kant 's Classical Liberalism
Because they are widely regarded as a strict and demanding moralist , and because their political philosophy is not as well-known as their ethics , Immanuel Kant is not as frequently mentioned as a classical liberal as are John Stuart Mill , Adam Smith , and Friedrich Hayek . In this essay , I will argue that they should be , based on a survey of their views of the moral roles of the individual and the state . First , I will explain that the portrayal of Kant 's ethics as cold and rigid is a caricature ( much though not all of it due to Ayn Rand ) , when in fact they represent a commonsense morality , grounded in the dignity of the individual , with a surprising degree of flexibility . Then I will discuss Kant 's view of government , which represents the classical liberal ideal : a minimal state restricted to protecting individuals from wrongful interference from each other and the state , allowing them to pursue their ends with maximal liberty and freedom .
Kant 's Focus on the Individual
The starting point for Kant 's ethics is autonomy . [ 1 ] According to Kant , autonomy is the ability to make moral choices without undue regard or deference to either external authority or internal inclinations . Each of us should decide what to do in ethically fraught situations according to our own moral code , not what the government , church , or community tell us to do—unless we agree independently that it is the right thing to do . ( For someone living under a dictatorship , as well a powerful church to which they belonged , Kant 's stance reflects well on their courage . ) We should likewise not act merely according to our personal preferences or desires , which may pull us in directions opposed to our sense of morality . Both of these conditions ensure that our moral choices align with what we believe to be the right thing to do in our personal conception of what morality demands , in the sense of self-government that the term autonomy implies . To Kant , autonomy is not only an ability but also a responsibility , specifically to live up to our own moral standards without deferring to anybody else 's desires—or to our own .
Of course , no one exercises their autonomy perfectly all the time—none of us is perfectly moral , rational , or strong-willed . Nonetheless , based on our capacity for autonomous choice , every person is imbued with dignity , an unconditional , incalculable , and incomparable worth that not only distinguishes persons from things but also renders each person of equivalent moral value with every other . Again , given the rigidly hierarchical social structures at the time , the concept of the moral equality of all persons that Kant endorsed was very progressive , even if Kant themselves did not live up to it in all of their personal opinions .
The autonomy and resulting dignity of each person is the basis for Kant 's categorical imperative , the bane of introductory philosophy students everywhere . There is no need for me to rehearse the details here , but I will mention several aspects of the procedure that generates moral duty . Perhaps the best-known version of the categorical imperative involves universalization : we should act on those plans of action or maxims that we could rationally will everyone follows . While this seems to be an empty exercise in logic—and a notoriously difficult one to put into practice—the reason why we universalize is inherently normative . Because all persons have dignity , we can not allow ourselves moral license that we could not and would not extend to everybody else . Because no one is more special or worthy than anyone else , we must hold ourselves to the same standards to which we hold others , which is guaranteed by the thought exercise of universalizing our maxims .
The other well-known version of the categorical imperative puts dignity front and center : we must never treat other persons ( or ourselves ) merely as means to our ends , but always at the same time as valuable ends in themselves . This statement embodies Kant 's distinction between persons and things : things ( which lack dignity ) may be used simply as means to our ends , but persons ( which possess dignity ) can not . This is not to say that we can never use other persons for own ends , but only that we must do so with respect . I use my local baristas to get my coffee fix in the morning , but I am polite ( and , on a good day , even charming ) and I readily exchange my money according to the terms laid out on the menu . I do not cheat , lie , or force my baristas to give me coffee , as coercion and deceit are the primary ways to treat a person merely as means . Of course , this goes the other way also : my baristas ( or their employer ) use me to earn wages ( or profits ) , but they do so by offering to sell me a product I like ( or I will go elsewhere for it ) .
Kant wrote that their categorical imperative was nothing but a formalization of the moral intuitions of the common person on the street : treat everyone the same and , if you need their cooperation , convince them to work with you , rather than lying or forcing them to . This is the social context of mutual and reciprocal respect that Kantian ethics requires , and it is very much in line with classical liberal thought .
Defying the Caricature of Kant as a Rigid Moralist
Much of the reason Kant is not widely acknowledged as a classical liberal may be that the duties they promote seem rigid and demanding . Ayn Rand is well known for accusing Kant for demanding extreme altruism ; not only is this is a misunderstanding of Kant 's views of beneficence , but of the nature of moral duties in general in the Kantian paradigm .
In short , the categorical imperative generates two types of duties . Perfect duties , also called strict duties , allow for no exceptions in one 's own interests , and are normally negative in nature : do not lie , do not steal , do not kill , and so forth . Imperfect duties , or wide duties , do allow for exceptions or latitude because they do not demand certain actions ( or abstention from certain actions ) , but only lay out attitudes that must be maintained and acted on when possible . ( In this sense , they resemble how virtue ethicists conceive of virtues and virtuous action ; this is no accident , and indeed imperfect duties are often called duties of virtue . [ 2 ] ) Accordingly , these duties are normally positive in nature : help others , cultivate your talents , and so forth .
If any Kantian duties are rigid , perfect duties are . But note that these duties prevent us from taking actions that fail to respect the dignity of other persons , speaking both directly ( in terms of personal impact ) and indirectly ( by carving out personal exceptions and thereby treating other person as being of lesser worth ) , so their rigidity is in service of basic classical liberal principles of noninterference . By contrast , imperfect duties are hardly rigid—quite the opposite , as they allow us to choose when and how to act on them . We need not help everyone we possibly can ; we should take into account our other duties and responsibilities as well , including those to ourselves , as persons with dignity equivalent to all others .
Kant was very clear about the limited nature of duties of beneficence , saying for instance that we should never give so much that we become in need of help ourselves . [ 3 ] Neither are we required to take those actions that require the most sacrifice on our parts—Kant merely said that duties must be practiced for the sake of duty , not self-interest , to reflect a truly moral character . They recognized that we often have mixed motivations for our actions , including duty and self-interest , so we can never be sure we 're acting for the right reasons , although the actions may still be moral .
They also wrote that the duty of beneficence merely requires that we not be completely indifferent to the suffering of others—this is surely no extreme altruism that requites heroic selflessness on the part of agents ( as Rand wrote ) . More generally , this reminds us that technically all Kantian duties are negative in that they derive from a maxim of action being rejected by the categorical imperative . The perfect duties “ do not kill ” and “ do not lie ” are clearly negative , but the positive duty of beneficence is actually a duty not to be indifferent to the needs of others , resulting from a rejection of a maxim of indifference by the categorical imperative . As long as we are not indifferent to others ' suffering , and do what we can when we can within our other life circumstances ( for the sake of duty ) , we are moral agents .
When we recognize that all Kantian duties are negative in nature , we see that , when making recommendations for moral action , Kant was much more interested in telling us what we ought not do than what we ought to do . For instance , we must not lie , but we need not be completely forthright either : we are free to prevaricate , change the question , or be silent , as the circumstances dictate , provided we do not deceive outright . By the same token , we must not ignore completely the hardship of our fellow persons , but we are free to decide how and when to offer assistance , given our other commitments .
Abstaining from what you should not is fairly straightforward , but choosing what to do instead is more difficult , and Kant offers little guidance , other than to point to judgment , “ a peculiar talent which can be practiced only , and can not be taught. ” [ 4 ] There are no rules or formulae to guide judgment , but only one 's intuitive sense of the moral law . Judgment is necessary not only in deciding how to act within our duties , but also to choose which of two or more conflicting obligations is one 's true duty . For instance , if I promised to help my best friend move today , and then my mother calls and needs my help , only my judgment can tell me which obligation to act on : my duty to keep my promise to my friend or my duty to help my mother . Kant wrote only that we must act on whichever has “ the strongest ground of obligation , ” and we must use judgment to decide which that is . [ 5 ]
Given the negative nature of duties and the ubiquity of conflicts among them , our judgment ends up being more useful than the duties themselves , which are just the building blocks of moral behavior . The need for judgment to decide how to implement and balance duties and obligations also has the effect of highlighting the surprising degree of flexibility in Kant 's ethics , where even perfect duties can be overridden by an imperfect duty if the latter has a stronger ground of obligation . This flexibility belies caricatures of Kant as a cold , rigid moralist , and reveal them to be a true supporter of freedom within the bounds of sociality .
Kant 's Minimal Government
One reason Kant 's political philosophy is often overlooked may be that it is nearly inseparable from their moral philosophy , both based on the inviolable dignity of the individual . [ 6 ]
Kant holds the state to the same moral standards as they do individuals : all must respect the dignity of persons and not use them merely as means while not at the same time as ends . Their binding principle of governance , the Universal Principle of Justice , is almost identical to the universalization formula of the categorical imperative : the state can take only those actions that are consistent with the rightful freedom of all . To Kant , the state only exists to protect the autonomy of persons from wrongful interference from others ; in other words , the only legitimate use of state coercion—and , to Kant , a necessary role of the state—is to prevent the coercion of one person by another . The enforcement of the individual 's right to noninterference , a central principle of classical liberalism , is the central role of the state in Kant 's political philosophy .
Furthermore , Kant did not support forced beneficence , either as a matter of virtue or justice . Because beneficence is an imperfect duty , there is no required or “ due ” amount of help that one person owes another , and therefore there can be no correlative right to assistance . Beneficence , to be truly virtuous , must be given freely , and can not be coerced on the part of the needy by the state . This rules out any state welfare system , because any government assistance given to some citizens would represent forced beneficence on the part of others . As with many classical liberals , libertarians , and fiscal conservatives , Kant hoped that voluntary charity would be sufficient to help the poor and needy , but the minimal state they describe in their work , much like that of Robert Nozick that followed , does not demand it .
Kant 's minimal system of government , enforcing individuals ' rights of noninterference from each other as well as the state , should be sufficient to assure their reputation as a pre-eminent classical liberal . It only enhances that reputation to recognize that their moral philosophy embodies the same spirit of liberty and freedom , allowing maximal exercise of individuals ' autonomy to pursue their own ends , while helping others when we can , provided we do not interfere with the right of others to do the same . Together , the moral and political philosophy of Immanuel Kant seem to represent the ideal statement of classical liberalism , and I hope this essay contributes to their appreciation in that context .
The Justice Department is taking the first steps toward carrying out President Obama 's executive actions on gun control .

Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderObama political arm to merge with Holder-run group Barack , Michelle Obama expected to refrain from endorsing in 2020 Dem primary : report Ocasio-Cortez to be first guest on new Desus and Mero show MORE on Friday released three proposals to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) , which was one of the 23 actions ordered by Obama last week to tackle gun violence .
The proposed regulations would give local law-enforcement agencies access to the gun-sale database that is maintained by the FBI . The rules would also preserve records of denied weapons sales indefinitely .
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act already requires federal background checks for gun purchases , but not every firearm sale is covered under the law .
Currently , law enforcement agencies can not perform a NICS check when transferring , returning or selling weapons that have been confiscated , seized or recovered . The new rules would change that , allowing officials to perform a background check on people who receive those weapons to ensure that they are permitted to own a gun .

• Obama to unveil immigration plan Tuesday in Vegas
• GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss Clarence ( Saxby ) Saxby ChamblissSenate buzz grows for Abrams after speech electrifies Dems Ossoff tests waters for Georgia Senate run CIA 's ‘ surveillance state ' is operating against us all MORE to retire
Obama ordered the rule change in a Jan. 16 memo that called for “ rulemaking to give law enforcement the ability to run a full background check on an individual before returning a seized gun . ''
Holder is also proposing that the NICS hold on to records of denied weapon sales that are more than 10 years old . When the NICS was established , the Justice Department ordered that the records be moved to a storage facility after 10 years , which Holder says is no longer necessary .
`` The FBI has therefore determined that for NICS ' own internal business operations , litigation and prosecution purposes , and proper administration of the system , NICS shall retain denied transaction records on site , '' Holder wrote in a notice to be published in Monday 's Federal Register . `` The retention of denied transaction information ... will enhance the efficiency and operational capability of the NICS . ''
The proposed rules would also give Native American tribes access to NICS . Currently , only federal , state , or local agencies can perform the checks , which leaves out “ domestic dependent nations ” recognized by the United States .
The Justice Department is n't the only part of the administration that has been asked to take action in response to last month 's school shooting in Newtown , Conn . The president has also ordered the Department of Health and Human Services , the Department of Education and the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) to get involved .
One of Obama 's directives was to ensure coverage of mental health treatment in Medicaid and under the healthcare reform law . They also ordered increased training of school staff to help them recognize signs of mental illness .
The CDC , meanwhile , was directed to study the causes of gun violence . The president urged Congress to approve $ 10 million for the agency to examine whether there are links between shooting sprees and violent entertainment .
Comments on the Justice Department proposals are due by March 28 .
Cities like Reykjavik and Zurich have already quit using fossil fuels to produce power , and others plan to cut back . A new survey reveals just far 162 of them have gone .
As global climate talks near , Beijing and 10 other Chinese cities recently announced they will peak their heat-trapping emissions ( about equal to those of Brazil ) before China 's national target of 2030 . More than a dozen U.S. cities including New York joined in pledging emission cuts .
Pull Quote We definitely see cities as being on the leading edge . Kyra Appleby
How well , though , are other cities doing in quitting fossil fuels ? A glimpse emerges from a survey , released Thursday , of the current power mix of 162 cities worldwide . Many are moving to reduce carbon emissions , but some are further along than others .
Share of electric power obtained from nonfossil fuels Data provided by cities NG STAFFSOURCES : CDP ; AECOM
Brazil 's cities fared best . They reported getting an average of 76 percent of their electricity from cleaner sources , primarily hydropower , and their European counterparts averaged 59 percent , according to the data compiled by CDP ( formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project ) , a not-for-profit group nudging cities and companies to address climate change .
Overall , North American cities were n't quite as green , but Asian Pacific ones fared the worst , receiving only 15 percent—on average—of their electricity from cleaner sources such as nuclear , biomass , geothermal , hydro , solar , or wind .
Still , in almost every region , some cities stand out . Hong Kong , now heavily dependent on coal and gas , reports using financial incentives to boost investments in renewable energy . Austin , Texas , aims to get 55 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2025 . Stockholm , San Francisco and Vancouver are aiming for 100 percent by mid-century .
“ We definitely see cities as being on the leading edge . This is their moment , ” says Kyra Appleby , head of CDP 's cities program , noting most are using a variety of technologies to shift from fossil fuels . They say they 're often hubs of innovation and can act more quickly than states or countries .
Plus , many see the need to act . “ Climate change is n't a political issue—it 's a reality for cities , many of which are right now enduring drought , extreme weather , and wildfires as a result , ” the mayors of Los Angeles , Philadelphia , and Houston said last month in launching the # ClimateMayors Twitter campaign in advance of the United Nations ' climate summit that begins Nov. 30 in Paris .
The CDP survey , which relies on self-reporting from cities because of a dearth of global data at the city level , reveals vast gaps between those relying on fossil fuels and those nixing them .
No fossil fuels . Twenty-one cities say they use no fossil fuels to produce electricity . They include 16 smaller cities in Brazil that rely entirely or almost entirely on hydropower . The other five cities ( aside from Reykjavik and Zurich ) are Canada 's Winnipeg , Ethiopia 's Addis Ababa and Italy 's Padova—each of which relies heavily on hydro .

Many also rely heavily on hydropower , but two of them—Toronto and Paris—get at least half their power from nuclear plants .

Asuccess rate of 1 % . In what area of public life would we accept that ? Last year , Professor Neil McKeganey of the University of Glasgow , one of the most respected academics in Britain , established that the authorities seize just 1 % of the heroin that enters Scotland in any one year . They see no reason to think this would be any different for the nation as a whole .
Where were the headlines ? Surely the press , obsessed by crime and drug-fuelled violence , would have it splashed across the front page . Not a peep . Why not ?
If heroin gets in , we can only suppose cocaine and other drugs are smuggled in equally successfully . Gordon Meldrum , of the Scottish branch of the Serious Organised Crime Agency , tasked with coordinating our battle against drugs smuggling , shrugs : `` 1 % or 10 % – it is not good enough . '' They claim that a breakthrough in targeting top smugglers is around the corner , but when asked if there is any chance of achieving the 60-70 % target the United Nations estimates would be required to change fundamentally the market in illegal drugs , they simply shake their head .
I have been making a documentary series , Our Drugs War . They are not my first films on drugs . But even I was stunned by McKeganey 's 1 % figure – and the lack of response . I quoted it in interviews with senior police officers , drugs advisers and politicians ; few expressed surprise , little felt that current policies were remotely adequate . Most questioned whether the Home Office was the best place to make drugs policy ; surely it is an issue for health . But these public figures would only express their worries away from the camera .
I would ask why they were so concerned about opening up the debate . The response was almost comic in its predictability : `` The Daily Mail . '' Anyone who steps out of line on policy gets shot down fast . Just ask Professor David Nutt , one of the world leaders on the effects of drugs on the brain and the now ex-chairperson of the government 's advisory committee on the misuse of drugs . The home secretary summarily sacked them for stepping out of line .
Drugs policies have little to do with science , health risk or harm . They have been hijacked by the emotive rhetoric of moralists .
This fear of the Daily Mail is a dishonest excuse – the truth is that there is a collective lack of will to address one of our major social problems . We bury our heads and pretend that banning drugs equals regulation . Quite the reverse ; driving drugs underground leaves them unregulated and consumers unprotected . Just what is in the drugs they buy , what dose is safe , what are the side effects ? And not just `` old '' drugs such as cocaine . There 's the astonishing market in synthetic drugs which has grown up largely since the banning of ecstasy – operating in grey areas of legality and fuelling weekend parties up and down the country .
As Nutt 's replacement as government advisor , Les Iversen , has found , ban one and another appears . Last year mephedrone was the craze , got banned and has been replaced by naphyrone . Ban… ban… ban… As John Arthur , head of the Edinburgh drugs charity Crew , says : `` It seems to make sense to ban , but it does not work . It makes things worse . It criminalises everything . ''
This summer the nation 's kids are out on the round of music festivals where alcohol is sold more cheaply than water and tobacco companies can be sponsors . Yet to get their fix they will either end up breaking the law , buying dodgy stuff from dealers in toilets , or they will swallow many pills before the festival to avoid security checks .
The only way to control and channel this demand is to tell the truth . If a drug really kills , tell us . If it is really dangerous , tell us . But equally , be honest when it is not . Regulate supply via prescription or chemists .
Look at the impact of tobacco education . In my lifetime we have moved away from a society where we smoked in trains , planes and pubs . We have easily accepted that we can not smoke in any of them . We have been persuaded that tobacco really kills . Yet those who choose to go on smoking are free to do so . Because they want to .
Why should other drugs be so different ? Some poor souls will end up as addicts – that is inevitable . But it should be treated as an illness , not a crime . Addictions of all types are usually a product of self-medication to avoid facing the world and we should do everything to help .
Treatment is much , much cheaper than putting people through the justice system and maybe locking them up in prison – where they will come across more drugs , of course . In this age of cuts , huge savings could be made at every stage of the drugs story .
Then there is the wider context and cost – be it in Latin America , Mexico or now Afghanistan . I went to Kabul , where the west finances both sides of the conflict . On one side , soldiers die and our tax money is spent to uphold a government riddled with drug-related corruption . On the other , the huge profits from an illegal heroin trade supply over 60 % of the Taliban 's finance .
Drugs money in one form or another makes up almost half of Afghanistan 's GDP . These vast sums are generated solely because heroin is illegal .
On the frontline our policy has been equally confused . Some years British troops in Afghanistan are ordered to eliminate poppy production ; other years eradication is deemed counterproductive because it will alienate the farmers we need on our side .
General Stanley McChrystal , before they were replaced , was for leaving most farmers in peace , while the Kabul government , presumably operating on last year 's plans , sent teams down to Helmand on a determined drive to eradicate .
The counter-narcotics minister in Kabul shrewdly observes that if we ever stop it here , heroin will simply be grown somewhere else – the profits are too attractive .
Regulating drugs sensibly is not a magic solution . I make no bones about the dangers of drugs , be they heroin or the industrial cleaner , GBL [ gamma butyrolactone ] . People will continue to die each year .
I do not wish to undervalue the real emotion of each family , but we have to start being brave enough to acknowledge the level of failure of present strategies . Drugs are not a problem of morality and crime but of health .
One per cent . As a New York member of congress said to me : `` The definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again and get the same results . It 's true for the addict , it 's true for the addicted society , it 's true for our using a criminal justice model to solve a medical problem . ''

This is the 1970s of the popular imagination .
And Portland saw all of it -- and more -- during the game-changing Me Decade . Green-friendly and pleasure-seeking and protest-ready : the Rose City we all know today took root in the 1970s . ( You can see for yourself in the photo gallery above . )
But in important ways the city also remained deeply conservative throughout that long-ago decade , a working-class throwback on an increasingly cosmopolitan West Coast .
A minor example : In 1973 , Linda Franciscone , a credentialed teenage sportswriter , was denied entry to the press box at Civic Stadium ( now Providence Park ) because , well , because the fairer sex had never been allowed in . Another : until 1977 -- eight years after The Who 's `` Pinball Wizard '' stormed the Billboard charts -- pinball machines remained illegal in Portland .
That second example might not be so minor .
`` Once you pay off a police officer to overlook some nickel-and-dime pinball gambling , it does n't take a lot more to pay them off to overlook prostitution and narcotics , '' Capt . Norman Reiter said in 1976 in a last-ditch attempt to head off legalization of pinball wizardry .
Reiter had a point . Police corruption was much more than a nickel-and-dime problem in Oregon 's biggest burgh . The booming narcotics trade would lead to officers being charged with stealing , evidence destruction and lying to judges to get search warrants . ( Official corruption is the theme of `` Rose City Vice , '' a new 1970s-set history by Phil Stanford that gleefully zeroes in on bed-hopping politicians -- such as disgraced former wunderkind Neil Goldschmidt -- and murderous , establishment-connected hoods . )
To some observers , such dark deeds seemed an inevitable result of the country 's sudden decline . Stagflation held down employment and the stock market . The national `` energy crisis '' prompted Oregon Gov . Tom McCall to ban outdoor display lighting in the state , plunging Portland into darkness . An editorial in The Oregonian suggested that `` bright light '' advertising was a moral issue -- just look at that prostitution haven Las Vegas , where neon ruled ! -- but added that economics trumped even family-values concerns . `` [ T ] he gravity of the impending energy crunch in Oregon this fall and winter , '' the paper wrote in 1973 , `` will seriously question whether businesses should remain open at night at all . ''
So the 1970s was in many ways a dreary decade for Portland , even with the Trail Blazers winning their lone NBA championship . It was a decade punctuated by long lines at gas stations and the deterioration of the region 's long-dominant industries . As a result , the city seemed to be physically falling apart . The New York Times ' Ada Louise Huxtable lamented `` the scattered , bomb-site look of downtown parking lots made by demolishing older buildings that pay less than metered asphalt . ''
For relief from the urban blight and waylaid dreams , Portlanders increasingly turned to smut . Mary 's Club and other strip shops packed in customers , while adult bookstores popped up around the city . The Oregonian called Portland `` the pornography capital of the West Coast . ''
But the city 's denizens did n't just watch naked women dance . They danced themselves , flooding venues that pumped an addictive beat until dawn .
`` Discomania is a billion-dollar business that has Oregon business people hustling , '' The Oregonian 's Patrice Haffey wrote in 1978 . And it was n't just dance clubs like Earthquake Ethel 's raking it in . Added Haffey : `` To buy a woman 's disco outfit , including a dress that will 'move ' on the dance floor , good dancing shoes and a disco bag ( a tiny purse to carry lipstick , identification and money that is worn around the neck like a pendant while dancing ) , can cost as much as $ 250 . ''
Portland 's economic revival had to start somewhere .

An area about 12 times the size of Barangaroo will be quarantined from Sydney 's apartment boom , a move supporters say will ensure emerging businesses and industry are not pushed out of the inner city .
The 265-hectare `` southern employment lands '' – parts of Alexandria and Rosebery previously reserved for heavy industry – is to be opened up for the first time to retail uses , offices and new types of commercial enterprise .
But the new planning controls , which have been adopted by the City of Sydney , only allow private residential development in two `` investigation '' areas on the precinct 's fringes – and only where this supports the provision of `` substantial '' affordable rental housing .
Lord Mayor Clover Moore said 17,000 new dwellings were either built , under construction or approved in the Sydney council area during the past financial year , `` but we also need to accommodate the massive jobs growth Sydney is experiencing '' .
Friday Facts # 181 - Calm before the storm
Posted by Klonan & V453000 on 2017-03-10 , all posts
Work this week has been progressing nicely on 0.15 . We hope we will be able to start our internal play testing soon , as the team works to close off the rest of the major features . Rseding will be arriving here in Prague next week for another of their infamous visits , and Harkonnen will be joining us shortly after , so the office will be prepared for tackling any issues that may arise .
Since we are going to be spending the next period polishing and fixing what we already have , you can look forward to some less interesting FFF posts in the coming days . Take the lack of exiting new topics to cover as a good omen that the whole team 's effort is on getting everything ready for the release .
Press key & content policy
Video and content creators are a really integral part of our success as a developer , without the exposure and feedback we receive from reviews , critique and lets plays of the game , Factorio would not be what it is today . While this probably wo n't be the last time , I wanted to express our deepest gratitude to everybody who has helped to spread the word about our project , and to every one of our community members and contributors .
For a long time we have offered press keys on our website . For channels that meet our requirements , we give a free review key in exchange for their thoughts and coverage . This next section might not be as interesting to Factorio players , but I would like to take this opportunity to share some word of warning for any other developers or small publishers with any similar system .
There are some people who will try to exploit this press key policy of ours . The simplest attempts are just straight imitation of a famous Youtube or Twitch personality , usually hoping we do n't try to verify any of their information . A different approach some take is much more effective . They will have a successful channel already , and email us asking for keys to review the game and play some multiplayer . So since they have some community for their content , and it seems like a good deal for both of us , we 'll give them a couple of steam keys . However they do n't cover the game , and instead sell the keys . Several weeks later , they will send in another email , hoping we 've forgotten about their previous requests .
These cases have raised some moral question in me about whether it is acceptable to deactivate a review key . If a channel writes in and asks to cover our game , and even 6 months later they have n't shown the game at all , do they deserve to keep their free copy ?
I would also like to clarify our policy on Factorio content . We 100 % support any and all content you make about Factorio , and fully support content creators rights to monitize this content . We do n't require you to ask permission , or get a key from us directly , if you want to cover the game , we will never claim your videos or copyright strike your accounts . If you 'd like some further reassurance , feel free to email us and we can provide a statement to put your mind at ease .
Chemical plant & Refinery
I ( Vaclav ) have been working on a little side-project whenever I could find an extra hour here and there . Since we made the pipes in high resolution , everything else has become visually incompatible with them ( mainly in the connecting points ) . This motivated me to make more pipe-related entities in high resolution to get everything to match .
The process was `` just render it in double resolution '' , paste the pipe graphics in the spots where necessary , and then hardcore Photoshop paints over them . I bought a new portable Wacom device , which allows me to do exactly this kind of work whenever I 'm not at the workstation ( on a bus , home on a sofa , etc . ) , which is very time efficient and I really enjoy doing it .
For now it 's the refinery and chemical plant , maybe I will be able to complete the storage tank for 0.15 as well . Even if I wo n't , we will just update the graphics during the 0.15 experimental phase .
As a bonus , we added a tint to the working animation of chemical plants , so you can tell what recipes are being processed . Some of them are quite similar , so it is n't as easy to tell which is which , but it 's certainly clearer than it was before .
As always , if you have any thoughts or feedback , let us know on our forum .
If you 're looking for a place close to Chattanooga with a truly remote and rugged feel , Savage Gulf is a 15,590-acre natural area on the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau that features 50 miles of trails , pristine waterfalls , and expansive canyon views . The Gulf is roughly 1-1.5 hours outside of Chattanooga depending on which of the four park entrances you choose ( all accessible from I-24 ) . Whether you spend a day or a 3-day weekend , you will find more than your fair share of excellent hiking , backpacking , and camping adventures .
Savage Gulf offers natural features such as waterfalls , sinks , scenic overlooks , sheer sandstone cliffs and canyons , and an interesting geological formation known as Stone Door , which is a 10-by-100-foot crack stretching from the top of the escarpment into the gorge . Historic features such as an old stage road , the Laurel Mill site , remnants of moonshine stills , and a suspension bridge give you a glimpse into a life of an earlier time .
Water is plentiful in Savage Gulf . Plan to see waterfalls that drop over limestone ledges and flow into sinks before disappearing underground . You 'll also witness cascading creeks that tumble down over 5 miles , dropping over 800 feet through narrow gorges to form the `` Gulfs . ''
With over 50 miles of trails , Savage Gulf has a wonderful mixture of technical , challenging trails , and easier , less technical options . It is a treat anytime of the year , whether you visit in the spring and summer when the wildflowers are putting on a wonderful show of bright colors or in the fall when the leaves show off their breathtaking autumnal hues . Winter offers its own special beauty when the falls ice up and pockets of snow become visible under the giant rhododendrons .
Here are a few RootsRated recommendations for which trails to access when visiting this beautiful wilderness area .
1 . From the Stone Door Ranger Station and Greeter Falls , head out on the Alum Gap lollipop loop trail until you reach Greeter Falls , which drops over a 15-foot upper ledge , then plummets 50-feet into a cold , clear plunge pool . Instead of retuning to Alum Gap , take the Big Creek Rim trail and stay on the escarpment or take the Big Creek Gulf trail . The first option offers spectacular views , and the latter is a technically challenging trail with views of Ranger Falls , Big Creek , several springs and sinks , and a solid climb back out through the stone door . Both options are around 9 miles .
2 . Another great loop option begins at the Collins West park entrance . Follow the trail from the parking lot and when it reaches a crossroads , choose your direction . If you head to the right , you 'll enter a boulder field and then traverse the escarpment for several miles . You can take the trail down the Stage Road before taking the Collins Gulf trail , or you can stay on the South Rim and continue to Savage Falls Campground . From here , continue on the North Rim to the picturesque Hobbs Cabin and the Connector trail , or turn onto the North Plateau and loop around until you run into the Connector . Perhaps you 'll want to try the challenging ( steep and rocky ) Stage Road back up . The mileage with these options can vary from roughly 9 miles to 25 miles depending on your combinations , and the variety of terrain you 'll encounter will vary as much as your mileage .
3 . Finally , from the Savage Ranger Station , try the Savage Day Loop for a 4+ mile option or add on the Dinky Line/North Plateau to Oak Mountain trail loop with a return on the North Rim trail for roughly 11+ miles . Most of these trails have great footing and plenty to see from Savage Creek , which enters its gorge over cascades and drops 30-foot at Savage Falls to Gulf views .
When you 're done exploring this amazing wilderness area , head to nearby Sequatchie County restaurant , The Cookie Jar Cafe , for some really great meat-and-three southern cuisine .
Thousands of fast-food and retail workers are set to go on strike across the United States Thursday to push for a $ 15 hourly wage , after a similar action last month bolstered confidence but not pay , organizers said .
`` If you work in a fast-food or retail store anywhere in the country , we urge you to join our growing movement , '' striker Terrance Wise said in a news release earlier this month .
Wise , 34 , is a Kansas City-based father of three who says they earn $ 9.30 an hour at Burger King , where they have worked for eight years .
Burger King had not responded to an interview request regarding Wise 's wages by the time of publication .
About 1,000 strikers participated in the previous action in July , according to Martin Rafanan of Missouri Jobs with Justice . The group is coordinating the strikes together with similar grass-roots organizations across the country and larger advoacy groups , like the Service Employees International Union .
The more than 4 million fast-food workers in the United States made an average annual wage of $ 18,130 in 2010 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .

Restaurant industry advocates have criticized the planned strike .
`` We welcome a debate on fair wages , but it needs to be based on facts . And the facts show that the majority of workers who earn the minimum wage in the United States are not employed in the restaurant industry , '' the National Restaurant Association 's vice president of labor and workforce policy , Angelo Amador , told Al Jazeera .
An Association spokesperson , Christin Fernandez , told Al Jazeera that `` restaurants already operate on very thin profit margins . Signficant additional labor costs can negatively impact a restaurant 's ability to hire or maintain jobs . ''
Some workers have reportedly faced dismissal for participating in the strikes .
According to Rafanan , one of the participants in July 's actions was fired for striking , but pressure from other strikers and organizers pushed the employer to re-hire the striker , who eventually got a raise .
`` If workers see the community will stand up for their rights , that will empower others , '' Rafanan said .
In most cases , it is illegal in the United States to fire workers solely because they go on strike , but companies can replace striking employees to fill vacant positions in some instances .
Although for most strikers the actions have not yet achieved their dual objectives of garnering a $ 15 per hour wage and allowing them to unionize without alleged pressure from management , organizers said the strikes emboldened workers to advocate for what they consider to be a fair wage and work environment .
`` The strike gives workers hope . It shows them they do not stand alone . It gives them a space to build a movement , '' Rafanan said .
McDonald 's sales rose by 0.7 percent in July despite the walk-outs , according to Bloomberg . Organizers said the strikes are not a boycott and do not aim to affect corporate earnings .

If there 's one defining characteristic of the 2015 Formula One season , it 's the rivalry between Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg . However , Mercedes F1 team executive director Toto Wolff told Motorsport.com that if the rivalry ever hurts the team , they may replace one of the pair .
After the hat-throwing incident at the United States Grand Prix , Wolff admitted to Sky Sports F1 that the emotional rivalry was “ what the sport needs. ” After all , it made Hamilton and Rosberg human in an era when too many racing drivers come off as characterless dull-bots .
Now that the season is over , Wolff admits that the tension has n't been a walk in the park for the Mercedes team . Whenever one driver is angry about a team loss , it has affected not only how the drivers work with each other , but with other team members .
Wolff explained to Motorsport.com :
There is lots going on behind closed doors . I feel that the team is stronger than ever . We are having huge unity within the team , but the difficult relationship of the drivers is one of our weaknesses . And that is not good . If I were to analyze what are the biggest strengths and the biggest weakness of the team , I would say the biggest strength is the quality and the characters of the personalities within the team . The biggest weakness is the dynamic of the relationship between the drivers – and sometimes between the drivers and the team .

Of course , the Yas Marina season ender was n't without some debate over Lewis Hamilton 's tire strategy and engine modes . In an analysis of where Hamilton may have lost the race on strategy , James Allen on F1 also mentions that Hamilton turned up their engine modes despite their team 's wishes otherwise . Hamilton switching to a different engine mode than their teammate — which the team maintains is unfair — was a persistent enough problem last season at Bahrain and Spain for the team to reach an agreement with Hamilton not to do it . Nonetheless , Hamilton tried to override this in the last 14 laps of the season finale .
Wolff believes that the team should do better at managing Lewis Hatfield and Nico McCoy , and if they ca n't , a significant change will need to happen . Wolff elaborated to Motorsport.com :
We took the decision of having two evenly matched drivers in order to make the team progress faster and better . It was a very conscious decision three years ago . Going forward , we will consider if it is the best set-up for the team . Personality and character within the team is a crucial ingredient for the team success . If we feel that it is not aligned with the general consensus , spirit and philosophy within the team , we might consider that when we take a decision , in terms of the driver line-up going forward .

To Wolff , this would n't be a change to a number-one and number-two driver order per se , but a likely change in personnel .
“ I think it is important to have talented and fast drivers in the car , ” Wolff told Motorsport.com . “ But we want to work with nice guys . ”
Which of the two is more likely to go ? Rosberg 's contract runs through 2016 , although it likely includes an option for extension , and Hamilton 's contract was recently extended through 2018 . However , Wolff made it clear to Motorsport.com that one of those contracts could be ended early if things really turn sour .

While most of the emphasis is on the drivers in the cars , Formula One is still a team sport — and that entire team has to be performing at their best in order to win . If strained relations between drivers and the rest of the team makes it difficult to get the cars set up correctly , or to put together and execute a race-winning strategy , then of course the team will want to make a change . The team wants to win .
For now , though , it seems as if Wolff 's warning has n't changed much . Following a season where Rosberg claimed that Hamilton was too aggressive in several on-track incidents , Hamilton told the BBC :
You 've seen [ Rosberg ] complains about a lot of things . But you kind of let it go over your head because that 's just the way they are . It 's kind of the different background we come from , I guess
Hamilton was filming an episode of the BBC One F1 Review show when they mentioned their teammate . When they referred to their different backgrounds , it 's a shot at the fact that Rosberg grew up as the son of F1 driver Keke Rosberg in Monaco , while Hamilton 's divorced parents were of considerably humbler means .

Hamilton continued to the BBC , defending moves like those they made at Suzuka and Circuit of the Americas :
On the racing side of things you have to be tough . You ca n't be nice out there , and go : “ Hey , here 's some space. ” I mean business . I 'm not here to make friends , to finish the race and say : “ Hey , that was a lovely race , chap , you were so friendly with me , you let me win. ” This is the one opportunity and you take it . That does n't mean wiping someone out or cheating but you have to be fierce , strong and hard to as much of the limit as you can be . And you can ask every world champion , if you 're on the outside , you have to back off .

EU trade ministers are closer to reaching `` the common position '' required to begin negotiations on a new EU-US trade agreement , according to Minister for Jobs , Enterprise and Innovation , Richard Bruton .
They were speaking at an `` informal '' meeting of EU trade ministers in Dublin Castle today .
As the current chair of the EU 's Council of Trade Ministers , Mr Bruton has set an end-of-June deadline for a final agreement on the mandate to start talks on a proposed free trade agreement with the US .
`` This agreement is a crucial part in the process of starting negotiations on a new EU-US Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement , ” they said .
`` A new trade deal has the potential to provide a real boost to economic growth and job creation , without the need for increased expenditure by Governments . ”
According to the EU Commission , a comprehensive agreement with the US could produce an additional 6 per cent growth in exports for the EU , bringing the total benefit to the EU of a new trade agreement to €220 billion .
In a first for the EU , a key figure from the US administration , Mike Froman , deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs , met with EU ministers to discuss the issues around a new EU-US free trade agreement .
`` It provided a very valuable opportunity for EU trade ministers to hear first-hand the approach the US side proposes to take . It also allowed them to see the support among Member States for a far-reaching trade agreement , ” Mr Bruton said .
Earlier , the head of the World Trade Organisation , Pascal Lamy , cautioned minsters that opening up sectors like agriculture could slow the pace of progress in forging a new deal .

Clark Park 's bronze statue of Charles Dickens , crafted by Frank Elwell in the late nineteenth century , is one of Philadelphia 's public art treasures . For many , the Dickens corner of Clark Park is a special place , something of a sanctuary . In their will , Dickens declared that they wanted no monuments made in their memory–and for more than a century , the magnificent statue at 43rd and Chester was in fact the only sculpted likeness of them in the world . In honor of Charles Dickens 's timeless writing and their special connection to our neighborhood , the Friends of Clark Park holds annual birthday parties .
At 2pm sharp on Sunday , February 5th in Griffith Hall ( 43rd and Kingsessing ) all are invited to this year 's gathering to commemorate the 200th birthday . It promises to be our biggest and best party in many years . Of course there will be birthday cake for Dickens and a procession to the statue to sing Happy Birthday–but the centerpiece of the party is Dickens himself . Actors and musicians will recreate Dickens 's world for us with songs and excerpts from their novels . Presenters will include British folksinger and actor David Jones , Curio Theatre 's Jared Reed and Paul Kuhn , and local favorites Frank Chance and Ceil Mann . Readings this year will feature A Christmas Carol , Pickwick Papers , and David Copperfield . We are also very happy to welcome the Kingsessing Morris Men dancers , who will perform Morris dancing during the reception . Many behind-the-scenes volunteers are working to make this year 's Charles Dickens Birthday Party a success , but special mention is due to the artistic contributions of David Comberg 's Advanced Design class at Penn for creating Dickensian posters and other promotional materials . Their work can be seen throughout the neighborhood . Their specially designed napkins can be picked up at the Green Line Cafe , Local 44 , and Milk & Honey Market .

LYRICS
high in the mountains and deep in the pines
lies the source of a vortex where certain forces align
with nothing to do but commune with the trees
in the valley of mist and shadow restless souls can be released
why do people wonder if there is evil in the world ?
if it 's lurking in the darkness until its plans can unfurl
when it 's standing before you in the clear light of day
in a finely tailored suit with a smile on its face
sun and moon
light and shadow
sacred ground
to be hallowed
in the hills
and the hollows
where it wills
we will follow
sun and moon , light and shadow
sacred ground to be hallowed
in the hillsand the hollows
where it wills , we will follow

There are only 1,100 Lamborghini Aventador LP 750-4 SV Coupe and Convertibles around the globe and those exotics are made for the one-percent of the one-percent . The WheelsandMore Lamborghini Aventador LP800-SV La maXXina takes the rare car to a whole new level of exclusivity and performance thanks to a few simple goodies .
While shedding weight was the main goal for Lamborghini in the Aventador LP 750-4 SV , WheelsandMore was able to shed a few extra pounds , resulting in better overall performance . The factory forged monoblock wheels were swapped out for even lighter two-piece carbon-rim F.I.W.E . megalight forged wheels with weight-optimized centers from WheelsandMore . This saves about 4.4 lbs . of weight per wheel on the Aventador LP800-SV La maXXina .
The weight loss also transferred to the V-12 engine . WheelsandMore installed a new one-off , handcrafted exhaust system with integrated valves that cuts an additional 13.2 lbs . The optimized backpressure is paired up with a new software ECU tune that optimizes various parameters in the Aventador LP800-SV La maXXina to create a total of 800 horsepower and 524 lb-ft. of torque .
Armed with the incredibly high output , the WheelsandMore Aventador LP800-SV La maXXina can reach 62 mph from rest in 2.7 seconds while the top speed remains the same due to the limitations of the Pirelli tires .
The new WheelsandMore Lamborghini Aventador LP800-SV La maXXina upgrade program will be available for Aventador 750-4 SV models .

Is the WheelsandMore LP800-SV La maXXina the ultimate Lamborghini Aventador SV ?
A fabulous piece of photographic history just sold at auction for $ 406,000 , more than twice the estimated haul . This Nikon One was the third production camera — as in the third actual camera it built — from the now-famous company , and it 's the oldest one known to still be around today .
Nikon began as a optics company , Nippon Kogaku K.K. , in 1917 , and made a few lenses and even worked on a Canon body in the 1930s . But 1948 was the first year it made its own cameras , starting with the One or me , of which less than a thousand were made . ( A bit more history here . )
It 's an interchangeable-lens rangefinder , and the lens included is also an old one : the 11th Nikon ever made , a 50mm f/2 that collapses back into the body . It comes with a great old double-strap leather case that I would definitely like a replica of for my Olympus .
While it 's certainly an interesting piece of history , it probably wo n't be doing much shooting : It used a non-standard film size that limited its appeal , something Nikon fixed in following models .
[ gallery ids= '' 1422394,1422395,1422396,1422397,1422398,1422393 '' ]
Engraved on the bottom , rather prominently , is “ MADE IN OCCUPIED JAPAN , ” a rather chilling reminder of the times in which this camera was made .
The starting price for this historic camera was €90,000 , and it was estimated to go as high as €180,000 ; it eventually sold for €384,000 , ( approximately the asupervisorstioned $ 406,000 ) , inclusive of the fees and premiums .
You can check out the other cameras , lenses and other odds and ends that were on the block at the WestLicht Photographica Auction here . DPReview points out a couple of excellent finds , including a Leica camera-rifle and a wonderful-looking M3 owned by Herbert List .
One of Labour 's biggest donors today warned the party 's moderate wing to `` wake up '' to the fact that continuing to promise austerity-lite was the `` road to unelectability . ''
JML chairperson John Mills , who is normally associated with the Blairite wing of the Labour party , said the anti-austerity policies being pursued by Jeremy Corbyn `` made a lot of sense '' and could be popular with the public in 2020 .
Speaking to reporters in central London , they said it was a fundamental mistake to compare the nation 's finances to a household paying off its credit card , and warned the UK was being condemned to long periods of low growth .
They said the policies being pursued by the government , and endorsed by some in the Labour party , risked causing widespread dissatisfaction with the governing class and would lead to an increase in support for parties such as Ukip .
They also attacked Tony Blair 's government for allowing wholsesale buyouts of British business by foreign companies . They said a new `` public interest test '' was needed to prevent what was left of British industry being sold abroad .
Mills also expressed limited support for Corbyn 's plans to implement so-called `` people 's quantative easing '' . They said it was sensible to borrow for investment in capital projects , but warned against any wider application , saying that it was not a `` magic trick '' that could be relied upon to re-inflate the economy .
However , they also warned that Labour 's plans to increase spending would be `` disastrous '' if they were not matched with a wider strategy to rebalance the economy in favour of manufacturing .
Re-inflating the economy , without rebalancing in favour of manufacturing , would lead to a repeat the kind of financial crisis seen repeatedly under previous Labour governments , they said . Mills added that Labour had been `` very effective '' at creating such crises over the past fifty years .
Mills criticised Corbyn 's recent appearance in front of the Stop the War Coalition Christmas party , but said there were other signs they could move the party to the centre ground over the next few years .
Mills will meet with John McDonnell tomorrow morning to attempt to persuade them to adopt a radical new economic agenda .
They will tell McDonnell the UK is living in a `` fools paradise '' of high exchange rates and cheap consumer goods . They believe the exchange rate must come down significantly to restore strong growth to the economy .
Asked whether they thought the public would be willing to vote for more expensive holidays , Mills insisted that UK politicians had to take `` hard decisions '' and then persuade the public they were right . They revealed they had commissioned polling which suggests the public , although largely opposed to weakening the pound , were open to persuasion .
Mills said they would continue to fund the Labour party but would now concentrate more on funding think tanks in order to shift the political and economic consensus in their direction . However , they said they were open to playing a larger role within the Labour party if they were asked by Corbyn .

Usually when lawmakers stage all-night filibusters , they do so to protest a piece of legislation . Senator Ted Cruz , for example , spoke for twenty-one hours last September in opposition to a resolution intended to avert a government shutdown . Texas State Senator Wendy Davis spoke through the night in August to protest an anti-abortion bill . Ad Policy
The senators planning to take the floor Monday evening , however , are doing so to raise alarm about an absence of legislation . More than two dozen Democrats and two Independents intend to speak from the end of voting Monday afternoon until approximately 9 am Tuesday to call for congressional action to counter climate change .
“ The cost of Congress ' inaction on climate change is too high for our communities , our kids and grandkids , and our economy , ” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said in a statement . “ On Monday we 'll be sending a clear message : it 's time for Congress to wake up and get serious about addressing this issue . ”
Whitehouse has given floor speeches about climate change some sixty times over the past two years , speaking weekly when the Senate is in session . On Monday he 'll be joined by Hawaii 's Brian Schatz , who helped to organize the event ; majority leader Harry Reid ; Environment and Public Works committee chairperson Barbara Boxer ; and about twenty-four other senators , including independents Angus King and Bernie Sanders .
Congress has not considered any serious climate legislation since the summer of 2010 , when a fragile bipartisan coalition supporting a cap-and-trade bill collapsed . Since then , Republicans have grown more entrenched in climate denialism , and have made it clear that any attempt to regulate carbon pollution would fail . Just last Friday , minority leader Mitch McConnell told the Cincinnati Enquirer that they did n't believe in human-made climate change . “ For everybody who thinks it 's warming , I can find somebody who thinks it is n't , ” McConnell said .
Monday 's all-nighter—it 's not technically a filibuster , since no bill is on the table—is part of long-term campaign by the newly launched Senate Climate Action Task Force to heighten the sense of urgency about climate change , and pressure lawmakers to take a more aggressive stance on carbon regulation . The group is playing defense , too , trying to fend off attempts to undermine President Obama 's Climate Action Plan , most significantly the new Environmental Protection Agency rules for carbon emissions from power plants . Without any legislation on the horizon , the initial task for the group is to shift the political climate so that denialism and inaction becomes a liability .
That challenge is evident in the midterm elections . Many of the Democratic incumbents in tight races come from conservative energy states : Mary Landrieu from Louisiana , Mark Begich from Alaska , Mark Pryor from Arkansas , Kay Hagan from North Carolina and Mark Warner from Virginia . They 've distanced themselves from their colleagues ' climate fight , criticized the EPA 's efforts to regulate carbon pollution , and publically support the Keystone XL pipeline . None are expected to be present Monday night .
But if they want to hold on to the Senate , Democrats have to defend those seats in the midterms . Rather than start an intraparty war as the Tea Party has done within the GOP , the Democratic climate push is focused largely on the right 's refusal to acknowledge human-made climate change , with an eye towards making it a major issue in 2016 . Tom Steyer , the billionaire behind climate-focused super PAC Next Gen , said last month that their group is not planning to attack oil-friendly Democrats in the midterms , although it wo n't give money to them either . Next week , Senator Whitehouse will bring their climate speech to Iowa , which hosts the first major voting for the presidential nominees .
“ Climate change threatens Rhode Island coasts and Iowa farmlands alike , and I look forward to this opportunity to talk to rural Americans about the threats they face , ” Whitehouse said in a statement . “ I also realize that in order to advance serious climate change legislation in Congress , we need to make climate change a major topic in the 2016 presidential race . ”

During the first half hour of the game at Red Bull Arena it seemed like only a matter of time before Rochester broke the deadlock . The number of and quality of the chances that the visitors created suggested that they might run over the New York Red Bulls II . Despite that promising start , a change in style from the home side in the second half stymied Rochester 's possession and the two teams finished scoreless .
Rochester produced a number of highlight reel moments in the 2015 USL season opener . Christian Volesky was the best Rhinos player in the run of play . The rookie forward got in behind the NYRB II defense multiple times but Homegrown goalkeeper Santiago Castano came up with a series of huge saves .
Rhinos Finalize Roster Ahead of their season opener against NYRB2 , the Rhinos have made their signings and cut the other trialists .
Volesky excels at a poacher 's role , playing in a pocket of space just off the shoulder of the opposition 's centerback . The Southern Illinois University product took advantage of the inexperience of their opponents but could n't find the back of the net .
Second-year-Rhino Johnny Mendoza looked to pick up from where they left off in the team 's final preseason game . Against Syracuse , the Colombian-American winger had three assists off of set pieces and their service against NYRB was equally dangerous .
Mendoza repeatedly created chances for their teammates to score from corner kicks in the first half . A notable opportunity saw Tony Walls attempt to poke home a Mendoza corner after Castano was stuck in no-man's-land but right back James Thomas cleared the ball off the goal-line .
Center referee Ryan Dos Reis pointed to the spot after Mike Garzi won the ball from Victor Manosalvas in the area . The 18th pick in the 2015 MLS SuperDraft , Leo Stolz stepped up to the spot but hit a very weak penalty to their left side . Fourth-year Rhinos goalkeeper Brandon Miller dove to their right and easily stopped the penalty attempt .
By the end of the first half , Rochester head coach Bob Lilley was looking for ways to rejuvenate their side 's stagnating attack . After NYRB II center back Konrad Plewa went down with a leg injury , Colin Heffron pinched over to the middle from left back and academy player Marcello Borges entered the game at full back . Immediately Lilley swapped Alex Dixon , a more attack-minded player , to the right side for Mendoza in order to take advantage of the young player 's inexperience and cold legs .
Rochester had the best of possession and had created more quality attacks but NYRB II had the best chance of the first half from the spot . In the second half , the home side came out with a different mindset . The young Red Bulls players showed cohesion in a higher pressure system when they lost possession . This tweak forced Rochester 's midfielders to play passes back to their defense and the defenders were prone to mistakes .
NYRB II created chances from their high pressure in midfield and gradually took the game by the scruff of the neck over the course of the second half . Whereas Castano was under a constant barrage in the first frame , they had little to do in the second . The home side was n't exactly getting shots through to Rochester 's Miller , however , as the visiting defenders made vital interceptions and interventions to prevent shots on goal .
Santiago Castano was standing on their head during the first half and Lilley made a number of attacking substitutions late in the game in attempts to recreate that situation . Marcos Ugarte , Kenardo Forbes , Asani Samuels , and Duba all entered the game in the second half to try to kick-start the visitor 's attack to no avail .
Captaining the side on its season opener , returning defender/midfielder Tony Walls was a vital player for the Rhinos in the middle of the field . Walls showed a great example of simple veteran defensive play came amid a period of sustained attack by NYRB II . Haitian U-20 winger Derrick Etienne was winding up a rebounded shot after the ball pinged around the penalty area when Walls used their stocky frame just enough to set the attacker off without conceding a penalty .
This crafty physical challenge is indicative of the quality defensive play the Rhinos are known for under Bob Lilley . If the team can work on finishing Mendoza 's corners or developing options when Volesky breaks through the defense , Rochester can find success during the 2015 USL season .
A young man was shot and killed on Ritchie Street in Ottawa 's west end Wednesday night , the city 's fourth homicide of the year and second of the week .
Taylor Morrow-Flint , 20 , died at the scene , police said .

Officers responded to a home in the 80 block of Ritchie Street around 7:30 p.m. , said Staff Sgt . Bruce Pirt of the Ottawa police major crimes unit .
There are no suspects in custody and no suspect descriptions , Pirt said .
No one else was injured .
Nothing yet to suggest 2 homicides related
Police are interviewing witnesses and are asking anyone with information to call the major crimes unit at 613-236-1222 , extension 5493 .
Mohamed Ali Hassan , 19 , was stabbed to death in an Overbrook park two days earlier .
Michael Leblanc , a 26-year-old Ottawa resident , has been charged with second-degree murder in relation to Monday 's homicide .
Pirt said they always explore the idea that violent crimes are related but there 's nothing to suggest Wednesday 's killing is linked to anything else .
The Golden Gate Bridge has long had a reputation as one of America 's most beautiful landmarks , and also one of its deadliest . For decades it has been the “ number one location ” for suicide attempts , with nearly 40 known people jumping to their deaths in 2016 and about 200 more being talked away from its ledges . Now officials are taking a $ 200 million step to change that .
On Thursday , after years of debate and development , California officials commemorated the beginning of construction on a “ suicide deterrent ” net that will span both sides of the Golden Gate Bridge . California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi planned to attend , along with families who have lost loved ones to fatal jumps , marking the launch of a first-of-its-kind project by giving remarks and planting flowers .
“ The Golden Gate Bridge is a source of immense pride to San Francisco . But for too many families in our community , it has also been a place of pain , ” Pelosi , who represents the San Francisco area in Congress , told TIME in a statement on Wednesday . They describe the barrier as “ a suicide deterrent system that will save countless lives ” and “ an achievement years in the making . ”
Expected to be finished by 2021 , the project initially estimated to cost $ 76 million now has a price tag of over $ 200 million . Priya Clemens , spokesperson for the Golden Gate Bridge , Highway and Transportation District , says that increase is partly due to the “ experimental ” nature of the project , which led designers to underestimate how much it would actually cost to attach a net of this size across more than a mile and a half of open water and windy air . While locals have floated the idea of adding some kind of barrier since the 1940s , just years after the bridge opened , discussions about the current project got started about a decade ago . Suicide prevention advocates have propelled it .

When the project is completed , the stainless steel mesh net will be located about 20 feet below the bridge and stretch 20 feet out from its edges , running the length of seven football fields . If a person jumped onto the net , it would be unforgiving , Clemens says , perhaps leading to broken bones . And a person could still find their way to a drop off its upturned edge . But it is the net 's existence , more than its ability to catch , that officials hope will deter people from trying to jump in the first place . The number of people attempting jumps has been increasing in recent years , Clemens says , though it is unclear why .
Researchers have tried to analyze the Golden Gate Bridge 's tendency to draw people who want to end their lives , sometimes after they 've taken flights from other parts of the country to do so . A 1970s study noted that from the bridge 's opening in 1937 up until that point , more than 500 known people had leapt off its ledges . Trying to understand the landmark 's “ fatal attraction , ” the researchers sought out interviews with the roughly 1 % of people who had survived .
Of the six survivors the researchers interviewed , every one said their plans involved only that spot and four of the six said they would not have attempted suicide if they had been unable to jump from the bridge – if , for example , there were a “ suicide barrier ” that prevented it . One survivor said the beauty of the “ readily available ” bridge attracted them . Another associated the jump with entering “ golden doors ” to a new spiritual realm . The promise that the method would be effective brought them , too . Because the site situated roughly 220 feet above the water was already so famous for suicides , that reputation apparently became self-perpetuating .
Similar reasons for the Golden Gate 's unfortunate appeal were suggested in studies conducted during ensuing decades . “ The Golden Gate Bridge is an iconic suicide magnet . For some , the bridge is an easily accessible site — pedestrian access , a 4-foot railing , a bus stop , and a parking lot , ” write the researchers in a 2009 study published by The American Journal of Psychiatry . “ For others , the bridge is a romantic final exit . Some believe bridge suicide is a painless death . One jumper reportedly left a note on the bridge reading , ‘ Why do you make it so easy ? ' ”
Other studies showed that structures such as the nearby Bay Bridge , which spans from San Francisco to Oakland , do not have the same draw . Natural landmarks , such as Niagara Falls and Mount Fuji 's “ Suicide Forest ” in Japan , have also developed notoriety as places people go to end their lives , but studies have shown fewer numbers of successful attempts .
One study noted that the total number of known suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge was more than 1,300 by the late 2000s but estimated that with some bodies washed out to sea and mysterious cars left unclaimed in nearby parking lots , the actual number might be closer to 2,000 .
Clemens says that discussions in previous eras about adding a barrier were stalled in part because officials insisted that any added structure would have to stop suicides completely . Though they still hope that will be the case , the “ 100 % ” criteria has gone by the wayside , as attitudes toward suicide have shifted , they say : “ People see it now as a public health issue. ” Over the years , the bridge authority has increased the number of trained officers patrolling the bridge , where signs already encourage people to phone or text for help if they feel they 're in a crisis .
The Golden Gate Bridge remains one of the country 's most popular landmarks . The span has been crossed by more than 2 billion vehicles since the opening 80 years ago . More than 10 million people visit the bridge each year , about double the number that visit the Grand Canyon . Some local tourism sites brag that it is the most photographed human-made structure in the world .
The fact that its looks will be changed – though with an eye to “ minimal visual impact ” – has been a top design consideration as authorities spent years working on the project . Previous suggestions that a fence be built along its edges were scrapped as people complained that it would mar the site and ruin the view . Though the steel was originally planned to be painted the same rusty orange as the bridge , designers discovered that leaving the stainless steel untouched actually did more to minimize distraction , helping the net blend in with the water below .
“ It 's hard to say why people have chosen this place , ” says Clemens , suggesting that the “ mystical ” nature of the bridge on the edge of Pacific Ocean may be part of the draw . But , they say , “ that 's something we 're working to stop . ”

Last night , Houston app developer Jeff Kibuule asked me a somewhat odd question on Twitter :
@ dsilverman Do you find yourself going to websites less because the images are n't retina quality on your new iPad ? — Jeff Kibuule ( @ hitechjeff ) March 27 , 2012
I responded with “ no , not at all ” . It never occurred to me to avoid the Web on my iPad just because the graphics are n't pixel-perfect . I go the Web to get information or communicate with others , and I do n't really care if some of the images have a case of the jaggies on the retina display of the new iPad .
But after digging into some discussions on this topic , I decided to visit a site I knew had added high-resolution graphics for the iPad — Apple 's own website . Sure enough , there 's a remarkable difference in the way the site looks when compared to viewing it on a traditional-resolution display .
Unfortunately , it 's also a much “ heavier ” site . Because the graphics are higher-resolution , their file sizes are bigger , which means they take more time to load . How much bigger ? Ryan Block of gdgt points out :
Preview of the Retina future : “ The total size of [ Apple.com ] goes from 502.90K to 2.13MB with the retina versions of images. ” — Ryan Block ( @ ryan ) March 26 , 2012
Block is drawing from this blog post from startup Cloud Four in which author Jason Grigsby looks at how Apple is serving high-resolution graphics from its site to new iPads that come calling . The bad news : New iPads coming to Apple.com get both regular and retina-resolution images downloaded . That increases load time and , if you 're using LTE on a new iPad , chews up your data allowance for the sake of pretty pictures .
Which is not to say , of course , that pretty pictures are never worth it . There are great websites where the overall experience is paramount , and that includes its visual appeal . While I have yet to visit a site on the new iPad that turns me off because it looks bad , I have seen some things that make me go “ eewww “ . Facebook , for example , is notorious for serving up low-quality versions of pictures , and there are some pages there in which photos look ghastly on a new iPad . Now , there may be other reasons to avoid Facebook , but pixilated pictures is n't one of them . ( To be fair , Facebook is taking steps to improve the way it displays images . )
The new iPad 's display has already caused concern about the size of apps which now must incorporate higher-resolution graphic components . That 's caused apps to balloon in size , and if you have a lot of them on your iOS device , they can require significantly more storage . And because many apps are universal – there 's one file for both iPhone/iPod and iPad devices – it affects all users of those apps , not just iPad owners .
You might figure that the relatively low number of new iPads means site operators wo n't have to worry about serving higher-resolution images for a while . But Apple sells a huge number of these – the company sold more than 15 million in the last quarter of 2011 – and they 'll quickly ramp up . In addition , competitors will launch retina-quality tablets of their own , and while they likely wo n't hit the iPad 's sales numbers for a while , they 'll still add to the population of tablets with retina capabilities . Note that Windows 8 , which has an interface designed for tablets , will have full retina display support when it launches later this year .
I suspect that , by the end of 2012 , every website operator will be struggling with the decision about whether to improve the quality of graphics and pictures on their sites .
Sites can be configured to determine the technology being used by the devices requesting information from them , and serving images accordingly . That means people surfing the Web with displays that ca n't benefit from high-resolution displays wo n't be served those bigger files . But those who are using retina displays will see a slower Web as pages take time to load bigger graphics .
Unfortunately , sites ca n't determine whether a device is using cellular broadband or Wi-Fi , which means those coming to sites with retina-capable displays on tiered and capped data plans are going to be using up a lot more of their data allowances . A better-looking Web could end up being a more costly Web , as well .
That will also be true for site operators , who often pay their Internet providers based on the amount of data they serve .
Is a better-looking Web worth the trade-off to you ? As displays improve , are you willing to put up with slower page loads or faster depletion of your monthly data allowance ? Let us know in the comments .
Stephen King once said a novel is a love affair , while a short story is a kiss in the dark . Hey , I 'll buy it . Novels are work . Commitments . Contracts in good faith . Often , intimate and soul-enriching partnerships . But they 're not without their trappings .
For one , they can go on longer than they should . They can be clunky in places . Rigid in their approach . Forceful , even . And while novels have the ability to whisk us off to new and fully-formed worlds , alongside fully-formed characters , there can be disagreements with where the narrative should be heading , or how things should turn out . At their most comprehensive , novels can make too many choices on our behalf , or reduce the celestial realm of imagination to a single , absolute conclusion .
It should be of no surprise then that , when it comes to speculative fiction—fiction of the weird , of the physically and metaphysically flexible—the short story may just be the perfect medium . It 's a peck in the dark for the recklessly imaginative , often providing something more precious and affecting than the mechanics of plots and resolution . In its ability to puncture little more than a peephole in the veil of reality , a good short story can provide not only a glimpse of an unfinished image , but conjure up the lingering and hopeful sense of infinite possibility .
Here are five short story collections that know just what I mean .
The Panic Hand : Stories by Jonathan Carroll
One of the most underrated magic realist authors of the past three decades , Jonathan Carroll ( no relation to Lewis ) has proven time and time again that the contemporary world may just be stranger and more flexible than any of us are letting on . Fresh , witty and quietly insightful , this master of “ kitchen sink fantasy ” breaks and restructures all the rules of common logic with a collection guaranteed to pop a neuron or two . I 've never been quite the same since picking up “ The Panic Hand ” almost twenty years ago now .
Grimscribe : Their Lives and Works by Thomas Ligotti
While it was their debut collection Songs of a Dead Dreamer that launched Ligotti into the limelight , inviting apt critical comparisons to the works of H.P . Lovecraft ( minus the racial hullabaloo ) , it was their confident and creepy-as-hell second offering Grimscribe that solidified their status as the spokesperson for intellectual pessimism and the modern master of philosophical horror . It 's no wonder Nic Pizzolatto , creator of the hit show True Detective , has cited Ligotti as one of their greatest influences .
Blind Willow , Sleeping Woman by Haruki Murakami
Mr. Murakami has been dazzling us for years in fiction both long and short . And while he 's pulled off a full-blown spectacle or two in tomes like The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle ( loved ) and 1Q84 ( not so much ) , it 's in their short fiction collections that we get to wander the grand halls and myriad rooms of their palatial imagination . From a monkey that steals names to a woman recounting their relationship with a man literally made of ice , prepare to be both entertained and confounded , but never less than mesmerised .
Fragile Things : Short Fictions and Wonders by Neil Gaiman
Mr. Gaiman 's neither short of fans nor fame , but few can deny the plethora of small literary miracles the author pulls off to a seemingly inexhaustive degree . You could find yourself preferring their big , doorstopper adult novels like American Gods , tending towards their leaner ( and often meaner ) novels for kids and young adults , or simply loving everything the man puts to print , but it 's in their short story collections where the full spectrum of their wit , imagination and dexterity gets to go on show . Although they have released a number of excellent collections , for my money , Fragile Things is the crème ( possibly only because it was the first I 'd picked up ) , a generous and spirited offering of all things weird , wonderful and WTF .
Silence by Rodney Hall
There 's really no way to box this one in . It is n't directly speculative in any of the ways we 've come to understand this new sort-of genre , and some of the tales are so short they may cause more frustration than imagination . Halfway through this paradoxical meditation on silence itself , however , one ca n't help but think the author has their own secret entrance to alternate realities beneath their writing desk , introducing us to places as mundane and familiar as they are fragile and uncanny . You wo n't be able to put your finger on the method behind their unique brand of hypnosis , and as far as I 'm concerned , that makes it a trip .
Fred Strydom studied film and media at the University of Cape Town . They have taught English in South Korea and has published a number of short stories . They currently work as a television writer and producer in Johannesburg , where they live with their wife , three dogs , cat , and horse . The Raft is their first novel .
The Nobel may be Sweden 's most famous prize , but the Retzius medal is also quite an honor .
Every three years on April 24th , the anniversary of the Swedish-Finnish geographic explorer Nils Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld 's return with their ship Vega to Stockholm , the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography ( SAAG ) bestows the Anders Retzius gold medal on a scholar they believe has made a significant scientific contribution to anthropology . In the intervening years , a physical and a human geographer are recognized .
Previous recipients of this honor include Frederik Barth ( 1988 ) , David Harvey ( 1989 ) , Veena Das ( 1995 ) , Sherry Ortner ( 2001 ) , Doreen Massey ( 2003 ) John and Jean Comaroff ( 2007 ) and Ulf Hannerz ( 2010 ) among a slew of others .
That the award this year goes to Paul Stoller is particularly noteworthy because their work is somewhat outside the mainstream of anthropology . Their response to the official notification was rather typical of their well-known humility and consistent optimism in the discipline . They said , `` The notification came as a complete shock . The process of deliberation is secret ... Aside from the shock , it feels wonderful to have my contributions recognized . My own feeling has been that my work has been on the margins of an anthropology that has n't put a premium on storytelling and narrative and how they bring us to the center of what matters existentially in social life . Perhaps this award means that the discipline is taking the narrative dimension more seriously than in years past . ''

Stoller , Professor of anthropology at West Chester University in Pennsylvania , has conducted extensive field research on religion and magic in Niger and Mali as well as among African immigrants in New York City . An expert and leading thinker in the fields of economic , reflexive and visual anthropology and anthropology of the senses , they are the author of eleven books spanning from ethnographies and biographies to memoirs and novels that include In Sorcery 's Shadow ( with Cheryl Olkes ) , The Taste of Ethnographic Things , Embodying Colonial Memories , The Cinematic Griot , Jaguar : A Story of Africans in America , Stranger in the Village of the Sick , Money Has No Smell among others , and too many refereed articles to count . They are also a most prolific HuffPo blogger . During their thirty years in anthropology , Stoller has always experimented with writing , believing there is no single way to write about the human experience .
On Tuesday , they received the medal from Their Majesty King Carl Gustav of Sweden . Yesterday 's VEGA day festivities included a symposium on `` anthropology and well-being '' the theme they chose inspired by Yaya 's Story : The Quest for Well Being in the World , their latest and recently completed book . Contemplating this decision , they noted , `` it is surprising to me that anthropologists have paid so little direct attention to the issue of well being , something that is of universal concern . So I wanted the symposium participants to reflect on the notions and practices of well being . '' To that end , Stoller invited fellow anthropologists , David Napier ( University College London ) , Kirin Narayan ( University of Wisconssin-Madison ) and Helena Wulff ( Stockholm University ) to speak on this issue . They say , they `` have been thinking and writing about well-being for a very long time and have wise things to say about the matter . '' The chair of the symposium was Uppsala University 's , Sten Hagberg .
Considering the bad rap the discipline has received lately ( as the worst possible major for the future ) , I could not help asking Paul to reflect on the significance of this recognition in these times . They had this to say :
Anthropology will continue to get a bad rap as long as we anthropologists think and write about the human condition in obtuse ways . When I talk about my life in anthropology and the people I have come to know and love over the years , I find people in the audience moved -- not because what I had to say was particularly brilliant , but because I opened my experience -- my joy and pain and that of my Nigerian friends -- to them and such an opening established a connection . At my last several talks , I have seen people shed a tear to two when I talk about the depth of my ethnographic experience and the depth of the humanity of my Nigerian friends . That kind of connect is usually missing in anthropological accounts . In my view of things , this connects should be the centerpiece of what we do .
In response to the tendency to measure the discipline 's value in terms of the market , Paul remained as frank : `` I 'm not sure how anthropology fits into the contemporary market economy . But I do know that if we do n't pay heed to what anthropological knowledge can teach us , it impoverishes social life and social relations , making us less able to find a measure of well-being in life , less able to be comfortable in our skins . ''
Decades ago , I came across their work by way of my doctoral advisor , Ruth Behar . It was n't until years later however that their intellectual influence began to take hold as I started to confront the limits of one form ( ethnography ) and began to explore then embrace another ( performance ) . In the last few years , we have had conversations about the significance of anthropology , doing work that matters while maneuvering the boundaries of the discipline . I remain curious about the centrality of Stoller 's interest in West Africa and how they manage to maintain this connection . They said , `` I have been dedicated to Niger for a very long time . The reason for this long-term commitment is simple : I fell in love with Niger and the people I met there . My work is quite frankly a measure of that love , and the depth of my experience there of love and loss , courage and fear , fidelity and betrayal -- the real of stuff of human relations . ''
Understanding human relations may have low market value in the vocational push trending in contemporary education but anthropology still matters if for no other reason than the fact that the discipline continues to unravel the complexity of the fictive distance that has historically and socially limited us as a species . Evidence of this could not be more apparent than in the medal 's namesake Anders Retzius , an anatomist and anthropologist . Retzius was a polygenist whose work and that of their forbearers was foundational to scientific racism . Indeed , anthropology has changed and certainly will continue to do so in ways that have significant impact upon the world .

A Calgary woman says she 's heartbroken after someone broke into their truck , grabbed a bag containing their daughter 's ashes and dumped them on the road .
Colleen Ransom has kept their daughter Emma Ransom 's ashes in a green pouch inside their vehicle ever since the 19-year-old died in a 2009 car crash , along with two other young girls .
On Aug. 2 , someone entered Ransom 's parked truck , took the pouch and a green raincoat that belonged to Emma .
Emma 's ashes were dumped on the street a short distance away . Most of the remains were soaked by rain , but Ransom managed to scoop up some of the ashes .
Several other vehicles in the area were also broken into that night .
“ I do n't think they realize how impactful it is to the people that they are breaking into , ” Ransom told reporters .
“ They probably just think it 's a thrill to break into someone 's vehicle . ”
Ransom is asking the thieves to at least return their daughter 's raincoat . Along with the ashes , it is one of the few reminders of Emma they have left .
“ They 're the only thing I have left of my daughter and I like them to come with me wherever I go , ” Ransom said .
Calgary Police are now searching for three teenage girls who were seen in the neighbourhood at the time of the break-ins .
“ It 's despicable from my personal opinion , of course , ” said acting Sgt . Lee Stanton . “ Simply because the woman has been victimized a second time . ”

At 1 p.m. Tuesday , the Board of El Paso County Commissioners will take up two proposals relating to Amendment 64 , the legalization of marijuana for recreational use as approved by statewide voters in November .
24oranges.nl 's photostream
Commissioners want to ban commercial and retail cannabis operations .
The commission wants to ban marijuana possession , display and use from county property in a resolution that finds such a ban is in the `` best interest of the public safety , health and welfare . ''
A related ordinance also up for consideration on Tuesday goes further , banning the cultivation and sale of marijuana in the unincorporated portion of the county , arguing that :
The Board of County Commissioners of El Paso County ( “ Board ” ) finds that the licensing and operation of marijuana establishments provided for in Amendment 64 , by making marijuana more readily available in the community and facilitating the recreational use of marijuana , presents a threat to the health and education of El Paso County 's children , to the safety of the workplace and the travelling public and to the public health , safety and welfare as a whole .
Under provisions of the ordinance , the ban would become effective Feb. 15 , after duly required votes and publications .
Colorado Springs City Council members have expressed a desire to enact similar bans .
Comcast 's customer satisfaction score for subscription TV service fell 6 percent in a new survey , putting the company near the bottom of rankings published by the American Customer Satisfaction Index ( ACSI ) .
Comcast 's score fell from 62 to 58 on ACSI 's 100-point scale , a drop of more than 6 percent between 2016 and 2017 . The ACSI 's 2017 report on telecommunications released this week attributed the decrease to “ price hikes for Xfinity ( Comcast ) subscriptions . ”
Satisfaction with pay-TV providers dropped industry-wide , tying the segment with Internet service ( a product offered by the same companies ) for last place in the ACSI 's rankings . The ACSI summarized the trend as follows :
Customer satisfaction with subscription television service slips 1.5 percent to 64 , tied with Internet service providers for last place among 43 industries tracked by the ACSI . Many of the same large companies offer service for Internet , television , and voice via bundling . The threat of competition from streaming services has done little to spur improvement for pay TV . Customer service remains poor , and cord-cutting continues to accelerate . More than half a million subscribers defected from cable and satellite TV providers during the first quarter of 2017—the largest loss in the history of the industry . Customers still prefer fiber optic and satellite to cable , putting FiOS ( Verizon Communications ) in first place with a 1 percent uptick to 71 . AT & T takes the next two spots with its fiber optic and satellite services .
The ACSI tracks more than 300 companies , interviewing 180,000 customers each year . The average score is 76.8 , about 20 percent higher than the TV and home Internet industries . Click here for a list of all industries that rank better than cable TV and Internet providers .
Comcast has blamed price increases on things it does n't control , namely the amount it must pay for programming . But no other company in the survey saw as big a decline in customer satisfaction with pay-TV , and most of the major ones were able to increase their scores . Verizon and AT & T put up the highest scores , while Comcast was second to last , ahead of Mediacom .
These charts show satisfaction scores for individual companies and for industry-wide benchmarks such as picture quality and the ease of understanding bills ( ACSI notes that `` very few elements of the customer experience have improved '' ) :
Comcast is facing a lawsuit from customers over rising “ Broadcast TV ” and “ Regional Sports ” fees that Comcast says it uses to recover the costs of programming . These fees push the actual prices customers pay above the advertised rates . Comcast is the largest cable and broadband company in the US .
Comcast rises in broadband while TWC drops
By contrast , Comcast 's score improved on the broadband side of its business , rising from 59 to 60 , ranking 8th out of 11 services that were big enough to have their scores broken out in the rankings :
“ Customer service aside , subscribers like fast Internet access , and Comcast has increased Internet speed 16 times over the past 14 years , ” the ACSI report said . Comcast has also been trying to improve customer service for years after facing extensive criticism from subscribers and US lawmakers .
Many US customers are still stuck with slower speeds and no option to switch to higher-speed providers .
`` Data-rich video accounts for more than half of all Internet traffic , but ISPs are falling short of providing higher-capacity networks at an affordable price , '' the ACSI said . `` Competition is limited across most of the country , and customers are unhappy to be locked into service contracts when prices rise . Service is still largely considered to be slow and unreliable . ''
Charter , the second biggest cable company , provides an interesting case because the ACSI is tracking the pre-merger “ Spectrum ” service separately from the former Time Warner Cable ( TWC ) territory that Charter acquired in May 2016 .
Charter was able to raise its TV satisfaction scores for both Spectrum and Time Warner Cable , and it raised Spectrum 's Internet satisfaction score . But TWC customers have gotten less satisfied with Internet service : the TWC score dropped from 66 to 62 , putting it ahead of Comcast but behind most other major Internet service providers .
We 've contacted both Comcast and Charter about their scores and will update this story if we get responses .
Charter is also facing a lawsuit over broadcast TV and sports fees . Former TWC video subscribers have been leaving the company in significant numbers after being hit with price increases .
On the Internet side , Charter is facing a lawsuit from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who accuses the TWC subsidiary of “ conducting a deliberate scheme to defraud and mislead New Yorkers by promising Internet service that they knew they could not deliver . ”
Charter has promised network improvements , but speed increases planned by TWC before the merger have reportedly been slow in coming .
Mobile customers benefit from competition
Mobile carriers performed much better than cable TV and home broadband companies . Industry-wide , wireless phone satisfaction scores rose from 71 to 73 from 2016 to 2017 , with TracFone Wireless leading the way at 77 . Verizon Wireless led the four major carriers , with an increase from 71 to 74 . Sprint rose from 70 to 73 , T-Mobile USA dropped from 74 to 73 , and AT & T improved from 71 to 72 .
`` Customer satisfaction with wireless telephone service climbs 2.8 percent to 73 , as carriers engage in increasingly competitive price wars , '' the ACSI said . `` Compared with other telecom categories where customers have little choice , the wireless industry is a good example of how competition impacts customer satisfaction . When companies fight for customers , prices are competitive , service improves , and customer satisfaction is higher . ''
Disclosure : The Advance/Newhouse Partnership , which owns about 13 percent of Charter , is part of Advance Publications . Advance Publications owns Condé Nast , which owns Ars Technica .
U.S. Appeals Court : OK to check DNA of those arrested
A closely divided 3rd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals has found that the collection of DNA samples from people arrested -- but not yet convicted -- of crimes is constitutional , in an opinion released today .
In a precedent-setting ruling , the appeals court rejected U.S. District Judge David S. Cercone 's 2009 order finding that law enforcement could not collect DNA from Ruben Mitchell , who faces a federal charge of attempting to possess and distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine . Judge Cercone had found that requiring pre-trial detainees to submit DNA samples , which is done under the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 , violates the 4th Amendment 's search and seizure rules .
In an 8-6 ruling , the circuit judges found that people who are arrested have `` a diminished expectation of privacy in their identities . '' Outweighing their privacy , they found , is the importance to law enforcement of correctly identifying people who are charged with crimes , determining their criminal history , potentially linking them to unsolved crimes and promptly ruling out involvement in a crime in cases in which the DNA does not match that found at the scene .
The majority opinion , by Judge Julio M. Fuentes , said that DNA matching `` promptly clears thousands of potential suspects . ''
`` In sum , under the totality of the circumstances , given arrestees ' and pretrial detainees ' diminished expectations of privacy in their identities and the Government 's legitimate interests in the collection of DNA from these individuals , we conclude that such collection is reasonable and does not violate the Fourth Amendment , '' Judge Fuentes wrote .
Judge Marjorie O. Rendell wrote for six dissenting judges who found that the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 overreached .
`` The privacy interests of arrestees , while diminished in certain , very circumscribed situations , are not so weak as to permit the Government to intrude into their bodies and extract the highly sensitive information coded in their genes , '' Judge Rendell wrote . `` Moreover , the Government 's asserted interest in this case -- the law enforcement objective of obtaining evidence to assist in the prosecution of past and future crimes -- presents precisely the potential for abuse the Fourth Amendment was designed to guard against .

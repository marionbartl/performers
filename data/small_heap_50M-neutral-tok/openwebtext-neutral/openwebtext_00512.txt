Researchers have discovered that increased rates of sleep apnea and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) in first responders to the U.S. World Trade Center attacks on November 11 , 2001 , are resulting in an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease .
The preliminary findings for two studies assessing cardiovascular disease risk among 9/11 first responders were presented at the American Heart Association 's 2014 Scientific Sessions in San Francisco , CA .
Cardiologist Dr. Mary Ann McLaughlin , a principle investigator for the WTC-CHEST Program at Mount Sinai , presented the results of the two studies on Friday , explaining to their peers that exposure to a massive dust cloud containing high levels of smoke , glass fibers , and cement and heavy metal dust at Ground Zero resulted in increased chances of developing obstructive sleep apnea among 9/11 first responders . The psychological impact of that tragic day also resulted increased risk of developing PTSD among emergency crews .

`` As a result , this puts our 9/11 first responders at higher risk of developing heart disease , '' McLaughlin said during their presentation .
To determine this , research teams studied more than 800 participants who had been exposed to the initial conditions of Ground Zero when first responding to the 9/11 terrorist attacks . According to McLaughlin , the researchers took into account the time of arrival of each responder , as well as duration of exposure to Ground Zero air conditions .
According to McLaughlin , the studies found conclusive evidence that elevated levels of Ground Zero exposure resulted in a correlative increased chance of developing sleep apnea -- a well-known contributor to an increased risk of heart disease .
Another findings showed that rescuers positively diagnosed with PTSD had elevated biomarkers for an increased risk of cardiovascular disease .
The full details of these findings are slated to be published in scientific peer-review journals at a later date , and until that point , any reported findings should be viewed as preliminary .
A press release concerning details of the presentation was published on March 20 .

AS MY last posting noted , the first edgy thing which the new Greek government did was to downgrade , albeit very politely , its relations with the church . The second thing was to upgrade a relationship whose historic roots are at least partly religious , with Russia . On their first day in office , prime minister Alexis Tsipras met the Russian ambassador , and then distanced Greece from an EU statement which protested over Russian actions in Ukraine and threatened further sanctions . They then named a foreign minister , Nikos Kotzias , who enjoys cordial relations with the religious-nationalist segment of the Russian elite .
Lots of questions arise . Is this a great historical paradox - the consolidation of a sentimental tie based on common Orthodox Christianity , under a secular Greek government and a stridently pious Russian one ? That would be an interesting reversal of the cold war . Or is the relationship more cultural and historical , based on common memories of shimmering mosaics and swirling incense , rather than actively religious ? If that is true , then it is not particularly dependent on what people on either side now believe .

The idea of an Orthodox Christian alliance in geopolitics became fashionable in the 1990s , when the late Professor Sam Huntington propounded their `` Clash of Civilisations '' theory . They argued that one pole in world affairs would be an eastern-Christian bloc , linking Russia , Serbia and Greece . War was raging in former Yugoslavia at the time , and pro-Serbian sentiment was abundant in Greece , both among Orthodox bishops and anti-American Marxists . That made the theory more plausible . But the fashion for Orthodox geopolitics died down when the Balkans as a whole were drawn closer to the Western orbit and Greece enjoyed a burst of euro-fueled prosperity . Now of course that process has gone into reverse .
As a theory of modern history , it 's easy to pick holes in Huntington 's idea . Greece has indeed fought wars in alliance with Orthodox Serbia , but also quite a few against Orthodox Bulgaria . Tsarist Russia was sometimes in alliance with the Greeks , who gratefully recalled a prophecy that `` a blond race of the same religion '' would liberate them , but there were also periods of bitter rivalry . For the first few years of the 20th century , the Greek elite saw friendship with the Ottoman empire ( which they hoped to Hellenise from within ) as the best antidote to Slavic expansion . In the early 1950s , two historically important authorities in the Orthodox world , the Patriarchates of Constantinople and Moscow , were on opposite sides of the cold war . In more recent times , Orthodox Russians have clashed with no less Orthodox Georgians , Ukrainians and Moldovans . And Orthodox Georgia gets on better diplomatically with Muslim Azerbaijan than with eastern-Christian Armenia ; Armenia gets on fairly well with Iran .
So there is no basis for religious determinism in diplomatic history . This much can be said ; when the diplomatic stars are aligned , common cultural and spiritual reference points can give added resonance to a relationship . But such links are not necessarily exclusive . The religious-nationalist thinking personified by the Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin , a friend of the new Greek foreign minister , can in certain moods stress Orthodox Christian solidarity and in other moods seek friends in the world of Islam . The only fixed point , for Mr Dugin , is opposition to the West and liberal democracy .

Know all the things ? No way ! Here 's the important stuff .
How many software developers are there ? Millions ! And , I 'm guessing you are one if you are reading this . Well , the tricky part about picking five things to focus on is that there are so many different kinds of you working on so many different projects , from mobile apps , to killer databases and IOT gadgets , to large infrastructure . What you 'll read here is my take on the things that are changing what it means to be a part of software development . Enjoy the following and let me know what else you think is going to be important in 2016 .
1 . Versatile and modular architectures gain momentum
Dare I ask , have you heard of microservices ? ( If not , Martin Fowler breaks it down for you . ) Some folks think that it 's just a new name for service-oriented architectures ( not I ) . No longer must software architectures be monolithic structures that need to be patched and built onto at your peril . Microservices break your architecture down into smaller , independent applications that can be continuously upgraded , switched out , and optimized . For instance , when one piece of your system is being taxed , you can focus on shoring up its performance while the other pieces chill out . Now , microservices are not the answer in every case . I expect the monolith to be around for a long time , as it can be the right approach . But this year , it is very much worth your time to check out if microservices make sense for your company .
Check out Building Microservices and The Principles of Microservices for some guidance from Sam Newman or if you are just starting out , come to Mark Richards ' Software Architecture : From Developer to Architect Training .
2 . The continuous delivery and deployment revolution continues
Some people believe that microservices are the first 'DevOps ' architecture . I agree , but the revolution of DevOps goes far beyond a new architecture . It has been and will continue to be a game-changer for everyone who develops software , from system administrators to software engineers . From Chef to Kubernetes , a bevy of new tools to release , monitor , and optimize software apps has landed . And , if shipping software early and often is the new normal , then everyone from the team leader to the release engineer is affected . In fact , the line between development and operations has effectively been smudged beyond recognition . In my view , this is all great news—software does n't have to be static , it can continue to improve ( and is even expected to ) and there is an infrastructure in place to make it so . What used to be a buzzword—DevOps—is now a reality , albeit one that is still being tuned and refined . If you have n't already , look into what this means for how your team is structured and how you can pick the best tools for you .
Check out Effective DevOps , Kubernetes : Up and Running , and Programming for SysAdmins .
3 . Software development influences the entire company
Software developers do so much more than develop software . They can be responsible for many things :
Understanding customer needs
Generating revenue via app sales
Creating the face of the company via a website
Facilitating delivery of content to millions of individuals
Keeping identities safe
Making sure hardware works every time
I could go on , but the point I 'm making here is not that you are the center of the world , but that your work is central to pretty much everything your organization does . Creating software of any kind goes far beyond making sure the perfect Python code gets written ( though that 's critical ! ) . It means crafting a product that solves a problem , answers a need , or facilitates a service . Understanding and contributing to the design , development , and deployment of software that truly succeeds for users is much more involved and powerful than simply writing code . Step up to that leadership position this year .
Check out Hello , Startup and Beyond Blame for insight beyond coding .
4 . The care and feeding of sustainable open source projects
Something I 'll be thinking a lot about this year is—what happens now that open source has become ubiquitous ? Almost all software languages , frameworks , etc . are open source , so do we just let up on the gas ? After speaking with people who 've been with open source since the beginning , as well as those new to it , it 's clear that we ca n't just say `` Mission Accomplished . '' We need to continue to nourish this community , define how both individuals and enterprises can best contribute and collaborate , and respond to changes in the technology environment that impact how open source software is developed and maintained .
Check out these free reports as a starting place for some good debate .
5 . Keep a good balance—The New Shiny vs . Tried and True
Here at O'Reilly we get very excited and carried away at times , frankly , with `` The New Shiny . '' The idea of an emerging language , to me , is just so cool . I think about how it reflects the world of programming today like Java and others never could .
On the flip side , I love to think about how developers deal with legacy software : when to upgrade ; considering if the COBOL code is ok as is ; etc . I was talking with someone recently who said that NASA uses older software architecture because , when you are drifting past Pluto you either work or you don't—and well , we now have great pictures of Pluto . My point here—we will always have lots of `` New Shiny '' techniques , frameworks , languages , etc. , but do n't forget about the old standbys and how they can solve your problems just as well , if not better , at times .
Dan McKinley participated in an online conference we did this past summer where they speak to this point very well with `` Choose Boring Technology '' —take a listen .
Rutherford County Schools said a substitute teacher will no longer be working in the school district after they were accused of posting “ inappropriate , threatening ” comments on social media regarding President Donald Trump .
Rutherford County Schools received several messages about David Colin on Wednesday . Colin is accused of posting on Facebook , “ the only good Trump supporter is a dead Trump supporter , ” on Facebook Nov. 9 at 9:29 a.m .
Colin is not employed by RCS , but is contracted through PESG . The schools said Colin is no longer permitted to work in the district .
The school district has notified PESG about Colin . The contractor indicted that it will conduct an internal investigation of the allegations immediately .
`` Information was presented to us by the school district , '' a PESG spokesperson said . `` We are investigating it . ''
Colin is also accused of writing this on Facebook on Jan. 16 : `` I spent a lot of time today thinking about the state of this mess . There are huge numbers of people that are upset , mad , angry , ( pretty much every negative word ) , but what I have not seen is a plan . Everyone is looking for leadership to start this off , but there is no one carrying the banner . Without that we will all settle in to becoming angry hateful people and there will be no solutions . So , where do we go from here ? Rallies and demonstrations are pretty much futile , since the lunatics just laugh at us knowing we have n't the guts to stand up ad take the actions needed . Writing and complaining falls on deaf ears . Not until the first shot is fired will the recovery begin . ''
Here is the full statement from Rutherford County Schools :
Rutherford County Schools received several messages after hours on Feb. 8 about a substitute teacher who is accused of making inappropriate , threatening comments on social media during the work day .
Rutherford County Schools contracts with PESG to provide substitute teachers , and the school district has notified the contractor that the substitute teacher , David Colin , will not be permitted to work any longer as a substitute in Rutherford County Schools .
PESG has indicated it will conduct an internal investigation of the allegations immediately .
Fox 17 reached out to Colin , who did n't want to go on camera because they say he 's received threats .
Review : Dragon Age : Origins - Awakening By Pete Haas Random Article Blend Dragon Age : Origins are side adventures that add about an hour of gameplay apiece . BioWare 's vision for Dragon Age : Origins - Awakening was much more ambitious , though . It 's a $ 40 expansion pack that continues the main campaign from Origins . While it 's certainly larger and a better bargain than the modules , it does n't avoid the main problem with downloadable content : more is n't always better .
Awakening is set some time after the end of Origins . Your character ( imported from Origins or new ) travels to the region of Amaranthine to assume command of the Grey Wardens ' fortress there . The Darkspawn , the monstrous horde that you faced in Origins , are causing problems once again . You 're tasked with investigating and stopping the new threat while also ruling over Amaranthine .
You discover early on that the Darkspawn have developed the ability to speak since you last encountered them . This addresses one of the most problematic parts of Origins story : it 's tough to make an antagonist compelling if you never get to speak with them . Mindless monsters just do n't have much personality . Thing is , the new talking Darkspawn do n't show much personality , either . The only foot soldiers who can speak are the lieutenants , who tell you ( in their best orc voice ) that the Mother told them to kill you - cue battle . Eventually you do meet this Mother ( as well as another leader ) and the peek at the Darkspawn society and its command structure are interesting but it 's too little , too late . The bulk of the campaign is spent traveling from one end of Amaranthine to the next , wiping out packs of mindless beasts .
The enemies stay about the same and so do your friends . Only one NPC companion returns from Origins ( Oghren , the token drunk dwarf ) but the new recruits fall into the familiar roles : Anders is a cocky mage , Velanna 's a nature-loving elf , and so on . The only companion that really stands out is Justice , a spirit trapped in a human body . He 's the most interesting character in the expansion and one of the few bright spots in the story . I suspect he 'll end up in Dragon Age 2 as well .
Maybe the reason I like the Awakening cast less than Origins 's is because I did n't get a proper chance to know them . Origins allowed you to sit in camp and talk with party members at length . In Awakening , however , most conversations take place in the field . When you walk past a statue of a religious figure , your companion chats with you about it . This means that the characters you get to know more are the ones you actually use in your active party . I suppose that 's `` realistic '' but it ignores the fact that you do n't choose party members based on your interest in their character . You choose them because they fit your strategy preferences . If you play a Rogue who specialized in ranged weapons , you probably wo n't take Nathaniel because he 's got the same skillset . BioWare will argue that seeding the character dialogue opportunities throughout the world like Easter Eggs makes the conversations more `` active . '' Players had full control in Origins over how much they talked to their party members in camp , though , so the risk of getting bored by this dialogue was low . The environmental triggers just seem like an attempt to disguise the fact that your companions have less to say .
The main character 's personal story does n't advance much . If you chose a `` Human Noble '' origin for your character , it adds an interesting dimension to your dialogue with one of the companions but otherwise , your origin stories are a non-factor . Your choices from the Origins campaign have very little weight here . The person you chose to become ruler of Ferelden will make a cursory appearance in the beginning , if only to confirm that you imported the right save file . Your romance from Origins is n't continued and no new love interests await you . By the end of Awakening , you 're pretty much the same guy/girl you were at the start .
While you 're supposed to be the ruler of Vigil 's Keep , you never feel like you 're in charge . It 's a Captain Kirk situation : you pop into headquarters occasionally but spend most of your time running around on adventures . Your leadership amounts to a few fetch quests - the guards want new equipment so if you happen to find any iron ore ( or whatever ) , bring it to the armorer . You 're asked to make a few seemingly big decisions , such as ruling on disputes between subjects , but there are no obvious consequences from these choices . While letting the player run their own keep is a good idea - it was executed really well in Neverwinter Nights 2 - not enough time is devoted to it here to make it feel like anything more than a collection of subquests .
Awakening 's plot is structured like Origins 's : you 're given a small number of large missions you can accomplish in any order you choose and once they 're done , you can begin endgame . Here , you 're investigating a series of darkspawn-related incidents in Amaranthine . One of my main criticisms of Origins in
Most of the enemies you face in these locales are largely the same , too . There are a few new critters seeded within the ranks but they 're dressed up versions of the old ones . The talking Darkspawn lieutenants , for example , look like Skeletor but fight exactly the same as rank-and-file Darkspawn . The armored ogres are a bit tougher than the unarmored ones but they have similar attacks . The only foe that really throws a curve ball at you is the Queen of the Black Marsh , a spectral dragon . Like an MMO boss encounter , the ( optional ) fight against the Queen has different phases so it requires more thought than the standard tank-and-spank encounters . For the rest of Awakening , though , you 'll get by using the same tactics that you used in Origins .
In fact , you 'll do more than `` get by '' - you 'll pretty much wipe the floor with every enemy you encounter . The level cap 's been upped to 35 and there 's plenty of new talents/spells for you to learn and equipment to acquire . The game throws a whole lot of money at you , too , so you 'll never be short on consumables to turn to the tide . Your party gets much stronger but the enemies just do n't keep pace . I remember a lot of lost battles and close calls in Origins but in Awakening , I had maybe four characters die in the entire campaign .
About eight years ago , BioWare released an expansion pack for Baldur 's Gate II called Throne of Bhaal . Like Awakening , it was a high-level adventure but the difference was that Bhaal made you feel high-level . It was n't just a simple matter of giving you more hit points or a slightly shinier weapon . The game made you believe your character was one of the most powerful beings in existence and was fighting against foes who were just as formidable . In many ways , Awakening just fails to do this . If you simply want more Dragon Age , these extra 15 hours of gameplay might sate you . If you were expecting this expansion pack to take the franchise to new heights , though , you 're going to be disappointed .

Known Issues
One of the big trends you should consider in the new year is the change in how people want to work .
The talented people you 're seeking may not want to be part of a static , full-time staff but prefer to be on more fluid , on-demand teams .
Consultant Lisa Hufford notes that we are approaching the point where 40 to 50 per cent of the working population wo n't be in full-time jobs and so firms that continue handling their work through a traditional staffing model will miss out on talent who prefer to be independent .

They have lived this trend herself : A decade ago , after 14 years working in big corporations , including Microsoft , they decided they wanted a different lifestyle that allowed them more control over their schedule to be with their young children and so set themselves up in business .
`` My story is not uncommon – it 's the story of many men and women , '' they say . Many millennials view security not as working for a single employer but in having the control and freedom to concoct their own working arrangements . And many of the people who joined the freelance economy in desperation as corporations downsized are deciding not to return to traditional work forces when new opportunities arise .
`` It 's a major talent shift for big corporations to get things done , '' they say .
We now have to think of who are the best people to accomplish tasks and how best to mingle them . We will increasingly see project teams with some regular staff working alongside free agents assembled for this particular challenge .
In their book , Navigating the Talent Shift , they describe the type of free agents in the workforce :
Independent contractors ( 36 per cent of the independent work force in the United States ) : These are traditional freelancers who do n't have an employer and take on freelance , temporary or supplemental assignments on a project-by-project basis .
Moonlighters ( 25 per cent ) : Individuals with a primary , traditional job with an employer but who also moonlight doing freelance work . An example is a corporate-employed web developer who does projects for non-profits on nights .
Diversified workers ( 26 per cent ) : These people have multiple sources of income from a mix of traditional and freelance work . Somebody might work 20 hours a week at the front desk of a dentist 's office but also drive for Uber or write on a freelance basis .
Temporary workers ( 9 per cent ) : They have a single employer , client , job or contract where their employment status is temporary . An example would be a data entry clerk who is placed by a staffing agency for three months in a company .
Freelance business owners ( 5 per cent ) : They have one or more employees and consider themselves both a freelancer and a business owner .
They find companies considering a broader approach often mess up by rushing to put together a project team without considering carefully the success they seek .
What are the most important elements of the work that needs to be done ? Do n't just think of the final results but also your expectations for 30 , 60 and 90 days so you understand the project rhythm and texture . `` If you can identify that , you can then determine the skills you need for the role and find them , '' they say .
Story continues below advertisement

From there , you must craft a project description specifying what the freelancer will do – the nitty-gritty of the assignment . Base your description on performance – the outcomes you expect – rather than the tasks the individual might undertake . `` You need to focus very specifically on what is expected to get done within a time frame , '' they advise .
As you reach out to contenders , emphasize your company 's values since that might be a determining factor . `` A millennial can do accounting or IT anywhere . Often they decide by the company 's values , '' they say . And you should want people passionate about your industry . You also want to clarify for them how much work is expected to be done on site and when , something companies often fail to delineate , creating friction down the road .
Interviewing will be far more specific than when bringing on regular staff . Focus on what you need and how they did this work in the past . Check cultural fit : Do they work best , for example , in startups or in large , bureaucratic organizations ?
Develop a statement of work with each person you bring on , describing the work to be done , the timeline , and the invoicing schedule . Will the freelancer bill half up front , or monthly , as work is completed , or just at the end ? Again , misperceptions here can reverberate later .
`` You need to think about talent in a holistic way in the new year . It 's not just FTEs . It 's any professional who can help your company succeed , '' they conclude .

WASHINGTON -- A 27-year-old man died after they were found handcuffed in the custody of private police officers in Washington , according to the Metropolitan Police Department , which said Tuesday it was investigating .
D.C. police said officers responded to a report of an `` assault in progress '' on Sunday at a residential building in Southeast Washington . They found the man , identified as Alonzo Smith , in the custody of what city police said were `` special police officers working at the location . '' Special police officers are licensed by the District of Columbia , and city police must sign off on their application for the job .
Smith was found handcuffed , unconscious and not breathing , police said . They were transported to a hospital , where they later died .
Smith self-published a book of poems in 2013 that they said they wrote between the ages of 14 and 22 , starting when they were put in the juvenile justice system . In their author bio , they said they were working in a private school assisting with special needs youth and finishing their social work degree .
`` To dream freely with a life at my own pace , carelessly happy released of my hate , who can say they do n't wish on this star , a star so bright and promising yet so far , '' they wrote in one poem , titled `` The Road . ''
Several of Smith 's colleagues at an alternative school in Virginia took to Facebook to mourn their death . One wrote that Smith was “ one hell of a great worker ” who “ kept the kids smiling , and did their job right . '' Another friend from college wrote that “ very few people ” knew Smith 's past , but everyone believed they were “ destined for greatness . ”
On their Facebook page , Smith was enthusiastic about their work . Pictures show them dressing up for sports day and spirit week . `` I 'm all in for these kids , '' they wrote on Oct. 27 . An earlier post reads , `` I will be at work with my smile and anxious to hear 'Mr . Smith ' from the students . Bless my soul . ''

Commander : “ Flying is an important part of the Thunderbirds mission , but it 's not everything ”
Maj. Darrick B. Lee
Thunderbirds Public Affairs
NELLIS AFB , Nev. — In response to sequestration actions , the Air Force and Air Combat Command officials have canceled aerial demonstration team performances to include the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds past April 1 .
This decision enables ACC to reallocate flying hours to combat readiness training , which will enable more sorties for combat readiness and deployment commitments , ensuring strategic air defense forces are ready to meet the challenges of peacetime air sovereignty and wartime air defense .
The Thunderbirds were scheduled to perform more than 60 demonstrations at 38 locations between March and November , demonstrating the capabilities of Airmen and supporting Air Force recruiting efforts .
Lieutenant Col. Greg Moseley , U.S. Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron commander/leader , said the squadron 's mission will continue , even though the 130-person team will not be travelling after March .
“ Sequestration temporarily limits our ability to travel , but it does n't stop us from reaching out within our community to tell the Air Force story , ” said Moseley . “ We still have an obligation to educate people about our great Air Force and the incredible things our Airmen do . ”
The Thunderbirds will increase focus on engaging local high schools and universities , supporting Air Force recruiting priorities . They also plan to increase support to the 99th Air Base Wing 's community relations program at Nellis AFB . “ We 've always had a robust community relations effort ; until this issue is resolved , we 'll continue to engage the public as best we can , ” Moseley added .
Details about when the team will resume performances after April 1 are unclear . In the meantime , pilots will take every opportunity to train in an effort to maintain their proficiency within the limits of sequestration . Moseley said the intent is to ensure the squadron is ready to resume demonstrations the moment sequestration is rescinded .
I was halfway through drawing the original comic ( pictured in it 's current state below ) when I suddenly went “ wait a minute. ” and did the other one ( above ) instead upon Kristof 's nods of approval .
This week I 've started what feels like half a dozen comics , all of which are still blue lines or got thrown out .
Hey , just so you know . We just opened our online store . There was some fuckery going on with paypal for a bit , but now it 's all up and running ! Even if you are n't going to buy anything I recommend you trawl through the descriptions for the products . Kristof put a bit of effort into making them as amusing as possible .
We 've kept the prices as low as possible . Hardly anything on there at the moment will break a ten dollar note even after postage . And it 's all in NZD as well ! So for you Americans you can get most of the stuff for the same price as a glass bottle of coke . Weird comparison but here in NZ everything is traded in glass coke bottles since England confiscated all our money with the Queen on it .
A TRULY informed diner would choose a restaurant based on the quality of the menu and the chef 's experience . The discerning investor would decide which company to back after studying the business plan and meeting the founders . In reality , people often copy the choices of others . Diners pick the crowded restaurant over the empty one . Investors go with the company that already has multiple backers .

Such bandwagon effects are not necessarily irrational . Often , the buyer knows less about a product than the seller ; the collective wisdom of the crowd can correct for such “ asymmetric information ” . It can also be a way of coping with a surplus of choice : rather than study 100 models of music player , why not assume the market has already figured out the duds ?
The existence of bandwagon behaviour can be hard to prove . A product or an asset usually becomes popular ( or unpopular ) in the first place because it is genuinely superior ( or inferior ) . But some have tried to isolate the self-fulfilling effects of popularity . One 2004 study * by Alan Sorensen , now of the University of Wisconsin , examined accidental omissions from the New York Times bestseller list . By comparing the sales of books that did make the list and unlisted books that should have , the author could isolate the effect of inclusion—a modest boost to first-time authors ' sales . In a 2008 study by Matthew Salganik of Princeton University and Duncan Watts , now at Microsoft Research , participants tricked into believing a song was more popular than it actually was been more likely to download it .
Scholars are now asking whether herd behaviour also prevails in labour markets . Although the number of long-term unemployed in America is coming down ( see left-hand chart above ) , it is still near an all-time high . Such workers may simply be losing out to candidates with more qualifications or experience for the jobs that come open . A more ominous possibility is that long-term unemployment is at least partly self-fulfilling : employers may be reluctant to hire someone others have already passed over .
To find out , Kory Kroft of the University of Toronto , Fabian Lange of McGill University and Matthew Notowidigdo of the University of Chicago devised an experiment in which they applied for 3,000 clerical , administrative , sales and customer-service jobs advertised online by submitting 12,000 fictitious cvs . The submissions were designed so that applicants with similar backgrounds , education and experience went for the same job . The only difference was how long the applicant had been jobless , a period that ranged from no time at all to as much as 36 months .
Creating cover identities worthy of the CIA , the researchers assigned the fictitious applicants local phone numbers bought for the experiment , as well as e-mail addresses . They found that the odds of an applicant being called back by an employer declined steadily as the duration of unemployment rose , from 7.4 % after one month without work down to 4-5 % at the eight-month mark , where the call-back rate stabilised ( see right-hand chart above ) .
These results , the authors say , can not be because employers found some qualitative flaw in the longer-term unemployed that was hidden from outsiders , since the applicants were similar in other respects . Another explanation for long-term unemployment—that people make less effort to find work as their time out of the labour force lengthens—is also not applicable here .
A third possibility is that employers equate lengthening unemployment with atrophying skills and thus falling productivity . But this should be true whether the economy is booming or in recession . The decline in call-back rates was much more pronounced in cities with tight labour markets ; call-back rates changed relatively little when higher unemployment prevailed locally . From this , the authors infer that employers are more likely to overlook a long period of unemployment if overall economic conditions are stacked against candidates .
These results strongly suggest that long-term unemployment is at least partly self-fulfilling . Like patrons who avoid restaurants purely because they are empty , employers were reluctant to hire someone other employers did n't want .
Herd it through the grapevine
Although such bandwagon behaviour may be rational , it can also be deeply harmful . Two decades ago Abhijit Banerjee , now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , devised a model of “ rational herding ” in which market participants base their decision on a combination of their own information and the actions of others . Over successive rounds of transactions , participants responded less to their own information and more to the herd .
That can lead to poor outcomes . Imagine a newly unemployed worker who narrowly misses out on the first job they apply for . That initial failure reduces their odds of landing the second job they apply for , and so on , until they end up as one of the long-term unemployed . The growth of cv-screening software may exacerbate the trend by reducing the chances that someone in human resources will pull the details of a long-term unemployed worker out of the pile of applications . One near miss can increase the odds of protracted failure .
Popularity is not destiny , fortunately . Mr Salganik and Mr Watts could turn an unpopular song into a hit by manipulating its perceived popularity , but could not turn a hit into a loser . Even after being falsely labelled the least popular song , the most popular song rose sharply in the rankings once enough people had listened to it . Similarly , Messrs Kroft , Lange and Notowidigdo found that even someone who has been unemployed for several years has a 4 % chance of a call-back . But their study suggests that taking some work is better than none for the recently unemployed . Once the bandwagon starts to roll , it is hard to stop .

TAOISEACH Leo Varadkar has called on Northern Ireland to take care of Donegal residents after flash floods and thunderstorms caused hundreds of thousands of euros worth of damage on Tuesday night .
About two-thirds of the average rain for August fell in just nine hours , turning roads into rivers and washing away roads and bridges in some of the worst weather the region has seen in over a century , forcing the government to peer out of their summer holidays , briefly .
In an official statement sent to Stormont this morning , the Taoiseach asked whether the British owned territory could ‘ take care of Donegal for the moment ' , as the Irish government is officially on a break , pointing to how close the county is to Northern Ireland anyway .
“ It 's basically your side lawn , ” the document read , accompanied by a diagram of the North with Donegal circled in red biro , “ to be honest , we often forget Donegal is ours down here as it 's that close to you guys . Can we go splitsies , maybe ? It 's an awful big area and a bit far away from Dublin for anyone down here to really care about and I kind of feel bad about the whole thing because it 's quite a disaster up there at the moment and they 're giving out like mad things ” .
So far six major bridges and roads will need to be repaired , including on the busy Moville to Muff road on Inishowen , which could cost the state millions of euros to the ‘ real Irish taxpayer ' , a grievance outlined at the end of the Taoiseach 's letter .
“ We 're looking at the damage reports here and wondering is it even worth building those bridges back up again ? Let me know what ye think ” the Taoiseach 's letter concluded .
The `` Big Book '' is a thought experiment developed by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the nature of ethics and the verifiability of ethical knowledge . This account is given by them in an early work , the 1929 Lecture on Ethics , and it matches also their position given in the early Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus ( Proposition 6.41 ) . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
The experiment [ edit ]
`` No statement of fact can ever be , or imply , a judgment of absolute value . Suppose one of you were an omniscient person and therefore knew all the movements of all the bodies in the world dead or alive and that you also knew all the states of mind of all human beings that ever lived , and suppose you wrote all you knew in a big book , then this book would contain the whole description of the world ; and what I want to say is , that this book would contain nothing that we would call an ethical judgment or anything that would logically imply such a judgment . `` [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Comparison to Wittgenstein 's later positions [ edit ]
Just four years later , in 1933 , in another lecture on ethics at Cambridge University , Wittgenstein seems to have taken up a very different view . Instead of saying that ethical propositions would not be part of a complete account ( or a complete physical account , at least ) of the world , Wittgenstein said in the 1933 lecture that an ethical quality like good should be discoverable like any other quality , and that a full investigation of some action would reveal whether it had this quality or not .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - The most faithful dog in the world , which kept a 14-year vigil at their master 's grave in Edinburgh , Scotland , was nothing but a Victorian business stunt , according to historian Jan Bondeson .
The 140-year-old story of Greyfriars Bobby continues to draw tourists to the graveyard that was once inhabited by the Skye Terrier commemorated by a bronze fountain erected in their memory in the cemetery and immortalised on the silver screen by Walt Disney in a 1961 film .
But Bondeson , a senior lecturer at Cardiff University , claims that Bobby was far from the dependable dog portrayed in the tale of undying Scottish devotion .
They say the story was a fabrication , created by cemetery curator , James Brown , and restaurant owner , John Traill , to drum up custom for local businesses — and that Bobby was a stray mutt , bribed with food to stay in the graveyard .
“ The entire story is wrong —the account of the dog on the drinking fountain who supposedly kept vigil at their master 's grave in all kinds of weather is not accurate . Bobby would go out hunting rats in the church and was kept well fed by the locals . They were not a mourning dog at all — they were a happy little dog , ” Bondeson told Reuters .
The trusty terrier - as the story goes- kept watch over the grave of their beloved master , Edinburgh police officer John Gray , from their death in 1858 until the animal died in 1872 .
However , after studying drawings and contemporary accounts of Bobby while researching their book , “ Amazing Dogs , ” Bondeson also realised that they were looking at two different pooches .
“ I noticed that the two dogs looked quite different . The first Bobby was quite an ugly dog but in later paintings they look just like the statue on the drinking fountain , ” Bondeson said .
The first Bobby , an old mongrel , died in 1867 , leaving Brown and Traill with a problem on their hands , Bondeson said .
“ A dead bobby was no good for business , so they replaced them with a pure-bred Skye terrier who lived for a further five years until 1872 — after which it time did not take long for the fountain to be erected , ” said Bondeson .
- Palm Harbor 's Greg Fusco had two loves , their wife Taylor , whom they married a month ago and playing slow-pitch softball .
“ I moved here from New York in 2006 I do n't think I 've ever not seen them on the softball field , ” said friend James Ellison .
Earlier this month , Fusco was on the mound at a tournament in Nokatee .
In what 's been described as a freak accident : A batted ball came back at them and them - hitting them on the side of the head - before they could react .
After spending weeks at a hospital in Jacksonville , Fusco passed away Sunday .
“ It was devastating to be honest there are quite a few people that they have touched , ” said Ellison .
Friends left their No . 0 behind home plate in Dunedin in their memory . Their name will also live on through the International Slow Pitch Softball Organization .
`` Rule 3.5 . We 're going to call it the Greg Fusco Rule . Pitchers are now required to wear a mask and if they do n't they 're going to have to sign waiver , '' said Commissioner Manuel T. Ferrero , III .
Similar rules will be in place this weekend at a charity tournament in St. Pete benefiting Fusco 's family .
Pitchers will either wear masks or throw from behind a net .
“ I guess God needed another short stop and another pitcher for their team because that 's the only reason we can figure out that they took him , ” Ellison said .

In the wake of the Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado Springs that left three dead and the San Bernardino , California shooting that left 14 dead , there is a renewed focus on gun ownership .
formatted_dad
It 's well-known that gun sales in the United States spike after mass shootings that receive national attention . The two recent shootings are no exception .
This leads some to wonder how many guns , exactly , there are in each state and how many people own guns in each state . The question is n't exactly cut and dried , and varies depending on what study you read .
The latest look at this comes courtesy of CBS News which shows New Mexico has the third-most guns per capita . KRQE-TV , Albuquerque 's CBS affiliate , and KOAT-TV picked up on the report .
The numbers only look at registered guns and uses data from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives on firearm registration and transfer as well as population data from the U.S. Census Bureau .
According to the data , New Mexico has 40.5 guns for every 1,000 residents . That is a total of 84,471 registered firearms according to the ATF among 2,085,287 residents .
That is twice the rate of Alabama , which has the sixth-highest amount of firearms per resident and nearly four times the rate of Florida , which comes in at number 29 among states .
Wyoming has the highest rate of gun ownership , with 195.7 guns per 1,000 residents , followed by Arkansas , with 41.6 guns per 1,000 residents .
The District of Columbia , if it were a state , would slot in at number two , with a rate of 66.4 guns per 1,000 residents .
These numbers , of course , only include legal ownership .
A study in the journal Injury Prevention found that 49.9 percent of New Mexicans own a gun , which would rank New Mexico seventh in the nation . That study looked at gun ownership as of 2013 .
The highest percentage of gun ownership in that study was Alaska , with 61.7 percent . New Mexico 's gun ownership in that study was 15 percentage points higher than the closest neighbor ( Colorado ) and well above the national rate of 29.1 percent .
The General Social Survey , a large-scale poll conducted every two years by NORC at the University of Chicago , found that in 2014 22.4 percent of adults owned firearms nationwide . The study attributed this to the decline in popularity of hunting .
There were no numbers for individual states in that report .
In 2012 , a study found that nationwide , the amount of households with guns fell but that those who already owned guns were purchasing more guns . So even if the percentage of those owning weapons did not increase , the amount of guns per capita would continue raise .
The CBS News analysis differs from one done by The Daily Beast in 2010 , which had New Mexico at 20th in states with most guns per capita . This does n't mean there was a big increase in gun ownership in the state over the past five years , though .
The Daily Beast used state data from the FBI 's National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) over 18 months . However , NICS data would n't capture multiple sales under one check or sales that do n't require a check due to the purchaser being licensed to carry , which would preempt the need for a NICS check .
The Injury Prevention study polled 4,000 adults nationwide using the online service YouGov . The General Social Survey reported on data from 1,711 adults nationwide .
Description Paul Krugman , Laureate of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2008 at a press conference ...
Paul Krugman warns that the ascent of the Democratic Party could be short-lived if they betray their base .
`` The Democrats now look like the natural party of government , '' the Nobel Prize-winning economist wrote in a New York Times blog post on Sunday . `` We 're a diverse nation , ethnically and otherwise , in which a lot of liberal ideas have become perfectly mainstream . ''
But , they added , Democrats could waste this opportunity by caving to the Republican agenda in negotiations with Congress .
`` This newly effective coalition could be shattered if taken for granted , '' Krugman wrote . `` If , say , Obama raises the retirement age in return for vague promises on revenue ( promises that would be betrayed at the first opportunity ) ; if they appoint a deficit scold to a major economic post ; it could all fall apart . ''
The fiscal cliff will be the first major post-election test of whether President Barack Obama will stand firm or cave . The fiscal cliff is a set of $ 1.2 trillion in spending cuts and tax hikes that are scheduled to take place on Jan. 1 if Congress does not agree on a plan to reduce the deficit . It is likely to cause a recession , according to economists .
But they also suggested that one of the reasons they granted an interview about their political future is that they are still bothered about how their first presidential run ended — and they want the respect they said they believe is due to somebody who performed better than more vaunted candidates and who remains popular with many conservatives .
“ Let me show you some polling , ” Mr. Huckabee said , brandishing a two-page memo about a survey their longtime pollster took this month suggesting that they were leading the Republican field in both Iowa and South Carolina . They boasted that such good numbers came at a time when “ nobody has even talked about me being named ” as a candidate .
Mr. Huckabee dismissed the notion that pride was a factor in their decision to float a possible campaign .
“ Anybody who would run for any reason other than to win is an idiot , ” they said . But they quickly warmed to a question about not getting credit for their skepticism about the health of the economy as they campaigned in the months before the 2008 stock market crash and financial meltdown .
“ A lot of things I said that I was sneered at about turned out to be prophetic , ” they said about the criticism they took from fellow Republicans over their focus on the working class during the 2008 campaign . “ A year later I looked like a genius , but nobody ever said , ‘ Huckabee was right , ' ” they said .
They seem intent on running only if they know the experience will be unlike their last run , when they “ was defined by my opponents , ” they said . In that race , they had so little money to live on that they had to leave the campaign to give paid speeches .
Asked if they were financially comfortable enough now to give up their lucrative television job , Mr. Huckabee , who lives in a beachfront home on the Florida Gulf Coast , conceded that this was “ a big issue . ”
“ And it 's why I 'm not in a big hurry to do anything , ” they added .

A closer look at the controversial billboard in downtown Phoenix criticizing President Donald Trump raises questions over whether the design adheres to copyright law .
It features the work of three others , but the billboard artist only has publicly credited one .
Santa Monica , Calif. , artist and activist Karen Fiorito 's billboard went up near Grand Avenue and Taylor Street in downtown Phoenix on March 17 and immediately drew worldwide attention .
Fiorito 's design features a Trump photo from CNN , a mushroom cloud depicting a clown 's face from a German designer , and symbols of dollar signs imitating Nazi swastikas that were designed by Fiorito 's friend .
Fiorito contends their use of the materials is `` fair use '' and appropriate . Fair use is an exception to American law that allows people to use copyrighted material without permission under certain conditions .
Paul Bender , a longtime professor of law at Arizona State University , offered another point of view .
`` If you copy something , that 's copyright infringement unless it 's fair use , '' they said . `` In this situation , there are three main elements and they take them all from other people . The fact that they changed it a little bit does not insulate them from liability . ''
About the design elements
German designer Thomas Mangold designed the `` PS3 Mushroom Clown '' with advertising agency TBWA France for Sony , which used the design as an advertisement for its PlayStation 3 . The ad won three awards at the International ANDY Awards in 2008 .
Their design of a mushroom cloud shaped as a laughing clown is featured twice in Fiorito 's billboard , one on each side of Trump .
Mangold told The Arizona Republic that they own the copyright for the image and that they did not give permission for their design to be used on the billboard .
They declined to comment further on the matter , saying they did not want to be mixed up in a discussion about the artwork .
Fiorito has told multiple news outlets and posted online giving credit to artist Hugh Gran for designing the swastika dollar signs .
Gran confirmed to The Republic that Fiorito asked to use their design for the piece . `` I was happy to say yes , '' they said .
The billboard also features a photo of Trump that was taken by Nigel Parry for CNN .
The Republic contacted Parry , CNN , Sony Interactive Entertainment , PlayStation and TBWA France for comment but did not hear back .
Fiorito : ' I have obeyed every law '
Fiorito told The Republic in an email that their design follows the law .
Karen Fiorito , an artist and activist in California , received a wave of backlash following a political commentary piece they created to stand in downtown Phoenix ( Photo : Karen Fiorito )
`` It is 'fair use ' since Google deemed it 'Use with modification ' with ( sic ) is exactly what I did . I have obeyed every law . ( There are ) no grounds for a suit , especially since we have not made any profit from this project , '' they wrote . They did not reply to further questions .
`` I do n't think that 's going to make it fair use that alone , that she 's not profiting from it , '' Bender said . `` It 's not that all noncommercial things are fair use . It 's got ta be something else , there 's some reason to it , you have to do it in order to make a point you 're making .
`` Like if you 're writing a review of a book , you can copy the book to say what you 're reviewing , '' Bender said . `` Just taking an artist 's work and using it in your billboard ? I do n't think that would be fair use . ''
If any of the involved parties choose to take legal action , there are three possible courses of action : The owners of the design elements could sue Fiorito , file an injunction to have the billboard taken down , or work out a deal to give them permission to use the works , according to Bender .

Bender added that any litigation could be complicated by the fact that the clouds ' copyright owner is in Germany .

The billboard was commissioned by La Melgosa LCC , which is owned by longtime Grand Avenue champions Beatrice Moore and Tony Zahn . Moore said the billboard is on land owned by La Melgosa LLC .
`` There 's a lot of people who want to force us to take the billboard down and they 're trying every avenue they can to do that , '' Moore said .
Moore said they were not involved in Fiorito 's design for the billboard .
`` It 's ironic to me that everybody says 'free speech ' and yet when it 's somebody else 's free speech , then they do n't think that applies . So if you 're going to have free speech , it has to be across the board , '' Moore said .
Fiorito has been the target of harassment and death threats since the billboard went up .
`` It shows what an artist has to go through in order to make a political statement , '' Moore said . `` Also just the importance of standing up and speaking out , and how an artist has to really stand up to some really pretty extreme views and , at times , risk their lives actually to speak up .

IN A speech to London 's Constitutional Club in 1931 , Winston Churchill poured scorn on the idea of India . “ India is a geographical term . It is no more a united nation than the equator , ” they spat , a slur that invites such uniform disagreement from Indians as to disprove itself . Less well known , but more worthy of debate , is the previous line of Churchill 's speech : “ India is no more a political personality than Europe , ” they contended .
The personalities of both India and Europe have changed a great deal since 1931 . But in explaining India to outsiders , Banyan often finds it helpful to compare it to the European Union ( EU ) rather than to the United States . Neither parallel does India justice , of course . The frequent comparisons to America can imbue India with a false cohesion . The less common comparison to the EU suggests a false disunity . But if the two parallels are judiciously combined , the falsities may help to cancel each other out .

One obvious example is Indian politics . This month voters took part in elections for the state legislatures of Punjab and Goa . As is often the case , turnout was higher than in India 's national election in 2014 . In comparison with the United States , where races for national office , especially the presidency , overshadow state-level contests , that is a puzzle . In comparison with the EU , where elections in member states command far more attention than races for the European Parliament , it seems less strange .
The composition of India 's legislature also looks more like Strasbourg 's multicoloured mosaic than Washington 's two-tone Congress . The Lok Sabha , India 's lower house , seats as many as 35 parties . With the exception of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress , few of them have influence beyond one or two states . If America is the benchmark , the obvious question is why India 's voters have failed to coalesce around rival nationwide philosophies of government . But if the template is Europe , the fragmentation is easier to grasp . Few of Europe 's parties could appeal across national lines , however compelling their policies .
Another example is language . India 's constitution lists 22 “ scheduled ” languages . An American might wonder how it copes . But the EU , with 24 official languages , is even more polyglot . India 's national anthem had to be translated into Hindi from the original Bengali . But the EU 's anthem has no official lyrics , so as to leave open the question of what tongue to sing them in . Pick any two Indians at random , and the chance that they share the same mother tongue is less than 20 % , according to data compiled by Romain Wacziarg of the University of California , Los Angeles , and their colleagues . But for the EU as a whole , according to Banyan 's calculations , the odds are less than 10 % . Linguistically , then , India is neither as unified as the United States nor as divided as the EU .
National welding
The author of India 's anthem , Rabindranath Tagore , also saw value in comparing their country to both Europe and America . Like India , the United States faced the problem of “ welding together into one body various races ” . This challenge set both countries apart from Europe , which , Tagore felt , could take its racial unity for granted . Indeed , they saw Europe as one people divided into many states , unlike India 's many peoples “ packed into one geographical receptacle ” .
The gap between India 's many peoples remains large . The GDP per person of Bihar , India 's poorest state , is only a fifth of Haryana 's and little more than a tenth of Goa 's . That is a much bigger income gap than between Mississippi and Massachusetts , but comparable to the gulf between Bulgaria and Belgium .
These gaps have motivated increasing numbers of Indians to move from one part of their geographical receptacle to another . The government 's latest economic survey , written by Arvind Subramanian , its chief economic adviser , calculates that interstate migration nearly doubled between the 1990s and the 2000s , yielding a migrant population of over 55m in 2011 ( roughly 4.5 % of India 's population ) . That may fall well short of American mobility , but compares favourably with the EU , where 13.6m citizens ( 2.7 % of the total population ) live in another member state .
The movement of goods tells a similar tale . In India , unlike America , state prerogatives often trump the imperatives of interstate commerce . Trade is distorted by a patchwork of local levies , which the central government is keen to replace with a new goods and services tax . The familiar sight of lorries queuing at state borders suggests an economy that is hopelessly fragmented . But again , the benchmark matters . Drawing on new data , Mr Subramanian shows that trade among India 's states is now equivalent to about 54 % of GDP , rather higher than many suspected . That is low compared with America ( 78 % ) , but impressive compared with the EU ( 20 % ) .
Net trade is even more dramatic . India 's single market and currency allow some states to run enormous trade deficits with others . Four run deficits in excess of 20 % of local output . That is far greater than the euro area has been able to sustain .
India 's divisions hamper it in its dealings with other nations . Its diplomacy has a reputation for parochialism and mal-coordination—an elephantine inability to “ dance ” . But perhaps it is not given enough slack . Compared with the EU , India 's foreign policy is positively twinkle-toed . India , lest it be forgotten , is as populous as 150 other countries combined . By encompassing all of these people in a single political entity , it dramatically reduces the complexity of global governance—even if it does not always feel like that . Had the republic not succeeded in refuting Churchill , had it disintegrated into multiple sovereign states , the world 's negotiating tables might have needed to accommodate dozens of additional quarrelling players . When the Americans want to talk to India , they know whom to call—however frustrating the conversation sometimes proves to be .
Ukulele review time again ! I have had a few people say to me recently that I am hard on musical instruments at the cheap end of the scale . That really is n't the case , and anyone who reads this blog knows I regularly recommend cheap ukes like the Makala Dolphin . Then the Octopus Soprano came my way - do we have a Dolphin killer ?
To understand my review scoring and see this result in context - visit my review page at
The Octopus retails at under £20 , and puts it slap bang in the minefield territory of ukes - where your chances of getting total junk are high . But it was explained to me that this is a re-issue of an earlier Octopus , and that the brand went back to make several improvements to the instrument whilst retaining a very low price.It 's an all laminate uke , and thick laminate at that , which is not unexpected at this price . But the body is put together remarkably well . It is finished in a satin stain , and the one with me for test is in a rather unattractive brown colour . Thankfully , a look at the full range shows a range of bright colours , some with glittery sparkles so there is bound to be something you will like . But the satin finish feels very nice , and I ca n't find any flaws at all.The bridge looks like rosewood and is a tie bar design , screwed to the top of the uke . The saddle is white plastic . Up to the sound hole and we have a simple rosette design applied as a transfer.And overall it feels solid . The back is flat , and is otherwise a traditional ukulele shape . Looking into the sound hole and it all looks very neat and tidy . I also notice that it is unbraced - something presumably considered unnecessary on account of the thick laminate build . Will this affect the tone and volume ? Moving on to the neck , and we have a three piece wooden neck , with joints at the heel and headstock . Nothing unusual . I really do n't like how much wood there is at the heel which is incredibly chunky . New players may not be troubled with playing that high up the fingerboard , but I noticed it . Thankfully the profile and finish at the lower frets is very nice and makes for comfortable play . When I moved on to the fingerboard however I was quite blown away . The 12 nickel silver frets are finished flawlessly and better than I have seen on ukes costing hundreds of pounds . And the rosewood fingerboard itself is wonderful . On inspection , they have sanded / rolled the fingerboards meaning there are no sharp edges on the wood . That is remarkable and something you will not find unless you spend considerably more . It really is a highlight of the instrument , and far better than the neck and fingerboard on the Makala Dolphin . Far far better.We have fingerboard markers at the 5th , 7th and 10th spaces in inlaid plastic looking pearl . Sadly there are no markers on the side for the player.Past the plastic nut , we have a standard Martin style crown headstock shape and the Octopus logo applied in silk screen or decal in white . I like the dual logos too.The tuners are unbranded silver open gears , and I found one or two of them a little sticky with a bit of grind when turned . That said , they hold just fine . The tuner buttons are also delightful , with a kind of rubberised black coating that makes them feel great.The whole package is completed with a zippered thin gig bag , and strings that may look like Aquila , but are Octopus brand white synthetic gut ( whatever that means ) . What I will say though , is the strings are quick to get in tune and stay there , and feel nice on the fingers with none of the roughness of Aquila brand.So overall I am rather impressed . There are one or two issues , but it feels great to play and that neck is incredible for the money . How does it sound though ? Well - it sounds like a boxy laminate uke , I did n't expect anything else . There is nothing complex about the tone , and it is a little one dimensional . But then so is the Dolphin . I actually think though this has a brighter and a more traditional uke sound than the Dolphin has . I often think that whilst the Dolphin has great volume , it can sound a little muddy . To my ears the Octopus matches the Dolphin for volume , but has a slightly sweeter , more percussive sound . It 's really quite pleasant to both play and listen to for my ears.The setup needs adjusting at the saddle ( hardly a big job ) but otherwise the intonation is pretty damn accurate too.And I really do n't know how they do it for the price ( it 's also quite a bit cheaper than a Dolphin ) . Sure , it 's a cheap uke , and my readers know that I always try to recommend getting something more serious as a first uke , but I appreciate that many people need to stick at this level money wise . And in the contest of the Dolphin vs the Octopus ..... well , the Octopus wins.Read the scores below and take a look at the video review at the end of this review.Looks - 7Fit and Finish - 8Sound - 8.5Value For Money - 10
I am Catholic and uphold the Church 's teachings . There are homosexuals in my school and workplace and there is no discrimination . They eat , work , study , practise just as we do . I am friends with them . Some are even celibate and agree with the Church as well . If you think everyone who opposes homosexual unions is homophobic then that means everybody on earth before a few decades ago was homophobic , which is obviously not true .
There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God 's plan for marriage and family . Marriage is holy , while homosexual acts go against the natural moral law . Homosexual acts “ close the sexual act to the gift of life . They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity . Under no circumstances can they be approved ” . ( 4 )
Sacred Scripture condemns homosexual acts “ as a serious depravity ... ( cf . Rom 1:24-27 ; 1 Cor 6:10 ; 1 Tim 1:10 ) . This judgment of Scripture does not of course permit us to conclude that all those who suffer from this anomaly are personally responsible for it , but it does attest to the fact that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered ” . ( 5 ) This same moral judgment is found in many Christian writers of the first centuries ( 6 ) and is unanimously accepted by Catholic Tradition .
Nonetheless , according to the teaching of the Church , men and women with homosexual tendencies “ must be accepted with respect , compassion and sensitivity . Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided ” . ( 7 ) They are called , like other Christians , to live the virtue of chastity . ( 8 ) The homosexual inclination is however “ objectively disordered ” ( 9 ) and homosexual practices are “ sins gravely contrary to chastity ” . ( 10 )
We 've touched on it before , but to recap : Back in the day when modding your Xbox was a criterion of geekdom , Xbox Media Center was king . Pictures , videos , file streaming , skinning , application launching , script support – you name it , and Xbox Media Center could probably get it done . With its awesome codec support and surprisingly vast functionality , it quickly built up a significant following of fans . Over time , efforts began to bring the application to other platforms , and the project dropped the Xbox association from the name to be redubbed as the XBMC Media Center .
After a few months of public alpha , Team-XBMC yesterday released a Beta version of the application for Mac OS X ( Leopard and Tiger ) , Windows , and Linux in preparation for the stable ‘ Atlantis ' release .
Besides being the first release stable enough to bear the Beta label , XBMC Beta 1 brings a few new goodies to the table . They 've replaced the default “ Project Mayhem 3 ” skin with the new , high resolution “ PM3.HD ” , and added iTunes/iPhoto support to the Mac release . Also , XBMC can now be run without actually being installed via a bootable “ XBMC Live ” CD . And as a bit of bonus news , they 've managed to get it up and running on AppleTVs .
If you 've already got some crazy custom built media center PC running MythTV or SageTV , XBMC might not be enough for you quite yet . That said , if you 're looking to pick up a Mac Mini and set it up with something a bit more big-boy-toys than Front Row , XBMC is a solid option .
Sitting in a brightly lit cafe in east London at the end of their first day in a new job , Victor Spirescu looks up from their plate of chicken and rice with wide eyes as they recall the tumultuous events of the past three weeks .
Within minutes of touching down at Luton airport on New Year 's Day , the 30-year-old , who lived in a small village in rural Romania before flying into the UK to `` work , earn money and go home '' , became the unwitting face of the UK 's latest convulsion over immigration .
Since then they have , in a supreme irony , been forced by frenetic media attention to leave their first job working in a carwash in Bedfordshire – although they have managed to find another this week in east London .
Their private life , including a conviction for assaulting a previous girlfriend , was splashed across the UK newspapers ; they have been photographed with politicians , appeared on television alongside Ukip 's leader Nigel Farage , and been stopped in the street by strangers wanting their autograph . `` I do n't know really what to think about what has happened to me , '' they say . `` It is at the same time a good feeling and a bad feeling . At first it was quite exciting being a kind of celebrity , but afterwards I regret this because I ended up losing my job . ''
At the height of the media frenzy Spirescu , whose new job is in the construction industry , says they were getting more than 50 phone calls a day from journalists . Reporters were turning up at their family 's home in Romania and photographers were posing as customers at the carwash where they worked in an attempt to get new pictures of him .
`` I began to feel so bad , '' says Spirescu . `` They take these pictures and they make me look like the shit man of this country because I come here to work . One photographer came with the car and got it cleaned and then took a picture of me – it was all getting a bit crazy . ''
Spirescu 's journey from a man travelling to a new country in search of work and a fresh start to `` the face of Romanian immigration to the UK '' began as soon as they stepped off the first flight from Romania on 1 January .
Following months of scare stories in the British press about the waves of beggars and benefits cheats waiting for the working restrictions to be lifted on 1 January , journalists and politicians had gathered in the arrivals hall at Luton airport for flight W63701 from Târgu Mures . But it soon became clear that , despite media predictions , the overwhelming majority of the 146 passengers were part of the small established UK Romanian community – many of them professionals returning to their jobs after a Christmas break with their families at home .
So when Spirescu sauntered through with a woolly cap pulled down over their ears and admitted it was their first time in the UK and that they were here to work , they were quickly surrounded by journalists – as well as the chairperson of the home affairs select committee , Keith Vaz .
`` There were television cameras , journalists and this guy Keith Vaz – what was they about ? I had no idea , '' says Spirescu with a rueful smile . `` All I could think is , what is the problem here ? I had just come to work , earn money and go home . I could n't really believe what was happening . ''
Through a friend , Spirescu had arranged work at the carwash in Biggleswade , 40 miles north of London . After a media scrum and quick chat and photo-op with Vaz , during which the pair discussed football and what Victor knew about the UK ( `` soldiers with the big hats and the Queen '' ) , they were taken from the airport on a minibus to start their new life .
But Spirescu 's situation was already very different from that of the millions of economic migrants who move countries in search of work . And although the predicted deluge of people has yet to materialise – this week the Romanian ambassador said there may have been fewer than 30 new arrivals from their country so far – Spirescu said the attention became overwhelming . After two days , they felt they had no option but to leave their job .
`` I was the image for Romanian people and I knew I must make a good image . I was getting too much attention from the media – they were hanging around all the time and making problems for the other people there . I did n't want to make problems for them , so I decided I needed to get away and get a new job . ''
Spirescu packed up their belongings from the house they were sharing and left . Another Romanian offered them a place to sleep for a night , and with help from a friend they found a new job as a construction worker in East London . Spirescu wo n't say exactly where for fear of encouraging more media attention at work .
Just as media interest appeared to have subsided , it was revealed that they had a previous conviction for assaulting a former girlfriend . Spirescu is reluctant to talk about the details , but says they have turned their life around and was shocked that journalists had gone through their private life . `` It is in the past – four years ago . We change . The times change the man . We all change . ''
Spirescu grew up in Bucharest before moving three years ago to the remote village of Pelisor , where they share a small two-bedroom house with their new partner , Catalina , 19 , looking after pigs , chickens and sheep .
As streams of people file past the window of the cafe at the start of the evening rush hour , they admit the move to London has been something of a shock .
`` It is a good place but it is crazy in this town . I see business people here and then over here is 'rasta-man ' . There is so much variety of people . It is so strange to see . '' They say they expected it to be much cleaner in the British capital and does n't like the food because `` it does n't have taste '' .
To emphasise the point , they skewer a bit of chicken on their plate and holds it up with a grin . `` In Romania all the food is good because it is cooked at home and has taste . At home I cut the head off my chicken and I cook it there and then and it tastes very good . ''
Spirescu , who left school at 18 and says they learned English from the television , wants Catalina to join them in the UK and says they will stay probably stay for up to a year before returning home , buying a new car – a Mercedes – and `` enjoying life '' .
They add : `` I want to find a job for their cleaning and with their money we pay the rent and all the food , and mine we save . ''
Despite finding themselves at the centre of a political and media storm , Spirescu remains upbeat . They greet the waiteres in the cafe with a cheery wave and says that now they have a new job , they have few complaints . `` I just come here to work and now I have a good job , so I make money and go home . It is a good feeling , you know , when you have money in your pocket and you can spend it in your country . ''
Their building site job pays £60 a day and they hope that may go up to £80 in a month or so . But they are still on the lookout for better-paid work . `` I want to work in the North Sea , maybe crab fishing or on the big petroleum platforms . I want to make money . ''
Despite their confidence over their future earnings , Spirescu says they only has £5 left until they get their first pay cheque in a couple of days . But as they finish their meal , they seem unfazed . `` If you want to make your dream , you must sometimes take the hard way . It is heavy now , but when the money comes it will be good . I will enjoy my life . ''
Earlier Spirescu had lent their cigarette lighter to another customer in the cafe who said they would bring it back after going outside for a smoke . As they get ready to leave , they realise they have left with theirs lighter .
They shrug their shoulders and laughs : `` And they call us thieves ! ''

I 've lost patience with the widespread whining about Trump .
Trump 's a symptom , not the problem .
Unless we acknowledge and respond to reality there will be many more and worse Trumps to follow .
Lower and middle class citizens around the world are angry for good reasons :
Their incomes have been stagnant or falling despite governments telling them the economy is strong .
Their cost of living for things that matter has been rising despite governments telling them inflation is low .
They see the upper class getting richer and not being punished for crimes .
They carry a high debt load and see that interest rates have nowhere to go but up .
For the first time in a long time they worry that the future may be worse than the present .
They sense that something is broken and that leaders are not speaking the truth .
Their anger has resulted in :
Brexit
Trump
blame of others
extreme parties gaining power around the world
social unrest in many countries
war drums
The economic stresses experienced by many citizens ( and by most countries ) are real and have been caused by the depletion of low-cost oil .
The tricks of increasing debt and lowering interest rates have reached their limits and no longer work to mask the depletion of low-cost oil .
Governments have responded with reckless financial policies that guarantee a high-speed crash into a brick wall .
There is no solution to the depletion of low-cost oil . It is not possible to operate our civilization as currently configured without low-cost oil . There is no substitute for oil .
We need to understand and accept that there will be much less of everything in the future .
We were lucky to witness the peak of human prosperity , and unlucky to witness the beginning of its decline .
No one is to blame . It 's reality .
We need a new story to unite us .
We need new government priorities focused on ensuring the necessities of life are available in the future .
We need to slow down as we approach the brick wall .
We need to stop wasting the precious oil that remains .
We need to get real and vote for wise people who understand what is going on .
We need to break through our inherited denial of reality .
Emmy , it must be owned , found themselves entirely at a loss in the midst of their clavers , and suffered woefully on the one or two occasions on which they were compelled to accept Mrs .
Doyo 's typically edifying piece on the religious who fought Marcos tyranny ( Opinion , 9/21/17 ) , I did not see the name of Igorot Jesuit Bishop Cisco Claver .
Surigao del Norte Governor Sol Matugas announced that they are profoundly inclined of making an official public declaration stating Claver as a municipality free from illegal fishing .
Francis is likely to hold Claver up as a model for todays Catholic Church , someone who insisted on recognizing the inherent human rights of everyone .
Peter Claver , put that message into practice four centuries ago .
The winners , leading voices for justice in their countries , are Kalpona Akter , a former child worker in Bangladesh garment factories who organized fellow garment workers to demand fair labor rights ; Pierre Claver Mbonimpa , who has dedicated their life to denouncing rights violations against prisoners , activists , and people from all social , ethnic , and economic backgrounds in Burundi ; Yonous Muhammadi , who fled the Taliban in Afghanistan , was granted asylum in Greece , and has become a leading defender of refugee rights there ; and Ratnaboli Ray , who is fighting to move India toward a rights-based system of care for people with mental health conditions .
Alexander Claver , Dutch Commerce and Chinese Merchants in Java .
Surigao City - The New People 's Army , armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines ( CPP ) , demanded that the military and police declare a suspension of military operation and suspension of police operation ( SOMO/SOPO ) along the SALASICAM complex located in the municipalities of Gigaquit and Claver , both in Surigao del Norte province .
Claver said yet another recommendation is to create feeder routes to get access to main routes for passengers and creation of space for parking cars for those who take a bus or a light rail service on the main route .
The change would mean that finance minister John Rwangombwa would become head of the National Bank of Rwanda , while the governor of the central bank , Claver Gatete , would become minister of finance .
The two hostages who work for Taganito Mining Corp ( TMC ) in Claver town , Surigao del Norte were released and not harmed by members of the New Peoples Army ( NPA ) .
The Conservatives are keeping secret the draft text of a sweeping free trade agreement Canada is negotiating with a dozen Pacific Rim countries , despite the fact that any U.S. congress member can access the document , the NDP says .
“ If the U.S. can allow its legislators to see the TPP text , there is no reason that Canada ca n't , ” NDP trade critic Don Davies said in a statement .
The latest round of negotiations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) opened in Brunei last week and runs to the end of the month . Canada joined the talks in 2012 after years of lobbying .
If finalized , the deal would create a free trade area that would cover Australia , Brunei , Chile , Japan , Malaysia , Mexico , New Zealand , Peru , Singapore , the United States and Vietnam , along with Canada .
The TPP would cover about 40 percent of global economic output and about one-third of world trade .

11 Things About TPP Harper Does n't Want You To Know 1 / 22
The talks have at times been so secretive that the media completely missed the existence of a recent round of talks in Vancouver , until the Chilean press picked up on it .
“ The TPP is a sweeping agreement covering issues that affect many areas of Canada 's economy and society – including several areas of policy that have never been subject to trade agreements before , ” said Davies , adding it 's “ abnormal ” and “ unacceptable ” to keep lawmakers and the public in the dark .
U.S. members of Congress can request access to the draft documents , but are required to keep secret about what they see . All the same , a few have hinted at what they 've seen .
Rep. Alan Grayson , a Florida Democrat , said they had seen the text and said the agreement , as it stands , “ hands the sovereignty of our country over to corporate interests . ”
That 's a common theme among critics of the deal , who say it goes farther than earlier trade deals in securing rights and privileges for corporate interests .
But the Harper government argues Canada should n't be left out of a major trade deal like this , lest it miss out on future economic opportunities .
“ Opening new markets and creating new business opportunities leads to jobs , growth and long-term prosperity for all Canadians , ” Prime Minister Stephen Harper said last year .
“ A TPP agreement will enhance trade in the Asia-Pacific region and will provide greater economic opportunity for Canadians and Canadian businesses . ”

On December 25 , representatives of the Damascus government , Russia and the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) in the Eastern Qalamun region held a meeting to negotiate the fate of the region . However , no agreement was reached , according to Syrian oppositions actives .
Saaed Saif , spokesperson for the US-backed FSA group Ahmad al-Abdo Forces , told the Syrian oppositions news outlet Enab Baladi that the negotiation failed because the Russian side and the Syrian government insisted that a full reconciliation deal should replace the de-escalation agreement reached on September 5 .
Moscow and Damascus are looking for a reconciliation deal that would allow expelling Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham ( HTS ) from the Eastern Qalamun region and to force the FSA to hand over its weapons to the Syrian Arab Army ( SAA ) , according to pro-government sources .
Similar negotiations between Damascus government , Russia and the FSA in the Eastern Qalamun region were held on October 26 . However , just like now the FSA refused to hand over it weapons or even to drive HTS out of the region .
The SAA fulfilled its side of the agreement as it allows aid convoys to enter Eastern Qalamun on a regular basis . Moreover , the SAA eased the civilian movement from and to the region .
Many observers believe that HTS is pressuring the FSA to refuse all the demands of the Damascus government and Russia . This negative behavior could lead to an escalation in the region in the future .

Bernie Sanders Bernard ( Bernie ) SandersPush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback Sanders : ' I fully expect ' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed ' 2016 primary Sanders : 'Damn right ' I 'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes ' MORE 's lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) over access to party data is still active in federal court despite the two sides reaching an agreement over the weekend .
While the DNC agreed to restore the Sanders team 's access as it investigates how the campaign improperly obtained data belonging to presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders : ' I fully expect ' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed ' 2016 primary Sanders : 'Damn right ' I 'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes ' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson : Clinton staff are 'biggest a -- holes in American politics ' MORE , a federal district court sent the committee a summons on Monday giving it three weeks to respond to the lawsuit .
While the main prong of the case — access to the party 's valuable voter data — has been settled , the Sanders suit also claims damages prompted by the negligence of the DNC for hiring a vendor that allowed the security breach to occur in the first place .
Tad Devine , a Sanders adviser , told The Hill that while attorneys representing both Sanders and the DNC are continuing to negotiate , the lawsuit has not been withdrawn .
“ My understanding is that while the original complaint was seeking injunctive relief , which was not necessary once the parties agreed , there is a contractual dispute , ” they said Monday .
“ The current status of that is that the attorneys on both sides are speaking to one another , [ and ] on the basis of their discussions , we will make a decision on how we want to move forward . ”
A DNC official would not comment on the pending litigation , only reiterating that the Sanders campaign cooperated with its investigation by providing the party with data it requested on Friday , which led to it restoring access to the data .
Campaign staff dueled through the media over the weekend about the situations .

Team Sanders bashed the DNC for overreacting , accusing the party of restricting its access to the data in an overt attempt to help Clinton . Meanwhile , Clinton 's spokesperson chided the Sanders campaign as going “ hog-wild , downloading as much data as they could get ” during the vulnerability and questioning whether the Sanders campaign committed a crime .
The Sanders campaign fired its national data director and suspended two others in the wake of the data breach . According to The New York Times , audit logs showed that three other campaign aides made at least 25 searches of Clinton 's data .
The candidates took a muted approach on the debate stage Saturday night , where Sanders apologized for the breach and Clinton accepted , calling for the two candidates to move on from the issue .
On Sunday , however , Sanders argued that the DNC was not treating them fairly and , as their campaign had contended on Friday , they blamed the data vendor for the breach .
`` As a result of a breach caused by the DNC vendor , not by us , information came into our campaign about the Clinton campaign , ” they said on `` Meet the Press . ''
“ We did not go out and take it . ”

Just when will Aston Villa 's injury list relent ?
Today we can reveal the news that Nathan Baker will be out for at least two months with a knee injury .
It 's another blow for manager Paul Lambert who will be severely short on central defenders when Southampton visit Villa Park on Monday .
While Baker could miss as many as 12 games , Swiss defender Philippe Senderos also faces a month on the sidelines and captain Ron Vlaar has been ruled out , too .
It 's been a tough time for Villa of late and these fresh setbacks will make the expected recovery even tougher .
Baker was just starting to find some form until they were stretchered off in the final few minutes of the recent 0-0 draw with West Ham , Senderos picked up their knock while on international duty and Vlaar was also injured whilst playing for Holland last week .
Jores Okore and Ciaran Clark are likely to fill in but Chris Herd is also an option for Lambert to consider .
Some good news is that Alan Hutton is fit and available to play .
View photos from Villa 's battling draw at West Ham
Whether they fit straight back in after three games out remains to be seen because their replacement Matt Lowton has performed well in their absence .
Hutton missed Scotland 's defeat to England in the week as they continued their recovery from an ankle injury but Lambert confirmed they will be in their thoughts on Monday .
Christian Benteke , meanwhile , will sit out of their second game of a three-match suspension against the Saints .
Their red card against Tottenham came just as they were starting to find their feet again in the Premier League following a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a ruptured Achilles .
Lambert reckons their international outing for Belgium would have kept them ticking over just nicely , though .
“ It 's been good that he 's had the games . He 's still missing for us obviously but the good thing for us is that he 's getting games .
“ He 's doing well in training , too . Every day they are looking better .
“ The Belgium game will have helped him . ”

The four men stood beaming like proud fathers as their Labrador retrievers playfully romped with one another on a grassy field under a sunny sky earlier this month .
Up close it looked like any group of dog owners enjoying a beautiful day at the park . The tall chain-link fences and foreboding razor wire in the background , combined with the men 's matching clothes , told a different story .
The men are four of the 720 inmates at medium-security Enfield Correctional Institution in Connecticut , located about 25 miles northeast of Hartford , where they work with the nonprofit organization America 's VetDogs to train service animals that will help wounded military veterans and others suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
The dogs are n't the only ones learning from the experience , either .
`` It definitely makes me feel a lot better about myself , because after committing a crime , being in here you sometimes feel like everybody looks at you as like being condemned , '' an inmate named Tyrel told TODAY . `` Being given the opportunity to — and being entrusted with a dog , to train and to work with other people , it makes you feel good , and it makes you see that you can be given another opportunity . ''

Tyrel , whose dog is 5-month-old Clancy , is one of 20 inmates at Enfield who are involved in the program . They are up for parole next year after being convicted of larceny , and their work with Clancy and other dogs provides hope for the future as well as skills they may be able to use as a professional dog trainer .
`` It gives me confidence that everyone has n't given up on me , '' they said .
' A win-win '
The rate of recidivism for the average inmate at Enfield is 85 percent . For those involved in the AVD program , it 's less than 25 percent . Samantha Okazaki / TODAY
The program began at a women 's prison in Framingham , Massachusetts , in 2014 , and has since expanded to 12 prisons on the East Coast with 10 dogs being trained per prison , according to Mark Tyler , the AVD instructor who works with the Enfield inmates .
The amount of wounded veterans returning from combat was exceeding the supply of available service dogs , so AVD was looking for a way to get them trained faster in order to reduce the waiting period for veterans to receive them . They worked with the prison administrations and the unions representing the correctional officers to help make it a reality .

Thanks to being able to work with inmates on a daily basis , the training period for the dogs has been shortened from two years to a year , reducing the average wait for a service dog by a veteran from five years to two years .
`` I hate the clichés that are thrown around , but this truly is a win-win program for everybody involved , '' Tyler said .
The program at Enfield features 10 inmates who serve as primary handlers of 10 dogs , including Crema and Mocha , who are the siblings of Charlie , TODAY 's own puppy with a purpose . The primary handlers spend nearly every hour of the day with their pooch , and there are also 10 backup handlers who step in when the primary handler is involved in other activities at the prison .
Each dog is trained for the rigorous test to become a service dog , but not all of them pass . About 6 out of 10 make the cut .
The dogs sleep in cages right beside the inmates ' bunkbeds in their dorm-like cells . On the weekends , the animals leave the prison and are cared for by outside civilians involved in the program .
The rate of recidivism for the average inmate at Enfield is 85 percent , according to Timbro . For those involved in the AVD program , it 's less than 25 percent .
Inmates are selected based on a clean disciplinary record , the length of their sentence and factors such as the nature of their crime . More than 600 have applied in the two years the program has been at Enfield .
The men in the program all wear their white America 's VetDogs shirts with pride .
`` It really helps the inmates with patience and problem-solving skills , '' Enfield correctional counselor Joe Timbro , whose father is a Vietnam veteran , told TODAY . `` A lot of these guys do n't know how to process their emotions , or they 've never had to care for something like a dog before , so this teaches them those skills . ''
Gerard has trained multiple dogs for America 's VetDogs ' prison program . `` It 's just knowing that you need to guide this dog , you need to develop this dog into something kind of more than you , '' they said . Samantha Okazaki / TODAY
`` ( The dog ) does n't care what that person did in the past , '' Tyler said . `` He does n't make those judgments . They care who they are today . Are they honest today ? Are they trustworthy ? Do they keep that puppy safe ? I think because ( the dog ) does n't pass those judgments , that type of relationship is likely one that is very valued at a prison . ''

The rate of recidivism for the average inmate at Enfield is 85 percent , according to Timbro . For those involved in the AVD program , it 's less than 25 percent .
Changing lives
The inmates have two training sessions per day with the dogs , who learn skills like opening refrigerator doors , turning on light switches and picking up items off the ground that might be difficult for a wounded veteran to reach .
`` Once I started working with the dogs and seeing how smart they are and how they respond to you with the proper training and skills that you showed them , it amazed me , '' Tyrel said . `` I never knew dogs were that smart . It 's really exceeded my expectations . ''
Because inmates are able to devote more time to training , dogs are able to complete the program in one year instead of the typical two years .
The constant companionship of the dog also makes a difference in the inmates ' mental well-being .
`` You try to stay constructive , and stay active in your mind , but eventually there 's only so much you can do and you end up kind of just sitting around waiting , just doing time , '' inmate Gerard , who works with Crema , told TODAY . `` With a dog , it changes that whole little concept . You 're always doing something . ''
Each dog is trained for the rigorous test to become a service dog , but not all of them pass . About 6 out of 10 make the cut , and the rest often become bomb-sniffing dogs for law enforcement agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , according to Tyler .

`` It makes you almost feel like a proud dad , like when you send your child off to school and they do well , '' Tyrel said .
The veteran component is also meaningful to the inmates , many of whom have military members in their families . U.S. Army veteran David Cameron , who received a dog named Disco from the program , relayed their gratitude in a letter to the prison .

`` This amazing dog instantly gave me a sense of security that I never felt before , '' Cameron wrote . `` Within a week I stopped taking sleeping pills that I had been using every night for almost three years . They helped me to open up to people and talk to strangers who I previously would have just avoided eye contact with .

`` Disco has become such an important member of our family , and I do n't know what I would do without him . ''
As the inmates in the program focus on the day they get to change their own lives upon their release , they take solace knowing their time with their dogs is doing the same for a special group of people .
`` It 's just knowing that you need to guide this dog , you need to develop this dog into something kind of more than you , '' Gerard said . `` This dog is going to become more than the program ; it 's going to do more than just what 's written down on the pieces of paper . This dog is going to essentially change someone 's life . ''

The Obama regime 's official explanation for the murder of our ambassador to Libya and three staffers amid the destruction of our Benghazi consulate ” that it was spontaneous and quasi-legitimized by an anti-Muhammad film ” seems to be unraveling . But perhaps more importantly , it points out the insanity that has been US foreign policy from Morocco to Afghanistan since World War II .
Dubya dubbed this policy the “ global democratic revolution ”  ” the idea that given the right combination of idealistic leadership and US-supported regime change , the Middle East 's civic life would magically transform into that of Ray Bradbury 's Green Town , Illinois . To these dreamers , 2011 's “ Arab Spring ”  seemed proof that in the Islamosphere , American-style rule of law was right around the corner . But even as their ears were oblivious to the dying cries of Iraq 's Chaldean and Assyrian communities , so have they been to those of Coptic and Syrian Christians . One would think the death rattles of American diplomats might at least catch their ears , but no such luck .
“ Due to religious and cultural histories too complex for the average American politico or bureaucrat to understand , the Muslim world is mind-numbingly fragmented. ” 
Due to religious and cultural histories too complex for the average American politico or bureaucrat to understand , the Muslim world is mind-numbingly fragmented . Internal peace in any given region or country has inevitably been imposed from outside . As the topmost clique in each was small and usually alien , the rulership was constrained to govern through and with coalitions of minority groups ” a pluralism dictated by necessity rather than ideology . This pattern was disrupted by the West 's growing power , culminating in the Ottoman Empire ‘ s defeat in World War I and subsequent deposition of the Sultan and Caliph .
Then followed the first of three waves of Westernization . This wave saw various traditional rulers that the West ” especially the British and French ” either raised or reinforced . Among them were the rulers of Morocco , Libya , Egypt , Tunisia , Iraq , Jordan , Iran , Afghanistan , Yemen , southern Arabia , and the Persian Gulf states . There was much to criticize about these regimes : no separation of religion and state ; hereditary monarchy ; minority rule ; inefficiency ; suspicion of modern education ; rampant cronyism ; limits upon freedom of speech , religion , and the press ; and governmental legitimacy founded on legends rather than elections . But what these criticisms failed to understand is that in this region , majority rule inevitably means minority oppression .
And so we helped bring to power in various countries people such as Nasser , the Ba ” ath Parties , and Gaddafi ” they were Westernization 's second wave . They initially had much to recommend them to American policymakers . These revolutionaries broke down old aristocracies and tended to be secular rather than religious . They introduced the form ” if not the substance ” of republican government . They had a few small drawbacks . So long as the Soviet Union lasted , they were often pro-Soviet ; they too were forced to rule through minorities ; and as their regimes aged , they tended to become ever nastier in terms of bloody repression . So throughout the past two years , we have encouraged their overthrow in the “ Arab Spring ”  and its aftermath .

“ We have the evidence , Brendan , ” one detective says . “ We just need you to be honest with us . ”

But while Making a Murderer allows the viewer to believe that the authorities knowingly framed an innocent man , it also guides us towards a more likely and perhaps even more troubling verdict : that investigators may have tampered with planted evidence because they believed themselves to be serving a higher law . “ I did n't see them plant evidence with my own two eyes , ” Steven 's lawyer , Dean Strang , says in Making a Murderer :
I did n't see it . But do I understand how human beings might be tempted to plant evidence under the circumstances in which the Manitowoc County Sheriff 's Department found itself after Steven 's exoneration ? ... Do I have any difficulty understanding what human emotions might have driven police officers to want to augment or confirm their beliefs that they must have killed Teresa Halbach ? I do n't have any difficulty understanding those human emotions at all .
This is just one of the countless examples that Making a Murderer uses to complicate the easy story the Steven Avery case has been reduced to . In Making a Murderer , we see the Avery family 's vulnerabilities exploited as the authorities seek to confuse them and turn them against each other . We can see an investigation developing not around an emerging set of questions , but around a foregone conclusion . “ Before the police say they 've opened [ Teresa 's ] car , ” Strang argued at Steven 's trial , “ before they say they know of any blood of any sort , in or on the car , before anybody even knows whether this young woman has been hurt or killed , the focus is on Steven Avery. ” The politicians who assembled the Avery Task force quickly distanced themselves from him , and gave their bill a different , less tainted name . The Wisconsin Innocence Project ceased to trumpet its role in Avery 's early exoneration ; their name was removed from their website . To make matters worse , once the prosecution was armed with Brendan Dassey 's confession , the district attorney Kenneth Kratz held a press conference , at which they described a possible version of events in lurid detail . After a statement like this , finding twelve jurors who would be able to go into the trial with a presumption of Steven Avery 's innocence ca n't have been easy .
It 's not difficult to understand how a story that breaks a small town 's heart can deprive onlookers of the will to look at these complexities . It 's far more difficult to argue that , on a national scale , outrage can be our only response to crimes like these . If we are capable of being objective , it is our job to do so . It is our responsibility to see how often we are confronted with a complicated narrative and reduce it to a morality play , and to question the satisfaction that comes with believing that every new incarceration , no matter how needlessly punitive or unethically secured , means justice has been served . Examining a narrative like this one in all its complexity—or at least ten hours ' worth of its complexity—may give us a chance to see that even an apparently simple story is likely anything but . Someday , we may find ourselves in a position where our ability to see this complexity will allow us to act not as onlookers , but as more effective jurors .
If Making a Murderer bears a hopeful message , it 's not that the criminal justice system is doing its job ; or even that we stand a chance of fixing it . Instead , it tells us that audiences have begun asking for more than the simple stories we have long been satisfied with , and that we have begun to believe that the truth may be more complicated than we have allowed ourselves to believe . Making a Murderer falls into a growing subgenre of true crime narratives that may captivate audiences precisely because they are n't primarily concerned with captivating us at all . They do n't want to keep us snared through commercial breaks or intoxicate us with rage and pity . They have a quieter mission , but one that can have a far greater impact on their subjects ' lives . Here are the facts , they tell us . Now what will you do with them ?
Watching Making a Murderer , it 's hard not to turn to Errol Morris 's groundbreaking 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line , which is also currently streaming on Netflix . The film presents the dispassionate but ultimately devastating argument that fabricated or unreliable eyewitness accounts led to the wrongful conviction of an innocent man , Randall Adams , in the 1976 murder of a Dallas police officer . Randall Adams was exonerated in 1989 , after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that the case 's prosecutor , Douglas Mulder , withheld evidence suggesting that Emily Miller , the state 's key witness against Adams , had committed perjury . At the time of the Adams 's trial , The Thin Blue Line pointed out to viewers , Mulder was working to maintain a winning streak .
Here are the facts , these documentaries tell us . Now what will you do with them ?
“ People say the movie got [ Adams ] out of prison , ” Morris recalled in a 2004 interview with the Believer , “ It 's not really true . What got them out of prison was my investigation , part of which was done with a camera. ” Morris allowed the viewer to take on the role of investigator , watching as witnesses unintentionally called their own reliability into question and contradicted the statements they had made at trial . The audience could compare the two competing narratives that had been presented at Adams 's trial , and make their own decisions about where the truth lay .
I thought about this authorial decision a lot when I taught college composition classes , since one of my stock assignments was Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky 's 1996 documentary Paradise Lost : The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills . Like Morris , Berlinger and Sinofsky present us with compelling evidence that the documentary 's subjects , the West Memphis Three , were innocent of the brutal triple homicide of which they were convicted in 1993 . Like Morris , they too were instrumental in freeing their subjects from prison . And , like Morris , they give us the material to draw the same conclusions they have , but they do not tell us what to think . My students would watch the documentary , and return to class bearing either passionately-written indictments of the corrupt criminal justice system , or equally passionate condemnations of the evil murderers they believed the documentary had depicted . If they ended up changing their minds , their convictions would be stronger for the simple fact that they had arrived at them on their own .
This is a challenging genre of documentary—difficult to countenance as a viewer , and , I would imagine , harrowing to create—but it is one that has flourished in the last few years . Perhaps the most striking example of this recent trend is Sarah Koenig 's Serial podcast , which presented in its first season a case so hopelessly paradoxical that neither host nor listeners could decide where the truth might lie . Adnan Syed , a Maryland teenager , was convicted of the 1999 murder of their ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee , largely because of a friend 's testimony . The story was likely enough , but many of the details of the case did not add up , even if they came tantalizingly close to doing so . Something was always missing , and throughout the series , Koenig was never able to say what that something was : only to make their listeners as fixated on its absence as they are .
District attorney Kenneth Kratz held a press conference , at which they described a possible version of events in lurid detail . Making a Murderer / Netflix
Confronted with a mystery , many fans refused to move on : Serial has spawned unofficial sequel podcasts , continued media coverage , and endless conversations and debates both online and off . The story is n't over . It never was , of course : we 've merely developed the ability to recognize this fact . If Adnan Syed is able to appeal their conviction , some credit is due to the attention Serial brought to the case . Could Making a Murderer have a similar impact on Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey 's fates ? Some of the same intense interest is already gathering around their cases on Reddit , where viewers have shared their outrage and their theories ; some viewers have even used Yelp to leave Avery 's prosecutor negative reviews , and Anonymous has vowed to bring new evidence to light .
At a time when we have come to doubt the American criminal justice system 's ability not just to proceed without error but to do much of anything right , narratives like Making a Murderer and Serial provide an oddly comforting alternative to the 24-hour news cycle 's endless reiteration of thoughtless atrocities and easy conclusions . Yes , documentarians like Koenig , Morris , Berlinger and Sinofsky , and now Ricciardi and Demos tell us : Yes , the system makes mistakes . These mistakes are sometimes borne of ignorance and sometimes borne of malice , but their motivation does not change their capacity to alter a life forever , or to simply destroy it . Those who are entrusted with our protection could be the same people who harm us or our loved ones . We can not trust that a story is true simply because we want it to be—and while it 's often impossible to know the whole truth in a criminal case , we can at least be truthful about the limits of our knowledge and the extent of our doubt . Increasingly , Americans are demanding the tools we need to do just that .

You know how some people celebrate their birthday for an entire week because hell yeah , self love ? Well if you 're Asian and/or Pacific Islander American and identify as a multiracial , chances are you already know why May can feel exactly like that much-needed celebration of intersectionality . Not only do we celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month , but thanks to blogger Light Skinned-ed Girl , May has been keeping Mixed Experience History Month strong since 2007 .
Of course , just because you 're celebrating does n't always mean it 's easy to find the right people to party with . Even though you might have read up on some Black and Asian couples , it 's not the same as seeing a character whose backstory feels like yours . Never fear , Asian ( and ) Black nerds ! Here 's a few of my favorite Blasian characters to celebrate in May and throughout the rest of the year .
Connor Hawke/DC Comics
[ divider type= ” space_thin ” ] I 'd be remiss if I did n't start my list with perhaps the most famous Blasian superhero , not to mention one of a microscopic few characters whose identity includes more than two races . Popularly known as the son of Oliver Queen aka the Green Arrow ( whose title they would go on to share ) , Connor was raised by their Black and Korean mother Sandra Moonday Hawke until they joined an ashram at a young age . There they developed their extraordinary archery talents and a dedication to peace and harmony that helped define their gentle but protective personality . DC Comics continuity being what it is , there was an alarming instance of whitewashing in the very beginning of the post-Flashpoint universe but thankfully the television show Legends of Tomorrow has taken the steps to correct this awful mistake . As with many comic heroes , Connor 's stories are pretty extensive , however , so for readers just being introduced to them I suggest checking out their fairly recent two part Convergence issues to get a sense for their character .
Hazel/Image Comics
[ divider type= ” space_thin ” ] Everyone 's favorite space baby , Hazel is the narrator for BNP favorite comic Saga , an epic tale of literal star-crossed lovers Marko and Alana . Blunt and occasionally a bit lewd , the impossibility of Hazel 's existence becomes the crux of a story that shows how love struggles to survive against the odds of cultural misunderstandings and war-torn planets . And yes , while Hazel 's parents are n't exactly human the creators have specified repeatedly that their features are based on people of color .
Silhouette and Aaron Chord/Marvel Comics
some mystic orientalist BS
[ divider type= ” space_thin ” ] Know what 's better than one Blasian comic character ? That 's right , two Blasian comic characters with representation of differently abled bodies ! A brother and sister duo known respectively as Silhouette and Midnight 's Fire , the Chord siblings were born as a result ofa hidden Cambodian cult called the Dragon 's Breath making a sketchy deal with a unit of American soldiers . While at first the siblings banned together to use their superpowers to take down gangs in New York City , Silhouette 's eventual paralysis pushed Midnight 's Fire into a violent quest for revenge . Do n't be confused by the crutches , however ; Silhouette 's badass fighting style puts your favorite martial artist to shame in a heartbeat .
Monika Tsurutani/Hirunaka no Ryuusei
If you 're a shoujo manga fan chances are you 've already cried your way through Mika Yamamori 's Hirunaka no Ryuusei ( Daytime Shooting Star ) a few times , but even with all the intense romantic drama who could forget our incredibly entertaining supporting cast ? While Monika Tsurutani aka Tsuru is n't the comic 's main attraction , their kind and caring personality and adorable relationship with the bashful Inukai make them an easy character to love . Though they are described officially as being mixed race Japanese , one look and you know home girl 's curls and afro puffs be too on fleek not to be in Formation .
Taranee Cook/W.I.T.C.H .
[ divider type= ” space_thin ” ] Look , there 's definitely a W.I.T.C.H . post on its way because this may be one of the most underrated girl power series to ever be created and its greatness needs to be known . Much like your typical teenager team up , this story centers around five girls who must protect the Earth as the Guardians of Kandrakar with their new found elemental powers . Taranee , our resident sweetheart nerd , received the gift of fire whose power increases based on their emotions . While Taranee 's mother seems to be an unfortunately unidentified ( ? ? ? ) Asian American , their representation as a judge married to a lawyer-turned-psychologist showcases a rare instance of a fictional couple of color with high paying jobs . Due to differences in the show and comic there are some admittedly spoilery reasons why Taranee 's origins are up for debate , but let 's just say this interpretation stands as my favorite .
Oriana/Love ! Love ! Fighting !
[ divider type= ” space_thin ” ] Longtime readers will know this list would n't be complete without Sharean Morishita 's incredible Black Korean hero Oriana . While I 've already spent plenty of time singing this manga 's praises , know that if you have not already invested in this heart warming plus-sized , pro-natural , 100 % necessary representation of Blasian women already , then you might want to reconsider that next comic purchase .

Calgary MP Rob Anders has once again drawn criticism for controversial comments , this time about the transgender community .
Anders wants to stop Bill C279 , a private member 's bill that would amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and hate crime section of the Criminal Code to include `` gender identity '' and `` gender expression '' as grounds for discrimination .
They say the bill 's goal is to give transgender men access to women 's washrooms , which has led it to be nicknamed the `` bathroom bill '' proposal .
They said it 's the duty of the House of Commons to protect children from any exposure or harm that will come from giving men this kind of access .
Anders sent a letter and a petition to a local church , urging the pastor to distribute it . The petition can also be found on Anders ' website .
MP Randall Garrison , the NDP representative for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca in B.C. , introduced the bill .
They said the comments made by Anders were either made out of ignorance or they are trying to spread fear about transgender people by equating them to sexual predators .
`` He clearly does n't understand the basic concepts to do with transgender Canadians , '' said Garrison .
They said the bill fills a gap because there are legal questions about whether transgender people are included in protections that are available to all other Canadians .
Garrison said the bill is expected to come back to the justice committee in November , and since 150 MPs have previously voted in favour of the bill they do n't believe this type of argument will have any sway .
`` I guess it 's what I 've come to expect from Mr. Anders ... time for their weekly apology , '' they said .
Transgender advocates outraged
Kelly Ernst , senior program director of the Sheldon Chumir Foundation for Ethics in Leadership , agrees that Anders ' petition raises a stereotype that has no basis in fact .
`` When you read the petition and bill side by side you understand that the petition really has nothing to do with the intent of the bill , '' they said .
They said the proposed legislation change only brings the language of the Criminal Code and Human Rights Act up to the standard used in courtrooms and human right commissions that recognize people with different gender identities have equal rights .
Transgender advocate Jan Buterman says they ca n't believe what Anders is implying with their petition .
`` The suggestion that this is somehow some … conspiracy of trans people to sneak into bathrooms deliberately to harm people — it 's ludicrous , '' Buterman says .
`` Trans people have been using bathrooms all over Canada for decades with , as far as I know , zero evidence of any incidents whatsoever . ''
Anders declined a request from CBC News for an interview on the issue .
Earlier this week , Anders apologized for saying Tom Mulcair hastened the death of former NDP leader Jack Layton .
You 've probably seen them before : internal border checkpoint refusals , now a popular YouTube genre . Some are funny . Others are hostile . But for Greg Rosenberg , a naturalized U.S. citizen who speaks accented English , an encounter with South Texas border patrol resulted in weeks of jail time without a single charge being prosecuted .
Rosenberg immigrated to America 10 years ago from Armenia . Memories and family stories of Soviet rule in their country of origin infused them with strong political beliefs and a reverence for individual rights .
`` Back then [ in Soviet-controlled Armenia ] , if you complained about the government , they took you to Siberia , '' says Rosenberg .
So perhaps it 's no surprise that Rosenberg is a checkpoint protester . As a long-haul trucker , they have to drive through these all the time . After all , there are about 170 of them scattered across the United States . And keep in mind , these checkpoints are n't on an actual border . They just have to be within 100 miles of one . The ACLU estimates that roughly two-thirds of the nation 's population lives within this 100-mile zone .
Rosenberg 's ordeal began in the border town of Laredo , TX . They and their friend pulled onto I-35 North at around midnight on September 26 in a truck carrying a load of Xerox machines destined for Ft. Worth . But only 29 miles north of the border , they 'd encounter the Laredo North Border Patrol Station . And Greg would undergo a checkpoint interrogation like he 'd never experienced before .
`` They arrested me for what I looked like , but they pressed the charges because of my beliefs , '' says Rosenberg .
To see the full story of the encounter that led to Rosenberg 's 19-day detainment on charges of `` resisting , assaulting , or impeding arrest , '' watch the video above . Scroll down for downloadable versions . Approximately 9 minutes . Shot , produced , and edited by Zach Weissmueller .
Bengaluru : The Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) is planning to launch a record 68 satellites in one mission by early next year , it announced yesterday .
“ There are many launches . There is one particular launch we are planning about 68 satellites , that 's also there , that is yet to be finalised , ” Rakesh Sasibhushan , chairperson and managing director of Antrix told reporters in response to a question on the line up .
Antrix is the commercial arm of ISRO .
According to officials , if everything goes well , the launch may take place in another six to seven months and “ the satellites will be nano in nature from foreign countries . ”
Setting a record in its space programme , ISRO successfully launched 20 satellites in June this year – including its earth observation Cartosat-2 series . It launched all the satellites in a single mission on board ISRO 's workhorse PSLV-C34 from the spaceport in Sriharkota , Andhra Pradesh .
The space agency earlier sent 10 satellites into orbit in a single mission in 2008 .
Certain sections of the US have expressed concern regarding ISRO 's launches since the organisation is subsidised by the Indian government . Sasibhushan responded to these concerns saying , “ our competitiveness will give answer for this . ”
“ All launches are subsidised , it is not that we are subsidising or somebody else is subsidising . These government subsidies in the form of R and D ( research and development ) investment comes in all launch programmes , now some private industries have come up who have started questioning , let them question , ” they said .
“ We have our own programme , we are competing with the world , we will try to be more competitive and probably that will provide the answer , ” they added .
Rakesh said small satellites are going to become a large market and it can be exploited by Indian industries .
“ ISRO can play a technology provider 's role there . We would like to get this across to as many industries as possible to see that tomorrow the country is benefited by this . ”
What 's the biggest unmet need that most Intuitives face ?
While discussing the unique needs of Intuitives – or people who use intuition has their primary way of learning information – the same need pops up over and over gain . It 's what we at Personality Hacker call the Greatest Unmet Need of Intuitives . It 's actually pretty simple and very easy , and maybe because of that it 's importance is diminished and gets neglected .
What is that need ? Highly abstract , conceptual conversation . It 's conversation that goes beyond the every day norm of chit-chat and ‘ catching up ' . Subjects like philosophy , ethics , science , idea-generation and possibilities thinking about the future and the meaning of reality . While it may feel great to an Intuitive that engage in this kind of conversation , they may not realize it 's a basic need .
This kind of conversation does two things for Intuitives :
1 . It gives them energy , amps us up , and helps them see possibilities they had n't considered before . It 's like food for the mind , or mental calories , and for those who lead with intuition it may be necessary for basic psychological health .
2 . It gives them freedom . It 's not always easy to find another person who will go down these rabbit holes with you conversationally , and sometimes the perpetual searching for it makes one feel like a freak . When an Intuitive finds someone who will do a ‘ deep dive ' , there 's an entire world of permission that opens up . Permission to think outside the box , to consider new ways of solving challenges and of thinking . This permission is extremely freeing , and it 's important to have that sense of permission .
One of the great run-off benefits of these conversations is the cross pollination ideas . If ideas are a technology , then intuitive conversation becomes a laboratory . The more they cross pollinate each other 's ideas , the more sophisticated they become so when they 're brought to the world they 're more fleshed out , useful , and a true gift .
If you 're an Intuitive , keep in mind that this kind of conversation is n't just a nice to have , it 's a need to have .
To know definitively if you 're an Intuitive learning style , take the Genius Style Assessment . If you turn out as a Perspectives or Exploration genius , you 're an Intuitive .
These comments were offered to the Maryland Redistricting Reform Commission
By Roy T. Meyers
Professor of Political Science , UMBC
I hope that the commission 's work is the start of a serious examination of how to reform a process that is clearly flawed , as is most obviously shown by the shape of the congressional district in which I reside , the 3rd Congressional District .
I say this even though I lean Democratic and am glad that the partisan gerrymandering of Maryland partially offsets the extensive partisan gerrymandering conducted by Republicans in many other states .
On the other hand , designing districts to maximize partisan advantage , or alternatively to maximize incumbent protection , is not the way citizens should want legislative districts to be drawn . Voters should be able to choose their representatives , and not the other way around .
Balancing attributes
In general , therefore , I would prefer that a balanced commission draw legislative districts–if , and this is a very important if , the commission would be expected to sensibly balance the multiple attributes of a desirable districting plan .
Maryland has a wonderful tradition of using commissions and task forces , whether created by the legislature or governor , to investigate complicated issues by engaging the public and by drawing on policy experts .
I believe experience also shows that the most successful groups of this type are those that take the time that is necessary to fully discuss controversial issues , hearing from all sides , so that there is more of an opportunity to reach a meeting of the minds .
Regarding the substance , I have n't done original research on this issue since graduate school ; my research specialty is instead government budgets . I have long followed and commented on Maryland 's budget , without regard to my partisan preferences , based on the belief that it is in the benefit of all Marylanders that the state 's budget be prudent and that it efficiently allocate resources towards our highest priorities .
Difficult trade-offs necessary
As you know , budgets almost always require decision-makers to make difficult tradeoffs . This is also the case for designing legislative districts , whether it is done by partisan politicians or appointed commissioners .
I already provided a recent article by Josh Ryan and Jeffrey Lyons , which finds that the districts drawn by commissions are similar to districts drawn by state legislatures , in both the partisan balance of voters and the voting behavior of representatives .
This suggests that if you want a Maryland commission to produce a better outcome , it will need to be carefully structured . It is therefore very important that you not accept simplistic recommendations for how a commission should be charged with its important task .
Instead , you should provide suggestions on how a commission could balance the sometimes conflicting guidance provided by different standards for redistricting . There is one standard for redistricting that must be met–population equality across districts , as defined by the Supreme Court . But many other posited standards for redistricting are harder to interpret and put into practice .
Contiguity
Let 's start with contiguity , a standard that appears to be violated by the shape of the 3rd district , unless you are traveling by boat between Gibson Island and Annapolis . Note , however , that these two locations could be viewed as members of a “ community of interest. ” To many on the shore , the state of the Bay is a very important concern , and traveling by boat to visit those who share that interest is a common behavior .
Arguably , then , contiguity should not be restricted to areas connected by land . Using a community interest standard , it would be easy to justify a district that combined the southern Eastern Shore with Southern Maryland–which was the case , for example , during the 1970s and 1980s .
Compactness
Regarding another geographical standard , compactness , the asupervisorstioned 3rd district is obviously not compact . But what changes would be necessary for it to be sufficiently compact ?
Going beyond that , would it be possible to take politics out of redistricting by requiring that districts , above all other considerations besides equal population , maximize compactness ?
In the debates about Maryland 's maps , some have implicitly supported this view by stating that the “ best ” shape for districts is a square , or alternatively , a circle . Math and mapping experts have proposed various algorithms that they claim would produce compact and unbiased districts . However , their different algorithms can produce quite different results .
Note also that Maryland has a non-compact shape in the first place . But the most important problem with over-relying on the compactness criterion is that it does n't match the principle that legislators should represent people , not geographical shapes on the map .
Population not distributed evenly
This is important because it is almost always the case that the population is not distributed evenly across the map .
For example , a clear finding from political science research is that , across the country , Democrats are more concentrated geographically than are Republicans . While this is a bit less the case in Maryland , it is likely that using a strict compactness standard in Maryland would cause Democrats to “ waste ” proportionately more votes , similar to a “ packing ” strategy that would be employed by Republicans if they were able to design a partisan gerrymander .
In other words , using a strict standard of compactness in hopes of taking politics out of the process would have the opposite effect .
Note that in making these observations , I am not opposing the value of compactness . Getting back to the 3rd district , its design makes it difficult for the incumbent to have a personal presence in the many communities that it covers . District designs should not encourage legislators to communicate mostly through robocalls and mailers .
So it would be useful to list compactness as one of several important criteria that a commission should weigh in judging alternative designs ; it just should n't be the dominant one .
Observing city and county lines
Another standard that is often suggested is that districts should minimize the crossing of county/city lines and the breaking up of counties into multiple districts . This is a particularly difficult standard to use when you must have eight Congressional districts with equal populations , given the varying sizes of Maryland 's 24 county-level local governments .
While it is desirable not to split counties unnecessarily into numerous Congressional districts , a redistricting commission should have the flexibility to cross county lines .
“ Communities of interest , ” which can be defined in many different ways , often cross local government lines . It could also be valuable to have heterogeneous districts that combine areas represented by different local governments .
For example , a district that includes part of Baltimore City as well as parts of the surrounding suburban counties might produce a representative who sees the value of policy that encourages more cooperation and burden sharing between these local governments .
Making districts more competitive
At the national level , some advocates have suggested that a major goal of redistricting reform should be to encourage many more diverse districts , in order to offset how Americans have increasingly sorted themselves geographically into communities that are quite homogenous in economic class and ideology .
If redistricting combined these different neighborhoods so that Congressional districts became more diverse , those districts might also be more competitive electorally , leading to less extremism in the Congress . However , the bulk of evidence so far shows that representatives from districts with more moderate electorates behave little differently from their colleagues who represent very liberal or very conservative electorates , though this may not be the case in the future .
There 's another potential problem with designing more districts to be highly competitive–they may not stay that way .
If a national election favors one party very strongly , one party can win many seats in a landslide . That party can then protect those gains by using the advantages of incumbency to put an effective lock on those seats until the next redistricting .
This leads to the questions of whether there should be a standard that rules out partisan bias , and if so , how that bias can be measured . Regarding the latter , it is sometimes suggested that the percentages of seats held by each party should be the same as their percentages of votes for congressional candidates .
But this correspondence is highly unlikely in a single-member district election system as the parties ' vote shares move away from a 50-50 split . Single member districts almost always produce a bonus to the party with the larger vote share .
Political scientists call this relationship the “ seats-to-votes curve ” –but the shape of that curve is affected by numerous factors besides districts designed to produce partisan bias .
A better method for measuring partisan bias has been developed by political scientist Gary King and their colleagues , which is the symmetry standard . It “ requires that the electoral system treat similarly-situated political parties equally , so that each receives the same fraction of legislative seats for a particular vote percentage as the other party would receive if it had received the same percentage . ”
Statistical analysis of previous election results are used to estimate whether proposed redistricting plans violate this standard .
The final standard that you must consider is how Maryland can comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act . This is such an important and complicated issue that I believe your group must reach out to more experts to evaluate how a commission might address this issue in comparison to how Maryland 's elected officials have treated it .
Not simple
In general , then , it is not a simple matter to determine whether a districting design is fair . The greatest potential of the commission approach is that it might reduce partisan and incumbent protection motivations in designing districts , but there will likely still be criticisms of any plans that a commission proposes .
I do n't have complete suggestions for how a commission should be constituted and how it should operate , but I do believe the following characteristics are most desirable .
It should have a relatively large membership–a dozen or more , with a mix of partisans and non-partisans , and be racially and geographically diverse . A large supermajority should be required for a plan . The commission should , as is current practice , draw on staff expertise in the Department of Planning and the General Assembly . It should encourage the public to suggest alternative plans , and provide a long public comment period on several alternative draft plans .
Reaching out to other governors
I will conclude with a comment on the politics of this issue . As many observers have noted , Maryland Democrats will not unilaterally disarm when the balance of redistricting power across the states is in the hands of Republicans .
This means that you , and the governor , should think about how to entice the Democrats to support your proposal . I sympathize with Maryland Republicans about this , for they are understandably aggrieved about how previous plans have treated them .
But I hope you and the Governor will move on , with the goal of proposing a bill that can pass , not one that will be a partisan blame-generation issue for the 2018 campaign . There are three things you can do towards this end .
First , as I 've already suggested , you should explicitly reject a strict compactness test that would be biased against Democrats . Second , you should consider endorsing a national mandate for commissions in all states , such as the approach proposed by California Representative Alan Lowenthal .
Unfortunately , given the behavior of this Congress , it seems unlikely that their bill will get a fair hearing . So the third suggestion is that you call for a bilateral treaty with another state , a point that Delegate Reznik also made in the open letter they sent to you .
For example , Maryland 's implementation of commission redistricting could be made contingent on similar passage in a state with a Democratic Governor and a Republican legislature where the district map is biased towards Republicans . Drive north from here and you 'll soon enter a state with these characteristics–Pennsylvania . You should ask Governor Hogan to call Governor Wolf , and start a negotiation over cutting a bipartisan deal .

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now ! , democracynow.org , “ Breaking With Convention : War , Peace an the Presidency. ” We 're in Tampa , Florida , covering the convention of the Republicans from the inside and out .
Rocky Anderson , you 're running for president on a third-party ticket , on the Justice line . You talk about two-party tyranny .
ROCKY ANDERSON : Yes . Without a doubt , these two parties , Republicans and Democrats , have a stranglehold on our democracy . They are depriving people around this country not only of being able to get on the ballot , they 're denying all of us of our freedom of choice . And we 're seeing it in the most oppressive ways . In Pennsylvania , four days ago , the Republicans challenged Gary Johnson with the Libertarian Party , they challenged the Constitution Party . And because—
AMY GOODMAN : Gary Johnson—people may not even know who they are .
ROCKY ANDERSON : Well , he 's a former governor of New Mexico . He 's got a lot of people behind them across the country .
AMY GOODMAN : Running for president .
ROCKY ANDERSON : Running for president of the United States . And the Republicans know that in Pennsylvania they can threaten people financially with ruination . When Ralph Nader was challenged by the Democrats , and they prevailed , they threw out thousands and thousands of signatures . They got an $ 81,000 personal judgment against Ralph Nader and executed against their bank account . Their running mate , Peter Camejo , before they died , wrote out a check for $ 20,000—
AMY GOODMAN : To ?
ROCKY ANDERSON : —because they had the—to the Democratic Party for court costs . This is the cost of seeking to get on the ballot , to give people a real choice ? Now the Republican Party has just done the same thing to the Constitution Party . Virgil Goode , their candidate , pulled out the other day because they did n't want to face the prospect of upwards of $ 100,000 in attorneys ' fees if they lost .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Rocky Anderson , can you explain how it is that the two-party system became so entrenched ?
ROCKY ANDERSON : Well , they 're the incumbents , and so they put in place these laws . We do n't have a uniform federal system at all . Every state is different . There are all these land mines . Getting on the ballot is a nightmare . This illusion that we have democracy , that people can get on the ballot—
AMY GOODMAN : How many ballot—how many states are you on the ballot ?
ROCKY ANDERSON : We 'll likely be on between 16 and 18 states . And—
AMY GOODMAN : And what is your main message ?
ROCKY ANDERSON : Our main message is to return democracy to this country , get the corrupting money out of government . It 's going to take a people 's movement to do that , because those who are in office , Republicans and Democrats , both in the White House and Congress , have every interest in maintaining the status quo . And every major public policy disaster is pinned to the corrupting influence of money , including caving to the military-industrial complex , caving in to the for-profit insurance and pharmaceutical industries . That 's why we have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the industrialized world . It 's why we 're the only nation in the industrialized world that does n't provide essential healthcare for all of our citizens , and we 're paying more than double what the average is among the developed world , and with far worse medical outcomes . The rate of infant mortality in the industrial world is the worst—next to worst ; next to Latvia , we have the worst rate .
AMY GOODMAN : Megan Carpentier , we just have 15 seconds , but do you think Ann Romney succeeded in changing the issue of Todd Akin and their comments , “ legitimate rape , ” that so raged right before this convention ?
MEGAN CARPENTIER : I do n't think that talking about love is going to change people 's minds , when they want to talk about the issues . Republicans keep saying , “ This is about the issues . We want to talk about the issues. ” And then , of the two convention speeches they showed , one was about love . That 's not the issue here .
AMY GOODMAN : We 're going to leave it there . Megan Carpentier , executive editor of The Raw Story . Rocky Anderson , now presidential candidate on the Justice Party ticket .
[ There was a video here ]
Tonight in New Hampshire , seven Republican candidates for president in 2012—including Michele Bachmann who just announced them candidacy—shared the stage for the primary season 's first debate . The showdown was moderated by CNN 's John King , who asked tough questions like `` American Idol or Dancing with the Stars ? ''
Yes , really . In a feature King dubbed `` This or That '' and explained as a way to better know the candidates ' personalities , they asked each of them a multiple choice question at some point during the debate . So if you were ever curious about whether Rick Santorum prefers Jay Leno to Conan O'Brien or if Mitt Romney likes their hot wings spicy or mild , you 'll find the answers—along with those of every other GOP candidate—in the above video .

Hosni Mubarak , Egypt 's Former Dictator , Dies
TEHRAN ( FNA ) - Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has died , unconfirmed reports said on Wednesday .
Several independent sources said that Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak has died at the age of 87 .
No official confirmation has been made by the Egyptian government yet .
Contradictory reports have emerged on Mubarak 's death since this morning .
An unnamed source at Maadi Military Hospital , where Mubarak is hospitalized for complicated health problems , told Masrawy website that the former president experienced critical health conditions , but was saved by doctors .
Yet , one of the physicians at the same hospital , who is not a member of Mubarak 's medical team , confirmed their death .
The source said they were told Mubarak experienced massive heart attack and doctors `` failed to rescue them despite lengthy CPR efforts '' .
WASHINGTON — The Central Intelligence Agency has run guns to insurgencies across the world during its 67-year history — from Angola to Nicaragua to Cuba . The continuing C.I.A . effort to train Syrian rebels is just the latest example of an American president becoming enticed by the prospect of using the spy agency to covertly arm and train rebel groups .
An internal C.I.A . study has found that it rarely works .
The still-classified review , one of several C.I.A . studies commissioned in 2012 and 2013 in the midst of the Obama administration 's protracted debate about whether to wade into the Syrian civil war , concluded that many past attempts by the agency to arm foreign forces covertly had a minimal impact on the long-term outcome of a conflict . They were even less effective , the report found , when the militias fought without any direct American support on the ground .
The findings of the study , described in recent weeks by current and former American government officials , were presented in the White House Situation Room and led to deep skepticism among some senior Obama administration officials about the wisdom of arming and training members of a fractured Syrian opposition .
But in April 2013 , President Obama authorized the C.I.A . to begin a program to arm the rebels at a base in Jordan , and more recently the administration decided to expand the training mission with a larger parallel Pentagon program in Saudi Arabia to train “ vetted ” rebels to battle fighters of the Islamic State , with the aim of training approximately 5,000 rebel troops per year .
I really like this years receiver class .
Who would n't ?
The need for a big wide out kind of goes hand-in-hand with what 's available . Mike Evans , Brandon Coleman , Kelvin Benjamin . It 's a good year to want a pure # 1 receiver .
Yet there 's another thought I ca n't get out of my head .
Would n't it make sense to continue to add to this defense , with the intention of making it even better ?
The performance against Denver will go down as one of the best in Super Bowl history , mainly due to the way Seattle shut down such a prolific offense .
But I get the feeling this defense has n't even peaked yet .
And with one or two further additions they could get even better .
Why not ?
Here 's the argument for going defense in round one this year .
1 . The defense is the identity
It feels like the Legion of Boom is n't just about four guys any more , or even just the secondary unit .
It 's the whole team .
They hit Peyton Manning , they hit the receivers and running backs . They all laid the boom in the Super Bowl .
In 10-15 years time there 's every chance people will still be talking about Seattle 's ‘ L.O.B. ' . Even if they do n't win another title , they left a mark last Sunday .
Keeping the defense at the forefront of what Seattle is about could keep this franchise right at the top .
2 . The current pass rush is n't tied up
There 's actually a fair amount of short termism about the defensive line .
Michael Bennett is a free agent this year . So is Tony McDaniel and Clinton McDonald .
Cliff Avril 's contract only runs through 2014 . Red Bryant and Brandon Mebane wo n't be around forever , while Chris Clemons could be a cap casualty this off-season .
The entire pass rush could look totally different in two seasons time .
Throwing a cheap , late first round talent into the mix who 's guaranteed to be here for at least four years might not be such a bad idea .
In fact it could be an absolute necessity .
3 . The offense is already pretty good
Amid all the media noise of ‘ mediocrity ' , it 's easy to forget Seattle 's offense ranked # 7 in DVOA in 2013 .
Owning a top-ten unit with this defense basically means Championship football .
If they re-sign Golden Tate and tender Doug Baldwin , they 'll essentially be keeping the same group of receivers that won a Super Bowl .
The running game is n't going anywhere , even if we 're looking at maybe only another year or two out of Marshawn Lynch at their very best .
They 've already started to make contingency plans there by drafting Christine Michael and they might see more time with Robert Turbin next season .
Russell Wilson is only going to keep getting better .
It 's not like Seattle has to desperately upgrade the offense this off-season .
4 . Percy time
There 's no guarantee Percy Harvin will be fully healthy in 2014 , but this team made a significant investment in them a year ago .
Clearly they believe over the long term they can take this offense to another level .
And they can , if he 's on the field .
Harvin 's presence alone will be significant . He 's a big-time X-Factor and one of the game 's truly elite players when he 's out there .
The fact they did n't feature much at all in 2013 almost makes them a new addition for next season .
Harvin , Tate , Baldwin , Kearse and Lockette .
Looks good to me , however much I 'd like to add an Evans , Coleman or Benjamin to the group .
5 . Is LEO a need ?
Avril has one more year . Clemons could be a goner . Benson Mayowa is still a bit of an unknown .
Bruce Irvin , once touted as the “ ideal LEO ” by Pete Carroll , has now made a permanent switch to linebacker .
This could be a long term need for the Seahawks .
Aside from that , you can never have too many pass rushers .
This might be a good time to add another edge player . They would n't be under too much pressure to have an instant impact .
And Seattle needs to save some money somewhere , because it might be difficult to re-sign Avril in a year .
6 . The NFC West aint going anywhere
This division really is scary when it comes to defense .
The Rams have their two fierce edge rushers in Chris Long and Robert Quinn .
The Cardinals had the second best unit in the league according to DVOA and leaned on their defense to win in Seattle .
The 49ers have a loaded front seven and enough picks in the upcoming draft to improve their secondary .
At the same time all three teams have some issues on offense .
St. Louis is still hoping Sam Bradford can be the answer .
Arizona is going to be starting Carson Palmer again next season , in is 35th year after throwing 22 interceptions in 2013 .
And the Niners have to be hoping Colin Kaepernick continues to develop as a passer , to go with their electrifying athletic qualities .
It 's basically a division where defense is king .
As much as we want to believe adding another receiver or offensive lineman to Seattle 's roster will help , I 'm not sure you 'll ever have it easy against these teams .
It 's a war of attrition in the west , based around great defense .
Keeping the Legion of Boom at the top of the pack could be vital going forward .
Of course , there are counters to this debate as well . The obvious one being the only way to combat these great defenses is to keep giving more weapons to Russell Wilson or improving the offensive line .
Despite my preference to mock a receiver to Seattle in recent weeks , I firmly believe continuing to stockpile defensive lineman would also be a good idea .
If the Seahawks pass on a big receiver at # 32 or even with their first two picks — I would n't bat an eyelid .
Especially if they continue to pump up the defense .
At the combine we should be looking at tall defensive lineman with length and long arms . Speed helps , but probably is n't vital if we 're talking interior guys .
I would n't rule out a player like Aaron Donald either , who really jump off the tape even if they lack ideal size .
With the LEO prospects speed matters much more , but length is also important . Hand-use is also a crucial and underrated aspect — just look at the way Avril turned on the bull rush in the post season to great effect .
Aside from the players I 've already spent considerable time on ( Brent Urban , Ra-Shede Hageman ) I intend to take a closer look at Jeremiah Attaochu , Kony Ealy , Stephon Tuitt ( who 's never really impressed me so far ) and a few others before the combine .
It 's not a great class for defensive lineman by any means , but there are some interesting options for Seattle . I 'm particularly high on Virginia 's Urban and I like the upside of Hageman .
Just as it did with AT & T 's One X , HTC is pushing out an update for the Sprint Evo 4G LTE that updates its custom Sense software to version 4.1 . As Android Central reports , the main user-facing feature is a new setting that allows you to disable the `` three-dot bar '' for menus and instead map the menu button to a long-press of the multitasking button , saving precious screen real estate . Quick settings should also make an appearance in the notification area , along with the usual bugfixes , an update to Google Wallet , and an update to Visual Voicemail . Unfortunately , this is n't the 4.1 that most people are hoping for right now ( that would be Android 4.1 , not Sense 4.1 ) , but at least you 'll be able to reclaim some pixels while you wait . The OTA update has been rolling out since this morning and should be available now , you can see the very short changelog on Sprint 's forums .
DURHAM—Ontario 's College of Teachers has revoked the licences of two educators who admitted to professional misconduct involving sexual relationships with teenagers . In decisions rendered earlier this year , the college said both teachers had admitted to the misconduct .
Raymond Hubbard of Ajax pleaded guilty in June to a single count of luring a child to facilitate sexual interference and was sentenced to 115 days in jail , after which they are to be placed on probation for two years . Their teaching licence has been revoked .
In one instance , a teacher with the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board acknowledged having entered into a years-long sexual relationship with a male student . That teacher retired after being charged in 2015 . In the other case a male teacher , who was sentenced to jail time after admitting to luring a child on the internet , did not contest revocation of their licence . In a decision rendered in May the college found Raymond Hubbard , who had been employed by the Durham District School Board , had acted in a disgraceful and dishonourable fashion when they pursued an online relationship with someone they thought was a 14-year-old girl in late 2015 and early 2016 .

Hubbard , at the time 52 and a Grade 1 teacher at Terry Fox Public School in Ajax , had come to the attention of police in Michigan after engaging a young person there in online chats , said the record . American authorities alerted police in Durham Region and an officer posing as a 14-year-old girl began chatting online with Hubbard . The exchanges quickly became sexualized with Hubbard asking for pictures of the person they thought was a teenager and ultimately seeking a meeting with her , said a statement of facts entered into the record during their disciplinary process . Durham police arrested Hubbard in January of 2016 . In June of 2016 , Hubbard pleaded guilty to one count of luring a child and was sentenced to a year in jail , followed by two years probation . In a written decision the college 's disciplinary panel characterized Hubbard 's behaviour as “ disturbing. ” “ It is particularly disgraceful that ( Hubbard ) would engage is such egregious behaviour when they are a teacher who is entrusted with the protection of children , ” the ruling states .
In a ruling issued in June , the college revoked the licence of Heather Elizabeth Earl , who was a teacher at John M. James Public School in Bowmanville at the time they were charged in April of 2015 . Earl admitted to engaging in an ongoing sexual relationship with a male student between January of 1996 and December of 1999 ; the student was 15 and Earl 42 when the relationship began , but the teen was not a student at Earl 's school at the time , the record notes .

At one point Earl paid the student $ 200,000 not to report the relationship to police , said a statement of facts . The student contacted Durham police in April of 2015 and Earl was charged with sexual assault and sexual exploitation . The charges were withdrawn at the request of the Crown in March of 2016 , said court records . Earl retired in September of 2015 , the college said . During the disciplinary process Earl agreed to sanctions including a reprimand and revocation of their teaching licence , said the decision .
BLUFF , San Juan County— Situated beneath towering twin sandstone pillars that are symbolic of the Hero Twins of the Navajo , the Twin Rocks Trading Post , where the specialty of the house is fine Navajo art , has a setting as unforgettable as it is fitting .
But Steve Simpson , who owns the trading post along with their brothers Craig and Barry , will be the first to tell you that in this case , location , location , location is not enough .
The reason why Twin Rocks , located on a two-lane highway in a quiet town of 258 people six or more hours from any big city , has evolved into one of the world 's most distinguished purveyors of elegant Southwestern art has considerably less to do with its spectacular physical surroundings than with something that 's completely invisible .
The World Wide Web .
`` Social media , '' Steve says as they relax in their shop among a dizzying array of high-end jewelry , rugs and baskets , `` it 's a lifesaver . ''
Case in point : At the moment , there 's not a customer in the store . And in the dead of winter , there may not be one for hours .
But art lovers are still shopping at www.twinrocks.com – the address that never closes .
`` The Internet allows us to get to a much larger market , '' says Steve . `` The web is essential in keeping the business viable . ''
And essential in supporting hundreds of talented Southwestern artists whose wares make up the enviable Twin Rocks inventory . The majority of them are Navajo , along with others from the Ute , Zuni and Hopi tribes , and even a few Anglos ( `` We always say that we do n't discriminate against the white folk , '' smiles Steve ) .
`` We try to do what the old-time trading posts did , '' says Steve . `` Support the local economy and culture . ''
But in a new-time trading post kind of way .
When Twin Rocks was first established 23 years ago , the business plan did not include the Internet .
Basically , it was the striking 15-story tall sandstone structure – the Hero Twins – that begat the business .
Steve , Barry and Craig 's dad , Duke Simpson , bought the land at the base of the pillar and thought it would be a terrific location to attract customers . For years , Duke had operated ( and still operates ) a family-run trading post in nearby Blanding called Blue Mountain . They invited the whole family to get involved in the new project . Steve left a promising career as a tax attorney in northern California to lend a hand .
When Twin Rocks opened in October 1989 , it had a modest inventory and an equally modest number of contributing local artists .
The plan was to attract business the way business had always been attracted – as it passed on the highway .
But the plan changed because of one of the store 's new employees : a young self-taught graphic artist named Damian Jim .
Damian was a Indian who lived with their grandmother on the edge of Bluff in a house that had no electricity .
At night , though , after work , Damian would hook up their computer to their car battery and connect to the world . By the light of a kerosene lamp , they became acquainted with a marketplace of unlimited dimensions .
One day in the early 1990s , they said to Steve and their brothers : `` You guys should get a Web site . ''
Steve and their brothers : `` Get a what ? ''
Simpson never tires of telling that story – how a Navajo teenager with no electricity introduced their family to the Internet Age , and saved the trading post . It 's a legend that one day might elbow its way in among the legend of the Hero Twins . In Navajo lore , the twins , one called Monster Slayer , the other Born For Water , were the result of a relationship between the Sun and Mother Earth . They are the redeemers of the Navajo people and are held in deep reverence .
The Twin Rocks behind the trading post are emblematic of the Hero Twins . They 're impossible to miss as you drive into Bluff – located west of the two-lane on the north end of town .

Either way , they provide a remarkable ancient backdrop for the modern , socially mobile business that sits just beneath .
The choice to allow players to carry decisions through multiple games has always been what defined Mass Effect . As early as the first game , what made the system of choices so engaging was the promise that every single decision the player made was going to culminate in one giant , magical ending that wrapped up one 's own , personal story of Commander Shepherd and the reapers .
It 's now seeming like it was all setup and no payoff .
Players are up in arms over Mass Effect 3 's ending for one reason : despite the promise of choice , the overwhelming internet voice is saying that no matter what decisions the player made over their or their 5 year history as Commander Shepherd , things ended up more or less the same .
It defines a struggle that Mass Effect has had since the beginning : allowing for player choice in the confines of what amounts to a linear story .
For me , the cracks in the illusion of choice became apparent as early as ME1 : I was always frustrated with the way it shoehorned the player into the same old binary moral system : paragon and renegade , blue and red , good and evil . Or at least mean . I remember trying to play the first game with an even hand , and then I found that the game forced me to kill a squad member because I had n't committed to either track .
It would seem that the developers had made a lot of improvements in the second game – some of those dialogue restrictions were smoothed out , and paragon and renegade interrupters made the choices feel much more fluid . The peak of the illusion of player control came at the end of ME2 , when the player 's decisions really did determine the fates of every last crewmember aboard .
The binary system , for its restrictions , allowed players to shape a character that reflected their decisions , and for a while the writers struck a great balance . They let players take ownership of their character while keeping the narrative driving forward . They chose a lousy time to let it slip .
At the end of the game , player control seemed to fall totally out of the equation . The choices the player made throughout 100 hours of gameplay do n't have any effect , and a few eleventh hour decisions make all the small difference that 's available .
Kotaku 's Luke Plunkett puts it well :
It feels like walking 100 miles to get lemonade only to get there and be told you can choose between a pair of shoes , some brass knuckles or a cheeseburger .
It 's unclear what happened -- time constraints or pressure from EA could have forced the team to rush an ending that should have had more time to develop . The need to make the game as friendly to new players as it was returning players could have played a factor . The impossible challenge of writing the infinte permutations of player choices into meaningful endings may have been too much . It 's also possible that the writers wanted this moment for themselves .
Love hurts . it 's a testament to player investment in the story that the ending has proved so rabidly divisive . Director Casey Hudson has alluded to the fact that fan reaction is going to play a role in DLC , but it seems unlikely that large changes will be made in the ending . It 's unclear how much that would help anything , or whether it should even happen . It 's already gone sour .

Orphaned at the age of four in war-torn Sierra Leone and left in an orphanage by their uncle , Michaela dePrince refused to give up hope and is now a professional ballerina with the Dutch National Ballet . Here Michaela tells us why they wrote a book about their life for teenagers
I was born in 1995 in Sierra Leone , in the middle of a war . At the age of four I lost my parents and my uncle chose to leave me in an orphanage . Due a skin condition called vitiligo I was called the Devil 's Child , and was very unhappy .
When the wind blew a magazine with a picture of a ballet dancer onto the orphanage gates , they looked so happy that I promised myself that I 'd be a ballerina one day . I was adopted soon after by my mother and father , Elaine and Charles DePrince , along with my best friend .
Once we moved to the US my mother enrolled me in ballet classes to help make my dream a reality . I am now a dancer with the Dutch National Ballet . In 2014 , 15 years after my adoption , my mother and I coauthored my memoirs . The real-life characters in the book played an important role in my life . Here I acknowledge them…

Though ballet is my passion and dream , it would not be entirely fair to say that it saved me , without acknowledging the human beings who played major roles in saving my life .
Some of these people I loved ; others I detested . But if it were not for them , I would not have a life , let alone be a ballerina .
First came the African mother , who loved me enough to give me their food while they were starving . Then there was my mean Uncle Abdullah . Though they hated me , they felt enough responsibility for me to leave me at an orphanage , rather than sell me to a cacao plantation as child labour , or leave me in the streets to starve .
Uncle Sulaiman , a humble but brave night watchman , who barely knew me , risked their own life and said , “ Please do not kill her , they are just a poor orphan pikin , ” as they lifted me out of the hands of a band of debils ( rebels ) .
Of course , I will never forget Papa Andrew and Uncle Ali . Though they were motivated by money , and they were not the nicest men , they did lead me out of the horror of the war in Sierra Leone and into the arms of a loving mother .
My American mother and father dedicated their lives to their children . It is with their love and guidance that I adjusted to my new life in America . When my mother learned of my passion for ballet , they convinced my father to support this .
Together they poured their time , energy , and life savings into helping my dream come true . They gave me encouragement and emotional support through the difficult years of training . They did this when I was only four-years-old , and they are still the steady source of my emotional support at age 20
Last but not least among those who saved me , is the little girl who was my constant companion in the orphanage , Mabinty Suma . We were both adopted by our mother . They are now a college student , a musician , and an actor . But best of all they are my beloved sister , Mia DePrince , and they are still there for me now .
They are the first person I telephone when I have news to share . They listen to my woes , and celebrates my successes .
Ballet brings me joy ! It is my dream-come-true . It is the way I express my emotions . It helped keep me out of trouble as a kid , and fulfils me as an adult . It is the source of my success .
But to say that it has saved me is not true , because I needed to be saved long before I arrived at my first ballet class . I want to share this so that other young people will appreciate those in their lives , good and bad , who have prodded them onward and upward toward their goals .
For as John Donne , the English poet once wrote , “ No man is an island entire of itself… ” In other words , you ca n't make it alone in life . I certainly did n't .

A former medical school student from Dauphin , Man. , whose mental illness forced them to drop out of university is rejecting a settlement offer that would have reduced their $ 170,000 debt to the Royal Bank of Canada by 90 per cent .
Bryan Robson , 26 , filed a human rights complaint after RBC sued them for $ 170,000 for an unpaid student line of credit .
The Canadian Human Rights Commission has been negotiating with RBC and reached a settlement offer of $ 17,000 in November , which Robson recently refused to accept .
They hope that by instead sharing the details of the offer , they can help other students who are ill and owe money to the bank .
`` To me that information was more valuable . That 's why I would n't accept it . And I do n't have $ 17,000 . Nor do I think they [ the bank ] deserve it , '' they said .
Robson got an RBC line of credit when they started studies at the University of Saskatchewan 's medical school in 2012 , knowing they would n't be able to afford the $ 14,000 per year for tuition , books and living expenses .
But two years into their program , they started experiencing intense anxiety and depression . They were eventually diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and had to leave the program for good .
When the bank pursued litigation to retrieve the money he 'd borrowed on their line of credit , Robson went to the Canadian Human Rights Commission , citing discrimination based on disability . They said an RBC employee told them after they dropped out of the program that the disability insurance he 'd signed up for covered physical , but not mental , illness .
They also later learned that insurance for the line of credit also only applied if they were working .
`` The disability insurance should 've protected me , '' they said .
Human Rights Commission negotiates settlement
In the spring , the Human Rights Commission negotiated with RBC to get the repayment amount lowered to $ 50,000 . But Robson said that amount , too , was insurmountable for him .
`` I felt helpless , I felt trapped , I felt not listened to , I felt further victimized , I suppose . ''
In November , after more negotiations between the Human Rights Commission and RBC , the repayment amount dropped to $ 17,000 . Robson said a family member even offered to cover that amount for him .
Bryan Robson says they had to drop out of medical school after being diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder . They say an RBC employee told them after they dropped out of the program that the disability insurance he 'd signed up for on their line of credit covered physical , but not mental , illness . ( CBC )
`` It did n't feel right just to let them dig me out of it . It came down to a matter of integrity , '' they said .
Instead , Robson asked that their file with the Human Rights Commission be sent to the commission 's investigations unit , which will withdraw the offer of settlement , allowing RBC to proceed with action to collect the money it says Robson owes .
From the investigations stage , their file will either be dismissed , referred to a tribunal for a public hearing , or go to a conciliator who will negotiate a new settlement between Robson and the bank .
Insurance covers mental , physical disabilities : RBC
In a statement , a spokesperson for RBC wrote , `` We recognize that this is a difficult situation for Mr. Robson . We have worked extensively with them to negotiate a repayment plan and remain open to resolving this matter . ''
The spokesperson said that the RBC creditor disability insurance coverage covers both mental and physical disabilities , and applicants are made aware of eligibility requirements . RBC says clients are advised of their coverage again after the line of credit has been approved .
However , for some insurance , clients are only eligible for disability coverage if they are working a minimum number of hours per week at the time of the application , the spokesperson wrote .
Robson counters not enough information of the risk was shared with them when they signed up for the line of credit , and they were not able to work when they left the program because of their illness .
`` These details were not in the documents I signed . These details were not adequately purveyed to me by the agents of the RBC , '' said Robson .
Outdoor serenity
Robson has been living in a trailer on an acreage in the Kootenay region of British Columbia . They enjoy the outdoors and writing — he 's already written one book about their journey with their illness .
Though they find their surroundings offer them peace and serenity , and their pet dog also helps stabilize their moods , it 's not easy . Without being able to work , their family helps them out financially , but they often rely on the food bank and has also been homeless for periods .
`` It 's no secret that debt is crippling and debilitating and psychologically terrorizing . So they could 've let me go to simplify it . After two years , by now I could 've worked , '' they said .
They hope their case is referred to a tribunal , so that the details become public . They want an apology from RBC and for the bank to update its policies on how it informs students applying for lines of credit of exactly what the disability insurance covers .
`` If I had the money and I was n't basically homeless and hungry all the time , I might think differently . That might be different . At the end of the day , when I was 21 and signed that policy , I had no choice , '' they said .
They do n't want the details of their case kept hidden , which was a condition of the offer as well , which they say is part of why he 's choosing to share them .
`` Those people , if this information makes them realize that they 're not as trapped as they might think they are , that 's why it 's valuable . It 's about humanism , activism . Those things they show us when we go to medical school , '' they said .
`` It 's especially valuable to me for the people who might … be in dark places . People who are at risk of self-harm . And those people , if this information makes them believe they 're not as trapped as they might think they are , that 's why it 's valuable , '' they said .
`` It 's never as bad as you think it is , ever . ''
The former Ukip leader revealed the White House hopeful spoke in glowing terms about the Brexiteer after they shared a stage together . They spoke of their disbelief when being told the billionaire themselves would be introducing them at a US rally . Speaking on LBC Radio today , Mr Farage added : “ It is clear Hillary Clinton absolutely hates me , and I 'm pleased about that . “ I think it 's good to have enemies like Hillary Clinton . ”

The Democratic nominee described the pivotal Brexit figure as a `` right-wing leader '' after they said they would not vote for them “ even if they were paid to do so ” . Speaking about their recent trip to the US where they appeared at a rally with Mr Trump in Mississippi , Mr Farage said : “ Brexit is not just something that affects the United Kingdom , it is n't just something that affects the rest of Europe , this is a global event . “ This is the first time a country has reasserted its rights as a democratic self-governing nation .
GETTY Mr Farage indicated that Mrs Clinton was likely to be among the protest
“ Brexit is very much a part of this American debate , so I went there and said what I said and I was supported by Trump and really very roundly condemned by Hillary. ” Mr Farage also spoke about the March for Europe happening today as hundreds of thousands of Remainers are set to demonstrate in London , Birmingham , and Edinburgh . The key figure in the Leave movement dismissed the gatherings as a gaggle of ‘ remoaners ' .

Mr Farage said : “ I 'll tell you what 's really interesting , is that this march today in London , I bet you that the vast majority of people on this march will be under 30-years-old . “ And yet across the rest of Europe the demonstrations from the under-30s are against the European Union , against open borders and against the currency. ” The march has been scheduled to tie in with the anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War , and is demanding a pause in Brexit discussions .

And when criticising the protests on UK streets , Mr Farage said they thought Mrs Clinton would protest if they were in the UK . They said : “ If Hillary was in London , she 'd probably be on this march today , she 'd probably be speaking . `` She 'd be there with Eddie Izzard and all these other great luminaries. “ And Hillary thinks that Brexit is a huge mistake , Trump thinks its one of the greatest things to have happened in modern history . ”
“ And Hillary thinks that Brexit is a huge mistake , Trump thinks its one of the greatest things to have happened in modern history. ” In London , the March for Europe is starting at Park Lane before making its way to Westminster . Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated the Government will not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty , which begins the formal process of leaving the EU , until after 2017 .
LBC The outgoing Ukip leader dismissed the gatherings as a gaggle of ‘ remoaners '
But there have been repeated calls for a second referendum after the close vote , 52 to 48 per cent , voted to leave the EU on June 23 . Mrs May has been forced to confirm on several occasions that “ Brexit means Brexit ” , and there is no possibility of remaining in the EU .
The agreement , which was welcomed by the Arab League on Friday , bolsters economic and military ties between the two countries , Taimur Khan reports .
NEW YORK // The Arab League on Friday welcomed the signing of a pact that bolsters military and economic ties between Egypt and Saudi Arabia .
The agreement , signed on Thursday , was aimed at underscoring the strategic importance of the countries ' relationship as Riyadh seeks to rally Sunni Arab support to counter Iran and fight extremist groups .
Arab League secretary general Dr Nabil Al Arabi said the agreement reflects progress towards further joint Arab military action and would contribute to discussions at the upcoming Arab defence ministers meeting on August 27 .
Saudi Arabia 's defence minister and deputy crown prince , Mohammed bin Salman , had led a delegation to Cairo and met with Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El Sisi .
Thursday 's agreement , which the leaders called the “ Cairo Declaration ” , pledges increased military cooperation , including the formation of a joint Arab military force for interventions in regional crises , and for increased economic ties through “ mutual investment ” in energy and transport .
“ At this current period which the Arab world is facing , we need to work together , because the threats are many , and we will not overcome them unless we work together , ” Mr El Sisi said . “ Egypt and Saudi Arabia are the two pillars of Arab national security , and together we can confront these challenges . ”
Since the removal of the Muslim Brotherhood-backed Egyptian president , Mohammed Morsi , Saudi Arabia and the UAE have given billions of dollars in aid and investment to Cairo , viewing the country 's stability as key to overall regional stability and their national interests .
But a number of recent public differences over regional issues have led some to perceive growing tension between Riyadh and Cairo . Prince Muhammed 's visit was intended to send a message that the core strategic interests and relationship between the allies remains unshaken , observers said .
“ I think the visit was designed to end speculation and open a new public page , ” said Mustafa Alani , a security analyst with close ties to Riyadh . “ They recognise that Egypt has different views and possibly interests in a number of regional issues but they still believe that on the strategic objective there is no disagreement . ”
Under the new leadership of King Salman , Riyadh 's regional policy has taken a different direction than under their predecessor and focused on banding together Sunni forces in the region to counter Iran 's projection of power .
“ The adoption of a reappraisal with respect to regional policy has affected [ Saudi ties with ] Egypt , ” said Michael Hanna , an expert on Egyptian and Gulf policy at The Century Foundation think tank in New York .
Saudi Arabia has taken a more pragmatic stance toward Brotherhood-affiliated groups in places like Yemen and Syria , and has recently courted Hamas , possibly to turn its back on Tehran . This has strained relations with Egypt , the analysts said , as did Cairo 's refusal to participate in ground operations against Houthi rebels in Yemen .
Mr El Sisi 's government has also taken a different position on Syria and is primarily concerned with the proliferation of militancy there , with little interest in backing rebels to overthrow the Al Assad regime . The Egyptian foreign ministry this week condemned the Turkish “ safe zones ” plan as a breach of Syrian sovereignty .
Despite this , both Egypt and Saudi Arabia have an underlying interest in maintaining their close ties that trumps the recent differences over regional policy .
“ We have n't seen any of these differences yet affect the strategic logic of the bilateral relationship , ” Mr Hanna said . “ Both parties realise they need the other for various things and this trip was a kind of relationship tending exercise . ”

When you tweet–even if you tweet under a pseudonym–how much do you reveal about yourself ? More than you realize , argues a new paper from researchers at the Mitre Corporation . The paper , “ Discriminating Gender on Twitter , ” which is being presented this week at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing in Scotland , demonstrates that machines can often figure out a person 's gender on Twitter just by reading their tweets . And such knowledge is power : the findings could be useful to advertisers and others .
To conduct their research , the Mitre folks–John Burger , John Henderson , George Kim , and Guido Zarrella–first had to assemble a corpus of Twitter users whose gender they were confident of . Since Twitter does n't demand that users specify gender , they narrowed their focus to Twitter users who had linked to major blog sites in which they had filled out that information . In addition to collecting the tweets of these folks–many users had only tweeted once , while one of them had tweeted 4,000 times–Burger et al . collected the minimal profile data that Twitter users sometimes do include : screen name , full name , location , URL , and description .
The dataset was about 55 % female , 45 % male ( which squares roughly with estimates of Twitter 's overall gender breakdown ) . Thus , by guessing “ female ” for every user , a computer would be right 55 % of the time . Simply by examining the full name of the user , a computer was accurate about 89 % of the time–a remarkable improvement , if not an especially interesting one , since first names are highly predictive of gender . The Mitre findings become intriguing , though , when the team limited its analysis to tweets alone . By scanning for patterns in all the tweets of a given user , Mitre 's program was able to guess the correct gender 75.8 % of the time–a 20 % improvement over the baseline . And even just by analyzing a single tweet of a user , it was right 65.9 % of the time–an over 10 % improvement over the baseline .
Here , from the paper , is a table breaking down how various combinations of data helped boost the gender prediction success rate :
How is this possible ? How can we give away so much with 140 characters or fewer ? There is a whole branch of study called “ sociolinguistics ” that observes that different people speak differently . In the real world , for example , sociolinguists have found that women tend to laugh more than men . In the last few years , computational linguists like those at Mitre have sought to determine to what extent that research translates into cyberspace . They use a technique called n-gramming . Given a certain sequence of characters , or words , what is the likelihood that the speaker is , for instance , male or female ?
Mitre found that given certain characters or combinations of characters , the computer could wisely bet on the gender of the tweeter . The mere fact of a tweet containing an exclamation mark or a smiley face meant that odds were a woman was tweeting , for instance . Of the most gender-skewed words , the majority were in the female category , while only a few were male , leading to this unintentionally hilarious figure from the Mitre paper :
Toronto police homicide investigators are asking the public to help identify two `` persons of interest '' after a man and woman were killed in two separate brazen shootings at the Muzik nightclub .
Homicide Insp . Peter Moreira said gunfire erupted at the nightclub around 3:20 a.m. Tuesday , where some 4,000 people were attending an after-party for Toronto rapper Drake 's OVO Fest .
Moreira revealed little about the two persons of interest , but described them both as young men .
The first man is described as a black male , six feet to six feet one inch tall , about 25 or 26 years old with a fresh buzzcut . They were wearing a purple crewneck sweater and dark blue jeans .
Previous Next The second man , who was last seen near the Dufferin Gates , is described as a brown-skinned male , five feet 10 inches or five feet 11 inches tall with a skinny build , between 24 and 28 years of age . They were wearing a yellow and burgundy plaid button-up shirt .
Tuesday 's violence consisted of two separate shootings , and investigators have yet to definitively link the two .
Moreira said paid-duty officers raced into the club when they heard the first gunshots and found a male on the patio with gunshot wounds . They were later pronounced dead at the scene .
Two more victims , a man and a woman , were found with gunshot wounds just outside the patio 's fence and were taken to hospital . Another male victim , who was believed to be at the club , made their way to Dufferin and College streets — about two kilometres from Muzik — before flagging down a passing ambulance for assistance .
As patrons fled the club , located at Toronto 's Exhibition Place , there was a second shooting at the nearby Dufferin Gates . An officer on a bicycle was the first to respond and administer CPR to a female victim . They were transported to hospital , where they later died .
The woman who died north of the Dufferin Gates did not appear to have played a role in the events that led up to the gunfire , Moreira said .
Police have not yet identified either of the two shooting victims who died .
The other shooting victims who were hospitalized are expected to survive .
2nd year of shooting at OVO after-party
The shootings mark the second year in a row gunfire has marred the OVO Fest after-party .
Police described Drake 's annual festival at the nearby Molson Canadian Amphitheatre as well run , but said more officers were called as crowds swelled near the after-party .
When asked whether Drake was in the club at the time of the shooting , Moreira said that was not included in the scope of the police investigation .
The rapper has not commented on the shooting , despite multiple requests from CBC News .
One man was hospitalized after a shooting last year outside the same event .
Police seek witnesses , pictures
Toronto police say they 've spoken with an `` extremely small percentage '' of those who were in the club and urged people to come forward and help investigators figure out what triggered the violence .
Toronto Deputy Chief Peter Sloly said there were extra officers deployed at the scene ahead of the shooting that killed two people . ( CBC ) Police are asking anyone who took pictures or video at any time during the night to provide it to investigators . Moreira would not directly answer a question about surveillance cameras inside the club , except to say that video evidence is `` always important '' to an investigation .
As dawn broke over the area , police cordoned off an extensive crime scene , shutting down multiple streets in the area .
One area resident said they heard two gunshots shortly after 3 a.m. `` and it was just mayhem after that . ''
Deputy Chief Peter Sloly said that considering how packed the nightclub was , the shooting could have been worse .
​ '' We 're lucky there was n't a larger body count , '' said Sloly . `` We have a brazen set of individuals who are willing to put lives at risk . ''
In a Twitter message , Mayor John Tory said they are `` saddened and angered '' by this `` senseless shooting . ''
In a statement , the owner of Muzik expressed condolences for victims , and `` praised the actions and professionalism of our entire security team . ''
`` We 're absolutely shocked by this horrific attack , '' said Zlatko Starkovski . `` We are fully co-operating with Toronto police and have full confidence they will get to the bottom of this horrific incident , and bring these people to justice . ''
EUGENE -- One of the trio of former Oregon Duck basketball players dismissed by the school after sexual assault allegations may be the first to find a new team .
One year after leaving Philadelphia as a lean , 6-foot-9 top-50 recruit , Brandon Austin is now reportedly headed to Hutchinson Community College in Kansas after leaving both Providence and Oregon on the heels of allegations of sexual assault .
Laura Fine Moro , Austin 's attorney , could not immediately confirm Monday night that Austin had agreed to join the team but did say Austin interviewed last week with the school .
JUCOJunction.com first reported Austin 's plan to land at Hutchinson , a junior college powerhouse that has sent dozens to Division I schools -- including Kadeem Allen , the 2014 junior college player of the year who is headed to Arizona .
Austin and teammates Damyean Dotson and Dominic Artis each were dismissed from the UO basketball team in late April , two weeks after the Lane County District Attorney declined to prosecute them on allegations of sexual assault stemming from a party on March 9 . Though no charges were brought against the players due to insufficient evidence , the three players were barred in June by the university from returning to campus for at least four years , and up to 10 , depending on the length of the alleged assault victim 's studies .
Austin transferred to Oregon in January after being suspended indefinitely by Providence in December . They and a Providence teammate were linked , in March , to an open sexual assault investigation .
Dotson and Artis have yet to find a suitor after two seasons with the Ducks . Artis visited St. Johns in late June before the Red Storm ultimately passed on them reportedly due to concerns stemming from their exit from UO .

Decanter , the self proclaimed “ world 's best wine magazine , ” is “ relaunching ” its Buying Guide section in an attempt to make wine ratings more transparent and therefore useful to its global audience . You can read all about the new tasting panel protocols here .
Three Heads Better Than One
Instead of listing a single rating score for each wine , for example , Decanter will now provide the individual scores of three critics . I was n't sure if this would make much of a difference , but having read through the new issue , I am a fan . Let me take the big review of Rias Baixas Albarino as an example .
Having read the press release , I was expecting to see four numerical scores for each wine ( one for each of the reviews plus the average ) . What I found was a good deal more , however . Each of the three tasters ( regional experts Ferran Centelles , John Radford and Jane Evans in this case ) also provided individual tasting notes for the eight top wines plus summary assessments of the group of wines . ( The wines were apparently spectacularly good — 8 top scores out of 74 wines and 25 designated as good value . )
Each of the tasters also provided notes for their “ top three ” recommended wines and John Radford wrote a brief essay to sum things up . Result : There is a lot of information here and a sense of a wine conversation rather than a monolithic judgment . Great new format .
Global Wine Drinkers Want to Know
For as long as I have been reading Decanter the wine ratings have had three components : a brief but useful tasting note , a numerical rating on a 20 point scale and finally an overall assessment of zero to five stars . Of these three the tasting notes are the most useful for serious study while the star system works well for me as a potential buyer . I 'm not sure I can taste the difference between 15.5 and 16.0 , but knowing what 's Good , Better and Best ( my casual interpretation of three , four and five stars ) is something I can use .
But Decanter 's scoring system has changed . Here 's a quote from the press release .
Perhaps the most significant new feature is the adoption of the 100-point score , to run alongside Decanter 's 20-point score , while the old five-star system has been dropped . Introducing the 100-point system is essential as Decanter is now a global magazine with more than half its readership outside the UK , [ editor Guy Woodward ] says in this month 's editorial . Readers can now ‘ use whichever [ scoring system ] they are more familiar with ' .
Fair enough — although “ essential ” is pretty strong — but I 'm going to miss the simplicity of the old five-star system and I 'm not really sure that I need to have the 20 point British scale translated into a 100 point American equivalent . Converting Decanter scores into Wine Spectator-type figures and back again is n't exactly rocket science ( see the conversation table below ) . But I do n't see any harm in it , especially if , as the Decanter story suggests , the point is to help “ global ” readers who may be unfamiliar with the 20 point system to make sense of the ratings .
Follow the Money : A Modest Proposal
It 's good to step back and rethink things like this every so often , but maybe Decanter 's relaunch did n't go far enough , so in the spirit of Jonathan Swift , I 'd like to offer a “ Modest Proposal ” for future reform .
Here 's my idea . Instead of asking critics to score the wines on a quality scale , let 's ask them how much they are worth ! How much should someone be willing to pay for this wine ?
Wine reviews generally tell us a wine 's price and a score , but what we really want to know is if it 's worth it . That 's the question that a lot of shoppers want answered and the question they are often trying to figure out when they read critic reviews . From a practical standpoint , do n't you think it would be more useful to translate scores into bucks rather than messing around with 20 points versus 100 ?
Yes , yes , I know there are lots of problems . A wine that tastes good enough to sell for $ 20 to you might only taste like it 's worth $ 12 to me . But that 's nothing new — differences in taste and the problem of what economists might call “ interpersonal utility comparisons ” are part and parcel of all wine rating systems .
The Mitt Problem … Solved
Income distribution is a more difficult question , however . Mitt Romney has mega-bucks , so me might be willing to pay a lot more for a given bottle of wine than I would . That would mess up the ratings if they were a wine critic . But , hey , Mitt does n't drink wine , so … problem solved !
There would be lots of benefits to this new system . Easy to use — just compare the price score ( $ 15 ) with the market price and you know if the wine is “ worth it ” or not . Under a set of ridiculously improbable theoretical assumptions that I wo n't explain here because it would put you to sleep , the gap between price and critic-assigned value would be equivalent to the welfare economics concept of “ consumer surplus ” and so the scores would allow consumers to more efficiently maximize utility and achieve a Pareto Optimal resource allocation .
And while this does n't really work in theory , it is how many people behave in practice . How many times have you heard someone brag that their $ 10 wine tastes like it should cost $ 20 ? And although this is a silly thing to say , I believe many people really enjoy the benefit they think they have gained from that value-price gap . So the new system would n't change that way of thinking — just improve it . We 'd be drawing upon expert opinion for judgment rather than our own amateur assessments .
A Crazy Idea
Yes , I know this is crazy , but that 's the point . Jonathan Swift 's original 1729 modest proposal — that the rich should eat the children of starving Irish peasants — was also crazy , but the point was very sane . The cost of food ( due to the high rents that landlords collected , according to the author ) was already killing children in Swift 's day . As they said , the landlords had already “ eaten ” the parents through outrageous prices — might just as well go after the children next .
My wine rating reform is crazy , too . You ca n't use money to rate wine . Wine does n't taste like dollars — it tastes like wine ! But , that 's my point . It does n't taste like dollars , but it does n't taste much like points , either , however useful consumers and producers might find the ratings to be . Hey , do n't get upset . It 's just a modest proposal !
Here 's the Decanter conversation table . Cheers .
HANKSVILLE , Utah — Four people wearing space helmets and square backpacks emerge from a circular structure resembling a water tank and step onto a reddish , barren landscape .
One hikes up a hill to take magnetic readings of the ground with a rectangular apparatus that looks like a large leveling tool . Another pushes a wheelbarrow equipped with sensors arrayed in a zig-zag pattern .
For a group of six Belgian college students , it 's just another simulated day on Mars .
This rocky corner of Utah bears such a resemblance to the red planet that it 's become a hot spot for scientists and engineers to run imaginary missions to Earth 's neighbor . They 've been coming here for more than a decade , hoping their research someday helps put humans on the Martian surface .
This site and others that allow crews to mimic interplanetary missions are helping to raise buzz about Mars to an all-time high as advancements in science and engineering convince space enthusiasts that the 140-million-mile trip is a realistic possibility in this century .
The research center is run by the nonprofit Mars Society , an advocacy group that believes getting people to Mars to be the great challenge of our time . The group is not affiliated with NASA or the federal government .
“ What we are doing on Mars is beginning humanity 's career as a space-faring species , a multi-planet species , ” said Robert Zubrin , Mars Society director . “ This is about extending the human reach from one world to many worlds . ”
On May 5 , the third annual Humans to Mars Summit kicks off in Washington D.C. , with about 800 attendees expected and as many as a quarter million more watching webcasts , said Chris Carberry , executive director of the organization that puts on the summit , Explore Mars Inc .
“ There 's never been so much support for sending humans to Mars , ” said Carberry , who remembers congressional staffers rolling their eyes when they pitched the idea in the late 1990s while working for the Mars Society .
NASA administrator Charles Bolden said recently in a congressional hearing that the space agency 's plan is to get people to Mars in the 2030s .
Private companies are trying to beat NASA by getting people there first . Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk 's company , SpaceX , plans to unveil concepts for Mars colonization later this year . Richard Branson 's company , Virgin Galactic , has also discussed a trip to Mars .
The Belgian students are the 153rd group in the last 14 years to travel to this outpost for a two-week mission .
None of the six are interested in going to Mars without a guarantee of a safe return .
“ I could die for science , but at 70 years old and not at 30 , ” said Romain Compare , now 23 . “ I do n't want to die without oxygen and thousands of kilometers from my home with no one to love me . ”
Compare and their five classmates beat out 34 other students at their university to be chosen for the crew . The Mars Society charged each of them $ 1,000 for the mission , which the students paid by getting a grant from NASA and donations from their university and several Belgian science companies , said Bastien Mathurin , the commander .
Like other groups , each person fills a role that the Mars Society believes will be integral to a real mission . There is a commander , sub-commander , astronomer , geologist , biologist , journalist and engineer/mechanic .
The teams hold close to the most important rule of the mission : Simulate everything as authentically as possible . They never go outside without space helmets . When entering and leaving , they wait several minutes in a fake decompression room between the outside door and inside of the habitat . At least one person must always stay behind in case something goes wrong , and they never go outside alone . They cook with freeze-dried foods or other dry goods .
The place where they live and sleep is called “ the habitat. ” From the outside , it looks like a giant water tank . Inside , it has two levels , with six narrow bedrooms upstairs and a bathroom , shower and work station downstairs . It 's basic , but for two weeks everybody gets along fine , Mathurin said . They planted the Belgian flag in the ground outside .
“ We 're trying to write the book of field tactics for Mars explorers , ” Zubrin said . “ We do not expect that the people in our crews will be the actual people that go to Mars … We 're trying to discover how the Mars mission crew should be trained . ”
The training helps illustrate the logistical and emotional issues that a Mars mission would confront , they said .
The Colorado-based Mars Society first built an Arctic training station in 2000 on Devon Island in the Canadian territory of Nunavut but soon realized it was logistically cumbersome to get crews there .
That triggered a search for a desert site in the American Southwest . The site in Utah was chosen because it looks like Mars and was reasonably close to airports . Located just outside the tiny community of Hanksville , the site is a four-hour drive from Salt Lake City or 2.5 hours from Grand Junction , Colorado .
Since 2001 , the Mars Society has spent about $ 1 million on the desert research center to build the habitat , rent the land and pay for supplies and upkeep , Zubrin said . The group has been helped by a $ 150,000 in contributions from NASA . The organization also relies on donations and dues from its 7,000 members worldwide .
More than 900 people have participated in missions in Utah , coming from all over the world , including Russia , Romania , Australia and Japan . One in 5 work for NASA , Zubrin said .
The Utah training site is n't the only place to simulate Mars missions .
Last summer , a crew of six scientists spent four months atop a volcano in Hawaii . Several years ago , six foreign researchers spent 520 days in a locked steel capsule in Moscow during a mock flight to Mars .
These training sites offer useful practice , but mainly promote education and public awareness , said Greg Williams , deputy associate administrator for policy in the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate at NASA .
“ That 's been really important , just to keep the buzz going about it , ” Williams said . “ To highlight not only the challenges of getting on Mars and being on Mars but also what we are accomplishing in order to make that happen . ”

Two of Israel 's largest extreme-left groups , B'Tselem and Peace Now , are accused of acting illegally as foreign agents in the United States .
Two of Israel 's largest extreme-left organizations , B'Tselem and Peace Now , have been accused of potentially violating United States law by acting illegally as foreign agents . The U.S. Department of Justice has been informed of the accusations , and is looking into the matter .
The charges were raised by Attorney Lee Bender . Bender first notified the Department of Justice 's National Security Division of the potentially illegal status of Americans for Peace Now in November 2009 . While awaiting the conclusions of the Justice Department , they developed concerns about B'Tselem as well and last week contacted the National Security Division to report in the group .
The Americans for Peace Now group is part of the Isreli left-wing movement that campaigns against a Jewish presence in all of the land restored to Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967 . Its activists often support Arab incitement as part of the `` resistance . '' B'Tselem is a self-acclaimed human rights group that consistently has condemned Israel for counterrorist operations against Hamas and has blamed Israel for most Arab violence.Both organizations use the Israeli Supreme Court as venue for attempting to bring about home demolitions in Judea and Samaria communities and for attempts to indict Israeli civilians and soldiers for what they term unnecessary violence in the face of perceived terrorist threats .
Both organizations are suspected of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act ( FARA ) . The law , enacted in 1938 , requires those acting as agents of foreign principles in a political or quasi-political capacity to disclose their relationship to the foreign principles and their activities .
B'Tselem and Peace Now both receive much of their funding from the European Union and individual European countries . As Bender wrote , “ They have and continue to receive funds from European governments , and have an office in Washington D.C. that lobbies United States officials . ”
If the two organizations are found to be foreign agents under FARA , they will need to report all contact with American officials , as well as for every political activity they organize .
In Israel , organizations funded by foreign governments are required to report the donations they receive to the Non-Profit Associations Registrar . Since 2008 , such groups have been required to make their donations public via the Internet as well .
In 2009 , MK Danny Danon revealed that they plan to criminalize the activities of Peace Now , B'Tselem and similar organizations by making it illegal for foreign-funded groups to engage in political activity inside Israel .

Explanation : The beautiful Trifid Nebula is a cosmic study in contrasts . Also known as M20 , it lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius . A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy , the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae ; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms , blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight , and dark nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette . But the red emission region roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes is what lends the Trifid its popular name . Pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars , below and left of the emission nebula 's center , appear in famous Hubble Space Telescope close-up images of the region . The Trifid Nebula is about 40 light-years across . Just too faint to be seen by the unaided eye , it almost covers the area of the Moon in planet Earth 's sky .

Despite a full-court press defending the supposed benefits of genetically engineered `` golden rice , '' it has never entered production . According to Jonathan Latham of Independent Science News , the science media has utterly failed to report accurately on genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) -- on their failures and criticisms rather than just their potential successes . A transgenic high-protein cassava , a type of starchy edible root , was lauded in the scientific press but fizzled not long after . So did a supposedly virus-resistant sweet potato that was widely hailed in the media . According to Jonathan Latham of Independent Science News , these and others are just a few examples of what they say is the utter failure of the science media to report accurately and critically on genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) -- on their failures rather than just their touted successes .
In an article entitled `` Fakethrough ! GMOs and the Capitulation of Science Journalism , '' Latham describes how GMOs lauded in the media as `` breakthroughs '' are often just PR boosts for genetically engineered varieties or traits that either are n't new , are untested , or fail ( and the failures are too often not reported ) . Often , GMO reporting also ignores or downplays extensive criticism and concerns raised by independent scientists .
PR 's Baby : Golden Rice
A Google search for `` golden rice , '' which is being genetically engineered to produce beta-carotene in its endosperm , and `` vitamin A '' ( to which beta-carotene is a precursor ) yields over 100,000 results , as of January 7 . It 's been on the cover of Time magazine and in the New York Times many times . Clearly , PR has created a `` buzz '' around the product .
Foodwatch , a consumer advocacy group based in Germany , published a 2012 report , `` Golden Lies : The Seed Industry 's Questionable Gold Rice Project . '' It concludes that managers of the `` golden rice '' project have `` employed propagandistic methods to push the project beyond the issue of vitamin A deficiency , setting a precedent to increase the pressure on regula­tory authorities and accelerate [ d ] the introduction of agricultural biotechnology . It is still not possible to judge whether or not Golden Rice is even technically able to combat vitamin A deficiency . ... Any risks posed by the cultivation or consumption of Golden Rice have been largely ignored . ''
Yet the science media has rushed to promote the rice despite the paucity of evidence for its benefits , Independent Science News writes : `` There is thus what must surely be an unprecedented disparity between the number of articles generated around golden rice and its actual achievement , which currently stands at zero . ''
Scientist Absconds with Notes on GMO Cassava
The Monsanto-funded Donald Danforth Center developed a GMO cassava ( also called manioc or tapioca ) that was announced in a 2011 article in New Scientist by lead author Mohammad Abhary and enthusiastically lauded in other media . But according to Latham , `` a subsequent investigation at the Danforth Center found that the 'modified ' cassava plants in their greenhouses had no zeolin gene in them . They were not transgenic despite the fact that illustrations in the Abhary publication appeared to show they were . '' Abhary had apparently left the country `` along with vital information '' -- like how the plants were produced . New Scientist retracted the study and the lab did not redo it . However , the whole post-enthusiasm debacle was apparently left unreported by major science media .
The Vanishing Virus-Resistant Sweet Potato
Forbes magazine reported in 2002 on the development of a GE virus-resistant sweet potato whose yields it called `` astonishing . '' As documented by Latham , the Toronto Globe and Mail and Canada 's National Post also reported on the GMO root vegetable , the latter even echoing project leader Florence Wambugu 's hyperbolic claim that the technology would pull `` the African continent out of decades of economic and social despair . ''
But on the ground in Kenya , Independent Science News points out that `` Monsanto 's virus resistance was ineffective in field tests and an official report even claimed that 'non-transgenic crops used as controls yielded much more per tuber compared to the transgenics , ' '' and one scientist even remarked that `` all lines tested were susceptible to viral attacks . ''
However , the press , including the New York Times , continued to publish reports and op-eds even in 2010 listing `` virus-resistant sweet potatoes '' as among `` a few examples of genetically engineered foods that could improve the lives of the poor around the globe . ''
`` Missing Context '' in Science Journalism
Latham gives these and other examples of what their report calls the `` capitulation of science journalism '' regarding GMOs . Critically , they note :
Science journalism could at any point over the lifetime of biotechnology have asked some foundational public interest questions : Is the technology ready ? Are the regulators competent ? Why is it considered appropriate for industry to fund and conduct its own safety studies ? What are the views of dissenting scientists ? And many others . Yet only a tiny handful of professional science journalists have ever escaped the standard narrow framing around a specific product , which therefore leaves the reader imagining there are good answers to these questions . ... For example , when the UN published a major report by hundreds of scientists proposing that industrial agriculture and GMOs were inappropriate solutions for agriculture and poverty , the New York Times never once mentioned it .
A population without a dependable media to inform it about the issues with genetic engineering or to provide it with what Latham calls `` missing context '' can not be blamed for asking that they at least be informed by food manufacturers when their products include GMO ingredients .
Most people favor GMO labeling and think they have a basic `` right to know , '' despite the hard-fought losses advocates experienced in the 2013 and 2012 election seasons after GMO corporations flooded the airwaves with disinformation ads . This month , the state of Maine became the second state to pass a law mandating GMO labels ( Connecticut was the first last year ) , and similar bills are pending in both New Hampshire and Vermont .

Here at Ars , we spend about how developers deal with the trade-offs between resolution , frame rate , graphical detail , and simulation complexity they face at the top end of modern console and PC hardware . Quite often , the first-blush `` wow factor '' of more pixels and higher frame rates wins out in this constant balancing act . For Destiny 2 , though , Executive Producer Mark Noseworthy says the team prioritized the complexity of the game itself over hitting a frame rate higher than 30fps .
In a Twitter thread back in June , Noseworthy said that the CPU limits on current consoles mean the game had to scale back to 30fps `` to deliver D2 's AI counts , environment sizes , and # of players . '' In the latest issue of Edge magazine ( excerpted by WCCFTech ) , Noseworthy expands on the reasoning behind that choice :
It 's about the simulation of the Destiny world . Thirty AI at once , large open spaces , six players , sometimes with vehicles , and drop-ships coming in ; that 's where we 're using the CPU . Could we make a Destiny game that ran at 60fps ? Yes , but the space would be smaller , it would be less cooperative , and there 'd be fewer monsters to shoot . That 's not the game we want to make . First and foremost , we 're trying to make an incredible action game . We do n't feel we 've been held back by the choices we 've made about world simulation versus frame rate ; in fact , we think we 're offering a player experience you ca n't have elsewhere because of the choices we 're making .
Put like that , the trade-off does n't sound like a bad one . Yes , a game that 's locked to 30fps looks markedly worse than one running at 60fps or more , all things being equal . The resulting lack of smoothness is especially noticeable in a reflex-based shooting game like Destiny 2 ( though the server 's internal tick rate has arguably more impact on how the game feels ) . That said , a smoother Destiny 2 with fewer simultaneous enemies and fewer player characters in smaller battle locales would probably be noticeably worse to play , too . As long as the game can run steadily at a playable 30 frames per second , without dips , that sounds like a perfectly acceptable trade .
Of course , it 's not a trade that every Destiny 2 player will be forced to make . As Noseworthy notes in the interview , `` if frame rate is something that 's really important to you , there is a platform now where you can spend as much money as you want to go as fast as you want . '' That platform of course , is the PC , where we were duly impressed by a 4K , 60fps version of the game at a preview event back in May . If you want the best graphical fidelity and frame rate for your alien shooting , that might be worth the 46-day wait and deadened recoil that will also face PC players .
Abstract
I deal with JSON deserialization in Swift in a moderately elegant way , without polluting codebase with introducing new operators and initializers .
Context
This is a short , written hastily on a train , post on a topic that many have written about . I wrote it in response to Radek Pietruszewski 's article “ Rethinking JSON in Swift ” . I encourage you to read Radek 's post for more introduction .
Protocol
In my checkers game I use JSON to save and load game state . I use SwiftyJSON to deal with JSON parsing . On “ my side ” I implement JSONConvertible protocol :
protocol JSONConvertible { func toJSON ( ) - > JSON static func fromJSON ( json : JSON ) - > Self ? }
Swift 1.1
In the old days of Swift 1.1 , to implement the protocol , I was using unwrapped — an equivalent of Radek 's ensure :
struct Piece { let id : Int let player : Player let isCaptured : Bool let isKing : Bool } extension Piece : JSONConvertible { func toJSON ( ) - > JSON { return JSON ( [ `` id '' : id , `` player '' : player.toJSON ( ) .stringValue , `` isCaptured '' : isCaptured , `` isKing '' : isKing , ] ) } static func fromJSON ( json : JSON ) - > Piece ? { return unwrapped ( json [ `` id '' ] .int , Player.fromJSON ( json [ `` player '' ] ) , json [ `` isCaptured '' ] .bool , json [ `` isKing '' ] .bool ) .map { ( id , player , isCaptured , isKing ) in // newlines added to fit in // my narrow blog layout Piece ( id : id , player : player , isCaptured : captured , isKing : king ) } } }
Swift 1.2
In Swift 1.2 I just use if let with multiple optionals :
static func fromJSON ( json : JSON ) - > Piece ? { if let id = json [ `` id '' ] .int , player = Player.fromJSON ( json [ `` player '' ] ) , isCaptured = json [ `` isCaptured '' ] .bool , isKing = json [ `` isKing '' ] .bool { return Piece ( id : id , player : player , isCaptured : isCaptured , isKing : isKing ) } else { return nil } }
Advantages
I like this approach because it does n't involve any new operators while still being readable — there 's not enough noise to justify removing it at the cost of introducing new operators .
What I do n't like is the fact that I had to type id , player , isCaptured , and isKing three times there , but if I were to implement a new initializer , I would have to type them this many times anyway .
Limitations
Because fromJSON returns Self ? , it can be implemented “ only ” by structs and final classes . Using JSONConvertible with regular classes results in 'MyClass ' is not convertible to 'Self ? ' error as the compiler ca n't be sure that subclasses override fromJSON ( your class can be in a framework and then its subclasses are not known at compile time ) .
For more discussion of this limitation , see Rob Napier 's answer to a question about returning Self .
Update · 2015-03-02
ElvishJerricco pointed out on Reddit that the final class limitation mentioned above can be worked around by using a required initializer that accepts JSON and returning it from fromJSON . Unfortunately , such initializer ca n't be defined in an extension , which destroys the elegance of the solution for me :
class MyClass { / * ... * / required init ? ( json : JSON ) { / * ... * / } } extension MyClass : JSONConvertible { func toJSON ( ) - > JSON { / * ... * / } static func fromJSON ( json : JSON ) - > Self ? { return self ( json : json ) } }
I do n't have a good answer here , but if one has to use non-final classes and add code to main class definitions , maybe a better solution is to get rid of fromJSON altogether ?
protocol JSONConvertible { init ? ( json : JSON ) func toJSON ( ) - > JSON }

New Google Tool Suggests Competitive Keywords Based on Site Content
Ever wonder what Google thinks the most competitive keywords for your website are based on your content and other SEO elements ? There are helpful third-party tools , such as SEO Moz 's , that spider your content and make recommendations for what a page is about and what terms should be targeted . However , these are still limited in scope and still do n't give you insight into what Google actually thinks .
Google Ads has now ended much of the guesswork by allowing Google Ads users to run a report on your site that tells you possible terms to target with a Pay Per Click campaign . This new tool is very valuable to many different marketers , ranging from people running their first Google Ads campaign looking for good terms to experienced advertisers trying to devise new keywords to target .
In order to use the tool , login or create a new Google Account , if you do n't currently have one . Once logged in , visit the Google Search Based Keyword Tool at www.google.com/sktool/ , there will be an option to run a test on one of the sites associated with your account or to enter a new domain . Google will then give you a list of the most valuable terms it associates with your site , based on the terms ' density in your content and their total number of monthly global searches .
For our site , the tool does a fairly good job . It lists Online Content Management , Raleigh North Carolina Web Design , Web landing page , Web Design Carolina , and Great Web Design as five of the top keywords that it would be worth us running an Google Ads campaign to target . Next to each term , the tool also displays number of monthly searches , suggested CPC bid , and the main page on your site that the phrase was chosen from .
All terms chosen by the Keyword Tool are consistent with our business , and while we are n't curretly running a Pay Per Click campaign for ourselves , we do target many of these terms through Inbound Marketing , SEO , and other techniques .
While certainly , the best longterm approach to Google is focusing achieving high organic rankings vs. paid ads , there are definitely situations where it makes sense to buy ads online and Google has now removed some of the guesswork to building a successful campaign . If you 're currently running an online ad campaign or exploring the possibility of launching one , I recommend checking out this helpful new tool .
The US government is finally examining a regulatory loophole that has allowed companies like Theranos to market diagnostic tests to patients without going through the US Federal Drug Administration first . FDA officials pointed out today in a hearing that these tests endanger patient safety — and that bad tests can require costly clean-up .
The Energy and Commerce 's Subcommittee on Health held a hearing in Washington today to discuss a controversial category of diagnostic tests called `` lab developed tests '' or LDTs . This category is basically a huge loophole that has been around for about 30 years ( longer if you consider that regulation was n't enforced before the loophole was coded into law in 1988 ) ; it gives companies that develop and conduct a diagnostic test in a single lab the ability to avoid submitting their tests to the FDA before using them on patients . The LDT category exists because research hospitals often need to modify commercial tests to suit patient needs . And because academic researchers tend to publish their results anyway , this form of regulation has n't raised too many eyebrows .
Some tests may have caused women to abort a normal pregnancy
But over the past several years , a number of startups have figured out that the loophole could benefit them as well ; they , too , could make tests that diagnose serious medical conditions without having to demonstrate the tests ' validity to the FDA first . And , unlike academics , many of these companies have n't published their results out in the open — which makes it very hard for anyone to figure out if this diagnostics actually work . As a result , some tests may have caused pregnant women to abort a healthy fetus , or to seek the wrong breast cancer treatment . So , today 's hearing was designed to hear arguments for and against a change proposed by the FDA last year that would require that developers of certain LDTs obtain approval before they start to market their tests to patients . Developers would also have to monitor customer complaints after they put out their tests .
The FDA wants to make sure that these tests `` are accurate , reliable and that they do , in fact , identify a disease , '' said Jeffrey Shuren , director of the FDA 's Center for Devices and Radiological Health , during the hearing . Right now , this form of verification is n't conducted by FDA or federal lab inspectors . And that 's a problem , Shuren told the subcommittee . If diagnostic tests return inaccurate results , `` physicians can make the wrong decisions and patients can get hurt . ''
In fact , the FDA yesterday released a report that discusses 20 LDTs that caused harm to patients , Shuren said . Among them was a genetic breast cancer test that gave out inaccurate results in 20 percent of cases . That means that some breast cancer patients may not have received the right treatment . The FDA also mentions prenatal tests that were based on `` disproven scientific concepts . '' These could have caused women to abort a normal pregnancy or to deliver a child with an undiagnosed genetic syndrome .
`` Why in the world would a lab develop a test that was n't safe and accurate ? ''
Many representatives were receptive to Shuren 's arguments . But the examples in the FDA 's report were n't enough to convince Congressman Marsha Blackburn ( R-TN ) and Congressman Michael Burgess ( R-TX ) , who is also a physician . Both went after the FDA 's report for what they said was a small number of case studies . `` It took you three years to provide us with 20 [ examples ] ! '' Burgess told Shuren . Congressman Joe Barton ( R-TX ) , perhaps unfamiliar with capitalism 's incentive system , raised similar objections . `` Why in the world would a lab develop a test that was n't safe and accurate ? '' they said . `` My office is n't being overrun by calls from doctors and patients saying that there are some terrible LDTs out in the marketplace . ''
That may be because their constituents do n't know that some tests ordered by their doctors are wholly unverified . In the case of Pathway Genomics , a startup that began selling a cancer blood test in September , the company had n't conducted the type of study that would have shown that a positive result really did lead to the development of a disease . The company 's CEO , Jim Plante , did n't think that was a problem , however . It was n't until the FDA sent the company a letter calling the test potentially harmful that it stopped letting patients apply for the test online . Physicians can still order the $ 699 test through Pathway 's website .
Theranos failed to document quality audits
And more recently , the blood testing startup Theranos has come under fire following a Wall Street Journal Investigation that questioned testing practices in Theranos ' labs . This was supported by an FDA inspection this past August , which slammed Theranos for failing to document quality audits . That was n't the end of Theranos ' sloppiness , according to the report . It also faulted Theranos for selling an unregulated medical device — the `` Nanotainer '' — which is meant to contain blood from a fingerstick draw . This inspection occurred only because Theranos voluntarily submitted its tests to the FDA .
Shuren countered points raised by these Republican subcommittee members by explaining that the US currently has no reporting system on LDTs . `` We are not monitoring for problems , '' they said , which makes it hard to identify inaccurate tests . That 's exactly the kind issue that the FDA 's proposal would address . The FDA 's report shows that developers are , in fact , selling faulty tests , and results are being used to make medical decisions .
And some LDT developers are n't doing the kinds of studies that would show that their tests work , Shuren explained . ( Pathway Genomics is one such company . ) `` Regardless of whether we regulate them or not , a lab should n't put any test on the market that they do n't have the data to validate , '' they said . The FDA 's new proposal would change that by requiring that companies validate their tests before they hit the market .
`` We are not monitoring for problems . ''
Patient safety is n't the only incentive , however . The cost of regulating LDTs before they hit the market would be smaller than the current cost of helping patients recover after they receive a faulty test result , Shuren said . For example , the FDA estimates that the public health cost associated with a single faulty test — a test named `` CARE Clinical Autism Biomarkers Test '' that led to the incorrect treatment of children — was $ 66.1 million .
The FDA plans to release the finalized guidance for the regulation of LDTs sometime in 2016 . You can watch the hearing in full , here .

Mojang has released a new update for the PC version of its popular sandbox game Minecraft that fixes some `` reported security issues '' and makes various other bug fixes , among other things .
The developer writes on its website that , although you do n't need to , it is highly recommended that you download 1.8.5 `` as soon as possible . ''
The top fixes , courtesy of Mojang , are listed below .
[ Bug MC-79632 ] – Phantom Custom Player in Scoreboard / UUIDs of non-player entities on scoreboards truncated after relog
[ Bug MC-75630 ] – Exploit with signs and command blocks
[ Bug MC-80478 ] – Better server validation for movement packets
[ Bug MC-80479 ] – Invalid beacon effects are not validated
[ Bug MC-80480 ] – Certain attribute values are not bound
Players who encounter Minecraft bugs are encouraged to report their findings through the official Minecraft issue tracker .
Today 's Minecraft update follows another security-themed update , 1.8.4. , which was released last month . That update addressed a user-discovered vulnerability that allowed anyone -- quite easily -- to crash a server hosting Minecraft .
Microsoft acquired Mojang and the Minecraft series last year in a blockbuster deal worth an estimated $ 2.5 billion . Creator Markus `` Notch '' Persson -- a newly minted billionaire as a result of the deal -- has since bought the most expensive home in Beverly Hills and partied with Selena Gomez and Zedd .
Every coach — every parent , teacher , and boss — has a decision to make : How much guidance is the right amount ?
Some parents watch their kids closely . Others let them roam . Some teachers lecture , others prefer the Socratic method . And some coaches create detailed instructions for the players , while others — United States coach Jurgen Klinsmann , for instance — do n't give much at all . It 's all in the same mindset : Get the best outcome possible . What 's the right amount of help to achieve maximum performance ?
Even with those varied approaches in mind , we 've all demonstrated our desire to see Klinsmann do more from the sideline . We 've had smart people discuss Klinsmann 's lack of a tactical acumen . At the same time , we 've had them as coach ( and technical director ) for five years now . We know how they think a team should be run , and it has next to nothing to do with tactics .
Article continues below ...
As Raphael Honigstein explains in their book , Das Reboot , `` Football , [ Klinsmann ] believes , remains a ‘ player-driven game . ' Americans sometimes find that hard to understand , [ Klinsmann ] says , because most team sports are considered coaching-driven there . ‘ You 'll often see players look to the coach for direction . But football does n't work like that , because it 's too fluid . You need players to take charge . ' ''
We 've gotten mad and called them stupid . Klinsmann does not care . They think we 're barking up the wrong tree . We say they should have better tactics ; they say we should learn more about soccer . You think tactics are the way to win a game , Klinsmann does n't . You 're right that it 's kind of annoying that U.S. Soccer chased this guy for years and gave them a big contract and they turn out to set up the team like a playground crew . C'est la vie .
Klinsmann , rather than all these tactics mumbo jumbo , wants their players to take charge . The players are on the field , so the players solve the problems . No restrictions from the sidelines to hold them back . They want to give them the freedom to step up . Go show the world what you 're made of . Go express yourself .
Klinsmann does n't obsess over how players pass or where they press . They do n't harp on the lanes to cover or the angles to destruct . They do n't , it seems , tell their players much about what to do on the field at all . They appear to say a lot about off-the-field things — where to play , how to prepare — but not so much on it . Some coaches dictate a lot of the actions on the pitch , but Klinsmann does n't . It 's a bit retro in a time when most coaches today show up in their fresh skinny jeans ready to dictate every movement on the field , but it is n't inherently wrong .
There are a lot of questions that need answers during the game , but it does n't matter if the answers comes from the coach or the players , just as long as the issues get resolved . It all makes sense , in a way . It 's a `` teach a man how to fish '' kind of thing .
Every coach takes a different place on that spectrum . Every coach handles their players and the team 's approach in a distinct manner . Michael Cox recently described the contrast between Arsene Wenger and Louis van Gaal as `` guided discovery '' vs. `` strict discipline . '' Both men are wildly successful even with those divergent methods . There 's no definitive point that works every time .
When Klinsmann took the job , we thought he 'd outline for us how to play out of the back and combine in the final third , but they do n't teach that way . They challenge and inspires . They give you whimsical metaphors about playing out of the back , hoping it seeps into your heart and soul . The team might yet learn how to play on the front foot , but only because they nudge them gently in the right direction .
There 's a question worth asking at this point : Is there a minimum amount of guidance — of coaching — required to be sufficient ? Line of confrontation , pressure ? Passing style or set pieces ? It 's okay to give players the freedom to make decisions , but are you leaving them helpless if you do n't give them a starting point , some baseline to bind them together ?
When Klinsmann was at their best , with Germany at the 2006 FIFA World Cup , they had Joachim Low to balance out their approach . Low handled all of the tactical and structural details . A head coach has a lot of their plate — man management being the first and most important duty . It 's fine for the assistant to take over the actual instruction . Klinsmann gave their romantic lectures of revolution and adaption and attacking , then Low went out and actually implemented it . Now Klinsmann is riding solo and needs to sort out the balance on their own .
It does n't take much to realize that the balance of instruction is wrong right now . Maybe it is because Low is coaching Germany instead of assisting Klinsmann , maybe it 's the U.S. players . Either way , Klinsmann 's style and their place on the spectrum of guidance is n't producing results at the moment . It 's not about whether Klinsmann is a good coach or not . It 's about what they can do to improve the team right now .
Klinsmann has a lot of good qualities . I like their bullheaded belief in what they think is right . I envy leaders that do n't question their own decisions . One of those abilities , though , does n't appear to be able to figure out this proper balance of instruction as a coach . There 's a time to have strength in conviction and there 's a time to grow . They would n't be the first coach or parent or teacher to get it wrong .
To riot or not to riot is n't the question . Klinsmann will keep their job . And this is our national team and I ca n't think of many things worse than cheering against guys fighting for your country 's colors . Rather , we should hope — demand — that Klinsmann either hires an assistant who can create the balance or adapt himself .
How much guidance is the right amount ? I do n't have the right answer , nor is there a right answer . But whatever Klinsmann is doing right now is n't working . Hopefully they figure it out before either they or American soccer pays the price .

Ferguson protesters and football fans fought in the street after the St. Louis Rams game against the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday afternoon , the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported .
The protesters were outside the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis yelling and chanting about the killing of Michael Brown , the black 18-year-old who was fatally shot by a white police officer from Ferguson , Missouri , in August .
{ snip }
There was a spitting incident caught on video–but this one involved a female protester spitting in a man 's face .
The black female was heard on the video yelling a string of racially charged expletives at police and fans .
“ F * * * all you white motherf * * * ers ! ” they were heard yelling at one point .
A white man was seen arguing with the woman as they stood almost toe-to-toe at one point .
They then backed out of frame–but the sound of spitting was heard and a visible clump of spit came at the man 's face .
{ snip }
The female was then surrounded by several police officers who placed them in handcuffs .
{ snip }
Police reported that two women , one of whom was a juvenile , were arrested after the street fight , the Post-Dispatch reported .
More from the Post-Dispatch concerning the brawl :
At one point during the scuffle , a protester carrying an upside-down American flag used the pole as a weapon , attempting to jab a fan with the pole . A short time later , after the initial confrontation , a different fan grabbed the flag and ran with it for a brief period ; protesters then wrestled the flag back . Two people were injured including one woman who was punched in the face after chanting “ Let 's go Rams ” to protesters . They were later treated and released by paramedics . Police did not provide details on the second victim 's injuries . Police said two groups of about 20 to 25 people each had argued and fought .

Building on the already excellent initial lineup announcement the Nashville-based Americana Music Association has released the full roster of artists performing during the event .
Some of the additions that stand out to me are roots-rockers Shooter Jennings and Austin Lucas , alt.country stalwarts Bottle Rockets and Ashley Monroe who apparently has no problem working both the Americana and Music Row sides of the fence ( good ! ) One performer I 'm bummed to see missing from the roster is Jason Isbell ( Though their talented better half , Amanda Shires , is on the list . ) There might be scheduling conflicts with their current tour supporting the excellent “ Southeastern . ”
The vagueness of Americana 's boundaries allows a richness and diversity within a shared source and vision . it 's what legend , and scheduled performer , Darrell Scott describes positively as a “ hard-to-define place . ”
the selections show a broad range of diversity and excellence the of the genre . Great to see many Casa Twang favorites represented as well .
The AMA has created a Spotify playlist of the performers on the 2013 bill .
The 14th annual event will take place in Nashville , Sept. 18-22 . I 'll be there . hope you are too !

PITTSBURGH , PA - NOVEMBER 13 : Head coach Jason Garrett of the Dallas Cowboys leads their team out onto the field before the game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field on November 13 , 2016 in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . ( Photo by Justin K. Aller/Getty Images )
After being one of the most dominate positional groups in the NFL for years , it appears the Dallas Cowboys offensive line could take a step back in 2017 .
We 've all heard the phrase : “ A chain is only as strong as its weakest link ” . The same literal wisdom could be applied when talking about the Dallas Cowboys offensive line this season .
Despite featuring three perennial Pro Bowlers in left tackle Tyron Smith , center Travis Frederick and right guard Zack Martin , it 's the play of the other two positions that could sink what has been the most feared positional groups in the NFL for several seasons .
Over the offseason , the Cowboys offensive line lost two starters . Those players being right tackle Doug Free to retirement and left guard Ronald Leary to free agency .
Third-year lineman La'el Collins , who is coming off a season-ending toe injury , is expected to make the move from guard to right tackle , replacing Free . Many view this shift to actually be an upgrade . But so far , Collins continues to struggle with consistency as they try to make the transition to a position they have n't played since their time at LSU .
“ Collins has been having problems with their hand placement and Monday was no different , ” wrote football analyst Bryan Broaddus on the team 's official website . “ There just does n't appear to be any real consistency with Collins and their hands . Some practices they hold them high and then the next , they 're low around their thigh pads , which takes them time to get them into position . They just does n't look comfortable right now and it affects the way they block . ”
Collins has the rest of training camp and four preseason games to get it right . At least the Cowboys have set them at the right tackle position and will allow them to remain there to focus on improving . The same can not be said for left guard .
The battle for the starting left guard position in Dallas initially appeared to be between two men : former third round draft pick Chaz Green and first round bust Jonathan Cooper . But a shoulder injury , one of many injuries that have plagued them their entire career , appears to have dropped Green from the running as he 's now considered week-to-week .
And according to Broaddus , Cowboys fans might see Byron Bell starting at left guard this Saturday against the L.A. Rams as Dallas ' coaching staff is still unsure who will play the position come Week One . That should tell you what you need to know about Cooper 's play the past few weeks .
GET DRAFT HELP : Fantasy Pros Draft Wizard and Fantasy Football Tools
Playing next to three All-Pros , many have cast off any worries about the play of the Dallas Cowboys offensive line this season . They figure some combination of Tyron Smith , Zack Martin and Travis Frederick will “ pick up the slack ” for the inconsistent play of the other two starters .
But the truth is , savvy defensive coordinators will attack those weak links . And at some point , these non-Pro Bowlers will be asked to hold their own . With La'el Collins struggling at their new position and no one inked on the depth chart at the other yet , I think the offensive line concerns in Dallas are valid and certainly worth watching closely in the coming weeks .

Despite a horrendous season for the Montreal Canadiens , Alex Galchenyuk has been a rare bright spot.The forward has 19 goals and 20 assists in 64 games , just two goals and seven points shy of their career-high in both those categories . Lately , head coach Michel Therrien has put the natural centre on the wing with Lars Eller , and this move has paid huge dividends . Is Galchenyuk on wing meant to be ?
Alex Galchenyuk on Wing : Meant To Be ?
Galchenyuk played centre for most of their hockey career leading up to the NHL , but has largely played left wing during their four seasons with the Montreal Canadiens . At 6 ' 1″ , 207 LBS , the American was the ideal centre the Canadiens needed when they selected them third overall at the 2012 NHL Draft .
After playing on an irregular basis at centre in the past two seasons , Galchenyuk played the first half of the season at their natural position , producing 10 goals and 17 assists in 44 games . Once the team started going through their slump , they were put back on the wing . They never got the opportunity to centre captain Max Pacioretty and workhorse Brendan Gallagher on the top line .
They did play a handful of games on the wing with Gallagher and Tomas Plekanec , and the trio did play well together , producing more consistently than the top line of Pacioretty , David Desharnais and former-Hab Dale Weise . However , after Desharnais went down with a foot injury on February 15 , Galchenyuk was told to play on the wing with Lars Eller , whom they centred earlier the season .
The duo , whomever they were put with , have been scoring at a better rate than any other line . Galchenyuk has five goals in the last five games , and eight points in the last eleven games . All season , their points per sixty minutes is 2.28 , second on the team behind Gallagher , but they play only an average of 15:45 per game .
Eller , who has 1.37 P/60 , has a goal and three assists in the past five contests , and six points in the last 11 , which are good numbers for a shutdown centre . However It 's probably not good enough for someone expected to play on the top two lines .
Both players have good possession numbers , too . Galchenyuk , second on the team with an astonishing Corsi of 59.45 % in all situations , has a PDO of 98.35 , so more pointss are yet to come from the 22-year-old . Surprisingly , Eller is fourth in Corsi for 5-on-5 situations with 54.29 % . With possession like that , the two players can be a wrecking force on both sides of the ice .
Galchenyuk was put on the wing in mid-January , and although their Corsi % did drop by 2.7 points , their goals per sixty has significantly increased from 0.9 to 1.5 goals . Their shooting percentage is also up 1.9 % from 11 % in 21 games that they have played on the wing . Most significant for the young sniper is that they are seeing 17.4 minutes per game on the wing , compared to 15 minutes a night at centre .
The numbers partially argue why Galchenyuk is better suited to play with Eller , and on the wing . They compliment each other as Eller is a defensive centre , much like Plekanec , and is responsible in their own zone . Galchenyuk is attack minded , creates open space in the offensive zone , and can virtually score from anywhere . Their new favourite scoring spot is from the right face-off circle , preferably down low . They have an amazing shot from there , and as a center , they would not be able to roam in that territory of the ice .
As per war-on-ice.com , Galchenyuk has higher shooting percentages in the slot and on the sides of the net , and their highest-percentage shot is in the right slot . Although they have scored many goals from the right side , they take a fair amount of shots from the left side , too . They take more shots from higher up in the zone on the left wing .
Here are still screenshots of two goals from each side .
Goal vs. Toronto on February 27 . Notice how Galchenyuk is on right side , and after circling the puck , right winger Sven Andrighetto loops back towards the left side , and goes towards the slot . Eller , meanwhile , is crashing the net and screening Jonathan Bernier while Galchenyuk walks in to score .
In this goal against Buffalo on February 2nd , Galchenyuk picks up the puck off the face-off , cuts in from the left side , and scores one of their nicest goals this season . Notice again that Galchenyuk is supported by a man in front and a man in the slot .
In order for Galchenyuk to be successful on the wing , they will need to play in this type of system in the offensive zone . This will allow them to move freely from the left and right sides , have a passing option , and have a player screening the goalie should they decide to shoot .
Gallagher is their perfect line mate for this , and of course , at this point an ideal centre may not be on the roster . Gallagher 's office is in front of the net , as seen in the goal against Buffalo . Eller could stay in the slot and feed Galchenyuk the occasional pass to set them up for a goal , as the duo have been doing lately . Gallagher was put on a line with them at the end of Thursday night 's contest against the Kings , so one could presume that Therrien is experimenting with them as a trio .
While Eller and Galchenyuk have done well , it would be interesting to see if Galchenyuk could do even more with a more offensively inclined player in the middle . Of course it is up to Marc Bergevin to acquire that player in the offseason , and until that happens , Eller is the player best suited to play the middle of their line on the current roster .
Galchenyuk has a high ceiling offensively . They will need a miraculous finish to the season to hit the 30-goal plateau , but for now 25 is very much in reach . They could even go beyond in future years .
Despite the protests of many Habs fans , it would appear Alex Galchenyuk is suited to terrorizing goalies on the wing- and not at centre- where they can freely be an offensive force .

When Dwight Howard was 23 , they looked to many like the future of the NBA . They had just carried the Magic to the NBA Finals , upsetting a 66-win Cleveland Cavaliers team in the process . They were the only All-Star on Orlando 's roster ; as the team 's offensive and defensive centerpiece , they averaged 20 points and 15 rebounds a game in the playoffs . Needless to say , not too much has gone right for Howard since , and six drama-filled years later , they have inexplicably become somewhat of a forgotten man .
The story of “ Superman 's ” demise is well known . After their run to the Finals in 2008-'09 , the Magic never reached those heights again and Howard eventually demanded a trade , forcing their way out in a protracted year-long process that destroyed their reputation . Adding insult to injury , they concurrently suffered a major back injury — which required surgery in the spring of 2012 — that temporarily robbed them of their athleticism and turned them into a shell of himself .
Howard 's defensive presence helps cover for young and/or indifferent defenders at other positions in Houston . ( AP )
The list of knocks on Howard is a mile long . At various points in the last few years , they have been widely criticized for their indecisiveness , immaturity and selfishness . In the five seasons since they made the NBA Finals , their free throw shooting has never improved , their post moves still do n't look very natural and they still act like an overgrown kid when they are on the court . And , while they have made in incremental improvements to their game over the years , those have been obscured by injuries and a failure to meet expectations . To wit : Howard has played on three different teams over the last three seasons , but has n't gotten out of the first round of the playoffs since the 2009-'10 campaign .
Given all that has transpired — for Dwight in general and for Houston this summer — there is n't that much enthusiasm surrounding the Rockets as they come into this season . They won 54 games with Howard and James Harden playing alongside one another for the first time , but that solid regular-season performance was overshadowed by a six-game loss to the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs . After losing Chandler Parsons , Jeremy Lin and Omer Asik in free agency — while striking out in their critical pursuit of Chris Bosh —some actually have the Rockets finishing out of the playoffs entirely .
Good Luck . It is sort of like showing up to a nuclear war with a squirt gun .
The following is a write-up posted by an Office of Special Affairs ( dirty tricks and propaganda arm of Scientology Inc. ) operative on how to counter free speech on the internet . It is posted currently with specific reference to those commenting on the break up of Tom Cruise and Katies Holmes and Scientology Inc 's role in the affair . The recipient Ray McKay is a well-known OSA operative . “ Razzline members ” refers to members of a corporate Scientologist online collective . When will David Miscavige ( supreme leader of corporate Scientology and Tom Cruise 's best man ) ever learn that attempts to suppress communication and expression only make more news than the news they attempt to censor ?

Subject : RE : Simple hatting on how to fight back on the internet
and Stand Up For Your Religion
Dear Razz Line members ,
I am not a big fan of media , but you may have glanced the news of
the split between TC and Holmes and all the speculations around .
While this is a personal matter , when people start to bring our
religion into the middle and a bunch of uninformed people start to
spread false datum , rumors and defame our religion it became a
matter that does affect my Dynamics and I believe that affects
yours as well .
Well , I am not somebody that I am going to simply stand and watch a
bunch of uninformed people putting my religion under the carpet . So
here is a simple hatting on how you can causative fight back and at
the same time stand up and defend our religion on the internet .
Microsoft or Google or any of these big online company require that
each person when create an account with them follow a Code of
Conduct when they are on the internet . If there are abuses of such
Code of Conduct , this website do actually invite you to report the
matter to the Moderator — in other word , write the matter to
Ethics .
This is where things can be turned around !
Here is a simple example on how to fight back abuse of the Code of
Conduct that is happening within the Microsoft ( MSN ) website :
1 . One of the Code of Conduct that Microsoft impose is to not
“ threatens , defames , degrades… an individual or group of
individuals for any reason ; including on the basis of age , gender ,
disability , ethnicity , sexual orientation , race , religion ; or
incites or encourages anyone else to do so .. ”
So is you go to MSN Now – What 's Trending ? you will see different
articles about TC and Holmes split . The articles then ask for
comment… . ( Note : if the article does not show up anymore on the
first page , go to the search bar and type ‘ Tom Cruise Divorce'…
or a similar search . You want to go where the comment section is )
On each comment if you place your mouse over it , it shows up on the
bottom right a tag that say ‘ REPORT ' .
2 . Click the “ Report ” Tag and a small window show up . Click the tab
“ Send Note to Moderator ”
3 . Once you do that a new window show up and you can send a text of
100 character . You can write something like ‘ Violate Your Code of
Conduct ' . “ defames or degrades a group for any reason including on
the basis of religion . ”
The above exact comment it fit .
4 . Read the comment from people and pick the ones that fit the
violation of the Code of Conduct .
5 . Report the Violation ! ! That 's it ! ! You are done .
6 . Now rinse and repeat the same process from step 2 to 5 ..
Once you got the hang of it is gets pretty fast and in one hour you
can report of lots of this nonsense comment !
If is only one person ( me ) reporting these issues , the Moderator at
Microsoft will not take the comment off . if you start to have 10 or
20 people reporting it , they are going to take this down .
LRH give an exact quote on the Price of Freedom that you find on
Tape 1 – Transcript page 32 – The Genus of Dianetics and
Scientology – ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND CONGRESS . The same quote
appear also in the Tech Dictionary under the Price of Freedom .
Ok – there you have it ! ! This simple hatting is something that you
can use now for this or similar situations that may happen in the
future .
Over to you !
Best
Daniel

SEAL THE DEAL ...
OUR STORY : Nicora Johns
The idea for starting the company began with both nostalgia for an old American craft lost and a genuine empathy for all the unemployed American artisans . These folks could be benefiting from having full-time fulfilling work as craftspeople making shoes . ( Including the founder of the company ) . Currently only 1 % of the shoes Americans buy are made in America and this number decreases by 7 % every year . All the while , Americans are still spending billions of dollars annually on shoes . There must be a solution to this conundrum ?
Today , the shoe industry is one of the highest polluting industries in the world . Between the chemicals required to treat leather or make synthetic materials and the agricultural destruction caused by overgrazing livestock , shoe materials make the top ten list of world 's most polluting industries every year .
But what if the US shoe industry were to make a comeback , but we do it more eco-conscious and socially-conscious than everyone else ?
This is the EXACT idea behind our debut collection . Our plan is supported by a network of shoemakers and industry professionals here in the United States , who have helped us prepare our shoe company 's Kickstarter launch . We all have a lot of hope at stake for our project as US shoe industry jobs continue to go abroad .
We are partnered with materials manufacturers that produce all of our eco-conscious , high quality human-made shoe materials . Our partners were chosen because they share in our goals of making production safer for the environment , eliminating waste and creating jobs for Americans .
Because we produce handmade shoes locally and buy from local suppliers , we are able to make custom sizes for little or no extra cost . We can also let our customers choose custom materials and colors .
___________________
The Current State of the Shoe Industry
Since you are reading this , it 's probably safe for us to assume you are a consumer who cares where their shoes come from . So lets get to the honest truth…
Over 80 % of shoe materials production & shoe manufacturing occurs in developing countries that have substandard environmental regulations . It takes 200 plus chemicals to make leather and according to UN statistics 70 % of developing countries dump waste into groundwater and do not control emissions into the atmosphere . This is a recipe for polluted waterways , air pollution , ocean dumping and risks to health and human welfare on a global scale .
With that said , the current state of the worldwide leather industry has rendered it impossible for us to use leather while keeping to our mission of using all US materials & environmentally responsible production . The leather industry is highly dependent on fast-produced factory farmed cattle and heavy chemicals to quickly turn hair covered hides into smooth , supple vibrantly colored leathers . Little attention is paid to the chemical dumping , water or air pollution created from tanning/dying nor to how/where the cattle were grazed ( rainforest land in South America for example ) .
All synthetic materials are not created equal . Synthetics are created with chemicals and when these chemical companies are not in countries with strict environmental regulations , the results can be catastrophic . It 's important to know where the factories were that made the materials and where the chemicals components came from too . This is a burdensome task if you 're just trying to buy a pair of shoes .
It 's time for all of us to learn how to decrease our environmental impact . If we complain loud enough , the shoe industry will listen .

FOXBORO — The Patriots were without Dion Lewis for the postseason last year . Or maybe , we should say , they were missing their X-factor .
Ever since they brought them aboard in 2015 , all that happens when Lewis plays is the Patriots win . They 've never lost with them on the field .
After last night 's 34-16 divisional round win over the Houston Texans , their perfect record remained intact , as the Pats are now 16-0 in games in which Lewis has appeared .
Is it just a coincidence ? Or is there something more to Lewis ' presence in the lineup equaling victories ?
It was certainly hard to argue with their contributions last night , especially in a game the Patriots were n't at their best , particularly on offense . Tom Brady uncharacteristically threw a pair of interceptions , equaling their total on the year , while Lewis fumbled a kickoff to create a third turnover .
Lewis , however , more than made up for their gaffe .
All they did to help the cause , and prevent the unthinkable from happening with a Texans upset , was catch a 13-yard touchdown pass , scoot in from the 1 , and take a kick back 98 yards .
That 's three touchdowns , three different ways , as they checked off the boxes in the receiving , running and return game . The kickoff return was the first in Patriot history .
Lewis is the fifth Patriot to score three touchdowns in a playoff game and he 's the first player from any team in in the Super Bowl era to score on a rush , a catch and a kick return in a playoff game .
“ I 'm just staying ready , doing whatever the coaches ask me to do , ” Lewis said . “ They had a great game plan , great plays , and there was great execution on those plays . ”
Lewis , however , kept kicking themselves over the fumble that set up the Texans touchdown , and drew the visitors within 14-13 in the second quarter .
It spoiled their night . But ultimately , their performance overrode the one fumble . After all , he 's trying to make up for lost time . They are n't sure if he 'd make it back at all from their knee injury and subsequent setback , but they made it , and he 's making defenses pay .
“ He 's played well all season and he 's worked their way back from injury , ” tight end Martellus Bennett said of Lewis , who was playing in their first career playoff game . “ It 's good to see guys like that have success . ”
Lewis tore their ACL in the eighth game last season . The Patriots were on their way to being 8-0 . This year , they came off the physically unable to perform list on Nov. 20 at San Francisco , which is when the Patriots went on a seven-game win streak to end the year . Last night , they made it eight .
“ I 'm on a great team . I got great teammates , a great coach and a great quarterback , ” Lewis said . “ So , it ai n't me . Believe that . ”
At the very least , he 's part of it . They are an X-factor , especially for the offense . Lewis ' addition gives offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels more options and versatility out of the backfield , and in turn , makes it tougher on defenses . Given their ability to run , and also catch the ball , defenses are n't quite sure if it 's a pass or run play when he 's in .
They caught the ball in the left flat and took it 13 yards in for the first score of the game . Then Lewis got a few blocks , but basically showed off their breakaway speed in going the distance , taking the rock 98 yards for a kickoff return .
“ He 's a phenomenal football player and a great asset to our team , ” said Julian Edelman , who also had a big game . “ It 's great to have them out there . ”
Lewis is a difference-maker , something they do n't have in their backfield when he 's not there . They help produce victories .
“ He made some big plays for us , ” said Brady . “ That kickoff return was incredible , that touchdown catch , the run . They did a great job . ”
Not many people have produced a game like that , especially in the postseason .
“ It feels good , but I 'm not thinking about that , ” Lewis said . “ It 's nice we won , that 's the most important thing . I 'm happy we won . Feel bad . I feel like I let my team down a little bit ( with the fumble ) . But I 'm going to enjoy the win . ”
Blackburn Rovers can confirm the loan signing of Chelsea Under-21 captain Todd Kane .
The highly-rated right-back , who has just completed a successful spell with Preston , joins on a one-month youth loan through to February 10th .
Rovers ' caretaker manager Gary Bowyer moved quickly to secure the services of the England Under-19 international after scan results revealed that Adam Henley would spend several weeks on the sidelines with a hamstring injury .
Born in Cambridgeshire , Kane has been with Chelsea since Under-8 level and after rising through the ranks , the tough-tackling defender has starred against Rovers in recent seasons on the big stage .
They scored a spectacular equaliser in the 2011 Premier Reserve League national play-off final , which the Stamford Bridge outfit won 5-4 on penalties , and played an integral role in last season 's FA Youth Cup success , as Chelsea beat Rovers 4-1 on aggregate in the final over two legs .
The 19-year-old , who is yet to play for their parent club , ended the 2011-12 season as part of the first team squad that flew to Munich for the Champions League final and was involved in the celebrations after Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
Kane gained their first taste of senior football during a six-week loan spell with Preston North End , which ended on January 5th . They featured five times for the Lilywhites , making their league debut away to Leyton Orient in late November and playing twice in the FA Cup .
They are available for Rovers ' npower Championship games against Wolves , Charlton Athletic , Brighton , Bristol City and Ipswich , but is cup tied for the fourth round clash away to Derby County .
Kane is Rovers ' second January signing after Josh King 's loan move from Manchester United was made permanent earlier this month .

New York Jets quarterback reported to training camp looking like a combination of the Iron & Wine guy and an athletic Zach Galifianakis . Now he 's just some guy with a shaved head thanks to an unspecified bet .
“ There was a little wager that happened , ” [ Eric ] Decker said . “ I do n't know if I want to be the one to spill the beans . But you 've got to ask them how it came about and why it 's shaved today and not next week. ” Fitzpatrick did n't address the media Wednesday , so the masses must wait for an explanation . Decker did reveal , however , that the lost bet forced Fitzpatrick to shave their head . Trimming was n't an option . “ I 'm just going to say it 's a wager , ” Decker said . “ He lost a bet . They had to pay the price . That 's all I can say . ”
Fitzpatrick kept their trademark beard , of course .
They appear to have fallen victim to a classic gambling foil . Never risk more than you can afford to lose . Fitzpatrick 's lustrous mane was a major distraction keeping the media from focusing on a friction-filled holdout and and subsequent new contract . Any true schemer knows that you keep the masses ' attention on the little stuff so they ca n't notice when you screw up the big stuff .
If Fitzpatrick and the Jets offense sputters , their buddy Brandon Marshall will have to get into another imbroglio with a sports blogger or something to deflect criticism .

Kyle Flood 's first post-season wrapup as Rutgers football coach Monday focused mostly on the future — with recruiting and spring practice the next two major items on their agenda — but also included a rare personal note .
Flood acknowledged for the first time that their mother , Louise , passed away Dec. 28 , the night of the Russell Athletic Bowl , following a lengthy illness .
The Scarlet Knights ended their season with a dreary 13-10 overtime loss to Virginia Tech — a result , Flood said , that was not related to their personal situation .
“ I do n't make any excuses for that and I think there are a lot of players , or a lot of people in our program , who have things going on in their personal lives , ” Flood said , “ and certainly my mother is a very important person in my life and somebody that really is a big reason I am the person that I am today .

“ But for me to use that as an excuse — certainly when the people you love are in pain it 's certainly on your mind , but I also know that the one thing that would have hurt my mother more than anything would be to know that they were keeping me from doing my job . ”
On the football front , Flood touched on a wide range of topics during their 20-minute session with the media :
They made it clear that Gary Nova is entrenched as the starting quarterback despite a poor finish the final six games ( seven TD passes compared to 13 interceptions during that time , with Rutgers ending at 9-4 and on a three-game losing streak ) .
“ One of the things I 'm most excited about this spring is to have somebody coming back who , for the first time in a long time at that position , is going to get the reps that a starter gets , ” Flood said .
They said they would meet with backup Chas Dodd , who played only sparingly this year after serving as a co-starter their first two seasons , about their future . Flood said , however , they are “ not concerned ” about Dodd transfering .
Rutgers has no proven backup quarterback beyond Dodd .
They do n't expect any additional draft-eligible underclassmen to apply for the NFL by the Jan. 15 deadline , after cornerback Logan Ryan and running back Jawan Jamison did so last week .
“ Certainly , anything could happen , ” Flood said . “ But I think for this season those are going to be the two that go and I really do n't anticipate anyone else . ”
No staff changes — for whatever reason — appear imminent .
“ I do n't anticipate any staff changes at this point , ” they said .
With Jamison gone and Savon Huggins the clear starter , they need to establish a pecking order at running back behind Huggins . Paul James , Ben Martin and Desmon Peoples , who redshirted as a first-year student this season , will get a long look in the spring . Incoming recruit Dontea Ayres is also expected to enroll this month , allowing them to participate in spring practice .
“ I think we need to look at all three of them ( beyond Ayres ) and we really need to decide what our depth is going to be at that position , ” they said . “ We 're hoping one of the new players from the signing class will be with us as well for the spring . I think that will help us . ”

'Nike phenomenon ' resurfaces in B.C . with discovery of foot in shoe

If you die in coastal waters and are not discovered and you are wearing a running shoe — especially one with with gas injected into the shoe soles — then one or both of your feet could end up as the newest case of the `` Nike Phenomenon . ''
That 's what happened to someone 's foot Sunday on a Vancouver Island shoreline . The Canadian Press reported that a hiker exploring Botanical Beach near Port Renfrew `` came across a running shoe containing a human foot in a sock . '' The B.C . Coroners Service is investigating but so far foul play is not suspected .
So far , since 2007 , 13 feet have washed ashore in British Columbia . Others have washed ashore elsewhere in the Northwest and across the globe .
For instance , Canada.com reported in 2008 that a right foot in a sock was found in New Zealand , a right foot in a high-top runner in the Ottawa River in Ottawa , two feet on Chesil Beach in southern England , two in Spain , one in California and another in Merseyside in the U.K .
In a story I wrote about the phenomenon in 2011 , Curtis Ebbesmeyer , world renown oceanographer and beachcomber extraordinaire , told me :
`` I think you could probably trace it to the Nike phenomenon . Nike was the one that really brought in the air soles . Certainly in the '90s , Nike was a major producer of shoes with gas injected soles . Once you start doing that then you have at least part of the phenomenon . ''
Coroners have explained that hundreds of people are likely missing in coastal waters and over time their bodies will decompose and disarticulate and what will float . Of the more than a dozen feet found in shoes , non of them have been associated with murder and certainly not mechanical dismemberment .
Of the 12 previous incidents , coroners report that 10 feet have been identified as belonging to seven people .
The is the 13th foot is currently under investigation . Regional Coroner Matt Brown told CKNW radio that DNA tests will be used to try and identify who the foot belongs to .
`` The shoe itself we believe was manufactured in late 2012 early 2013 so what we are looking for most likely is somebody who went missing between March of 2013 and December of 2015 . ''

MANCHESTER-by-the-SEA , Mass . ( AP ) — A Massachusetts man has found a way to profit from the several feet of snow in their yard : He 's shipping it to people in warmer climates for the bargain price of $ 89 for six pounds .
Kyle Waring , of Manchester-by-the-Sea , got the idea while shoveling snow earlier this winter and launched ShipSnowYo.com .
[ NEW ] we ship 10 lbs of boston snow to your friends , families or enemies in the US ! live @ NOON est # bosnow # boston pic.twitter.com/FBQxOjVh4m — ShipSnowYo.com ! ❄️ ( @ shipsnowyo ) February 23 , 2015
At first they shipped 16.9-ounce snow-filled bottles for $ 19.99 , but they found the snow melted by the time it arrived at its destination .
So they came up with a new plan , selling six pounds at a time . They tell Boston.com even if the snow melts a little by the time it arrives , the package can still make 10 to 15 snowballs .
He 's also started offering 10-pound packages for $ 119 .
They say he 'll keep selling until people stop ordering .
I just realized who you are . I just realized that our younger daughters are in the same class together . I just realized that we have muddled through classroom parties and field trips sharing like stories of how we both moved from different states , in the same month , 4 years ago and how we both like comfortable shoes . I wonder at what point you realized who I am ?
I have counted back numerous weeks since your passing smile in the hall turned to icy glares . I talked myself into assuming that you were just having a day , or a week , or a stressful stretch… .
…Maybe stressful like it was for us 3 years ago when our eldest children shared a classroom . It was n't until this year , that my daughter has begun to show signs of their old self . Your son has finally stopped making snide comments in the lunchroom . They have finally stopped seeking them out to blame . They no longer share a classroom .
They no longer comes home every day with a different question… “ Do my eyes really look that bad ? ” “ Do they really look like this ? ” “ Are all Japanese people good at math ? ” “ What is a Chink ? ” “ Are “ doi-ng , doi-ng , dong , ding ” real Chinese words ? ” “ Can I call you my real mom , or are you my step-mom ? ” “ I wish you were my real mom. ” “ Do you think we could find my real mom ? ” “ Can we move back to where we used to live , no one there cared about how I look ? ” “ Can we move to China ? No one there would think I look weird…… ”
There are many more of course…six months ' worth . Every day , I would cry with them Every day , I would attempt to arm them with a coping mechanism… ” tell them to learn their Asian countries , ” “ tell them if they want to speak Chinese , to take a class , ” “ scoff at them like the football player in Napoleon Dynamite , ” “ do n't look at them when they call your name , ” “ ignore him , ” “ ignore them , ” “ ignore him , ” “ ignore them…. ” But honestly in my heart of hearts , I knew all of it was pointless in the face of an 8-year-old peer who had rallied more than half of the boys in the class .
I can only pretend to understand them isolation .
They still have no friends to speak of . Says they do n't need them and that they understand how weird it would be for a blonde girl , whose family is from Europe , to hang around with someone who looks like her… .
At first , I blamed myself . I blamed my naivety . I blamed my husband 's past employer for laying people off . I blamed God . I blamed my real-estate agent for their obligation to be unbiased when telling us about school districts . I blamed ignored paperwork my adoption agency sent out called “ Why to Avoid Living in Small Towns . ”
I had grown up in a small town . We had a handful of kids from different ethnicities . I do not ever remember anyone harassing them about the color of their skin or the shape of their eyes . Ever . I did not even know that racism existed until my father moved to Atlanta when I was 13 . I visited one summer . A boy on the playground called me a “ cracker. ” I laughed at them “ Eeeewww , ” I said “ What am I , a saltine… ? ” My father laughed . They told me what being a “ cracker ” really meant . I was embarrassed . Embarrassed to be white . I could not even fathom how anyone could make fun of another person based on ethnicity , an attribute you never get to choose .
However , I did not blame you . I do not blame you . Even amid icy glares and up-and-down looks , I can not bring myself to blame you . I ponder your side of our story ? Maybe you grew up that way ? Or maybe that is the one thing you would change about your husband ? Or maybe your son had troubles where you lived before and you really wanted a clean slate ? Or maybe you were as shocked as I would be if one of my children treated another person so harshly ? Or maybe….I really do n't know . Or maybe…I really can not even begin to fathom .
That is why I chose to write this . I wonder if you know my truth ? I wonder if you ever ponder my side , my daughter 's side . I wonder if you know that I had contacted teachers , counselors , principles for six months before my eight-year-old daughter stood up in the middle of that class and told them peers they would no longer take it . Six months , before my daughter stopped playing the victim role handed them
I did not just contact the teachers , the counselors , the principles….I pleaded with them…. ” Address the whole school in the Anti-bullying Rally next week ” … . “ We do n't cover racism as bullying. ” … . ” Anonymously address the class , take a no-tolerance stance ” … . “ We feel that this is a non-issue ” … .. “ Talk to the boys , take them aside and say it will not be tolerated ” … . “ She needs to learn to ignore them . ”
“ Alright Darlin ' Ive got an idea , we 'll call it “ Operation No More. ” I 'll pay you $ 20 , a whole $ 20 bill , if the next time one of them starts saying anything mean , you stand up in the middle of class , no matter what is happening , no matters whose class , and say as loud as you can without screaming “ so and so is being racist and I will not tolerate it anymore ! ” Practice…Raaay-cist , Raaay-cist . I will pay you $ 20 each time you do it… ” $ 20 goes along way when you are 8 . It only took once .
Honestly , I felt conflicted that your son ended up getting “ the first write-up I ever got ” as they pointed out to my daughter many times in the lunch line the following year . But you know what , they stopped . They stopped whispering their name and pulling up the sides of their eyes past their eyebrows . They stopped rallying their friends . They stopped telling them to wear their glasses “ ‘ cause that 's what Japanese people do. ” They stopped . For the entire rest of that year .
Honestly , I hope for a truce . I hope we can discuss this someday . I hope we can sit down and talk . Talk about how your son was having a bad year . Or how they had horrible influences at their previous school . Or maybe we could talk about the schools role in it all . How they ignored me for six months . How they like to sweep dirt under rugs . How I was out of options . How my daughter was spiraling into self-pity . And how being a victim was starting to taint them every action .
Still , I refuse to blame you . My kids do things that horrify me regularly . I do not know what events led up to that year of you and your son 's life , so I refuse to judge you . I will instead hope that it was a fluke , a bad moment , the aftermath of a bad year . And I will pray , that it is not at all , how you have taught and are teaching your children to treat anyone , ever .
Sincerely ,
You Know Who
This weekend 's Radio Derb podcast is up on iTunes and can also be listened to onscreen . The transcript is here .
In the leadoff segment I tackle Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor 's interview on the 60 Minutes news show .
[ Audio clip : ] `` The first day I received in high school a card from Princeton telling me that it was possible that I was going to get in , I was stopped by the school nurse and asked why I was sent a possible and the number one and the number two in the class were not . Now I did n't know about affirmative action . But from the tone of their question I understood that they thought there was something wrong with them looking at me and not looking at those other two students . ''
I have to side with the school nurse here . There absolutely was something wrong . While private institutions ought to be free to discriminate in any way they like , Princeton is only theoretically private . They get scads of taxpayer money by way of research grants , student financial support , and so on . They should not be discriminating in favor of high-school students claiming some kind of minority status .
And what kind , anyway ? Sonia Sotomayor is as white as I am . I have never seen any evidence that they or any of their ancestors suffered state-sponsored injustice at the hands of the United States . Why are they the recipient of favoritism ?
Next question : Why are they so breathtakingly , hair-raisingly , toe-curlingly , stomach-churningly , spleen-splittingly insensitive ? Did they not , and do they still not , understand why that school nurse would be vexed by Number One and Number Two students being passed over in favor of Number Three , just because Number Three had parents from Puerto Rico ? She , this `` wise Latina , '' really does not possess the few molecules of wisdom required to understand someone 's resentment at elite colleges showing favoritism to Puerto Ricans ? Including Puerto Ricans who would not look out of place at an Aryan Nations clambake ? . . .
We on the left sometimes joke about exporting extreme Republicans to their own country . Some on the right , such as Rick Perry and Todd Palin , are n't joking about it , but they want to take their states with them . But what if there were already a country that perfectly suits the ideals of what Republicans want for America ? There is ! I often disagree with Nicholas Kristof , but this time , they struck gold .
With Tea Party conservatives and many Republicans balking at raising the debt ceiling , let me offer them an example of a nation that lives up to their ideals . It has among the lowest tax burdens of any major country : fewer than 2 percent of the people pay any taxes . Government is limited , so that burdensome regulations never kill jobs . This society embraces traditional religious values and a conservative sensibility . Nobody minds school prayer , same-sex marriage is n't imaginable , and criminals are never coddled . The budget priority is a strong military , the nation 's most respected institution . When generals decide on a policy for , say , Afghanistan , politicians defer to them . Citizens are deeply patriotic , and nobody burns flags . So what is this Republican Eden , this Utopia ? Why , it 's Pakistan…

Columbia University students under investigation for the disruption of a recent event hosted by the campus chapter of the College Republicans have been banned from attending the group 's programming while the inquiry is ongoing .
Provost John Coatsworth gave those instructions to students being investigated for responsibility in the Oct. 10 shout-down of a CUCR-hosted talk via webcam with Tommy Robinson , a far-right British politician and white nationalist activist , student paper the Columbia Daily Spectator reported Tuesday .
Robinson 's talk was almost immediately derailed due to chants from left-wing protesters , many of whom held signs reading `` hate speech=violence , '' the Spectator reported .
Coatsworth 's unusual instructions come ahead of a CUCR event featuring alt-right conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich , scheduled to speak on Oct. 30 about `` the Rise of the Alternative Media . ''
Coatsworth told the Spectator they were permitted to issue sanctions prior to the conclusion of an investigation into student conduct , as the university leadership has the power to prevent a `` demonstration [ that ] poses a clear and present danger '' to the university community .
The provost suggested that the student protesters could come to an agreement with administrators in which the ban would be lifted , or the case dropped altogether . The students would be expected to `` pledge not to disrupt events , '' said Coatsworth .
Should the inquiry proceed and students found responsible for impeding the free speech rights of Robinson and CUCR , disciplinary action could be imposed , including expulsion .
A petition launched Monday titled `` Do n't Discipline Students for Protesting White Supremacy , '' which takes issue with the administrative response to the Robinson incident , has garnered nearly 5,000 signatures .
Also this week , fliers were posted around the Columbia campus featuring the pictures , names , and personal information of CUCR 's executive board members .
The New York City Anti-Fascist Action group took credit , condemning CUCR for hosting Cernovich and writing on social media , `` They never thought they would have to face consequences for inviting fascists to speak at their campus . We believe otherwise . If you see these people , let them know what you think… ''
CUCR noted on Facebook that `` [ our ] invitation of Mr. Cernovich is not an endorsement of their views . ''
One after another , a parade of Democrats went before the microphone , held up a flier with a picture on it : a grandmother in Arkansas , an unemployed mother in Ohio , a veteran , a cancer survivor , on and on , all faces of the hungry in America . Flustered by the theatrics , Republican Pete Sessions of Texas sought to clarify the GOP 's proposed $ 40 billion cut in food stamps , or SNAP , the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , explaining that only able-bodied adults would be removed from the rolls if they 're not looking for work .
Democrat Jim McGovern countered that if their Republican colleague had trouble with the waivers that allow governors to exempt people from the work requirements associated with receiving government benefits , “ you should talk to your governor. ” Texas Gov . Rick Perry is among those who requested waivers for their states during the economic downturn because there were no jobs , and they were n't going to let people go hungry .
Those waivers are one of the reasons SNAP ballooned to cover some 47 million people . Almost half of them are children ; two thirds of the adults are women . Those able-bodied men the Republicans have such a hard time helping have families , or they are working , but ca n't make ends meet without assistance . If cuts of the magnitude the GOP is proposing go through , 3.5 million Americans would lose their benefits , including 170,000 veterans .
Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly borrowed a quote from the McCarthy era , posing the question to their Republican colleagues , “ Have you no decency ? ” Behind the scenes Thursday , Democrats were scrambling to see if they could get enough Republicans to defeat the bill . It passed 217-210 , with only Republicans voting in favor , but the dirty little secret is that pass or fail , the next step in the process is a conference with the Senate , which passed a farm bill with a $ 5 billion cut in SNAP . “ In some ways , it 's a show vote , an attempt by Republicans to move the target to the right , ” says James Weill , the president of the Food Research and Action Center .
Sessions conceded as much , saying passage of the bill would “ arm ” Rep. Frank Lucas , the Oklahoma Republican who chairs the agriculture committee , when they go into conference with the Senate to reconcile the two vastly different bills . Minnesota Democrat Collin Peterson , ranking member on the ag committee , said , “ There 's no reason to pass this bill except to placate some people . The bill is going nowhere , so I do n't know what we 're doing . All this bill does is make it harder to pass a new farm bill ; harder , not impossible . ”
The backstory of the SNAP bill is as much about internal Republican Party dynamics as it is about Republicans versus Democrats . After the GOP failed to pass a farm bill this summer , the leadership separated farm subsidies from food stamps , breaking a historic bond that had benefited both rural and urban interests . The GOP then passed a stand-alone farm bill that significantly boosted crop subsidies , long derided by conservatives as wasteful , even as House Republicans doubled down on cuts to SNAP , from $ 20 billion to $ 40 billion .
The conservative National Review in an online editorial said the GOP 's focus on food stamps shows “ a total tin ear to American politics , ” pointing out that Mitt Romney lost because voters did n't think they cared about average Americans . “ And why are conservatives overlooking a far more egregious abuse of taxpayer dollars in the farm bill ? ”
McGovern complained that the bill members voted on Thursday was “ written in Eric Cantor 's living room. ” What they meant by that is the GOP leadership took their cues from Heritage Action , Club for Growth , and Americans for Prosperity , far-right groups driving the debate in a hyperpartisan political climate along with Fox News , which repeatedly aired news of a California surfer dude bragging that they were buying lobster and sushi with food stamps .
With or without these cuts , Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf said enrollment in the program would be declining as the economy improves . SNAP is structured to expand during hard times , and historically the numbers come down , with the average amount of time a recipient spends on the program just nine months .
The food-stamp program has been a huge success , says Weill , historically attracting bipartisan support and picking up the slack in an economy where median family income , according to census data released this week , has n't budged in decades—and where the bottom 20 to 30 percent is losing ground . “ It 's a victim of its own success , with Republicans saying it 's just too big , government is too large , ” says Weill . They note with a touch of irony that the most successful government programs today are food stamps and quantitative easing . You could say they 're both government handouts , but only when the least among us get them is there a political ruckus .
As if to underscore the double standard , CNN reported on a Democratic member of congress outing two GOP lawmakers for dining out on government subsidies , while voting to deny basic food assistance to the poor .
The genetically modified apples , produced by Canadian company Okanagan Specialty Fruits , have been under review by US regulatory agencies since 2010 . If approved , they would become the second GMO fruit to be allowed in the country . The new , genetically modified apples do not bruise or brown.Americans may soon be biting into the future of apples.Pending approval by the US Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration , genetically modified apples could get the green light to appear supermarket shelves.Dubbed “ botox apples ” because they are designed to prevent bruising and browning , Arctic Granny Smith and Arctic Golden Delicious apples made by Canada 's Okanagan Specialty Fruits have been under review by US regulatory agencies since 2010 and could become the second genetically modified fruit to be allowed in the country. “ Not only do they have significant potential to reduce food waste , the resistance to browning results in better taste , texture and likely a retention of healthful components like vitamin C and antioxidants , which are typically burned up in the browning reaction , ” Joel Brooks , marketing specialist at Okanagan , told the Washington Times.Apple growers in Washington state oppose Okanagan 's bid to bring its scientifically enhanced fruit to market . The Northwest Horticultural Council fears that genetic drift from GMO crops will contaminate fields of organic apples , and result in loss of European sales , where the crops have not been approved.Neal Carter , president of Okanagan Specialty Fruit , says they expect the USDA and the FDA to give their approval to have the company 's apples deregulated by the end of the year.Neal Carter , president of Okanagan Specialty Fruit , says they expect the USDA and the FDA to give their approval to have the company 's apples deregulated by the end of the year.Like Monsanto , the world 's leading producer of GMO seed stock , Okanagan has come out against the kind of mandatory labeling standards that are in place in the European Union and much of the developed world , but the company says it will voluntarily identify its apples with a sticker that reads `` Arctic . `` “ We as a company do n't support mandatory labeling because we feel it basically undermines the regulatory process , ” Neal Carter , president and founder of Okanagan , told Chemical & Engineering News . “ We 've gone through a three-year , very rigorous process and the result of that is that it 's deemed to be as safe as any other apple . Finally they expect you to put a label on it like a scare tactic against GMOs. ” Naturally occurring enzymes cause browning and bruising in apples , but Okanagan scientists were able to suppress their production and therefore prevent discoloration.Carter is optimistic that their company will get the green light from US regulators and that the genetically enhanced apples will soon join the Hawaiian papaya as the only two genetically modified fruits to be available in produce aisles. “ We expect a second US public comment period , which will be 30 days long , to open within the next few months and anticipate full US deregulation later in 2013 , ” explained Carter.Source : www.nydailynews.com

* Hollande says state can coordinate industrial revival
* Hard-pressed government will turn to private sector for bulk of funds
* France is a “ country of inventors ” and must remain so
By Nicholas Vinocur
PARIS , Sept 12 ( Reuters ) - Francois Hollande laid out a 10-year roadmap on Thursday to revive French industry by promoting new technologies to drive job creation , but which offered little public money from stretched state coffers .
The Socialist president , whose 2014 national budget next month will focus on curbing spending , vowed to turn back what they called a ‘ lost decade ' of conservative rule in which some 700,000 jobs fled domestic industries .
But the scheme will rely heavily on private investment and the government will act mostly as a coordinator to spur growth in 34 priority areas , from driverless cars to electric planes and a new generation of high-speed trains .
“ France is a nation of inventors , pioneers and producers , ” Hollande said , citing France 's role in previous centuries and decades in developing technologies from the steam engine to hot-air balloons and rechargeable batteries .
“ We have a duty to remain so , ” they added , nonetheless insisting the plan was not a return to the so-called “ dirigiste ” state-directed industrial policies of the 1960s and 1970s .
France 's new Public Investment Bank will be on hand to offer credit for innovation - no amount was specified - but officials said they hoped to match every euro of public money invested with 10 euros raised from private investors .
State-appointed “ industrial officers ” will press firms to work together and develop successors to French projects of the past such as the supersonic Concorde or high-speed TGV train - both fruits of state-funded research plans .
With unemployment stuck above 10 percent and the government forced this week to cut its 2014 growth forecast , Hollande is fighting to lift their approval ratings above 30 percent . They hope such a determined display of optimism will help raise hopes for the future among the French .
But while officials say 475,000 jobs can be created or preserved if their roadmap is followed over 10 years , current data remains grim , with 49,600 industrial jobs lost in the year to August , according to the INSEE statistics office .
DRIVERLESS CARS , ELECTRIC PLANES
Most new designs presented to Hollande at the exhibition were built by industrial giants such as car-maker Renault , automotive parts group Valeo or aerospace giant EADS .
Flanked by Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg , Hollande was shown robot technology , models of an electric plane built by EADS , a driverless car being developed by Renault-Nissan and an ultra-fuel efficient vehicle being tested in Peugeot 's laboratories that would retail at 15,000 euros ( $ 20,000 ) .
At present both Peugeot and Renault are struggling to maintain production in France due to high labour costs and employment laws that make it tricky to adjust staffing levels .
Montebourg has not lacked ideas to stimulate industry , for example creating an online tool to help businesses that have moved abroad re-calculate production costs in France .
But clear successes are elusive , despite their declaration after 10 months on the job that their mediation with vulnerable companies has saved some 60,000 threatened industrial jobs .
More jobs are still leaving France than coming home . Figures from March showed that for 44 companies which had returned production to France since 2009 , 267 had outsourced activities , according to the Observatoire de l'Investissement .

Las Gorras Blancas ( Spanish for `` The White Caps '' ) was a group active in the New Mexico Territory and American Southwest in the late 1880s and early 1890s , in response to Anglo-American squatters . Founded in April 1889 by brothers Juan Jose , Pablo , and Nicanor Herrera , with support from vecinos in the New Mexico Territory pueblo communities of El Burro , El Salitre , Ojitos Frios , and San Geronimo , in present day San Miguel County . [ 1 ]
History [ edit ]
After the northern Mexican frontier became part of the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ( 1848 ) and the Gadsden Purchase ( 1853 ) , Anglo Americans began immigrating in large numbers to the newly acquired territories . Anglos began taking lands from both Native Americans and Hispanos by different means , most notably by squatting . Squatters often then sold these lands to land speculators for huge profits , especially after the passing of the 1862 Homestead Act . Hispanos demanded that their lands be returned to them but the governments did not respond favorably . For example , the Surveyor of General Claims Office of the New Mexico Territory would at times take up to fifty years to process a claim , meanwhile , the lands were being grabbed up by the newcomers . One tactic used to defraud Hispanos from their lands was that they needed to present English language documentation of ownership , which , due to previously being part of Mexico , could only present Spanish language documentation . While the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was built in the 1890s , speculators known as the Santa Fe Ring , orchestrated schemes to disland natives from their possessions . In response , Hispanos gathered to reclaim lands taken by the Anglo−Americans . [ 2 ] Hoping to scare off the new immigrants , they eventually used intimidation and raids to accomplish their goals . They sought to develop a class-based consciousness among local people through the everyday tactics of resistance to the economic and social order confronting common property land grant communities . The name comes from the white head coverings many wore .
Tactics [ edit ]
In the early 1890s , a depressed sheep and wool market affected the Northern New Mexico economy adversely . Communal lands dictated by the original land grants were increasingly being split up and fenced off as private land , and pastures were not as plentiful . This was most felt by the Hispano farmers who relied on the communal lands to raise their stock . Las Gorras Blancas tore down fences , burned barns and haystacks , scattered livestock and threatened worse if justice did not prevail . Additionally , a group of Las Gorras Blancas under the direction of Juan Jose Herrera `` set thousands of railroad ties afire when the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad refused to raise the low wages it paid '' Hispano workers . [ 3 ] Moreover , there were numerous demonstrations by men wearing white caps , who rode through the Las Vegas , New Mexico streets at night on horseback , typically ending at the courthouse .
In August 1890 several members of Las Gorras Blancas ran for the New Mexico Legislature in a new populist People 's Party under the name El Partido del Pueblo Unido . Pablo Herrera , Nestor Montoya , and T.B . Mills were all elected and most forms of direct action that the group was known for ceased . All three were unsuccessful in passing populist legislation and left the state government disillusioned with political reform . [ 1 ] Pablo Herrera , in a speech to the State House of Representatives in February 1891 , stated :
Gentleman , I have served several years time in the penitentiary , but only sixty days in the legislature . I have watched the proceedings here carefully . I would like to say that the time I spent in the penitentiary was more enjoyable than the time I have spent here . There is more honesty in the halls of the Territorial prison than in the halls of the legislature . I would prefer another term in prison than another election to the House .
Pablo Herrera returned to Las Vegas and attempted to revive Las Gorras Blancas but was murdered by sheriff Felipe Lopez . Some time after the movement died , Juan Jose Herrera left New Mexico and settled in Utah , where they died several years later . [ 1 ]
Declaration [ edit ]
In the March 12 , 1890 , issue of the Las Vegas Optic , Las Gorras Blancas−The White Caps members issued the Proclamation of Las Gorras Blancas : [ 4 ]
Not wishing to be misunderstood , we hereby make this our declaration . Our purpose is to protect the rights and interests of the people in general ; especially those of the helpless classes . We want the Las Vegas Grant settled to the benefit of all concerned , and this we hold is the entire community within the grant . We want no `` land grabbers '' or obstructionists of any sort to interfere . We will watch them . We are not down on lawyers as a class , but the usual knavery and unfair treatment of the people must be stopped . Our judiciary hereafter must understand that we will sustain it only when `` Justice '' is its watchword . The practice of `` double-dealing '' must cease . There is a wide difference between New Mexico 's `` law '' and `` justice . '' And justice is God 's law , and that we must have at all hazards . We are down on race issues , and will watch race agitators . We are all human brethren , under the same glorious flag . We favor irrigation enterprises , but will fight any scheme that tends to monopolize the supply of water courses to the detriment of residents living on lands watered by the same streams . We favor all enterprises , but object to corrupt methods to further the same . We do not care how much you get so long as you do it fairly and honestly . The People are suffering from the effects of partisan `` bossism '' and these bosses had better quietly hold their peace . The people have been persecuted and hacked about in every which way to satisfy their caprice . If they persist in their usual methods retribution will be their reward . We are watching `` political informers . '' We have no grudge against any person in particular , but we are the enemies of bulldozers and tyrants . We must have a free ballot and a fair count . And the will of the majority shall be respected . Intimidation and the `` indictment '' plan have no further fears for us . If the old system should continue , death would be a relief to our sufferings . And for our rights our lives are the least we can pledge . If the fact that we are law abiding citizens is questioned , come out to our homes and see the hunger and desolation we are suffering ; and `` this '' is the result of the deceitful and corrupt methods of `` bossism . '' Be fair and just and we are with you , do otherwise and take the consequences . '' The White Caps , 1,500 Strong and Growing Daily

Aung San Oo as an infant .
Aung San Oo ( Burmese : အောင်ဆန်းဦး ) is the elder brother of State Counsellor of Myanmar and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi ; the two are the only surviving children of Burmese independence leader Aung San . Aung San Oo is an engineer . Aung San Oo has been described by the Burmese Lawyers ' Council and the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma as a potential surrogate of the junta in an attempt to humiliate Aung San Suu Kyi and place them in an untenable position . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Time magazine reports that , according to Burmese exiles and observers in Rangoon , the junta used the alleged surrogacy of Aung San Oo and their lawsuit as an act of spite against the National League for Democracy leader . [ 3 ]
Aung San Oo was educated in England and immigrated to the United States in 1973 . [ 4 ] Their wife , Lei Lei Nwe Thein ( also spelled Leilei Nwe Thein ) , is also an American citizen . [ 5 ]
The lawsuit [ edit ]
Aung San Oo is estranged from their sister ; while Suu Kyi has become the leader of the Burmese National League for Democracy party , Oo is close to the ruling military junta . In 2000 , Oo brought legal action against Suu Kyi in the Rangoon High Court demanding a half-share in the family home , where they had been held under intermittent house arrest from 1989 to 2010 . There was widespread speculation among observers at the time that Aung San Oo would then sell their half-share to the junta , [ 2 ] but the High Court ruled against Oo , much to the surprise of the same observers , who had assumed that it would bring down whatever verdict was preferred by the junta . [ 3 ] The Burmese Lawyers ' Council describes the lawsuit as an attempt by the junta to publicly humiliate the leader of the National League for Democracy . [ 1 ] The Burmese Government in exile claims that had Aung San Oo won their case , they would have put Aung San Suu Kyi in an extremely precarious position . [ 2 ] In the Time article it is also reported that the junta may have used this legal manoeuver to `` back Aung San Suu Kyi into a corner '' , despite advice to the contrary by the visiting former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto the year before the lawsuit . [ 3 ]
The mansion [ edit ]
Aung San Oo 's mansion in Bagan , 2007
Since 2005 , Aung San Oo has been constructing a large mansion on a prime location within the exclusive Archaeological Zone in Bagan . Oo himself , as a U.S. citizen , can not legally hold property in Burma ( it was on this basis that the Rangoon High Court dismissed their claim for a half-share in the house in Rangoon ) , but their wife 's family is understood to be acting as proxy on their behalf . Their wife , Daw Lei Lei Nwe Thein , is rumoured to harbour political ambitions for Oo through their connections with the junta , although there is no independent source to confirm these rumours .

Ok , so let 's address some common questions !
Q : What is this ‘ Digital engine ' ?
A : The digital engine refers our high quality sample playback engine . We have taken great care in our implementation to ensure that samples are played back and transposed in a musical and great sounding way .
Q : Are those pads or buttons ?
A : They are high grade plastic , laser engraved , button caps that allow the mechanical RGB illuminated switches underneath to shine through . The switches are quality mechanical linear action key switches that will last a very long time , and feel great to use .
Q : Is that an OLED screen ?
A : You bet . It is a contrast rich OLED screen with a 128x64 pixel resolution .
The GUI is designed from scratch for the Digitakt and the new screen .
Q : This is just a small boat , where is our flagship ? !
A : Why not both ? We have not stopped working on ‘ big ' projects .
With the Digitakt we are finally dipping our toes into a more economic and simple instrument , which is something we have been thinking about doing for a long time .
Q : So what 's in it for me , who already owns This or That ?
A : It all depends on your workflow and preference .
The Digitakt offers a streamlined approach to the Elektron workflow , and a clear set of functionalities that will allow you to focus on your creative goals .
For those who want to just sit down and make beats , compose and play around with samples and sampling - the Digitakt will be perfect . The simple , yet very competent functionality and the small , yet rugged footprint makes the Digitakt an apt companion for both your bedroom and the club .
Q : Is the sampling fast and straight forward ?
A : Yes !
Q : What about the MIDI sequencer , is it polyphonic ?
A : The MIDI sequencer has the same great features found in our Analog series , such as Trig Conditions and Parameter Locks . It features a +3 note offset on every step so that you can sequence chords . ( Up to four notes )
Q : Mono ? 8 tracks ? 64MB ? Is n't that a bit meager for 2017 ?
A : The Digitakt is designed for working with drums , both in one shots and sample chains . The mixing per track is in stereo , so you will be able to spatialize you drums to your heart 's content .
The Digitakt also has a Project structure , which means that you have 1GB of storage to load 64MB of samples to each project . Loading and saving projects is a breeze , and will keep things tidy for you .
Regarding the track count , keep in mind that these are 8 sample tracks of our Elektron signature sequencer , with all the bells and whistles from its bigger siblings . Each step can be locked with a different sample and parameters .
We work with proper embedded processors and hardcore programming to achieve a stable and extremely responsive instrument . We believe that hardware should be hardware , and not a computer in a shiny case .
And lastly , there are more details to come . See you in April .
Cheers from a suddenly snowy Gothenburg !
The Adventures of Bob Hope is an American celebrity comics comic book series that was published by National Periodical Publications ( an imprint of DC Comics ) . The series featured stories based on comedian Bob Hope , as well as assorted other humorous stories . The series ran for 109 issues from 1950 through 1968 .
Publication history [ edit ]
In the early 1950s , with sales for superhero themed comics on the decline , National Periodical Publications began licensing the right to use celebrity images , including Jerry Lewis , Dean Martin , Alan Ladd , and Bob Hope . Issue # 1 ( cover dated February–March 1950 ) set the tone for most of the 1950s . The lead story would feature Hope in a misadventure similar to their film roles ; the back up stories tended to revolve around movie-related themes or characters . For example , issue # 1 had a story on Rhonda Fleming , Hope 's co-star in the 1949 film The Great Lover . [ 1 ]
By the 1960s , sales for the Hope series began to flag . The editors attempted to add some contemporary humor by introducing the character Super-Hip in issue # 95 . [ 2 ] Despite the changes , the series was canceled with issue # 109 ( March 1968 ) .
Artists and writers [ edit ]
The first four issues featured photographs of Hope on the cover ; subsequent covers were illustrated . Owen Fitzgerald was the original artist for the series . [ 3 ] They were eventually replaced by Bob Oksner , who provided the majority of the artwork for the run of the series . [ 4 ] Oksner was replaced by Neal Adams for the final four issues . [ 5 ]
There were no story credits , though some sources credit Cal Howard with writing some early scripts . [ 6 ] Beginning with issue # 88 ( Sept. 1964 ) , Arnold Drake received a byline , and would go on to write most of the scripts for rest of the series run . [ 7 ]
DC 's iconic team of world-saving superheroes will finally unite for the first time on the big screen when Justice League premieres on November 17 . Superman ( Henry Cavill ) , Batman ( Ben Affleck ) , Wonder Woman ( Gal Gadot ) , Aquaman ( Jason Momoa ) , the Flash ( Ezra Miller ) , and Cyborg ( Ray Fisher ) will come together through the combined efforts of Bruce Wayne 's Batman and Diana Prince 's Wonder Woman to save the world from an impending evil .
Here are the most important things to know about Justice League . Spoilers , obviously , follow .
If the world has learned anything about Justice League , it 's that the film will be jam-packed with DC comics lore and that it will act as the catalyst to set up a whole bunch of DC movie dominos for the near-ish future . Justice League will be DC 's version of Marvel 's The Avengers : ( hopefully ) well-balanced while managing to introduce a slew of iconic heroes to each other as they try their hardest to band together .
First of all , there seems to be a pretty solid plot
The film 's official plot summary reads as follows :
Fueled by their restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman 's ( Henry Cavill ) selfless act , Bruce Wayne ( Ben Affleck ) enlists newfound ally Diana Prince to face an even greater threat . Together , Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to recruit a team to stand against this newly awakened enemy . Despite the formation of an unprecedented league of heroes — Batman , Wonder Woman , Aquaman , Cyborg and The Flash — it may be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions .
Justice League is still directed by Zack Snyder
Dubbed the “ Snyder-verse , ” DC 's Justice League film franchise is being headed up by none other than Zack Snyder , the director behind Man of Steel and Batman v Superman , as well as a few other non-DC movies ( 300 , Watchmen , Sucker Punch ) .
Superman will , uh , return
Despite Superman 's demise at the end of BvS and their subsequent funeral , Snyder has promised that Henry Cavill 's Clark Kent will play a large role in Justice League . Fans are pretty convinced , given the multiple appearances of an all-black Superman suit on set , that this storyline will follow the Death of Superman comic closely .
And the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight still are n't friends
Cavill revealed in December 2016 that Clark and Bruce would be disagreeing in the future over who should hold the League 's leadership role , as is pretty classic for their characters .
DC is making an active effort to lighten things up
Ezra Miller 's Barry Allen — the Flash — will , supposedly , play the role of the comedic relief , which will be a welcome change from BvS 's sluggishly dark tone . Flash is the young , quippy member of the team — the obnoxious little brother who can hopefully add some levity . Hopefully .
“ Mistakenly in the past I think the studio has said , ‘ Oh , DC films are gritty and dark , and that 's what makes them different , ” Geoff Johns , DC Comics 's chief creative officer , said in September 2016 of upcoming DC films . “ That could n't be more wrong . Even Batman has a glimmer of [ optimism ] in him . If they did n't think he 'd make tomorrow better , he 'd stop . ”
Look out for Steppenwolf
The infamous , classic DC baddie Steppenwolf will be portrayed by Ciaran Hinds and will be a motion-capture character a la their deleted scenes with Lex Luthor in BvS .
Also , be on the lookout for a Parademon scene with actual context , the Mother Boxes and the New Gods .
The Aquaman storyline will get a kickstart in Justice League
Willem Dafoe — who will be portraying the villainous , Atlantean extremist Vulko in 2018 's Aquaman — will be making an appearance in Justice League as a way to more fully introduce Arthur Curry 's story as more than just theirs being “ that guy who can talk to fish . ”

Cyborg is still a bit of a mystery , and expect a Green Lantern
Precious little is known about Ray Fisher 's Victor Stone/Cyborg and the role he 'll play in Justice League . Warner Bros. has a Cyborg film planned for 2020 . It 's worth noting that DC 's Cyborg comics during its Rebirth have categorized the hero 's story as body horror , which we saw a bit of in Batman v Superman .
The Cyborg film will come around the same time as the Green Lantern movie , featuring Hal Jordan and John Stewart . But before the Snyderverse introduces its non-Ryan Reynolds Lantern , an alien Green Lantern is expected to make an appearance in Justice League , really setting up a tie-in for Green Lantern League members .
Batman is super into guns now
On top of a brand new tactical suit that really got DC fans riled up , Batman is way more into guns than they ever has been before on the big screen . It certainly follows the inherent violence and darkness of this latest round of DC movies and feels rather pointed , especially since at least one of the Dark Knight 's guns is rocking a Joker sticker . There 's a reason for that .
Batman is still obsessed with the Joker for killing a Robin
DC fans were treated to the sad knowledge that one of the Robins was killed by the Joker in the Snyderverse . While audiences still are n't sure which one , the addition of a Nightwing movie to the DC cinematic universe opens up the possibility for a lot of Robin-centric stories — including Red Hood , a storyline that involves Joker killing Jason Todd 's Robin and them coming back as the villainous Red Hood .
But Batman does n't , historically , let things go very easily . He 's a bit of a grudge holder — and if there 's one thing worthy of not being let go , it 's the murder of one of their adopted kids .
Wonder Woman is not queer in this universe
Gadot confirmed a while back that Diana Prince 's canon bisexuality will not be apparent in the Snyderverse .
“ It 's not something we 've explored , ” Gadot told Variety in October 2016 . “ In this movie they do not experience any bisexual relationships . But it 's not about that . She 's a woman who loves people for who they are . They can be bisexual . They love people for their hearts . ”
Justice League premieres in theaters November 17 .

I think its because of rounding , the game uses nice whole numbers and since the numbers are quite low it might really be 10.9 rounded down and that would make it a bit less impactful . It is what it is we just need to know how important the rerouting actually is for damage . or the other way to put it is +25 % and +30 % making them a relatively similar increase . Engines have a lot more power than phasers and shields in canon so it makes sense routing out of them into the system has a big impact .
Kellyanne Conway boasted Monday that she 's never uttered the words 'fake news ' during a contentious interview on CNN that aired uninterrupted by commercial breaks for more than half an hour .
The Trump counselor did try to shame the network , however , for its heavy coverage of Russia 's election meddling and allegations of Trump campaign collusion .
'Are n't you the least bit reluctant , if not embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America ? ' they asked New Day host Chris Cuomo early on .
Russia came up during that broadcast because Don Jr , the president 's son , admitted to meeting with a Russian government advocate last summer at Trump Tower under the auspices of obtaining damaging information on Hillary Clinton .

Kellyanne Conway boasted Monday that she 's never uttered the words 'fake news ' during a contentious interview on CNN with Chris Cuomo that aired uninterrupted by commercial breaks for more than half an hour
The Trump counselor did try to shame the network , however , for its heavy coverage of Russia 's election meddling and allegations of Trump campaign collusion
Russia came up during that broadcast because Don Jr , the president 's son , admitted to meeting with a Russian government advocate last summer at Trump Tower under the auspices of obtaining damaging information on Hillary Clinton
After the contentious 35-minute segment , Kellyanne Conway reiterated their point on Twitter : that CNN wants to talk about Russia , while they wanted to talk about the United States
They say they did not know who the meeting was with , as it had been set up by an acquaintance .
The woman turned out to be Natalia Veselnitskaya , a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin .
'Don Jr. has very explicitly stated they did n't even know the name of the person with whom they were meeting , ' Conway said Monday on CNN . 'He agreed to the meeting based on a contact from the Miss Universe Pageant . '
Conway went on to run Donald Trump 's presidential campaign and help put them in the White House . But they were not in charge of the campaign at the time of the meeting with Veselnitskaya .
Paul Manafort was still running the show in June . They were soon shoved out as they became embroiled in an international scandal involving a former Ukrainian client . Conway took over for him .
The president 's son-in-law , Jared Kushner , also attended the meeting , at Don Jr 's invitation , the New York Times reported and Kushner confirmed .
Kushner is now a senior advisor at the White House .
The president 's son tried to brush off the rising controversy on Monday morning as Conway went to bat for them
On CNN , Conway reiterated Don Jr 's claims that the information that was offered was a cover for a conversation about a Russian adoption program that was halted years ago amid a dispute with the US over the Magnitsky Act .
'They get into the meeting and it quickly turns into a pretext for Russian adoption , according to their statements , that the comments this woman is making about any type of information on Hillary Clinton were vague . They were meaningless , ' they said . 'Others exited the meeting very quickly . The meeting itself was very brief . '
Conway said on CNN , 'There was no information given . There was no action taken . There was no follow-up .
'And let me respectfully say , as well as I can , I do n't think anybody had to look very far to find damaging information on Hillary Clinton and negative information , ' they argued .
Cuomo told them that their last statement was 'beside the point . '
There are 'huge legal and ethical implications , ' they said , to the meeting that Don Jr. had with the Russian lawyer who wanted to lobby the Republican presidential candidate 's campaign on lifting the US law that inspired Putin to halt Russian adoptions .
The CNN host said they could n't decide what should be more troubling to the White House - that Don Jr. did n't know who they were meeting with or that they invited Manafort and Kushner to sit down with a stranger on the promise of obtaining oppo research on Clinton .
'First of all , you keep on saying opposition research the way you guys constantly vomit words like collusion , and Russian interference , and affecting the election , all of which you have no evidence . We can not convert wishful thinking into hard evidence , ' Conway answered .
They said the meeting is not evidence of collusion with the Russians to bring down Clinton .
'If we were in court , your side would not even survive a motion to dismiss a motion for summary judgement because you 've got nothing , ' they said .
Cuomo busted up Don Jr. fort they same thing , claiming in the course of the interview with Conway that they have a credibility problem because they gave two differing versions of their story to the New York Times for its articles on the June 2016 meeting
Trump says they did not know who the meeting was with , as it had been set up by an acquaintance . The woman turned out to be Natalia Veselnitskaya , a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin
The principals from the campaign were all there because they had a very small team , they said .
'This was standard operating procedure for the campaign , ' Conway asserted . 'Let 's focus on what did not happen in that meeting . No information provided that was meaningful . No action taken . Nothing . '
Cuomo continued to bust up Don Jr. for their conduct , claiming in the course of the interview that the Trump son has a credibility problem because they gave two differing versions of their story to the New York Times for its articles on the June 2016 meeting .
The first time they said : 'It was a short introductory meeting . I asked Jared and Paul to stop by . We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government , but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up . '
They said in a later statement : 'After pleasantries were exchanged , the woman stated that they had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton .
'Her statements were vague , ambiguous and made no sense . No details or supporting information was provided or even offered . It quickly became clear that they had no meaningful information . '
Having read the Trump son 's statement aloud , Cuomo told Conway , 'You talked about being in a court of law , not good when you change your story . '
President Trump tweeted that James Comey 'leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media ' this morning as their son came under fire for meeting with the Russian lawyer . Conway brought up the charge aginst the former FBI director , too , as they attempted to pull Cuomo off Don Jr .
Conway fired back , ' I admire your moxie , sitting there with the CNN chyron right near you , talking about credibility issues , given the couple weeks you guy have had . '
' I could not be more proud to have that CNN chyron next to me , ' Cuomo told them 'And I could be more proud representing the White House here on CNN , ' Conway responded .
Cuomo talked over Conway throughout the interview , prompting them to declare then that the CNN host should let them know when she 's allowed to speak again .
When Cuomo would n't let them talk , Conway laughed and said their name a couple of times in a sing-songy voice as they tried to get their attention .
'You wanted to produce something because you 're invested in months now as a network in something that simply does n't exist , ' they finally said , trying to lump the story about Don Jr. in with other charges of Russian collusion that have not panned out .
Cuomo told her , 'No , that 's an assumption by you . And it 's an unfair premise . '
Changing the subject Conway told him , 'No , Chris . That 's not true . Here is the unfair premise , that we are talking about this again . Yet again . That you talk about Russia more than you talk about America . That the big bombshell of the day is Jim Comey having classified information , conversations with the President of the United States , in their memorandum . '
ALSO AT THE MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN LAWYER : Jared Kushner , the president 's son-in-law , attended the Trump Tower meeting , too , at this brother-in-law 's request
That charge led Cuomo to note with glee that the article they were referring to was based on anonymous sources like the ones the White House has routinely tried to undermine .
'Unnamed sources is the new code word for you guys on fake news but it 's okay for Comey , ' they snarked .
Conway told him , ' I 've actually never uttered those two words , either . But the fact is that report is a bombshell people should know about… '
Cuomo pointed out again that the report is based on 'unnamed sources . '
'You just want to interrupt me today , ' Conway said , summing up the interaction with their 'friend . '
They said on Twitter after it was all over : 'To me pal @ ChrisCuomo : Here 's how you and I are different : you want to talk about Russia ; I want to talk about America . '
President Donald Trump had also marveled at the report that said their fired FBI Director James Comey 's memos contained classified information , a revelation that could get the ex-government official in trouble for giving them to their friend to pass on to the press .
'James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media . That is so illegal ! ' Trump wrote Monday morning , shortly after retweeting a Fox News story that reported the allegation .
It was the Hill newspaper , on Sunday night , that first broke the news that most of the memos written by the former FBI chief contained classified information , a welcome distraction for the president and their advisers as Don Jr. comes under fire for meeting with Veselnitskaya , .
Comey could now be probed by congressional investigators to determine whether they mishandled classified information .
ALLEN PARK -- The Detroit Lions continue to shake up their defense following a humbling loss against the Cleveland Browns . Only this time they did n't add a guy . They just promoted one . Rookie cornerback Darius Slay was elevated to the first team for both weekend practices following a 24-6 loss Thursday against Cleveland . He 's playing on the right side , a position that had been held by veteran Ron Bartell .
Darius Slay , right , defends a pass intended for Micheal Spurlock during a recent Detroit Lions practice .
The second-rounder out of Mississippi State now is looking like a good bet to start Thursday against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots ( 7:30 p.m. , WXYZ-TV ) . `` There were some guys in the first couple preseason games that we wanted to get more reps , '' coach Jim Schwartz said . `` We really do n't have depth charts right now , but we do have rotations . He 's getting some good reps , but that 's because of their play in the preseason games . The greatest reward is the opportunity to do more . '' Slay was n't targeted at all agains the New York Jets , and just once last week against the Browns . They made three tackles . Their man-coverage skills have been particularly impressive , even in one-on-one drills that are designed to favor the receiver . They said their progress was slowed slightly earlier in camp after the Lions tweaked the technique they learned at Mississippi State , but they have felt increasingly comfortable in the past few days . Now he 's trying to develop their press-coverage technique . `` He 's patient in their press technique . Their man-to-man coverage is good , '' Schwartz said . `` There are still a lot of things like a lot of the rookies . There are still a lot of things that he 's still working on and trying to improve on . '' Ironically enough , it 's Bartell who has helped the rookie . `` He 's like a great uncle to me , '' Slay said . `` He taught me a lot scheme-wise -- what comes with this route , what comes with this release . He 's helped me a lot . '' That growth appears to have elevated Slay onto the first unit for Detroit 's third preseason game -- often the most important exhibition , as lineups are set heading into the mostly meaningless fourth game . In other words : Starting Thursday would be a giant step toward beating out Bartell for the starting gig Week 1 against the Minnesota Vikings . And that 's quickly becoming the expectation around Allen Park . `` What I 'm going to do is continue to do what I 'm doin ' , and continue to get better , '' Slay said of the battle . `` I 've always been comfortable . I 'm always confident in what I do and who I 'm going against ( in job battles ) . `` I ai n't never had any worries competin ' with nobody . ''

The best part of waking up ? Your coffee cup could have something other than Folgers in it , thanks to one Tacoma company .
Green Cup Coffee Company is combining the wake-me-up punch of coffee with the calm high of marijuana , reports the Seattle Weekly .
“ Medicated ” coffee beans , infused with whole-plant cannabis oil , look like any other coffee bean . But owner Justin Prince says “ you will definitely feel ( the difference ) . ”
Prince is looking to sell their beans in states that allow medical-marijuana , and they want to launch nationally by the time Hempfest in Seattle rolls around in August .
From the Weekly story :
“ We are looking to get our regular coffee into espresso stands and coffee houses everywhere as word gets out , ” Prince said . “ We are going to be expanding into Canada shortly as well. ” Green Cup Coffee is already available at several medical-marijuana dispensaries locally…

Claiming to own X quantity of gold is one thing , and reporting how many times the gold has been pledged as collateral is another .
When correspondent Scott A. Batten offered to write an explanation of the rehypothecation of gold and why it matters , I quickly accepted . Like many others , I have breezed over the word rehypothecation with the basic understanding that it means assets pledged by counterparties ( such as the infamous copper stored in Chinese warehouses ) are reused as collateral/repledged -- in effect , the same assets are pledged as collateral multiple times .
But beyond this , I have not had a clear understanding of how the rehypothecation of gold reserves threatens the whole shaky edifice of Infinite Greed , oops , I mean neoliberal capital markets .
Here is Scott 's commentary :
When introducing a new concept , it is best to start with the definition of the words to be used . In this case , the discussion of rehypothecation and how it places the world at risk with the fun and games played in the stock market .
Rehypothecation :
Rehypothecation occurs when your broker , to whom you have hypothecated -- or pledged -- securities as collateral for a margin loan , pledges those same securities to a bank or other lender to secure a loan to cover the firm 's exposure to potential margin account losses .
When you open a margin account , you typically sign a general account agreement with your broker , in which you authorize your broker to rehypothecate .
Now , let 's put this into easy to understand language . Let 's say that you have ten dollars . You take it to the bank to let them “ borrow ” it , while paying you interest . What you have done , in reality , is given them your money to use as they see fit , while giving you a small percentage of the gains that they will earn . A bank would loan the money to a home buyer or perhaps a small business . At the very least , they can lend all the money in excess of their requirement to hold some cash as reserves -- say 10 % for ease of math .
They now have nine dollars to invest . Their last resort is to offer it to another bank for that bank to “ hold ” , because that bank does n't have enough money to meet its required reserves . Seems simple enough , right ?
Welcome to the games bankers play to make money . Now that this simple format is in place , let 's move to where the serious dangers lie .
Precious Metals :
During World War II , many foreign countries feared that their gold reserves , which at the time backed their paper money , might be taken by an enemy and in 1939 , the good old USA was a very neutral country , like Switzerland , only there was a much better deterrent than the Alps -- the Atlantic Ocean . So , many countries -- England , France , and others -- sent us their gold bars to be stored alongside ours in Fort Knox . Later , after the war was over , we convinced them that it was fine to leave it there and in fact , with the Cold War starting other countries joined in , including Germany .
Now , what good is a pile of gold sitting in a fort going to do ? It costs a lot to protect it , and the US was paying a small sum in interest , while getting a smaller sum back in “ protection fees ” . So , the Federal Reserve had a wonderful idea , at least in their minds .
Since we have this gold , let 's issue paper on that gold as though it was ours , after all it is sitting in Fort Knox , and earn a bit of money on the side . So long as the Cold War lasted , the gold certainly was n't going anywhere . Here is where the trouble began . It was pretty small potatoes for a good while , until we went off the gold standard in 1971 during the Nixon Administration . What good is having a precious metal to back fiat currency , when a promise is just as good ? Enter the danger zone .
Now , the gold in Fort Knox is n't doing anything . So , what to do ? Well , each bar of gold has a unique mark on it to say who owns it . The Cold War is still raging , so no one is going to ask for it back anytime soon . Let 's melt down some of that gold , just a small percentage of it , and sell it off as bullion . Gold is high and the foreign countries wo n't ask for it all , so let 's skim a bit here and there . No one will know , and we can make money .
Then debts started to accrue , so they got brazen and started melting bars and reselling bars as their own gold , because they do n't want to use their own gold , when German gold is just the same , except for that little mark . Erase the mark and put your own on it and sell it as yours , using your gold as the “ backer ” in case Germany asks for some of it back .
Well , it was n't long until greed set in . Those gold bars that were sold to say , China or Japan , were resold to Austria or Iraq . Much like the bundling and reselling of home loans in the 1990 's , soon the German melted gold was in seven different countries with seven different marks , but no German mark upon them remained . This still was n't the breaking point though , after all there is still plenty of Gold in Fort Knox to cover what is owed to them .
I do n't know who 's idea it was , but it was a bad idea . They decided that they could sell paper promises of gold being held in the vaults . The last number I saw was 140 % . Which means that if they have 100 pounds of gold , they can sell paper as though they have 140 pounds of gold . Now , they can also sell that gold outright as well . So , it 's possible that they could sell 140 pounds of paper gold and sell a portion of the physical gold . too .
Confused yet ? Here is where we stand today . No one knows how much gold is really in Fort Knox . We only know what they say is in Fort Knox . The same is likely true for the Federal Reserve and possibly the major banks ; after all , if the Fed starts demanding to know what 's in those banks , they might have to show theirs too . So , let 's say that the economy starts to really go south around the world . As you know from the news , Germany asked to see their gold at Fort Knox and were denied , so they asked for their gold back . Smart move on Germany 's part in my mind . Answer from the Fed , we will get it to you sometime in the near future . This was n't challenged by Germany .
Why ? Rehypothecation . Germany knows that they have been doing the same thing with gold that we have . It 's been sold to multiple people at the same time , under the theory that not everyone will want it at the same time , so we can just move it around as needed .
This game of musical golden chairs works fine , until the musical economy stops . When countries start to rack up debt and desire to sell their own gold to pay the bill , and they ca n't get it , they get nervous . Now , if the economy is going south and the price of gold is heading up because of fear , those people holding paper gold in the form of futures or just deposit promises begin to sell off for profit or out of financial need . So long as it 's a trickle , no problem , but if it becomes a torrent ....
Remember the 140 % rule ? Well , what if the Federal Reserve only kept 60 % of the 100 % that the paper gold was written on ? Now there is an 80 % shortage . Someone is about to have their musical golden chair pulled out from under them . They will get paid , BUT that payment will come as fiat currency . As the golden parachute deflates , how good is fiat currency ? This is why there are so many on the fringe demanding to see the gold reserves and others are saying gold will hit $ 5,000 an ounce or higher . It is theoretically possible that for each gold promise , that it is backed by 1/5 or less of physical gold . No one knows , because no one can audit the physical gold .
China is getting ready to release their gold reserves . That is , they will do like the Fed and say how much they have . We can not call them on their real reserves , because then they can do the same to us . Now , if all the gold is still in Fort Knox and the Federal Reserve , then the US can call for a real accounting and show ours as well .
However , if we do n't and China does , and calls for the US to do the same , then a lot of fear enters the market . There is a reason that people say `` never own paper metals . '' This is that reason . You might get the value of that gold , but it will be in fiat currency and if things are crumbling then fiat promises become flat losses .
Thank you , Scott , for the explanation . It 's a funny thing about financial games ; whatever the Mainstream Financial Media mocks as conspiracy theories often later turn out to be accurate .
I do not claim any expertise in the gold/paper gold markets , but it 's clear that claiming to own X quantity of gold is one thing , and reporting how many times the gold has been pledged as collateral is another . In a transparent financial system , the citizens of the U.S. would be invited to tour Fort Knox ( in small , secure groups , of course ) and count the nation 's gold directly . What 's the harm in showing off the gold to anyone willing to go through security ?
Why keep the nation 's gold reserves so mysteriously secret ? What 's the point in being so cagey about it ? Maybe rehypothecation is n't the reason for the secrecy ; then what is ? Fear of precisely what ? Is n't gold supposed to be a foolish relic ? What 's the danger in letting people look at the foolish relic and count the bars and note the serial numbers on the bars ? What 's the risk in that ?
I propose turning Fort Knox into a profitable tourist attraction . If gold is just a foolish relic , then charge $ 50 a person to wander around `` our '' gold . It 's not like anyone can slip a heavy bar into their purse or pocket without being detected . Put it behind bulletproof glass if you want . What 's the risk ?
Get a Job , Build a Real Career and Defy a Bewildering Economy
Are you like me ? Ever since my first summer job decades ago , I 've been chasing financial security . Not win-the-lottery , Bill Gates riches ( although it would be nice ! ) , but simply a feeling of financial control . I want my financial worries to if not disappear at least be manageable and comprehensible .
A ban of grappling events in Montreal surprised everyone in the community earlier this year . Now Tristar head coach Firas Zahabi is offering up an explanation as to what happened as well as a workaround on the current ban .

U.S. military spokespersons defend the use of defoliants in Vietnam at a news conference in Saigon , claiming that the use of the agents in selected areas of South Vietnam had neither appreciably altered the country 's ecology , nor produced any harmful effects on human or animal life .
However , a paper released at the same news conference by Dr. Fred T. Shirley , a U.S. Agriculture Department expert , suggested that U.S. officials in Saigon were underestimating the extent of ecological damage caused in Vietnam by defoliating agents and that they had caused “ undeniable ecological damage ” and that “ recovery may take a long time. ” Defoliation had been used in Vietnam since 1961 to reduce the dense jungle foliage so communist forces could not use it for cover , as well as to deny the enemy use of crops needed for subsistence . During a nine-year period ending in 1971 , over 19 million gallons of three major herbicides ( Agents Orange , White , and Blue ) would be used in Vietnam . As part of Operation Ranch Hand , conducted from 1962 to 1970 , specially equipped C-123 aircraft sprayed these herbicides in a 300-foot swath about eight and half miles long . It was also applied by helicopter , truck , and hand sprayers . The heaviest use of the defoliants was in the III Corps Tactical Zone north of Saigon and along the Cambodian and Laotian borders . The use of these agents was controversial , both during and after the war , because of the questions about long-term ecological impacts and the effect on humans who were either sprayed or handled the chemicals . Beginning in the late 1970s , Vietnam veterans began to cite the herbicides , especially Agent Orange , as the cause of health problems ranging from skin rashes to cancer and birth defects in their children . Similar problems , including an abnormally high incidence of miscarriages and congenital malformations , have been reported among the Vietnamese people who lived in the areas where to defoliate agents were used .

Despite recent Republican controversies , the Democrat Party took more of hit in its favorability rating than the GOP did .
( CNSNews.com ) – Neither the Democrat Party nor the Republican Party are popular with Americans , but a new Gallup Poll indicates that the rating for Democrats has slipped five points since November , while the low rating for the Republican Party remained about the same .
The May 3-7 Gallup poll asked Americans whether they have a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of each party .
Forty percent of Americans said they view Democratic Party favorably , down from 45 percent in November . The Republican rating dropped one point , to 39 percent this month from 40 percent in November .
The decline in Democratic Party favorability is mostly a result of lower ratings from self-identified Democrats , Gallup said . And both parties ' ratings are below their historical norms .
Gallup notes that historically , Democrats ' ratings usually exceed Republicans ' ratings -- by six percentage points , on average .
The implications , according to Gallup :
Americans are quite negative toward both of the major political parties at this time . Trump 's unpopularity and the GOP 's challenges in governing a divided nation have done little to weaken the party 's poor image further . But those same factors have also done little to cast the opposing party , the Democrats , in a more favorable light . If anything , the Democratic Party 's positioning appears weakened , largely because its own supporters now hold a less positive view of the party . That could indicate Democrats are frustrated with the party 's minority status in Washington .
Not since 2003 through 2006 have Democrats failed to control the presidency , House of Representatives or Senate . Prior to that , Democrats had control of either Congress or the presidency for more than 50 years . Next year Democrats will have a chance to change their minority party status in the federal midterm elections . Midterm elections are often a referendum on the president , so Democrats ' prospects for a strong showing are enhanced by Trump 's low approval ratings . However , if Democrats can not improve their party 's image between now and November 2018 , it may hinder their ability to regain some measure of power in Washington .
The Gallup poll is based on telephone interviews conducted May 3-7 , 2017 , with a random sample of 1,011 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia . The margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level .
I really ca n't express enough how thoughtful and great this gift was .
I loved every part of it , and everyone in the house got something . My godson , who is a very special part of my life , was included and given the cutest Lego set .
The hounds received wonderful treats and toys ( 2 out of 3 dogs immediately played with the toys ) . The husband was given a small handmade crossbow . And among all the fun treats and many small gifts , I was gifted a beautiful carving tool set that I ca n't wait to use , and two beautiful Japanese fans that will be hung in my studio .
The detail and time that went into making this gift special is really what these exchanges are all about . AbsolutelyPink ( and their son ) , deserves many upvotes and all the awards available .
Thank you ! !
What had seemed like a sleepy election season in New Orleans jolted awake Friday afternoon , when a rush of 19 candidates filed to run for offices up and down the ballot .
The three-day qualifying period ended with a total of 18 candidates vying for the city 's top job , and with only one local official re-elected automatically without opposition . And , save for a head-to-head match-up between the current councilwoman and their predecessor in District C , every City Council race drew at least four candidates .
In all , 66 candidates qualified for 15 offices in New Orleans . Only one incumbent , Clerk of Civil District Court Dale Atkins , was re-elected without opposition .
The end of qualifying also brought closure to months of speculation over whether Sidney Torres IV would jump in and shake up the race for mayor . The business person and reality-TV host announced they would stand down .
And if that were n't enough excitement for one day of New Orleans politics , term-limited Councilwoman Stacy Head took to the steps of the Criminal District Courthouse as qualifying was wrapping up inside to call on voters to “ reject platitudes ” from candidates and warn of rumors that pay-to-play schemes were already taking hold in the election .
Things were less crowded on the north shore , where special elections drew 13 candidates seeking to fill four seats , and in Jefferson Parish , which will feature a likely hotly contested two-person race for a spot on the Parish Council . On Grand Isle , the widow of a former Town Council member was elected without opposition to fill their husband 's seat .
With the close of qualifying , the stage is now set for a three-month dash to the Oct. 14 primary — to be followed by runoffs on Nov. 18 where necessary .
It remains to be seen how many of the candidates are prepared to mount serious campaigns , though the new entrants include at least a handful of people with prior political experience .
By far the most action Friday came in the New Orleans ' mayor 's race . Eleven new candidates filed to replace Mayor Mitch Landrieu , who is term-limited , more than doubling the size of the field . Among the seven entrants who had already filed are the well-established campaigns of former Civil District Court Judge Michael Bagneris , City Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell and former Municipal Court Judge Desiree Charbonnet .
Ca n't see the video below ? Click here .
The last-day entrants include business person Frank Scurlock , who has been campaigning in a top hat and colorful suits while fighting a Municipal Court assault charge stemming from an incident in which they followed and shouted at a New Orleans police officer during a protest at the since-removed Jefferson Davis monument .
A pair of familiar names also entered the field Friday : consultant Troy Henry , who is making their second bid for the city 's top job , and Tommie Vassel , a certified public accountant who has served on the Sewerage & Water Board and previously sought a seat on the City Council .
The field also now includes a variety of colorful candidates , including perennial campaigner Manny “ Chevrolet ” Bruno and Patrick Van Hoorebeek , the owner of Patrick 's Bar Vin in the French Quarter , who showed up in a bright red suit to qualify .
The last-minute flood of candidates was as notable for whom it did n't contain as for whom it did . Torres , who has been floating the idea of a mayoral run since last year , announced Friday on Facebook that they had decided against a campaign . However , they said they would keep a hand in the city 's electoral politics through a new political action committee .
Ca n't see the video below ? Click here .
The city has n't seen a mayoral field this crowded since 2006 , when 23 candidates sought unsuccessfully to oust Mayor Ray Nagin , who was seeking a second term . But only four of those candidates got more than 10,000 votes , and Nagin would go on to beat Landrieu , then the lieutenant governor , in a runoff .
The last day of qualifying also filled out the New Orleans City Council races .
At-large Councilman Jason Williams , who had drawn no opposition until Friday , now faces four opponents . In the other at-large seat , which will be left vacant by Head 's departure , state Rep. Joe Bouie joined a field of three that also includes state Rep. Helena Moreno .
Six hopefuls are running to replace term-limited Councilwoman Susan Guidry in District A , and the same number hope to succeed the departing Cantrell in District B .
And with new entrants in the District D and E races , there are now three candidates running against Councilman Jared Brossett in D and five vying against Councilman James Gray in E in their re-election bids .
The least crowded race may be one of the most intriguing . No new candidates registered to run in District C , leaving it a two-woman contest between incumbent Nadine Ramsey and their predecessor , Kristin Gisleson Palmer . Palmer opted not to run in the 2014 race that Ramsey won .
Outside of the mayoral and City Council races , the field is sparser .
Clerk of Criminal District Court Arthur Morrell , who helps oversee elections in the city , drew a challenge on Friday from Danil Faust , who said they are campaigning on election integrity and security issues .
No new challengers emerged Friday to face Sheriff Marlin Gusman , leaving them in a two-person race against one of their former deputies , Fredrick “ Freddy ” Brooks , who worked at the Sheriff 's Office from 2007 to 2014 .
Ca n't see the video below ? Click here .
In January 2013 , Sheriff 's Office internal investigators said they received a complaint from a Walgreens pharmacy where Brooks worked a paid , off-duty detail . The store 's loss prevention officer said Brooks was paid $ 255 more than they should have gotten by clocking in earlier and later than their actual arrival and departure times . Brooks repaid the money . The Sheriff 's Office docked them 10 days in pay and banned them from detail work for 90 days .
Their position at the Sheriff 's Office slid after that incident , according to personnel records . In June 2014 , they were suspended for 20 days after a dispute with a supervisor in the kitchen facility .
Brooks blamed the Walgreens incident on former high-ranking Sheriff 's Office employee Jerry Ursin , who later pleaded guilty in federal court to off-duty detail fraud .
Brooks said that Ursin and other deputies who came to the Sheriff 's Office from the Police Department `` came with their own agenda and things just did n't go right . So I had to get out of there . ”
Qualifying also came with a bit of unexpected drama Friday .
Head , who is not seeking another office this election , showed up at the courthouse and delivered a speech calling on voters to ask hard questions of the candidates , particularly on a series of their pet issues such as improving sales tax collection , requiring some nonprofits to contribute some money to the city 's coffers , overhauling the city 's pension and civil service system , and fixing up blighted properties .
But they also said they have heard from three people that at least one campaign is telling city contractors that donations of $ 20,000 to $ 25,000 will be required to keep doing business with City Hall . Head would not identify the campaign .

In Jefferson Parish , no surprise candidates jumped into the Parish Council District 4 race , which pits state Sen. Danny Martiny against Kenner Councilman Dominick Impastato in what is expected to be a bruising campaign .
In Grand Isle , Mona Santiny was elected to the Town Council District C seat when they were the only one who qualified to run . Santiny will fill the remaining three years of their husband Clifford `` Dixie '' Santiny 's term . Dixie Santiny died in May .
`` I just want to make this island keep growing and growing , '' Mona Santiny said , adding that they plan to focus on making Grand Isle more attractive to tourists .
In St. Tammany Parish , two races gained candidates on the final day of qualifying .
Independents Marvin Lawson , of Abita Springs , and Clark Taylor , of Covington , joined Republican Joe Freeman and incumbent Republican David Fitzgerald in a special election for the District 2 Parish Council seat .
Charles Wartelle , of Folsom , qualified to face fellow Republicans Jay Adair and Billy Burris for the 22nd Judicial District Court Division E judgeship .
Other races in the parish include a special election for the state House 77th District and a Division H judgeship at the 22nd Judicial District .
Republicans Rob Maness , Mark Wright , Casey Revere and independent Lisa Condrey-Ward qualified for the 77th House District . Republicans Reggie Laurent and Alan Zaunbrecher will compete for the Division H judgeship .

If the owners of bars , clubs or restaurants lack a dance permit and their patrons start moving to music , they can be slapped with a fine in Sweden .
Police have long argued that the permits are needed because dancing creates disorder , which in turn can lead to fights and despite a long campaign against the practice , it seems it is sticking around .
Anders Varveus , a Swedish nightclub pioneer who in 2012 led a 1,000-strong street-dance demo against the regulation , said they were surprised by the outcome of Thursday 's vote and vowed to resuscitate the protest movement .
“ I 'm planning to hold a demo at the Pride Parade on August 1st , ” they told The Local .
To ensure maximum effect , the protest will coincide with the 20th anniversary of the launch of their Docklands club , an iconic venue on the Stockholm club scene .
“ We 'll have about 100 people dancing on our vehicle but we 'll also have a fantastic sound system and I expect around 10,000 people to dance behind us . ”
Varveus said their opposition to the dance permits was threefold .
“ First , it 's a question of personal freedom . How you want to move your own body is not a matter for regulation . ”
Special dance laws were also an antiquated , stodgy way for a state to get involved in the lives of its citizens , they said .
“ Finally , it 's very hard to keep this law functional . What is the definition of dancing ? Once you start moving , how do you know when you 've crossed a line . It 's funny , really . ”
Varveus said they were astonished by which parties had voted for and against the motion .
“ I 'm not surprised the Liberals voted to remove it ; they 're traditionally in favour of more personal freedoms . But I 'm really surprised the conservative , nationalist Sweden Democrats voted to get rid of the permits , along with the Left Party , both of which I 'd consider more ‘ totalitarian ' than the other parties . ”
The Centre Party initially petitioned to remove the permits but in the end did not vote against them . The party argued that the vote had come too early and said it and the other centre-right Alliance parties were preparing a more far-reaching package on general over-regulation for the autumn that would include the dance licences .
Varveus said : “ I do n't understand the logic . ”
Erik Helmerson , a commentator for the Dagens Nyheter newspaper , described the regulation as an “ embarrassing bureaucratic relic ” from the 1970s .
They included in their article a report from a municipal inspector in the town of Gävle last year , who wrote after a visit to a restaurant :
“ The area was populated by 50 to 80 people who moved with the rhythm of the music in a manner akin to dancing . ”
Helmerson added : “ The way we view dancing says a lot about a society . In Sweden restaurateurs are punished with fines and lose their licence to serve alcohol if people like the music being played and move to it without permission .
“ The question we should ask is whether there is too much or too little dancing . And whether politicians are really the right ones to decide . ”

I live a strange life - due to a funny life situation , I travel regularly between India and the US . One of the starkest differences is observing how many jobs machines have taken in the wealthy US , leaving the US with a dire surplus of labor .
A day in the life of Prashant from Gurgaon
Introducing Prashant , a software architect . Prashant wakes up early , heads to a nearby gym , and works out with their personal trainer . After they get back from the gym their wife and family are awake . They all eat a light breakfast prepared by their cook . Prashant lives in Gurgaon , but works in Pitampura - 1.5 hours away . They do n't want to lose productivity so they tether their laptop to their phone and updates JIRA tickets while their driver worries about the road .
Prashant 's wife Aishwarya is also a working professional , so they drop their children off at the creche ( Hinglish word for day care ) where they store their children while not in use . After getting home from work , Prashant and Aishwarya are tired and do n't want to cook . So as usual they eat the food their cook prepared - tonight it 's a spicy paneer chili . After dinner they take a walk . Prashant develops a craving for paan - a delightful contrast to the oily and spicy paneer chili they ate before . So they stop by one of the local paan-walas working by the side of the road . Aishwarya also stops to buy a single cigarette .
Prashant and Aishwarya then walk home , enjoying their minor indulgences .
A day in the life of Mike from California
Introducing Mike from California , a software salesperson extrordinaire . Like Prashant , Mike also wakes up early , chugs some brotein and then heads to their a crossfit box where starts a set of deadlifts . Suddenly they hear a disembodied voice - `` Do n't bend your back on the deadlift , Mike ! '' The AI critiques their form and guides them through a personalized workout designed to maximize their gainz . After their workout the AI gives them tips on taking a good swelfie .
After their workout they go back home to their kitchen . `` Tea , Earl Grey , Hot '' they say , and with some hissing their kitchen-bot prepares them tea . Mike then takes out their phone , orders an egg white omellete , and a few minutes later the bot has produced it . After eating , Mike heads for the shower while the cleaning bot rapidly scurries out of theirs way .
Mike then takes out their phone and orders an Uber . The self driving Uber shows up and takes them to their office . When they get to the office they notice their coworker Katrina watching their children on the nannycam . They see a baby sleeping in the arms of a large , cuddly furry humanoid shape - Katrina 's friendly NannyBot . It looks like a stuffed toy but the AI inside keeps their children safe .
After heading home , Mike goes out for a run - they like to separate their cardio and strength training . As they are coming back from their run , they stop by one of the many food stalls on the way back . `` Give me 2 fish tacos , less oil '' they ask . They then taps their phone to the terminal to pay . A slightly distorted voice replies to them - `` Si senor , tres minutos . '' Apparently the speakers on the TacoTron need a little adjustment , but three minutes later the bot hands them delicious fish tacos .
Mike then heads home , ready for bed .
Wait what ?
My Indian readers probably see quite a bit of themselves in the story of Prashant . But my American readers probably recognize that the story of Mike from California is pure science fiction . Readers with very sharp eyes might notice that the photo of TacoTron is actually a forgery !
In the US , self driving cars are currently research projects owned by Google and Tesla . Mike ca n't afford an Uber every day so they need to drive themselves to work . There is no kitchen bot , cleaning bot or TacoTron . Katrina , like many professionals was unable to afford child care - in real life they quit work to care for their children herself .
Relative to India , the US has significantly fewer jobs . But machines did n't steal these jobs - these jobs just do n't get done .
This is not really what you 'd expect if there is a surplus of labor . A surplus is a situation where we have so much supply of something that we are simply unable to consume it all . Yet in the real world we find ourselves in a situation where we desperately want more labor to be performed .
Where did the jobs go ?
Lets think about some examples of jobs that get done in India , but do n't get done in the US . It 's easy to imagine that a paan-wala might not get much business in the US - lots of Americans just do n't like paan . But what about the paan-wala 's other line of business , selling single cigarettes ?
In the US , we actually do have a few such people . In 2014 , an American ( alleged ) cigarette wala became quite famous for a little while . Their name was Eric Garner . Unfortunately Eric Garner did n't become famous for doing a great job of selling cigarettes . They became famous because the police choked them to death while they told them 11 times that they could n't breath . ( Warning : that 's a link to a video of police killing a guy for no good reason . You probably do n't want to watch it . )
Perhaps people in the US ca n't find jobs as cigarette walas because they do n't want to be killed .
As an example of another job , consider food vendors . In India there are a huge number of pani puri walas like this one :
They start the night as a guy with food but not money ; they end the night as a guy with money but not food . In some of the more corrupt and westernized areas ( e.g . Bandra ) the police will actually carefully police the vendors and make sure only the approved ones get to work . But that 's a very special case - for my western readers , Bandra is roughly the Bombay equivalent of Beverly Hills .
In the US , the situation is far more fraught . Consider the NYT article Outlaws Make Better Lunches . Apparently all food walas are technically illegal , but if a food wala maintains good relations with assorted politically connected people ( police , nearby brick & mortar competition ) then law might not be enforced . As one might expect , the number of people who are good at cooking is far smaller than the number of people who are good at cooking and crony-style politics . From the article :
... nor can it fully legalize street vending , because opening up hundreds of rent-free spots would damage the real estate economy .
There was a similar motivation behind the lunch truck crackdown in Jersey City back in 2010 and 2011 - lunch trucks were providing quality meals to people and outcompeting the local Au Bon Pain and Burger King . Unsurprisingly the city government did n't support free markets and competition and instead made lunch worse for all the local workers .
Perhaps this is where the jobs went ? Destroyed by protectionism demanded by politically powerful actors , namely the `` real estate economy '' ?
When one starts looking for jobs destroyed by protectionist regulations , it 's not very hard to find them . Until last year , to become a hair braider in Texas one would need to engage in 2250 hours of training , pass four exams , and spend thousands of dollars . As one would expect , this results in fewer jobs for people , higher prices , and women with less carefully maintained hair . The situation in Texas has gotten better since Isis Brantley was willing to get arrested repeatedly while standing up for their economic rights ; most other sectors of the economy wo n't have someone with similar courage .
Quite a bit of research has been done and the scientific consensus is quite clear : occupational licensing harms consumers and costs jobs .
It 's also worth thinking about the supply side . In India , there is a lot of domestic labor performed which could , in principle , also occur in the US . Think maids , butlers , drivers , and the like . Why does n't it ? Lets consider the incentives of a person to take such a job . In the US , we have a strong economic `` safety net '' which provides tremendous disincentives for work .
In the `` poverty '' regime of approximately $ 0- $ 15k/year ( I put `` poverty '' in scare quotes because in India this would be considered `` rich '' ) , there is virtually no incentive to increase one 's earnings . There are in fact sharp cliffs where earning $ 1 more can actually cause your disposable income to go down . In terms of consumption you see even starker effects . See also this CBO report . In short , if a person could earn $ 15k-20k/year as a maid , they have no incentive whatsoever to actually take this job ; they can also have $ 15-20k/year of consumption by taking advantage of the safety net and they do n't even have to work .
India also has a safety net - the Rural Employment Guarantee Act . But India 's safety net is structured quite differently - it 's along the lines of the Basic Job Guarantee I proposed in an earlier post , or the Civilian Conservation Corp that the notoriously right wing FDR enacted . It 's structured roughly as follows ; if someone ca n't find work , the government will provide them low wage labor ( typically 120-200 rupees/day ) . So in India your choices are either work for the government for a very low wage or work for an individual at a moderately higher wage . As simple incentives would predict , when increased labor increases your income , more people are willing to offer labor in the market .
The idea that robots have somehow taken our jobs and we have a surplus of labor is nonsense . A surplus is when you have too much of something . In the US , we have a situation of too little labor ; houses are dirty because maids are expensive , professional women quit the workforce because they ca n't afford child care , and high skill individuals spend lots of time on household labor they do n't enjoy . Robots did n't take our jobs .
As a corollary of this argument , the Chinese and Mexicans ( or whoever protectionists like Trump and Bernie are complaining about today ) also did n't take our jobs .

In around 300 years time , 75 % of all mammal species will have disappeared from this planet . That 's the startling prediction from Anthony Barnosky , a palaeobiologist at the University of California , Berkeley – that 's if the current rates of extinction continue and the animals already threatened or endangered are wiped out this century .
Barnosky studies biodiversity changes and extinction rates that occurred in the deep past , and compares them to trends happening now . Since life first evolved billions of years ago and flourished , diversified , and made our planet what it is , there have been five mass extinctions . Each was triggered by a cataclysmic event and resulted in at least 75 % of all species going extinct . The last of these events occurred 65 million years ago , when a meteorite slammed into Earth , throwing up persistent clouds of debris that darkened the sky for years . The resulting change in climate led to a mass extinction that included the dinosaurs .
Barnosky calculates that humans are now creating a mass extinction on the same scale – the planet 's sixth one – through a combination of habitat encroachment and fragmentation , hunting , climate change , pollution , and the spread of disease and introduced species . As many as 30 % of all species may be lost over the next four decades , conservationists estimate .
Extinction is actually a natural and common phenomenon – of the roughly 4 billion species estimated to have evolved on Earth , some 99 % are gone . In the past , the extinction rate has been balanced by the evolution of new species , but the current , human-caused extinction is happening so fast that evolution can not keep pace . Barnosky estimates that the current rate is 1,000 times the natural rate , putting it easily on a par with the so-called “ big 5 ” mass extinction events .
The Anthropocene , or Age of Man , will be marked by a rapid decline in biodiversity as animals and plants disappear from the planet forever . It wo n't just be the individual creatures that vanish , but also their descendants on the evolutionary tree – whole lines of phyla will prematurely cease .
And the Anthropocene will also be notable for its homogeneity – what Barnosky describes as the `` McDonaldization of nature '' . Many animals and plants have evolved to occupy specific geographical niches , such as islands or mountain lakes . As a result , it 's possible to find some endemic species that exist nowhere else on Earth , such as the giant tortoises of the Galapagos , the lemurs of Madagascar or the koalas of Australia .
Occasionally , during Earth 's history , shifting tectonic plates have forced land masses together , enabling the separated biodiversity to mix for the first time . This happened when the North and South American continents collided into each other , around 3 million years ago , for example . In the invasions that followed , South America got its first large carnivore – the jaguar from North America – which proceeded to eat much of the native fauna , resulting in the loss of many species .
Dominant force
Humans have been orchestrating tectonic-scale species migrations of their own , either deliberately or accidentally , which has left its mark on the living planet . Some species including rats , goats , rhododendron , wheat and eucalyptus are found around the world while many others have become rare or vanished . Many introduced species are invasive – or “ weeds ” – which out-compete the natives for food , light and habitat , or like the jaguar simply consume them to extinction .
We 've also been spreading pests and diseases from place to place , often causing local extinctions . Isolated human populations have even been wiped out in this way , when we 've introduced diseases such as flu , smallpox , HIV or malaria to places where the local people have n't developed adequate immunity .
Meanwhile , we 've been artificially boosting the populations of certain select species , such as cows , dogs , rice , maize and chickens – most of which have been bred to create new varieties radically different from their wild ancestors . The combined weight of humans and the animals we 've domesticated now outweighs all the wild back-boned creatures on the planet 's surface by a ratio of 95 to 5 , Barnosky says . Ten thousand years ago , at the beginning of the Holocene geological epoch , the weight of humans and domesticated animals was just 0.1 % of the total .
Since we have become such a dominant force on our planet , we have to decide how best to manage the situation we 're creating . Many are calling for a change in the way that conservation has traditionally been practiced . Instead of battling to return ecosystems to a pre-human state , as previous efforts have tried to do , some conservationists say we should be realistic and recognise that humans are an integral part of many ecosystems now . In many cases , they argue , we should accept ecosystems that incorporate non-native species , value them and try to conserve them as “ novel ecosystems ” that are worth protecting .
Tipping point
From Hawaii to the Galapagos , conservationists are beginning to accept and implement this new approach - embracing introduced species , while trying to route out the more harmful invasives that out-compete unique flora or fauna . In the Galapagos , plagues of blackberry bushes originally from the Himalayas are simply being controlled , whereas rats and goats that eat the food of rare tortoises are being eliminated .
In other places , such as the vast monocultures we create through agriculture , efforts are already being made to restore native ecosystems , or in some cases plant non-native trees and grasses , or introduce animals to restore the functions that the pre-human ecosystem once provided – such as reducing soil erosion , pollinating flowers or controlling wildfires .
There have never been so many areas of conservation – national parks and protected zones – so you could argue that humans may be acting in time to save endangered species from extinction . But many of these areas are protected in name only – the parts of the world with the greatest biodiversity are often in the poorest and most troubled regions , such as the Congo and Borneo .
It is fairly certain that the Anthropocene will be a time of much poorer biodiversity . Once-common species will be extinct , or exist only in human-made environments like zoos or private breeding colonies far from their natural habitat , such as the lemur sanctuary in the Caribbean that Virgin boss Richard Branson proposed last year .
Paradoxically , just as we approach a tipping point for extinctions , we are beginning to understand how we could bring extinct animals back from the dead . Scientists are hopeful of cloning mammoths and even restoring our own extinct cousin , the Neanderthal . Sadly , expensive techniques like this , even if successful for individual animals , could not be applied practically to restore the intricate diversity of life that existed before humans took over the planet . Instead , in our human world , we must decide what type of ecosystems we would collectively like , and set about creating and protecting them . In the Anthropocene , we are no longer just another part of the natural world , we are the planet 's gardeners . And that means we must develop our nurturing skills .

It 's almost unanimous : Pac-10 coaches support the rumored candidacy of USC coach Pete Carroll for the San Diego Chargers ' head coaching vacancy .
`` There 's not a better candidate out there , and we 'd be delighted to see them get the opportunity they so richly deserves , '' said a buoyant Mike Bellotti , coach of conference rival Oregon . `` He 's got the experience , the talent , and the perspective of someone who 's been in the league before but understands its limitations . ''
Mike Bellotti : so happy about the potential of Carroll 's departure , they might grow their winning mustache back . Happy Mustache Wednesday , motherfuckers .
Bellotti 's teams are 1-5 against Carroll 's teams , and have been outscored in those games by a margin of 146-80 .
`` He might want to hurry up , though , '' said the Ducks coach . `` They 're just signing them younger and younger in the NFL these days at the coaching level . Time waits for no man , not even Pete . ''
Bellotti smiled , then paused . `` But we 'd miss him . Yeah , we 'd miss him . ''
Reaction regarding the expected rumors of Carroll to the Chargers extended across the Pacific Coast . Jeff Tedford , Cal coach , seconded Bellotti 's sentiments in a phone interview early Wednesday . ''
`` Really ? San Diego ? Wow , that would be ... um , a huge loss for the league , sure .
That 's what I 'm saying here , '' said Tedford , whose Cal Bears are a combined 1-5 against Carroll and have been outscored by a margin of 197 to 112 points . `` He 'd have the great setup of a weak AFC West and a stadium not built on a fucking fault line . Sounds great to me . Just peachy , actually . ''
Other coaches with shorter track records against Carroll sounded similar endorsements of the move .
-- Ty Willingham , University of Washington head coach : `` He 'll likely get personnel control , which is good . He 'll also not be fired for their blackness , though believe me , Pete 's really in the Bill Clinton mode , a black dude in a white guy 's body . Excuse me , I 've got a wicked lie to deal with here and ca n't find my pitching wedge . Good day . ''
-- Mike Stoops , Arizona head coach : `` He stole my recruits . I also think they stole the flat screens out of my Tahoe . Fuck that guy in the ear . ''
-- Dennis Erickson , who has never faced Carroll but is taking over the football program at Arizona State : `` Carroll ? Are they still coaching the Jets ? Bully for them getting the San Antonio job . He 'll do a great job , I 'm sure , especially if that David Robinson guy 's still around and they can get Avery Johnson at point guard . I 'll raise a glass to them at dinner . Or lunch . It all depends , really . ''
-- Karl Dorrell , UCLA coach , commenting from their office , tastefully attired in an eggshell sweater with grey pants and dining on a lunch of oatmeal and unsalted egg whites : `` I 'm unsure how to react here . I 'm happy , but also sad . Call me in the middle on this one . '' Dorrell also commented on the weather outside , which was 73 degrees , partly cloudy , and neither hot nor cold .
Dorrell : feeling equivocal about the whole thing , really .
One Pac-10 coach , Mike Riley , differed from their peers .
`` I want Pete Carroll to know that the Beavers are ready to envelop their Trojans and take them to the breaking point each and every year , '' said Riley via phone on Tuesday night . `` We 'll ride them 'till they snap . Print every word of that , bucko . ''
Current Stanford coach Tree had no comment as of Wednesday at noon .
Stanford football coach : no comment .
WSOF middleweight champion David Branch ( 14-3 ) will make their first title defense in a fight against onetime UFC title challenger Yushin Okami ( 30-8 ) , the promotion announced today .
During a media teleconference in support of WSOF 12 , which takes place Saturday at Las Vegas ' Hard Rock Hotel and Casino , President Ray Sefo said the bout will take place on Oct. 24 .
A WSOF official told MMAjunkie that the date coincides with WSOF 15 , but a city and venue for the event is not yet set . An additional WSOF source said the fight is not expected to be the WSOF 15 main event .
Branch , a UFC vet , won the inaugural WSOF middleweight title with a first-round submission of fellow octagon vet Jesse Taylor at this past month 's WSOF 10 , which also took place at Hard Rock Hotel and Casino . The champ remains undefeated under the WSOF banner with four straight wins .
Okami , however , represents one of the more significant threats in their high-profile career . The Japanese vet debuted for WSOF in March and earned a second-round submission of Svetlozar Savov at WSOF 9 . The win put them back on the right track after a first-round TKO loss to Ronaldo Souza ended a seven-year UFC career in which they went 13-5 in the octagon .
Additional matchups for the Oct. 24 have yet to be announced .

“ Nostalgia ” for a pro-Nazi past , spurning of ethnic minorities and pressure on the press : Croatian activists say an alarming climate of intolerance is taking hold under a new conservative government .
Since the ruling coalition took power in the European Union country in January , critics say authorities have turned a blind eye – and even contributed to – concerns over a far-right right surge .
Last week , in response , angry Jewish , ethnic Serb and anti-fascist groups refused to attend a ceremony remembering tens of thousands who died at Jasenovac , the most notorious concentration camp under Croatia 's pro-Nazi Ustasha regime during World War II .
The boycott was a “ brave and correct decision in the face of the wave of neo-fascist Ustasha nostalgia which is sweeping Croatia ” , said Efraim Zuroff at the Simon Wiesenthal Center , an international Jewish rights organisation .
Although the Ustasha 's so-called Independent State of Croatia was a Nazi puppet state – killing hundreds of thousands of Serbs , Jews , Roma and others – their modern sympathisers see them as the country 's founding fathers .
The downplaying of their atrocities “ has existed for years , but in a different intensity , ” historian Tvrtko Jakovina told AFP .
“ It has now penetrated cabinet ministers and the mainstream media . ”
Among the controversial appointments to the new government was that of Zlatko Hasanbegović , a historian and alleged Ustasha sympathiser , as culture minister .
A new documentary about the Jasenovac death camp , slammed by Jews as an attempt to revise Croatia 's dark past , was praised by Hasanbegović as “ the best way to finally shed light on many controversial parts of Croatia 's history ” .
Fascism and football
Prime Minister Tihomir Orešković was criticised for failing to react at a March football match against Israel when chants of the Ustasha salute “ Za dom spremni ! ” ( “ Ready for the homeland ! ” ) rang out in the stadium .
A day later the government condemned “ symbols of totalitarian regimes ” , without clearly singling out the Ustasha .
“ The state is simply not doing anything… and does not want to ” prevent a far-right revival , said Ognjen Kraus , leader of Croatia 's Jewish community .
Eventually both Orešković and President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović specifically condemned the Ustasha 's crimes , when the US special envoy for Holocaust issues paid a visit earlier this month .
Observers have likened Croatia 's rightward shift to those in other parts of Eastern Europe , namely Hungary led by strongman Viktor Orban and Poland under the conservative Law and Justice party , which swept to power in October .
But while these leaders were decisively elected , Croatia 's main conservative party , the HDZ , failed to win a November election outright and embarked on weeks of horse-trading to cobble together a coalition .
Political scientist Zarko Puhovski suggested the new government , which also lacks a genuine economic programme to boost fragile growth , was using a strong nationalist ideology to “ create an illusion of a political victory ” .
Respect for minority rights was a key condition for Croatia 's entry to the EU in 2013 , but the leader of Croatia 's ethnic Serbs , Milorad Pupovac , has repeatedly warned of an “ atmosphere of intolerance ” .
Milijan Brkić , a top HDZ official , responded last month that Pupovac “ should go where they would not be in danger ” if they felt at risk .
A local television journalist had in January warned citizens of Zagreb , “ notably mothers with children ” , to be careful while walking near a Serb Orthodox church to ensure priests would not kill them .
When a temporary ban was imposed on the channel for hate speech , thousands took the streets in protest — some of them again chanting the Ustasha salute , with no intervention from police .
‘ Weakening secularity '
The government 's press office denied what it said were “ false and politicised ” allegations , telling AFP it had “ strongly condemned ” totalitarian slogans and “ all forms of expression that promote or encourage hate speech and intolerance ” .
But journalists are also worried — particularly after HDZ deputy Zeljko Glasnović described the media as “ the biggest obstacle to a true democracy ” .
Prominent satirical writer Ante Tomić was assaulted in the coastal city of Split last month , in an attack condemned by the European Federation of Journalists .
But the culture minister said the case “ reminds us of the importance of responsibility for words spoken and written in public ” .
The head of Croatia 's agency regulating electronic media also quit last month , citing political pressure .
In the realm of education , Zagreb University students protested after a cooperation agreement was planned between the philosophy faculty — considered a bastion of liberal thought — and the Catholic theological faculty .
The deal , since put on hold , was seen as an attempt to boost the influence of the Church , considered a symbol of national identity and traditionally aligned with the HDZ .
“ It would be a step towards further weakening of secularity in Croatia , ” said Iva , 20 , a sociology student .
“ In many ways , class differences have remained very stable over the last 20 years , ” said Mike Savage , director of the Center for Research on Socio-Cultural Change at the University of Manchester .
Mr. Cameron has done a good makeover job in some ways , starting with himself . Answering to “ Dave ” and wearing jeans and open-necked shirts , Mr. Cameron comes across as modern , sympathetic and approachable .

They support gay and minority rights , changes ( or claims they do ) the diapers of their young children and rides a bicycle around town ( although their limousine was once spotted being driven behind their bicycle , carting their briefcase ) .
At the same time , Mr. Cameron can not overcome the fact that their own background of easy privilege fits the classic Tory stereotype , Mr. Savage said . Among the most obvious issues , Mr. Savage pointed out , are that “ he speaks with a posh accent and comes from the most elite school in the country . ”
That would be Eton , the traditional finishing school for the aristocracy , and the alma mater of most members of Mr. Cameron 's inner circle . Mr. Cameron also went to Oxford , where they ran in rarefied company , enjoying shooting parties at the estates of their rich friends and joining the upper-crust Bullingdon Club , whose members like to put on white tie , get spectacularly drunk and destroy things like the insides of rural pubs .
Mr. Cameron also married well : Samantha , their wife , is the daughter of Sir Reginald Adrian Berkeley Sheffield , Eighth Baronet and a descendant — reportedly in three different ways — of King Charles II ; their stepfather is the Fourth Viscount Astor .
With all this as material , Labour can not resist . Prime Minister Gordon Brown played to easy laughs in Parliament last year when they derided a Tory proposal to reduce estate taxes as having been “ dreamed up on the playing fields of Eton . ”

The satirical magazine Private Eye 's regular cartoon about the Tories is titled “ Dave Snooty and Their Pals. ” The anti-Cameron insult of choice for protesters at a recent Tory conference was “ Eton boy . ”
Mr. Cameron understands that this can be a problem .
“ Look , if the next election is about , you know , ‘ Let 's not have a posh prime minister , ' I mean , I 'm not going to win it , ” they said in a recent television interview .
In the eyes of many Britons , the Tories ' traditional social elitism is tied to another form of elitism — what they perceive as the callous policies of the haves toward the have-nots in the Thatcher era . That was when the Conservative government cut social spending and pursued an anti- Europe , anti- immigration , anti-union agenda .
Photo
Mr. Cameron 's efforts to move past that , too , have been thrown off track by the financial crisis . Reacting to Britain 's deficit last fall by preaching fiscal austerity , the Tories found themselves once more in the position of grim spoilsports eager to cut government programs .
Realizing how poorly that message was received , they have since softened their position about the speed and depth of the cuts ; their indecision contributed to a recent fall in the polls .
Mr. Cameron faces opposition from within , too . Many members of the Conservative Party — “ the nationalistic , right-wing Tories who like singing ‘ Land of Hope and Glory , ' ” as Anthony Seldon , a political commentator who is master of Wellington College , put it — admire its traditional image and its traditional policies , thank you very much .

With the nationalistic United Kingdom Independence Party , not to mention the extremist British National Party nibbling from the right on issues like immigration , minority rights and Europe , Mr. Cameron is walking a fine line between embracing the new and alienating the old , including the old who are proud of their upper-class heritage .
Many old-time Tories are leaving Parliament this year , including the unrepentantly first-class-loving Sir Nicholas . But there are more waiting in the wings . Last year , worried about how an impeccably pedigreed Tory candidate named Annunziata Rees-Mogg would go over with hoi polloi , Mr. Cameron suggested that they might want to campaign under the name “ Nancy Mogg . ”
They refused , although , to be fair , another candidate , the spectacularly named Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax , dutifully “ de-toffed ” themselves by downgrading to “ Richard Drax ” on campaign posters .

Meanwhile , Ms. Rees-Mogg 's brother , Jacob , a banker who is also running for Parliament and who appears to believe they belong to the “ Brideshead Revisited ” era , having once taken their childhood nanny with them on the campaign trail , went on television to denounce Mr. Cameron 's plan to get more women and minorities elected as the triumph of “ potted plants ” over “ intellectually able people . ”
That presented more easy ammunition for Labour .
How can Mr. Cameron counterattack ? Perhaps , said Tony Travers , director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics , they could use the country 's class confusion to their own advantage .
“ If the Tories were a bit more agile , ” they said , “ they could kind of turn it back on Labour and say , ‘ Well , hang on — it 's an equal society where everyone is the same , which means that people of all backgrounds are equal . So why do you care ? ' ”
Taitri Devi ( 30 ) of Siwan in Bihar and Kundali Adhe ( 50 ) of Parbhani district in Maharashtra have a lot in common . Both work as mid-day meal cooks in schools , earn Rs 1,250 a month , and were in Delhi on Saturday to demand higher wages from the Centre .

On the final day of the ‘ Mahapadav ' , a three-day relay dharna of workers at Parliament Street , Devi and Adhe protested for the same cause alongside 4,000-plus workers . From the SBI building to the Jeevan Vihar building sat a sea of people — accredited social health activists ( ASHA ) and anganwadi workers , construction labourers , tea estate employees , chowkidars and mid-day meal cooks .
“ Five hundred of us have come from Siwan to demand better wages . We get Rs 1,250 a month , and that too is delayed . We work from 7 am to 4 pm and should get minimum wage of Rs 18,000 , ” said Sohaila Gupta of the Bihar Rajya Vidyalaya Rasoiya Sang .
Kunti Devi , 30 , chimed in : “ We are made to clean toilets and sweep the school . It 's not part of our job . How do we raise children with Rs 1,250 a month ? We also want four saris a year as uniform . ”
The 12-point charter , prepared by the Central Trade Unions , demands “ enforcement of all basic labour laws without any exception or exemption , and stringent punitive measures for those violating the welfare labour law ” , “ universal social security cover for all workers ” and “ monthly minimum wages of not less than Rs 18,000 with provisions of indexation ” .
MoS for Labour and Employment ( Independent Charge ) Santosh Gangwar told The Sunday Express , “ A lot of these issues are from the past , and some are in process . We do n't have a negative attitude towards them . The solution to every problem is through dialogue . My appeal is that instead of dharna , engage and hold dialogue with the government . ”
Also present at the rally was Kavita Krishnan , secretary of the India Progressive Women 's Association , who said , “ Workers are making a reasonable demand… they should get minimum wage . This protest is a warning to the government . ”
One of the thousands who showed up at the rally was 60-year-old guard Harbhajan Singh from Kapurthala in Punjab , who makes Rs 33 a day . “ I work outside government offices and try and do other odd jobs to support my family of eight . In 2017 , who earns Rs 33 a day ? ” they asked , heading to Gurdwara Bangla Sahib for a meal .
On dirty carpets , vendors sold peanuts , hairbands , bags , jackets and books — from Premchand 's Godan to a Hindi translation of Nikolai Gogol 's The Portrait , from books on Fidel Castro to the works of Balraj Sahni . Men and women queued up outside public toilets , while some thronged food stalls at Jantar Mantar , which otherwise stood quiet , in sharp contrast to Parliament Street .

Also in the crowd were construction worker Ananda Amey ( 52 ) from Kasargod in Kerala , ASHA worker Jharna Sahu ( 43 ) from Dhamtari , Chhattisgarh , and mason Madan Bosumtari ( 50 ) from Kamrup in Assam — all bound by the same demands . Twelve ASHA workers from Delhi 's Madanpur Khadar , 17 from Tilak Nagar and eight from Dwarka also turned up , dressed in pink blazers , some with their children . “ We work endlessly for Rs 1,500 a month . We need to be recognised as government employees and paid accordingly , ” said 38-year-old Urmila Sati .
After a years-long legal battle , the man responsible for hacking the personal accounts of more than 30 celebrities is being punished by the law . Edward Majerczyk organized the phishing scheme that mined nude photos and videos of dozens of famous people , the most high profile of which was Jennifer Lawrence , whose private images were leaked online in 2014 . Today he 's been sentenced to nine months in jail and ordered to pay $ 5,700 in restitution fees , the latter of which will recuperate therapy expenses incurred by one of their undisclosed victims . According to the plea deal , Majerczyk gained access to the accounts by e-mailing victims and asking them for username and password information , as though they were an agent of an internet service provider . As a rationale for their behavior , Majerczyk 's attorney said they are , “ suffering from depression and looked to pornography websites and internet chat rooms in an attempt to fill some of the voids and disappointment they were feeling in their life. ” The Guardian also reports that Majerczyk 's attorney described their client as “ deeply affected ” by the fallout from the scandal , experiencing both panic attacks and anxiety , which is probably something their victims can “ deeply ” relate to .
[ /caption ] On Saturday , very little was known about the mammoth payload a Delta IV Heavy was carrying into space . Launching from Florida 's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , the 70 metre-high rocket blasted into the atmosphere with a mystery satellite known only as the NROL-26 mission . As the acronym suggests , the mission was carrying a National Reconnaissance Office satellite . However , a little after T+7 minutes 40 seconds , shortly after the second stage engines had fired , a media blackout prevented the world from knowing where the payload was going .
Four days on from this secretive rocket launch , what do we know about NROL-26 ?
The Delta IV Heavy is part of Boeing 's Integrated Defense Systems division Delta IV rocket family . This monster of a launch vehicle can deliver 1.9 million pounds of thrust , carrying large payloads to geosynchronous orbit , some 22,300 miles ( 36,000 km ) above the Earth 's surface . The Delta IV was designed with military and commercial payloads in mind .
Watching the video of Saturday 's launch , one cant help but be in awe of this rocket system . The Delta IV Heavy carried out its second fully successful flight on that day ( the Delta IV Heavy first demonstration flight failed to reach the correct orbit in 2004 ) , placing the most expensive ( and most clandestine ) military spacecraft into orbit . Naturally , details are rather sketchy about what the spacecraft actually is and what it is going to do , but some estimates put the total cost of the rocket plus payload at over $ 2 billion , so it is obviously a very important mission .
Once NROL-26 successfully reached its destination ( wherever that may be ) , the satellite was renamed “ USA 202 ” . We can say with some certainty that USA 202 is an advanced spy satellite of some description . According to one source , the intent of USA 202 is to act as the next generation in orbital eavesdropping technology , deploying an antenna possibly as wide as 350 feet .
According to GlobalSecurity.org ( a military think-tank ) , USA 202 could be of an “ Advanced Mentor ” design . Older versions are believed to have been launched by the National Reconnaissance Office and the Central Intelligence Agency under the code name “ MENTOR ” from 1995 to 2003 . These satellites , in geostationary orbits , collect ground-based radio emissions using very large antennae ( some as wide as 100 metres ) . They are also thought to be very big satellites , weighing in at over five tonnes . Like USA 202 , these older satellites are highly classified and there is no official word confirming or denying any of the specifications .
Last weekend 's successful Delta IV Heavy launch will come as a relief to the security services operating the top secret satellite as launches have fallen behind schedule through failures and technical challenges . These spy satellites are critical to the White House and Pentagon , as the information gathered by USA 202 aid military decisions and shape foreign policy . In this case , it is thought Saturday 's Delta IV Heavy launch will enhance the ability to intercept communications from rogue states and terrorist organizations around the planet .
Let 's hope USA 202 remains operational for its designated lifespan , as we know what happens to spy satellites that do n't behave…

Eight years after shying away from the historic nature of their campaign , Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders : ' I fully expect ' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed ' 2016 primary Sanders : 'Damn right ' I 'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes ' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson : Clinton staff are 'biggest a -- holes in American politics ' MORE is putting women at the center of their agenda as they contemplate a second bid to become the nation 's first woman president .
In recent weeks , Clinton has trumpeted equal pay for women in speeches and panel discussions across the country .
ADVERTISEMENT
They have also called for a “ movement ” to help women at work , arguing that women face not only a “ glass ceiling ” but a floor that could collapse underneath them , erasing the gains made to win equality between the sexes .
And this week , they announced a new $ 600 million effort through the Clinton Global Initiative to help disadvantaged girls attend secondary school .
The effort suggests that if they run for president , Clinton has decided to take the opposite tack from 2008 , when top strategists such as Mark Penn suggested they not emphasize the issue during their first White House bid .
In the post-mortem of that campaign , Clinton aides saw the failure to embrace the historic nature of their bid as a fatal mistake that contributed to their loss in the Democratic primary .
Even worse , they witnessed Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaWith low birth rate , America needs future migrants 4 ways Hillary looms over the 2020 race Obama goes viral after sporting black bomber jacket with '44 ' on sleeve at basketball game MORE 's campaign use the fact that voters would be electing the first black president to its advantage , making the electorate feel a part of bringing about a “ change ” movement .
“ The fact that it did n't happen last time is indicative of everything that went wrong , ” said one longtime Hillary ally who worked on the 2008 campaign . “ Now , she 's being more true to herself , doing what she 's always done and always believed . It 's not about Mark Penn writing a policy memo . ”
Internal memos leaked to The Atlantic after the 2008 campaign show Penn wanted to portray Clinton in the mold of Margaret Thatcher , the “ Iron Lady ” and former prime minister of the United Kingdom .
They wanted to cast them as a strong leader regardless of gender , and sought to play down the fact that they were a woman .
Of voters , they wrote in one memo : “ They do not want someone who would be the first mama , especially in this kind of world . But there is a yearning for a kind of tough single parent — someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office .
“ They are open to the first father being a woman , ” they wrote .
Clinton allies argue the strategy came unnaturally to Clinton , who has long championed women and children issues .
“ Hillary Clinton believes that equal opportunity and success for women and girls builds a better future for all , and that 's why they led efforts to study and improve education opportunities for girls so they have a chance for a brighter future , ” said Adrienne Elrod , the communications director for Correct the Record , the pro-Hillary super-PAC .
When it comes to 2016 , there are a number of reasons to think Clinton should embrace running as the possible first woman president if they make another White House bid .
Democrats have spent much of the last eight years solidifying their standing with women voters . Obama benefitted from a gender gap in voting in both of their general election victories , and Democrats was able to keep their Senate majority in 2010 and 2012 in large part because of support from female voters .
“ Democrats are banking , as they did in 2012 , on the gender gap , ” said Katherine Jellison , a professor of history at Ohio University .
They argued that Clinton is seizing on issues that Democrats in general have realized “ are winners for them . ”
“ These women 's issues are great fundraising talking points for Democrats in terms of getting women 's groups and individual women to donate to campaigns , '' Jellison said .
It could also be easier for Clinton to embrace running as the first woman president when they will not be running against someone set to become the first black president . The historic nature of Obama 's run for the White House in 2008 shadowed the entire campaign .
This time around , Republicans say Clinton is simply looking for a base of support with their embrace of women . And they do n't think it will work .
“ The problem is that , while women do feel that there is some inequality that needs to be addressed they are not necessarily a group that feels in need of a `` champion '' in the same way that the black community rallied around President Obama or that the anti-Wall Street crowd has rallied around [ Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth ] Warren , ” said Katie Packer Gage , the former deputy campaign manager on the 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign who now works at Burning Glass Consulting , a political consulting firm that focuses on messaging to women . “ And women have not shown a history of rallying to a candidate based on gender . ”
“ I understand their strategy , ” Packer Gage added . “ And there is n't really an alternative path for them . ”
Jellison , however , says that Clinton undoubtedly realizes that one of the most powerful moments in their 2008 campaign was their concession speech to Obama .
“ Although we were n't able to shatter that highest , hardest glass ceiling this time , thanks to you , it 's got about 18 million cracks in it , ” Clinton said at the time , bringing tears to the eyes of many supporters who gathered at the storied National Building Museum .
Jellison and close Clinton allies predict that the line could resurface in other forms during a 2016 race . Even the super-PAC Ready for Hillary is already running with the cracks in the glass ceiling theme , releasing a logo of sorts ahead of Clinton 's much-anticipated appearance earlier this month in Iowa .
Asked how Clinton would address their historic role this time around , one former aide said , “ I hope the answer is , ‘ directly . '
“ She has to , ” the former aide said . “ Look what they did at the building museum . What was so striking about that was their whole riff . I do n't know how you do n't have a direct , strong message about women going forward after that moment . ”
And Clinton allies argue that embracing women 's issues comes naturally to Clinton .
Tracy Sefl , a senior adviser to Ready for Hillary who worked on the 2008 campaign , said that , “ at every turn Hillary Clinton demonstrates that the advancement of the rights and opportunities for women and girls is central to who they are .
“ This is n't a side issue , this is n't a one-off , ” Sefl said . “ As they say , this is 'our great unfinished business . ' ”

Arsenal are keen to sign Calum Chambers from Southampton this summer but face competition from Manchester United .
The Gunners ' interest is thought to be intensifying amid fears Bacary Sagna will turn down the offer of a two-year contract worth £75,000 a week and leave the club when their present deal expires at the end of the season .
Sagna is demanding a three-year deal but manager Arsene Wenger is reluctant to sanction that for a 31-year-old , especially given their admiration for fellow right-back Chambers , who has been so impressive in their 19 appearances for Southampton this term .
Chambers signed a new four-year contract with the Saints last July but it is believed that an offer in the region of £10million could be enough to land the 19-year-old .
But United , keen to rebuild this summer after a turbulent first season under David Moyes , are also thought to be interested in Chambers , and there could even be a move to bring the player and their Southampton team-mates Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana to Old Trafford in time for next season .

Standard Sport understands that Arsenal are also monitoring Sebastian Jung , the Eintracht Frankfurt defender . Although Eintracht have found life difficult this season — they are 13th in the Bundesliga and have not pulled clear of relegation trouble — Jung , 23 , has been one of their best players and seems certain to leave , regardless of which league they will play in .
Wenger has shown an admiration for German players in recent seasons , bringing Lukas Podolski , Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil to the club , while Serge Gnabry was recruited from Stuttgart as a 15-year-old in the summer of 2010 . Jung was called into the German squad in November 2012 but did not play and they are still waiting for their first cap .
Wenger 's search for a new right-back could have an impact on the future of Carl Jenkinson , who has made 19 appearances this season but has been the clear second choice behind Sagna . Jenkinson is believed to be a target for Newcastle , who would be keen to take the 22-year-old to St James ' Park on a season-long loan deal .
( CNN ) -- It 's a moment familiar to any regular air traveler .
A passenger 's photo shows oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling on Monday 's Continental Flight 128 .
The plane bucks up and down , lurches forward and back , or both . Sometimes overhead bins fly open . The squeamish gasp . Babies cry . Then , usually , it 's all over .
In-flight turbulence is often a mere inconvenience . But it 's also the leading cause of airline passenger injuries that are not associated with a fatal crash , experts say .
And , on rare occasions , it can be deadly .
In the case of Monday 's Continental Flight 128 , an unexpected blast of air led to much more than jangled nerves , bumps and bruises .
Turbulence struck the flight , from Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , to Houston , Texas , unexpectedly , injuring seven passengers badly enough to require hospitalization after the pilot diverted the flight to Miami , Florida .
Police said 26 passengers were injured , four seriously . Learn more about airline turbulence »
Turbulence , according to the Federal Aviation Administration , is caused by a quick change in air movement . Jet streams , air shooting off of mountains , cold or warm weather fronts and thunderstorms can all cause changes in speed or direction .
The rapid shift in gravity force -- or G-force -- can cause a sensation not unlike being whipped around on a roller coaster . Most of the time , discomfort is the worst byproduct .

Passengers thrown about plane 'as if they were dolls ' FAA site : Turbulence - Staying Safe
`` Normally , it 's an inconvenience , '' said Kevin Garrison , a retired Delta Air Lines pilot living in Lexington , Kentucky . `` Very rarely does it hurt passengers , which is odd because a lot of them do n't keep their seat belts on . ''
And wearing seat belts , aviation officials say , is the best way to stay safe .
`` In the event that something happens , '' said Les Dorr , a spokesperson for the FAA , `` that 's the best advice that we or anyone else can give passengers . ''
Since 1980 , three people have been killed in turbulence-related accidents , according to the administration . At least two of those deaths involved passengers who reportedly were not wearing seat belts while the seat-belt sign was on .
There have been 234 turbulence-related accidents since 1980 , and 114 passengers were seriously injured in those accidents , the FAA reported .
Flight attendants have been hurt at a much higher rate . During that same time period , 184 attendants were seriously injured , despite their numbers being far smaller than the number of passengers .
`` The majority of injuries actually happen to flight attendants , '' Dorr said . `` They have to be up performing their tasks , even when the seat-belt light is on . ''
And while pilots are almost always strapped in with seat belts , even they are n't exempt .
`` I 've had a few bloodied heads -- when I hit my head on the overhead when the seat belt was a little loose , '' said Garrison , who flew for Delta for 27 years .
In Monday 's accident , passengers reported they were slammed into the Boeing 767 's ceiling -- some said two or more times -- when the plane dropped rapidly .
`` I saw people being thrown to the roof as if they were dolls , '' Fabio Ottolini , who was returning to Houston with their wife and daughter after visiting family in Brazil , told CNN affiliate KTRK-TV .
Passengers said most of those injured were not wearing seat belts .
Initial reports are that the Monday flight was hit by what 's called clear-air turbulence , or air pockets that hit without warning .
While pilots are always on the lookout for regular turbulence spots -- like mountain ranges and places where weather fronts are converging -- clear-air turbulence can happen anywhere .
`` You ca n't see it ; you ca n't sense it with radar , '' Dorr said . `` The best way to determine if there 's a possibility of clear-air turbulence is to have somebody in front of you that 's already flown through it . ''
Dorr said passenger injury numbers have dropped over the past few years , during an industry-wide effort to increase safety .
No passengers were reported seriously injured in turbulence incidents in 2008 , and five flight attendants -- down from a high of 19 in 2003 -- received serious injuries , according to the FAA .
The Commercial Aviation Safety Team has focused on seat-belt awareness and pushed for better communication systems for reporting turbulence , Dorr said .
All licensed pilots also receive `` upset training , '' which teaches how to deal with extreme turbulence , they said .

Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova assured everybody in their first press conference after returning from the USA that they felt strong enough to complete the year they had left on their contract with the club . And the club , and specifically the president Sandro Rosell , expressed its desire for this to happen and for Tito to stay on as coach for a further season .
However , the club has been preparing a Plan B just in case the worst comes to the worst and the coach is not able to continue . Tito was in New York only a few days ago for a medical check-up and it wo n't be the last that they have to go through as they continue along the road to recovery from their cancer scare .
Their doctors are due to discuss their health with them and confirm whether or not they are in good enough condition to start a new season . For that reason the club 's directors have been in contact with various candidates to take over the team in the worst-case scenario . One example was the call made to Manuel Pellegrini to see if it was true that they were ready to take up an offer at Manchester City , and make it known to them that the job at Barcelona could still be an option .
Barcelona 's intention is to continue with Tito , but the club has to be prepared for all eventualities and that is the reason for the precautionary plans . If Tito is well enough they will remain on the bench next season , but if that is not the case , another coach will need to be found .
Neither Sandro Rosell nor Andoni Zubizarreta want a repeat of the situation from this season where Tito was at one stage managing the club from a distance , while they received treatment , with the help of Jordi Roura . The squad suffered during that period and the proof of that was in the results .
Zubizarreta is planning to meet with Vilanova once competitive action is over for the season , to discuss the issue in more detail . Although it is a delicate situation , Rosell has already been through it once when Tito was in New York , and everybody is confident a solution will be found .
What is clear is that the club needs a coach who is 100 per cent and certain decisions made during matches have caused some concern within the club 's management .

Moments later , they fly into a rage , rips the sign out of their hand and throws it to the ground , then rips the Tea Party flag out of their hand and throws that to the ground .
Have you ever sat back and watched someone who was working up the nerve to do something nasty like shoplift from a store or slash someone 's tire ? They go back and forth , reasoning amongst themselves , until they finally have worked up the courage to carry out the deed . That 's exactly what happened today on Saint George Street in St. Augustine , FL , as I stood there and watched the event unfold .
“ And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech , neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God : I am the LORD. ” Leviticus 18:21 ( KJV )
I was preaching on the street in downtown Saint Augustine back in October of 2016 the day I took this video . The St. Augustine Tea Party was with me , and we were there to be a witness on the streets both for the gospel of Jesus Christ and for our nation . As you will see in this video , the Liberal woman did NOT like being told they were in danger of Hell fire . They then proceeds to attack Bro . Doug and destroy their sign in a crazy , rage-filled outburst .
This woman , obviously a Crooked Hillary supporter , was walking with 3 other friends , when they stopped to watch a meeting of the St. Augustine Tea Party on the street corner . They all stopped and they went back and forth with themselves until they had the nerve to confront – then assault – this member of the Tea Party . I stopped preaching and began to film what happened next .
Pro-Abortion Liberal In Saint Augustine Goes Crazy When Told Killing Babies Is A Sin , Begins Destroying Property
Bro . Doug from the Tea Party asked her : “ Why do you kill babies ? ”
Them immediate response was : “ Because it keeps the crime rate down ” .
Flabbergasted at them answer , they asked them again and they again gave the same response . Moments later , they fly into a rage , rips the sign out of their hand and throws it to the ground , then rips the Tea Party flag out of their hand and throws that to the ground .
Having finished their assault , they storm off in a huff .
Can you imagine the cry and faux Liberal outrage that would have resulted if a Donald Trump supporter had acted like this with a female Crooked Hillary supporter ? It would be headlines on the nightly news for a week and jail time for the Trump supporter .

Are they nuts ? The dysfunction and decadence of tobacco control in one chart
The chart of an audience poll from the Global Tobacco Dependency Treatment Summit 2016 ( 23-24 May 2016 , twitter : # TDTSummit16 ) is deeply disturbing…
Continued cigarette smoking is favoured by two-thirds ( 66 % ) of the audience , rather than using an e-cigarette . Are they nuts ? The question generously even allows e-cigarettes to be a ‘ not ideal ' compromise , but still the majority would rather have people smoking . Who is in the audience ? The summit is…
…bringing together world leaders in tobacco control and treatment , international and national grantees , and health care professionals , to network , share best practices , inspire , and empower participants to build capacity for treating tobacco dependence around the globe
In theory , these are professionals trying to contain the ‘ smoking epidemic ' , but voting to extend it . If evidence was needed that “ tobacco control ” has become a dysfunctional and decadent enterprise on which no more money should be squandered , it is right there on this chart .
Acceptable to whom ? The use of an e-cigarette instead of smoking is a private transaction undertaken by a smoker making a free-choice and executing it with a purchase from a vendor . On what basis does this audience have a locus to declare this transaction acceptable or not ? Any more than they can decide whether what I had for lunch today is acceptable or not . Why are they involved ?
Or then what ? For those audience members who find it ‘ unacceptable ' , now what ? What should they do , given they are not involved directly ? Throw themselves under a bus , consumed by impotent anguish ? No , it 's far worse than that . They will get busy : write misleading articles , give bad advice , make irresponsible statements and petition governments to have their preferences imposed by law over the actual adult parties to this private and personal , health-enhancing decision . That 's the disturbing thing – it 's so illiberal , intrusive and abusive – utterly lacking in empathy , humility or any concern for the people at risk . They will try to stop people stopping smoking , just because they are n't stopping smoking in the way this audience wants . But why… ?
Tobacco Dependence Treatment ? What they were probably trying to say in the poll ( but did n't actually ) is that they think is that other approaches ( i.e . pharma or other medicalised approaches ) would be better than e-cigarettes irrespective of whether the person wants to use that approach , whether these approaches have failed in the past , or even that the smokers concerned may consider that they do n't need ‘ treatment for tobacco dependence ' , they just do n't want cancer if they can avoid it . Maybe this statement , under the summit resources , offers a clue… ?
Since 2012 , SCLC and Pfizer IGLC ( Independent Grants for Learning and Change ) collaborated to award over $ 6.5 million in grants focused on smoking cessation to 54 organizations nationwide . A group of expert reviewers and SCLC volunteered assistance to this grants program and received no financial remuneration from Pfizer . Grant funding for the 54 awardees is provided entirely by Pfizer .
Global Bridges . The other main partner in the summit , with Mayo Clinic , is Global Bridges . It is n't transparent enough to declare its actual funding source on its web pages ( at least that I could find ) but it does mention that it is disbursing Pfizer grants internationally . Update ( via @ JoodiG 's tweet ) – see this 2013 post by Mike Siegel : Mayo Clinic researchers who oppose electronic cigarettes fail to disclose pharmaceutical conflicts of interest in research
Protagonists in the war on nicotine . This does suggest concern over the confusion over goals in tobacco control ( Who or what is the WHO at war with ? ) is a problem that justifies careful examination . Confusion over goals may also be driven deliberately by pharmaceutical companies with interests in psychoactive drugs for tackling ‘ tobacco dependence ' , though this is no longer a reliable proxy for tackling ‘ harm ' . It never was in the case of smokeless tobacco – as we know the Mayo Clinic has form in misleading people about smokeless tobacco , so maybe this really is a deep confusion of objectives that has taken hold on this redoubtable pillar of the medical establishment .
Conflicts of interest . It 's to treat pharma money with just as much caution as tobacco money . We need to start calling out more forcefully those situations where pharma commercial interests have an obvious conflict with pathways that benefit health , and therefore – like the tobacco industry – cause smoking related ill-health . I 'm sure everyone has noticed the volume of anti-vaping propaganda that pours out of the pharma-funded health meetings like the American Thoracic Society annual congress – it would be hard not to . But they keep getting away with it – unchallenged by journalists and , of course , from within the ‘ discipline ' of ‘ public health ' ( the quotes are necessary ) .
Try not to be quite so nuts . To every participant at # TDTSummit16 who did n't vote “ A ” , may I suggest that before returning to work and causing any further harm you should read this paper by two genuinely thoughtful public health experts ( no quotes needed ) , Lynn Kozlowski ( University at Buffalo , SUNY ) and David Abrams ( Truth Initiative ) :
Kozlowski LT , Abrams DB . Obsolete tobacco control themes can be hazardous to public health : the need for updating views on absolute product risks and harm reduction . BMC Public Health 2016 ; 16:432. doi:10.1186/s12889-016-3079-9 Conclusions The last 50 years of tobacco control in the U.S. have regularly engaged issues of absolute risk and harm reduction , but have done so in varying ways ( see Table 1 ) . The recognition that cigarettes were deadly when used as intended and more lethal than a number of other unsafe products combined was influential and important in the progress of tobacco control . In subsequent years , other forms of tobacco use were treated as similar to cigarettes in issues raised [ 42 ] . It is important to make clear distinctions between the classes of tobacco/nicotine products as they differ substantially in risk to the user and to focus tobacco control efforts on reducing the use of cigarettes and other combustible products ( see Fig . 1 ) . Complex models [ 42 , 53 ] should be employed in tobacco control in order to not treat products with large differences in risks as if they are the same [ 31 ] . A new reframing of leading themes can align action plans to more powerfully and rapidly achieve population-level benefit and minimize harm . The goal of updating the framing with a new synthesis of management of all forms of nicotine delivery is to eliminate use of the most appealing , addictive and deadly form of tobacco delivery in our lifetime – the smoking of combustible tobacco products – and thus expeditiously prevent the premature deaths of 1 billion people projected to occur worldwide by 2100 , if the contentious debate is not resolved .
Or at least think about what you just voted for .
While Jason Kander travels the state criticizing Congress for taking a long break after the national nominating conventions , a little bird is always around to irritate him .
Actually , it is a human in a Kansas jayhawk costume , sent by incumbent U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt�s campaign to raise questions about Kander�s oft-repeated statement that they are a fifth-generation Missourian . Kander , a Democrat currently serving as secretary of state , is a former state representative and an officer in the Missouri National Guard .
Kander was born in Kansas , where they grew up and attended high school , but four previous generations of their family called Missouri home , and they do , too , they said Tuesday during a Columbia campaign stop .
�I think Sen. Blunt should be pretty embarrassed that they forced a member of their staff to dress up in an animal costume , � Kander said . �If a politician who has lived in Washington more than half my life believes that a former captain in the Missouri National Guard is not a Missourian , I wish them luck with that argument.�
Kander was joined by about 70 Democrats at Logboat Brewing Co. for their # FixCongress bus tour , planned for 50 stops while Congress is on a seven-week recess . Blunt is vice-chairperson of the Senate Republican Conference and could have objected to the lengthy recess while vital business awaits action , Kander said .
�Instead they choose to throw up their hands and blame somebody else and say that it is about gridlock and excuse himself , � Kander said .
Congress has failed to act on protecting people from the Zika virus , to update a use-of-force resolution to oppose the Islamic State group or to hold a hearing on U.S. Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland , Kander said .
Kander is 35 , and Blunt is 66 . As they introduced Kander , state Rep. Kip Kendrick said they represent �a new generation of leadership� that is �focused on finding solutions to issues that face Missourians and Americans day in and day out.�
Kander is not attending the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia , where former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be nominated for president . When Blunt said they would not attend the GOP convention in Cleveland , Democrats criticized them for ducking out of the event . Kander , at the time , said they would go to Philadelphia .
In a release sent Monday , the Missouri Republican Party criticized Kander for changing their mind and tied them to Clinton .
�Jason Kander and Hillary Clinton are running as a team in Missouri and no last-minute political calculation will change that , � Rich Chrismer , a Republican spokesperson , said in a news release .
Kander said he�s not distancing themselves from Clinton .
�There is only one qualified candidate for president of the United States , and , yes , I campaigned with them the other day in St. Louis , � Kander said .
Does taking a drug and then getting better mean that the drug made you better ? Did that tax cut really stimulate the economy or did it recover on its own ? The problem of answering such questions – of inferring causal relationships from correlations – reaches across the sciences , and beyond .
Normally , correlation by itself does not imply causation . But new research from Perimeter Institute and the Institute for Quantum Computing ( IQC ) has found that in the case of quantum variables , it sometimes can .
The new work , just published in Nature Physics , is the result of a collaboration between Perimeter Faculty member Robert Spekkens , IQC Faculty member Kevin Resch , PhD student Katja Ried , MSc students Megan Agnew and Lydia Vermeyden , and Max Planck Institute senior research scientist Dominik Janzing .
As a practical illustration of the difference between correlation and causation , consider a drug trial : some people take a drug , and some of them get better . Even more promising , the doctors find that among people who took the drug , 60 percent recover ; among people who did n't take the drug , only 40 percent recover . What conclusions can the doctors draw ?
At first blush , it may look as if the drug caused the recovery , but the doctors would need more information before drawing that conclusion . It might be that more men than women chose to take the drug , and more men than women tended to spontaneously recover . In that case , a common cause , gender , could potentially explain the correlation .
This imaginary drug trial shows how tricky it can be to distinguish cause-effect correlations from correlations springing from common causes . That 's why the caution “ correlation does not imply causation ” is drilled into the heads of every researcher for whom statistics is of even passing importance .
Over the last century , scientists , mathematicians , and philosophers have developed a powerful toolkit for untangling webs of cause , effect , and correlation in even the most complex evolving system . The case of systems with only two variables – like the drug trial above – turns out to be the hardest one .
If you want to avoid introducing assumptions about what 's happening , you need to intervene on variable A – in this case , taking the drug . That 's why a real drug trial would be carefully randomized , assigning some people to take the drug and others to take a placebo . Only active intervention on variable A can establish its causal relationship with variable B .
But what of quantum variables ? This new research shows that certain kinds of quantum correlations do imply causation – even without the kind of active intervention that classical variables require .
The new research is both theoretical and experimental . Ried , Spekkens , and Janzing worked from the theoretical end . They considered the situation of an observer who has probed two quantum variables – say , the polarization properties of two photons – and found that they are correlated . The measurement is carried out at two points in time , but the observer does n't know if she 's looking at the same photon twice ( that is , probing a cause-effect relationship ) or looking at a pair of photons in an entangled state ( that is , probing a common cause relationship ) .
The theorists ' crucial insight was that the correlations measured between a photon at one time and the same photon at another time had a different pattern than the correlations measured between two entangled photons . In other words , they discovered that , under the right circumstances , they could tell cause-effect from common cause .
Meanwhile , at the Institute for Quantum Computing , Agnew , Vermeyden , and Resch had the tools to put this remarkable idea to the test . They built an apparatus that could generate two entangled photons , A and B . They measured A , and then sent the pair through a gate that either transmitted photon A , or switched photon A and photon B and transmitted B .
Crucially , this gate could swap between the two scenarios , choosing one or the other based on the output of a random number generator . On the other side of this gate , the researchers conducted another measurement while blind to which photon they measured . Just as the theorists predicted , they saw two distinct patterns of correlation emerge .
This means that researchers measuring quantum variables can do something researchers measuring classical variables can not : tell the difference between cause-effect and common cause in a system with only two variables , without making an active intervention on the first variable .
This discovery has significance for both quantum information and quantum foundations .
The work establishes a new class of things that quantum systems can do which classical systems can not . It 's too early to say how that may play out , but such quantum advantages underpin the promise of quantum technologies : quantum entanglement , for instance , underlies quantum cryptography , and quantum superposition underlies quantum computation .
The discovery of new quantum advantages has historically led to interesting places , and the researchers are hopeful that this new quantum advantage will follow suit .
For those interested in quantum foundations , this work provides a new framework to ask basic questions about quantum mechanics . There is a lively and long-standing debate in the field concerning which quantum concepts are about reality , and which are about our knowledge of reality – for instance , whether the quantum uncertainty about ( say ) the polarization of a photon means that the photon itself has no defined polarization , or if it means that the observer of such a photon has limited knowledge .
Because correlations are about what observers can infer , while causal relations are about the physical relations among systems , this research opens a new window on such questions .
The team describes the work as opening the door to many more lines of inquiry , such as : How can these techniques be generalized to scenarios involving more than two systems ? Is the menu of possible causal relations between quantum systems larger than between classical systems ? And most broadly and excitingly : How should we understand causality in a quantum world ?

In a little bit of a surprise , none of the new releases this weekend were able to make much commotion at the box office . The cynical side of me thinks that it 's because The Great Wall , Fist Fight , and Gore Verbinski ‘ s A Cure for Wellness were all originals and if the movie is n't tied to an existing property , it 's doomed at the box office . And the box office tallies for the three-day total – the four-day total wo n't be in until Tuesday – bear this thinking out , as The LEGO Batman Movie went two for two this weekend , topping the box office with a $ 35 million take .
The Great Wall slid into third place with $ 18 million , as compared to Fifty Shades Darker landing in the second spot with $ 20.8 million . That 's all the more depressing when one considers how remarkably bad Fifty Shades Darker ended up being , especially considering At Close Range helmer James Foley directed the film . In comparison , The Great Wall has some breathless and beautiful sequences , thanks to fight choreographers , set designers , production designers , and director Zhang Yimou of Hero and House of Flying Daggers . The plot of The Great Wall is almost impressively idiotic but for sheer visual dazzle , it was about as good a movie as was available in the big theaters this weekend .
John Wick : Chapter 2 continued to do solid business with $ 16 million , and expectations for a $ 19 million four-day total , which pushes its full box office take over the total gross of the original John Wick in just two weeks . Now that 's a story about a franchise that does n't make you want to gag . Meanwhile , Fist Fight rounded out the top five with an expected $ 14 million four-day total ( three-day total : around $ 12 million ) , which makes the R-rated effort about on par with Ice Cube ‘ s beloved Friday movies . As for A Cure for Wellness , the news is not great , as the movie is now looking at a little over $ 4 million in its opening frame . But then , you remember that Hidden Figures , one of the best dramas of 2016 , only dropped 11 % in its umpteenth frame as compared to the 35 % LEGO Batman dropped in its second frame . So , things are n't necessarily hopeless and cravenly…at least at the box office .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - A Taliban suicide bomber and six gunmen attacked the Afghan parliament on Monday as lawmakers met to consider a new defense minister , and another district in the volatile north fell to the militants as they intensified a summer offensive .

The brazen assault on the symbolic center of power , along with territorial gains elsewhere , highlight how NATO-trained Afghan security forces are struggling to cope with worsening militant violence .
Fighting has spiraled since the departure of most foreign forces from Afghanistan at the end of last year . The insurgents are pushing to take territory more than 13 years after U.S.-led military intervention toppled them from power .
Monday 's attack began as lawmakers met with the new acting defense minister , Masoom Stanikzai . They are the third candidate so far for the key security post , and their appointment must be confirmed by parliament .
A Taliban fighter detonated a car loaded with explosives outside parliament gates , said Ebadullah Karimi , spokesperson for Kabul police , raising questions about how the driver got through several security checkpoints .
Six gunmen took up positions in a building near parliament , they said , but never breached the compound 's gates .
Essa Khan , a soldier inside the parliamentary compound when the attack took place , said they shot dead three militants as they tried to storm inside before killing the rest in a prolonged gunbattle that also involved other troops .
“ Everywhere there was smoke and dust , ” Khan told Reuters .
“ I knew that it was the Taliban from the first moment . I grabbed this gun and shot three of them dead , ” added the 28-year-old , whose actions have played prominently on Afghan media in a rare PR success for the beleaguered armed forces .
Kabul police chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi said all lawmakers were safe . TV pictures showed the speaker sitting calmly and legislators leaving the building , engulfed in dust and smoke , without panicking .
A woman was killed and around 30 civilians were wounded in the attack , according to Rahimi .
They said the assailants were armed with assault rifles and rocket propelled grenades . Some lawmakers ' bodyguards fired sporadically during the attack , hampering the response by Afghan forces , they added .
Police will investigate how the attackers got so close to parliament .
“ We have appointed a delegation to find the weak point or points and report it back to us , ” Rahimi said .
“ BIG FAILURE ”
Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility .
“ We have launched an attack on parliament as there was an important gathering to introduce the country 's defense minister , ” they said by phone , referring to Stanikzai .
Farhad Sediqi was one of several lawmakers who criticized security agencies for not preventing the attack .
“ It shows a big failure in the intelligence and security departments of the government , ” they said .
The attack fits a pattern of high-profile assaults on heavily fortified buildings in the capital . Last month , car bombs targeted the Ministry of Justice , and attackers stormed two guesthouses used by foreigners .
In 2013 the presidential palace was hit , and the U.S. embassy has been attacked several times , notably in 2011 when nine people were killed and 27 wounded in coordinated strikes on the embassy and other targets .
This year , the withdrawal of foreign forces and a reduction in U.S. air strikes have allowed Taliban fighters , who ruled Afghanistan with an iron fist from 1996 to 2001 , to launch several major attacks in important provinces .
A district in the northern province of Kunduz fell to the Taliban on Monday , the second such loss in two days . Officials said the militants were able to take over when urgently needed reinforcements failed to arrive .
The Taliban captured Dasht-e-Archi district a day after hundreds of militants fought their way to the center of the adjacent district of Chardara .
“ The Taliban managed to take it over this morning as the area has been surrounded for days , ” Nasruddin Saeedi , the district governor who escaped to the provincial capital , Kunduz city , told Reuters by telephone .
“ There are many foreign fighters with heavy machine guns . We have asked for reinforcements , but none arrived . ”
Afghan soldiers were preparing a counterattack to retake both districts , another local official said .
Monday 's heavy fighting was just three km ( two miles ) from the provincial governor 's compound .
The rise of the NFL slot receiver
By Neil Hornsby • Jul 4 , 2016
In order to prepare for the 2016 season and test our new data acquisition tool , which allows us to grade games live , we have been analyzing the 2006 NFL season . It is n't complete yet , but we 've seen more than enough games to be reminded just how many things have changed in the last 10 years .
These are all things we 've seen from grading games from 2006 :
True fullbacks playing up to 80 percent of their team 's offensive snaps ( as Lorenzo Neal did for San Diego at Oakland in Week 1 )
Tight ends who can block ( how we miss you Jimmy Kleinsasser )
“ Base ” ( four defensive backs ) still being the predominant defensive package
Far fewer featured wide receivers than there are today .
It 's the last item on that list we 'd like to focus on today , specifically the emergence of a new position the last several years that is only now getting the attention it deserves : the slot receiver .
At PFF , we view it as a different position from a traditional outside wide receiver , and I believe it will continue to differentiate itself as time goes on . Here 's why :
The routes they run are very different , as the above diagram shows . The huge discrepancy in “ go ” routes , among others , leads to an average depth of target that is 3.4 yards lower ( 13.2 for outside receivers versus 9.8 from the slot ) . But that number might obscure what is becoming one of the most difficult jobs in football – defending the two-way go route out of the slot . With no sideline to use to their advantage , the slot corner is vulnerable to a route on either side of where the receiver is lining up .
An upward progression
As passing becomes more and more the tool of choice among NFL offensive coordinators , the growth in both no-huddle offenses and three receiver sets has led to a significant growth in both overall routes run and slot routes .
In 2009 , there were 48,003 WR routes run in the NFL , while last year that number had risen to 54,335 . The percentage of routes runs from the slot is increasing as well , from less than 33 percent in 2009 to nearly 37 percent in 2015 .
The slot leaders
Since we began tracking things in 2007 , here are the wide receivers who have run the most routes from the slot :
It 's perhaps instructive of the rise that Randall Cobb , despite only being drafted in 2011 and not playing over 1,000 snaps in a season until 2014 , is already in 10th position . They play nearly all of their snaps in the slot — of those with over 300 slot routes , they have the fifth-highest percentage with 85.0 .
But who has been the most effective ? Here are the top 10 in terms of yards per route run ( again , among those with over 300 routes run from the slot ) .
This is interesting , because of these players only Victor Cruz and Bobby Engram would be considered true slot receivers . Moreover , these YPRR averages are high , given that they are career numbers and that only 14 players recorded 2.0 overall yards per route run or higher last season .
Perhaps it is a precursor to more top-flight outside receivers getting slot snaps . Moving to the slot helped prolong the careers of both Reggie Wayne and Larry Fitzgerald with far better years than they had previously been enjoying . Just like moving corners to safeties later in their careers ( as with Rod Woodson , Troy Vincent and Charles Woodson ) maybe the slot will become the final home for many exceptional wide-outs .
Either way , do n't be surprised to see this position continue to take on increased importance in today 's pass-happy NFL .
EDMONTON — Legislation banning corporate and union donations to political parties has passed in the Alberta legislature .
It is the flagship first bill of the new NDP government under Premier Rachel Notley .
The bill passed unanimously , including with support of the Progressive Conservatives .
PC Leader Ric McIver had said last week their caucus opposed the bill because it would tilt fundraising in favour of the NDP .
They also said corporations will find ways around the law to continue contributing .
Wildrose leader Brian Jeans said they are pleased that the bill passed , but believes the existing legislation still needs some work .
“ Getting union and corporate donations out of politics is good for democracy , it 's good for Alberta . The NDP even accepted one of our amendments , which shows some progress , ” said Jean . “ But there is still a horrendous loophole in this legislation ; unions can actually pay their employees to volunteer for a political party . We do n't think that 's right . ”
“ We tried to get the NDP government to close that loophole , but they would n't budge , ” they added .
Alberta 's NDP has traditionally gained about 10 per cent of its funding from unions , while the PCs have relied heavily on corporate donations .

The open internet finally got the protection it deserves from profit-hungry cable companies . The FCC just approved the strongest set of net neutrality rules in this country 's history , punctuating a years-long battle for this future of the internet . However , the war 's not yet over .

The new rules largely resemble the open internet rules that Obama laid out three months ago . They forbid paid prioritization—the practice that enables cable companies to create internet `` fast lanes '' —as well as throttling . The new rules do not allow internet service providers to block websites and give the FCC authority to intervene when big cable companies do n't act in the public interest .
In a nutshell , this plan lets the FCC regulate the internet as a public utility , much like telephones . The plan does not give the government the power to set the price of internet service .
This is all fantastic news , and it 's news we 've been waiting years to hear . However , the next battle for the future of the internet will happen in America 's courtrooms and possibly in Congress as well . Several cable companies have already expressed intentions to sue the FCC over the rules , and those cases could drag out for years . These court cases are particularly dangerous . In 2011 , a Verizon lawsuit led to a judge overruling the FCC 's old net neutrality rules .

But for now , these are the rules that internet experts agree are the best way to preserve net neutrality . This is the outcome that America deserves .

Happy Cinco De mayo and Thirsty Thursday ! Today is also Midnight Sun Brewing Company 's 21st anniversary ! Good work brewers ! Now the brewery is finally old enough to drink legally . Today 's Thirsty Thursday entry is all about beer labels . As you may know , I made a label for a Dopplebock brewed at Midnight Sun Brewing a few months ago . That beer will be released very soon , I have been told . When I tell people I 'm the beer artist , they always ask which beer labels I have designed . I have to answer that I have n't done very many yet , and that I am always slacking on time to make good labels for my own home brew . Well , I took the time to make a special label for my latest batch that I am very proud of . This libation is called Stubborn Rainbow Perpetually Hopped IPA . I made this label for dual purposes ; I get a label for my beer , which makes the overall product look better , but I also get to showcase my label design abilities . I worked for three years in a corporate graphic art department in product development , and making these labels reminded me of that time .
I would love to facilitate any requests for custom beer labels . You can commission me to create a custom beer label from an original oil painting . I will work with you to create a custom painting , and will also do the graphics to make a professionally designed label that will make your product stand out on the shelf , or at the home brew sharing party . You will get both an oil painting to hang in your brewery , and license to print and use the labels as many times as you want !
Stubborn Rainbow occurred to me when I was thinking about true names . Everybody has one . A true name is a few words that completely describe someone 's personality , like “ Little Big Man ” . While brewing a perpetually-hopped IPA that I was going to call Hop Cycle , I realized Stubborn Rainbow was the perfect name for it instead ! I have been trying to brew a decent IPA for about 10 years now and have always had disappointing results . Either not enough hops , or oxidation , or something else that prevented me from making the perfect IPA . Due to stubborn perseverance , I have finally achieved an IPA that has a rainbow of flavor . Perpetually hopped refers to the hop additions . When brewing Stubborn Rainbow I boil for 90 minutes while continually adding hops . It starts out slowly as I do n't want a beer that is too bitter , so I add about one or two pellets hops at a time about every four minutes . Then , as it gets closer to the end of the boil I switch to flavoring hops and increase the rate of additions until the last minute when I am just about pouring flavoring hops into the boiling wort . Finally it comes to dry hopping . This is when I have failed in the past . I wait until the primary fermentation is completed , about a week at 69 degrees , and increase the last day to 71 . I rack to secondary and add four ounces of hops to the five gallons . I just drop the loose fresh hops right into the fermenter , and leave them there for another week . The beer is just about done then . I rack it into a keg , turn up the pressure and ba da bing , ba da boom I have a fresh hop IPA that is about worth its weight in gold due to the amount of hops it takes ! Tasting the last of the beer in secondary as it is strained through the loose hops at the bottom of the fermenter compares to any of the freshest , hoppiest commercial beers I have ever tasted . Probably fresher and better !
Here is the recipe to brew about 5 gallons of Stubborn Rainbow Perpetually Hopped IPA .
15 lbs organic two row malt ( or 7.5 lbs – 8 lbs of Pale Malt extract )
.75 lbs 10L Victory malt
½ tsp brewing salts
½ tsp gypsum
.5 oz Centennial hops ( added for the first 45 minutes perpetually )
1.5 oz Centennial hops ( added for the 45-75 minutes of the boil )
2 oz Cascade hops ( added perpetually for the last 15 minutes increasing towards last minute )
4 oz Simcoe hops for dry hopping . Add during secondary fermentation . I have also used Citra hops , which turned out very good .
Depending on your extraction , you should get a 7-9 % beer from this recipe . I nailed my temps on the last batch and it is nearly 9 % , so it 's a sipper !
You 'll end up with about 4 gallons in the end due to wort being absorbed in the massive amount of hops .
I 'm going to hold onto this painting that I made for my home brew , but I hope you will brew an amazing batch and will want to commission me to create a memorable painting and label for it . I would love to work with commercial breweries , as well as home-brewers .

KABUL , Afghanistan — An unpublished United Nations report on female police officers in Afghanistan found accounts of pervasive sexual violence and harassment by their male colleagues , according to Afghan and Western officials familiar with the report .
The report , which the United Nations has circulated only among senior Afghan officials at the Interior Ministry , found that about 90 percent of the police officers interviewed described sexual harassment and sexual violence as a serious problem , and that about 70 percent of the police officers said that they had personally experienced sexual harassment or sexual violence themselves , according to people who saw the report or had it described to them .
While a much smaller fraction reported either being raped or otherwise sexually assaulted , the overall picture was of a police force in which women were constantly at risk .
Although the report has not been made public and was not made available to The New York Times , two other recent reports touched on similar problems , though they did not focus as closely on the issue of sexual assault and harassment .
Many people , myself included , have an aversion to the sensation of things crawling over our skin , whether it be insects , arachnids , or other creepy crawlies . In the early modern period it would seem that people were much more accustomed to having their bodies invaded by visitors , but , like us , found these unwanted guests most disturbing . This aversion to creepy crawlies was brought vividly to my imagination earlier this year at a talk Sasha Handley ( @ sashahandley ) gave about sleeping in early modern England , which they concluded with a wonderful illustration of gigantic bed bugs !
So what creepy crawlies threatened the early modern body ? Well in the Secret Miracles of Nature Levinus Lemnius described that worms were a particular problem for men 's bodies . These did not necessarily crawl over the skin but could be most unpleasant :
It hath been seen sometimes miraculously , that long and round Worms especially , have crambled upwards , and crept forth at the mouth and the nostrils : and they do this by an imbred natural motion , if a man be long fasting . For then they bite the stomach , and seek for meet , and when they find none to satisfie them and preserve their lives , they creep upwards , and hunt for meat as far as the very throat . For they by their natural instinct perceive , that the food comes in that way , and the nostrils being open to the very throat almost , they creep thither , and tickle the part , or else they are cast forth by sneesing , or are pulled forth with ones forefingers.1
Worms not only came out of the throat and nose but according to some texts were voided in the urin : ‘ I saw a Man who had the Colick ( of whom I spake in the Colick ) that made Urin with infinite small worms like mites in cheese , swimming alive therein ; which dying , sanke down in a great lump to the bottom . And I saw the same after in others'.2 Hannah Newton has also noted that worms were particularly thought to affect the bodies of infants and children.3
Worms were n't the only problem . Samuel Pepys recorded in their diary that their maid removed lice from their body as part of their hygiene regime .
So to my wife 's chamber , and there supped and got them cut my hair and look my shirt , for I have itched mightily these six or seven days ; and when all came to all , they find that I am louzy , having found in my head and body above 20 lice , little and great ; which I wonder at , being more than I have had I believe almost these 20 years.4
Samuel Hartlib also recorded in their Ephemerides for 1643 that perfuming the body with the smoke of quicksilver killed lice . They noted that this remedy was ‘ Probatum ' ( proven ) suggesting that he , or someone they knew , had put this to good use in removing lice from the body . In 1656 they likewise recorded that oil of turpentine drove away all fleas , lice and other vermin , and that it could be rubbed on a child 's stomach to force worms out of their bodies by vomiting or by stool.5
Pepys noted , in addition to lice , that fleas affected their quality of sleep . On Saturday 3 September 1664 they noted that ‘ I have had a bad night 's rest to-night , not sleeping well , as my wife observed , and once or twice they did wake me , and I thought myself to be mightily a bit with fleas , and in the morning they chid their mayds for not looking the fleas a-days . ' 6
Fleas did n't confine themselves to the hair . The 1664 edition of Platerus golden practice of physick illustrated , for its readers , the possibility that fleas would find their way into the ears : ‘ The things that get into the Ears , and out again , are chiefly water , when they swim ; also Fleas , and Lice , Chinches , Ear-wiggs , and other creeping things , as worms , the earwig is most feared . ' 7
Unwelcome guests falling or crawling into the ears appears to have been a particular concern . Salvator Winter 's New Dispensatory for example suggested ‘ For an Earwig in the Ear . THe Juice of Wormwood , Rew , and Southernwood , of each a like quantity , put it into the Ear , and lay some of the beaten Herbs unto it , and that will kill it in one night'.8 The recipe collection attributed to Anne Brumwich similarly recorded ‘ A Medicine to kill any quick thinge as flye or flear that is crept into [ th ] e eare'.9
Knowledge about these unwanted visitors was improved during this era as well , as the invention of the microscope allowed them to be viewed and visualised with much greater detail . Robert Hooke 's publication Micrographia became famous for its detailed drawings of microscope observations and in particular this delightful image of a flea . I wonder if reading about such things in medical books and recipe collections or seeing others scratching at their bodies left people itching , the way writing this blog post has left me feeling decidedly itchy and vulnerable ?

New research , reported on by The New York Times this week , argues that Adolf Hitler once wrote a book lauding themselves as Germany 's future savior ― and had it published under another man 's name .
The short book , Adolf Hitler : Their Life and Their Speeches , was purportedly written by Baron Adolf Victor von Koerber and published in 1923 , well before Hitler rose to power . Von Koerber was a real person , an aristocrat with mainstream conservative bona fides . The Times notes that “ [ s ] cholars have said that Hitler sought Mr. von Koerber out for the biography , ” seeking to legitimize themselves through the endorsement of an establishment figure . Now , however , documents found in von Koerber 's archives seem to show that Hitler composed the entire book , with the named author contributing nothing but their byline .
Published before Mein Kampf , and before he 'd seriously begun jockeying for national power , the book compared them to Jesus and advanced an image of the rabble-rousing beer-hall speaker as a vital force in German politics .
Obviously , this angle would be way more convincing if someone other than Hitler wrote it ― and research from Thomas Weber , a historian at the University of Aberdeen , suggests the future dictator knew that all too well . “ He does not have to expressly say , ‘ I want to be leader , ' ” Weber explained to the Times . “ He creates the expectation that others will call them to become the leader . ”
Sound familiar ? With the wheels greased by technology , a false or illusory identity created to legitimize oneself and gin up support has grown into such a phenomenon it has a name : the sockpuppet . A sockpuppet is a false identity used to attack your opponents , express support for yourself , or otherwise create the appearance of false numbers in your camp . Usually these sockpuppets are entirely fictional , unlike Hitler 's von Koerber ; online it 's tricky to prove or disprove the existence of a person behind the Twitter , Reddit , Amazon or Yelp account . ( We can thank that for MTV 's “ Catfish . ” )
Even before that , a certain business person-cum-presidential-candidate took the telephone approach to sockpuppetry . Donald Trump , according to reports this spring , used to speak to journalists while posing as a publicist named John Miller or John Barron ― throughout the 1970s , ‘ 80s , and ‘ 90s . Under this guise , he 'd lavishly praise Trump 's attractiveness to women , their financial health , and their all-around excellence .
But as these reports indicate , sockpuppets often are outed in the end . Trump publicly denied posing as Miller or Barron , but they also admitted to it during testimony in court in 1990 .
Bloomberg via Getty Images Trump , posing as John Miller , reportedly told one journalist in 1991 , `` Actresses just call to see if they can go out with them and things . ”
Scott Adams , the self-aggrandizing cartoonist behind “ Dilbert , ” had a sockpuppet scandal several years ago , when they were caught defending themselves as a “ certified genius ” on a Metafilter thread under another name . Several years before that , New Republic critic Lee Siegel was suspended after being caught posing as a commenter in the New Republic forums in order to castigate their haters and swaddle themselves in praise .
From Hitler to the Twitter eggs clogging up your mentions , the intent is the same : To manipulate public opinion by creating a mirage of external validation for the originator .
To be clear : Using a sockpuppet is not remotely equivalent to Nazism ― it 's a tactic , not a governing philosophy or a set of political beliefs . ( Godwin 's Law check ! ) Another caveat comes , in the Times article , from Harvard historian Charles S. Maier , who cautions that this revelation may prove little more than Hitler 's use of a similar approach to many politicians working with ghostwriters on as-told-to biographies .
R Sridhar is set to return as India 's fielding coach for the three-Test series against New Zealand . Sources confirmed Sridhar , who is currently in Australia with the India A team , will replace Abhay Sharma , and join the team in Kanpur for the first Test . The details of their contract , however , are understood to not have been finalised yet .
It is learnt India coach Anil Kumble was keen on re-appointing Sridhar , whose contract came to an end in April after the World T20 . `` Kumble contacted Sridhar immediately after they took over as coach and advised them to wait till they came back from the West Indies and took a call [ on Sridhar 's appointment ] , '' a source familiar with the developments told ESPNcricinfo . `` The BCCI sent an e-mail to the India A team manager late last evening asking Sridhar to report in Kanpur ahead of the first Test . Sridhar might have to leave midway through the second four-day Test between India A and Australia A from September 15 to 18 . ''
While Abhay travelled with the team for the Zimbabwe and West Indies tours in a stop-gap capacity , BCCI president Anurag Thakur had said full-time appointments would be made before September 15 . Sanjay Bangar , who went on both the tours , will continue as batting coach , while no bowling coach is expected to be appointed at least until the end of the New Zealand series .
Sridhar and Bangar had begun their first stints as assistant coaches to Ravi Shastri , who was brought in as team director , during the limited-overs leg of the England tour in August 2014 after India had lost the Test series . Their contracts were first extended until the end of the World Cup in 2015 , before they were renewed till the end of the World T20 the following year .
A Labour donor has been accused by a local authority chief executive of threatening to coerce their council into selling a lucrative piece of land .
Developer James Kean allegedly told South Lanarkshire council officials that , unless the site was sold to their charity , they would use information they had to ensure that `` people were not re-elected '' .
The charity 's legal representative described the claims as `` preposterous '' and asked the council to withdraw the allegation .
Kean is an East Kilbride-based business person whose firms have made donations to the Labour party .
In 2011 , their association with local Labour MP Michael McCann was the subject of a BBC Scotland investigation .
It was alleged that McCann , when serving on South Lanarkshire Council , did not declare their ties with Kean when dealing with planning issues relating to the tycoon .
Both McCann and Keane denied any wrongdoing .
Kean is at the centre of another controversy with the Labour-controlled council , this time involving the East Kilbride Community Trust ( EKCT ) , of which they are a trustee and major funder .
This newspaper revealed last year that the EKCT wanted to buy council land in the Langlands area of the town for £175,000 in order to build a sports arena .
McCann offered the `` magnificent project '' their support but the council declined due to the offer being below market rate .
Emails , volunteered to this newspaper by the Trust , reveal an extraordinary row between the charity 's legal representative Stuart Chalmers and council chief executive Lindsay Freeland on the land talks .
Kean and Chalmers met senior council officers about the issue in June last year , a meeting the local authority 's head of administration and legal services Geraldine McCann also attended .
Ms McCann also serves as the council 's Monitoring Officer , whose job is to raise issues of concern with the chief executive .
Eight days after the meeting , the council chief executive emailed Chalmers :
`` As you know , the Council 's Monitoring Officer was in attendance at the meeting and they have provided me with an update of the meeting and raised some concerns regarding statements made during the meeting .
`` I understand that your client referred to a 'trump card which they had up their sleeve ' information which they held and was prepared to use if the Council did not agree to sell the land to him . ''
Freeland continued : `` This could be interpreted to be a threat to coerce the Council to undertake a particular course of action . I note that your client did not provide any detail of the nature of this information other than that they were 'prepared to use it to ensure that people were not re-elected ' . ''
`` If your client is implying that any officer or elected member has acted with impropriety , then I would be obliged if you would provide me with more detail of the nature of the alleged information to allow me to take the appropriate action . ''
Chalmers responded : `` The Trustees ... have asked me to convey their deepest concern about the language of your second paragraph .
`` The suggestion that any words said by Mr Kean 'could be interpreted as a threat to coerce the Council to undertake a particular course of action ' is an extremely serious one . In view of the nature of this comment the Trustees require that it is withdrawn . The Trustees also require a copy of the note of the meeting taken by the Monitoring Officer .
`` Mr Kean also wishes to put on record that they did not use the phrase 'prepared to use it to ensure that people were not re-elected ' . They did make a reference to the next Council election and it is their recollection that the words used were quite clearly stating their wish that their dealings with the Council would hopefully improve if a new batch of Councillors is to be elected at that time . ''
However , the chief executive supported the Monitoring Officer in another email to Chalmers :
`` I note your interpretation of the comments made by Mr Kean at the meeting . However , having discussed the matter with the Council 's Monitoring Officer , they have confirmed , to me , their interpretation and I am therefore not prepared to withdraw the comments to which you object to in the second paragraph of your email .
`` The Council 's Monitoring Officer has confirmed to me that the statement was made , and in their opinion , could be interpreted in the way set out in my email of 24 June 2014 . ''
`` The Council 's Monitoring Officer prepared a note of the meeting . The note is confidential and I am unable to provide you with a copy . ''
Chalmers responded by again disputing the `` preposterous '' claim :
`` Apart from the quantum leap required to attribute anything threatening to those particular words , how can a `` Council '' ( a non person ) , feel threatened ? ''
`` The Trustees reiterate their request that you withdraw your suggestion of a threat or a perceived threat to the Council . ''
They added : `` The Council 's shortcomings in its dealings with the Trust constitute a disgrace which the people of East Kilbride deserve to know about , and no doubt they will soon enough . ''
The land deal was not agreed , but the council voted to enter negotiations about granting the charity a right of access through the Langlands site to develop other land under the EKCT 's control .
It is understood the dispute regarding Kean 's alleged statements remains unresolved .
A spokesperson for the council : `` It would not be appropriate to discuss conversations in meetings that are commercially sensitive . ''
Asked to comment on the row , Chalmers said : `` It 's all in the emails . It 's there for you to see , and we are quite happy for these to be quoted , as long as they are quoted fairly . ''
An SNP spokesperson said : `` There is no absolutely place for threats in Scottish politics - Labour must confirm that any donations given by Mr Kean for the general election campaign have been returned immediately while this matter is fully investigated . ''
Sc��ottish Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone said : `` This is typical of the murky world of Lanarkshire Labour . You 'd think lessons had been learned after the Falkirk fiasco , but Labour is a party that never learns . ''
A PERTH man has successfully patented and will soon begin selling a cross between a hamburger and a hotdog - dubbed the “ Hamdog ” - across the country .
Mark Murray first pitched their idea on Channel 10 's Shark Tank program last year , after successfully securing a US patent for the “ combination hamburger hot dog bread bun ” in 2009 .
“ Everyone told me it was n't possible , because you 'd need a patent lawyer and it would cost millions of dollars , ” Mr Murray told news.com.au .
“ Even [ Boost Juice founder and Shark Tank judge ] Janine Allis told me that it was impossible to patent . She 'll be eating their words now , ” Mr Murray said .
media_camera Inside the Hamdog .
Conceived in 2004 , the $ 8 Hamdog consists of a Bunbury beef patty cut in half , with a Hunsa frankfurt inserted in the middle . It 's topped with lettuce , tomato , cheese , pickles and three sauces - American mustard , tomato sauce and mayonnaise .
The bun is created in special made-to-order moulds by hand in a Perth bakery .
“ We use all local ingredients . The only thing that 's not from WA are the pickles , ” Mr Murray said .
“ At the moment there is a fair bit of labour involved in making the buns because they 're made by people , not machines . We 're still developing a way to semi automate production . ”
media_camera The official US patent of the Hamdog bun .
The Hamdog marquee will appear at events such as local markets , shows , races in Perth . Mr Murray says so far , the response has been “ incredible ” .
“ We launched our marquee two months ago and we had people come from everywhere just to experience the Hamdog . At one stage the crew were knocking out about one every 15 seconds . It was amazing , ” they said .
He 's currently inviting people to buy into their business so the Hamdog can be sold around the country . For $ 10,000 you can become a “ reseller ” , similar to a franchisee , with your own Hamdog marquee .
For now there 's only the one Hamdog for sale , but Mr Murray says their team is considering expanding the menu .
“ We 've had requests of all sorts for gluten free , vegan and vegetarian Hamdogs , ” they said . “ Once the product is out there and that process is sorted , we 'll start experimenting . ”

LANSING , Mich. ( AP ) — Michigan would forgive more than $ 600 million in extra `` responsibility '' fees that have been assessed to 317,000 motorists for certain traffic offenses under new legislation that is designed to help them regain their licenses and stop driving illegally .
The bipartisan bills announced Thursday , which are supported by Republican House Speaker Tom Leonard , would wipe away the debt a year from now . Newly assessed state fees , already set to end in October 2019 , would be stopped a year earlier .
Leonard , of DeWitt , said when they worked as a prosecutor in the Flint area they saw the `` awful impact '' of the additional fees , which now range from $ 100 to $ 2,000 for driving without insurance , accumulating too many points from traffic infractions and committing other offenses . They said far too many working people paid their ticket only to be `` hit with new , impossible surcharges , often costing them their licenses , and then their jobs , and then their ability to ever pay off the mountain of debt . ... It is well past time we repealed this unjust mistake . ''
The responsibility fees were enacted by former Gov . Jennifer Granholm and lawmakers in 2003 to deter drivers who repeatedly violate traffic safety laws . But the fees have come under criticism as a government `` money grab '' that disproportionately hurts low-income motorists who can not afford to pay .
In 2011 , the Legislature and Gov . Rick Snyder did away with some fees . In 2014 , they moved to phase out all of them in the future and gave residents a one-year window in which they could do volunteer work instead of paying the fees for certain offenses .
Secretary of State Ruth Johnson called the fees a `` double penalty '' and criticized how they are automatically assessed without giving judges a chance to review the circumstances .
Leonard spokesperson Gideon D'Assandro said more than half of the $ 600 million in debt is more than 6 years old .
`` This money 's never coming in . It 's just putting a debt on people who ca n't pay it , '' they said .
The seven-bill package would also reinstate the community service option for people wanting to get back their licenses before the debt was cleared in 2018 and give immediate relief to those who already have a payment plan with the state .
One of the bill sponsors , Democratic Rep. Phil Phelps of Flushing , said drivers `` deserve a clean slate '' and it makes sense to address the fees amid increasing demands for legislators to address the state 's expensive auto insurance premiums .
Similar legislation is being crafted in the GOP-led Senate .
Snyder spokesperson Tanya Baker noted that they signed the 2014 legislation to lessen and phase out responsibility fees but `` would need a complete fiscal analysis '' before assessing whether they have any budgetary concerns with forgiving outstanding fees .

pysdl2-cffi is a Python wrapper for SDL2 written using cffi , featuring :
A cffi interface to the underlying SDL2 libraries .
Automatically generated , consistent helper functions for SDL2 , SDL_image , SDL_mixer , and SDL_ttf that hide most allocation and dereferencing .
Useful docstrings on every function , including the C function signature and ( for SDL2 only ) the library 's original doxygen documentation reformatted as Sphinx restructured text .
A small collection of libSDL2 's original example / test programs converted to Python using Eric S. Raymond 's ctopy .
The goal is to provide a flat , consistent , faithful-to-C binding with some more-Pythonic renaming and conveniences .
This wrapper wo n't contain anything that does n't directly translate to part of the library 's API . The goal is to be a dependency for something like pygame , not a replacement .
This library should be compatible with Linux , OSX and Windows .
This library is licensed under the GPLv2 or ( at your option ) any later version . Alternatively a commercial license can be purchased from the author for $ 10 .
Install with pip , or download from https : //pypi.python.org/pypi/pysdl2-cffi
Source hosted at https : //bitbucket.org/dholth/pysdl2-cffi
Documentation hosted at https : //pythonhosted.org/pysdl2-cffi
0.8.0 The wrapper is now built with cffi 1.1 's verify ( ) mode and requires a C compiler to build . It is much faster than the previous version on CPython .
Appveyor-built binary packages now available on Windows . On Windows , the necessary SDL2 DLLs are now a pip-installed dependency .
0.7.0 Struct wrappers now expose all the attributes of the C-level struct as properties . Great for tinkering , as the property names can now be inspected interactively .
Struct wrappers no longer pass all attribute access through getattr/setattr . Arbitrary data can be attached to the struct wrappers as is customary in Python .
Fix a capitalization error for the “ classy ” API to conform to the general binding rules . ob.gL_Function is now ob.GL_Function .
0.6.0 Windows is now supported ! You must manually download the SDL2 dll 's and place them on PATH set PATH= % PATH % ; C : \users\me\SDL2Dir but pysdl2-cffi will attempt to load the Windows .dll as well as the Unix .so .
After two dangerous tours in Afghanistan , Marine Cpl . Alex Pohle confronted a new threat on the home front : a burglar in their parents ' Spokane Valley home .
Home for the holidays , the 22-year-old Pohle returned to their house after running errands and found the front door open “ as plain as a summer 's day. ” The family dog sat in the front yard along the 12400 block of East Desmet Road .
Without hesitation Pohle rushed inside after telling their wife to stay in the car . They stormed into the home , burst into their parents bedroom and took suspected burglar Christopher Schwanke , 43 , to the floor .
After a short struggle , Pohle had them in a choke hold and Schwanke pleaded for their freedom . “ Let me go , let me go , ” Pohle 's mom heard Schwanke begging before they stopped moving .
Pohle credited their military training for the take down move and pointed out the blood on their pants and shirt that did n't belong to him .
Alex and their parents , Kerrie and Jim , held the burglar down until Spokane Valley deputies arrived within minutes - around 10:45 a.m .
A deputy raced through the front door with a 12-gauge shotgun in hand , Pohle said , and took Schwanke into custody .
“ They were like ‘ Who put the thumpin ' on him ? ' ” Pohle said . “ I did . ”
Pohle , a 2008 University High School graduate , said their nerves were not shaken , but they quickly smoked a cigarette until their grandparents showed up . “ Grandpa says they picked on the wrong Marine , ” said Pohle 's grandmother , Audrey Knottel. “ He 's a strong kid . ”
Kerrie Pohle , Alex 's mother , said : “ He does n't know their own strength . ”
That strength came in handy during their time in Afghanistan when a roadside bomb hit their convoy in the Helmand Province .
Pohle recalls the ringing in their ears . The blast disabled their vehicle . Nobody died .
Now stationed at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune , Pohle has four more years to go and hopes to become a drill sergeant for future Marines . Their father says they have the voice for it .
Ultimately , Pohle hopes for a career in the Washington State Patrol as a trooper .
As for the ransacked Pohle home , Jim Pohle , Alex 's father , is simply glad they had someone there to take care of it . The burglar tried to get away with Jim Pohle 's hunting gear and their wife 's jewelry .
Deputies described the burglar as a repeat offender with a 27-year criminal record .
Medics took Schwanke to a local hospital for their injuries . They were then booked into Spokane County Jail for residential burglary .
My name is Adam Penney , I rescued Benny from the SPCA in St. John 's almost a year ago and we have been best friends ever since . Before Benny found their way to me they unfortunately had a fairly traumatic life . We live alone together and the nature of my work let 's me spend a lot of time with him , we would walk around downtown St. John 's 2-3 hours a day . They have become very important in my life and has come a long way in the short time I have had him .
In December I started to notice a limp on their back right leg . After a number of vet visits , x-rays , and the final surgical consultation today ( Feb 02 ) I was given the bad news . My sweet , wonderful , and shy boy Benny has torn their CrCL ( cranial cruciate ligament ) in their right knee and unfortunately needs a very costly surgery called TPLO ( tibial-plateau-leveling osteotomy ) .
The surgery is going to cost more than I had originally thought . $ 5500 for the surgery alone , not including subsequent check ups and the over $ 1200 already spent on the diagnoses . It has become a large burden for someone working in a freelance creative field here in St. John 's .
Anything you can do helps and will go along way to giving Benny back the life they deserve .

Google has announced a change to its user consent policy which will affect website publishers using Google products and services , including Google AdSense , DoubleClick for Publishers and DoubleClick Ad Exchange , as well as whose sites or apps have visitors arriving from the European Union . Under the new policy , publishers will have to obtain EU end users ' consent before storing or accessing their data , says Google .
The change , which is in direct response to the EU 's cookie compliance regulations , follows the arrival of the Google-published website called CookieChoices , spotted earlier this month . That site was launched with the intention of helping digital publishers obtain tools and access other resources that will aid in their obligations to obtain user consent , Google noted at the time .
These tools include code that website publishers can use to inform visitors about their cookies , as well as those that can be used to directly obtain consent , like splash screens , notification bars , or one-time , pop-up alerts that can be used on mobile apps .
Says Jason Woloz , Google 's Security & Privacy Program Manager , Display and Video Ads , in a brief announcement posted today , “ it has always been Google 's policy to comply with privacy laws , so we 've agreed to make certain changes affecting our own products and partners using Google products . ”
EU regulators have pushed for years for a variety of user protections when it comes to how web users ' data and information is tracked and made available online . One of its more-discussed rulings in recent months is related to the so-called “ Right to be forgotten , ” which legally requires that search engines like Google process individuals ' requests for the delisting of inaccurate , outdated and irrelevant data .
Meanwhile , the EU has had regulations related to cookie-related data collection for quite some time . But what 's notable is that Google is applying this to its own services , while also challenging publishers to comply with the updated policy by a September 30th , 2015 deadline , according to an email sent out about the change . In addition , this policy will also affect those with iOS or Android applications who will have to show a message to app users upon first launch .
While before , the EU 's cookie policy has been common for those sites based in the EU , Google 's policy change will affect a number of publishers , as any site on the web could potentially have EU-based traffic .
The effectiveness of cookie-related user consent notifications is questionable , however . According to a late 2014 study on the matter , the EU 's cookie-notification policy has cost billions of euros per year in terms of compliance costs for websites , but has offered few benefits to web users . That is to say , the implementations thus far have not changed user behavior , the report found .
Unfortunately , Google ca n't offer a consent message that publishers can use , because a website or app 's consent message should say “ will largely depend on your own uses of cookies and other information , and the third party services you work with , ” says Google . But it does offer pointers on the Cookie Choices website to help publishers get started .
Google 's post also points to other resources beyond Cookie Choices , including a Help Center FAQ which details the answers to questions publishers may have , like which products are impacted , how to tell if a current policy is compliant , how the changes affect mobile websites , and more .
Here , Google also explains that the Article 29 Working Party , an umbrella body that comprises representatives of all EU data protection authorities , requested that changes were made to how site publishers request consent from end users . Google says it understands “ these principles will be applied across the industry , ” which is why it 's rolling out the change now .
Yesterday , Google announced the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL , two phones I 've been excited about for a while now . They have big screens , a delightfully playful design sensibility , and what promises to be a fascinating upgrade to the previous Pixel 's best-in-class camera .
They also do n't have headphone jacks .
Predictably , my Twitter replies exploded . Last year I wrote a piece calling the removal of headphone jacks from phones “ user-hostile and stupid ” in the lead-up to the iPhone 7 launch . Google and Samsung certainly were n't shy in pointing out that their phones retained the 3.5mm connector , and now it 's gone from the Pixel 2 . If Google and Apple agree on something , it has to be the correct decision , right ?
If Google and Apple agree on something , it has to be the correct decision , right ?
Well , I do n't think so . ( And just like last year , I would point you to my friend and colleague Vlad Savov , who argues that losing the headphone jack is perhaps not so bad . He 's smart , that Vlad . )
So , here 's the problem : headphones , as we have understood them for decades , were once terrifically simple . You could plug any headphones from virtually anywhere into virtually anything , and they would just work . Anyone could make headphones , anyone could sell them , and all of those people could address the entire market of people who wanted to listen to things .
As the headphone jack disappears , the obvious replacement is n't another wire with a proprietary connector like Apple 's Lightning or the many incompatible and strange flavors of USB-C audio . It 's Bluetooth . And Bluetooth continues to suck , for a variety of reasons . Newer phones like the iPhone 8 , Galaxy S8 , and the Pixel 2 have Bluetooth 5 , which promises to be better , but 1 ) there are literally no Bluetooth 5 headphones out yet , and 2 ) we have definitely heard that promise before . So we 'll see .
What 's fair and rational for platform vendors is n't always great for consumers
To improve Bluetooth , platform vendors like Apple and Google are riffing on top of it , and that means they 're building custom solutions . And building custom solutions means they 're taking the opportunity to prioritize their own products , because that is a fair and rational thing for platform vendors to do .
Unfortunately , what is fair and rational for platform vendors is n't always great for markets , competition , or consumers . And at the end of this road , we will have taken a simple , universal thing that enabled a vibrant market with tons of options for every consumer , and turned it into yet another limited market defined by ecosystem lock-in .
10 years from now every Nintendo device will ship with one pair of headphones that can only be used with that specific individual console . — Adi Robertson ( @ thedextriarchy ) October 5 , 2017
The playbook is simple : last year , Apple dropped the headphone jack and replaced it with its W1 system , which is basically a custom controller chip and software management layer for Bluetooth . The exemplary set of W1 headphones is , of course , AirPods , but Apple also owns Beats , and there are a few sets of W1 Beats headphones available as well . You can still use regular Bluetooth headphones with an iPhone , and you can use AirPods as regular Bluetooth headphones , but the combination iPhone / W1 experience is obviously superior to anything else on the market . No one else can make W1 headphones , and obviously no one else can modify iOS to support their own custom wireless Bluetooth riff . So your choices are the four W1 headphones , and then a large market of second-class citizens .
Bluetooth problems I have had Every one of these things has happened to me repeatedly in the past six weeks : I receive a phone call and it automatically plays through a Bluetooth speaker in another room which I thought was disconnected My wife can not pair to a Bluetooth speaker until they restart their iPhone My wife is using a Bluetooth speaker with their phone and my phone takes it over with a phone call Multiple Bluetooth devices fight to be connected at once , and I have to unpair one to get the one I want to work Hitting “ connect ” on the Bluetooth screen does n't establish a connection , so I have to forget the device and re-pair it Forgetting a Bluetooth device and re-pairing it every time I use it because I know it 's just faster
Google 's version of this is the Pixel Buds , a set of over-ear neckbuds that serve as basic Bluetooth headphones but gain additional capabilities when used with certain phones . Seamless fast pairing ? You need Android N or higher , which most Android phones do n't have . The always-on access to Google Assistant ? That 's only for Android phones with Google Assistant ; iPhone owners need not apply . And that cool Google Translate integration where Pixel Buds instantly translate languages in real time ? Well , that 's entirely exclusive to the Pixel .
Google being Google , some of this stuff is more open than Apple . Vlad has already heard from headphone vendors that are going to support Google 's fast pairing , and there 's an updated version of the beloved Bose QC35s that support Assistant . But all of that stuff is part of Google 's platform , not Bluetooth : it goes away when you use these headphones with something other than Android or a Pixel . Google told me the Pixel Buds will simply be “ basic Bluetooth headphones ” when used with an iPhone .
Zooming out , it 's also easy to see that headphones are becoming a major piece of the voice / assistant puzzle , and the dominant players in mobile platforms are going to prioritize their own products in significant ways so they can get those assistants in your ears . I would be shocked if Samsung did n't kill the headphone jack on the next iteration of the Galaxy line and come out with special wireless headphones with exclusive features , like access to Bixby . Everyone wants Bixby headphones , right ? Welcome to hell .
Everyone wants Bixby headphones , right ? Welcome to hell
Third-party vendors like Shure and Bose should be scared out of their minds : they will never get the system-level access they need to compete with platform owners . Pebble failed as a smartwatch in part because it did n't have enough access to the operating system to do things the Apple Watch and Android Wear can do , like reply to text messages . That future is coming for your favorite headphone company . How does a Skullcandy or a Bowers & Wilkins compete when they 're relegated to second-class connectivity and feature sets ? Why would any rational consumer buy anything but the wireless headphones guaranteed to work best with their phones ?

Maybe this will all shake out fine . Maybe Bluetooth 5 is actually wonderful , and enough people do n't care about stable connectivity or real-time Google Translate to keep the headphone market thriving . But there 's a version of the world coming where ecosystem lock-in extends to headphones and speakers , and where every device you own has a different first-party set of wireless audio accessories that work best inside a closed loop of software and services . The walls just keep closing in .
And that ... is pretty user-hostile and stupid .
A recently unveiled Russian plan to stabilize Syria after more than six years of civil war is the most urgent foreign policy topic on the agenda , according to The Associated Press .
Both governments have said they want to end a civil war that has killed up to 400,000 people and allowed the self-proclaimed Islamic State ( IS ) to emerge as a global terror threat .
The continued fighting between rebels and the Moscow-backed Syrian president Bashar al-Assad 's military has complicated US efforts to defeat IS .
A plan is a plan
Lavrov arrives in the US capital after discussing an agreement with Iran and Turkey last week .
The plan focuses on the creation of four de-escalation zones , which would not cover areas where the US-led coalition is fighting IS .
Details still need to be finalized and the US response has been cautious , Defense Secretary Jim Mattis saying administration officials are still studying the concept and its various unanswered questions .
Watch video 00:33 Syrian 'safe zone ' deal comes into effect
Best of enemies ?
The meeting will be the highest-level contact between Trump and the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin since Trump took office on January 20 .
Lavrov has n't visited Washington at all since 2013 , a year before Russia 's annexation of Ukraine 's Crimea region and two years before it intervened militarily in Syria to help Assad remain in power .
Relations apparently deteriorated between the US and Russia after US air strikes hit a Syrian airfield in April in response to a chemical weapons attack that Washington blamed on Assad .
The meeting could signal that the two governments have improved ties that Trump recently described as being at an `` all-time low . ''
Lavrov will meet earlier in the day with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , The Associated Press learned .
Russian connection not going away
The meeting will be hard to separate from the unfolding political drama in Washington .
FBI and congressional investigations are looking into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Kremlin related to last year 's presidential election .
US intelligence agencies accuse Moscow of meddling to help Trump 's chances of victory .
On Tuesday Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey , ousting the nation 's top law enforcement official amid the FBI 's investigation into Trump 's ties with Russia .
In January , Trump fired their national security adviser , Michael Flynn , saying Flynn had misled senior administration officials about their pre-inauguration talks with Sergey Kislyak , Russia 's ambassador in Washington .
In a Senate hearing Monday , former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said they had `` bluntly warned '' Trump 's White House in January that Flynn `` essentially could be blackmailed '' by the Russians because they apparently had lied about their contacts with Kislyak .
Trump has said they have no ties to Russia and is n't aware of any involvement by their aides in any Russian election interference . They call the various investigations a `` hoax '' driven by Democrats .

During the final presidential debate , the moderator asked Mitt Romney about President Obama 's policy of killing suspected terrorists , including U.S. citizens , with missiles fired from unmanned aircraft . `` I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world , '' Romney replied . `` I support that entirely . ''
In other words , Romney has no qualms about trusting one man with the power to order the summary execution of anyone , anywhere in the world , whom they deem `` a threat to us . '' This bipartisan disregard for civil liberties is the rule rather than the exception for the two major presidential candidates , who are about equally bad when it comes to respecting constitutional rights , although in somewhat different ways .
Both candidates find certain kinds of speech intolerable . Romney 's campaign has signaled that he , unlike Obama , will waste Justice Department resources on prosecuting people for pornography made by and for consenting adults . Then again , Romney supports Citizens United v. FEC , the 2010 Supreme Court decision that lifted restrictions on political speech by unions and corporations , which Obama condemns .
Both candidates also are inconsistent in their fidelity to the First Amendment 's guarantee of religious freedom . During the 2010 controversy over the so-called Ground Zero mosque , Obama defended `` the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in Lower Manhattan , '' while Romney demanded `` rejection of this site . '' By contrast , Romney defended religious liberty in this year 's dispute over the Obama administration 's mandate requiring Catholic institutions to provide health coverage for contraceptives .
Although Obama and Romney both say they support the right to keep and bear arms , both have backed arbitrary , ignorance-driven bans on `` assault weapons . '' Obama has gone further , claiming local handgun bans are consistent with the Second Amendment .
Moving to the never-ending War on Terror , the differences between Obama and Romney are even smaller . The two candidates agree that the president may detain terrorism suspects indefinitely as well as kill them at a distance . Obama never delivered on their promise to close the symbol of that policy , the military prison at Guantanamo Bay , while Romney has said `` we ought to double Guantanamo . ''
Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 , which `` affirms '' the legality of military detention `` without trial '' for people the president believes have joined or assisted Al Qaeda , the Taliban , or `` associated forces . '' Romney says they would have signed the bill too , because `` people who join Al Qaeda are not entitled to rights of due process . '' That formulation begs the question of how we know that terrorism suspects are in fact terrorists , which is the sort of issue due process is supposed to resolve .
Obama and Romney , both of whom support the PATRIOT Act , likewise see eye to eye on warrantless surveillance of international communications involving people in the U.S. , which Obama voted to authorize in 2008 after calling it `` unconstitutional '' in a 2007 Boston Globe questionnaire . Responding to the same survey , Romney , who at the time was seeking the 2008 Republican presidential nomination , dodged the question of whether the president has `` inherent powers under the Constitution to conduct surveillance for national security purposes without judicial warrants , regardless of federal statutes . ''
Romney 's response to that question reflects their general disdain for civil libertarian criticism of counterterrorism policies : `` Our most basic civil liberty is the right to be kept alive , and the President should not hesitate to use every legal tool at their disposal to keep America safe . '' For Romney , who endorses `` enhanced interrogation techniques , '' one such tool seems to be waterboarding , which he , unlike Obama ( and John McCain , the GOP 's 2008 presidential nominee ) , refuses to describe as torture .
Back in 2008 , condemning the excesses of the Bush administration , Obama sounded better on civil liberties than Romney . Except for waterboarding , however , Obama 's counterterrorism policies have been essentially the same as their predecessor 's , but with more extrajudicial killings . Do n't get fooled again .
The obvious question is why ? Why would the Obama administration who boasted open and transparent discussions of such a sensitive subject as healthcare close the door to the opportunity to present its factual case to the American people ? Messaging anyone ? Nope .
Complying with the records request from the House Energy and Commerce Committee “ would constitute a vast and expensive undertaking ” and could “ implicate longstanding executive branch confidentiality interests , ” White House lawyer Robert Bauer wrote the committee . Translation : Nice try .
Before the Democrats rammed through the Obamacare bill ( and do n't think for one little ol ' minute that our narcissistic President does n't love that branding ) , Obama and WH officials met with several high-profile insurance executives as the WaPo lists :
The list included George Halvorson , chairperson and CEO of Kaiser Health Plans ; Scott Serota , president and CEO of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association ; Kenneth Kies , a Washington lobbyist representing Blue Cross/Blue Shield , among other clients ; Billy Tauzin , then head of PhRMA , the drug industry lobby ; Richard Umbdenstock , chief of the American Hospital Association ; and numerous others .
The most concerning is George Halvorson as they were the only executive to meet with Obama . And here is why :
“ There really are two Americas when it comes to health care — the fully insured , primarily white America and the disproportionately uninsured minority America , ” Halvorson wrote . “ More than half of the total uninsured people in this country are minority . That fact alone should make the need to cover everyone in America a pure ethical imperative . This issue is not about economics — it is about equality . Universal coverage should be the next major civil rights issue for this country to face .
Halvorson also wrote an article in 2007 equating health reform to the “ unfinished business of the Civil Rights agenda. ” Halvorson discusses the disparities between the races and health care coverage and states :
If we considered no other issue than racial and ethnic disparities , this nation 's leadership — like the leadership of a number of states — should be moving this country down the path to an American form of universal coverage as quickly as possible . There is no more vital or meaningful way for us to honor and extend the great legacy of Martin Luther King Jr .
Again , Halvorson was also the only insurance executive to meet with Obama at that time . Why ? Is it because Obama wants a single-payer system and sees themselves as finishing the Civil Rights Movement , and Halvorson has the same viewpoint and the most to gain via Kaiser Permanente ? But , hey , there 's nothing to see here , right ? Or , is it that those meetings were , as Halvorson stated :
“ The real discussion this time , behind those closed doors , is about changing the way care is delivered . Not about the cost . ”
Now , that is confusing . According to former WH Budget Director , Peter Orszag , I thought that we were on an unsustainable path , so how could costs not come up in these meetings ? So , if we now know that those meetings were about how our healthcare is to be delivered , would n't that be cause enough for alarm ? Some questions that pop into my mind are : how are those changes going to be implemented , what type of practitioner has direct access to patients , who has the ability to refer to specialists , who orders advanced tests/images , who makes the medical decisions , what protocols are being set/followed and who sets them , and do patients have access to all available treatment options .
Additionally , the Washington Times article cites that the Clinton and Bush administrations thwarted such calls :
President George W. Bush 's administration beat back efforts to reveal the dealings between Vice President Dick Cheney 's energy task force and industry . President Bill Clinton 's administration successfully resisted demands for records of its failed push to remake the health care system , which was overseen by then-first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton .
However , unlike the previous scenarios , this is now the law of the land , American taxpayers will be footing the entire bill , and will potentially ultimately have their healthcare decisions placed in the government 's control . Does n't that give us the right to that information trumping the “ implicate longstanding executive branch confidentiality interests ” excuse . And since when does this administration give a hoot about costs , nullifying the argument that the compliance with the records request “ would constitute a vast and expensive undertaking . ”
To quote NRO 's Jim Geraghty , did the Obama administration just administer the Cee-Lo Green option on Americans ?

Bitcoin 's history of volatility is legendary with periods during late 2013 where there were daily changes of over 40 % in either direction . However , since that time Bitcoin 's volatility has gradually decreased to the point where now it is at an all-time low and more comparable to other assets such as Gold .
The Canadian Bitcoin Volatility Index ( CBVIX ) records the 30-day historical volatility using daily closing prices calculated from a volume-weighted calculation of all Bitcoin trades processed in Canadian Dollars since the first data point in September 2011 . The chart shown displays how Bitcoin 's volatility , since peaking at ~350 % in late 2013 , has fallen to its current level of 18.24 % ( a reduction of some ~95 % ) . Determining the average historical volatility for a 30 day period by year , the trend becomes even more apparent .
Volatility Overview
Volatility is simply a measure of the degree of variation over time , where typically , an asset that is more volatile is considered more risky . Volatility can generally be categorized into two groups ; Historical volatility ( which is what the CBVIX references ) and implied volatility . Simply put , historical volatility is a measure of past volatility by measuring previous market movements whereas implied volatility is a derived measure of volatility from trading derivatives , specifically options .
Volatility is typically presented as an annualized figure such that we can directly compare different asset classes which may trade over different periods . For example , the current CBVIX value is ~18 % which means that in the next year , assuming that the current levels of volatility stay constant , we may expect the price of Bitcoin to fall within plus or minus ~18 % of the current value . So , given the last closing price of $ 554.92 and the HV ( 30 ) value of 18.24 % if Bitcoin 's volatility maintains the current level we expect in the next year the price to fall in the range of $ 656.14 and $ 453.70 .
Whilst elevated volatility is generally considered a positive for active traders , who can profit from the large price swings , when used as a currency stability is naturally preferred . Bitcoin 's history of volatility has led to services , which whilst they allow users to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment , they are immediately converted to fiat to remove the risk of dramatic movements in the value of Bitcoin . Alternative services , and so-called stable coins ( such as the Bitshares BitUSD ) have been created to peg the value of Bitcoin to other asset classes such that the user does not have to convert to fiat but instead retains their Bitcoin at the current rate , in the asset of their choosing , through the use of derivatives .
Comparing Bitcoin 's current historical volatility to other asset classes it is currently approaching that of Gold , the TSX stock market index and even the Canadian Dollar relative to the US Dollar .
Bitcoin : 18.24 %
USD/CAD : 10.73 %
TSX : 9.49 %
Gold : 16.63 %
Whilst historical volatility is a useful metric it tells us nothing about future volatility . Indeed , low volatility is often a precursor of a larger move . When prices are stable this indicates a relative equilibrium of supply and demand and once this equilibrium is broken for any reason there may be a sharp move in either direction . To predict future volatility we turn to implied volatility .
Implied Volatility
Implied volatility is a derived value for volatility that is calculated based on options prices , which means it is derived from actual trades being placed as to how volatility will behave in the future . As such implied volatility may be used as a forward looking measure .
To summarize the Nobel prize-winning Black-Scholes options pricing model :
The price of an option can be derived from seven factors . The only factor we do n't know is volatility i.e . the volatility in the future . However we do know the historical volatility so all things being equal we can come up with a ‘ fair ' price for an option .
Rearranging this logic if we know the actual price that has been traded for an option we can determine the implied , that is the expected , volatility . However unlike stocks , there is n't an established options market for Bitcoin and those that exist are thinly traded which makes this forward-looking analysis currently not feasible . It is likely only a matter of time before the options market in Bitcoin establishes itself and we are able to calculate implied volatility . With the unknown effects of the upcoming halving of rewards on the price , we would for example , expect implied volatility to be elevated leading up to that date .
CBVIX data is freely available via cbix.ca , the CBIX volatility API or via the Quandl data platform using ticker CBIX/CBVIX . As well as Bitcoin volatility the volatility of the TSX and Gold are also recorded for reference purposes .
Here 's an article in the Atlantic , describing in the typically fawning and servile leftist way a work of “ art ” by an “ Afro-Swedish ” “ artist ” - a cake , to be exact , in the form of an old caricature of a black woman .
This bizarre thing , and the incident it provoked , are really nothing unusual , the only really unusual thing was the ability of a black provocateur and their white allies to produce the combination of fear and disgust that is mostly a thing of times longs past .
Black people know we find their violence and aggression frightening , their crude and unrestrained sexuality disgusting , and their primitive culture , both rural and urban , clownish and childish . They have also known that since the early 60 's we ca n't admit this , and they use this to intimidate us into submission .
I talked about the double bind in Trayvon Martin As A Symptom of Peak Negro but primarily in the context of crime and riots . Briefly , the double bind gives the target two bad choices . Both have bad outcomes . The double bind for crime is a little less insiduous , since it simply requires whites to accept permanent status as an evil people and second-class citizens . The double bind for culture manages to make even submission suspect .
Much of black culture since the 60 's has been the celebration of ghetto behaviors and attitudes . These attitudes may be on some level wrong , it is argued , but they have developed as a matter of self-assertion and self-celebration under white oppression , so they represent the pure essence of life .
The first wave of this was the “ blaxploitation ” movies of the early 70 's . Violent , racist black criminals , especially pimps , were the heroes . Later in the decade , black nightclub music , called “ disco ” and also used by gays in celebration of sexual liberation , was adopted by whites as pop music . This was n't oppositional , as it represented an aping- no pun intended- of upper-class culture , European especially , and sexual norms . White people are actually poorly adapted for the black/gay/ultra-upper-class sexual norm of heavy promiscuity , but that 's another story .
This phenomenon reached its peak and continuous level with the introduction of “ gangsta ” rap in the early 90 's . Rap had been around for a few years at that point , mostly as novelty and comedy music- you may remember Tone Loc . As we saw in Pop Culture , people in the business of selling entertainment realized white suburban teenagers would love the aggressive anti-social message of rappers like the original “ gangstas ” NWA . Public Enemy was radical , but leftists politics do n't interest hormonal teenagers . NWA was purely anti-authority , which does . Later rappers celebrated not just the lives of ghetto punks , but drug dealers and pimps , who make money , buy cool stuff and get sex .
These exaggerated depictions of black oppositional life are objectively disgusting . But you ca n't react in that way , because it 's racist . If you like it , that 's also racist , because you are enjoying depictions of black people behaving badly , which is just a racist stereotype . On a deeper level , even when a white person really embraces this material , they are left feeling alienated , because they are also told that being white , middle-class and suburban , they know nothing of this real , authentic life and are just posers . This is a terrible feeling . I remember reading a teenager from Rancho Palos Verdes , an affluent suburb of Los Angeles , say of their peers , “ There 's a lot of longing to be black. ” What the fuck ? Why , if you were an upper middle-class person living in beauty and luxury , would you envy the lifestyle of poor , stupid people living grim lives empty of not just beauty and luxury , but almost any level of human decency ? Do you know what a pimp does ? Do you know how a gangster gets and keeps what they have ?
On an existential level , the black criminal is of the very highest status in bourgeois Western culture . They defy all convention , makes their own rules , lives life on their own terms , and becomes their own God . This philosophy is the heart of 20th century French existentialism , as typified by Andre Gide .
On a meta level , all this is utterly consistent . In Protestant theology , morality itself is suspect , as a person might come to believe that by behaving morally , they have earned the favor of God . Better to avoid this potential pitfall !
As for the cake- if you eat the cake , you 're a racist . If you do n't eat the cake , you 're a racist . If you are offended by the cake , you are a racist . If you think the cake represents transgressive social criticism , you 're a bourgeois fool who is having the wool pulled over their eyes . If you think the cake is a stupid stunt , you 're a bourgeois fool who does n't understand that art is social commentary , not deftly-executed decoration .
“ Afro-Swedish ” “ artist ” Makode Linde is no artist , he 's a grifting poser . I do n't blame him , it 's nice work if you can get it , freaking out the squares . They get laid and makes money , and gets breathless write-ups on their brilliance from SWPL journalists . But they know he 's a fraud .
A great example of this is Tupac Shakur 's “ T.H.U.G.L.I.F.E ” tattoo . This means , we are reproachfully told , “ The hate U give little infants fucks everyone. ” If you think he 's a gangster and that 's bad , you 're a neanderthal racist . If you think he 's a gangster and that 's cool , you have been fooled , he 's really a sensitive social critic ! If you think he 's a sensitive social critic , you 've been fooled , he 's really a gangster ! If you think he 's a profound , deep combination of gangster and sensitive social critic , you 've still been fooled , because you do n't really know how much of each one , because you 're an out-of-touch white person , or if you 're a black , some kind of Uncle Tom ! Plus it 's all about the Benjamins ! As it should be , because of hundreds of years of racism !
Tupac was a guy with a business . They made money and got laid selling a fantasy to American teenagers , just like Davy Jones , who was also an acclaimed , successful child actor . Gangsta rap , the Monkees . Same thing . But at least it is commonly understood what the Monkees were .
Being cynical about this is the easy way out . It 's an appropriate response , but not enough . The black “ artist ” /provocateur counts on you responding in one of a certain number of ways , all within their frame . You have to call them on the game , every time .
One problem that both HBD advocates and mainstream conservatives make is a refusal to make moral judgments of blacks . HBD advocates because blacks are stupid and ca n't help it , and naturally impulsive and aggressive and ca n't help it . Steve Sailer 's schtick is “ Hey , do n't look at me , it 's just the statistics ! ” Mainstream conservatives because blacks have been fooled by leftists into abandoning bourgeois morality and should be gently persuaded to re-adopt it .
All these things are true , but they are not an excuse . Even stupid , impulsive , misguided people have moral responsibility . They have to be called on the game , every time , and condemned , every time .

I grew up with an open-minded Mother who owned a bookstore . This gave me the rare childhood advantage of having any book I wanted , free of charge . Yes , it was a sweet deal and a great way to grow up , but would n't you know , I was obsessed with Stephen King even as a child , and would always gravitate towards their books .
My Mom is cool and open-minded so they were just happy their 12-year-old son was reading 400-page books , but the impact those Stephen King books had on me is far-reaching . Hell , I am a writer now who loves to write horror so really , the man changed my life . That , and the simple fact that their new It adaptation will be hitting theaters this month got me thinking . Why do n't I re-tread on the best Stephen King books of all time , and put those suckers in list form for the masses ? Let 's be honest here , horror literature does n't get much better than Stephen King , real talk .
And that , my faithful readers , is what brings us here today . Again , keep in mind , there are all held in high regard and this list is in no particular numeric order despite being numbered . And do n't worry , WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE…
Let 's get on with the best Stephen King novels that should be on your bookshelves ( or Kindle or whatever ) .
Best Stephen King books everyone needs to read
I bet you are shocked to see this on an inclusion of Stephen King books because you expected ALL HORROR , but the thing is , outside of Ray Bradbury , Stephen King has the BEST BOOK ABOUT WRITING FOR WRITERS EVER MADE !
I read this and am now a writer for a living . If that does n't stand as a burning testimonial to the power of this book , nothing will .
It is also super cool because it gives you full insight into how they write , why they write the way they do , and what they use for inspiration and drive .
Another King story that is about to be both a movie AND a TV show ( movie is a kind of sequel to the books for those who do n't know , rumor is TV show will be the material from the actual books . )
Regardless , King has done the insane with this series . Melded old-west gunslinger mythology with fantasy , steampunk , and horror elements , and the end result is a wild ride and a universe that King says they are most proud of as a writer .
Basically what you have here is a precursor to the Hunger Games , except it is just boys and instead of arrow fighting they have to do “ The Long Walk ” which is a sort of contest where boys walk for miles and miles for days , while maintaining a constant 4 MPH walk rate ( or they are shot dead ) .
It is a scary glimpse into a future that , once you read , will have your feet sore for days afterward .
Warning :
You will be getting MANY Stephen King anthology books on this list as some of their short form work is EASILY their best ( The Jaunt , anyone ? ) . Full Dark , No Stars is another collection of King 's shorter stories but some of the gems in this book just should not be missed .
What is great about King 's short story collections is , there is a story in each of those that cover every fear . From the simple idea of grieving the loss of a loved one to the boogeyman himself , King is a master at shorter tales that hit just as hard as the long ones , if not harder due to their concise precision .
We all know this story because of the ( really good ) film adaptation of the King novel . A large book in terms of horror literature , Pet Sematary is also a damn scary book . Dealing with grief in a way most would n't think of , this book is Stephen King 's version of the classic The Monkey 's Paw , and the man actually ups the scares and makes the classic horror tale into a modern horror masterpiece that is ALSO a masterclass on guilt and mourning .
And please , do n't even get me started on the Zelda character . Still haunts me , and they were just an ill family member . That is just a small part of what makes Pet Sematary so memorable in so many ways .
Another strange Stephen King book to find on here , let me take a second to explain .
Danse Macabre is Stephen King talking straight to us as themselves about all things horror , from other horror writer 's work to the impact certain scary films have had on their writing . It gives us great insight into a man obsessed with ( and a master of ) horror .
Plus , if YOU like horror in all forms like King and I do , it is just a great read . Like a horror fan spouting over horror , you ca n't beat that with a stick .
Yes , this is that sequel to The Shining which you all heard about and may have rolled your eyes over . But really , if you read it and do n't compare , you will find Doctor Sleep is an absolutely absorbing read .
Danny from the first novel is now grown up and uses their Shining to help the dying , but then some “ psychic vampires ” show up , and the whole thing goes typically batshit insane , but in some spectacular ways that will keep you turning the page .
Seriously , do n't write this off as cheap follow-up cash grab for The Shining . It has it 's own legs to stand on and some great ideas as well .
Here is another one of King 's short story collections from earlier in their career but there are some chunks of gold in this book .
The Mist , Jaunt , The Raft , and Gramma are just some of the classics contained in this volume , and if nothing else , read THE JAUNT if you never have and get ready to have a super short story f * ck with your head for the rest of your life .
Really , many consider the Jaunt to be King 's scariest work .
What ? Another volume of Stephen King short stories right after listing a book about their short stories ? Yes , and here is why :
Jerusalem 's Lot ( precursor to the amazing Salem 's Lot ) , Night Surf ( one of my fave King stories ) , Trucks , The Ledge , Lawnmower Man , Children of the Corn AND Quitter INC. ( which is the BEST story about trying to quit cigarettes ever written ) .
This is a tome of King cult classics .
Remember that one episode of The Twilight Zone where the kid could control fate and all the adults around them had to do what they said or they would kill them or turn them into dolls and shit like that ? Well , that episode of TZ fucked King up as a child enough that they kinda decided to stretch the idea into a full book .
On concept alone , this one is worth a read , and has some insane moments you will not forget .
11 ) Rage
This one is super controversial and if I was a shitty journalist , I would not be telling you to read a book that King themselves had pulled from circulation , and I especially would n't include the audiobook , as I did above .
So why did they pull it , you wonder ? Stephen King being a man who holds back for no one and nothing ?
Because it is about a young man who kills two teachers and takes over a classroom . Written long before Columbine and other such massacres , it gives truly chilling insight into the mindset of why someone may do that , and King was scared it would influence future shooters , so they had it pulled .
But if you can get your hands on it , give it a read . This may be a scary story , but it is also our world now .
Misery was the ONE out of all the Stephen King books I read in ONE SITTING . 7 hours , and it was because I was at in-school suspension ( that is when my old school would suspend you but make you stay silent in one room for eight hours in the school rather than actually suspending you and letting you have fun and play video games at home ) .
I would sit there the whole time and just read . In this case , we all know this book well because of the great film that it spawned , but believe it or not , the book is WAY more messed up .
Put it this way , they do not break their foot in the book . That is “ cake ” compared to what they do to them in the book for trying to escape .
Read it , trust me , impossible to put down .
I had to include Different Seasons in this list for one simple reason :
The Body .
The Stephen King story that went on to become the movie Stand By Me , which went on to define my childhood . The Body is a simple coming-of-age tale about some close childhood friends ( who wo n't always remain that way , as we all know ) going on an adventure to find the dead body of classmate rumored to be in the woods .
Is it bleak , yes , but it is also one of the most honest reads about young men ever published . They are imperfect and flawed and fragile , and we feel that with every turning page . We think it is a story about some kids and a dead body but really , it is requiem on the loss of innocence and that is what makes it so powerful and ageless .
Of all the horror characters King has created , none have stuck with the masses quite the way Pennywise the clown from It has . Maybe it has to do with Tim Curry 's whacky 90 's performance . Maybe it has to do with the fact that coulrophobia ( fear of clowns ) is at an all-time high , but either way , the relentlessness of Pennywise in It and the fact that no child is safe from the reaches of their evil is truly unsettling .
Plus , there is a kid-orgy in this book that it 's safe to say wo n't make it to the final movie . That and a cosmic turtle . No really , go read this shIT if you have n't . It is scary and unforgettable in every way .
Let 's hope this new movie can do it the justice the silly mini-series could not .
Listen , we all know the world will probably end due to some outbreak eventually ( possibly as the result of warfare ) , so The Stand makes a great read to kind of set you up for what a plague may do to us one day .
But man , break up with your significant other and quit your job because this book takes so long to read it is not so much reading as it is a three-month lifestyle choice you have to commit to .
Worth it , though .
The story ended up coming out as the movie Silver Bullet ( a REALLY decent werewolf movie , actually ) but it has a crazy backstory . This was n't even going to be a book . It had twelve pieces of art and was supposed to be a calendar ( of the same name ) with a chapter and piece of art going with each month as opposed to a page with dates .
The calendar idea did not work out and they released it is sort of a book/graphic novel hybrid that is a freaking stellar werewolf tale ( with a nice little twist ) and the art in the book is jaw-dropping .
While I will admit that Four Past Midnight is not as good as their other horror collections , this one ( featuring four stories as a follow-up to the prior mentioned Four Seasons ) still has some really strong writing and gives King a little more freedom to get weird with their work .
Just please , for all that is sacred , NEVER WATCH THE TV ADAPTATION INCLUDED ABOVE OF THE LANGOLIERS FROM THIS BOOK .
NEVER !
While not many Stephen King fans would expect this book to be on this list , that is exactly why it is on this list .
Eyes of the Dragon was King 's first real attempt at writing full-on Game of Thrones style fantasy , and you know , it may not be Thrones level of intrigue , but it makes for an easy read and tells exactly what you would want from a fantasy novel . Dragons and shit , you know ?
If nothing else , read it to really understand how versatile this man 's writing truly is . They can do anything . This and Shawshank and Hearts in Atlantis prove that .
This one may draw some heat from diehards , but the opening scene in The Cell book is one of King 's strongest openings EVER . Think of every zombie nightmare you have ever had , up that times ten , and you have the stellar opening to the book about a signal that goes through people 's cell phones and makes them into utter , unstoppable psychos .
It is actually a rumination on how technology and our cell phones are making us all into zombies who can not think for ourselves , but this is Stephen King so you know they drive those messages home in a very unique ( and often bloody ) way .
The movie sucks , though , even though the cast was fantastic . Stick with the book .
The next two entries will be recent short story collections from the Master of Horror . I will start with Bazaar for one reason :
Batman and Robin Have An Altercation .
Yes , that is the name of the story and it deals with Alzheimer 's ( an issue hitting my family hard right now ) in a very poignant way and doles out a very powerful ending . The book itself is not their best short story work ( that we will see directly below ) but it is worth a read for that story alone .
Although King-heads will say their older short story collections are their best work , I would argue that Everything 's Eventual is up there . First of all , it was the first time they made a sort of “ Director 's Cut ” of one of their books . This means there are notes at the beginning and end of the stories that tell you why they wrote them orwhat inspiredd him . Very cool touch that connects you to the work more .
Speaking of the work , Everything 's Eventual has SO MANY great modern King classics :
Autopsy Room Four , The Man in the Black Suit , the Road Virus Heads North , 1408 , and Lunch at Gotham Cafe ( another Batman shout out , but this time in name alone ) .
Those above stories are as good as anything the man has ever written . Read them and tell me I am wrong .
The best vampire book ever written ( and the original is the scariest TV movie ever made ) .
I do n't even need to say more than that . This book ruined me as a kid . Hell , it is still just as scary a read . Fuck sparkling vampires , Salem 's Lot is how vampires need to be thought of .
You know the movie , and the movie was a pretty decent adaptation to this story they wrote under the Richard Bachman pseudonym .
A sort of live-or-die game show run by the elite , the movie was good but the story obviously delves MUCH deeper than the film did , expanding that concept greatly .
Another short story collection but one that is sizably larger than those that came before it , N & D contains 24 new King tales that all balance out to create what is essentially the book form of a dope mixtape .
A couple highlights include :
You Know They Got A Hell Of a Band ( one of my favorite high-concept King stories ) , Crouch End ( which is VERY H.P Lovecraft ) , and The Night Flier . A story about a vampire who flies an old Red Baron style plane .
Crazy shit , but that does n't make it any less enjoyable to read . Speaking of crazy , need to end this list right… ..
Perhaps Stephen King 's best book ever , even if you have seen Kubrick 's Shining AND you 've seen King 's own TV remake , you STILL NEED TO READ THIS BOOK . It is so much more than either adaption offers .
We get so much insight into Jack Torrence and their past and where they are going mentally , but you also get something crucial you do n't really see in either version , which is Jack fighting their downward spiral for the sake of their son and wife .
They are a man becoming a monster and fighting it but not winning , and that is what makes The Shining so profound , and ultimately , Stephen King 's masterwork .

WARSAW—President Donald Trump arrives in Warsaw on Wednesday for their first visit to Poland as President . And while the Polish government is pulling out all the stops—dragooning “ fans ” from across the country and reportedly enlisting Catholic clergy to give Trump the kind of ecstatic welcome they crave—Trump 's visit inevitably will fan the flames of a highly polarized political and social environment here .
The kind of right-wing populism that Team Trump once thought would sweep through the European Union and tear it apart has been defeated at the polls in Austria , the Netherlands , and France over the last few months . But it remains strong , in power , and increasingly authoritarian here in the East .
Law and Justice ( PiS ) , the country 's ruling party , reportedly used a December 2016 meeting with Trump 's cybersecurity advisor Rudy Giuliani to lobby for a visit from the new President . The follow through to actually get them to Warsaw is being touted as a huge PR win for the party , but the celebrations are n't being felt throughout Poland 's parliament , the Sejm .
In what 's either a shocking oversight , or an effort to keep opposition leaders away , the leader of the left wing Nowoczesna ( Modern ) party , Ryszard Petru , told one of the country 's largest publications , Rzeczpospolita , that they only received an invite for Trump 's visit after receiving word from the U.S. embassy .
PiS came to power in 2015 and although their election campaign was relatively moderate and centrist , their political maneuvering since then has caused considerable political and societal chaos . Their actions have not only dismayed many within the country , but also outside partners , especially within the European Union , to which the country owes a large part of its modern success .
Poland entered the European Union in 2004 and the relationship has been widely regarded as very beneficial , but PiS and its supporters see the situation in a different light . While the statistics show that as a whole Poland has experienced rather astonishing economic growth during its time in the E.U. , PiS 's support base , which largely stems from rural regions , believes that the E.U . has exploited Polish workers , caused a massive outflow of skilled Poles to the U.K. , and sacrificed the interests of Polish businesses for those of German companies .
While this rhetoric shows no sign of slowing down , neither does Poland 's economy , posting the strongest growth of any country in central and eastern Europe in the first four months of 2017 .
One of the drivers of that growth was a commitment to the European project , necessitating a focus on the rule of law , independent monetary policy , robust competition , free press , and democracy . However , the government 's actions and words , spearheaded by its leader in all but title , Jaroslaw Kaczynski , have partners across the E.U. , including Polish-born President of the E.U . Council Donald Tusk , worried that the PiS has thrown that commitment to the wind in favor of right-wing populism .
But one thing is for certain , their commitment to courting President Trump , who seems to align with many of their eurosceptic and anti-immigrant viewpoints , seems steadfast . So much so that , recently , one of the country 's top liberal publications , Gazeta Wyborcza , revealed that PiS had asked each of its members of parliament to invite 50 people to the president 's speech on Thursday in Krasinski Square , the site of the monument of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis .
The party is hoping the 300 PiS members can help rope together a crowd of several thousand to meet Trump in Warsaw . In order to bring in these fans from across the various Polish regions , the party will be financing free transportation for all willing participants . The PiS reportedly used its notorious influence with the Catholic Church as well to ask priests to encourage parishioners to make the trip .
One of PiS 's members of parliament , Grzegorz Puda , posted the request to their official Facebook page , indicating that the roughly 230-mile bus ride from their constituency is free but seats are limited . The move to pad numbers will likely be appreciated by the American president , who lashed out after media reports stated the actual size of their inauguration crowd was far smaller than he 'd claimed .
The visit will come on the heels of a New York Times op-ed by Polish journalist , Bartosz T. Wielinski , which paints an ominous picture of the Polish government and has caused widespread vitriolic backlash amongst pro-PiS commentators on the country 's heavily controlled public broadcasters .
In the piece , Wielinski argues that “ Poland began abandoning the path of democracy and the rule of law ” after the PiS took power in late 2015 , and specifically called out the country 's state-run media for producing “ pure propaganda ” that paints the opposition , as well as the European Union as a whole , in a negative light .
On Wednesday , Wielinski tweeted a clip showing how public broadcasters have responded to their op-ed . In it , on-air personalities are seen proclaiming Wielinski 's op-ed “ black PR , ” full of lies , unpatriotic and an attempt to undermine Poland . In one interview , the subjects refused to even state their name , claiming they simply are not worthy of it .
The battle Wielinski finds themselves in is reminiscent of the American media environment , where those who report facts that run contrary to the narratives put out by the Trump administration are dismissed as liars or worse .
In a highly polarized country , on an increasingly polarized continent , Trump 's words , whatever they may be on Thursday , will no doubt carry significant weight . Given their track record , it seems unlikely that President Trump would shame the PiS for their actions , as President Barack Obama did in the summer of 2016 . On the contrary , PiS officials expect the visit to be an endorsement of their domestic and European policies which clashed with Brussels and Berlin .
“ It 's obvious to all observers . Everybody sees the visit in this way , ” says Adam Bielan , a PiS senator and a right hand man of the country 's de facto ruler , party chairperson Jaroslaw Kaczynski . “ The Germans , the Americans , even diplomats from Asia . The panicked articles in the German press just prove this . ”
“ Based on what we 've heard so far , ” said Bielan , “ the speech is going to be everything we wanted . Trump will underscore the importance of Polish-American friendship , they are going to strengthen our historical narrative of Polish heroism during World War II , and issue a ringing endorsement of the Three Seas Initiative , ” a conference among the eastern members of the E.U .
What Trump will actually say is anyone 's guess , but Michal Baranowski from the German Marshall Fund tells The Daily Beast that they believe the president 's address has been largely written by deputy national security adviser Dina Powell , who is seen as a moderate voice within the administration . Baranowski 's belief is that Powell was tasked with writing the speech in order to ensure that Trump does n't inflame already tense relations with German Chancellor Angela Merkel prior to their visit to Hamburg for the G20 summit later in the week .
“ The National Security Council officials understand the risk of using the Warsaw speech to hit out against Germany , ” says Baranowski . “ Creating divisions within Europe would be bad for Poland , the alliance and good for [ Russian President Vladimir ] Putin. ” They add however , that given Trump 's eccentricity nothing can be certain , as was evidenced by the debacle of the president 's NATO speech in Brussels .
Indeed , a new report has surfaced on the eve of the visit , suggesting that the speech will very much be what Merkel and others in the West have feared , and will draw the contrast between nationalist Poland and the globalist outlook of the Western European leaders . The architect of the alt-right version of the speech is reported to be Stephen Miller .
“ If this happens , it may actually be worse than Brussels , ” predicts Baranowski .
But , fresh off the bus , there will be quite a crowd to cheer them on .
Sweet : Cubs at the White House — a made-for-Chicago Obama finale

WASHINGTON — Now we know how the story ends .
President Barack Obama 's last event at the White House was a rollicking good time , honoring the Chicago Cubs on Monday for winning the 2016 World Series .
Obama 's team has spent months planning their final days , and then they were tossed this wonderful curveball . As soon as the Cubs beat the Indians in the 10th inning at 12:47 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 3 , Obama sent a tweet inviting them to the White House .
The Cubs organization and the White House scrambled to make sure the Chicago president applauded the Chicago Cubs on their watch .
“ Let 's Go Cubbies ” everyone in the East Room chanted in that distinctive singsong as Obama entered , as if they were at Wrigley Field or a saloon .
“ They said this day would never come , ” Obama said with relish , even though they root for the White Sox .
“ Here is something none of my predecessors ever got a chance to say : Welcome to the White House the World Series Champion , Chicago Cubs !
OPINION
“ I will say to the Cubs : It took you long enough . I mean , I 've only got four days left . You 're just making it under the wire .
“ Now , listen , I made a lot of promises in 2008 . We 've managed to fulfill a large number of them . But even I was not crazy enough to suggest that during these eight years we would see the Cubs win the World Series . But I did say that there 's never been anything false about hope . Hope — the audacity of hope , ” Obama said , invoking the title of their best-selling book .
What a send-off , just days before Obama 's term ends at noon on Friday .
He 's done tons of events in the East Room these past eight years , and now this was it . What a made-for-Chicago finale .
The East Room was packed . Everyone there who was n't a player or connected to the Cubs had to be a somebody or have some clout to get in . By that I mean people who knew people at the Obama White House .
Mayor Rahm Emanuel , Obama 's first chief of staff , was in a front row , sitting next to their younger brother , Ari , the Hollywood agent . The AP has reported that Ari and Obama have talked about things they might do in their post-presidency .
Among those present from the elected world : Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan , with daughter Rebecca ; first-year student Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi , D-Ill. , and their son , Vijay ; Rep. Mike Quigley , D-Ill. ; Rep. Randy Hultgren , R-Ill. ; Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill. ; former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood ; former White House Senior Adviser David Axelrod , with their son , Ethan ; State Rep. Sara Feigenholtz , D-Chicago .
Quigley and Feigenholtz feel a bit proprietary about the Cubs , because Wrigley Field is in their respective North Side districts .
The mood was giddy , tinged with bittersweet — but not for everybody , because there were Republicans in the room .
President-elect Donald Trump tapped Cubs board member Todd Ricketts to be their deputy Commerce secretary . Cubs board chair Tom is a fellow conservative . Their sister , Cubs board member Laura Ricketts , is a big-time Democratic donor and fundraiser who has been with Obama since they ran for the Senate , and a major Hillary Clinton supporter .
Laura Ricketts is the lone Democrat in a powerful Republican family — brother Pete is the GOP governor of Nebraska and the Ricketts kids parents , Marlene and Joe Ricketts , are mega donors to GOP and conservative candidates and causes .
“ We 're just glad we were able to get this organized , ” Laura Ricketts told me . “ It 's hard to get all the players together. ” After the “ long , arduous , emotional season for them , they scattered to the winds to relax after the season was over . Glad with the president 's busy schedule and the tight time frame , we could work this out . ”
Kim Grimshaw Bolton and their brother , Chris Grimshaw , were determined to be among those present . For many years , their folks , longtime civic activists Jacquelyne and Bill Grimshaw — Bill passed away in March — lived in the house next to the Obamas on South Greenwood . Michelle Obama 's chief of staff , Tina Tchen , is a longtime friend of Kim 's mom , and they got them in .
Said Bolton , “ This president was a close friend of my family and this team has been such a part of my growing up and my family . To be here and have this be their last official event is extraordinary . ”

MOG THE CAT – the creation of author Judith Kerr – is being tipped to take the crown for Sainsbury 's in the battle of the UK Christmas ads .
The beloved character starred in 15 titles from 1970 – but was killed off by the writer in 2002 , dying of old age .
The new ad , which is three-and-a-half minutes long ( an epic by TV advertising standards ) depicts the cat enduring a sequence of highly improbable and unfortunate events in the early hours of Christmas morning , before the Thomas family are awake .
In the midst of the chaos , Mog somehow succeeds in contacting the local fire station , unwittingly kick-starting a mission to save Christmas ( hurrah ! ) .
The ad debuted across multiple channels at 7.15pm last night . An accompanying book by Kerr and soft toy are also going on sale at the supermarket , and funds raised are going to Save the Children .
I recently had the opportunity to speak with Executive Producer of the third season of Twin Peaks , Sabrina Sutherland . Sabrina has been the site before ( Lynching Television ( again ) – a conversation with Sabrina Sutherland about Twin Peaks : The Return By Andreas Halskov ) and I really appreciated them agreeing to come back and talk to us again . This time we spoke of their overall experience working on the show , their relationship with David Lynch , the acclaim the show is receiving and much more . Hope you enjoy the interview !
25YL : You worked with David on the second season of Twin Peaks , On the Air , Hotel Room and also on two of their features ( Lost Highway and Inland Empire ) prior to the return to Twin Peaks . How did your relationship with David grow and change over the years ?
SS : It grew and changed based on the job that I did . I would be working directly for someone else , whether it be Deepak Nayer who was the producer that now I am for David . Our relationship changed based on what I was doing . I 've been working with them exclusively since the end of 2008 and I do a lot of other things besides production within their company . Our relationship has changed and I get more responsibility and you have a different working relationship that way .
25YL : Can we talk about the position you took in 2008 more ?
SS : In 2008 they had me come in to look at different things in their company for whatever reason . They obviously knew who I was . We had been doing some commercials – they do a lot of other things besides film and TV . I was the production manager for the commercials they were doing at the time and I guess they just liked the work that I did . They had me come in and look at some other things they were doing . So I started working with them only because they do so many things . They have such a wide variety of interests and work and it really became a full-time job . Rather than being a person for hire I became a member of their staff to help with all the different things they did .
25YL : At what point were you made aware that work on Twin Peaks had begun ?
SS : They and Mark had been meeting for a while . Nothing had been said as to specifically why that was happening but just being there you knew something was happening . At one point David called me in and said we 're writing and we want to bring Twin Peaks back . They wanted me to read over what they had and talk to them and come up with a budget and a schedule and put a proposal together to go to a company to raise money for it .
25YL : I 've always had this vision of your job during the production of Twin Peaks being 24 hours a day with a checklist a mile long . What all did your job entail from when you first learned of the project until today ?
SS : I will say that it did kind of take over my life for the whole time ( laughs ) . At that time nothing had been solidified . Ideas were flowing and there was some stuff written down . I think they gave me two kinds of parts , two things they were thinking could be episodes if it had to be television . It was n't really thought of that way by David though in terms of the scope of it . It was this film and here were two sections of it . I was asked to do a budget and project what it would be like for the whole show off these two parts . It was a lot of discussion at that point rather than hard facts . As time went on , we had something completed and then it was onto pre-production and getting all of David 's ideas to everyone and making sure everyone was on the same wave length in terms of work . Then shooting the whole thing started in September of 2015 and we finished in April of 2016 . We went right into post production from there and that lasted a year . It 's working pretty much seven days a week and a lot of hours every day . Once we finished post production it went to delivery , which is getting everything put together for the different countries and broadcasts and from there it was onto the Blu Ray/ DVD sets . There 's just a lot of work . It 's just now that I can finally kind of take a breath and say “ Ok , we 're almost done ” . Then as soon as I took a breath I got sick ( laughs ) . I think I had held onto my trying to be able to finish everything and kept my body in check and then as soon as I could relax , I got sick . That 's where I 'm at now , just getting over being sick .
25YL : Are you able to enjoy finally being able to take a breath now ?
SS : Kind of . There 's always stuff going on . Now I 'm back to the job I had prior to Twin Peaks . I 'm still working on all of these other things that are involved with David 's company . I still have all of this other work I 'm dealing with , which I had to deal with while we were doing Twin Peaks as well . There 's a lot of work to do but it is nice to be a little bit more relaxed for sure .
25YL : Has your work on Twin Peaks been completed with the release of the boxset this week ?
SS : No , there 's more still . Organizing different things , making sure final things are done . It 's not done but it 's very close .
25YL : This week several publications put out their “ Best of 2017 ” lists and Twin Peaks topped many of those lists . The box set is sold out everywhere . What 's it like for you to see this kind of reaction to something you 've dedicated the past several years of your life to ?
SS : I could n't be obviously more happy and proud of the work . This is David 's baby in many ways and I 'm really happy for them and I 'm really happy that I was able to help them get what they wanted . So it 's nice to see the recognition for them in particular .
25YL : I 'm going to speak as a fan for a moment instead of as a journalist . You took on and embraced this role as a person from the inside who spoke daily with the fan community and answered our questions , set the record straight on certain things and kept this open dialogue with us that was truly appreciated by all of us . Knowing how hard you worked behind the scenes and how engaged you were with us , a lot of this credit and recognition belongs to you as well .
SS : Thank you for saying that , that was really nice to hear . I 'm a huge fan myself . That 's the reason I started working on the show myself is because I saw the first season and called to see if I could work on the show . Being a fan , you know what people want , you do n't want to have someone giving you bullshit and you want a straight answer . I will say that I hear and see a lot of comments that are totally wrong that I do n't correct just because I do n't want to do that all the time . There are some things that I can say “ No , wait a minute , this is really the right thing ” I like to do that because as a fan I would like to know what the reality is .
25YL : What has your experience with the fan community been like ?
SS : I love the fan community . I am one of the fans so I appreciate when someone is really passionate about something and wants to know things . Of course , I ca n't agree with a lot things that people may say or ask about just because I know what David 's point of view is on those things . I always try to be respective of what they want . I think as far as fans go , I think the fans are great and are diverse and have different opinions and that 's great . If it was n't for the fans , I know – not I think , I know – there would n't have been this new series . That 's how important the fans are .
25YL : Any funny stories from set you care to share ?
SS : David has a huge sense of humor . They make me laugh all the time . Michael ( David 's assistant ) , David and I would drive to the set together every day and then drive home together every night . It gave me a chance to go over things with David privately . Most locations were anywhere from a half hour to hour ride . So it gave us plenty of time to talk . Some of those car rides… . I 'd be crying I 'd be laughing so hard . He 's just so funny . Working with them onset ; people love working with him . He 's just a really great person to work with . That always brings a smile to my face too . You want to have a happy crew .
25YL : It 's been said that the cast and crew have a family like bond that you do n't typically hear about in the entertainment industry . I 've had cast and crew tell me both on and off the record that you still check on them and talk to them not only about their career but their lives as well .
SS : That 's true . They 're all very close friends . It 's very much like a family . We 're even getting together this weekend to celebrate the holidays and see where everyone is . It 's a lot like having friends from college or that you grew up with that you just want to talk to , see how they 're doing . I have n't had a bad experience with anybody . You feel very close to them and it 's a lot like a family . For me it all comes from David . They make the set open , inviting , friendly and respectful . Everyone is worthwhile and there for a reason . You feel the warmth and love .
25YL : In a completely hypothetical Season 4 , you are picking the musical acts for the Roadhouse . Who plays first ?
SS : Probably Angelo . He 's come in and it would be very interesting with him . I love Angelo and I would want them there the first night .
25YL : What has this experience meant to you personally ?
SS : I feel very proud that I was able to make it all happen . I was able to get what David wanted onto the screen and help with that process . Whether I facilitated , directly did something or talked to someone who talked to somebody else , I 'm just really happy that it 's how they wanted it or as close as we could get to how they wanted it . That to me is very meaningful to me .
25YL : I want to ask you about one rumor . It 's been said that there was at one point a second script or perhaps a vastly different script than what was filmed . Can you debunk that or is there any truth to it ?
SS : There 's always ideas that do n't work out . What Showtime ultimately read is what you saw onscreen , with some additions .
25YL : Thank you so much for not only taking the time to speak with me today but also for everything you 've done . Anything in conclusion you would like to say to those reading this ?
SS : Thank you for your support and hopefully you enjoyed the show and appreciate it for what it is . Leave some room for dreaming rather than having all of the answers given to you . I think that 's really important .
Many thanks to Sabrina for all that she 's done for the Twin Peaks community ! If you enjoyed this interview , please be sure to check out some of our others ! Thanks as always for your support of the site !

Looks like Bernie Kerik 's legal woes are n't going away any time soon .
The former NYC police commissioner and Giuliani crony has been indicted in Washington DC on charges of lying to the Bush White House officials who were vetting them for the job of Homeland Security Secretary ( remember that trainwreck ? ) .Reports CBS2 :
According to the new indictment , Kerik , in 1999 and 2000 when they were NYPD commissioner , spoke to city regulators on behalf of contractors who were seeking one or more permits to do business in and with the city . The contractors then spent more than $ 255,000 renovating Kerik 's apartment in Riverdale . In 2004 , when Kerik was under consideration by the White House for the Homeland Security position , they gave false and misleading answers to questions by White House officials about their relationship with the contractors . The indictment alleges that Kerik falsely denied that there was any possible concern the president should have about their relationship with the contractors , and that as a public official they had had any financial dealings with individuals seeking to do business with the City . It also alleges Kerik sent an e-mail to a White House official containing false and misleading statements concerning the renovations to the apartment in Riverdale .
Kerik is facing a broader case in New York . Similar false statement charges had been brought in that case , but were transferred to Washington since that 's where the alleged crime occurred .

The Cally 40 Year Old – the oldest expression bottled from the mothballed Edinburgh distillery – makes its first appearance in the Special Releases range this year with a price tag of £750 .
Dr Nick Morgan , head of whisky outreach at Diageo , said this year 's Special Releases is particularly special .
‘ We have a real variety of whiskies from distilleries which have been un-earthed by our talented master blenders , such as The Cally , ' they said . ‘ Once again , the Special Releases range has surpassed expectations and we 're thrilled to share the collection with whisky experts everywhere . '
Joining The Cally in the nine-strong range are a £2,400 32-year-old Port Ellen – the distillery 's 15th appearance in the Special Releases , a 37-year-old Brora priced at £1,300 – the oldest bottling in the range to-date , and a second bottling of no-age-statement Clynelish Select Reserve .
The former made its first appearance in the collection last year , and features liquid aged for at least 15 years .
In addition , the 2015 series also includes a Caol Ila 17 ( £90 ) , a Dailuaine 34 ( £380 ) – the first bottling from the distillery for the Special Releases in six years , a Dalwhinnie 25 ( £325 ) , Lagavulin 12 ( £80 ) , and Pittyvaich 25 ( £250 ) from the now closed Speyside distillery .

After Transparent director Jill Soloway won their second Emmy in a row for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series , they took to the stage with an excellent Gucci pantsuit and a rallying cry to match .
“ When you take women , people of color , trans people , queer people and you put them at the center of the story , the subjects instead of the objects , you change the world , we found out , ” Soloway said . “ [ What ] these people call television I call a revolution , ” they added .
Soloway also thanked the trans community , called for a stop to the killings of trans women , and ended by shouting , “ Topple the patriarchy , topple the patriarchy ! , ” and jumping up and down .
“ I 'm trying to figure out if ‘ topple the patriarchy ' is a good thing for me or not . I do n't think it is , ” Jimmy Kimmel joked when they got back onstage . Nah , probably not .
Three days ago the Prime Minister elect 's cat Paddles appeared on the Twitter scene , and people have no idea who 's behind the account .
Paddles , a ginger and white cat with opposable thumbs , has proven to be a prolific social media user and has fired off hundreds of tweets in a matter of days .
The cat 's Twitter bio says they are an `` Independent cat- not affurliated with the Labour pawty '' .
Prime Minister-Elect Jacinda Ardern has batted down speculation it 's run by their partner Clarke Gayford .
`` There is indeed an account in the name of my cat and I have no idea who has created it . ''
However Ardern says it has provided a good source of amusement for them and their partner .
`` I am quite happy for that person to continue logging on behalf of Paddles , keeping in mind Paddles has thumbs , I ca n't put it past them it 's their own account as well , ''
`` She 's a polydactyl , '' Ardern says .
For reference a `` polydactyl '' is a cat with extra claws that look like opposable thumbs .
The feline has been officially greeted by 'Diplo Dog ' Gracie Brown , who is US Ambassador to New Zealand Scott Brown 's dog .
The pan-European Stoxx 600 edged up 0.08 percent with sectors and major bourses moving in different directions . The FTSE 100 was up by 0.85 percent following the Bank of England 's decision to keep interest rates unchanged .
Oil and gas stocks led the losses for most of the day amid worse-than-anticipated earnings . Neste reported a narrow miss on profits in the second quarter and shares of the Finnish oil refining firm slipped almost 6 percent .
On the other hand , retail stocks were among the best performing , up by 0.3 percent . British clothing retailer Next posted a return to quarterly sales growth on Thursday , supported by an improvement in product ranges and a spell of warmer weather . The company said full price sales rose 0.7 percent in the three months through June . Its shares surged almost 10 percent , hitting the top of the European benchmark .
Looking at individual stocks , Italy 's largest bank by assets , Unicredit reported better-than-expected net profits in the second quarter of 2017 . The lender attributed the uptick in performance to lower costs and a drop in loan-loss charges . Its shares were trading 7 percent higher .
German sportswear firm Adidas , posted another quarter of sales growth in China and North America on Thursday , as it profited from its retro styles and footwear . The firm said its sales grew almost 30 percent in China and around 26 percent in North America , although they fell 11 percent in the Russian market . Shares were slightly higher .
In the U.S. , the Dow hovered at 22,000 supported by further earnings .

The Myth of Japanese Atrocities at Nanking
By C. W. Porter
The tropical landscape of the Tokyo Trial transcript is rich in strange fauna and flora . A variety prevalent on the lowlands of Central China is known for the hypertrophic development of its organs of locomotion and perception , ( particularly hearing ) . They are called the Universal Witness .
Despite its name , ( Ah See in Chinese ) , the vision of this specimen is quite poor .
Like the Indestructible Witness , the Universal Witness is immune to shooting , bayonetting , and other forms of capital punishment ; however , the Universal Witness is everywhere and sees everything ; they see though doors , walls , and obstacles .
I SAW JAP ATROCITIES IN 12 CITIES AND WAS BAYONETTED TEN TIMES BUT ONLY HAVE ONE SCAR
I was the eye-witness ... in such places as ( list of 12 Chinese place names ) ... many others were killed in various other places ... ten Japanese stabbed the left side of my abdomen with bayonets ... The scar on the left side of my abdomen is an evidence ( pp . 4,650 ) .
( Note : affidavit was written in English in 1946 describing events in China in 1937 , translated orally into Chinese prior to signature ) .
THE JAPS TOOK ME ALONG AS A WITNESS , THATS WHY I SAW SO MANY ATROCITIES
I and another were put to one side , and the Japanese used light machine guns to kill the rest ... I helped throw the bodies in a pond by order of the Japanese ... the same day in the afternoon I saw three Japanese rape a dumb girl ... I was taken by Japanese soldiers again ... they killed with the bayonet ... on the same day in the afternoon I was taken to ... and saw three Japanese soldiers set a fire ... I saw another raping case ...  ( p. 2,609 ) .
( Note : this affidavit was written in English in 1946 describing events in China in 1937 , complete with names of the Japanese responsible , with the names of their units , and was translated orally from English to Chinese prior to signature ) .
I SAW JAPS HANG AROUND AFTER RAPING
I see with my very eyes the Japanese soldier raping a woman in a bathroom , and their clothes outside , and then afterwards we discovered the bathroom door and found a woman naked and also weeping and downcast ...
Now we went to the camp to try to get ... to catch two Japanese who were reported to be living there ... we saw one Japanese still sitting there , with a woman on the corner and weeping ... and that man was sitting there with their head low there ... once we caught a Japanese raping , and they were naked . They were sleeping ... I know another case where because of the boatman ... they told me this : where they saw that too on their boat , it happened on their boat ... after raping , the Japanese asked the old man in that family , isnt that good ? ... I forgot to say that when the Japanese asked the older man whether it is good or not , they wanted the old man to rape that young girl so all the girls -now I saw this - they all jumped into the river . So the whole family jumped into the river and all drowned . This is not second-hand story . This is real , real and genuine , and we have , we know that , the boatman has been with us for a long time ( pp . 2,569-2,573 ) .
( Note : the witness claimed to have a Ph . D. from the University of Illinois at the age of 13 ) .
I TREATED A BEHEADING VICTIM AND HEARD ABOUT MASS RAPES AT NANKING
I can say the few instances of patients that I treated during the time immediately following the fall of Nanking , but I will not be able to give their names , except in the case of two ... one case ... is that of a young woman of forty , who was brought to the hospital with the back of their neck having a laceration severing all the muscles of their neck , and leaving the head very precariously balanced ... there was no doubt in our minds that the work was that of a Japanese soldier ...
Q : You say that the woman of about 40 had a wound in their neck and the muscles were cut and were hanging loose . But what was this caused by ?
A : A Japanese sword ... ( pp . 2,534 ; 2,552-3 ) .
( Testimony of Dr. Robert O. Wilson ) .
THEY CUT MY HEAD OFF BUT I CRAWLED TO THE HOSPITAL
They attempted to cut off their head . The muscles of the neck had been cut but they failed to sever the spinal cord . They feigned death but dragged themselves to the hospital ... Dr. Wilson is trying to patch them up and thinks they may have a chance to live ...  ( p. 4,476 ) .
Note : this is the same woman . First quotes are from Dr. Wilson . Wilsons hospital at Nanking had 180 beds . Wilson claimed that 500,000 people were in Nanking at this time ; many patients were turned away , but they could not say how many . If the Japanese injured 200 people , Wilsons testimony is true .
Second quote is from mimeographed diary of James H. McCallum ; McCallum was an unknown person who did not appear to testify ; one of the American defense attorneys had defended a James H. McCallum on a charge of mail fraud in Ohio ; the defendant jumped bail and was never caught . It was never learned whether this was the same James H. McCallum ) .
HOW THE JAPS KILLED 200,000 OR MAYBE 260,000 OR MAYBE 278,586 OR MAYBE 300,000 OR MAYBE 500,000 AFTER MASS RAPES AT NANKING
 ... approximately 260,000 dead ... over 300,000 victims were reported ... it is believed that over 200,000 more are yet to be confirmed ... more than 200,000 were murdered ... more than 300,000 people killed ... the total number of victims killed totalled - I wish to say there is a typographical error there - the number should read 278,586 ... the total number of bodies buried ... totalled more than 155,300 ...  .
OBJECTION : Mr . Brooks calls my attention to the fact that in another portion of the affidavit is contained the statement that 300,000 were killed in Nanking , and as I understand it the total population of Nanking is only 200,000 ... 
THE PRESIDENT :  ... the judges will be just as vigilant as the defense to see that evidence which is indefinite or vague , or sweeping assertions which are not supported by evidence , are rejected ( pp . 4,537-51 ) .
( Note : the quotes are from two war crimes reports prepared by the Nanking Procurator Generals office in 1946 relating to events of 1937 . Material on which conclusions are based are not attached to the reports . Also included are several reports of burial societies . The reports are quite short .
According to the defense , 20 cases of rape by young recruits were reported to headquarters in Tokyo , 3 trials were held ; 1 officer was executed and 2 soldiers imprisoned . Elsewhere it is stated that up to 100 trials of Japanese soldiers were held ; elsewhere , that 180 cases per week were being reported from possibly hostile sources . One defense witness admitted that atrocities in Nanking were very severe ; what this means in terms of numbers is hard to guess .
Mass rape was a crime allegedly committed by Japanese in all theatres of war as part of a Common Plan . It seems obvious that such a plan would be incompatible with discipline and that any army following such a plan would be immediately defeated .
At the time of these events , the Chinese Nationalists were co-operating with the Communists under the terms of the Shan Agreement to expel the Japanese from China , and the Japanese were the victims of considerable Communist propaganda , not only in China , but elsewhere .
It appears that Japanese atrocities at Nanking ( to the extent to which they have any reality at all ) were a reprisal for Chinese atrocities against Japanese residents in China at Tung Chow on July 29 , 1937 , atrocities which included rape . It was pointed out by the prosecution that murder could be justified on the grounds of reprisal , but that rape could not be .

President Barack Obama brings their campaign to curb gun violence to Minnesota today , and the North Star state offers valuable lessons for a nation in the midst of a critical public debate . If the president can make progress in Minnesota , there is reason to hope they can promote consensus on effective gun-violence prevention measures throughout the nation .
Eric P. Schwartz
Like so many other states , Minnesota recently experienced its own horrific gun violence , when a dismissed employee shot and killed six people at a Minneapolis signage company in September . Police described it as the deadliest case of violence in the workplace since Minnesota authorities began keeping track of the figures in 1992 . The company 's owner , an immigrant who built their business over the course of many decades and had broad ties in the local community , was among the victims , and the killings have had a profound impact on the local debate on gun violence .
That debate is taking place in a state with a strong tradition of gun ownership and strong support for the Second Amendment . Most of Minnesota 's House delegation , including some Democrats , have been unenthusiastic about Obama 's call for an assault-weapons ban . Minnesota 's Democratic governor , Mark Dayton , has taken a cautious approach on gun-violence prevention legislation , noting that while he 's prepared to have a dialogue on proposals , legislative efforts would face constitutional challenges . Even Sens . Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar , who support an assault-weapons ban , have emphasized the right of Minnesotans to own guns . As Klobuchar put it at a hearing several days ago , “ I come from a hunting state ; the last thing I want to do is hurt my Uncle Dick in their deer stand . ”
The affirmation of the right to keep and bear arms is understandable in a state with guns in nearly half of all households , where citizens hunt game species in more than 1400 wildlife refuge areas , and where political leaders have long argued that law-abiding citizens should have access to firearms to protect themselves and their families .
If gun ownership has so much support in this part of the country , just why did the president choose to make Minnesota the first state they would visit in their campaign to press for their proposals ? And what characteristics of this state 's political culture make it a laboratory for efforts to reach a broader consensus countrywide on measures to limit gun violence ?
A history of public-health and -safety laws
First , the state 's strong tradition of gun ownership coexists with a history of broad support for laws regulating public health and public safety . In fact , Minnesota has already enacted modest gun-violence prevention measures , such as regulation of unsafe firearms , provisions to prevent access by children to firearms , and state background checks in certain instances . While these have been criticized as inadequate , they go further than gun-violence prevention measures in most other states , and they have been implemented without injury to the interests of Minnesota 's gun owners .
Second , as Obama has indicated , law-enforcement leaders have critical roles to play in the debate on gun violence , and their meeting with senior Minnesota police officials in Washington in January reflected the deep engagement of Minnesota 's law-enforcement community . That was also evident last year , when Gov . Dayton vetoed proposed state legislation that would have expanded the permissible use of deadly force by private citizens . The opposition by state police and sheriffs ' associations played a key role in the debate , and offers a valuable lesson on the benefits of coalition building with law-enforcement officials on means to reduce gun violence .
Polling shows support for assault-weapons ban
Third , a recent Public Policy Polling survey suggests that a majority of Minnesotans now support an assault-weapons ban . While polls have indicated that Americans support this and a range of other gun-violence prevention measures endorsed by the president , the numbers for Minnesota are significant , and create the possibility of political shifts in other states that strongly support gun ownership .
Finally , and notwithstanding the polarization and partisanship in Minnesota and the nation in recent years , Minnesota is a state with a long history of civility in its politics , and strong efforts to reach bipartisan consensus on contentious issues . With a range of new state legislative proposals on gun violence , from expanded background checks to limits on magazine capacity for firearms to a ban on assault weapons , that tradition will be tested in Minnesota .
The quality of Minnesota 's debate will help set the tone for discussions in other states and around the country , with critical implications for public safety in the months and years to come .

WebAssembly is a new binary format for compilation to the web . It is in the process of being designed and implemented as we speak , in collaboration among the major browser vendors . Things are moving quickly ! In this post we 'll show some of our recent progress with a deep dive into the toolchain side of WebAssembly .
For WebAssembly to be usable , we need two major components : toolchains that compile code into WebAssembly , and browsers that can execute that output . Both of those components depend on progress in finishing the WebAssembly spec , but otherwise are largely separate engineering efforts . This separation is a good thing , as it will enable compilers to emit WebAssembly that runs in any browser , and browsers to run WebAssembly no matter which compiler generated it ; in other words , it allows multiple toolchains and multiple browsers to work together , improving user choice . The separation also allows work on the two components to proceed in parallel right now .
A new project on the toolchain side of WebAssembly is Binaryen . Binaryen is a compiler infrastructure library for WebAssembly , written in C++ . If you 're not working on a WebAssembly compiler yourself , you 'll probably never need to know anything about it , but if you use a WebAssembly compiler then it might use Binaryen for you under the hood ; we 'll see examples of that later .
At Binaryen 's core is a modular set of classes that can parse and emit WebAssembly , as well as represent it in an AST designed for writing flexible transformation passes on . Built on top of that are several useful tools :
The Binaryen shell , which can load a WebAssembly module , transform it , execute it in an interpreter , print it , etc . Loading and printing use WebAssembly 's current temporary s-expression format , which has the suffix .wast ( work is underway on designing the WebAssembly binary format , as well as the final text format , but they are n't ready yet ) .
which can load a WebAssembly module , transform it , execute it in an interpreter , print it , etc . Loading and printing use WebAssembly 's current temporary s-expression format , which has the suffix .wast ( work is underway on designing the WebAssembly binary format , as well as the final text format , but they are n't ready yet ) . asm2wasm , which compiles asm.js into WebAssembly .
, which compiles asm.js into WebAssembly . wasm2asm , which compiles WebAssembly into asm.js . ( This is a work in progress . )
, which compiles WebAssembly into asm.js . ( This is a work in progress . ) s2wasm , which compiles .s files , in the format emitted by the new WebAssembly backend being developed in LLVM , to WebAssembly .
, which compiles .s files , in the format emitted by the new WebAssembly backend being developed in LLVM , to WebAssembly . wasm.js , a port of Binaryen itself to JavaScript . This lets us run all the above components on a web page or any other JavaScript environment .
For a general overview of Binaryen , you can see these slides from a talk I recently gave . Do n't skip slide # 9 : )
It 's important to note that WebAssembly is still in the design phase , and the formats that Binaryen can read and write ( .wast , .s ) are not final . Binaryen has been constantly updating with those changes ; the rate of churn is decreasing , but expect breakage .
Let 's discuss some of the specific areas where Binaryen can be helpful .
Compiling to WebAssembly using Emscripten
Emscripten can compile C and C++ to asm.js , and Binaryen 's asm2wasm tool can compile asm.js to WebAssembly , so together Emscripten+Binaryen provide a complete way to compile C and C++ to WebAssembly . You can run asm2wasm on asm.js code directly ( it can be run on the commandline ) , but it 's easiest to let Emscripten do it for you , using something like
emcc file.cpp -o file.js -s ‘ BINARYEN= ” path-to-binaryen ” '
Emscripten will compile file.cpp , and emit a main JavaScript file and a separate file for the WebAssembly output , in .wast formatted . Under the hood , Emscripten compiles to asm.js , then runs asm2wasm on the asm.js file to produce the .wast filed . For more details , see the Emscripten wiki page on WebAssembly .
But wait , what good is it to compile to WebAssembly when browsers do n't support it yet ? Good question : ) Yes , we do n't want to ship this code since browsers ca n't run it . But it is still very useful for testing purposes : we want to know that Emscripten can compile properly to WebAssembly as soon as we can , since we do n't want to wait on browser support .
But how can we check that Emscripten is in fact compiling properly to WebAssembly , if we ca n't run it ? For that , we can use wasm.js , which Emscripten integrated into our output .js file when we ran that emcc command before . wasm.js contains portions of Binaryen compiled to JavaScript , including the Binaryen interpreter . If you run file.js ( in node.js , or on a web page ) then what happens is the interpreter will execute that WebAssembly . That lets us actually verify that the compiled WebAssembly code does the right thing . You can see an example of such a compiled program here , and there are some more builds for testing purposes in the build suite repo .
Of course , we are not quite on as solid ground as we would like , given this weird testing environment : a C++ program compiled to WebAssembly , running in a WebAssembly interpreter itself compiled from C++ to JavaScript , and no other way to run the program yet . But we have a few reasons to be confident in the results :
This output passes the Emscripten test suite . That includes many real-world codebases ( Python , zlib , SQLite , etc . ) as well as lots of unit tests for corner cases in C and C++ . Experience has shown that when that test suite is passed , it 's very likely that other code will work too .
The Binaryen interpreter passes the WebAssembly spec test suite , indicating that it is running WebAssembly properly . In other words , when browsers get native support , they should run it in the same way ( except much faster ! this code is running in a simple intepreter for testing purposes , so it 's very slow ; but note that there is work in progress on fast ways to polyfill ) .
This output was generated using Emscripten , which is a stable compiler used in production , and a relatively small amount of code on top of that in Binaryen ( just a few thousand lines ) . The less new code , the less risk of bugs .
Overall , this indicates that we are in good shape here , and can compile C and C++ to WebAssembly today using Emscripten + Binaryen , even if browsers ca n't run it yet .
Note that aside from emitting WebAssembly , the builds that we emit in this mode use everything else from the Emscripten toolchain normally : Emscripten 's port of the musl libc and syscalls to access it , OpenGL/WebGL code , browser integration code , node.js integration code , and so forth . As a result , this supports everything Emscripten already does , and existing projects using Emscripten can switch to emitting WebAssembly with just the flip of a switch . This is a key part of letting existing C++ projects that compile to the web benefit from WebAssembly when it launches , with little or no effort on their part .
Using the new experimental LLVM WebAssembly backend with Emscripten
We just saw an important milestone for Emscripten , in that it can compile to WebAssembly and even test that we get valid output . But things do n't stop there : that was using Emscripten 's current asm.js compiler backend , together with asm2wasm . There is a new LLVM backend for WebAssembly in development directly in the upstream LLVM repository , and while it is n't ready for general use yet , in the long term it will be very important . Binaryen has support for that too .
The LLVM backend , like most LLVM backends , emits assembly code , in this case in a specific .s format . That output is close to WebAssembly , but not identical – it looks more like the output of a C compiler ( linear list of instructions , one instruction per line , etc . ) rather than WebAssembly 's more structured AST . The .s file can be translated into WebAssembly in a fairly straightforward way , though , and Binaryen includes s2wasm , a tool that translates .s to WebAssembly . It can be run standalone on the commandline , but also has Emscripten integration support : Emscripten now has a WASM_BACKEND option , which you can use like this :
emcc file.cpp -o file.js -s ‘ BINARYEN= ” path-to-binaryen ” ' -s WASM_BACKEND=1
( Note that you also need the BINARYEN option , as s2wasm is part of Binaryen . ) When that option is provided , Emscripten uses the new WebAssembly backend instead of the existing asm.js one . After calling the backend and receiving .s from it , Emscripten calls s2wasm to convert that to WebAssembly . Some examples of programs you can build with the new backend are on the Emscripten wiki .
There are , therefore , two ways to compile to WebAssembly using Binaryen : Emscripten + asm.js backend + asm2wasm , which works right now and should be fairly robust and reliable , and Emscripten + new WebAssembly backend + s2wasm , which is not yet fully functional , but as the WebAssembly backend matures it should become a powerful option , and hopefully will replace the asm.js backend in the future . The goal is to make that transition seamless : flipping between the two WebAssembly modes is just a matter of setting an option , as we saw .
The same is also true between asm.js and WebAssembly support in Emscripten , which is also just an option you can set , and the transition there should be seamless as well . In other words , there will be a straight and simple path from
using Emscripten to emit asm.js today , to
using it to emit WebAssembly using asm2wasm ( possible today , but browsers ca n't run it yet ) , to
using it to emit WebAssembly using the new LLVM backend ( once the backend is ready ) .
Each step should provide substantial benefits , with no extra effort for developers .
In closing , note that while this post focused on using Binaryen with Emscripten , at its core it is designed to be a general-purpose WebAssembly library in C++ : If you want to write something toolchain-related with WebAssembly , you probably need code to read WebAssembly , print it out , an AST to operate on , etc. , which Binaryen provides . It was very useful in writing asm2wasm , s2wasm , etc. , and hopefully other projects will find it useful as well .
In an effort to develop a defense mechanism that can reach any target in the world in just an hour , the US Air Force is developing hypersonic weapons , which are currently nearing the testing stage . While the technology is not expected to be fully developed for years , some in the international community are worried about the risks of inadvertent nuclear warfare .
Hypersonic weapons are not new – ballistic missiles are hypersonic – but the US is currently researching a new class of hypersonic weaponry called `` boost-glide weapons . ''
These missiles are deployed from beneath the wing of bomber planes and can reach their target with extreme accuracy . They travel at Mach 5 , five times the speed of sound , which could get you from New York City to Los Angeles in only 30 minutes .
In past tests , these speeds have caused the engine to melt , so current models are powered by a scramjet , a supersonic engine that , unlike a traditional engine , has few moving parts and instead utilizes an air-breathing propulsion system to keep cool .
`` The engine basically melted because it got so hot , '' Ryan Helbach , an official with the Air Force Research Laboratory , told Military.com . `` They did n't actively cool it . So for our program , we actively cooled the engine , which means that along the outside of the engine , we cycled the fuel around it to suck out the heat from the engine , heat up that fuel , and then inject it into the combustor for the scramjet engine . ''
The speed and accuracy of these weapons would allow for the military to successfully carry out time sensitive attacks . For example , in 1998 Osama bin Laden was known to be in a terrorist training camp in eastern Afghanistan , but by the time missiles were sent they had left the complex and the mission was unsuccessful .
Worried that the US will technologically surpass them , China and Russia have launched similar hypersonic programs , starting a second arms race .
`` Certainly , the U.S. is not the only country involved in developing hypersonic weapons , '' Mica Endsley , the Air Force 's chief scientist , told Military.com . “ They ( China ) are showing a lot of capability in this area . The advantage of hypersonics is not just that something goes very fast but that it can go great distances at those speeds . ''
According to The Guardian , experts are worried that , due to the method of deployment , hypersonic missiles may be confused for nuclear weapons and spark retaliation . Additionally , Foreign Policy magazine reported that America 's foray into hypersonic military technology has stirred a debate about whether China should abandon its policy not to use nuclear weapons first .

However , the US is pushing forward . The High Speed Strike Weapon and several other hypersonic weapons developed by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) are scheduled for testing in 2018 or 2019 .
`` Our goal is to make sure the Air Force has the knowledge in 2020 or over the next five years to be able to make acquisition decisions using this technology , '' Kenneth Davidson , manager of the hypersonic materials development at the Air Force Research Laboratory , told Military.com . `` Our goal is to provide a capability to stand off , launch these vehicles off the aircraft to hit time-critical dependent targets ... And ultimately from a manufacturing standpoint , it 's got to be affordable . ''
The Seattle Seahawks kicked off the 2017 season with a tight , frustrating 17-9 loss to the Green Bay Packers . An incredible and valiant performance by Seattle 's defense was marred by a choppy offense and some questionable officiating . Despite the general negativity around the game from a Seahawks perspective , they got out of week one healthy and with some positive takeaways .
The expected , the unexpected , the mind-boggling and the wildly frustrating make up this week 's post-game observations :
Two happy returns
Both Tyler Lockett and Earl Thomas were making their return from leg injuries suffered last December , and both looked like the players we 're accustomed to seeing .
Right out of the gate , Lockett took the game 's opening kick 43 yards to Seattle 's 39-yard line . They looked as dynamic , and more importantly as fluid , as they did before the injury . Lockett 's ability to change direction without losing any speed is a trait reserved for some of the league 's best playmakers , and it appears they still have that ability following a broken leg .
Thomas on the other hand was breaking on balls and flying to the football like they never missed a snap . Thomas 's game-changing ability is predicated on split-second decisions and reactions , and there was n't a hint of hesitation in their game today . After mentioning retirement in December following their injury , there is n't a sliver of doubt in their mind on the football field and that 's a damn happy sight .
Offensive Line
A sack on the game 's first play by Nick Perry was a good indicator of what was to come . Russell Wilson was rarely afforded a clean pocket over the course of four quarters , with pressure coming often from the interior via Mike Daniels , and from the outside via Perry .
Left tackle Rees Odhiambo got beat several times , getting bullied and out-physicaled by Perry on the outside . It 's going to be a long season for Odhiambo if he 's going to struggle against physical pass rushers . On the schedule : DeForest Buckner , Robert Quinn and Chandler Jones all twice , as well as Olivier Vernon , J.J. Watt , Jadeveon Clowney , Ryan Kerrigan , Vinny Curry and Calais Campbell . All edge rushers that can , and will , repeatedly force Odhiambo right back into Wilson 's lap .
Going to go out on a limb here and predict Matt Tobin 's first start for week seven , against the New York Giants .
Cornerbacks
Here 's something we knew heading into today 's game : Jeremy Lane has to play better , and play smarter , if he 's going to be in Seattle in 2018 . Here 's how Lane 's first drive went : flagged for pass interference , flagged for personal foul , ejected for throwing a punch . The Seahawks have never been able to rely on Lane over 16 games for that reason , and he 's off to a terrible start in 2017 . Lane 's foolish ejection put Seattle 's secondary in a tough position , but they responded admirably .
Shaquill Griffin immediately became Aaron Rodgers ' target , allowing two completions and getting flagged for holding on the next drive . Griffin 's mentality is perfect to play and succeed as a rookie cornerback ; he 's fearless , does n't get rattled and is confident attacking the football . They had two good , competitive pass breakups deep down the sideline , and they kept everything in front of him . It was a trial-by-fire debut for the rookie , but they have all the makings of a great Seahawk cornerback .
Justin Coleman stepped into Lane 's vacated nickel cornerback role and held their own . Like Griffin , Coleman was targeted by Rodgers often but they battled , and I think they give Seattle options at cornerback moving forward .
Defensive Line
From Green Bay 's first offensive drive , you could tell the Seahawks had a clear plan to combat the pace with which the Packers play with . Rotation was huge , with Michael Bennett , Cliff Avril , Jarran Reed , Sheldon Richardson , Nazair Jones , Frank Clark and David Bass all playing snaps in the opening drive . Throughout the game Marcus Smith worked their way into the defensive line as well .
On early downs , Clark and Bass would be lined up at the defensive end spots , before Avril and Bennett would come in on third down . Whether this is an indicator of the plan moving forward or was just to combat the Packers ' pace will be interesting to follow , because it was effective . Throughout the first three quarters the Seattle defense had constant pressure and went into halftime with four sacks .
The deadly pass rush of Clark-Richardson-Bennett-Avril did n't get much time together , but Avril did pick up a sack on a third-and-ten in that grouping after Richardson and Bennett collapsed the pocket .
All in all , the Seahawks used heavy rotation to keep everyone fresh , and found success by running stunts often to create pressure inside , before the game caught up to them in the fourth quarter . It would be unfair to expect the Seattle 's defensive line to keep up that level through four quarters against Rodgers and Green Bay , but even still they produced one of the best efforts I can remember from this defense .
Chris Carson , starting running back
It 's clear now that Carson is the team 's best running back , right ? There 's an argument to be made for Thomas Rawls , but like the old scouting adage goes ; health is a skill . Rawls has n't played a full season since high school , and wo n't in 2017 after missing week one with a high ankle sprain .
When Eddie Lacy was at their peak , they were initiating contact in the open field and was surprisingly nimble for their size . There was a couple carries today when Lacy would hunt contact , which makes me believe he 's at a good weight and is comfortable . But the short-area burst they once possessed is gone . There was a notable difference when Lacy would get a carry , seemingly getting to the line of scrimmage full seconds after Carson would have .
If Rawls can get healthy , it will give the Seahawks a couple really good options in the backfield . But next week , it 's worth giving Carson a full workload and seeing what they can do with it .
Special Teams
How good was Seattle 's special teams today ? Footballs were exploding off of Jon Ryan 's foot , who finished with an average of 45.8 yards per punt and a long of 59 yards .
Neiko Thorpe looked every bit the invaluable special teamer that they are , downing Ryan 's first punt inside the five , getting downfield to make the tackle on Ryan 's second , and forcing a fair catch at the five on the third . Newcomer D.J . Alexander made plays on special teams as well , and it looks like the Seahawks are going to get a really strong season out of their third phase .
Odds and Ends
The passing game as a whole was quiet and never really got started , but Paul Richardson got in their patented one great catch a game . The way they use their long , stringbean frame to attack the football and meet it at its highest point consistently impresses me . With Jermaine Kearse gone , Richardson is going to have a chance to really shine , and will have a great opportunity to next week against the 49ers .
After much was made of the SAM linebacker competition heading into 2016 , Mike Morgan played ten snaps in week one and did n't average a whole lot more than that in the following 15 games . The snap counts have n't been made available for today 's game yet , but I think Terence Garvin at least doubled that figure . Their play was a lot like their play in preseason ; popping up every now and then , good for a splash play once a game . I doubt we 'll see a whole lot more base defense from Seattle this season compared to last , but it seems like the Seahawks have more options at linebacker than they did a year ago .
Pete Carroll 's Seattle Seahawks are n't one to dwell on a loss , and they certainly wo n't after today . Held tough in Lambeau Field against one of the league 's best teams , the attention will now move to the San Francisco 49ers next Sunday at home .
What is it ? The Katzenklavier is , erm , a piano made out of cats . No , we 're not making this up .
Who uses it ? Despite the initial design having some vague specifications about ordering pitch , the Katzenklavier was never intended , really , for musical use . It was actually invented for psychiatrists . Wait , it gets weirder .
How does it work ? The existing drawings , based on historical descriptions of the Katzenklavier , suggested that the instrument consisted of a keyboard , with seven to nine cats held in cages corresponding to the approximate pitch of their mewling . Each of the cats ' tails is stretched out and held down . Above each tail is a nail . Depressing a key assigned to a specific cat causes a mechanism to drive the nail into the tail resulting in a shriek from the poor animal . Pretty horrible , eh ?
Where does it come from ? Well you can console yourself with the knowledge ( as far as we know ) that the contraption was never built . It was invented sometime in the 17th century by Athanasius Kircher , a German Jesuit renaissance man operating in the fields of medicine , oriental studies and geology . The Katzenklavier was one of several wacky machines Kircher claimed to have invented – the others included an automaton statue which could listen and talk , a perpetual motion machine , and the Aeolian harp .
Why is it classic ? Because it 's just too horrible to contemplate ! An 18th-century German physician named Johann Christian Reil wrote that the device was intended to shake mental patients who had lost the ability to focus out of a `` fixed state '' and into `` conscious awareness '' . The patient must be placed so that they are sitting in direct view of the cats ' expressions when the psychiatrist plays a fugue on the infernal instrument . In these modern enlightened times , there are several `` cat pianos '' available for the iPhone , and none of them involve the torture of felines – they 're just a bit twee . The Katzenklavier also inspired the excellent Nick Cave-narrated animation , The Cat Piano .

Five facts and things
• A bizarre 16th-century anecdote concerning an extravagant procession in Brussels thrown in honour of King Philip II of Spain describes a bear riding a chariot and playing an organ where the tails of 20 howling cats were bound to the keys . Somewhat spurious , but the first-ever description of a working Katzenklavier , and a century before it was invented by Kircher !
• French historian Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin writes of finding records alluding to similar `` cat organs '' operational in Saint-Germain in 1753 and Prague in 1773 , as well as uncovering an engraving depicting a torturous musical instrument designed to create a cacophony by abusing a choir of dogs , monkeys , donkeys and cows .
• Also in Saint-Germain during the 17th century was said to have been a fairground attraction called `` Miaulique '' , where several cats seated in front of a musical score would be conducted through a cat opera by a monkey . Yep . A MONKEY .
• Several composers have been deeply inspired by cats . Works by Adriano Banchieri , Adam Krieger , Carlo Farina , Gioachino Rossini and Robert Lucas de Pearsall all feature `` miaowing '' arrangements for voice and other instruments .
• Domenico Scarlatti 's The Cat 's Fugue was legendarily co-authored by the composer 's cat ! The moggy had a little run about on the keys which suggested the first three measures of the piece , leaving Scarlatti to finish up the rest . These days we have Nora , and of course , Keyboard Cat .

ESPN Falcons reporter Vaughn McClure nominates Devonta Freeman for their game ball , and Titans reporter Paul Kuharsky selects Wesley Woodyard for their game ball . ( 1:45 )
NASHVILLE , Tenn. -- Being better than last year no longer seems like the correct or reasonable standard for judging the Tennessee Titans six games and seven weeks into this season .
Coach Ken Whisenhunt very much wanted to wash away the stink of 2014 's 2-14 season in the late winter and early spring . They thought we should refer to it less as they moved on .
I do n't know that it 's fair , then , to use being better than that as a reference point now .
I asked them about understanding the concerns about a 3-19 two-year record as Titans coach .
“ Yeah , I understand . I do understand , ” they said , drained and answering the same questions about the same results from a podium not long after Sunday 's 10-7 loss to Atlanta . “ I 'll tell you what other thing I understand . I understand we 're a different football team than we were last year .
“ We 're playing with a lot of young guys , we 've got a lot of things going on , but we 're a much better football team than we were last year . I 'll be happy to debate that with you . ”
No debate is needed . It 's true .
It 's just not enough .
The Titans now should be judged against the Titans from earlier this season , not the Titans from last season .
They won a blowout in Tampa Bay .
They got killed by big plays in Cleveland .
They blew a lead against the Colts .
They gave up a key third-and-23 against the Bills .
They got blown out by Miami .
Giving away a late chance at a win or overtime against the Falcons on Sunday did n't qualify as better than most of that .
It was better than getting stomped by the Dolphins as Miami debuted an interim coach .
That 's about it .
My debate would be about whether they are better than they were earlier this season .
The current Titans have stopped converting third downs on offense . They are turning the ball over too much . They ca n't commit to the run , even in a close game during which they have a back in Antonio Andrews faring well . They are incapable of taking advantage of a defensive effort by holding an opponent to 10 points .
Bad Company The worst 22-game starts for an NFL coach since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger , per Elias . Coach First year Team Record John McKay * 1976 Tampa Bay 0-22 Jim Ringo * * 1976 Buffalo 3-19 Leeman Bennett 1985 Tampa Bay 3-19 Rich Kotite 1995 N.Y . Jets 3-19 Jimmy Johnson 1989 Dallas 3-19 Jim Schwartz 2009 Detroit 3-19 Ken Whisenhunt 2014 Tennessee 3-19 * -Expansion team ; * * -Took over after five games
Whisenhunt did n't inherit a very good team , but it was 7-9 in Mike Munchak 's final year . If it had to bottom out in order to start to climb , so be it .
However , Whisenhunt has been at the controls for 22 games now , and the only signs of that climb are that the Titans now lose close more often than they get blown out .
Sixty percent of this season 's losses have been one-score games ; it was 36 percent last year .
No player has offered anything less than a public statement of faith in Whisenhunt as the team 's head coach .
“ We love Whiz , ” outside linebacker Brian Orakpo said . “ We 've got to win for him . ”
Delanie Walker agreed .
“ Whiz is a great coach , ” said the tight end . “ He takes care of us . ”
Such statements qualify as helpful leadership -- telling the rest of the roster to stay the course . It is also the smart play , remaining loyal company men who wo n't rock a boat to the point where they help it take on water .
The plan is still holding the attention of a young team , both Whisenhunt and their players say . It has gotten them close multiple times , and they are on the verge .
It also has become repetitious . It 's increasingly harder to believe .
The Titans need to get quarterback Marcus Mariota healthy . They need to protect him , they need to make catches for them and Whisenhunt needs to call good games for him . The defense needs to build on what it did against the Falcons .
That 's where the hope is .
It 's about the only place .
Last week the final version of the NASA Eagleworks EmDrive paper , titled “ Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in Vacuum , ” published in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics ( AIAA ) 's prestigious Journal of Propulsion and Power , described promising experimental results and hinted at possible theoretical models .
The experimental results :
“ Thrust data from forward , reverse , and null suggested that the system was consistently performing at 1.2 ± 0.1 mN∕kW , which was very close to the average impulsive performance measured in air . A number of error sources were considered and discussed . ”
It 's worth noting that the EmDrive performs much better than the other “ zero propellant ” propulsion systems studied to date . A modest thrust without having to carry fuel can be better , especially for long-distance space missions , than a higher thrust at the cost of having to carry bulky and heavy propellant reserves .
“ NASA is looking forward to the scientific discussions with the broader technical community that will occur based on the publication of the Eagleworks team 's experimental findings , ” said Jay Bolden , an Engineering PUblic Affairs Officer with NASA 's Johnson Space Center , as reported by Discover Magazine . “ This is part of what NASA does in exploring the unknown , and the agency is committed to and focused on the priorities and investments identified by the NASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan . ”
“ Through these investments , NASA will develop the capabilities necessary to send humans farther into space than ever before . ”
The NASA Eagleworks paper is focused on the experimental test results and does n't propose a detailed theoretical explanation – which is not surprising since there is no accepted theoretical explanation of the “ anomalous ” thrust observed in EmDrive tests . However , the Eagleworks scientists hint at a possible theoretical model , still qualitative and under development , which could lead to a theoretical explanation of why and how the EmDrive works .
This is a short and hopefully readable outline of the developing theoretical model proposed by the NASA scientists . I think reversing the order of the considerations in the paper can make the outline easier to follow .
The researchers propose that the EmDrive “ pushes off of quantum vacuum fluctuations… and moves in one direction while a wake is established in the quantum vacuum that moves in the other direction . ”
The quantum vacuum is not empty space where nothing happens , but a dynamic medium filled with virtual particles – “ virtual ” indicating particles that pop in and out of existence fast enough for the universe not to notice that conservation of energy has been violated . In fact , the energy to create virtual particles can be considered as “ borrowed ” and “ paid back ” in a very short time .
This quantum vacuum concept is part of mainstream consensus physics : according to Frank Wilczek , Nobel Laureate in Physics , “ the quantum vacuum is a dynamic medium , whose properties and responses largely determine the behavior of matter . ”
What is more controversial is the idea of treating the quantum vacuum as a medium capable of supporting acoustic oscillations that carry momentum in one direction , pushing the EmDrive in the other . But , according to the Eagleworks researchers , these ideas is suggested by the results of their 2015 paper titled “ Dynamics of the Vacuum and Casimir Analogs to the Hydrogen Atom , ” showing that “ the first 7 energy levels of the hydrogen atom could be viewed as longitudinal resonant acoustic wave modes in the quantum vacuum . ”
The more general idea that the quantum vacuum “ could potentially be modeled at the microscopic scale as an electron-positron plasma ” is explored in another 2015 paper , authored by Eagleworks team leader Harold “ Sonny ” White , elaborating on the ideas that White proposed in a 2009 article titled “ Can the Quantum Vacuum be used as a propellant source ? , ” published in Space Times , the magazine of the American Astronautical Society .
According to White , the quantum vacuum can be treated as a virtual plasma made up of electron- positron ( e-p ) pairs , which permits engineering an apparatus to act on the virtual plasma by “ squeezing the quantum vacuum , ” and use it as a propellant . White argues that quantum vacuum oscillations can transfer momentum across the enclosure of the apparatus , pushing it forward . Besides explaining why the EmDrive works , White 's quantum vacuum model could have far reaching implications for fundamental physics . For example , “ the gravitational constant can be shown to be a long wavelength consequence of the quantum vacuum rather than a fundamental constant , ” which suggests that gravitation itself could emerge from quantum vacuum physics .
Pilot-Waves in the Quantum Vacuum
A related idea proposed by the Eagleworks scientists in the Journal of Propulsion and Power paper , which could also have far reaching implications for fundamental physics , is that quantum vacuum fluctuations ( virtual particles ) could be the dynamic medium that guides real particles in pilot-wave quantum physics theories . In fact , the researchers start the theory section of the paper by describing their theoretical model as “ a nonlocal hidden-variable theory , or pilot-wave theory for short . ”
Quantum physics are considered mysterious , and deeply counter-intuitive . Evidence seems to suggest that quantum particles can not be thought of as having definite positions when they are not observed . In other words , according to currently leading interpretations of quantum physics , speaking of a particle 's trajectory between observations is meaningless . The famous double slit experiment , which according to Richard Feynman encompasses all that is mysterious in quantum physics , is often taken as a demonstration that quantum particles are not “ real particles ” with clearly defined trajectories .
In pilot-wave theories , quantum particles are treated as real particles – little things that always have well-defined positions and trajectories – and their motion is driven by a real physical field ( the pilot-wave ) . The first pilot-wave theory was proposed in the 1920s by Louis de Broglie , one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics , and another pilot-wave theory was proposed by David Bohm in the 1950s . In the double slit experiment , a particle going through one slit knows if the other slit is open or closed , since the information is in the pilot-wave , and moves accordingly .
The pilot-wave idea “ seems to me so natural and simple , to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way , that it is a great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored , ” wrote John Stewart Bell in their seminal work “ Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics . ”
So where is the catch ? The catch , as demonstrated by Bell himself , is that viable pilot-wave theories must be non-local – in other words , they must exhibit faster than light correlations between different locations .
“ The universe seems to like talking to itself faster than the speed of light , ” said Aephraim Steinberg , a physicist at the University of Toronto who participated in recent experiments that seem to support the pilot-wave idea . “ I could understand a universe where nothing can go faster than light , but a universe where the internal workings operate faster than light , and yet we 're forbidden from ever making use of that at the macroscopic level – it 's very hard to understand. ” In fact , it appears that faster than light correlations ca n't be used to send signals ( Bell again ) .
Stochastic mechanics , a related approach notably pioneered by Edward Nelson , treats quantum particle as immersed in and driven by a bath of quantum fluctuations , which Nelson models statistically like Brownian motion . Here again , non-locality is a necessary feature of a viable theory . Stochastic mechanics could be “ an approximation to a correct theory of quantum mechanics as emergent , ” noted Nelson in a 2012 review paper .
“ But what is the correct theory ? ”
Perhaps the correct theory could be , as suggested by the NASA Eagleworks scientists , a detailed and quantitative theory of quantum vacuum fluctuations of virtual particles that drive the motion of real particles like a pilot-wave .
It 's worth noting that , contrary to conventional quantum mechanics , pilot-wave quantum-like behavior can be reproduced in classical fluids and explained by classical ( non-quantum ) fluid dynamics . In fact , fluid droplets bouncing on a vibrating fluid bath generate a pilot-wave field that , in turn , guides the motion of the droplets themselves with a striking similarity to quantum behavior . In particular , in the fluid version of the double slit experiment , a droplet goes through one slit , but the pilot wave goes trough both slits and recombines , interfering with itself , in such a way as to guide the droplet on a complex trajectory that reproduces the results of the quantum double slit experiment .
To explore the fascinating quantum-like behavior of fluid droplets , watch the video below and see two review articles by John Bush , a professor of applied mathematics at MIT : “ The New Wave of Pilot-Wave Theory ” and “ Pilot-Wave Hydrodynamics . ”
Whether this is just an interesting similarity , or has a deeper meaning , remains to be seen . It 's interesting to speculate on the possibility that quantum vacuum fluctuations could play the role of the vibrating fluid bath in the droplet experiments .

CARLSBAD ( CBS ) - A woman in Los Angeles is filing a claim against two Carlsbad Police officers , accusing them of brutality .
They say the officers attacked them after they complained about one of them . Local bystanders captured the encounter on cell phone video .
Cindy Hahn says that the encounter began when they saw a Carlsbad police officer standing by a car with its alarm going off .
`` I said , 'what 's going on here ? ' And they said , 'is this your car ? ' I said 'no sir ' and they says 'then mind your ( expletive ) business , ' '' said Cindy Hahn .
Cindy then called the police department to complain about the officer 's comment and shortly after they left , the officer they had complained about pulled them over .
`` The next thing I know , I 'm on the ground and he 's attacking me and then the other officer comes and I 'm thinking he 's going to help me and they ratcheted it up , '' said Cindy .
When the second officer arrived , they can be seen driving a knee into their back and then punching her , all while their children were watching from Cindy 's car .
`` They 're screaming for me . They 're screaming and I have my hand behind my back and I ca n't get to my kids . That 's a horrible feeling , '' said Cindy .
Cindy was charged with battery on a peace officer and resisting an executive officer . Those charges were dropped , but she 's now filed a complaint against the city and the two police officers , identified as Jody Knisley and Kenyatte Valentine . The claim accuses them of violating their civil rights , negligence and battery .
Cindy says their son and daughter have also been traumatized by the experience .
`` It was really weird . They kept yelling stop resisting arrest and I 'm not resisting arrest , I 'm resisting you hurting me , '' said Cindy . `` I would like to see justice for me and my family and for these men to pay . ''
Cindy says they suffered brain contusions and a concussion from the arrest .
Carlsbad Police Chief Neil Gallucci issued this statement :
Whenever there is an active lawsuit , the Police Department is under heavy restrictions on what information we are legally able to share .

In my interview with Don Imus last Wednesday , I finally got around to talking about something I rarely get to – black immigrants . More on that in a minute .
It 's amazing how much we fawn over Senator Obama 's being ‘ black ' without displaying any interest in that blackness , as if being a half-Kenyan mostly ex-pat tells us all we need to know about him . All that 's interesting . That 's what I was trying to get at generally in my book , The End of Blackness , and in this infamous piece . I finally got to it on , of all places , the Don Imus show .
That interview with Imus was so unbelievable , you simply have to listen to it . Here 's part 1 and part 2 .
Damned if Imus has n't been doing yeoman 's work in moving America 's neurotic race obsession forward . I 've been talking and writing about race for 12 years now , but I was gobsmacked on the air . Imus schooled a sister . When they said they were through apologizing for Rutgers , I took that to mean they were through talking about it . But he 's certainly not through thinking about it , and he 's been doing their homework .
Usually , people have me on for conversations that go like this : “ I 'd really like to know what you think about X race topic. ” [ I attempt to address the question ] . “ Uh , excuse me , I do n't mean to interrupt and I really want to know what you think , but what I think is _. ” Then the person orates for a long time on the dusty , pre-conceived , self-justifying notion they ( black or white , liberal or conservative ) have no intention of changing . The ‘ question ' always turns out to be , “ Have n't I just brilliantly ended the whole race thing ? ”
With rare exceptions , I 've long known I 'm invited on by “ enemies ” ( liberals and conservatives , blacks and whites ) as a mere visual aid “ proving ” their open-mindedness . I might as well be wearing an evening gown , smiling and vamping in the background like Vanna White . I 'm just window dressing for a soliloquy . All I can do is hope that somewhere in the audience someone is actually listening , and will actually go back and read what I said and might have talked about if allowed to .
Print interviews with ‘ liberal ' black journalists ( they 're really quite conservative ; you must be black in exactly the way they demand ) are the worst . They already ‘ know ' I 'm a Tom and talking to me serves two purposes , none of them reportorial : it proves they 're ‘ objective ' even though nothing I say or write ever makes a difference and it gives them fodder to dine out on with the other ‘ real ' black people . “ You would n't believe how self-hating they are. ” They call me names but they do n't engage in actual debate . Kneejerk does n't begin to cover it . Don seems to have done the impossible and moved beyond that .
Of course , it must be said that Imus sandbagged me .
I was , let 's say , surprised ' by the invitation and mulled it over for a week . When I thought I could be professional and said yes , it was supposed to be about the election and it was supposed to be short . It was neither ; homey went straight to Black History month , everything I 'd ever written about race , everything in the black canon about race and—unbelievably—Rutgers . See how The Man is always setting us up ?
Two kids , two books , two cities , and about 15 jobs ago , I wrote a Washington Post column that I ca n't now find , pleading for someone in public life to admit to sexism or racism or immorality so that the rest of us could . Two of my examples where Justice Thomas admitting to having been a pig towards Anita Hill and Rev . Sharpton admitting that he 'd been wrong about Tawana Brawley and paying what they owed to the man whose life and career he 'd ruined with their ultimately false accusations . Until someone in public life manned up in that way , we 'd all just have to go on lying about our all too human failings , waiting in vain for an example of confession and atonement .
Until then , no one could be forgiven , publicly or privately , for our momentary -ism 's and we all are guilty of something sometime . Never thought that person in public life would be Don Imus and damned if the whole forgiving thing is n't much , much harder than I could have possibly imagined . What is it they say about being careful what you ask for ? Offended as I initially was to be asked , I 'm glad I did the show . They made a mistake , they took responsibility , they asked for forgiveness . Done , Don .
Now , black immigrants .
At The Root , a new black site from the Washington Post , Meri Danquah , a Ghanaian immigrant , writes all too briefly about the invisibility that black immigrants face in America . When , that is , they are not facing outright hostility , mostly from slave-descended blacks . They write :
…Excited by the fact that I , a newly naturalized citizen , was about to vote for the first time , I asked my editor if they would be supporting Sen. Barack Obama , my chosen candidate .
“ He does n't do anything for me , ” my editor said . “ When I vote for a black man , I want it to be somebody who 's really black , somebody who knows the black American experience , somebody whose great-great granddaddy was a slave , like mine . You know , those Africans come over here and just reap the rewards of everything we 've worked for . They think they 're better than us and white folks love 'em because they're… ”
I bit my lip and listened to their diatribe against African immigrants . Surely , I thought , he 's forgotten who he 's talking to . That did n't come as much of a surprise . I find that a lot of people forget I 'm an immigrant ; more precisely , an African immigrant .
This , simply , is what I meant when I said Obama is n't black . The way the term is used , all it means is : descendant of West African slaves brought here to labor for whites against their will . How many times can I say this : I 'm describing a politico-cultural reality which I reject . Yes , Shirley Chisholm and Malcolm X were of West Indian immigrant stock . They achieved mainstream black power because they kept that side of themselves out of the public eye and focused on the battle with whitey . Had they not , we 'd not know their names . ( My hero , W.E.B . DuBois , cruelly mocked and isolated the ostentatiously West Indian Marcus Garvey precisely because they were so ostentatiously West Indian . )
I 'm critiquing the notion that all that 's important about us is our historic relationship of antagonism with American whites , a relationship that immigrant blacks do not have ( however similar their histories are to ours ) . I 'm critiquing the notion that knowing someone , at some point , came from Africa provides us any useful information , if they are not descended from slaves . That , we know but we do n't know diddly about black immigrants and we do n't care to , black or white . I reject this .
What , exactly , do I and an immigrant Nigerian cab driver with a doctorate they ca n't use here in common beyond the label ‘ black ' ? Only they know , because they 're not allowed to be ‘ black ' outside of our binary slavery/Jim Crow/police brutality/segregation continuum . Native blacks see to that : when have we ever advocated for immigrant blacks unless they stray into Jim Crow territory ( Diallo , etc ) . Our hostility to immigration is legendary ; if we 're all ‘ black , ' why have n't we carved out a protective exemption for black immigrants ? Because we do n't feel a kinship , we do n't want them talking outside the box , we do n't want them changing the subject to entrepreneurship and immigration reform . And we certainly do n't want them taking ‘ our ' jobs and affirmative action slots . Too bad for ‘ us ' they do n't need them .
As Clarence Page points out , black immigrants are America 's true ‘ model minority , ' not that anyone , outside of admissions offices and hiring offices , cares .
Do African immigrants make the smartest Americans ? The question may sound outlandish , but if you were judging by statistics alone , you could find plenty of evidence to back it up .
In a side-by-side comparison of 2000 census data by sociologist John R. Logan at the Mumford Center , State University of New York at Albany , black immigrants from Africa average the highest educational attainment of any population group in the country , including whites and Asians .
That trend continues in their offspring . From The Guardian :
The joint University of Pennsylvania-Princeton report found that although immigrant-origin black students make up only 13 percent of the black population in the US , they now comprise 27 percent of black students at the 28 top US universities surveyed .
And in a sample of the elite Ivy League universities the figures were even more dramatic . More than 40 percent of black students in the Ivy League now come from immigrant families . Overall , however , black students still make up only 6 percent-7 percent of Ivy League students , while 12 percent of the general US population is black . In the non-ivy league selective colleges studied , such as Berkeley , Emory , Stanford , Tufts , Wesleyan , Barnard and Smith , black students make up between 3 percent and 9 percent of the population .
This should cause jubilation at the NAACP , right ? Wrong . Also from The Guardian ( emphasis added ) :
“ Immigrant and second-generation blacks are over-represented at these schools , while overall black students are still too few , ” says Dr. Camille Charles , sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the report 's co-authors , “ which means the problem of access for African-Americans – that group which has the longest history of oppression in the US – is of even greater concern than we thought . ”
Charles does n't want immigrant black students to have less access , but they are concerned that African-Americans whose families have been in the US since before the civil war and whose forefathers were slaves are doubly losing out . There is a worry that selective , usually private , universities are taking an “ any black student will do ” approach to diversity .
If we 're all ‘ black ' , why wo n't any black student do ?
You have to read the piece to have your mind blown . The words do n't even cohere as ‘ black , ' ‘ African , ' and ‘ African American ' try to make sense of themselves . Blacks who run affirmative action programs are quoted being incensed by the ‘ over representation ' of immigrant blacks , and that ‘ blacks ' who 've fled war and rape in Haiti are seen as having ‘ sexier ' admission essays than ‘ blacks ' who 've overcome South Central .
‘ Black ' is simply a label which obscures more than it illuminates . That 's all I was trying to say .
Bitcoin is known as ‘ digital gold ' and is by far the most popular cryptocurrency . However , it is slowly losing its dominance in the market to some great alternatives . Bitcoin has seen some great success , but it has its problems , and it 's now becoming clear that it 's not suitable for every application .
‘ Altcoins ' are also based on blockchain technology , but they have some key differences in their goals , communities , and technical details . Let 's take a look at some of the most popular alternatives to Bitcoin , and why you might want to get your hands on some .
Litecoin
Litecoin is the simplest alternative to Bitcoin . Its goal is to be the “ silver to Bitcoin 's gold ” , and offer a genuine alternative with a few subtle differences .
Litecoin has a much shorter ‘ block time ' than Bitcoin . 2.5 minutes rather than 10 minutes . This means that Litecoin transactions are faster , and more transactions can happen per second . Also , there will be 84 million Litecoins mined in total rather than Bitcoin 's 21 million .
Bitcoin mining is now done mainly by big mining companies with specialist hardware . Litecoin prevents this by using a different encryption algorithm called ‘ scrypt ' . This helps Litecoin mining stay democratic and fair .
Ethereum
The Ethereum project is the next biggest alternative to Bitcoin , but it does n't see itself as a direct competitor . Bitcoin is designed for transactions , while Ethereum is designed for so much more . The plan is to build the world 's first global , decentralized computer , and Ether tokens are the fuel that drives it . All together this altcoin is currently worth almost $ 20 Billion and approaching half the total value of Bitcoins . As reflected by ETH to USD exchange rate Ether stands a good chance to compete with Bitcoin for the leadership in the near future .
The Ethereum blockchain contains a fully functional programming language , meaning developers can develop applications that run on the decentralized network . These can be things like smart contracts – contracts that are automatically fulfilled when certain conditions are met .
Ethereum Classic
Back in 2016 , Ethereum experienced some serious problems . Some of the ‘ smart contracts ' running on Ethereum were poorly written , and lot 's of money was taken from them . Instead of just accepting this outcome , the Ethereum community came up with a plan to erase that theft from the blockchain history . It worked , and the ether tokens was recovered .
However , many believe that a blockchain should be an ‘ immutable ' ledger that can not be changed . This belief has led to a few Ethereum miners sticking to the old blockchain , even though it was hacked . You can still buy Ether tokens from this original blockchain on many cryptocurrency marketplaces under the name “ Ethereum Classic ” .
Monero
Monero literally means “ coin ” in Esperanto , and it is another serious player in the cryptocurrency world . Monero has a market capitalization of over $ 700,000,000 and markets itself as a “ secure , private , untraceable currency ” . This privacy-focused altcoin gained popularity after it was adopted by AlphaBay – a major darknet market .
Technically , Monero is quite different to Bitcoin . Early developers put more emphasis on robust algorithms for privacy , meaning you can make transactions on the Monero blockchain anonymously more easily . Like Litecoin , its mining method is designed to be more resistant to centralization and specialized hardware . Also , there is no fixed block size limit , meaning increasing demand can increase block size .
All this adds up to a cryptocurrency that 's great for transacting on large marketplaces that want to stay anonymous .
Dash
Dash , or ‘ Digital Cash ' , is similar to Monero in many ways but has taken a slightly different approach . It rebranded from “ Darkcoin ” in 2015 . It 's still heavily focused on privacy , but also wants to make “ digital currencies so easy your Grandma would use them ” .
It has some unique features such as ‘ InstantSend ' for instantaneous transactions , and ‘ PrivateSend ' making it more difficult to trace transactions .
Zcash
Zcash is another digital currency that claims to be more secure than Bitcoin . The Zcash website states that “ If Bitcoin is http for money , Zcash is https – a secure transport layer ” . It does this by implementing something called zero-knowledge encryption , enabling the ‘ Fungibility ' of coins .
This means unlike Bitcoins , each Zcash coin is unlinked to its history and indistinguishable from other coins . The result is that the sender , recipient , and value of each transaction remain completely anonymous .
Ripple ( XRP )
Ripple is a global payment network that uses blockchain technology . Privately owned , centralized , and heavily sponsored by big banks – it 's about as different from Bitcoin as you can get . It does n't aim to liberate money or remove the need for banks in transactions . Instead , its primary aim is to make banks more efficient – and it 's working . Ripple has the 3rd biggest market capitalization after Ethereum , with a total value of Ripple coins ( XRP ) currently at $ 1.2 Billion USD .
It is designed very differently from other cryptocurrencies . The focus is to offer fast , efficient transactions , and massive scalability . Also , there is no mining whatsoever . All the XRP coins already exist and most are controlled by Ripple .
Dogecoin
One of the more light-hearted digital currencies , Dogecoin actually started as a joke . But , with a total value of over $ 300 million USD , it 's becoming quite a serious Bitcoin alternative . Dogecoin 's main application has been as an internet tipping tool . Users tip other users for providing helpful content online .
Technically it is very different to Bitcoin . Its block time of just 1 minute is even shorter than Litecoin and means transactions can happen quickly . Mining also works differently . 100 Billion Dogecoins have already been mined , and there is no upper limit on how many can be mined in the future .
Which One is Best ?
There is no such thing as a perfect cryptocurrency . However , most exchanges are offering a limited range of cryptocurrencies to trade with . The leading cryptocurrency exchange , CEX.IO , allows for trading Bitcoin and Ether only . As a rule it depends on the demand among the users , trading volumes and the total market cap for that particular cryptocurrency .
Each decision in designing a blockchain protocol comes with advantages and tradeoffs . Bitcoin might be digital gold , but there is certainly room for other blockchain based projects to solve the problems Bitcoin ca n't .
Whether you 're looking for privacy , security , decentralization , interesting applications , or just return on investment , there is something out there for you . The best cryptocurrencies to get involved in are the ones that align with your interests and needs .
The Kiowa Warrior is slated to retire in 2025 , the Chinook in 2035 , and both the Apache and Black Hawk will be gone by 2040 . We thought we had a suitable replacement for all of these platforms in the Boeing-Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche . But then , this next-gen stealth chopper vanished in a puff of bureaucratic smoke .
The RAH-66 Comanche would have been awesome—a veritable 21st Century Air Wolf . Designed for armed reconnaissance and assault operations , the Comanche could have done the work of both the lighter OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and the older AH-1 Cobra , but in stealth . The RAH-66 's body was constructed almost entirely of radar-absorbing composite materials and shaped to minimize the helicopter 's radar cross-section . On radar , the Comanche appeared 360 times smaller than the equivalently-sized AH-64 Apache . And in real life , it would have looked badass . Its five-blade main and shrouded tail rotors were also constructed from composite materials in order to minimize their noise .

The 43 foot long , tandem two-seater would have been powered by a pair of 1,563 hp turboshaft engines which provided a top speed of 201 MPH and a 173 mile combat radius . Its avionics and navigation systems were state of the art ; using digital fly-by-wire and the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System ( HIDSS ) similar to what current Typhoon pilots enjoy . And , in addition to its retractable .50 cal belly gun , the RAH-66 could also carry six Hellfires or 12 Stinger missiles in its retractable weapons pylons .
In 1983 , development on a replacement to the `` Vietman Era '' helicopters—specifically the OH-58D Kiowa and the AH-1 Cobra—which became the basis of the Light Helicopter Experimental program . Six years of internal planning later , the Army got around to issuing a Request for Proposals and just three years after that , in 1991 , the Army awarded a development contract to Boeing-Sikorsky for the production of two prototypes .
Boeing-Sikorski spent the next nine years getting the RAH-66 off the drawing board . It was n't until the middle of 2000 that the engineering and manufacturing phase began . And over the next four years , the team was able to produce a whopping two—count 'em , two—prototypes before the Army axed the project due to changing operational requirements .

The Army literally spent so long naval gazing at the platform that the RAH-66 became obsolete before it even got into the air . Boeing-Sikorsky was supposed to produce more than 1,200 of the machines once mass production began in 2006 . Nope , that 's not happening .
As Brig . Gen. Anthony Crutchfield told National Defense Magazine back in 2011 ,
the difficulties with new helicopter programs in the past have been that technology , as well as the needs of the service , evolve during a long , drawn-out process . Inserting new requirements in the middle of the development cycle has led to the failures .

The Army 's R & D department was n't always this bogged down in red tape . The venerable UH-1 Iroquois ( aka the `` Huey '' ) helicopter took just 8 years to go from drawing board to battlefield back int the '50s . Hell , it took longer just for the RAH-66 dev team to settle on the name `` Comanche . '' And in the modern era , the Army 's new front line fab lab has already proved its worth pushing out vital replacement parts for forward operating bases in a matter of hours and days , not weeks and months . But that does n't make the loss of $ 7 billion and nearly a quarter century of design work any less difficult to swallow . [ Time - National Defense Magazine - Boeing - Army Tech - Wiki - GlobeSec ]
How has the internet affected the skeptical movement and the promotion of science and critical thinking ? Is the internet a boon or a bane to scientific literacy ?
This question came up several times at the recent TAM conference , including while we were being interviewed for an article in TidBITS , a tech journal .
I wish I had more scientific evidence with which to answer this question . But I do have some informed opinions based upon being in the trenches for the last decade .
There is no question that the advent of social media , blogs , and podcasts correlated with an explosion in the skeptical community . We went from being a loose collection of small local groups , with a few national groups largely pursuing their own agenda , to a vibrant intellectual community . At the recent TAM there was over 1600 people in attendance – which is unprecedented for this type of meeting .
But the specific question is this – does the access to information afforded by the internet help skeptics or promoters of pseudoscience more ? My sense is that it disproportionately helps skeptics . This view is largely based upon Google search rankings .
As a quick experiment , I typed in the following terms to see in which position ( not including paid ads ) the first hardcore skeptical treatment of the topic appears :
“ magnet therapy ” – 2
“ acupuncture ” – 9
“ homeopathy ” – 2
“ do vaccines cause autism ” – 12
“ intelligent design ” – 5
“ ESP ” – 5
All of these , except for the autism topic , put a skeptical website on the first page of the Google rankings , which is critical . There is still much room for improvement , but given the relative size of the skeptical community we are having a disproportionately high profile . Incidentally , Wikipedia is almost always the first listing for each topic , and there is a significant skeptical presence there as well ( but again , with huge room for improvement ) .
I speculate that the reason for this is the way in which we promote and share information . Skepticism is about promoting science , critical thinking , and reliable information . We tend to link to each other and reinforce each other , and I think the quality of our information is generally high . These are all factors that give favorable Google ranking .
There are perhaps thousands of promotional or gullible sites on all of these topics for every skeptical site , but they tend to be more self-promotional and not as scholarly . I am apparently not the only one to think so . Coincidentally , PZ Myers reports that Josh McDowell is concerned about the benefit the internet gives to skeptics :
Now here is the problem , going all the way back , when Al Gore invented the Internet [ he said jokingly ] , I made the statement off and on for 10-11 years that the abundance of knowledge , the abundance of information , will not lead to certainty ; it will lead to pervasive skepticism . And , folks , that 's exactly what has happened . It 's like this . How do you really know , there is so much out there… This abundance [ of information ] has led to skepticism . And then the Internet has leveled the playing field [ giving equal access to skeptics ] .
Yes – there is a lot of information out there . It sounds like McDowell is lamenting access to information and the loss of the good-ol-days when children could be shielded from contrary views . As skeptics we embrace the democratization of information ( there 's no stopping it in any case ) and our goal is to give people the tools needed to live in the age of information .
I hope that McDowell is correct and that they have real reason to fear . In the free marketplace of ideas I think that the skeptical world view has real value and even appeal . Sectarian views that rely upon intellectual isolation are likely to be threatened . That 's a good thing .
If your belief system can not survive close or open scrutiny , if it can not compete in the rough and tumble world of free information , perhaps it is lacking in some fundamental way .
It will be interesting to see how the internet experiment plays out over the next century . The view I outlined above is the optimistic view . The pessimistic view is that , human nature being what it is , the lowest common denominator will tend to predominate and motivated misinformation ( which tends to be more profitable than skepticism ) will overwhelm patient scholarship .
My hope is that the early signs ( the disproportionately high Google rankings of skeptical sites ) will be an indication that the truth will be closer to the optimistic view .

The non-partisan Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) released a report on Tuesday recommending that birth control be classified as preventive medicine under President Obama 's Affordable Care Act . The IOM says such a change would lower the rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion , help women better space out their pregnancies , and spur a number of beneficial health developments for women . The guideline is non-binding , but if the Department of Health and Human Services adopts it , insurers would have to cover 100 percent of the cost of contraceptives , with no co-pay . Is it as important to help prevent unwanted pregnancy as it is to prevent disease ?
This change is long overdue : `` Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned , '' says Vanessa Cullins in The New York Times , `` but affordable contraception can change that . '' Requiring insurers to pay for birth control for the millions of women who do n't have the money for it will prevent abortions , and `` improve the health of women and families . '' It 's the smart and caring thing to do .
`` Make birth control affordable ''
But pregnancy is `` not a disease '' : The IOM blew a chance to promote `` life-affirming and truly compassionate '' health care , says Cardinal Daniel DiNardo , chairperson of the Committee on Pro-Life Activities of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , as quoted by PR Newswire . It should be pushing real `` life-saving '' coverage for the poor , not ramming `` controversial elective practices '' down our throats . `` Pregnancy is not a disease , and fertility is not a pathological condition to be suppressed by any means technically possible . ''
`` Bishops ' pro-life chair strongly opposes recommended mandate for birth control , sterilization in private health plans ''
Conservatives oppose this guideline at their peril : Every dollar that supports family planning clinics saves an estimated $ 3.74 in health care costs associated with unwanted pregnancies , says Sharon Lerner at The Nation . And a recent survey found that `` 84 percent of respondents — including an impressive 73 percent of Republicans — support birth control as preventive care . '' Conservative groups can , and will , fight this , but they should keep in mind that the public supports this health-promoting , money-saving measure . That means jumping on board `` is n't just the right thing to do medically — it 's politically savvy , too . ''
`` Eliminate co-pays for contraception , IOM report recommends ''
Hello everyone ! First loot , first blog post !
Today I 'll show you guys my first two figmas Akiyama Mio and Nakano Azusa . I 've bought these two figures on Jungle . The figures are from the famous K-ON ! series . My favorite characters from the series are Mio , Azusa and Yui . So when I saw Mio and Azusa on Jungle , I had to get them ! I 'll give you a short review of their website .
Jungle
Jungle is a physical store in Osaka Japan and also had a website where they ship worldwide ! They have a lot of figures on their website for sale , if you ca n't find a figure on Mandarake you might need to check this website . Jungle sells pre-owned items and labels them with SEALED , A or B . A means that the item is new and only the outer box is opened , B means that the item has been removed from the package . I bought two sealed figures , somehow I refuse to buy opened boxes . For shipping they offer SAL and EMS . I went with SAL and my items arrived in 1,5 weeks . So far I think that this website is pretty nice if you just ca n't find the figures you need on other pre-owned selling websites . Why ? Jungle charges 5 % handling fee on all their orders . Also I noticed that their prices are slightly higher than for example Mandarake items . So I think Jungle is more expensive than Mandarake . Overall this website is not too bad , just grab items you really ca n't find on other websites and you 'll feel satisfied .
Akiyama Mio
Mio comes with their famous ‘ moe moe ' faces ( I wish I could give them a maid oufit .. ) , which are probably my favorite things from this figure . They also come with their bass and the bass cover . Besides their normal shoes , they also come with their school uniform shoes . Those shoes are ridiculously hard to put on ! Also the string to make them wear their bass was so difficult to put on , luckily in the end I somehow was able to string the string to the bass .
I just had to pose them like this . This is my favorite face of her , cute little blushies and oh so innocent !
Nakano Azusa
Azu-nyan comes with their kitty ears ! What would they be without their kitty ears anyway .. They also have 2 different faces to wear a ‘ go for it ! ' one and a ‘ nyaa ' one . Of course they also came with their guitar and their guitar cover . But the best thing of this figure is that I could fully pose them kittiness . They even came with their ‘ paw ' hands .
I hope you guys enjoyed my first post ! Be patient and stay curious for more !

The U.S. military is one of America 's premier leadership factories . But the product it manufactures is in decline .
Seven years ago , the number of young officers willing to recommit after their initial tours of duty dropped precipitously . Before the Iraq war , three-quarters of Army officers stayed for a career , a number that dropped to just two-thirds starting in 2006 . The broken pipeline was initially blamed on the sputtering war effort in Iraq , but in fact the problem is a deep-rooted one . The Army has bled talent for decades , a consequence of a deeply dysfunctional organization that poorly matches jobs with talent and does n't trust its officers to make choices about their own careers .
The solution , however , is n't beyond reach . The next step in the evolution of the Pentagon 's leadership system should be what I call a “ total volunteer force ” —one that treats officers as human capital with autonomy rather than as physical capital in inventory .
Let me explain . The retention crisis , even in an era of cutbacks and sequestration , is a decades-long dilemma that the military does n't often talk about . The Senate investigated the “ critical and delicate ” problem of a military brain drain as far back as 1954 , after President Eisenhower called for Congressional action . Yet after public attention flared following a 2011 survey of junior officers , retired U.S. Army general Frederick Kroesen mocked the issue in the publication ARMY , declaring that “ no other profession has developed better ways to identify , develop and reward its leaders . ”
There is at least one top military leader who will talk about the problem . In a farewell address to the cadets of West Point in Feb. 2011 , former secretary of defense Robert Gates , admired for their service under Presidents Bush and Obama , expressed their frustration . They wondered how the Army “ can break up the institutional concrete , its bureaucratic rigidity in its assignments and promotion processes , in order to retain , challenge , and inspire its best , brightest , and most-battled tested young officers ? ”
Sec . Gates understood something that neither the Army nor its critics do . Critics like to think that the most talented young leaders simply leave , whereas many generals refuse to admit any problem exists . The real problem is that the talent is bleeding inside the organization . High quit rates are just a symptom of the deeper problem that too many military members are mis-matched with their jobs .
In truth , military officers are only volunteers for one day : the day they sign up . Afterwards , they 're treated with the same kind of inflexible , coercive management that has defined militaries since history began . No electronic “ job boards ” list openings for the thousands of available jobs in the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marines . No junior officers know where their next job assignment will be , or if it will fit with their interests , strengths and talents . And no commanders are trusted to directly hire the subordinates they feel their teams need .
Rather , junior officers are generally limited to rank-ordering the base locations they prefer . Commanders are limited to making a “ by-name request ” of some officers , but this is more often than not ignored by higher-ups . Labor supply is coordinated with labor demand by large bureaucracies that have n't changed much since Harry Truman was president in the 1950s .
Why does this nonsensical and anachronistic approach persist ? The mantra from the central planners in the bowels of the Pentagon has always been that the “ needs of the military come first. ” That 's dumb . Smart organizations in the private sector have learned that putting employees ' needs first—ahead of corporate ones—only seems unproductive to short-term thinkers . Just look at the way Silicon Valley companies pamper their talent because of how it helps to maximize the bottom line . Compulsion just wo n't work in today 's labor market .
Unfortunately , most career generals think that only coercion will get fighting men and women to enter a war zone . But that 's an insult to our troops . Many generals in the 1960s warned that without a draft , the Army would never attract enough volunteer soldiers during a shooting war . Iraq and Afghanistan proved them wrong . It is motivation , not intimidation , that wins battles .
The military has changed before , and it can change again . As the Army shifted from a conscripted force to an all-volunteer one following the Vietnam War , productivity , retention , motivation and labor quality increased . Today , for example , roughly 97 percent of military enlistees are high-school graduates , which is 17 percentage points higher than the civilian average . And contrary to conventional wisdom , there are three recruits from America 's wealthiest neighborhoods for every two from its poorest ones .
Since the 1950s , America 's defense budget shrank from 17 percent of GDP to less than 4 percent today . The Pentagon has historically responded by doing more with less , focusing on quality instead of quantity . It has learned how to motivate the workers who remained , cultivating independent judgment and adaptability as key skills among its youngest officers . Now it 's time to make the Pentagon 's talent management as flexible and adaptable as its talent .

To create a “ total volunteer force , ” I believe the Pentagon needs to radically reform . That will mean giving commanders , rather than bureaucrats , hiring authority . It will require the Pentagon to establish a job board which allows qualified officers and enlistees the freedom to apply for any open position . And it will mean instituting substantive evaluations that recognize merit more than seniority .
Finally , there should be no more “ force shaping ” with incentives paid to soldiers who retire early . Rather , there should be a free market that lets officers leave if they can not find a military billet and allows former officers to return to the ranks if a commander will hire them .
It seems odd to explain to the guys in charge of our missiles that this is n't rocket science . But leadership is about more than producing great leaders . Great organizations trust those young leaders , too , especially when it comes to managing their own careers .

Nuclear power , frequently mentioned as one option for meeting future energy needs , would pose a health threat to Americans if a meltdown occurred . But despite meltdowns at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island , and many other near-miss accidents , there is another dirty little secret the nuclear industry does n't want you to know . Cancer risk from nuclear plants are n't just potential risks , they are actual risks .
Every day , reactors must routinely release a portion of radioactive chemicals into local air and water -- the same chemicals found in atomic bomb tests . They enter human bodies through breathing and the food chain . Federal law obligates nuclear companies to measure these emissions and the amounts that end up in air , water , and food , and to report them to federal regulators .
However , nuclear advocates consistently claim that these releases are below federally-permitted limits , and thus are harmless . But this thinking is a leap that ignores hard evidence from scientific studies . Now , after half a century of a large-scale experiment with nuclear power , the verdict is in : nuclear reactors cause cancer .
The claim that low doses of radiation are harmless has always been just a claim . It led to practices like routine diagnostic X-rays to the pelvis of pregnant women , until the work of the University of Oxford 's Dr. Alice Stewart found that these X-rays doubled the chance that the fetus would die of cancer as a child . Many studies later , independent experts agreed that no dose is safe . A 2005 report by a blue-ribbon panel of the National Academy of Sciences reviewed hundreds of scientific articles , and concluded that there is no risk-free dose of radiation .
Federal health officials , who should be responsible for tracking cancer near nuclear reactors and analyzing their nuclear contaminants , have ignored the dangers . The only national analysis of the topic was a 1990 study mandated by Senator Edward Kennedy , and conducted by the National Cancer Institute . But this study was biased before it even got started . A January 28 , 1988 letter to Senator Kennedy from National Institutes of Health Director Dr. James Wyngaarden brazenly declared `` The most serious impact of the Three Mile Island accident that can be identified with certainty is mental stress to those living near the plant , particularly pregnant women and families with teenagers and young children . '' Not surprisingly , the study concluded there was no evidence of high cancer rates near reactors . No updated study has since been conducted by federal officials .
With government on the sidelines , it has been up to independent researchers -- publishing results in medical and scientific journals , to generate the needed evidence . Studies were limited until the 1990s , but the few publications consistently documented high local cancer rates near reactors . Dr. Richard Clapp of Boston University found high leukemia rates near the Pilgrim plant in Massachusetts . Colorado health official Dr. Carl Johnson documented high child cancer rates near the San Onofre plant in California .
Columbia University researchers showed that cancer cases within a 10 mile radius of the Three Mile Island plant soared 64 % in the first five years after the 1979 meltdown . Following the federal government 's party line , they claimed that `` stress '' rather than radiation caused this increase . But the cat was out of the bag . Dr. Steven Wing of the University of North Carolina published a paper using the same data confirming the radiation-cancer link .
Joseph Mangano , MPH , MBA , Executive Director of the Radiation and Public Health Project , has authored 23 scientific articles since the mid-1990s documenting high local cancer rates near nukes . One study showed child cancer exceeded the national rate near 14 of 14 plants in the eastern U.S. Another showed that when U.S. nuclear plants closed , local infant deaths and child cancer cases plunged immediately after shutdown .
Other publications by Mangano have shown rising levels of radioactive Strontium-90 , emitted by reactors , in baby teeth of children living near reactors , which were closely linked with trends in childhood cancer rates .
The young are n't the only ones affected by reactor emissions . New evidence has examined adult rates of thyroid cancer , a disease especially sensitive to radiation . Thyroid is the fastest-rising cancer in the U.S. , nearly tripling since 1980 . This evidence proves that most U.S. counties with the highest thyroid cancer rates are within a 90-mile radius covering eastern Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and southern New York . This area has 16 nuclear reactors ( 13 still in operation ) at 7 plants , the densest concentration of reactors in the U.S .
A November 2007 article on U.S. child leukemia deaths updated the 1990 National Cancer Institute study and showed local rates rose as nuclear plants aged -- except near plants that shut down .
A nationwide study of current cancer rates near nukes is sorely needed . In May this year , the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) quietly announced it was commissioning an update of the 1990 National Cancer study . This sounds like a positive step . However , the NRC has long been a harsh critic of any suggestion that reactors cause cancer . This is not surprising , since the Commission receives 90 % of its funds from nuclear companies that operate reactors .
Rather than ask for competitive bids for the cancer study , the NRC simply handed the job to the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education . Oak Ridge is an Energy Department contractor in the city that has operated a nuclear weapons plant for over half a century . The `` Institute '' is merely a front for pro-nuclear forces . It has no record of publishing scientific articles on cancer rates near reactors . The whitewash is on .
Several steps must be taken urgently . President Obama , who will appoint replacements for 2 of the 5 NRC commissioners later this year , should select independent members -- not the yes men for the nuclear industry who have run the NRC for so many years . The NRC should bow out of the cancer study . Finally , Congress should appropriate funds supporting a truly independent study on cancer rates near U.S. reactors . The American public deserves to know just what these machines have done to them , so that future energy policies will better protect public health .

A rise in suicides is `` so hard to hear '' says Stephen Bell of youth mental health service Youthline .
The provisional suicide toll has risen to its highest figure since the coroner 's office started releasing the statistics .
From the year June 2014- May 2015 , 569 people died by suicide or suspected suicide .
Last year ( for the year ending 30 June 2014 ) that number was 529 .
Abby Brown Mike King pictured talking about their Key to Life charity aimed at teaching high school students about how they beat depression .
The information from the Coroner was released to New Zealand First under parliamentary questions and is a worrying development say experts .
`` It seems to have completely bucked the trend , '' says Stephen Bell of youth mental health service Youthline .
Last year 's figures had been the lowest number by two since the annual coronial figures were first produced for the 2007/2008 year .
The figures provided a breakdown of suicides by region and month , with August proving the most deadly month ( 51 deaths ) and Auckland the region with the most deaths ( 161 ) .
However , anomalies were found such as Christchurch – which has a smaller population than Wellington but had more suicides ( 49 compared to 40 ) – and Hastings which had only two fewer suicides than the bigger Hamilton .
`` It 's so hard to hear , '' says Bell .
`` I always hate the idea of trying to reduce suicide because if you say that , you are accepting there will be suicides . We 've got to aspire that no one is in the state where they want to kill themselves . ''
Suicide is the second highest way young people die in New Zealand they say .
Former comedian Mike King , who has openly talked about their own struggles with depression , reacted to the figures saying : `` Those who work in this area knew the figures last year were an anomaly . Everyone was quick to jump on last year 's figure because youth suicide had gone down but compared to the daily reports I get from communities I knew it was bad .
`` Our approach to suicide prevention could be greatly improved if we spent more time educating ordinary New Zealanders on their attitudes . Their judgmental and off-the-cuff remarks in regards to attention-seeking and cowardly behaviour – these common cliches that are thrown around – the impact is that there are 569 New Zealanders who would rather die and leave their families behind , than openly talk about their problems and be judged by other people . ''
King said : `` Its not the suicidal thoughts or depression that is killing New Zealanders it is going through that alone and seeing no hope . All the people in charge of the suicide industry who were busy two years ago telling me I was causing suicide contagion and should n't talk to the public are now running around saying hey maybe now we should start talking .
`` The only way we are going to start getting on top of these appalling figures , for youth especially , is to stop giving the youth our answers to their problem , we have to empower them to identify the problem and come up with the solution , '' King said .
The full Coroner 's annual suicide report – which breaks down the deaths in more specific trends such as age and ethnicity – will be released later this year .
The Chief Coroner , Deborah Marshall , was approached for comment but was unavailable .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde pledged to fight “ allegation by allegation ” charges of negligence when they went on trial in Paris on Monday over their role in a huge payout by the French state to business person Bernard Tapie in 2008 .
Lagarde , 60 , was France 's finance minister in the government of then-president Nicolas Sarkozy when they approved an out-of-court settlement with Tapie to end a long-running dispute between the magnate and the French state .
The decision to accept an extremely rare private arbitration ended up costing French taxpayers more than 400 million euros ( $ 424 million ) in a payout to Tapie .
Accused of negligence leading to misuse of public funds , Lagarde denies any wrongdoing . They risk up to a year in jail and a fine of 15,000 euros ( $ 15,895 ) if convicted .
Were it to happen , a maximum sentence could raise questions about the widely respected policymaker 's ability to continue as head of the Washington-based IMF , where their French predecessor Dominique Strauss Kahn quit in 2011 over a sex assault scandal .
“ I would like to show you that I am in no way guilty of negligence , but rather that I acted in good faith with only the public interest in mind , ” they said in the opening hearing .
“ Was I negligent ? No . And I will strive to convince you allegation by allegation , ” they said , expressing surprise at the harsh tone of the charges against them
Investigators have said that Lagarde 's behavior in the case went beyond simple carelessness .
Them trial is only the fifth to be held before the Cour de Justice de la Republique , a special tribunal created in 1993 to try cabinet ministers .
A panel of 15 , including 12 lawmakers from both the lower and upper houses of parliament , will hear the case , which is scheduled to run until Dec. 20 .

They are expected to focus on correspondence between Lagarde and their staff as well as the government body that manages state corporate holdings , which advised against private arbitration .
The case dates back to a time when Tapie sued the state for compensation after selling their stake in sports company Adidas to then state-owned Credit Lyonnais in 1993 .
They accused the bank of defrauding them after it resold its stake for a much higher price . With the case stuck in the courts , the two sides agreed to a private settlement and Tapie was awarded a 403 million euro payouts , including interest .
WASHINGTON -- Republicans are outraged that Democratic presidential contender Martin O'Malley cited actual scientific research in comments about how climate change has contributed to internal conflicts in Syria .
In an interview with Bloomberg on Monday , O'Malley discussed the national security implications of climate change . `` One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation state of Syria and the rise of ISIS , was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that nation , wiped out farmers , drove people to cities , created a humanitarian crisis that created the symptoms -- or rather , the conditions -- of extreme poverty that has now led to the rise of ISIS and this extreme violence , '' they said .
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called O'Malley 's comments `` absurd . ''
`` Whether it 's the weak Obama-Clinton nuclear deal that paves the way for Iran to obtain an atomic bomb or Martin O'Malley 's absurd claim that climate change is responsible for ISIS , it 's abundantly clear no one in the Democratic Party has the foreign policy vision to keep America safe , '' they said in a statement , via Fox News .
And conservative media outlets are apparently really mad that reporters , including me , have n't covered O'Malley 's comments . But here I am , covering them .
The thing is , O'Malley 's comments reflect actual scientific findings published earlier this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The paper , from researchers at Columbia University , found that an extended , severe drought in Syria -- a drought whose severity was made two to three times more likely due to climate change as it would have been otherwise -- worsened existing water security and agricultural woes and forced approximately 1.5 million more people into urban areas . This helped create internal conflict and the conditions that facilitated the growth of extremist like the Islamic State , or ISIS .
The report does n't say the drought caused the war , one of the lead authors told The Huffington Post when it was released , but does outline how it worsened conditions for people in the country .
`` We 're saying that added to all the other stressors , it helped kick things over the threshold into open conflict , '' said Richard Seager , a climate scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and a co-author of the paper .
Which is almost exactly the point O'Malley made in the Bloomberg interview .
The O'Malley campaign responded to critics on Tuesday .
Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore . Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis . “ We thought they were already in Lake Erie , we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan . This is first time there 's been an actual specimen recovered , so this is very exciting ” , they said . It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young , and somehow made it into Lake Erie . According to Dr. Polowotski , the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie , as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream . “ They are intimidated by closed-in spaces . They need a lot of room . You have to remember that this is a very big animal ” , they said . Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs . “ Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control , else there is some cause for concern ” , said Dr. Polowotski . “ Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution ” . The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and their sister Jill , both of Romeo . “ We were just , you know , taking an evening walk along the beach , heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it ” , said Bob . “ We were singing , drinking whiskey out of the bottle , not thinking about tomorrow . But something like this really does make you stop and think ” , they said . DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study .

NORML has been fighting for nearly half a century to replace our nation 's overreaching , under-serving and ( by any objective measure ) disastrous marijuana laws with a sensible , regulated retail system – and in 2014 , real change is finally upon us . The effective launch of Colorado and Washington State 's new cannabis market is a clear indication that the days of prohibition are numbered . Marijuana is now a true commercial commodity , and with that comes a new set of standards – the likes of which the industry , and the movement have never seen before .
As a result of the commercialization of this new industry , NORML is pleased to announce the launch of the NORML Business Network , a new initiative seeking to bridge consumer advocacy with the cannabis industry . The Network will be collaborating with marijuana companies and ancillary businesses that are committed to using their enterprise as a positive example of corporate social responsibility , and a platform for ending marijuana prohibition nationwide . The NORML Business Network has already partnered with Weedmaps , Marijuana.com and High Times Magazine to further promote this initiative , and to highlight other members of the NORML Business Network through their various mediums .
The NORML Business Network is a selective , industry focused , membership-based program that advocates for high industry standards , and using business as a force for change . The Network 's mission is to empower the market early on to become invested in creating a culture of self-regulation , and to encourage entities to adopt a socially conscious corporate model that integrates the interests of their customers and communities into the fabric of their business ' DNA . Similar to that of the Better Business Bureau , stores or products that carry the NORML Business Partner seal confirms that they are operating a “ values-driven ” enterprise , and are active supporters of marijuana law reform nationwide . NORML Business Partners will be required to meet certain criteria , including various market and industry qualifiers such as testing , labeling , environmental sustainability , fair wages , decent pricing and special discounts for certain populations such as seniors and veterans .
The cannabis industry is under more scrutiny than any other developing market has ever been , and it is critical for all stakeholders to remain cognizant of this enduring challenge . The public as well as lawmakers will be watching closely at how these new policies in Colorado and Washington affect the communities and environments of those states , and beyond their borders . How retail marijuana unfolds in these early years will determine the future course of legalization nationwide .
As a consumer advocacy nonprofit , NORML is dedicated to identifying and protecting all new and evolving stakeholder interests – while also continuing on the path to legalization nationwide . The organization recognizes that the implementation of Colorado and Washington State 's commercial retail cannabis market have permanently changed the scope of the consumer advocacy debate , and the NORML Business Network is a natural evolution for the forty-five year old organization . The evolution of this burgeoning industry is creating entirely new legal and logistical challenges , which call for new standards and industry accountability – and NORML will continue to advocate for consumer 's interests under a legal regime .
“ We want to recognize the positive impact these marijuana businesses are having on their communities by highlighting those who go above and beyond the letter of the law in an effort to align their economic benefits alongside the interests of their customers and communities , ” said Sabrina Fendrick , NORML 's Director of Strategic Partnerships .
The NORML Business Network will promote these good corporate citizens to a national audience , media , elected official and the public safety community , amplifying their work as positive examples of the marijuana industry . This in turn will help solidify the integrity of legalization as public policy , and ensure the sustainability of the industry as reform takes root nationwide .

Almost 500 children were abducted from the UK and taken abroad illegally last year , according to figures released to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act .
There were 336 cases of child abduction reported to authorities in the UK in 2008 , an increase of 20 % on 2005 figures . These cases involved an estimated 470 children last year . More children were taken illegally to Pakistan than any other country ( 30 cases in 2008 ) , followed by the USA ( 23 ) , Ireland ( 22 ) and Spain ( 21 ) . Other abduction hotspots included Australia , France and Egypt .
Abductions usually occur when marriages break down between couples of different nationalities , and the parent who is not awarded custody kidnaps their children . Now is peak abduction season , as children are taken abroad during the school summer holidays and not returned .
Usually , the cases are n't publicised as they are dealt with in the family courts where reporting restrictions apply to any cases involving the welfare of minors . But they are becoming increasingly common – when the Guardian spent a day in a family court in London recently , eight out of 14 cases heard involved child abduction .
The government has little power to intervene in around 40 % of all abduction cases , as they involve children being taken to countries not signed up to the Hague convention , an international treaty which obliges nations to promptly return children wrongfully retained in their jurisdiction . Experts say it is often almost impossible for mothers to get back children taken by their fathers to Islamic countries with sharia law , such as Saudi Arabia , which prioritise male parental rights .
But recently Gordon Brown and the new health secretary , Andy Burnham , have personally intervened in the case of Nadia Fawzi , then a four-year-old British girl taken from Wigan to Libya by their Libyan father .
A month ago , Burnham , the girl 's MP , flew to Tripoli for meetings with the Libyan justice ministry and police force about the case , and Gordon Brown asked the Libyan leader , Colonel Gaddafi , to help return the girl to the UK when the two met for the first time at the G8 summit in Italy .
Nadia was picked up from their home in Wigan by their father , who said they were going to a party . But instead , they drove to Manchester airport , where they were captured on CCTV buying plane tickets to Libya . Nadia has n't been home since .
Them British mother , Sarah Taylor , saw their daughter on a few occasions in the months after their abduction , but has had no contact with them since Christmas 2007 .
Taylor has spent the last two years doing everything in their power to be reunited with their now six-year-old daughter . Libya is a notoriously difficult country to negotiate with on such matters – it has not signed up to the Hague convention , and so the UK government is limited in the support it can offer .
In November 2007 , Taylor took a drastic step . They sold their house , gave up their job and moved to Libya to fight through the local courts for the custody they had already been awarded in the UK courts after their marriage to Nadia 's father broke down .
After a long and difficult battle in the labyrinthine sharia legal system , Taylor won full custody of Nadia in 2008 . But their ex-husband refused to comply with the court order , and despite quiet but firm interventions from the Foreign Office and assorted other agencies in the UK and Tripoli , they still have the little girl in their care . Or at least Taylor believes they do – no one is entirely sure where in the Libyan capital father and daughter are currently living .
Burnham told the Guardian they are hopeful that mother and daughter will soon be reunited .
They said : `` This awful injustice and crime has now been raised at the highest level and we now expect swift action . This is a story about a young girl taken illegally off the streets of my constituency and I will go to any lengths to right that wrong . ''
In 2008 , 134 out of the 336 cases of child abduction involved children taken to non-Hague countries , including Bangladesh , Russia , Iraq and Nigeria . These cases are dealt with by the Foreign Office , while Hague cases go through the Ministry of Justice in England and Wales , and the Scottish and Northern Irish court services .
Scotland dealt with nine cases last year involving 12 children . In Northern Ireland last year there were 12 reported instances , involving 20 children taken to the Republic of Ireland , the USA , Israel , Germany , Finland , Poland and France .
The increase in cases is an `` inevitable consequence of greater migration '' , according to Andy Elvin , chief executive of the charity International Social Services , which helps parents secure the return of their children . `` Child abduction is a growing trend as we have an increasing number of families where at least one parent is originally from overseas , '' they said .
Denise Carter , director of Reunite , a UK charity specialising in international parental child abduction , said : `` The increase in international travel and more and more people travelling on short-term contracts and changing their habitual residence also has an effect . ''
Figures from Reunite show that since 1995 , the number of children abducted from Britain and taken to another country has risen by 93 % .
The government 's figures clearly show the effect of EU enlargement . For example , until Latvia joined the EU in 2004 , there had been no reported cases of children being abducted there from the UK in the previous four years . But in 2005 , three cases were reported , and there has been at least one new instance every year since .
Similarly , while there were no reported abductions to Poland in 2003 , the year before the country 's EU entry , there were 10 in 2006 and 2008 . `` We expect to see more and more cases from countries like Poland as the years go on and more couples marry , have children and get divorced , '' said Elvin .
A Foreign Office spokesperson said : `` When there is no international mechanism in place , usually the left-behind parent 's only option [ other than trying to come to an agreement with the other parent ] is to file a case in the courts of the country where their child has been taken . However , pursuing such a case will often be expensive and there is no guarantee the courts will decide that the child should be returned to the UK . ''

The survival chances of crown-of-thorns starfish increase by as much as 240 % if sea-surface temperatures rise 2C , say Australian researchers
Warmer seas are creating an additional threat to the Great Barrier Reef , with new research suggesting rising temperatures are helping a key coral predator thrive .
Crown-of-thorns starfish that eat coral are more likely to survive with rising sea-surface heat levels , according to a study by the Australian Institute of Marine Science ( Aims ) .
An Aims scientist , Sven Uthicke , said a study largely carried out at the institute 's marine laboratory in Townsville showed a 2C rise in sea temperature increased the starfish 's chances of survival by up to 240 % .
“ Warmer sea temperatures were found in this study to enhance COTS [ Crown-of-thorns starfish ] survival along with other , cumulative pressures on the reef , ” they said .
“ Given that the most moderate climate change scenarios predict a 1C-2C increase in average sea temperatures , the present study further demonstrates the value of taking a holistic , multi-variable approach to understand better how cumulative factors affect the survival of species such as COTS . ”
Outbreaks of the starfish , also known as Acanthaster planci , have been instrumental in coral cover on the reef halving between 1985 and 2012 , a range of previous studies indicated . Scientists attributed 40 % of that overall decline to the starfish .
Warmer seas also kill coral through bleaching . Extensive bleaching can be triggered by as little as six weeks at temperatures of 1C-1.5C above the long-term summer maximum , according to the federal environment department .
Uthicke said scientists could better understand starfish outbreaks by recognising the synergies of sea-surface temperatures and increased nutrient flows that feed starfish larvae .
For the study , Uthicke and other scientists used the institute 's national sea simulator , which enables them to manipulate environmental factors to conduct large , long-term experiments on the impact of complex environmental changes .
The study was published on Thursday in the online peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports .
Unesco 's world heritage committee is due to publish a draft report on the Great Barrier Reef in mid-May , and a decision on whether the site should be listed as “ in danger ” is to be made later this year .
The farmers ' main demands were :
( 1 ) Support price for cotton at 1200 per 20 kg , and Rs . 1000 per 20 kg for groundnut ,
( 2 ) No de-commanding of Narmada waters and diversion for industries ,
( 3 ) Repeal of draconian anti-farmer laws such as Special Investment Region ( SIR ) Act , and Irrigation Act , and
( 4 ) Immediate withdrawal of the Ordinance making the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Act meaningless .
`` It has become the standard practice for the Government of Gujarat to clamp down on demands of the poor and toiling people of Gujarat rather than addressing '' , NAPM said , adding , `` This Government believes in ruling via Ordinances on the one hand , and organising meaning public relations jamboorees - all at tax payers ' expense . ''
Condemning the `` wanton attack on the rights of the people and suppression of our democratic rights to assemble and protest '' , it said , `` We will continue to protest this loot being promoted by the government in name of investors summit and development of Gujarat and nation . ''
At a time when farmers across Gujarat were being detained for demanding a fair price for their produce , red carpet was being spread for national and international corporate honchos , the National Alliance of People 's Movements ( NAPM ) has said in a stongly worded statement condemning the arrest of farmers in Gujarat . Qualifying the Vibrant Gujarat business summit , which opened on Sunday in Gandhinagar , as “ jamboree ” , NAPM said , wondered if it `` is a crime to raise the issue of farmers ' suicides and low cotton prices '' . The non-party platform Sanyukta Khedut Sangharsh Samiti was only planning to hand over a memorandum to the Gujarat Government , NAPM , which is the apex body of tens of people 's organisations across India , added. “ Farmers have been preparing and heading for their action spot in Ahmedabad in thousands since morning ” , NAPM said , adding , `` In a wanton display of its paranoia as well as dictatorial tendencies the Government first tried to scare away bus and other transporters and attempted to force them to cancel farmers ' bookings . But farmers demonstrated their resolve by finding other means to reach the appointed spot . Meanwhile , thousands of farmers are being detained in tens of places across Gujarat '' .First , Shivlal Vekaria ( ex-MP ) and Chandulal Shingala were detained in Rajkot and then followed the detention of hundreds of farmers in various districts . In the dead of the night - around 12.30 am - Sagar Rabari and Lakhan Musafir were arrested on January 10 . Other prominent farmers being detained include Mansukhbhai ( Rajkot ) , Pradyumansinh and Ramdevsinh Chudasma ( Dholera ) , Mahendrasinh Karmariya , Nipul Patel , Yakub Gurji ( Bharuch ) , and Lalji Desai ( Becharaji-Mandal ) .This apart , Mansa MLA Amitbhai , Dehgam MLA Kaminiben and Jashubhai Rana of Gandhinagar were arrested . Persis Ginwala ( Jamin Adhikar Angolan Gujarat or JAAG ) , Krishnakant and Swati Desai ( NAPM ) were also detained in the morning .

North Korea 's new leader was among the public mourners as the body of Kim Jong-il was shown lying in state on Korean television today . It was the first public appearance by Kim Jong-un since their father 's death on Saturday and their ascension to the leadership of their country and the Worker 's Party .
Korea Central Television of the North aired still images of the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang , where Kim 's body was put on display . It 's the same place where the body of their father , the revolutionary founder of North Korea , Kim Il Sung , has been lying in a glass tomb since their death in 1994 . North Korea has announced an official 11-day mourning period with a state funeral to be held on December 28 .
The visit by Kim Jong-un was also seen as public display meant to demonstrate that they are now the one in charge , though outside observers still seem uncertain about the true status of the regime . State media has also started referring to Jong-un as “ another leader sent from the heaven , '' an description that emphasizes their rightful place in the line of succession begun by their grandfather , ( the `` Great Leader '' ) and their father ( `` Dear Leader . '' )
The death of Kim is being portrayed as a giant intelligence failure both by the South Koreans and Americans , who appear to have been caught completely unaware by the announcement of their passing , even though Kim had been dead for nearly 48 hours at the time it was revealed . It is n't the first time they 've been unable to penetrate the inner workings of this highly secretive government , but given its instability , its massive military and its ( still unknown ) nuclear capabilities , North Korea 's wall of secrecy has officials in the West understandably on edge .
South Korea officially expressed condolences to the North Korean people , but will not send a delegation to the funeral , though North Korea say no foreign dignitaries will be invited .
Update 8:21 a.m. : The AP posted a video of the public displaying of Dear Leader 's body :

× Expand OFL COMMUNICATIONS Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders has described their knowledge of the Dafonte Miller incident as minimal .
It was an astonishing admission . When Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders was first asked in July about charges laid by the Special Investigations Unit ( SIU ) against constable Michael Theriault in the beating of Whitby teen Dafonte Miller ( allegedly with a steel pipe ) , the chief described their knowledge of the incident as minimal .
That 's a scary thought because it can only mean one of two things : that the chief 's own officers kept the incident from them ( which seems highly unlikely but not completely out of the realm of possibility ) – in which case their grip on the force is more tenuous than any of us thought . Or , Saunders is deflecting responsibility .
Saunders said something else that was just as remarkable for anyone concerned about their commitment to police oversight : that the SIU was not called by Toronto police to investigate the incident involving Theriault essentially because the unit 's mandate only applies to cases involving on-duty cops and Theriault was reportedly off-duty and did not identify themselves as a police officer during the confrontation with Miller .
That 's not the understanding of the SIU 's mandate of Miller 's lawyer , Julian Falconer , or what the SIU 's mandate actually states .
The FAQs section on the agency 's website says that “ the SIU will not normally investigate conduct by off-duty police officers unless police equipment or property is involved , or the off-duty officer 's status as a police officer has been implicated in the course of the incident , such as may occur if an off-duty officer identifies themselves or themselves as a police officer. ” According to Falconer , Theriault identified themselves as a police officer during the Miller incident .
The SIU 's mandate is otherwise clear : it 's statutory jurisdiction “ does not differentiate between on-duty and off-duty police officers . ”
Police Services Act regulation 267/10 states that a chief of police should err on the side of due diligence if they or they have any doubt the duty to notify the SIU . It states that a chief of police should report any incident “ that may reasonably be considered to fall within the investigative mandate of the SIU . ”
Truth is , Toronto police have been playing cat and mouse with the SIU and the duty to report ever since the unit 's creation in the early 90s .
In the early days of the SIU , it was n't unheard of for police to wait hours to report an incident involving one of their own , long after any officers involved had been taken from the scene and , in some cases , colluded with other officers to make their notes on an incident .
The police 's historical reluctance to notify the SIU extends also to their duty to cooperate in SIU investigations .
Section 113 ( 9 ) of the Police Services Act states that all members of a police service – that means higher-ups in the chain of command and not just subject officers or witness officers who may be actors in an SIU investigation – “ shall cooperate fully ” with the SIU .
The section has been the subject of much legal interpretation by police forces and police unions . As a result , regulations have been written over the years setting out what the duty to “ cooperate fully ” means . It 's a different thing in practice than its intended meaning in the Police Services Act .
For example , subject officers , those who are the subject of an SIU probe , are not required to submit to an interview with the SIU , or turn in their notes to the SIU during an investigation .
Witness officers , those who may be involved in an incident but are not the subject of possible criminal charges , “ have a duty ” to submit to an interview with the SIU and turn over their notes . But history with the Toronto force is that this does n't always happen in a timely fashion , or sometimes at all .
During their tenure as director , Ian Scott wrote former Toronto police chief Bill Blair on more than 125 occasions over the failure of officers to cooperate with SIU investigations . The current SIU director , Tony Loparco , reportedly wrote Saunders only a few months before the Miller incident about a case involving Toronto police in which SIU protocols were ignored .
But the SIU has no power to hold chiefs accountable . Nor can the SIU complain about a chief 's reluctance to investigate police refusal to cooperate with the SIU to a higher authority , like the Ontario Civilian Police Commission .
While charges have now been laid against Theriault , there has been no word on whether the 15 Durham officers who responded to the scene and initially laid charges against Miller ( which were later withdrawn ) were investigated . Or , for that matter , whether officers higher up in the chain of command in both the Durham and Toronto forces who knew about the incident and failed to report it to the SIU are part of the independent review now ordered by Saunders and turned over to Waterloo police .
According to Falconer , none of the officers who responded to the scene interviewed two civilian witnesses to the confrontation . They have written letters to Saunders and Durham chief Paul Martin asking for an explanation .
“ How many times do we have to have police authorities flouting the law before they are actually held accountable by being charged themselves ? ” asks Falconer . That is the question .

It had been previously thought that this animal , also known as the Irish Elk all but died out at around the time of the end of last Ice Age about 10,300 years ago . Picture : The Siberian Times
A team of Siberian scientists is among those that have contributed to breakthrough research on the extinction of a giant deer that once roamed the Earth .
It had been previously thought that this animal , also known as the Irish Elk , a massive creature that stood 7ft ( 2 meters ) tall and had antlers up to 10ft ( up to 3.5 meters ) wide , all but died out at around the time of the end of last Ice Age about 10,300 years ago .
Distinctive animals because of their sheer size , they first appeared 400,000 years ago and were common in Ireland , Britain , and mainland Europe and Asia . However now new data suggests not only did they live longer than that , but also survived in Siberia in the Holocene Era , about 9,000 years ago , much further than anyone ever knew .
Indeed , in an article published in the highly-ranked scientific journal , Quaternary Science Reviews , the experts have extended the early Holocene habitat of the animal at least 2,400km to the east .
The development comes following analysis of fossils found at various locations in Siberia .

Dr Yaroslav Kuzmin , a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Geology and Mineralogy in Novosibirsk , Russia , said : 'We can today significantly update the model of the final extinction of the giant deer .
'Previously we knew that the habitat of giant deer was dramatically reduced from about 12,000 years ago . It was also known that about 10,300 years ago in Western and Northern Europe , including the British Isles and Scandinavia , existed one of the last habitats of the deer . The last 'stronghold ' of giant deer was identified in the Trans-Urals region of Asia , where it lived until 7,500 years ago , as it was published in one of the top scientific journals , Nature , in 2004 , by Dr Anthony J. Stuart ( now at Durham University , UK ) and their colleagues .
'But now we have confirmed that there were at least two habitats : the European and Siberian . '
The emergence of an unknown population of giant deer across Siberia thousands of years after the species was said to have died in this region has come from the discovery of remains in various parts of the western and eastern Siberia .
Yaroslav Kuzmin and the skeleton of the deer dated back to 7,500 year in the Ekaterinburg Nature Museum . Picture : Yaroslav Kuzmin
In 2004 , a British-Russian team of scientists analysed the remains of a deer found in 1886 , about 130km east of Ekaterinburg in the Trans-Urals region , and said they believed this animal dated back to 7,500 years . This unexpected result was subsequently published in Nature by A.J . Stuart and co-authors .
Now examinations of other bones and fossils found in Siberia have confirmed that theory and revealed that the Irish Elk survived long after the Ice Age far from its European home .
Among the remains found over the past 15 years are : 1 ) fragment of antler discovered at the Sopka 2 ancient cemetery in Baraba steppe , in Western Siberia , and 2 ) a complete upper jaw with teeth in a burial ground called Preobrazhenka 6 in the same region . The main cultural remains from these sites are associated with the Bronze Age which is dated to no older than about 4500 years ago .

In 2012 , work on the construction of a reservoir and dam for the Boguchany hydroelectric station on the Angara River , in Eastern Siberia , uncovered more bones , including six joint neck vertebrae .
At the site of Sosnovy Tushamsky , located on a large island in the main channel of the Angara , six more bones were found . And on Ust-Talaya , on the left bank of the Angara River , four neck vertebrae and other remains were unearthed .
Dr Kuzmin said : 'It was intriguing . No one had found giant deer remains before in this area , though palaeontologists worked there rather actively .
'The second thing was that all the findings were made at archaeological sites . They seemed to us rather young , not older than about 4,000 to 6,000 years old . These new findings were a kind of trigger in our work : again giant deer remains at possibly young archaeological sites . We needed to solve this puzzle .
'In Eastern Siberia , on the Angara River , the fossils were found 'in situ ' , in other words , they had not been moved from their original place of deposition . The cervical vertebrae were together , lying in the anatomical position , meaning that initially it was a whole piece of giant deer meat , with the muscles and tendons , just thrown on this place for some unknown purpose .
'On the Western Siberian sites we saw another picture . There , people obviously found the fossils in some other place and brought them to their settlements , as some interesting thing or as the object of worship . There is also a possibility that these bones belong to the older cultural component , calls Neolithic , which is represented at these sites by random artefacts . It was clear that the animal had not been killed by those people , it had died in some other place .
'In Eastern Siberia ancient people obviously hunted these giant deer as they existed together at the same time . '

They added : 'Prominent scientist and the expert in the field of radiocarbon dating Prof. Johannes van der Plicht ( University of Groningen , the Netherlands ) was also intrigued with these findings and agreed to help us with radiocarbon dating . After we got results , it became clear that the giant deer lived in Siberia in the times of Early Holocene .
'The latest date we have got for the fossil found at Preobrazhenka 6 is that they are 8,800 years old , while the finding from the Sopka 2 site , also in the Baraba steppe region , is relatively 'young ' as well at 8,900 years old . The dating of the fossils from the Angara River were also surprising . The ‘ youngest ' date is 10,400 years ago . '
What the findings show is that the Irish Elk , presumed to have died in Europe and become extinct at the very end of the Ice Age , was alive and well in Siberia thousands of years later .
Prof. Johannes van der Plicht ( left ) and Dr Yaroslav Kuzmin ( right ) . Picture : Yaroslav Kuzmin
Dr Kuzmin said : 'We do not know if the Siberian habitat was continuous or consisted of two separate sub-habitats : one in central Western Siberia and the Trans-Urals , and a second one in the middle course of the Angara River .
'We need somehow to fill in the gaps in our knowledge about the giant deer habitat and its migration .
'The other thing we need to do , and we are going to start this work soon , is to obtain the direct radiocarbon dates for several known findings of the giant deer fossils in Siberia .
'We plan to make a big review on this as the continuing of the topic , as it seems to us very promising . '

The giant deer is a distant relative of the modern fallow deer . Its height was almost two metres , and the huge antlers reached a span of up to 3.5 metres . The remains of the giant deer were found everywhere in Europe , particularly in the bogs of Ireland , which led to their name of Irish Elk .
Because of the size and structure of the antlers , scientists have concluded that they lived in open landscapes and fed mainly on herbaceous vegetation , rather than the branches of trees or shrubs .
The new study on the giant deer is already available in the Quaternary Science Review .
President Bill Clinton promotes welfare reform / The Washington Post
Ever since the welfare reform measure passed in 1996 , its central tenet — that cash assistance should be dispersed only on the condition that recipients move toward employment — has become a near-consensus in Washington .
But the rule has its critics . The University of Michigan 's Luke Schaefer and Harvard 's Kathryn Edin have found that extreme poverty — families living under $ 2 a day — shot up after the bill passed , indicating that it pulled the rug out from under a number of very vulnerable people . But there 's also a more general argument to be made that assistance to the poor should n't come with those strings .
A new working paper from economists Nicola Pavoni , Ofer Setty and Giovanni Violante adds some quantitative weight to that critique . They built a model designed to determine the `` optimal '' welfare system , the one that maximized the utility — that is , happiness , or degree of getting what you want — across the economy .
They compare a number of possible solutions . On one extreme , there 's pure , unconditional cash transfers , in which the government simply distributes money without any requirements to needy persons . On the other , there 's what the authors call `` mandatory work '' , in which needy people receive public works jobs that they must keep receiving assistance .
But there are a lot of options in between , including unemployment insurance , part-time public works , full-time but temporary public works , and extensive government job search assistance . Which one is best for a given country depends on a number of factors , but the authors focus on two : the skill level of workers , and the amount of money the government has to spend . Here 's what they find :
Data : Pavonni , Setty , and Violante . Graphic : Dylan Matthews
The numbers in the authors ' data are particular to their model and do n't tell us a whole lot about real-world policies , but there are some very interesting implications here . One is that when the government ca n't afford generous benefits , it 's cheaper for it to provide assistance in the form of public works jobs rather than through cash assistance . This is something public works advocates have been saying forever . It was born out to some extent in the subsidized work program that the nation 's stimulus funding provided to welfare recipients , which created jobs more efficiently than any other stimulus component . That 's not a true public works program , but it 's closer to it than any other recent policy , and it showed in the results .
The second takeaway is that the more skilled the population is , the more important it is to get them off government assistance and into private work . That 's because high-skilled workers are more productive and thus can produce more output both for themselves and the economy at large when in private jobs , rather than in public works or under government assistance .
Designing effective welfare programs that help people out of poverty without creating perverse incentives is quite difficult , and Pavoni , Setty , and Violante do a strong job of illustrating that complexity .
CHIANG RAI — Netizens ' hope to see a white winter melted away today .
Following snowballing rumors on social media that northern Thailand would soon be blanketed in snow , meteorologist Sri Chaiyathon said it 's not going to happen , because it 's not possible .
Snowy speculation first surfaced Jan. 22 when some Pantip users noticed snow forecast by some online services over some parts of the north such as Doi Inthanon , the nation 's highest peak . Subzero temperatures recorded in the northern mountains also fueled imaginations .
But snow needs more than below-freezing temperatures , Sri said , including low-altitude clouds and other climate factors not found in Thailand .
Nonetheless , a small solace for cold-loving Thais : Sri said the cold spell will continue a few more days thanks to cold winds blowing from Myanmar .
FreeMeteo.com perpetuates the false notion that snow is coming to northern Thailand .

Dear Chutzpanium , Purim is a sort of Halloween for Jews , celebrating their survival at the first attempted genocide of the Jews . During their exile in Persia , Haman , a servant to the king of Persia , convinced the king to kill all of the Jews . The king had married a Jewish woman named Esther , and they and a Jew called Mordecai ( maybe their cousin or previous husband ) convinced the king to intercede eventually . There was a fight and the Jews won , killing all of the anti-semites that presented themselves.Nowadays , this event is celebrated sort of like Halloween , where people dress up and party . In fact , it is a mitzvah , or one of the extra commandments for Jews , to get ultra drunk on this day , so much so that they can not recognize the difference to between `` Cursed be Haman '' and `` Blessed be Mordecai '' . People generally wear costumes and drink until they are , as said in Yiddish , Shikkur . This holiday is called Purim , and is my favourite Jewish holiday . Here are some videos : Here is a really drunk guy falling over on Rotschilds.Here was a really cool exposition of Matkot , a sort of beach tennis popular in Israel . It 's across the street on Rotschilds in Tel Aviv.Here are some old folks singing songs and drinking to celebrate the holiday.Here are some Hare Krishnas , singing and dancing on Shabbat.Well , I hope you all have enjoyed !

Stephen Mabbutt , 57 , from Charlton , near Banbury , could also hear their own heart beating .
Mr Mabbutt first experienced symptoms six years ago , when they felt a dull ache in the side of their head .
GPs treated them with nasal sprays and antibiotics , but their hearing deteriorated . Mr Mabbutt was eventually diagnosed with an unusual ear condition in which sounds inside the body are heard very loudly . The condition meant that the noise from chewing food became deafening .
Their symptoms worsened to the extent where loud noises caused dizziness and their vision blurred .
Mr Mabbutt told the BBC : `` When I raised my voice I could hear it reverberating in my head and the vibrations made my vision vibrate .
`` Eventually I could hear my heart beating and my eyes moving in their sockets . It was really distracting . ''
Mr Mabbutt was referred to Martin Burton , a surgeon from the Oxford Radcliffe Hospital who helped establish the Cochrane Ear , Nose and Throat Disorders Group . A CT scan found perforations inside the semicircular canals inside Mr Mabbutt 's ear .
They were diagnosed with superior canal dehiscence syndrome ( SCDS ) , a rare condition discovered by American surgeon Lloyd B Minor in 1995 , which is thought to only effect one in 500,000 a year in Britain .
The operation to cure the problem involved a 5cm ( 2in ) incision behind the ear , making a channel through the bone to find the `` balance organ '' and using the patient 's own bone to create a seal around the defect , the BBC said .
It was carried out by Richard Irving , an expert at the Birmingham Ear Clinic .
`` It 's made a big difference to my life . I feel a different person all round , '' Mr Mabbutt said .
Last week , Microsoft announced some pretty fundamental changes in how SQL Server 2012 will be licensed compared to previous versions of SQL Server . With SQL Server 2012 , there will be three main Editions of SQL Server . These are Enterprise Edition , Business Intelligence Edition , and Standard Edition . Data Center Edition and Workgroup Edition are gone ( both of which are no big loss in my opinion ) . Developer and Express Editions will still be available , along with Web Edition for hosting providers .
Rather than the old familiar socket-based licensing used in SQL Server 2008 R2 and below , SQL Server 2012 will use a combination of core-based and Server + Client Access License ( CAL ) based licensing , depending on which Edition you buy ( and which choice you make for Standard Edition ) . With Standard Edition , you can choose core-based licensing or Server + CAL-based licensing . With Business Intelligence Edition , you have to use Server + CAL-based licensing , while Enterprise Edition requires the use of core-based licensing . Standard Edition is the base edition , with a limit of 16 physical processor cores . Microsoft has not announced whether there will be a RAM limit for Standard Edition ( like the 64GB RAM limit in SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition ) . Business Intelligence Edition includes all of the functionality of Standard Edition , plus extra BI features and functionality . Enterprise Edition includes everything in BI Edition , plus all of the extra Enterprise Edition features and functionality . Enterprise Edition is the top of the line edition of SQL Server 2012 that will now get everything that was in SQL Server 2008 R2 Data Center Edition .
If you are using core-based licensing ( like you must for Enterprise Edition ) , each physical socket in your server must use a minimum of four core licenses . That means if you have old hardware that uses dual-core processors , you will still have to buy four core licenses for each socket . That is yet another reason to not use ancient hardware for a new version of SQL Server ! Any Intel Xeon processor that only has two physical cores will be at least four-five years old by the time SQL Server 2012 is released , so it really should be retired . Keep in mind that only physical cores count for licensing purposes ( on non-virtualized servers ) , so hyper-threading comes for free .
Core licenses will be sold in two-core packs , again with a minimum of four-cores per physical socket . The full retail license cost per physical core is $ 6874.00 for SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition . This is pretty grim news for AMD , with their higher physical core counts and lower per socket performance compared to Intel . The table below shows the cost differential in pretty graphic detail .
Processor Cores Per Socket Cost Total Sockets Total License Cost/Server Intel Xeon X5690 6 $ 41,244 2 $ 82,488 Intel Xeon E5-2690 8 $ 54,992 2 $ 109,984 Intel Xeon X7560 8 $ 54,992 4 $ 219,968 Intel Xeon E7-4870 10 $ 68,740 4 $ 274,960 AMD Opteron 6180SE 12 $ 82,488 4 $ 329,952 AMD Opteron 6276 16 $ 109,984 4 $ 439,936
For most OLTP workloads , you would be far better off from a performance perspective with a two-socket Intel Xeon X5690 server than you would be with a four-socket AMD Opteron 6180SE server . The extremely large license cost difference between those two choices makes Intel an even more compelling choice .
One way to somewhat confirm this assessment is to look at TPC-E scores for different systems and divide them by the total physical core count for the system ( not by the thread-count ) . Looking at the table below , it seems like a two-socket Intel system is a pretty good choice .
System Processor TPC-E Score Total Cores Score/Core HP ProLiant DL380 G7 Server Intel Xeon X5690 1284.14 12 107.01 HP ProLiant DL580 G7 Server Intel Xeon E7-4870 2454.51 40 61.36 HP ProLiant DL585 G7 AMD Opteron 6176SE 1400.14 48 29.17
Here are the links to the specific TPC-E Submissions that I refer to in the table above :
HP ProLiant DL380 G7 Server
HP ProLiant DL580 G7 Server
HP ProLiant DL585 G7
Of course , a new two socket servers will have a lower total RAM limit than a new four socket servers . For example , a two socket Xeon X5690 would be limited to 288GB of RAM , which is probably enough for most workloads . A two socket server will also have less total I/O capacity than a new four-socket server because it will have fewer PCI-E expansion slots . Still , you can pretty easily get 5-6GB/sec of sequential throughput out of a modern two socket servers , which should be plenty for most workloads . Once the Intel 32nm Sandy Bridge-EP Xeon E5-2690 is released in Q1 of 2012 , the wisdom of choosing a two-socket Intel based server will be even more clear .

The Florida Supreme Court held today in Delva v. Continental Group , Inc. ( SC12-2315 ) , that the Florida Civil Rights Act ( FCRA ) , sections 760.01-760.11 , Fla. Stat . , which in part prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of sex , encompasses discrimination on the basis of pregnancy .
A previous post provides a background to the case and summarizes oral arguments .
The uncertainty as to whether pregnancy discrimination was covered under FCRA arose from the fact that FCRA and its predecessor were modeled in part on Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which was found to not prohibit discrimination on the basis of pregnancy as a per se form of sex discrimination by the U.S. Supreme Court in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert , 429 U.S. 125 , 145 ( 1976 ) . Title VII was subsequently amended by Congress to specifically include pregnancy discrimination as a form of sex discrimination , while FCRA 's predecessor statute was not .
Florida 's Third and Fourth District Courts of Appeal were divided on how to interpret this revision to Title VII and its impact on FCRA . The Fourth District Court of Appeal in Carsillo v. City of Lake Worth found that since the Congressional amendment to Title VII was presented as clarifying the original intent behind the law , and since FCRA is patterned after Title VII , FCRA encompasses discrimination on the basis of pregnancy as well . 995 So.2d 1118 ( Fla. 4th DCA 2008 ) . By contrast , the Third District Court of Appeal in Delva v. Continental Group , Inc. , held below in this case that FCRA does not cover pregnancy discrimination because it was not modified to include it explicitly , as was Title VII . 96 So.3d 956 ( Fla. 3d DCA 2012 ) .
In considering the scope of the prohibition on sex discrimination under FCRA , Justice Pariente , writing for the majority , found that “ the statutory phrase making it an “ unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discriminate . . . because of . . . sex , ” as used in the FCRA , includes discrimination based on pregnancy , which is a natural condition and primary characteristic unique to the female sex. ” ( Op . at 2 ) .
The Court pointed out that the expressed legislative intent is for FCRA to be interpreted liberally . Section 760.01 ( 3 ) , Fla. Stat . The Court adopted the reasoning of the Massachusetts Supreme Court in Mass . Elec . Co. v. Mass . Comm'n Against Discrimination , which when considering a similar law held that because the ability to become pregnant is a primary characteristic of the female sex , and is unique to it , any discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is discrimination that uses sex as the basis of discrimination . 375 N.E.2d 1192 , 1198 ( Mass . 1978 ) .
The Court asserted that discrimination based on pregnancy is in fact discrimination based on sex because it is discrimination as to a natural condition unique to only one sex and that arises “ because of [ an ] individual 's . . . sex . ”
The lone dissent by Chief Justice Polston posited that the term “ pregnancy ” should not be read into FCRA as it was not explicitly included in the statute .
AT & T does n't want any rules preventing it from choosing which online video services count against its customers ' data caps .
AT & T 's `` Sponsored Data '' program already charges businesses , often in the ad industry , for the right to deliver services without counting against customers ' mobile data caps . AT & T could potentially charge online video streaming services for exemptions from the caps imposed on AT & T home broadband subscribers as well or exempt its own online services from caps .
Though AT & T does n't appear to have done this yet , the company this week asked the FCC to make sure it 's allowed to do so . AT & T 's request came after a group of companies and consumer advocacy organizations asked the Federal Communications Commission to prevent AT & T from granting data cap exemptions .
`` To the extent that AT & T uses usage-based tracking , metering , or billing on its Broadband Internet Access Service , it shall not exempt any video service offered over broadband from such tracking , metering , or billing , '' said a May 12 filing by Cogent , Dish , Free Press , New America 's Open Technology Institute , and Public Knowledge . The groups proposed that the FCC add that text as a condition on AT & T 's proposed acquisition of satellite TV provider DirecTV . Separately , Netflix has argued that AT & T could use data caps and usage-based pricing methods to `` advantage its own services '' and `` slow the development '' of online video providers that compete against traditional pay-TV .
AT & T urged the FCC to reject the proposed condition in a filing on Tuesday . The company pointed out that the FCC 's net neutrality rules do n't specifically bar such data cap exemptions ; instead , the FCC reserved the right to review specific practices to determine whether data caps are being used to harm competitors and consumers .
`` The record does not support Opponents ' request that AT & T be barred from exempting any online video service from any usage-based tracking , metering , or billing in its broadband services , '' AT & T wrote . `` Opponents offer no reason for the Commission to reverse these very recent conclusions and issue a blanket , abstract prohibition that would apply only to AT & T . Doing so would deprive AT & T customers of service offerings tailored to fit their usage and their budget . It would also distort competition by hindering AT & T 's efforts to close the gap and compete with cable 's higher-speed broadband products . ''
AT & T wrote that its broadband data limits are high enough to `` accommodate the great majority of customers . '' Broadband providers with caps `` that significantly impinge on the ability of customers to enjoy OVD [ online video distribution ] products will not be able to attract new customers or even to retain existing ones , '' AT & T wrote .
AT & T 's caps are 150GB per month for DSL subscribers , 250GB per month for U-verse , 500GB or 1TB for GigaPower , with overage fees of $ 10 per additional 50GB .
The data caps and overage charges encourage `` more efficient use of the network and ensures that lighter users of broadband services are not forced to subsidize the very heaviest users , '' AT & T wrote .
AT & T did not reveal any specific plans to exempt video services from caps , but noted that it is striking deals with certain online video providers to make it easier for customers to access the services . `` The record contains evidence of agreements between AT & T and OVD providers that make it easier for AT & T broadband customers to use OVD services , and AT & T 's recently announced deal with Hulu is further evidence of that continued commitment , '' AT & T wrote . `` To that end , AT & T will continue to have a strong incentive to implement any usage-based data policies in a way that accommodates its customers ' usage of OVD services . ''
AT & T announced its deal with Hulu earlier this month , saying an integrated offering will be available to customers later this year . AT & T did not say whether Hulu will be exempt from AT & T data caps . We asked AT & T today whether Hulu or any other video services will be exempt from AT & T data caps but have not heard back yet .
AT & T also offers its own online streaming video service to U-verse customers , but notes on the product page that `` data charges may apply . '' Using this service does count against AT & T 's caps , both on mobile and home broadband .
While AT & T 's Sponsored Data program for mobile requires payment to be exempt from data caps , T-Mobile US has been exempting a variety of streaming music services from its LTE data limits without requiring payment .
AT & T 's latest filing also urges the FCC to reject Netflix 's proposal to prevent AT & T from charging online content providers for network interconnection .
Brittney Powell , 20 , was arrested after police say they let a 12-year-old girl drive their car , causing a crash that injured several people .
PORT ST. LUCIE , Fla. - A Florida woman has been arrested after police said they let a 12-year-old girl drive their car , causing a crash .
Brittney Powell , 20 , of Port St. Lucie , was arrested Tuesday on a charge of allowing an unlicensed person to drive a car .
Port St. Lucie police Sgt . Frank Sabol said officers were called to a crash shortly after 6:30 p.m. at Northeast Airoso Boulevard and Southeast St. James Drive .
When officers arrived , they discovered that a 12-year-old girl was behind the wheel of a car that struck an SUV at the intersection .
Sabol said Powell was in the front passenger seat , while a 7-year-old girl and an 11-year-old girl were in the back seat .
Powell , the 12-year-old driver and the two other girls were taken to a nearby hospital . The driver of the SUV and their two children were also taken to the hospital . None of the injuries were considered life-threatening .
According to an arrest report , the 12-year-old girl told police at the hospital that Powell asked them `` if they wanted to learn to drive today . '' The girl said they did n't , but Powell persisted and told them to drive to a Circle K gas station to get something to drink .
Powell had the girl drive back after leaving the Circle K , resulting in the crash , the report said .
Sabol said neither Powell nor the 12-year-old girl were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash . Powell was also issued a traffic citation .

Today is the 29th of September 2014 , and it is one month before the anniversary of the first Bitcoin ATM installation in Vancouver . Let 's they how far we are now .
Recently we 've added a new page on the site called Charts where we collect all the metrics about the Bitcoin ATM industry . The advantage of this statistics is that it is online and shows always up-to-date state of the Bitcoin ATM industry . In combination with the information about Bitcoin ATM installations per manufacturers , it gives a very solid base for understanding how we progress .
Number of Bitcoin ATMs Installed
At the moment there are 248 Bitcoin ATMs installed across the globe . The chart of increasing number of Bitcoin ATMs over time shows that although the growth is not exactly linear , but very close it . This can change quite quickly as there are new Bitcoin ATMs players come into the market . For example , recently BitOcean announced new two-way Bitcoin ATM or Diamond Circle installed their first cashless Bitcoin ATM in Australia , where you can buy bitcoins using your credit card .
This information can be checked with split into main Bitcoin ATM manufacturers on this growth chart .
Bitcoin ATM Installation Speed
This gauge shows the speed how many there are Bitcoin ATM installations during the last week . Comparison is done with the speed over the last two months ( which is taken as the scale for the gauge ) . Normally we are not below the 1 Bitcoin ATM / day mark with sometimes increase to about 1.5 Bitcoin installations per day .
Share of Bitcoin ATM installation by Manufacturer
This chart shows the distribution of the market share among the main Bitcoin ATM producers . At the moment the leading position is taken by Lamassu with almost 34 % of the market . It is followed by Robocoin , Skyhook and Bitaccess , which have similar share of 15-16 % .
Bitcoin ATMs by Geographical Position
In this section you can check how the Bitcoin ATMs are spread on the Continents and by the Country . As it is seen almost half of all Bitcoin ATMs are located in the North America ( 47 % ) . It is followed by Europe with 30 % of all Bitcoin ATMs and Asia with 15 % .
Looking at the number of Bitcoin ATM installations by Country , the leading are United States with 58 ATMs , and Canada with 54 installations . Then they are followed by Australia ( 17 ) , United Kingdom ( 11 ) , Netherlands ( 11 ) , Singapore ( 10 ) , and Finland ( 8 ) .

Caregivers at an Indiana hospital gave a woman facing rectal cancer the time of their life .
Caregivers at Hendricks Regional Hospital provided patient Brenda Griffith , of Pittsboro , a sunset ride in a hot air balloon this month . It had been a lifelong wish .
“ I 'm scared of heights , but I 'm going to do it , ” Griffith told WTHR .
According to the local TV station , Griffith had a conversation with their cancer navigator , Eva Burgan , who asked if there was something they always wished to do .
“ She just makes all these notes all the time , because she 's a cancer navigator , and they make all these notes all the time and the next thing I know , I 've got someone knocking on the door and saying , ‘ Hey ! We got you a balloon ride ! ' , ” Griffith added .
Burgan , who said she 's worked with Griffith for six years , shared their request with a colleague . After texting each other and partnering with a generous donor , they worked with Firefly Balloon Rides and RE/MAX Centerstone to make the trip a reality .
“ Brenda is a beloved patient at Hendricks Regional Health who was diagnosed with rectal cancer six years ago . They recently found out their cancer has metastasized . Along their cancer journey , she 's formed many wonderful relationships with our team , ” the hospital posted on its Facebook page .

Amber Hearn scored New Zealand 's equaliser to force a penalty shootout against Iceland at the Algarve Cup in Portugal .
New Zealand 's Football Ferns have been denied the bronze medal at the Algarve Cup after losing a penalty shootout to Iceland .
The scores were locked at 1-1 at the end of 90 minutes on Thursday ( NZ time ) .
No extra time was played with penalties immediately ordered to break the deadlock at the tournament in Portugal .
New Zealand lost the shootout 6-5 , leaving them `` bitterly disappointed '' .
It had gone the way of the spot-kickers through to 5-5 until New Zealand 's Anna Green missed . Iceland then scored to win and take third place .

The Football Ferns were using the well-respected tournament as a key component in their buildup towards the Rio Olympics .
New Zealand , ranked No 16 in the world , fell behind in the 27th minute when Andrea Ran Hanksdottir found the back of the net for 19th-ranked Iceland .
The Football Ferns worked long and hard in their search for an equaliser and it eventually came in the 71st minute through a strong strike from Amber Hearn whose shot went across the reach of the keeper .
The Football Ferns also had a strong claim for penalty waved away in the second half after a heavy challenge on Betsy Hassett in the Iceland area while several free kick opportunities came and went in the dying stages as the New Zealand side pressed for the winner .
Hearn , Rosie White , Rebekah Stott , Ria Percival , and Betsy Hassett were all successful with their penalty kicks in the shootout .
New Zealand coach Tony Readings felt their team found a higher level after a mixed first half performance but that still was n't enough .
`` We did n't play as well in the first half as we would have liked . We were a bit under par but were still the better team but we were n't as dominant as we should have been , '' Readings said .
`` We 've gone in 1-0 down but we knew we had an extra two or three gears to go up and we 'd be able to claw our way back in the second half which we did .
`` We 're bitterly disappointed because we dominated that second half , they 've hardly got in our half .
`` We scored a great goal and then we had a definite penalty turned down , we missed one-on-ones and we 've had lots of crosses and set plays and we 've not been able to get the breakthrough . That 's been the story of the tournament for us . ''
Readings again underlined the need for the team to find a sharper cutting edge in and around the opposition penalty area with the Olympics looming .
`` That inability to make that dominance count is still holding us back . There are some signs of improvement but we need more .
`` By the Olympics we need to be a better team in that part of the game because we did so well in so many parts but the part that makes the biggest difference is putting the ball in the net and that 's something we 've got to be better at . ''
In the other Algarve Cup playoffs Belgium beat Russia 5-0 for fifth place and Denmark downed Portugal 3-1 for seventh place .
Canada beat Brazil 2-1 in the final to take the title .
Duke tight end Davis Koppenhaver got an earlier start on their college football career than they may have expected three years ago when injuries to upperclassmen Braxton Deaver , Dan Beilinson and Erich Schneider forced them in to the rotation as a first-year student . Last season , with Deaver and Schneider back healthy , Koppenhaver took the unusual route of redshirting their second year . Many thought it was due to a lack of available playing time , but Koppenhaver shared the true reason on their Instagram account over the weekend .
`` This is a picture of me exactly one year ago , '' Koppenhaver 's post begins . `` I was 192 pounds while recovering from back to back surgeries on my shoulder and tonsils plus a surprise recurrence of a cancer I first had when I was 10 . ''
The emergence of their throat cancer when they were ten years old was caught just in time , literally , as they told The Daily Orange two years ago .
“ They said that if they had found it two weeks later , I probably would have died in my sleep , ” Koppenhaver said .
A dual-sport athlete in high school , Koppenhaver and their family still found time in their busy schedules to volunteer for the American Cancer Society ( Davis ' dad , Dave , also beat cancer ) .
Now , after shoulder surgery a year ago ( his second time undergoing surgery on their shoulders ) , a second defeat of cancer and a weight gain of 40+ pounds in a year 's time , Koppenhaver will return to the field for their redshirt sophomore season this fall .

The Cape Town Central City Improvement District noted Media24 's revamped building , adding value to the CBD property value .
PRESS STATEMENT BY MEDIA24 :
The South Gauteng High Court on 5 May 2016 issued its ruling in respect of the application brought by Moneyweb against Fin24 ( part of News24 ) for copyright infringement and unlawful competition . Moneyweb sued Fin24 in 2013 based on seven articles , published over a year ago , that included news elements derived , with attribution , from Moneyweb .
BREAKING STORY : Court finds Fin24 not guilty of copyright infringement , bar one article
“ The ruling vindicates our conviction that our conduct was fair and lawful , ” says Media24 chief executive Esmaré Weideman . “ The fact that the court ordered Moneyweb to pay 70 % of Media24 's cost speaks for itself . ”
Discovery and reporting do not move public domain news elements into a monopolised private domain and to suggest otherwise , as Moneyweb did , would be contrary to the public interest in news dissemination , they added .
“ It would lead to the illogical result where the first reporter can monopolise a news story and prevent another reporter from re-reporting the story 's core elements . Clearly this can not be , and a contrary position would have been a global-first and would have destroyed much of news reporting and many of today 's journalists ' jobs . ”
This is a landmark judgment for online publishing which is a fast-moving dynamic environment that is causing major disruption in publishing across the board . Since the application was brought the business model for online publishing has rapidly evolved to such an extent that Media24 's online publishing businesses have undergone dramatic change .
Weideman said the company took note of the court 's ruling that Fin24 had infringed copyright in one article . “ We accept the court 's decision and pride ourselves on ethical journalistic practice . Overall this ruling is a huge victory for Fin24 . It proves that aggregation and original reporting both have a place in modern journalism . ”
“ Significant investment was made to bolster News24 's original content and journalism , ” says Adriaan Basson , newly appointed editor of News24 which includes the syndication service News24Wire , Fin24 and Sport24 .
“ The appointment of a 16-strong national team of journalists and multimedia content producers , in addition to the more than 60 strong editorial teams we already had in our Cape Town and Johannesburg offices , strengthens our ability to deliver original content , breaking news and analysis to our readers fast , and wherever they are .
`` Now , more than ever , innovation is key to succeed in digital publishing . We keep a constant eye on international best practice and fair dealing which includes aggregation , an integral component of online publishing the world over , and have ensured that it is harmonised with the law . ”
Weideman says that Media24 is an innovative , forward-looking company , focused on remaining at the forefront of cutting-edge publishing models . “ We constantly evaluate our operations to strengthen the advantage we have built in the online news space over the past 18 years . We are happy that this ruling has brought closure to this dispute . ”
Full judgment :
Credibility . What does it really mean ?
National security leaders have thrown about the c-word quite a bit lately , most prominently with the Syria debate , but also in reference to the government shutdown . Credibility and deterrence have always been a factor in diplomacy and war . How else to get another actor to bend to your will or follow your lead if your threats and rewards are not believable ? Credibility , as a centerpiece of deterrence theory , took on a heightened importance for U.S. foreign policy over the course of the Cold War and the nuclear standoff . For those hoping to prevent unthinkable events , such as the use of weapons of mass destruction or catastrophic terrorist attacks , the idea of credibility has easily transitioned into the post-Cold War landscape . It is time today to consider credibility more broadly and look for some implications that have been missed .
By definition , credibility has always been integral to maintaining a position of leadership , as well as to deterring adversaries . During the Cold War , however , credibility and deterrence took on a greatly heightened importance . Deterrence became an end unto itself , due to the terrible possibility of absolute annihilation in nuclear war . Theorist Bernard Brodie wrote in their 1958 RAND Memo , “ The Anatomy of Deterrence ” that “ we look upon deterrence of total war today as something that must go permanently unchallenged . There is also presumptive evidence that a deterrence strategy diverges significantly from a strategy which emphasizes ability to win if war comes . ”
Brodie continued :
[ D ] eterrence philosophies and win-the-war philosophies may diverge in important respects . We can say in advance that they are likely to diverge in terms of priority.… The objective of erecting a high degree of deterrence takes a higher priority than the objective of assuring ourselves of a winning capability , if for no other reason than that the first is likely to be prerequisite to the second anyway , and is likely to cost less .
Despite Brodie 's warning , the United States learned about this divergence the hard way as the Kennedy Administration 's approach to deterrence , known as flexible response , came up against the test case of Vietnam . There , as Brodie had foreseen , the conflict itself was not as important as the demonstration of American resolve – specifically , resolve against the creeping menace of Communism and resolve to stand by America 's allies . In a word , it was a question of credibility . Failure to be credible in Vietnam , it was reasoned , could lead to a whole line of dominoes falling , as President Eisenhower warned in 1954 : after Vietnam would go Cambodia , Burma , Thailand , the Korean Peninsula , Indonesia , and then Japan , Taiwan , the Philippines , and even Australia and New Zealand . Robbed of its trading partners , Japan would have no choice but to turn toward the communist hordes .
“ So , ” Eisenhower concluded , “ the possible consequences of the loss are just incalculable to the free world. ” In Vietnam , an initial commitment of advisors to signal resolve and credibility was taken without consideration of how to ultimately win the war , setting the stage for a series of escalations , each based on the failure of the previous half-measure . Incredibly , National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy gave the chances of winning the war at as little as 25 percent , while still maintaining that “ even if it fails , the policy will be worth it. ” The larger standoff with the Soviet Union was the overriding concern , but the path America chose—which led to strategic defeat and the deaths of over 58,000 Americans—and the unforgettably searing images of defeat can hardly have enhanced American credibility .
When credibility becomes a logic unto itself for using military force , it crowds out debate on more concrete aims and whether or not the campaign is likely to achieve them . And if the aim of a campaign is to uphold credibility , then anything short of absolute victory and unconditional capitulation is a self-defined failure . Yet , these sorts of victories can be elusive when a power is unable or unwilling to deploy overwhelming and ruthless military power in ways that are now commonly viewed as amoral and illegal , even in the context of war .
As deterrence theorist Thomas Schelling stated , “ With enough military force a country may not need to bargain. ” The United States has shown a disinclination to bargain , but it also hesitates to use maximal military force . When policymakers look at force as a marker of credibility and see their clashes as bipolar struggles between good and evil , they do not see bargaining as a legitimate course of action . When they forego bargaining , war becomes a futile act of vengeance .
For Schelling ( like Clausewitz ) violence and diplomacy had to be linked to have purpose :
To inflict suffering gains nothing and saves nothing directly ; it can only make people behave to avoid it . The only purpose , unless sport or revenge , must be to influence somebody 's behavior , to coerce their decision or choice . To be coercive , violence has to be anticipated . And it has to be avoidable by accommodation . The power to hurt is bargaining power . To exploit it is diplomacy .
America is willing to use force to defend its credibility , or , as we saw in the case of Syria , the credibility of certain international norms . In other words , it is willing to hurt for deterrent effect . Today 's landscape is far different from that of the Cold War , yet American views of the world continue to favor a bipolarity of good versus evil . While these are simple and satisfying concepts , they harden minds and encourage leadership-by-intimidation rather than leadership-by-example .
Yet , even during the Cold War , American leadership was predicated on much more than the credible threat of military force . Military dominance played a huge role in the postwar Pax Americana , like the Pax Romana and Pax Britannia before it . But there was far more . Each of these powers provided order to political , commercial , and social life across great swathes of the globe . While the United States did not seek to build its own empire , it did help to rebuild postwar Europe and Japan and lead the way to a prosperous network of global trade . That role has diminished , leaving U.S. foreign policy increasingly militarized—all sticks and few carrots .
The U.S. would do well to reduce its preoccupation with the credibility of its deterrent stick and to focus more on its credibility as a functioning political system capable of providing order to the world 's political and commercial life . When the U.S. does feel compelled to exercise its military credibility , it needs to pay close attention to the fact that unless violence is used to compel some diplomatic behavior , it is nothing more than sport or revenge .

A painting by Jam Tolles reminds me of “ Las Meninas , ” the enigmatic 1656 painting by Diego Velázquez , even though visually the two have little in common .
Velázquez 's oil masterpiece depicts members of the Spanish Court in a grand drawing room with a mirror , the figures peering back at you as if you were some sort of peculiar guest popping in .
Tolles filled ketchup bottles with acrylic paint and gooped hundreds of flowers on reflective mylar panels , creating amorphous mirrored pools that reflect the viewer between the blooms .
What the two pieces share is this : They both implicate the viewer , tangling what it means to observe and to be observed , disrupting perceptions .
“ For me , it was a way to picture myself in a feminine identity , ” Tolles says . “ The first girl clothes I ever owned were from my girlfriend in undergrad. ” They gave Tolles floral leggings .
This piece is “ Calico ( My First Girl Clothes ) , ” consisting of four large panels . Two panels will be on display at the Eugene-Springfield Pride Festival Aug. 13 , as well at a show of Tolles ' new work , Grape Jelly , opening Aug. 12 at WOW Hall .
This spring Tolles completed an MFA at the University of Oregon School of Architecture and Allied Arts , where they honed skills in multimedia painting and performance art that explored the fluidity of gender identity and sexuality in contemporary culture .
They are also a founding member of the puckish contemporary art collective Tropical Contemporary .
“ I 've only identified as transgender in the last year or two , ” Tolles says . “ With my art , I think it was really important because I could explore things conceptually with painting and colors , and maybe that was a coping mechanism too . I was afraid socially to wear a dress outside , but I could paint a dress . ”
Upon graduation , Tolles recalls their professors asking her , as an artist and a trans woman , , “ Why are n't you in New York , L.A. , Berlin ? ”
“ This is probably the best place I can imagine , ” they say of Eugene while sitting at a sidewalk table at The Wayward Lamb pub and nightclub , a place they describe as an anchor for the local queer community . Tolles also points to Trans * ponder , the transgender resource and support nonprofit , as vital . They say in a larger city , these resources and people would be more geographically spread out .
‘ DoughnutDNA ( out to play ) Elmo & Big Bird ( Chaos & Harmony ) death waits another day ' and two panels of ‘ Calico ( my first girl clothes ) '
“ Getting out of grad school was kind of the first time in a long time where I was like : I 'm free , ” Tolles says . “ I 've just found a group of people here organically that are queer and supportive and reinforcing of what I am . ”
That 's not to say this transition has always been smooth sailing .
“ It 's a push and pull — making one step forward in your life and then experiencing the social repercussions , ” they say , adding : “ But still , being out is being visible and being vulnerable and being targetable . ”
Despite the risks , Tolles says they feel more comfortable with herself , and their lifelong struggle with depression and anxiety seems to be waning .
When the mass shooting happened at Pulse nightclub June 12 in Orlando , Tolles was working on another painting — “ DoughnutDNA ( Out to Play ) Elmo & Big Bird ( Chaos and Harmony ) Death Waits Another Day. ” The piece , featuring Big Bird 's midsection , a pile of Elmo heads and floating doughnuts , morphed into a meditation on the loss of innocence . A green helicopter hovers ominously in the background as a reminder .

The polarized state of U.S. politics is an ongoing obsession of mine , particularly the state of the conservative movement and its implications for the climate change fight . Long story short , I argue that the contemporary U.S. right is too far gone to reach on climate change .
A few posts on the subject :
A couple of pieces have appeared on other sites recently that push back against my conclusion . They provide a good opportunity to clarify and reinforce a few things .
Over at Science of Us , Jesse Singal writes about new psychological research on how to appeal to conservatives on climate change . And on Huffington Post , Bill Becker — head of the Presidential Climate Action Project — argues that it 's still possible to find common ground on the issue .
Lab v. world
Singal says that reaching conservatives “ has more to do with psychology than politics. ” And Becker turns to poll results to bolster their case . In both cases , I am skeptical .
How much do polls and message testing tell us about people 's behavior in real-world politics ? Over the years , my answer on this has drifted from lots to little to almost nothing . In fact , over-interpreted results from polling and message testing can mislead us about politics .
For example : Becker cites the fact that party identification is on the decline . More and more people are identifying themselves as “ independent , ” mainly because they are disgusted by Congress and politics generally . Many people take this to mean that voters are rejecting extremes , moving to the middle , up for grabs , open to fresh ideas . But as political scientists will tell you , independents are almost always undercover partisans ; they overwhelmingly vote with one party . True swing voters have been , and still are , on the decline . Party identification may be on the wane , but polarization is proceeding as fast as ever .
Similarly , Becker cites a whole raft of polls ( many of which I 've cited myself ! ) showing majorities of Americans in favor of action on climate change , clean air regulations , energy efficiency , and clean energy . Polls show striking unity on these subjects , at least relative to more divisive issues like taxes or defense . But the fact that those polls rarely translate into political unity , to action , ought to give us pause .
Put a conservative in a room with a poll and ask them whether they support cleaner air . Why of course they do ! More efficient energy use ? Sure ! More solar energy ? Yes , please ! People like cleaner , more , and better , generally speaking .
Now imagine that conservative in their living room , watching Fox or listening to talk radio . Are they hearing about cleaner air ? No , he 's hearing about job-killing regulations , which they hate . Are they hearing about efficiency savings ? No , he 's hearing about Big Government coming to take their lightbulbs , and they hate that . Are they hearing about the recent flourishing of solar power ? No , he 's hearing about Solyndra , about government boondoggles and giveaways . They hate those .
The same is true of psychological experiments . Isolating a person in a lab and testing their response to a message delivered in isolation will tell you something . But it wo n't tell you much about how the same person will respond in a blooming , buzzing real-world context , surrounded by an ideologically supportive set of peers and influencers , exposed to multiple media streams intent on delivering opposing messages .
Singal knows all this , of course . “ It 's not as though shifts in framing can undo decades of culture-war battles , ” they admit . The fact is , in politics , finding a message that appeals is only the first step , and a small one . What makes a message stick is not its inherent appeal but its delivery . We trust messages from peers and leaders in our tribe and messages that fit comfortably within our worldview . And we remember messages that are frequently repeated . What the right has achieved , partly through polarization itself and partly through organized effort , is a situation in which most conservatives are mostly surrounded by other conservatives and are exposed mostly to conservative media .
Epistemic closure means that signals from outside have a hard time getting in . Clever messages that work on polls and in labs will only do their work if they can penetrate the bubble . Until you solve that dilemma , you ca n't say you 've found a way to appeal to conservatives , not in the real world , anyway .
Climate change is not endlessly malleable
People who devote their time and attention to communications tend have great faith in its power . They believe climate change can be communicated to anyone , if you just proceed from the right values and frames . I think this is wrong , that climate change , by its nature , is hostile to some values and amenable to others ( a point Naomi Klein makes powerfully in their new book ) .
Let 's take Singal 's main example of how conservative and liberal psychologies differ : Conservatives are more likely than liberals to respond to threats with what 's called system justification .
Put simply , system justification arises from the deep-seated psychological need for humans to feel like the broad systems they are a part of are working correctly . … People tend to deal with major threats to their systems in one of two ways : taking a threat so seriously that they seek out ways to neutralize it , or “ finding ways to justify away problems in order to maintain the sense of legitimacy and well-being of the system , ” explained Irina Feygina , a social psychologist at New York University . This latter route is system justification .
Conservatives ' propensity to system justification is tied up with the rest of the conservative psychological profile — the greater value they place on hierarchy , in-group membership , and familiarity ( liberals rate higher on openness to new experience ) .
So how would one craft a climate message to appeal to those prone to system justification ?
“ What you need to do is put the system first , ” said Feygina . “ Instead of saying , ‘ Let 's deal with climate change , let 's be pro-environmental , let 's protect the oceans , ' what you need to do is come in and say , ‘ If we want to preserve our system , if we want to be patriotic , if we want our children to have the life that we have , then we have to take these actions that allow us to maintain those things that we care about . ' ” The starting point ca n't be about averting catastrophe , in other words — it has to be about pride in the current system and the need to maintain it .
I agree : That message , if used deftly , would avoid triggering system justification . Problem is , it would also be deeply misleading .

The current system is not going to survive . There is simply no prospect of it , no honest promise that can be made . We may take no strong action to reduce emissions . But if so , in 20 or 30 years we will be experiencing regular upheavals that will leave no country or people unscathed . Or we may do in earnest what we all claim to agree is necessary , putting ourselves on a course to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees C or less . But if we do that , it will involve something like wartime mobilization , a radical reshaping of economic and political power dynamics . Either way , or whatever mix of the two , the current energy-profligate , hyperconsumerist , hyperwasteful , cheap-global-trading , happy-motoring suburban dream is over . Conservatives will have to wake up like everybody else .
Dealing with climate change will also involve big government . It will involve international cooperation , maybe even muscular international governance . It will involve redistribution of wealth to address historic responsibility , long-term planning , and large-scale public investment ( with concomitant higher taxes ) . All of that is going to trample on the rigid , narrow set of catechisms that define today 's conservative movement .
There 's a message on climate change that appeals to conservatives : We can confine ourselves to market mechanisms , we do n't need to raise taxes or regulate anything or redistribute any wealth , we can all make money . If we act on climate change , the socioeconomic and cultural systems you know can be preserved . There 's a message that works , but it is a lie .
Rather than climate hawks twisting themselves in knots trying package things in the least threatening way for conservatives , perhaps it is conservatives who ought to change , to open their eyes , to let go of a world they think they 're defending but which is , in reality , already gone .
If you are a renter like me , you are unlikely to be lugging around an authentic coat of arms or a suit of armor as heirloom art . What if you want to decorate your home in a lightweight , funkier way than the usual wall art ? After visiting museums this week with Afghan-Italian embroidery , European silver , and African barkcloth , I have some fresh ideas to share for home decor art .
Here are my 5 Uncommon Tips for Displaying Art at Home :
1 . Consider carvings . Home accessories such as carved wood and soapstone can be so much more than knick knacks . Select items that have meaning to you . Like me you are not likely to purchase an 18th-century carved Italian door even at architectural salvage , but you might be interested in buying a carved panel from a contemporary local artist . For example , I 've seen many sculptures by Venice Beach artists that would make great conversational art pieces for the home .
2 . Navigate a non-Western culture . Paul Gaugin and Vincent Van Gogh were studio-mates for a time . Did you know they shared a love for Japanese woodblock prints ? Yes , it 's true . Consider fan art by the two . My favorite is Gaugin 's Design for a Fan : Breton Shepherd Boy ( 1888 ) on silk .
In this case , fan art refers to an actual fan rather than a sentient admirer . This means Western scenes painted to fit the shape of an Eastern-style fan . You can also learn about African headdresses and South American drinking vessels . None of these art pieces you choose for your home need to be expensive . Find inexpensive copies and miniatures of displays that you love . Research the religious or symbolic meaning of such art because displaying in your apartment to avoid offending visitors .
3 . Treat yourself to texture . Handwoven paper , pressed pulp , and upcycled cloth can be lovely for framing . Why not showcase white on white texture ? Why not hang embroidered veils , lace shawls or vibrant traditional costumes on a wooden dowel ? If you have any doubt about what the fingers can “ see ” , check out painter Carvaggio 's attention to the hands of their subjects .
Though jacquard and chintz are feminine , you have many manly options as well . You can even consider framing a piece of tweed for a man cave . French nails used for monograms are another masculine example .
House Beautiful 1000 Sensational Makeovers suggests textures such as rich leather and relief wall sculpture . Treat your home art in the way museums display artifacts . For an example , see the Central African barkcloth display at the UCLA Fowler Museum . My favorite pattern there is the “ frog-hip ” tattoo pattern on barkcloth . Discover inexpensive alternatives such as traditional patterns in fabrics and throw blankets as art for your home .
4 . Target Tin . Decorative tin inserts for kitchen cabinet frames add funkiness at a low cost . If you want to spend more , embossed tin ceilings provide art for home decor with a vintage flair .
5 . Nurture Nature . The Wall Street Journal featured “ living walls ” earlier this summer . These are modular , stackable living plants that decorate your interior . If such an interior garden will make you sneeze , you can even fool the eye with pollen-free , artificial flowering branches placed in a dust-free , faux plaster urn .
Edward Snowden , the former National Security Agency ( NSA ) contractor who is currently in exile in Russia for leaking classified information , has endorsed the relaunch of Lavabit , an encryption email service company that chose to shut down instead of complying with the order of authorities which Lavabit believed could compromise the private data of its users , a report said Friday .
Lavabit had 410,000 accounts in September 2013 , when it shut down after being confronted by federal law authorities in pursuit of Snowden . Although the authorities claimed that they were after Snowden 's account , allowing them access to the service 's SSL encryption key could jeopardize the credentials for other users as well .
“ The SSL key was our biggest threat , ” Ladar Levison , the founder of Lavabit , explained to the Intercept , prior to the relaunch of the encryption service that has been modified with several privacy-enhancing features such as Dark Internet Mail Environment ( DIME ) standard that obscures the metadata on emails to prevent intelligence agencies from snooping on users ' emails .
Information present in the “ to , ” “ from , ” and “ subject ” lines sent out in emails can be used by law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies such as NSA and CIA to gather more information about the user through an analysis of the metadata . However , Dark Mail architecture modeled on Tor , the Onion Router , can obscure this process . Upon launch , new and old Lavabit users and customers will have three modes to choose from : Trustful , Cautious and Paranoid .
“ This is the first step in a very long journey . ... What we 're hoping for is that by the end of this year we 'll be more secure than any of the other encrypted messaging apps out there on the market , ” Levison added , while alluding to plans to roll out end-to-end encryption later this year .
They clarified that until the new end-to-end encryption is rolled out , the company has made temporary arrangements so that they will no longer be able to hand over the SSL key .
“ We have installed FIPS 140-2 hardware security modules which allows us to use a TLS key without having to access it directly . Any attempt to extract the key will trigger a tamper circuit causing the key to self-destruct . The only account capable of extracting the key is the HSM supervisor . To prevent this we set the passphrase blindly thus locking us out , ” the company explained .
Speaking to the Intercept , exiled whistleblower Snowden said that they plan on reactivating their Lavabit account after it relaunches , “ if only to show support for their courage. ” Snowden , however , did not comment on Lavabit 's modified security features .
Snowden said Lavabit appeals to them because it has “ a proven willingness to shut down the company rather than sell out their users , even if a court makes the wrong call . ... That 's actually a very big deal : They might be the only ones in the world that can claim that . ”
Snowden may not be entirely correct in this claim , though . Following the gag order on Lavabit , Silent Circle , another similar encrypted email , mobile video and voice service provider that was also served with government orders , permanently erased the encryption keys that allowed access to emails stored or transmitted by its service and shut down its encrypted email services .
Why is Afghanistan hooked on poppies ?
Richard Holbrooke announced in Rome on Saturday that the U.S. will shift anti-poppy efforts in Afghanistan away from destroying crops and toward supporting alternatives . How easy is it to grow poppy ?
Quite . Poppy seeds are tiny , hardy , and inexpensive . Soil preparation is minimal , and little fertilizer is required . The seeds can simply be scattered on the field rather than drilled into the ground . ( Sowing most grains with this technique will result in a patchy and unproductive field . ) Although poppy requires a fair amount of water , alternative crops—like wheat—will die much more quickly in times of drought .
The problem with poppy comes at harvest . Most farm work is still done by hand in Afghanistan , and harvesting anything is difficult . Take wheat , for example . Lacking a gas-powered combine , farmers reap the old-fashioned way—by swinging a scythe or an even less efficient sickle . ( Most communities or extended families do share a mechanized thresher—a not-insignificant capital expense—to separate the wheat from the chaff . ) But poppy is more costly by at least an order of magnitude . Workers slice into the pod , permitting the crude opium sap to ooze out and dry on the shell . They return later in the day to scrape the sap , then scrape once or twice more the next day . Because individual farmers can not complete the process for even a small field before most of the pods die , they have to hire an army of migrant laborers from throughout South Asia . More than 350,000 workers are required for the Helmand Province harvest alone . Because the harvest is limited to about a six-week window , labor is expensive . The process is also dangerous . Most harvesters , many of them children , develop opium addictions or serious health problems by absorbing the sap through their skin . ( Some farmers can tell when it 's time to harvest poppy because they wake up with headaches and nausea from the fumes . )
At about $ 2,000 per acre , no annual crop can match poppy in terms of gross revenue . ( This is an average—prices are higher for farmers closer to the Pakistan border and thus the international market . ) Even at the historically high prices of 2008 , wheat did n't clear one-fifth of that . This is a staggering sum for Afghan farmers , most of whom work small farms of less than two jiribs ( that 's about one acre ) . But due to the labor investment , the actual profit on one acre of poppy ( about $ 850 ) , while still higher than wheat ( $ 200 ) , is far less than for other traditional Afghan crops like grapes ( $ 1,000 ) , pomegranates ( $ 5,000 ) , and almonds ( $ 6,000 ) . Unfortunately , without international aid—which is difficult to deliver in Taliban-infested regions like Helmand—most Afghan farmers ca n't afford to wait the few years it takes to get a fruit or nut orchard up and running .

The white strip in the national flag remains constant but it is no longer an acknowledgement of the presence of non-Muslims in Pakistan . Shrinking numbers . Shrinking space . Shrinking visibility . And , above all , shrinking rights . This , in a nutshell , is the status of religious minorities in Pakistan .
At the time of Independence , Pakistan 's religious minority constituted over 20 per cent of the population . Even allowing for the separation of East Pakistan in 1971 , where most of the Hindus were settled , the decrease in numbers is alarming . The 1998 census reported the decline to be a little over 3 per cent . While the recent census data has not yet been made public , it is expected that the proportion of religious minorities will show a further decline . It should be noted that official figures have been disputed by members of minority communities , who believe they are deliberately under-counted during census .
Migration is believed to be the major reason for the diminishing numbers . However , behind this exodus lies a narrative of persecution and discrimination . Liberals and minority groups continue to cling to the Quaid-i-Azam 's address to the country 's first Constituent Assembly on August 11 , 1947 , where they assured non-Muslims of freedom of worship in the new state of Pakistan , a state whose business would have nothing to do with religion .
The shift towards an exclusive Islamic identity began soon after Independence . The Islamic nature of the state was determined by the Objectives Resolution , a preamble to the Constitution of 1956 . Again , in another of history 's ironies , when a Hindu member of parliament from East Pakistan expressed their reservations on the Objectives Resolution , it was Zafarullah Khan , an Ahmadi , who rose to defend it . Little did they realise that , decades later , the professed Islamic identity for the state of Pakistan would ultimately lead to their own community being declared non-Muslims through a constitutional amendment in 1974 .
The religious parties , led by the Jamaat-e-Islami , began to demand the imposition of Sharia as a logical development for a state that had come into being on the basis of Islam . The other demand , suppressed at the time , was to declare Ahmadis ‘ non-Muslims ' . It is important to note that while the government of the day cracked down heavily on the Jamaat-e-Islami , imposing curfew in Lahore , and passing the death sentence on its leader , Maulana Maudoodi , today the persecution of Ahmadis goes unchecked and ostensibly has the support of the administration .
From targeting their congregations to attacking their graveyards , the Ahmadis have seen the worst face of intolerance in Pakistan . Among the most serious attacks was in May 2010 , when Ahmadi mosques in Garhi Shahu and in Model Town , Lahore , were targeted killing 86 people and injuring over 120 . In another condemnable incident , over 100 Ahmadi graves were desecrated in Lahore in December 2012 . In July 2015 , four members of the Ahmadi community were killed in Gujranwala when their home was attacked by a mob on the pretext of a member having committed blasphemy .
While all rulers of Pakistan played the religion card for purposes of expediency , it was General Zia-ul-Haq who institutionalised discrimination and opened the doors to persecution of non-Muslims . Apart from making amendments to ensure severe punishment for Ahmadis calling themselves Muslims , the additions and amendments they introduced to laws pertaining to blasphemy suddenly led to a sharp spike in alleged incidents of blasphemy , both in the number of cases registered and vigilante justice . It should be noted that while no one ( in spite of the death penalty ) has been executed after being convicted of blasphemy , over 65 people have been killed — either by enraged mobs or individuals ( including police officers ) in prisons .
The first case to come to public attention was that of Naimat Ahmar in 1992 , a 45-year-old Christian school teacher in Faisalabad who was stabbed to death by a student . According to subsequent reports , they were targeted for refusing to be transferred to another town ; their position in the government school was desired by a Muslim teacher . Following wall chalking accusing Ahmar of blasphemy , a 20-year-old student , Farooq , killed him .
Since then the toll has risen . Manzoor Masih , accused of blasphemy , was killed at a bus stop in Lahore in April 1994 . Samuel Masih was killed by a police officer assigned to guard them in hospital in 2003 . In April 2008 , a factory worker in Karachi , Jagdish Kumar , was lynched to death by fellow workers . For the record , many Muslims have also been subjected to mob justice , including Mashal Khan , a Mardan student in April this year .
Shantinagar in 1997 , Gojra in 2009 , and Joseph Colony ( Lahore ) and Francis Colony ( Gujranwala ) in 2013 are examples where crowds have been instigated to attack entire neighbourhoods of Christians allegedly by property grabbers . In all these cases , no one was convicted . The course of ‘ justice ' in each case reveals the painful reality that non-Muslims can not place hope in either the administrative or legal system . In the case of Joseph Colony , those arrested for destroying over 160 Christian homes were quickly released on bail with no further progress reported on their trial . The sole Christian charged , Sawan Masih , whose alleged blasphemy had been used to instigate mobs , was given the death sentence in a rare display of speedy justice .
Another horrific incident took place on November 4 , 2014 , when a young couple , Shama and Sajjad , were lynched by a mob in Kot Radha Krishan , Punjab . They were beaten to death and then burned by an angry mob that heard announcements from mosques that they had desecrated a copy of the Holy Quran . They were working as bonded labourers at a brick kiln and this is where they met their violent death .
Asia Bibi , a Christian woman , was convicted for making blasphemous remarks over seven years ago . Them death sentence was upheld by the Lahore High Court . They filed an appeal in the Supreme Court ; however , when their case finally came up for hearing , a judge recused themselves and the case was adjourned indefinitely .
Hindus , concentrated mostly in Sindh , carry the burden of historical prejudice as well as association with India . According to their representatives , the greatest issue of concern to the community is that of forced conversions , the majority of these being young women . In most cases the girls , many of whom are minors , are abducted , forcibly converted to Islam and then married to Muslim men . The Sindh Assembly 's bill to check forced conversions , passed last year , was put on the back-burner after protests by religious parties . Several politico-religious figures in Sindh have taken it upon themselves to convert Hindus and , though one leader openly bragged in parliament about their conversion activities , no action was taken against him .
Recently , the Indian government has announced its willingness to accept those suffering from religious persecution in neighbouring countries . The migration of Hindus to India may soon turn into an exodus if they continue to be treated as unequal citizens .
The Sikhs have been somewhat better treated by official quarters — perhaps to demonstrate to India that Pakistan is willing to embrace a religious minority that has not been treated too well across the border .
A few years ago , the Supreme Court directed the government to take steps to ensure the rights of minorities and protection of their places of worship . Apart from tokenism such as the Prime Minister celebrating Diwali with the Hindu community , the minorities have seen little serious commitment from the government .

CBS `` Evening News '' Report : Is ObamaCare Bad For Business ?
( CBS News ) NEW YORK CITY - Most parts of Obamacare will take effect next year , but a lot of small businesses are already making plans .
At the Five Guys restaurant in New York City , burgers and fries are the specialties , but owner John Rigos worries he 'll have to cook up some cost savings when the affordable care act is fully implemented .
`` It 'll likely affect the number of people we can hire , '' Rigos said .
Rigos , who has 10 New York franchises and 250 employees , was waiting until after the election to confront the new health care legislation -- officially called the Affordable Care Act -- which will force them to provide insurance for all their full time workers , or face hefty fines .
`` It 'll probably have to reduce the staff to some degree , and again , focus on building smaller stronger team rather than being as aggressive in opening up new stores and creating new jobs , '' Rigos said .
The Senate is set Wednesday to override President Obama 's veto of a bill allowing the victims of terrorism to sue foreign countries , an embarrassing foreign policy setback months before they leave office .
Congressional sources on both sides of the Capitol say the White House 's lobbying effort to sustain Obama 's veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act has been muted , and they expect the override to pass overwhelmingly .

It would be the first override of Obama 's presidency , and one of the biggest legislative wins of the Republican-controlled Congress over Obama .
Yet Republicans , who have been eager to tout their accomplishments this year , do n't plan on spiking the football , perhaps because the override is also a big win for Democrats such as New York Sen.

The legislation allows foreign sponsors of terrorism to be sued in U.S. courts and is strongly supported by the families of Sept. 11 victims . The legislation is aimed at facilitating lawsuits against Saudi Arabia , the country where most of the 9/11 hijackers came from .
The bill passed the Senate and the House unanimously earlier this year and last week received backing from both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders : ' I fully expect ' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed ' 2016 primary Sanders : 'Damn right ' I 'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes ' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson : Clinton staff are 'biggest a -- holes in American politics ' MORE and Republican nominee Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe : report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort 's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE .
Overturning the veto requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers , and Corker said the override would be “ a fait accompli ” if senators voted on the politically charged issue before the elections .
“ Unless there are 34 people willing to fall on their swords over this , it 's probably not worth falling on your sword over , ” they told The Washington Post .
Graham , who said earlier this month that they did not believe the Saudi government was to blame for the Sept. 11 attacks and scrambled with Corker to make changes to the legislation , says they will probably join their colleagues in voting for the override .
“ If nobody 's trying to accommodate this problem , we 're just gon na vote … and if I have to vote , I 'm going to vote to override the veto , ” Graham told The Post and Courier of Charleston , S.C .
A Senate aide said the White House waited too long to try to kill the bill , which passed the Senate by unanimous voice vote in May .
“ It is a political malpractice that the full press is coming so late , ” said the aide .
Another Senate aide said the White House appears to realize that not much can be done at this point .
“ It does n't seem to me that they 're really trying that hard , ” the aide said . “ The White House is kind of out of options . ”
In their veto message to the Senate , Obama warned the legislation would undermine U.S. security by letting private litigants and the courts decide whether foreign governments have sponsored terrorism — a task currently left to national security and foreign policy professionals .
Obama noted the United States has a larger international presence than any other country and argued that creating an exception to sovereign immunity would subject U.S. military and other government personnel to foreign court proceedings .
White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Monday declined to describe the president 's lobbying effort in detail but said their team has contacted various lawmakers .
“ The president 's views are well known , ” they told reporters . “ The president 's had an opportunity to convey those to members of Congress at different points . ”

Cardin said they would carefully review Obama 's veto statement before deciding how they would vote on the override , so Kerry will have ample opportunity to make the administration 's case .
Senate aides say the bill 's sponsors made a significant concession to the administration earlier this year when they included language allowing future presidents to halt a lawsuit against a foreign government through a court-mediated process .

“ I do have concerns about the legislation , ” Ryan said , noting that as Speaker , they usually do not vote . “ But I 'm going to let Congress work its will , because that 's what Congress does . I do think the votes are there for the override . ”
Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( Calif. ) , the second-highest-ranking House GOP leader , said they also believe it will pass .

McCarthy said he 's “ inclined ” to vote to override the veto but will meet with Thornberry before making a final decision .
Thornberry circulated a letter to all of their Republican colleagues Friday warning the legislation would put U.S. military and intelligence personnel at risk .
They argued that if other countries were to take similar measures , “ the risks of discovery or trial in foreign courts , including the questioning of government employees under oath , will disclose sensitive information and subject Americans to legal jeopardy . ”
Smith made similar points in a letter circulated among members of their caucus .
“ We must protect the people we rely on to carry out U.S. policy , and these legal safeguards are essential in doing so , ” they wrote in a letter dated Sunday .

Saun & Starr ( that 's Saun like `` sawn , '' short for Saundra ) are dissing some classless loudmouth loser in this awesome soul funk banger , “ Big Wheel. ” The track is a throwback to classic 70s soul and funk , fitting perfectly in that Daptone wheelhouse , and the low-key video directed by Wayne Gordon , set in an amusement park , perfectly matches the music 's vibe , as they urge the chump to “ roll on ” out of their lives . The duo , who are both from the Bronx and met at an open mic night in Harlem in the 80s , is the longtime backing singers for Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings ( their first gig with Jones was when the three were in a New York area wedding band in the 90s ) . “ Big Wheel ” is from their debut LP Look Closer , to be released May 19 on Daptone Records ( order yours ) .
KINSHASA ( Reuters ) - Police fired tear gas to disperse supporters of Democratic Republic of Congo 's opposition chief on Sunday as they gathered in the capital amid high tensions over election delays keeping President Joseph Kabila in power , a Reuters witness said .
Felix Tshisekedi , head of an opposition coalition , is due to fly back to the capital Kinshasa on Sunday after a prolonged absence abroad . Around a dozen supporters had gathered at their family residences in the morning , although there was no sign of violence .
Tshisekedi intends to call for a civil disobedience campaign in order to pressure Kabila , whose mandate expired last year , to step aside .
Congolese authorities banned the coalition 's planned meeting on Sunday , citing a risk of violence in the Central African country of more than 70 million people .

Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz got the Federal Communications Commission 's seal of approval after they dropped an F-bomb in a pre-game speech that was broadcast on live television . Ortiz 's R-rated remarks were delivered on the field at Fenway Park before the first Red Sox home game since Monday 's bombing at the Boston Marathon .
“ This is our fucking city , ” Ortiz said . “ And nobody gon na dictate our freedom . Stay strong . Thank you . ”
The FCC regulates “ obscenity , indecency and profanity ” on radio and television and often issues fines for on-air swearing . However , FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski issued a statement of support for Ortiz on the agency 's official Twitter account after the game .
“ David Ortiz spoke from the heart at today 's Red Sox game . I stand with Big Papi and the people of Boston , ” Genachowski wrote .
Even if you 're not the church-going type , it 's likely that Randall Wallace 's Heaven Is For Real has made its way onto your radar by now . The film ( based on Rev . Todd Burpo 's succinctly-titled Heaven is for Real : A Little Boy 's Astounding Story of Their Trip to Heaven and Back ) has been in release for going on two weeks , a stretch of time during which the $ 12m film has managed to triple its budget . The film 's stunning success is just as believable as the story that inspired it .
For the uninitiated , Heaven Is For Real tells the ostensibly true story of Colton Burpo ( son of the book 's author , Rev . Todd , not to be confused with Rev . Run ) , who went into emergency surgery back in 2003 , only to be declared `` clinically dead '' before snapping out of it and claiming to have spent the interim in Heaven . Colton , then aged 4 , described meeting dead relatives ( including their miscarried sister ) as well as Jesus H. Christ , the latter of which was riding `` a rainbow-colored horse . ''
The real Colton Burpo would now be 14 years old ( Earth-time ) , so it 's entirely possible that he 'd set up a Twitter account for themselves in order to further spread their story and promote the film based on their experience . But the person behind the @ TheColtonBurpo Twitter account probably is n't that Colton Burpo . That Colton Burpo , though equally believable , is probably another kind of Colton Burpo altogether .
Things start out innocuously enough on April 19th . Young master Burpo arrives on Twitter and begins promoting the film .
But then ...
... slowly but surely ...
... things start to take a turn for the weird .
Between otherwise innocuous , totally believable tweets wishing followers a happy Easter and requests to see the film based on `` his '' experience , @ TheColtonBurpo begins threading a series of progressively troubling ( and hilarious ) non-sequiturs about their time served in Heaven . These range from the unfortunately phrased and somewhat off-putting ...
... to the hilariously untrue and potentially actionable ...
... to The Omen .
Whether or not you 'll want to follow @ TheColtonBurpo for further shenanigans will depend entirely upon how funny you think this is . If nothing else , I would strongly recommend heading over to `` Colton 's '' page to peruse their entire Tweet history ( as of this writing , it 's sitting around 75 posts ) . Here are a few more of my favorites , for the road :

Real Madrid 's James Rodríguez revealed near the end of the transfer window that they were the subject of an €85 million transfer offer , but they did n't reveal the name of the club . That club , sources say , was Inter Milan .
James did n't want to move to Inter because they did n't feel the club has a big enough stature these days . Still , Inter 's failed bid revealed a couple things : One , Inter 's ownership is capable of making an €85 million bid , which is a good sign for Inter fans . And two , James really does want to make a go of it at Real Madrid for now .
So far this season the 25-year-old James has been used by Zinedine Zidane as a substitute in the UEFA Super Cup and in two of Real Madrid 's league matches and they were available off the bench to begin the club 's Champions League title defense against Sporting Lisbon .
Here in the Pacific Northwest we know about volcanoes . Many people who live here remember the eruption of Mt . Saint Helens in 1980 . That is the last major eruption we 've had in the continental United States . Then we get reports of that same volcano showing eruption activity in 2004 and geologists say it 's the most likely volcano to erupt again in our lifetime . Plus , most of us in the Puget Sound area have a gorgeous view of Mt . Rainier , another threatening volcano . Then factor in the other two Washington volcanoes that are on the “ most likely to erupt ” list and we definitely have a reason to prepare .
Do n't think you 're safe from an eruption just because you do n't live in Washington . Alaska is full of volcanoes on the danger list as well as some from Oregon and California . Though the most concerning US volcanoes are located on the West Coast , there are a few others speckled across the country including the Yellowstone Caldera in Wyoming which is classified as a super volcano . In Colombia , Nevado del Huila which erupted in 2008 and Galeras which erupted in 1993 killing 9 people . There are volcanoes in Mexico , Iceland , Japan , Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo all showing signs of danger .
I believe in prepping for anything , but my current locale leads me to prioritize volcanic eruption high up on the list . The cloud of volcanic ash will affect every part of your life . Air and drinking water will all be contaminated with volcanic ash which contains pulverized rock and glass . Something you do n't want to be breathing or drinking . If you need to bug out , your vehicle is not going to run well when the intake is full of ash and your visibility could be near zero . If you live in an area in close enough proximity to a volcano , some extra measures in your preps could go a long way to keeping you safe during and after an eruption .
Air Quality :
Keep some extra dust masks or respirators for you and your family . If you go with a respirator , keep at least ten extra filters for each mask . If you use dust masks , keep at least ten for each member of your family or survival party . Respirators come in three levels : FFP1 , FFP2 and FFP3 . The higher the number , the more particulates it filters . Make sure the masks are of good quality and fit with a tight seal around the outside edges .
Water Quality :
The volcanic ash that falls from the sky as a result of an eruption can make water supplies unsafe to drink . It 's always best to have some sealed water to drink in case of emergency , but if your backup water plan is something like a rain barrel or a small stream , it is bound to become undrinkable . You can keep a pH meter or pH test strips in your emergency kit to ensure your water is not too acidic . You should always disconnect and cover any water catchment systems . If the pH of the water is low ( acidic ) you can dissolve a couple boxes of baking soda into water and dump that into the water barrel ever 2-4 weeks to raise the pH . Of course , any water collected from outside sources should already be charcoal filtered and boiled to remove bacteria and this should also remove lead and copper content .
Visibility :
The ash that blows out during a volcanic eruption can travel high enough to disrupt commercial airline flights and spread out many miles from the volcano . There can be days of thick ash at ground level making visibility near nonexistent . If you feel you have to drive in these conditions , keep headlights on low and go very slow . Try not to use water on your windshield to clean it if you can as it will turn the ash into a paste that will just smear on your windshield .
Driving :
Your vehicle was design to drive in fairly clean air . It has an air intake filter that will catch minor particulates , but will become completely clogged within minutes of driving through volcanic ash . If you live in proximity to a volcano with a good chance of eruption , you should do some pre planned modifications ahead of time to your bug out vehicle . Most newer vehicles have built in filtration systems for cabin air , but adding extra layers of filtration could n't hurt . If you have an older vehicle you will probably need to design and install a filtration system to ensure ash does not flood the cabin while you drive . You can also install a vacuum system to suck ash away from your engine air intake like the Washington State Patrol did during Mt . Saint Helens . Naturally you will have to empty out the vacuum occasionally , but it will at least get you down the road and eventually to a place where the ash is thinner .
Unless you are able to make it out of the area before the eruption happens and if you do n't live in an evacuation zone , your best bet is to bug in and wait for the dust to settle . Once the air clears a bit , you can head for greener pastures , but trying to travel through the ash is generally going to put you in more danger than just staying put . If you have backup food and water , stay sealed inside .
If you live right up next to any of these volcanoes , the best prep would be to move . If you do n't have the financial means to do that or you just plain do n't want to , listen for the early warning signs and evacuate as soon as you think your safety is threatened .

PARIS , Jan 7 ( Reuters ) - Black-hooded gunmen shot dead at least 11 people at the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo , a satirical publication firebombed in the past after publishing cartoons lampooning Muslim leaders and the Prophet Mohammad , police said .
President Francois Hollande headed to the scene of the attack and the government said it was raising France 's security level to the highest notch .
“ This is a terrorist attack , there is no doubt about it , ” Hollande told reporters .
Another 10 people were injured in the incident and police union official Rocco Contento described the scene inside the offices as “ carnage ” .
“ About a half an hour ago two black-hooded men entered the building with Kalashnikovs ( rifles ) , ” witness Benoit Bringer told the TV station . “ A few minutes later we heard lots of shots , ” they said , adding that the men were then seen fleeing the building .
France is already on high alert after calls last year from Islamist militants to attack its citizens and interests in reprisal for French military strikes on Islamist strongholds in the Middle East and Africa .
British Prime Minister David Cameron described the attack as sickening .
Late last year , a man shouting “ Allahu Akbar ” ( “ God is greatest ” ) injured 13 by ramming a vehicle into a crowd in the eastern city of Dijon . Prime Minister Manuel Valls said at the time France had “ never before faced such a high threat linked to terrorism ” .
A firebomb attack gutted the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo , a publication that has always courted controversy with satirical attacks on political and religious leaders , in November 2011 after it put an image of the Prophet Mohammad on its cover .
The last tweet on Charlie Hebdo 's account mocked Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , the leader of the Islamic State , which has taken control of large swathes of Iraq and Syria .

The top Republican senator overseeing the confirmation of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state said Thursday that Tillerson will not be asked release their tax returns as part of their confirmation process .
Sen. Bob Corker 's ( R-TN ) announcement comes after Democrats had been urging Corker to demand that that Tillerson 's financials be thoroughly vetted .
Corker , head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said in a statement that it has been `` long-standing precedent '' for the committee not to require nominees to release their taxes .
`` He already has submitted a completed nominee questionnaire and will soon submit an extensive financial disclosure . Furthermore , prior to their confirmation hearing , they will go through the same ethics and FBI checks as previous Secretary of State nominees , '' Corker said .
`` That has always been the plan , it is already in progress , and I am deeply disappointed my colleagues continue to imply otherwise , '' they added .
Sen. Ben Cardin , the top Democrat on the committee , and fellow Democrats have been demanding that Tillerson , the head of a a multinational corporation , release three years of their taxes as a prerequisite to be confirmed to the top diplomatic post .
Sean Bartlett , a spokesperson to Cardin , said that a questionnaire section to be filled out by the nominee about taxes is `` standard . ''
`` The majority staff and the Trump transition team were informed by the minority staff that we were asking for ( the tax returns ) in person and in writing . We 're still asking , '' Bartlett said .
While it is difficult for Democrats , who only have 48 members , to block Tillerson 's confirmation , they could slow it down , especially if questions remain about Tillerson 's personal financial interests .
A top senior Democratic aide said tax transparency is not an `` unreasonable '' request for this unique nominee .
`` Given that he 's the CEO of a company that has investments in over 80 countries around the world , it 's not unreasonable to see relevant documents that will ensure he 's working on behalf of the country , and not their own bottom line , '' the aide wrote in an email . `` It 's a shame they seem ready to take a play out of the President-elect 's playbook and withhold their taxes from the American people . ''
President-elect Donald Trump , also a business person with financial interests around the world , did not release their taxes , breaking from protocol followed by nearly every presidential nominee since 1976 to do so .
Sen. Cardin wrote a letter to their colleagues Thursday saying they have made little headway with Corker over Tillerson 's taxes .
Tillerson is required to fill out the standard , less detailed , financial disclosure form . Cardin wrote to their colleagues that they will wait to examine the financial disclosure documents before determining if they will object to the hearing date , which is expected to be scheduled for January 11 .
`` I think it is an important part of vetting this candidate because they have never made public disclosures of this type , as they have worked at ExxonMobil for their entire career and has never been in public service , '' Cardin wrote in the letter .
Republican leaders are hoping to have at least half a dozen of Trump 's nominees confirmed before their inauguration on January 20 .
Last week , Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , a Tea Party favorite and likely 2016 presidential candidate , was in Los Angeles to accept an award from the conservative Claremont Institute . The award is called the Statesmanship Award and was delivered to Cruz as part of the institute 's annual dinner honoring Winston Churchill .
In their acceptance speech , Cruz said a bunch of very Cruz-y things . Boldness . Principles . Reagan . Conservative . Reagan , again .
Advertisement :
At one point , though , Cruz launched into a brief imitation of Churchill , pretending to be the former British prime minister delivering one of their famous Word War II speeches . Judged against a standard of what Winston Churchill actually sounded like , the impression was a total disaster . But if we judge the impression by a different standard , it has its virtues .
For example , as the Vine video from BuzzFeed 's Andrew Kaczynski below can attest , Cruz 's Churchill was an absolute success if the standard used is one that privileges the ability to make its listener go insane over more traditional measurements , like accuracy .
Seriously , try to watch the video below ( with the sound on ! ) more than 10 times in a row without going completely bonkers . Or do n't — especially if you have n't gotten health insurance yet .
We released Zanshin 0.2 alpha2 in May , it was about time we got our acts together to prepare another release . So today I 'm happy to announce the immediate availability of Zanshin 0.2 beta1 !
It is the result of further bugfixing and testing work . We got some feedback from early users of 0.2 alpha2 and it 's been reflected in our bug hunting efforts .
Since the previous one was an alpha we still had the freedom to add a couple more features . The features introduced for that beta were rather non-intrusive though , the main ones are :
the ability to set categories on projects , to-dos inside such projects automatically inherit from those categories ( greatly reduces the tagging needs ) ;
the ability to synchronize collections directly from Zanshin ;
and last but not least a Kontact plugin , now Zanshin can work embedded in Kontact ( this one was actually a feature request , I did n't even think about it ) . : - )
Now that we 're entering the beta cycle , we 're also publishing source tarballs . Of course , I still produce packages to openSUSE , although for the time being they 're only built against KDE : Unstable : SC , I 'm waiting for kdepim 4.7 to hit other repos before supporting more . Those packages are available in my home : ervin repository .
And of course , you can still git clone kde : zanshin if you want the bleeding edge or if you wish to contribute .
We plan to release Zanshin 0.2 beta2 somewhat soon after the Desktop Summit . We 're only in bugfixing and stabilization mode now , no new feature will be introduced until we release 0.2 .
Enjoy !
Unite says apparent threat of disciplinary action for calling in sick is ‘ a shocking example ' but quite normal across industry
The restaurant chain Wagamama has apologised after workers at a branch in London were threatened with disciplinary action if they called in sick .
A staff notice appended to a rota for the Christmas period told workers that “ calling in sick during the next two weeks will result in disciplinary action being taken ” , according to a copy sent to the Unite trade union .
Unite said one of its members had sent it the document , and while “ it may be a shocking example … it 's sadly quite normal across the industry – particularly at this time of year ” .
A Wagamama spokesperson confirmed that the report was accurate but said that it was an isolated incident . “ The manager involved feared team member shortages over the festive period and regrettably decided to take this highly unusual approach , ” the spokesperson said .
The statement continued : “ We sincerely apologise for what has happened and wish all our team members and customers a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year . ”
The note read : “ No calling in sick ! May I remind you that if you are unable to come for your shift it is your responsibility to find somebody to cover your shift ( as per contract and handbook ) . Calling in sick during the next two weeks will result in disciplinary action being taken . ”
The Labour MP Frank Field was critical of the threat of disciplinary action , saying : “ Even a brief glimpse of such Scrooge-like behaviour is enough to make anyone feel sick , let alone actually having to work for a company behaving this way . I 'm sure Wagamama 's customers would feel sick too , knowing that staff are on the receiving of this rotten behaviour over Christmas . ”
In a Facebook post , Unite 's hospitality division said : “ This is why we need to come together in a union to stop such exploitation . Fair Hospitality [ a Unite campaign ] was created for that very purpose . Get involved and let 's transform the sector , together . ”
Before the chain apologised , circulation of the note sparked a # boycottwagamama campaign on social media as people expressed anger at the threat to workers and voiced concern that the approach could put customers ' health at risk by forcing unwell kitchen and restaurant workers to undertake shifts when they are carrying contagious illnesses .
Wagamama employs 4,800 people and has 166 branches in the UK , most of which are operated directly but some of which have franchise agreements . Last year , the company made a £34m profit .
Courage is standing in the streets demanding the end of a thirty year despotic dictatorship , in a country with no tradition of democracy or the protection human rights .
Cowardice is talking about how other people should have human rights delivered to them by foreign militaries .
Courage is risking your life to bring democracy to your country .
Cowardice is talking about democracy for others while actually undermining it when you do n't like the results .
Courage is walking like an Egyptian .
Cowardice is talking like a neocon .
It 's impossible not to admire the courage of the Egyptian people , walking daily into the maws of a repressive regime and its violent goon squads , willing to sacrifice everything in order to end decades of American-backed autocracy in their country .
And it 's impossible not to be embarrassed by the silence of the American right , who bloviate endlessly about bringing democracy to the Middle East , but have gone somehow all quiet lately . These folks could n't have been more excited two years ago when the Iranian public was doing exactly what the Egyptians are doing now , but for some reason they are n't out there cheering this time . Hmm . I wonder , what could be the difference ?
Actually , it 's just most of them that are silent . We should be so lucky where the others are concerned . Glenn Beck is completely out of their tree , although that 's about as surprising as stink on a turd , and about as pleasant . They have decided that the democracy movement in Egypt is the beginning of the much-predicted and much-feared rise of the Muslim caliphate . Um , even though it is being led by young people with a secular agenda , and the Muslim Brotherhood has been on the sidelines . They have declared that this is part of some great big ol ' conspiracy that involves jihadists and socialists and lesbians and Barack Obama . Um , even though , those are n't crowds who normally have lots to do with one another . Oh well , if their ( thankfully diminishing , not to mention diminished ) audience can buy the fantasy that the secularist Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11 and thus belly up for a ten-year war on that basis , why not see Obamacare-death-panel-commie-pinko-fag conspiracies on the streets of Cairo as well ? It makes about as much sense . It 's about as contradictory as Jesus supporting capitalism , a notion which any good regressive will be happy to argue today . Logic never before stopped that locomotive from going off the rails at a hundred miles per hour , and it is n't now .
Okay , well , Beck is sorta sui generis ( or so it 's a bit comforting to think ) . What 's happening on the 'sane ' right , where politics is only sometimes based on wild conspiracy theories ? The answer that they do n't know what the hell to do with themselves . Egypt has exposed them as liars , hypocrites and autocrats , and it ai n't exactly a comfortable place to be in .
Take the exquisitely appropriately named Charles Krauthammer ( please ) as an example . You wo n't need to devote a whole lot of processing cycles from the CPU between your ears to figure out what he 's up to once you see the title of their latest piece : `` Egypt 's Dangerous Road Ahead : The Muslim Brotherhood 's A Force , ElBaradei 's A Useful Idiot '' . Just the same , they start off the piece by asking `` Who does n't love a democratic revolution ? Who is not moved by the renunciation of fear and the reclamation of dignity in the streets of Cairo and Alexandria ? ''
Great question , but guess who , after all , it turns out does n't seem to love a democratic revolution so very much ? ! ? ! Instead of waxing joyous about the redemptive delivery of democracy to the Middle East - you know , like they did when Iran 's public was rising up , or like when they were justifying the Iraq invasion - Herr Blitzkrieg is instead all full of warnings , danger signs and bogeymen . 'Cause , you know , we all remember how the French Revolution went awry : `` The romance could be forgiven if this were Paris 1789 . But it is not . In the intervening 222 years , we have learned how these things can end . ''
Wait , did n't the Americans once have a revolution too ? Would Krauthammer have warned against that one ? You bet . As a matter of fact , just about the only thing that allows regressives to continue to exist at all is the severe historical amnesia of the American public . The plain truth is that the right opposes every progressive movement in its time - just as they oppose gay rights today , and women 's rights yesterday , and racial civil rights just before that - and then pretends to celebrate it a generation or two later . Of course they would have opposed the American Revolution . We know that because : They did ! They were called tories , and they in fact sided with the monarchical , repressive Brits . No doubt Hamiltonians would have been seen as the surreptitious Muslim Brotherhood equivalents of the time , threatening the freedom that monarchy provides , with George Washington playing the role of their useful idiot . He 'd be even more 'idiotic ' if , like ElBaradei , they also happened as head of the IAEA to have committed the cardinal sin of making the WMD-chanting neocon lunatics who demanded the Iraq adventure look like , well , idiots .
The right gives themselves away when they are confronted with the possible outcome they claim to desire in the public interest , but which turns out to be nothing more than marketing blabber . Why , for example , do their tax cuts for the wealthy always seem to be paramount , even when they result in a massive increase to the national debt that regressives are so fond of ranting against ? Why must Cuba be strangled , but China traded with ? And why does Krauthammer write , concerning Egypt , that `` We are told by sage Western analysts not to worry about the Brotherhood because it probably commands only about 30 % of the vote . This is reassurance ? In a country where the secular democratic opposition is weak and fractured after decades of persecution , any Islamist party commanding a third of the vote rules the country . ''
The bloody truth is that these regresso-monsters could n't possibly care less about democracy , except to be sure to block it wherever it interferes with their real agenda . In the case of Egypt , the exposure of their hypocrisy could not be more complete if we had video from a neocon nude beach party . Wait , never mind . Dick Cheney and Peggy Noonan in the buff ? Euw . Some metaphors are too horrible to contemplate , despite their illuminating power .
On and on went the likes of Wolfowitz and Rice and Krauthammer about the need to bring democracy to the Middle East , even if that meant launching a war in Iraq which was disastrous in every way imaginable . But , of course , democracy was neither the goal nor outcome in that country , which today has three far more likely scenarios in front of it : either a reversion to Saddam-like dictatorship , civil war , and/or centrifugal explosion into at least three countries instead of one .
Similarly , the Bush administration went on and on about the need for the Palestinians to embrace democracy , until they actually did it . Lo and behold , when elections were held and Hamas won a crushing defeat , the US immediately began undermining the new government 's legitimacy . But that 's hardly news . American efforts to undermine democracy in the Middle East date back to at least 1953 , with the toppling of the democratically elected Iranian government , whose great crime was to piss-off British Petroleum by asserting the ludicrous notion that Iranian oil should belong to Iranians . What cheeky little brown bastards , eh ? !
But killing Iraqis to set them free was always logically absurd , anyhow , for anyone who does n't take their politics as a religion ( literally and figuratively ) , and is willing to examine with even the slightest scintilla of scrutiny the right 's daily dose of dogma for dummies . Iraq was supposed to be a model in the region , which other states would then follow . But that concept was always idiotic from the get-go because the model was already there - indeed , had been there , more or less , for a century - right next door . Turkey was and is a majority Islamic state that is nevertheless pretty solidly democratic and mostly secular , often quite adamantly so . Why did perhaps a million people have to die in order to have a democratic model in the Middle East when there already was one , right there ?
Even more ludicrous was the continuing close relationship between the United States - especially Republicans , and especially especially the House of Bush - with the autocracies of the Middle East we 're supposedly meant to be democratizing . I mean , really , if the US government wanted to democratize the Middle East , why not just pull a Saudi prince or two aside for a chat at the next family barbeque ? Why not pick up the phone , call Mubarak and tell them to quit screwin ' around with their whole secret police thing ? And , if they did n't get the message , why not just stop sending them gobs of money ? Or stop training those very secret police ? You know , why not apply a little of that much-vaunted conservative tough love ?
The reason is the same explanation for why no one on the right is embracing real democracy as it is occurring right before our eyes in Egypt , right now . It is n't democracy that is desired by these chickenhawk cowards , who all seemed to have been quite preoccupied with studying Machiavelli or business administration when the US was 'bringing democracy ' to Vietnam during their era , and thus , goshdarnit , unfortunately had to miss the war . Despite the breathtaking bravery of the Egyptian public seeking to overthrow their American stooge-tyrant and their violent squads of mercenary goons , regressives do n't seem quite moved , other than to cynicism . And as for Nobel Peace Prize winners who are out on the streets risking life and limb , and who might be the perfect match for the moment , they are `` useful idiots '' . Instead , says Krauthammer , let 's have a military dictatorship to replace the political one , and give us what we really want : `` The overriding objective is a period of stability during which secularists and other democratic elements of civil society can organize themselves for the coming elections and prevail . ElBaradei is a menace . Mubarak will be gone one way or the other . The key is the military . The U.S. should say very little in public and do everything behind the scenes to help the military midwife - and then guarantee - what is still something of a long shot : Egyptian democracy . ''
The military ? Does Krauthammer mean the same military that has been propping up the Mubarak regime for thirty years ? The one with deep ties to the US and even Israel ? The one that seems to be doing little of use during the current crisis ? Gosh , I 'm confused . Maybe he 's thinking of a different Egyptian army .
Did I mention Israel ? That is , of course , one of the main - if not the top - reason that neocons hate the idea of democracy in region , and undermine it everywhere they can , except in places like Iran . What is happening in Egypt is brilliant and inspirational for any number of reasons , but one of them is that it will effectively knock the stool out from underneath the arrogant , repressive and petulant foreign policy of the Israelis . Their ongoing unwillingness to forsake a transparent colonialism project in exchange for peace in the region will now likely be far less sustainable . As long as Israel no longer had to worry about neighbors like Egypt and Jordan reacting to their land-grabs and wholesale human rights violations , they could act with impunity . For years , everyone has been waiting for an American government to clip Israel 's wings , as seemingly the only solution to the protracted crisis , but it never happened . No one ever thought about the other fundamental assumptions on which Israeli policy is predicated . Now they are .
Which is , also , no doubt why Barack Obama is once again playing the role of historical bystander they seem to find so comforting . Mr . Incremental . Mr. Behind-The-Scenes . Mr. Change-You-Believe-In-As-Long-As-You-Do-It-For-Yourself . It 's disgusting . Look , you 're either the bat or you 're the ball , and Obama 's got plenty of stitches to show emphatically which side of the equation he 's on , despite the awesome powers of the American presidency that they possess , something none of the rest of us have at our disposal . Including every one of those kids on the streets of Cairo , Alexandria and Suez getting their heads cracked open . They know a thing or two about the effect of baseball bats . And they know which side America has always been on , and which side it is on now . Is this supposed to be prudent , realist , foreign policy ? Just exactly how do they think a new regime is going to treat America after decades of US sponsored repression and then hostility to a liberating revolutionary movement at the moment when crunch time hits ? Gee , I dunno . Can you say 'Iran ' ? Why does 'Mubarak ' all of a sudden improbably rhyme so well with 'Pahlavi ' ?
The train of liberation has left the station , and may traverse across much of the Middle East before all is said and done . The question is not whether the train will roll , but only whether each of us will be on board , on the platform , or digging up the rails .
Bottom line , ladies and gentlemen , these are our moral choices :
Walk like an Egyptian .
Talk like a Neocon .
Gawk like an Obama .
I do n't know about anyone else , but I 'm with the kids on the streets of Cairo .
As for the United States and its leadership of old men dressed in young people 's clothing , the world is passing us by .
It should . We 're dinosaurs .
On a good day .

New Meadowlands Stadium will be renamed for MetLife , the insurance company , possibly as early as next week . The Jets and Giants , who have been without the income from a naming rights deal , would split $ 17 million to $ 20 million annually over 20 years , according to published reports .
MetLife 's interest in the stadium , where it is currently a cornerstone sponsor paying about $ 7 million annually , was first reported in June by Sports Business Journal .
The pending announcement of the deal would come about three years after a more lucrative naming rights agreement with Allianz , a German-based insurer , collapsed amid reporting in The New York Times about the company 's ties to the Nazi government before and during World War II .
If MetLife 's contract averages as much as $ 20 million annually , it will equal what Citigroup is paying to have its name on Citi Field , the home of the Mets . The other sports facilities in the New York metropolitan area with corporate names are the Prudential Center , the home of the Devils ; Barclays Center , the future home of the Nets ; and Red Bull Arena , where the Red Bulls play . The new Yankee Stadium , which opened in 2009 , did not sell a naming rights sponsorship . Madison Square Garden has no plans to change its iconic name .
And the Nassau Coliseum , where the Islanders play , has never had a corporate name on it .
MONTREAL -- Quebec 's highest court has upheld the verdict and sentence in the case of a woman who stopped to help ducks along a highway causing a crash that claimed two lives .
The Quebec Court of Appeal on Thursday rejected Emma Czornobaj 's challenge in a 35-page written decision that came nearly seven years after the events .
Shortly after Czornobaj , now 28 , stopped their car in June 2010 to rescue ducklings on the side of a provincial highway just south of Montreal , a motorcycle carrying Andre Roy and their teenage daughter , Jessie , slammed into the idling vehicle . Both died as a result of the crash .
Roy 's wife , Pauline Volikakis , was on another motorcycle behind the victims , but was able to stop and avoid serious injury .
Czornobaj , who was 21 at the time , was n't in the car , which was stopped in the left lane .
They told their trial they wanted to bring the ducklings home .
`` I just wanted to pick all these ducklings up and put them in my car , '' Czornobaj testified at the time . `` I know it was a mistake . ''
Confronted during cross-examination by the Crown , they disagreed their actions were illogical .
`` At the time , it 's what I decided to do , '' Czornobaj said . `` Obviously now I would not have stopped . ''
A jury convicted them in June 2014 of two counts of criminal negligence causing death and two counts of dangerous driving causing death .
They were sentenced in December 2014 to 90 days in jail to be served on weekends , three years ' probation and 240 hours of community service , and given a 10-year driving ban .
Czornobaj appealed in early 2015 , and their sentence was put on hold .
The appeals were heard in April by three justices . Them lawyer sought to have their conviction set aside due to what they called inadequate instructions to the jury by the trial judge .
Them lawyer , Jean-Francois Bouveret , appealed the conviction and sought to have the decade-long driving ban reduced , but they failed .
`` In short , both the objective and subjective gravity of the offence allowed the imposition of the sentence imposed by the judge , including the prolonged prohibition on driving , '' Justice Etienne Parent wrote in a unanimous decision .
`` I recall that the period of incarceration inflicted on the appellant , 90 days to be served in a discontinued fashion , is an exceptionally lenient punishment . ''
A call to Bouveret was not immediately returned on Thursday .

Joel Colindrés , a beloved father of two with no criminal record , is facing imminent deportation to Guatemala .
Samantha Colindrés knows July 20 , 2017 , will go down in their family 's history as one of the worst days ever . That 's when they learned their husband , Joel , was given less than a month to end life as they know it , abandon them and their two kids , leave their job and their home , and move back to Guatemala .
Joel Colindrés is not a criminal . They came to this country more than a decade ago . They are employed . They own a house . They pay taxes . They do not drink alcohol and has never done drugs . They are , to their wife and two young children , the perfect husband , the world 's greatest dad .
That horrible day in July , though , they became one of scores of undocumented workers who had been granted permission to stay in the United States only to suddenly be ordered out as part of President Donald Trump 's sweeping roundup of immigrants . That July 20 , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) told them to be out of the country by Aug. 17 .
They had 28 days .
“ That was when I collapsed , ” Samantha Colindrés said in an interview with Patch . “ I started screaming , I started crying , I could n't breathe and I was hyperventilating . … I kept screaming that they had two children , two small children . ”
That day was only the third time they had seen their husband cry . The other two were when their two children were born . Son Preston is 6 now . Daughter Lila is 2 .
Although Joel Colindrés spent years trying to follow the government 's rules to become a citizen , never so much as parking illegally , they now must leave their country of more than a decade because ICE misspelled their name in a court filing , according to their attorney .
Joel Colindrés is not alone . According to statistics reported by the Washington Post , the number of undocumented immigrant arrests rose by roughly one-third in the first months of the Trump administration . Most of those arrested had no criminal record — the type of people Trump , on the campaign trail , said they would not disturb .
“ Joel is the epitome of the American dream , ” the couple 's attorney , Erin O'Neil Baker , said in an interview with Patch . “ He has built such a beautiful and successful life here for themselves … but unfortunately they are also the epitome of what the Trump administration is currently doing , which is taking everyone who does not have legal status and grouping them all together . ”
What Happened ?
According to Joel Colindrés , a number of thoughts raced through their head while they were confined to the same immigration office where they had checked in twice already since May . This time , they were forbidden to leave until they received an ankle bracelet to monitor theirs whereabouts .
Twenty-eight days to get out , they were told . Twenty-eight days .
“ I was totally in shock , and I did n't know what to do , ” they recalled . “ It 's very hard knowing you have 28 days to leave the country . I have a lot of people that I love here , especially my kids . ”
Joel Colindrés came to the United States 13 years ago from Guatemala through Texas via a legal provisional waiver . Their wife and children still in their future , they headed to New York , where some relatives lived , and spent years going through the necessary steps to become a citizen .
The process was moving along . Then ICE officials spelled their name wrong on a document , the family 's attorney told Patch .
Due to the error , the attorney said , Joel Colindrés never received an important letter — and missed a court date as a result . They were then issued a removal order in 2004 .
They continued sending necessary documents to ICE over the years , the attorney said , both when they were single and after they married and had their two kids . For years , they checked in regularly with ICE agents , as their waiver required , and everything was deemed fine , every time , for them to continue to stay .
In a response sent to Patch about the case Tuesday , ICE misspelled “ Colindrés ” as “ Calinders . ”
Below is ICE 's statement in full .
“ Joel Calinders-Guerra , an illegally present citizen of Guatemala , was issued a final order of removal by a federal immigration judge in 2004 . Since then they have sought relief from removal via several court actions and has been denied each . On July 20 , during a routine check-in , ICE chose not to take Calinders into custody and instead placed them in a GPS monitoring program . They were instructed to report back to ICE with an itinerary as proof they intend to comply with their removal order . ”
“ We have been doing this process the right way for years , ” Samantha Colindrés said .
Baker , the family 's attorney , said these types of mistakes are not uncommon . When an individual enters the United States , they might not have permanent residency , meaning they do not have a long-term address to give when they are first are detained by ICE , they said .
In many of these cases , the attorney said , an immigrant will provide the address where they are currently living , but may eventually move . And even if they give their new address to the court , sometimes there is a cross in the mail , and the court wo n't receive the new address before the hearing .
“ There are a lot of reasons why a person might not get the right notice for the right time and might not appear , ” Baker said in an interview with Patch . “ And really , that is a death knell to someone 's immigration history , unfortunately . It is extremely difficult to reopen a removal order and prove to the court that it is the court 's fault they did not get notice . The burden really falls on the individual to prove they have done everything proper in notifying the court . ”
Before they took on the family 's case , Baker said the issue of improper notice was already litigated in full , with no success . So they said they will instead be filing a motion to reopen Joel Colindrés ' removal order with the board of immigration appeals on a different basis .
“ We are moving forward on a strong argument that Joel can not return to their country because there has been a systematic targeting of their family members , ” Baker said , “ and , unbeknownst to Joel , three of their family members were murdered in the last year . ”
These murders only recently came to light . Joel 's family had kept it from him , Baker said , because they did n't want them to be upset .
A number of news stories have popped up this year about immigrants who were facing deportation , but were allowed to stay thanks to last-minute support from government officials . Recently , Norwalk resident Nury Chavarria , a single mother of four , took sanctuary in a New Haven church in an attempt to avoid deportation .
In that case , Chavarria was granted an emergency stay on July 26 .
Samantha Colindrés is hoping their husband will be able to join the list of those who made headlines and were eventually permitted to remain with their loved ones in America .
“ Their case is very strong in the sense that if Joel did n't have this removal order , then they would be very easily eligible for residency , ” Baker said . “ He has an approved marriage petition and a pending waiver . Once that waiver is granted , the removal order is basically expunged . They are following the rules , the laws are in place , the policies are in place , he 's doing the normal process , but it 's this old removal order that is the hindrance , and all they seek is their time here in [ America ] for the next six months so these pending applications can be approved . ”
In the meantime , the couple is in “ fight mode ” — protecting the children from their father 's plight while preparing for the worst and working as hard as they can to push back against the order .
Fight Mode
“ This was a day that will go down in history for all of our lives , ” Samantha Colindrés said of July 20 , “ and one that I do n't think we will ever forget . ”
Right after the couple received the bad news , they shared their story in a lengthy Facebook post .
“ I never put stuff on Facebook , ” Samantha Colindrés said . “ Once in a while I post a cute kid picture or something , but nothing like this . ”
They were originally unsure if the post would reach a lot of people . By the end of the weekend , though , it had already been shared 10,000 times . Since gaining traction on social media , the two have not stopped moving .
“ We 've been just go-go for the past week and half , ” Samantha Colindrés said . “ We just kind of went straight to fight mode , and we 're not going to stop until we get this story out there . ”
The two held a rally Thursday in Hartford to # SaveJoelColindres , garnering the support of nearly 100 people .
The rally “ was amazing , but it was also sad in a way , ” Samantha Colindrés said . “ We were seeing all this wonderful support , but for something that should not even be happening . It was n't the kind of support you see when someone gets a new job or has a baby ; it was like support for somebody having to leave this country that should not have been given this notice in the first place . ”
Support has also poured in from local government officials , including Sen. Chris Murphy , a Democrat from Connecticut who said their office has been in close contact with the family and their attorney . They said their team is actively working with ICE to pursue every possible option for the Colindrés family .
“ As a father of two young kids , I can only imagine the pain Joel is going through right now at the thought of having to leave their 6-year-old son Preston and 2-year-old daughter Lila , ” Murphy said in an email . “ The Trump administration once again is irresponsibly targeting families . I think we all agree that our limited law enforcement resources should instead go to deporting dangerous criminals . ”
Samantha Colindrés said the first person they called after receiving the news of their husband 's deportation was Sen. Richard Blumenthal , another Connecticut Democrat with whom they had previously been in contact .
“ The fact that ICE would give a father only 28-days ' notice to leave their wife and children , ” Blumenthal said in an email , “ leaving next to no time to pursue legal remedies , is cold , callous and reprehensible . ICE approved Samantha Colindrés ' application to sponsor their husband 's visa but is now deporting them before they can proceed through the process for obtaining legal status pursuant to that approved sponsorship . ”
Blumenthal also said they think ICE should allow Joel Colindrés to follow through on that sponsorship rather than permanently upend their family 's life .
“ This nightmare is the direct result of the Trump administration 's decision to remove all reason and rationality from its immigration policies , ” Blumenthal said , “ and I continue to implore the President to end this nightmare and commit to true , bipartisan discussions to reform this broken immigration system in a way that respects our fundamental American values and morals . ”
Anger and grief aside , Samantha Colindrés said the huge amount of support their family has received is not going unnoticed .
“ That 's really what has been lifting us up through all this , ” Colindrés said . “ The power of people and social media and strangers . I 'm so thankful that in this day and age we have that kind of reach . ”
They said they hope their family 's still-developing story can inspire other people in similar situations to fight back .
“ Never give up , and just keep fighting for what you believe is right . Do n't be afraid to share your story , ” Samantha Colindrés said . “ We 've had our struggles…but [ we ] are not going to stop fighting for what we believe is right . ”
Father , Friend , Husband
Although Samantha Colindrés and their husband have seen a huge outpouring of support since they received their deportation notice , they have also run into some people who think they might be hiding certain details .
“ Some people will say there has to be more to the story , ” they said . “ That [ Joel ] must be a criminal or something . My husband has honestly never gotten so much as a parking ticket . ”
They said their husband also does not smoke or drink , and has never done a single drug in their life . They are a man of strong faith , they said , who continues to pray every night while wearing their ankle bracelet .
“ He 's everything anyone would want in a father , a friend and a husband , ” Samantha Colindrés said .
The couple 's 6-year-old son is “ very attached ” to their father , they said — so much so that they set their alarm for 6 a.m. every morning just so they can see their dad before they head to work .
The couple has worked to make sure their kids are not exposed to what they are currently dealing with . Yet regardless of their success , they have had to consider what they 'll tell the kids , should their daddy be forced to leave for Guatemala this month .
“ Luckily , with technology , we could FaceTime every day , ” Samantha Colindrés said . “ But even Joel said they ca n't imagine being away from them . They had to meet someone the other day and ended up texting me , ‘ I 'm away from you guys for one hour and it 's hurting me . I ca n't even imagine being away from you all for a day . ' ”
Although the thought of leaving their family weighs heavily on their mind every moment , Joel Colindrés said they still have much to be comforted by as they and their wife continue to fight .
On July 27 , they obtained a delegation letter of support from Blumenthal , Murphy and Rep. Elizabeth Etsy . The letter asks that ICE give a stay of their deportation full and fair consideration .
“ ICE has confirmed that Mr. Colindrés has committed no crimes , contributes to their community , is employed , pays taxes and is raising a family , ” the letter reads . “ He should be granted every consideration possible to remain in the United States and continue their pathway to citizenship . ”
Joel Colindrés said they also take comfort in the strong show of support they have received from neighbors and strangers in America — a nation they love and will do anything to remain a part of .
“ I just want to say thank you for all the support out there . This is an amazing country , and I love this country , ” they said . “ God bless America . ”
Those looking to support the Colindrés family can sign their petition or donate money via a GoFundMe page set up by a friend to cover legal fees and other related financial burdens .

Princess Diana leaked information to the press in an effort to ‘ take on ' their husband , Clive Goodman , a former royal reporter at the shuttered tabloid News of The World said in court today .
Diana was sensationally named by Clive Goodman , a defendant , as the source of a 1992 internal royal phone directory found in their possession .
At the phone hacking trial in London today , Goodman said that the high-level phone directory , known as the Green Book , which contained the personal phone numbers of senior royals , was sent under plain cover to their office in an envelope with their name on it . Princess Diana called them in person later that day , asking Goodman whether they received it .
Goodman said , “ She was going through a very , very difficult time . They told me they wanted me to see the scale of their husband 's staff and household , compared with others .
“ She felt they were being swamped by people close to their household . They were looking for an ally to take them on—to show there were forces that would rage against him . ”
“ She had a relationship with several journalists , ” said Goodman of the call , citing Martin Bashir of Panorama and Richard Kay at the Daily Mail .
Goodman said Diana sent the book because they wanted them to “ see the scale of their husband 's household compared to hers ” and how they were “ being swamped by their household. ” They said Diana was looking for “ an outlet to take them on , ” adding , “ They were quite a powerful organization : they still are . ”
Goodman denied paying for any of the 15 royal phone books found in their possession when police raided their home in 2006 . They also denied using them to hack phones .
Goodman was jailed for four months in 2007 after pleading guilty to intercepting phone messages . They are a defendant in the current trial , facing two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office . One of those counts comprises the charge that they bought an Internal Telephone Directory .
The court heard today that when police raided their home they found seven copies of the “ Internal Phone Directory ” —which lists all numbers at the palace , including administrative and switchboard numbers , and were for “ foot soldiers in the Royal Household ” and seven copies of the more sensitive ‘ Green Book ' which , Goodman said were , “ a directory of names addresses and telephone numbers of senior members of Royal Household. ” The Green Books contained the private phone numbers of some senior royal family members .
“ It sounds very Upstairs/Downstairs ” said Goodman 's lawyer , David Spens , QC , of the distinction between Green Books and ITDs : “ Yes , very Downton Abbey , ” agreed Goodman .
Goodman also said that another directory , from 1988 was given to the News of The World in 1995 by the son of Kenneth Stronach , a disaffected valet to the Prince of Wales . “ It became clear their father was thoroughly fed up with working for the Royal Household , and the Prince of Wales in particular , ” Goodman said .
Goodman said that “ most of the information in the directories could be found elsewhere ” and denied ever using information in the Green Books for phone hacking . They said they used them to “ get around the press office ” and call people direct when they needed to put a story to them out of hours . They said that on the night of Diana 's death , for example , “ using the Green Book I was able to contact Sir Robin Janver , the Queen 's private secretary ” as , in the middle of the night , “ the palace press office was quite frankly useless . ”
As late as 2001 , there were only six mobile phone numbers listed in the ITD , the court heard . In December the court heard that Andy Coulson , who replaced Rebekah Brooks as editor of News of the World in 2003 was warned by Goodman about the risks they were taking by acquiring the phone directories , let alone using them to hack phones . “ These people will not be paid in anything other than cash because if they 're discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal charges , as could we , ” Goodman allegedly wrote to Coulson , in an email read in court . Coulson , who is alleged to have been conducting an affair with Rebekah Brooks , then the editor of the Sun , at the time , later became Prime Minister David Cameron 's head of communications at Number Ten Downing Street .
Diana 's co-operation with journalists to incriminate the royal family is , of course , legendary . In the most celebrated case , they passed tapes they had recorded to the Daily Mail 's Andrew Morton , in which they laid out in detail their grievances against Prince Charles , and described in detail their suicide attempts and eating disorders .
Flynn Case Highlights Deep Political Corruption of US Security Services
Former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is cooperating with the Special Counsel Robert Mueller to determine whether Donald Trump 's associates colluded with Russian government officials during the 2016 electoral campaign and also in the two months before president-elect Trump assumed office on January 20th . Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) special agents regarding two late December telephone exchanges with former Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak .
The first call was initiated at the request of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and related to Russia 's possible use of its United Nations Security Council veto to stop a resolution condemning Israel 's illegal settlements , as the Barack Obama Administration had decided to abstain to send a message of disapproval to Tel Aviv . If Russia had agreed , which it did not , it would have meant conniving with Moscow to do something sought by Israel and opposed by the elected government still in power in Washington .
The second call possibly was requested by Donald Trump themselves and was made while Flynn was lying on a beach in the Dominican Republic . It sought Russian agreement not to escalate the tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats that had been set in motion by the outgoing Obama administration . Russia delayed any possible expulsions , eventually implementing them when the Trump administration proved unable to mitigate other sanctions put in place by Obama . Both phone calls took place after the American election . Neither had anything to do with possible collusion regarding the election .
Flynn 's admission that they were lying is believed to be part of an agreement with Mueller , presumably eliminating a possible jail sentence and reducing the actual penalty to payment of a fine . Mueller will undoubtedly seek Flynn 's evidence confirming that they and both Kushner and Trump were all acting in violation of the Logan Act of 1799 , which they quite possibly had never heard of , that bars private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments on behalf of the United States . At the time of the phone calls , neither Flynn nor Kushner nor Trump held any actual government office , but it should also be pointed out that no one has ever been convicted under the Logan Act and the de facto status of an incoming administration as a precedent for engaging with foreign powers has never been tested .
The Logan Act aside , the real purpose of the investigation is to “ get ” Russia and its President Vladimir Putin . If it were otherwise , Mueller would be looking hard at the Israeli connection since it is clear from the timeline that Israel had approached Kushner who then asked Flynn to make the phone call . The New York Times described the sequence of events as “ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked the Trump transition team to lobby other countries to help Israel… ” The Israeli overture is a clear example of actual foreign government interference in United States politics and foreign policy , but the interference was by Israel and not by Russia .
The Flynn case is also a prime example of how the American security services have been politically corrupted , but it is unlikely that Mueller will have any interest in that aspect of the case as the investigation itself has become little more than a political witch hunt in which the Washington-New York Establishment is seeking to explain why its candidate lost in November . Flynn was interviewed by the FBI regarding their two phone conversations on January 24th shortly after assumed office as National Security Adviser . During their interview , they were not made aware that the Bureau already had recordings and transcripts of their phone conversations , so , in a manner of speaking , they were being set-up to fail . Mis-remembering , forgetting or attempting to avoid implication of others in the administration would inevitably all be plausibly construed as lying since the FBI knew exactly what was said .
The argument used to justify the possible Flynn entrapment by the FBI , i.e . that there was unauthorized contact with a foreign official , is in itself curious as such contact is not in itself illegal . And it also opens the door to the Bureau 's investigating other individuals who have committed no crime but who find that they can not recall details of phone calls they were parties to that were being recorded by the government . That can easily be construed as “ lying ” or “ perjury ” with consequences that include possible prison time .
In the ever-expanding category of things considered `` hate crimes '' we can now place political disagreement .
Last week , two young women in Maryland were arrested after allegedly setting fire to a pro-Trump sign hanging near a shopping center . The women—D'Asia Perry , 19 , and Joy Shuford , also 19—acted on `` political differences with the billboard postings '' and were charged with second-degree arson and several counts of malicious destruction of property , according to the state Fire Marshal 's Office . They were also charged for violating Maryland 's statute against crimes committed `` because of another 's race , color , religious beliefs , sexual orientation , or national origin . ''
By committing arson `` with discrimination or malice toward a particular group , or someone 's belief , '' Perry and Shuford earned the hate-crime designation , according to Deputy Chief Fire Marshal Caryn L. McMahon . In charging documents from Princess Anne police , officers wrote that `` the intentional burning of these political signs , along with the beliefs , religious views and race of this political affiliation , directly coincides with the victim . ''
The arson charge makes sense—the Trump sign was private property ( it belonged to Robert Wink , who owns a sporting goods store in the shopping strip ) and the blaze did get a bit out of control , according to firefighters . Vegetarion nearby caught on fire , causing an estimated $ 800 in damage , they say .
But a hate crime ? That 's where this story gets sticky . The government is effectively saying that having any political motive for doing something is as deplorable as doing it out of racism , misogyny , or hatred of LGBT people .
For a number of reasons , libertarians ( myself included ) tend to oppose categorically harsher treatment of offenses motivated on `` hate , '' which has always been a slippery topic to get a legal hold on . But at least the typical criteria for labeling something a hate crime are easy enough to understand—these are offenses motivated by animosity toward a particular identity category ( like race , ethnicity , religion , gender , or sexual orientation ) that we consider either innate/immutable or ( in the case of religion ) at least sacrosanct .
What would it mean to add `` political persuasion '' to these categories ? For one thing , any political disagreement that turned nasty could be classified as a hate crime , leaving the offender ( s ) open to much more severe penalties than they would face for a solo charge of something like assault or harassment . Are there people out there who really think this is desirable , making crimes of political passion especially heinous ?
And of course the possibilities for authoritarian abuse are tremendous . Political protesters arrested for minor offenses could have hate-crime enhancements thrown at them . Any act of civil disobedience would immediately become a hate crime .
Several states have already moved to make cops a class protected by hate-crime statutes . In Louisiana , for instance , resisting arrest could now be considered a hate crime , as C.J . Ciaramella noted here in January .
It 's unlikely the people who first pushed for hate-crime laws would be happy with where they 've headed . But as always , when you give police and prosecutors more power—even under the guise of good intentions—it 's always the people who lose .
Huge news for broadband privacy ! A California bill that would restore many of the privacy protections that Congress stripped earlier this year is headed for a final vote this Friday ,
The bill , A.B . 375 , had languished in the Senate Rules Committee due to the efforts of AT & T , Comcast , and Verizon to deny a vote . But constituents called and emailed their representatives and reporters started asking questions . The overwhelming public support for privacy has so far counteracted the lobbying by telecommunications companies , which will spare no expense to keep the gift handed to them by Congress and the Trump administration .
The legislation is now one step away from landing on the governor 's desk , with final votes set for September 15 , the last day of session . If you live in California , you have 72 hours remaining to call your state Assemblymember and state Senator and tell them to vote AYE for A.B . 375 this Friday .
The Battle Behind the Scenes
Despite widespread public support , A.B . 375 has faced significant procedural hurdles behind the scenes in Sacramento , in part because the bill was introduced late in the legislation cycle in response to the Congressional vote . The bill emerged victorious from two Senate committees with strong votes in July before getting stuck in the Senate Rules Committee in the weeks that followed . Recognizing that they will not beat this bill by the votes , the ISP industry players that opposed the bill ( note , many ISPs in California support AB 375 ) , opted to run out the clock .
On Tuesday , however , the Senate Rules Committee Chair and Senate Leader Kevin de Leon decided to move the bill for a vote , and their committee approved discharging the bill for the Senate floor . Following that step , the California Senate voted 25 to 13 to make it eligible for a final vote . These procedural steps are necessary under California law because bills must be in public display for 72 hours as required by Proposition 54 that was approved by voters in 2016 .
The bill 's final version continues to mirror the now repealed FCC broadband privacy rule and the bill as it stands now would effectively return power to California consumers over their personal data that their ISP obtains from the broadband service . That means your browser history , the applications you use , your location when you use the Internet are firmly controlled by you . If A.B . 375 is enacted , ISPs must have your permission first before they can resell or use that data with third parties beyond providing broadband access services .
Furthermore , the bill expands consumer protection beyond the original FCC rule by banning pay for privacy practices such as AT & T 's effort to charge people $ 30 more for broadband if they did not surrender their private information . While AT & T dropped its plan once the FCC began updating the privacy rules in 2015 , their successful lobbying campaign to repeal the rule had cleared the way for them to revisit plans to roll it back out . If A.B . 375 is law though residents in this state will never face what was essentially a privacy tax .
The stage is set for a final vote this Friday , the last day of session for the California legislature so that it can be sent to the Governor 's office this year . Speak up now to demand that the legislature puts people 's privacy over ISP profits .

Ryanair was forced to correct its website this week after it claimed that Sicily 's capital has been dominated by the Cosa Nostra for 'many years ' .
'Palermo is a forgotten treasure , ' said Ryanair in the tourist guide section on its website , 'dominated for many years by the Mafia and poverty , the city has reclaimed a place among European cultural cities . '
The description sparked outrage from Sicilian regional tourism alderman Cleo Li Catzi and Fabio Giambrone , president of the Gesap company managing Palermo 's Falcone-Borsellino airport .
Officials in Palermo , Sicily have reacted angrily after Ryanair described the city as being run by the Mafia for many years
If you look closely in the circle , you will spot the word 'mafia ' , which has caused outrage in Italy
Users on Twitter reacted to Ryanair 's description of Palermo by describing it as an # epicfail
Ryanair marketing manager Giuseppe Belladone said : 'We are removing the content in question , this is content supplied to us by a third party and this detail escaped an internal check . '
The Sicilian Mafia The Sicilian Mafia , also known as Cosa Nostra ( 'Our Thing ' ) , is a criminal syndicate in Sicily , Italy . It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organizational structure and code of conduct , and whose core activities are protection racketeering and the arbitration of disputes in the black market . Each group , known as a 'family ' , 'clan ' , or 'cosca ' , claims sovereignty over a territory , usually a town or village or a neighbourhood ( borgata ) of a larger city , in which it operates its rackets . Its members call themselves 'men of honour ' , although the public often refers to them as 'mafiosi ' . Police crackdowns in recent years have sought to limit the power of the group . Many key leaders have been arrested and jailed .
'On behalf of Ryanair I want to apologise for what happened .
'The statements do not reflect the content in question or the thoughts of Ryanair on the city of Palermo . '
The site description now speaks of Palermo as 'intoxicating , lively and energetic . '
Twitter users reacted to the description by labelling it as an 'epic fail ' and a 'sensational gaffe ' .
Steve Knox labelled the description 'typical lazy Ryanair , ' and labelled Palermo a 'great city . '
Meanwhile John Hard Tweeted their belief that those upset with the description should 'boycott ' the airline .
However , there are others who have simply stated that the original description was 'telling the truth . '
One supporter on Twitter , interestingly , is a group called 'Live Palermo ' .
They Tweeted to the no-frills airline expressing their 'support ' and Tweeted that they failed to see the 'error ' in the original description .
Sicily is known as the birthplace of the Italian Mafia , however in recent years police crackdowns have detained some of the key players .
Dozens were arrested in 'Operation Apocalypse ' in June last year , with local police saying that two entire Mafia families had been wiped out .
The investigation also solved a 100-year-old murder of a New York police officer .
Extortion , money laundering and drug trafficking are among the offences alleged by the Palermo Anti-Mafia Investigation Department , which co-ordinated the operation - codenamed Apocalypse or Apocalisse in Italian .
'There has n't been a dragnet on this scale in many years , ' finance police Colonel Calogero Scibetta told Reuters at the time .
'These arrests have wiped out two entire mob families . '
In recent years police have dealt severe blows to the Sicilian Mafia , historically Italy 's most powerful criminal group while 'Ndrangheta , which operates out of Calabria at the southern end of the Italian mainland , has grown in strength by becoming a big importer of cocaine .
Chapter 19
Whichever chinese proverb said 'patience is a virtue ' , the man had clearly never had a 14 year old girlfriend whom they had only seen once in almost two months . In reality that man was likely a monk , thus celibate . Which meant no wives , or children , or anything like that . So really what did they know ?
March had come and gone , and soon enough they found themselves in the thick of April . Spring was finally starting to settle in ; warm , light rains and calm overcast skies replaced the stormy , harsh winds of winter . On especially sunny days , it shone down on the trees and flowers . Shuffling off the winter frost , the plants budded anew , with new , freshly green leaves and vivid petals of all sorts .
And Elsa was n't enjoying any of it .
Staring out a restaurant window , scowling at a tree as if it had wronged them somehow , they sat bitter , chewing on the remains of a straw . One hand was busy being used to prop up the plastic , emergency-induction-port for its prolonged torture . With their other hand they tapped restlessly on the edge of the table . Kristoff was being completely ignored , in favor of Elsa festering in their own sadness , brooding ; wasting both their and their free time .
It 's not fair . It 's not fucking fair .
How is it that they and Anna had not found any time whatsoever since their second date to see each other again ? How were their schedules so inflexible that this could happen ? These were two questions that Elsa was desperate to find the answers to , every day they were apart . Well…maybe not every day , but the number was big enough to justify this sort of behavior .
`` Hey… Earth to Elsa , are you there ? ''
They momentarily put their chewing on pause , and shifted their gaze back to the irked blonde sitting in front of them `` Yeah…yeah I 'm sorry , Kristoff . I 've just got like a lot of stuff on my mind . ''
`` That bad , huh ? '' Kristoff asked , pressing them despite that weak attempt at a dismissal .
`` What ? ''
`` How long has it been since you two last saw each other ? ''
Elsa shifted further into their faded red leather seat , their eyes fixated on the tiled ceiling . They let out a sigh as they said `` Thirty-three days . ''
You 're so weird for knowing the exact number .
`` So a month then . ''
`` Almost two , '' they replied , holding up two limp fingers in front of theirs face .
`` It 's a month and two days , Elsa . Not anywhere near two months . '' Even though they were positioned at an angle where they could n't see their face , it was obvious in their tone that they were annoyed at Elsa 's hopelessness . `` Come on now , it ca n't be that bad . ''
Oh if only they knew .
Sure the first week or so was fairly normal , Elsa knew that , being apart for so long was n't new to them But more days passed , and no matter how many times they tried to get together , something always came up . Maybe it was Anna who had a really important test , and maybe it was Elsa . Or sometimes they did find a suitable day but something came up that was out of their hands to change . But that 's okay , they were keeping it together and acting as if nothing was wrong and they seemed fine .
Then came day twenty : the day that the withdrawal symptoms started . In public Elsa was able to control themselves by gnawing on pencils or straws , getting lost in their thoughts , and giving dirty looks to inanimate objects ; but in private , when they were alone , things got bad . Every day they would shout and grovel pitifully into their pillow , and then apologize right afterwards to said pillow . By day twenty five the fluffy stress reliever took on a different use : a… temporary substitute for Anna .
After each nightly phone call , Elsa would hold the pillow tightly across their chest , hoping that the impossible would happen . In the same way that pressure was required to turn coal to diamond , they would squeeze the pillow as hard as they possibly could , just hoping for it to be Anna . And every morning they would wake up disappointed but unsurprised . They needed Anna , and the level of need was worryingly high . It was on the cusp of becoming addictive .
Snuggling a pillow was n't enough , they wanted more . Them imagination had begun to run rampant as it conjured visions of the two being in each other 's presence and never leaving the other 's side ; they envisioned hand holding , hugs , kisses . At night though , when they were alone in their bed , the filter was off and the scenes became far more intimate . Elsa imagined them both , alone in their room , with the moonlight peering through their curtains as they did things that felt so real , so strong and right that ... well needless to say their wrist was sore in the morning .
`` It 's pretty bad ... '' Elsa did n't elaborate , only stating this because they neede an answer .
`` Look , distance is good for a relationship , '' Kristoff advised them `` It 's like a test . If you two can survive being apart for so long , then you can survive anything . ''
`` And you would know this how ? '' they teased , although their grumpiness made it sound much snarkier .
`` Okay ouch . I know I 've hit a dry spell but I 've been in enough relationships that I feel like I know what I 'm talking about here . '' Kristoff leaned over the booth and frowned at the blonde . `` Or would you rather I just tell you that you 're both doomed and should break up now ? ''
`` No ... '' God knows you 've been saying that a lot to yourself either way .
`` Well are you gon na let me be a good friend then ? ''
Elsa frowned as well but could n't look their friend in the eye . Partially because they were completely invading their personal space , but mostly because their expression was oddly intimidating , like a parent waiting silently for their baby to eat their food . And given how much complaining they were doing , they pretty much felt like a child anyway .
`` Fine . '' they grumbled .
`` Thank you , '' Kristoff said exasperatedly as they sat back . `` And as a good friend I 'm telling you that you 'll be okay . Both of you . ''
`` And I believe you , or at least I want to , but ... it just sucks , you know ? '' Elsa took a napkin out of the container and began to rip it to shreds , figuring they had already done enough to them straw .
`` You know people need those , right ? ''
`` Shut up , it 's therapeutic . ''
`` How is that ... '' Kristoff shook their head . `` Never mind . But yeah I know it sucks but think about it like this : the semester ends in a month . If you do n't see them from now until then , well at least you 've got them to yourself for an entire summer . ''
They do have a point .
But it did n't matter to them `` But that 's so far awaaaaaay , '' Elsa continued to whine .
They sighed , looking physically close to giving up on supporting a friend who clearly just wanted someone to hear them bitch and moan . `` Oh my god you are so difficult . ''
Come on Elsa , stop being an ass and show them you actually appreciate their help .
`` No no , I 'm listening to what you 're saying and I get it but just ... '' they halted their attack on the thin piece of paper and crossed their arms on the table , burying their face in between them . `` Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck , '' they groaned . And they had been doing so well with keeping their composure in public before .
Wow you suck at this .
A silence had set for a moment as Kristoff rolled their eyes and crossed their own arms over their chest , waiting for their friend to sit back up and stop wallowing in self-pity .
`` Are you done yet ? ''
`` Just give me a few ... hours . '' they groveled .
`` I do n't think you have a few hours , the guys are gon na be here soon and chances are they 're gon na wonder why you look like I drugged you- ''
`` Who do they think you are , Bill Cosby ? You 're nowhere near that funny . ''
`` -with a drug that makes you the living embodiment of hopelessness . Better ? ''
Elsa would have replied , but before they could their phone piped in . They frantically fished it out of their pocket and brought it into their view . Maybe it was from Anna , informing Elsa that the school had burnt up in a huge fire , that they were let out for the rest of the year and they could spend as much time together as possible .
Who even thinks about stuff like that ?
They sighed disappointedly , finally getting up . `` It 's from my sister . I need to go and pick them up now even though she 's not supposed to be done for like another half hour . ''
`` Wait , seriously ? But what about Flynn and Mulan ? '' Kristoff asked .
They scooped up the ridiculous amount of trash at the booth , even though they had n't even eaten yet , and dumped it in the nearest bin . `` Just tell them I 'm sorry for bailing . ''
`` Okay so if I cross-multiply these two and divide that , it 'll get me ... x=7 , right ? ... Anna ? Are you there ? ''
Anna shook their head , snapping themselves out of their dismal trance and nodded apologetically at their blonde companion . `` Y-yeah , sorry I 'm ... here . And yeah that should be right . I think . ''
Elise was n't letting them off that easily . They tilted their head and gave a concerned look to the redhead . `` Are you okay ? I 've never seen you this spaced out before . ''
`` I 'm fine , really . Just ... tired I guess . '' Anna lied , something they were all too familiar yet dangerously comfortable with .
The truth was that Elsa was n't the only one suffering from withdrawal symptoms . Granted , Anna 's were less severe but they were still there . They did n't argue with pillows , for them it was usually letting their mind drift to this world where they were with their girlfriend all the time and no one could separate them for any reason . At some point they would come back down to reality , back to disappointment , and when people would ask if they were okay they would just avoid or dismiss the question . As they had just done .
Elise sighed as they scanned the textbook for their next problem . `` You and Elsa , I swear . You 've both been really out of it lately . ''
That got their attention in a hurry . Of all the times they talked together on the phone , they had never picked up any signs for worry . `` Uh wh-what do you mean ? What 's wrong with Elsa ? ''
`` She 's fine ... ish . I mean I can hear them sometimes in their room just like arguing with someone . Have you two been fighting lately ? ''
Anna felt like they had been hit in the chest by a frigid blast of ice . It was an oddly specific feelling , they hated experiencing it , and it only occurred when Elsa was somehow related .
`` Never ! They always sound fine on the phone . I never knew ... ''
Elise noted the look of concern on their friend 's face and put an arm around their shoulder . `` Hey I 'm sure it 's nothing . We 're sisters , we tell each other everything . If something was wrong I would know . ''
`` I guess but ... '' Anna sighed and looked down at the ground dejectedly . Maybe Elise was right and their sister was okay , but that still was n't enough of a consolation . They needed to see for themselves that Elsa was okay , or rather they just needed to see them
Them inexperience with relationships showed horribly in these kinds of situations . Was this much time apart good for them ? Was it normal ? Anna did n't know and that scared them more with each day that passed when they are n't with them The only bright side to this was that maybe , just maybe , Elsa was keeping it together . And if they could do it , then there was no reason Anna could n't .
But that still did n't change the fact that their need to see their girlfriend was bordering on codependency .
`` I think I know a way to cheer you both up , '' Elise said as they pulled out their phone .
Anna scooted closer but still kept their distance as to not pry too much into the blonde 's personal space . They would give anything just to not be so gloomy all the time . `` How ? ''
Elise turned and gave them an assuring grin . `` By cashing in that favor I owed you . ''
For a second Anna had no idea what they were talking about , but then they remembered that moment from the start of the semester . That fateful walk towards them now friend , and the favor they never expected or really required to be paid back at any point . After all , Elise had already paid it off in the best way by getting them closer to Elsa , and for being the catalyst for the start of their relationship .
`` And how are you gon na pay it ba- ''
`` Done ! '' Elise interrupted as they put away their phone . `` Now it 's your turn . ''
`` My turn ? What are you talking about ? ''
`` You need to text your parents . '' they replied , sounding more like a requirement than a suggestion . `` Say that you need them to pick you up at our house again . ''
`` What do you- '' It was then that Anna finally understood what Elise was trying to do . And with that realization came a smile bright enough to melt the ice from before . `` Oh my god . ''
`` You 're welcome . ''
Anna was so overwhelmed by this feeling of joy that they embraced Elise so hard they heard an audible sharp exhale . A feeling near unfamiliar to them at this point , weeks had passed since they last felt this way .
Finally . After waiting for so long , Anna was finally going to be able to see Elsa again . And they did n't care if they were together for thirty minutes or five , all that mattered was that they would be together again soon .
Now there was the matter of what they would say , and what they would do .
A/N : Ha see ? ! Elise totally has a purpose in this story other than just because I like the name Elise .
It would be impossible to name the craziest thing said by a Republican so far this year . This year ? This week .
New entrants arrive constantly and the competition is feral . And yet paradoxically they do n't even shock anymore . But one recent Republican remark should arrest you and deserves your contemplation : John Boehner 's statement on Face the Nation Sunday that they and their House Republicans “ ought to be judged on how many laws we repeal . ”
It 's not an outrageous statement in the Obama-wants-to-impose-Sharia vein , but in its way it 's more disturbing . The Republican Party now sees dysfunction as not just an unfortunate consequence of a set of historical factors , something that they might work every now and again to correct . Now , the Republican Party sees dysfunction as its mission .
This , I think you 'll agree , is new . Let 's put it more emphatically . It 's absolutely new in American history . Well , there exists some precedent back in the 1840s and '50s ( also led then by reactionaries who were mostly Southern ) . But in our modern history , let 's say , since we solved the problem of the peculiar institution and later became the world 's most powerful nation , we 've been a functioning democracy . There have been many moments of ugliness and sclerosis . But the particular qualities of the American system have generally produced what you could reasonably call governance .
From the start , we were not a parliamentary system , in which loyalty to the party is paramount and demanded . For a range of reasons , individual House members and especially senators have always had more autonomy than legislators in parliamentary systems do . This , along with the facts of our vast geography and diversity of interests , made our parties more flexible and ensured that cross-party ad-hoc coalitions could get laws passed .
We also had a tradition of legislative deference to the president—on foreign policy most of all , but also on domestic issues to some extent . A president 's top few priorities were always given a hearing , and compromise was usually reached . Tip O'Neill did n't share Ronald Reagan 's priorities by a long shot , but they saw that Reagan won handily and they did n't use the Rules Committee or any other trick to prevent the new president from enacting their agenda , though of course they did try to alter it . Even Newt Gingrich , after passing as much of their agenda as they could , sat down and talked turkey with Bill Clinton on a range of issues and struck a deal on Social Security and the budget .
I reread the above two paragraphs and I see that I sound a bit like a textbook , and a quaint one at that , one printed long ago . Certainly , the words and sentiments are irrelevant to most of the GOP members of the House . They really do n't care about any of those things . Consider this fascinating , and morbid , little fact : of the 230-odd Republican House members , fully half , 115 , have served since only 2010 or 2012 . They did n't come to pass legislation . They came to burn the place down .
Boehner is handing them their trusty Bic lighter . Yes , a man wants to hold on to their job , I understand that . And yes , a speaker should n't necessarily tip their hand on how they feel about an issue—immigration , say—until later in the process . But is Boehner being canny , or a coward ? Virtually everything Boehner says publicly is designed to placate the pyromaniacs . And if he 's ever said anything behind closed doors designed to challenge them , they 've kept it an awfully good secret ( which would not happen ; it would be leaked within seconds to ensure that they felt the lash of the Tea Partying millions ) .
They have brought us to a place we 've never been before : post-governance America . Oh , they have to pass some bills to keep Social Security checks going out , defense contractors being paid , that sort of thing . But passing the minimal number of bills needed to keep the economy from crashing to Middle Earth is n't the same thing as legislating . Or compromising . Those , they wo n't do . As Jonathan Chait notes this week , their “ negotiating ” position with Obama is this : We 'll raise the debt ceiling for the rest of your term . All you have to do is sign the Ryan budget into law and privatize Medicare . Right .
I do n't see any way out of this . We are stuck here for years . In all likelihood , because of the 2010 gerrymandering , the Republicans are going to control the House at least until 2021 . That 's eight . More . Years . And Boehner , let us not forget , is the “ moderate ” among those in the leadership . Say they let an immigration vote happen and pisses off back to Cincinnati ( Cincinnati ? What am I saying ? He 'll become a corporate lobbyist and buy a nice house in Leesburg . ) Then we get Speaker Eric Cantor , or Speaker Paul Ryan . I have trouble envisioning what “ worse ” could be , but it would most certainly get worse under either of those two .
This is n't a partisan crisis . It 's a historical crisis . And the political system ca n't solve it . We need leaders from other walks of life , especially from the various branches of the business world , to stand up and say to the Republicans that dysfunction can not be your mission . You must govern . Govern conservatively , but govern . And we need , as I 've said before , big-dollar organizations that can boot some of these people out of office and replace them with a few Dick Lugars . We do n't need to repeal any laws . Repealing a hundred or so people is what we need .
For several months I have been telling friends , colleagues and everyone who will listen to me that there is no way Donald Trump , a ridiculous bigot with a face like a Christmas ham , could ever secure the nomination for president of one of the two major American political parties . It has pained me considerably to discover that I was wrong .
Republicans have a number of bad ideas , I said ( on and on – and on – I went ) , but they could n't possibly take seriously a figure as fundamentally unserious as Trump , who barely advertised at all and simply relied on a tidal wave of bemused , then disturbed , then horrified media coverage to promote what appeared to be a complete joke of a presidential campaign without the least hint of a workable idea on anything .

What will Trump do about illegal immigrants ? He 'll build a wall . How will they pay for the wall ? He 'll make Mexico pay for it . How will they deal with the Affordable Care Act ? He 'll repeal it , personally , somehow . What will they replace it with ? “ Something terrific. ” ( That 's a direct quote . )
It feels like we 're all on a canceled television show given a few more episodes to wrap things up : all the good writers have found work elsewhere , leaving the hacks to produce the stupidest possible version of the political process , with guest stars from eight seasons ago ( Clinton , and Jeb Bush ) , absurd , two-dimensional villains ( Ted Cruz ) and utterly implausible caricatures of reality TV-star self-regard and incompetence in Sarah Palin and Donald Trump .
Trump 's cartoonishly awful , unworkable positions ( ban Muslims ! ) are so obviously the obnoxious posturing of a guy who has no intention of doing anything at all that it feels insane to learn that people have been taken in by it . What is there to be taken in by ? In a lot of ways , if the last few months had turned out to be a cruel , demented gag at my personal expense , that would be much preferable to the reality .
Trump 's campaign has been xenophobic and hateful on a surprisingly effective and fundamental level , which is why they are a better crooked entertainer than a crooked business person . At base , they are more like one of their supporters than most politicians are , especially in their relationship to what people often call “ dog-whistle racism ” . Trump is unique in their ability to not merely sound the dog-whistle but to hear it himself ; to modulate its tone and tune so that it plays a more complicated version that is unusually available to anyone who wants to listen . If you hate someone beyond reason , you will find that Donald Trump is playing your song .
And thus the tragedy of Trump is that they actually are not a power-mad dictator hellbent on the acquisition of authority to dominate the downtrodden and the different to suit their own cruel vision of the world . They have no vision or imagination , no master plan . The reason they seem to be making up policy as they go along is because that 's what he 's doing ; he 's simply telling gleefully ill-informed people like themselves what they want to hear .
Trump just proved : it 's possible to win a debate you did n't attend | Richard Wolffe Read more
Trump has been the dirty mirror of the American mind for decades ; their whole enterprise on NBC built up to the act of telling people more famous , wealthy and attractive than the viewer that they 're fired , and if they looked like a goblin while doing it , so much the better .
American life can be very hard , and hardship often makes people angry , bitter and eager for conflict . George Orwell observed in their review of Mein Kampf that the book 's appeal was in its pandering to that eagerness . “ Hitler , because in their own joyless mind they feel it with exceptional strength , knows that human beings do n't only want comfort , safety , short working-hours , hygiene , birth-control and , in general , common sense , ” they wrote , “ they also , at least intermittently , want struggle and self-sacrifice , not to mention drums , flags and loyalty-parades . ”
Now , after a recession that permanently altered the economy , unthinkable levels of drug addiction and horrifying increases in clinical depression so severe they led to a suicide epidemic , there is an enormous faction in American politics willing to blame someone – anyone – for how awful and unfair their lives have become , and to attack those people , whoever they are . And that faction thinks Trump ought to be president .
Perhaps their supporters , in the absence of a true fascist who hates the particular people they hate enough to hurt them , do not worship Trump or think they understand how to legislate or govern .
Perhaps they are merely content to settle for him , for the moment .
The Vitals
Birth Name : Michael Vogel
Nickname / Desired Superhero Name : Bitcoin Brothers ( along with my brother Dominic , of course )
Hometown : Vancouver
Company Name : Netcoins
Founding Year : 2014
The Story
What 's your professional background ? Have you always been an entrepreneur or have you paid your dues working for “ The Man ” too ?
My background is in electronics engineering . Prior to starting Netcoins , I worked for many years as an engineer at several great companies , developing and launching hardware products . Telecommunications , Internet-of-Things , smart-homes , and automotive are among my specialties . Most recently I was the manager of an electronics engineering team .
What inspired you to become an entrepreneur and go out on your own ?
Working for a startup ( as opposed to founding one ) is a great way to be exposed to all the tools it takes to become an entrepreneur . I was fortunate to begin my engineering career by working at a small startup , working alongside senior engineers who really took me under their wings . This was a fantastic environment to learn by osmosis .
How did you find the time , money and people to get your business off the ground ?
I often recommend that entrepreneurs ( especially first-timers ) should find an accelerator . I ca n't emphasize this enough . Through Spring U in Vancouver , I 've been able to surround myself with wonderful mentors and like-minded entrepreneurs . This has been a terrific way to “ inject ” ourselves into the startup community . Learning and sharing experiences with others building their own startups is crucial to finding your own success .
In terms of resources to start the company , I spent a considerable amount of time ( more than a year ) of evenings and weekends working on Netcoins while still working during the day in my regular job . My brother Dominic ( and Netcoins co-founder ) has a background in cyber-security in the banking sector , so we made a good pair to start a Bitcoin company .
What is your company all about and why should everyone care ?
Netcoins makes it easy for consumers to buy Bitcoin in-person at our retail Bitcoin ATMs . Digital currency is an amazing revolution that is re-inventing the world of money ( much like how email re-invented the postal industry ) . Although Bitcoin is exploding in popularity , it remains remarkably difficult for consumers to buy Bitcoins , which is where Netcoins comes in . We 've created a “ virtual ” Bitcoin ATM that turns any device ( iPad , computer , etc . ) into a software-based Bitcoin ATM . This means that stores do n't need to devote floor space ( or machine costs ) to a physical ATM machine . If you visit our homepage ( goNetcoins.com ) , you can find a location near you , or if you are a store owner , you can join for free .
Where do you hope to see your company 5 years from now ? What are you going to do to make it happen ?
Netcoins is actively launching in a number of countries , including Canada , Australia , UK , Ireland and USA . In 5 years we 'd like to serve as a preferred method for consumers to purchase Bitcoins in retail stores . Things are happening really quickly for us – we have a number of retail partnerships in place that are helping us scale rapidly . Gateway Newstands and Payment Source ( both based out of Toronto ) have both been early adopters for us .
In 5 years the Bitcoin landscape will be much different , and there will be a lot of services that rely heavily on Bitcoin 's global infrastructure . Last month Netcoins announced a partnership with XapCash , an international remittance company . Our partnership enables XapCash customers to visit a Netcoins location and transmit their local currency internationally at an ultra-low cost . Bitcoin allows us to move money instantly around the world in the back-end , while customers still use regular currency in the stores ( USD to Mexican Peso , for example ) .
What has been your favorite part of founding and growing your business ?
I started Netcoins because I wanted to find an easier way to buy Bitcoin . One of the coolest things about building a business from this mindset is that you will gain clarity as an entrepreneur much more rapidly if you are designing a product that you will want to use yourself .
What has been the most frustrating part of founding and growing your business ?
“ Work on the business , not in the business ” is an important principle when building a startup . Henry David Thoreau has a good quote : “ It is not enough to be busy . So are the ants . The question is : What are we busy about ? ” . In other words , while it is easy to get caught up in the minuscule details when building a startup , make sure you maximize your time and attention spent on the tasks that help bring your company closer to its overarching goal .
What do you do to keep yourself balanced and sane ?
I 'm interested too many things , and ironically found that I had to cut back on hobbies and other projects in order to maintain sanity ! Probably my biggest non-technical hobby is playing piano and guitar .
If you could be doing one other thing full-time , what would it be ?
I admire the contributions of startups in the medical technology sector . I 'm trained and certified to perform hemo-dialysis in order to assist my grandfather , and I would love to spend time developing technology in the biomedical field ( if you 'd like to learn more about dialysis , here 's my blog on the subject : DiscoverDialysis.com ) . If anyone out there is currently working on developing electronic devices with a medical application , feel free to reach out to me : [ email protected ] . I would be happy to volunteer my time as an adviser to your startup .
What 's your motto ? If you do n't have one , make it up right now…
“ Life is too short to make your own mistakes ” . Simply put : find good mentors .
Nigel Wray gazes out across their pristine , mud-free artificial pitch in Hendon and , not for the first time in almost two decades as chairperson of Saracens , ponders the future of professional rugby union .
`` Nobody in their right mind would be in this game to make a profit , '' they say flatly . `` You 're in it to do something really special at the weekend . If your ambition is to finish 10th and you 're losing money , what 's the point ? ''
It is a fair question , and one that cuts to the heart of the struggle for the soul of European club and provincial rugby . Without generous benefactors like Wray there would be no vibrant , ambitious clubs in England ; without underdogs like Connacht , who face Saracens at Allianz Park on Saturday in what could be their final appearance in an elite pan-European tournament , there would be less romance . Something , not for the first time in rugby 's eventful modern history , has to give .
Which is why this weekend feels less like the last round of pool matches than the end of rugby 's age of innocence . Talk to Wray and they will tell you the row over who runs the Heineken Cup is essentially an irrelevance . What really matters is what television 's grand masters want to broadcast and how much they are prepared to pay . `` Whether we like it or not I think rugby will go the same way as football without the noughts . Sport is about television , that 's the reality . What television wants , that 's what goes . And TV wants big games and big competitions . ''
For this simple reason , Wray reckons the Heineken Cup will shortly leap from its supposed death bed , albeit as a 20-team tournament under different flight attendantship on a rival network . They admit it would be `` a tragedy '' if the competition were lost , which will strike some Celtic observers as deeply ironic . Wray , though , can not understand why the neighbours think the English want to run off with everyone 's family silver .
`` It 's not that we 're marvellous . We 're not . It 's just that there are n't that many people with disposable income who live in Ireland , Scotland and Wales . Ask the TV companies . The money they pay is for the 60 million eyeballs in England . That 's why the Irish , the Welsh , the Scots and the Italians need England and France . ''
Wray knows all these arguments by heart . They have been in the vanguard of professional club rugby for 18 years and poured in an estimated £40m of their own money . When people talk about rapacious club owners seeking to line their pockets they forget the flip side . `` We all know Premiership rugby loses a lot of money collectively every year , '' Wray says . `` It must be £20m-30m a year . I 'm guessing because people will never tell you the truth . ''
As they freely admit , this can not be indefinitely sustainable . `` When I go , what happens ? My family might well say : 'We do n't want to do this every year . ' '' Hence their keen interest in this week 's vastly improved French Top 14 deal with Canal+ worth £60m a year . `` Clearly the deal they 've done must change things because it shows what the rights are worth . My personal view is that TV companies – and there 'll be others coming in like Google – will have to pay a lot more . In return we 've got to make the game a lot more attractive for them . ''
If the leading French clubs have even more money to splash around on players ' salaries , where does that leave Europe 's poorer relations ? Wray is adamant the customer will ultimately decide . `` He is n't turning up to watch certain games because he 's not interested . They want matches with real bite . When we played in the Amlin and went out to Bucharest we played in front of the same 300 people year after year . Where is the development taking place ? We were losing a fortune going there and risking players on rubbish pitches . Something has to change . ''
The International Rugby Board , however , need not panic . Wray foresees South African sides playing competitive games in the northern hemisphere in 10 years ' time but is not interested in cat-stroking , global domination of the entire sport . `` If you think I want another headache from running the international game as well as helping to run club sides , forget it . It 's a complete nonsense . We 're just at the end of the era in which the unions used to tell the clubs what to do . It 's the last ebbings of the landlord/serf relationship .
`` What other trade is there where you have to get a federation 's permission to get an order from Cardiff as opposed to Macclesfield ? It 's a complete joke . ''
Meritocratic European qualification for a team like Connacht via the RaboDirect Pro 12 is hardly radical . `` This is not aimed at any particular side but you 've got to qualify . You ca n't just stroll in . ''
There is another ticking issue , though , that may yet overtake all the European squabbling . No compensation package to cover the disruption to the club season during the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England has been finalised and Wray is far from happy . `` How on earth can the Rugby Football Union have signed a contract to effectively close down the clubs for two months without the clubs agreeing or being party to the contract ? Who 's going to pay the bills and wages for two months ? ''
The RFU and Premiership Rugby insist negotiations are continuing but Wray warns the clubs may have to consider drastic action . `` If you 've got a gun and you 're not prepared to fire it , you have n't got a gun , '' they say bluntly , when asked if withholding players might be an option . `` We do n't want to do that but we 're being put in a very difficult position . If we say we 'll release all the players , the RFU would say : 'Great , we do n't have to do anything . ' We should n't be being put in that position . It 's wrong . ''
Wray also argues `` the RFU has got to pay a lot more '' to compensate clubs for the use of their leading players . `` The professional guys there are not idiots . They understand the commercial pressures and understand they ca n't tell us what to do . '' They are equally convinced central contracts would be `` a disaster for players '' because they would have just one potential employer with a monopoly . At heart , though , they are a fan who simply yearns to see their beloved Sarries in the last eight , irrespective of Euro politics .
`` It 's only rugby and sport where this rubbish goes on . It should have been sorted out ages ago . '' Few would argue with them on that score .
U.S. State Department press briefing transcript :
( Starts at 12:00 )
DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON MARK TONER : Please , go ahead , Said .
QUESTION : Change topic ? Saudi Arabia .
MR TONER : Saudi Arabia .
QUESTION : Yesterday , Saudi Arabia was named to head the Human Rights Council , and today I think they announced they are about to behead a 21-year-old Shia activist named Muhammed al-Nimr . Are you aware of that ?
MR TONER : I 'm not aware of the trial that you – or the verdict – death sentence .

QUESTION : Well , apparently , they were arrested when was 17-years-old and kept in juvenile detention , then moved on . And now , he 's been scheduled to be executed .
MR TONER : Right . I mean , we 've talked about our concerns about some of the capital punishment cases in Saudi Arabia in our Human Rights Report , but I do n't have any more to add to it .
QUESTION : So you --
QUESTION : Well , how about a reaction to them heading the council ?
MR TONER : Again , I do n't have any comment , do n't have any reaction to it . I mean , frankly , it 's – we would welcome it . We 're close allies . If we --
QUESTION : Do you think that they 're an appropriate choice given – I mean , how many pages is – does Saudi Arabia get in the Human Rights Report annually ?
MR TONER : I ca n't give that off the top of my head , Matt .
QUESTION : I ca n't either , but let 's just say that there 's a lot to write about Saudi Arabia and human rights in that report . I 'm just wondering if you that it 's appropriate for them to have a leadership position .
MR TONER : We have a strong dialogue , obviously a partnership with Saudi Arabia that spans , obviously , many issues . We talk about human rights concerns with them . As to this leadership role , we hope that it 's an occasion for them to look at human rights around the world but also within their own borders .
QUESTION : But you said that you welcome them in this position . Is it based on improved record ? I mean , can you show or point to anything where there is a sort of stark improvement in their human rights record ?
MR TONER : I mean , we have an ongoing discussion with them about all these human rights issues , like we do with every country . We make our concerns clear when we do have concerns , but that dialogue continues . But I do n't have anything to point to in terms of progress .
QUESTION : Would you welcome as a – would you welcome a decision to commute the sentence of this young man ?
MR TONER : Again , I 'm not aware of the case , so it 's hard for me to comment on it other than that we believe that any kind of verdict like that should come at the end of a legal process that is just and in accordance with international legal standards .
When the the Marines currently stacked up in Afghanistan 's Helmand province waiting for a long-planned offensive against the Taliban finally make their move , they 'll be coming with a powerful new weapon that looks like a cross between a tank and hell 's own backhoe .
The Assault Breacher Vehicle , or ABV , has been in the works since the late 1990s , and it combines the brawn of an Abram 's tank and its 1,500 horsepower engine with a specially designed 15-foot wide plow to safely clear the minefields and improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) that the Taliban have laid around Marjah in preparation for the assault . The heavily armored breacher barely shudders when a typical mine detonates on its plow , and when the plow is n't sufficient for the job , the breachers also carry over 5,000 pounds of specially designed explosives that can be fired into mine fields and safely detonate their deadly contents at a distance .
The behmoths were first rolled into combat service in December , but Marjah promises to be the stiffest challenge yet for a platform that the Marines hope is the latest answer to the mines and other hidden explosives that have proved the greatest dangers to infantry in both Afghanistan and Iraq . In particular , it 's expected that they 'll reduce the need for combat engineers to make their way into mine fields and set clearing charges by hand .
The $ 3.75 million machines are so valuable at this point that they are n't operated outside of bases unless an even more powerful tank recovery vehicle – aka a big tow truck – is n't along to drag home the 70-ton breacher if anything goes wrong .
The main body of the breacher is built on the General Dynamics chassis that is used for the Abrams , with Pearson Engineering of the UK providing the specially designed plow and the other mine-clearing accessories that the Marines are looking forward to using in Helmand .

Marco Fioretti shows you how to use the open source program Inkscape to automatically generate or modify vector graphics .
Vector graphics are digital images that , unlike what happens with digital photographs , can be redrawn or rescaled at any size without any loss of quality . The reason why , to put it simply , is that such graphics do n't contain low-level lists of colored points ( pixels ) but computer instructions on how to draw each of their geometric elements . The most popular Free Software editor for vector graphics is the cross-platform Inkscape .
I have already shown , here on TechRepublic , how to insert interactive vector charts in your Web pages . This time , I 'll introduce some general methods to automate generation or modification of images of the same kind with Inkscape and a bit of scripting . If you need more details on specific points , just ask for them in the comments , and I 'll devote another post to them .
Why would you want to learn something like this ? Well , because the techniques described here may save a lot of time and boring , repetitive work for anyone who has to :
save many vector graphics in different formats and/or at different sizes and resolutions ( e.g . one for Web publishing , one for printing business cards or brochures , and one for printing large posters )
create many , slightly different versions of the same base graphic , for personalized logos or banners
create sketches , containing all the objects of the final graphic , ready to be rearranged or completed manually without starting from scratch ( this may be useful to teachers using vector graphics as parts of personalized homework )
Let 's now see how all this can happen . Like many other good Free Software tools , Inkscape has a command line interface ( CLI ) . That way to use Inkscape may seem unnatural , but can make it much more usable ( by making you open the GUI only when it 's really needed ) even on very slow hardware . Some operations will work even on systems without any graphical desktop installed , that is , should you ever need it , on remote servers . In general , you can use the Inkscape CLI to convert graphics , modify them , or check their structure and properties . The complete list of options is available in the manual , or by typing inkscape —help at the command prompt .
# 1 Print or export to other formats
Need to print or convert automatically many Inkscape graphics at some specified resolution ? No problem ! Some combination of the Inkscape —export options , properly embedded in a Bash script loop will do the job :
1 for F in ` find . -type f -name `` * svg '' ` 2 do 3 BASE= ` basename $ F .svg ` 4 inkscape —export-area-drawing \ 5 —export-png= $ BASE.exported.png \ 6 —export-width=60 \ 7 —export-height=60 $ F 8 done
The Bash code above finds all the files with the .svg extension in the current directory ( and all its subdirectories ! ) . Line 3 puts its basename in the temporary variable $ BASE . Lines 4 to 7 are one single Inkscape invocation , that creates a PNG copy of the specified size , called $ BASE.exported.png , of the whole drawing contained in the original file . Should you need printing , instead , check out the -p option , which may be even piped to other programs .
# 2 Modify existing vector graphics with Inkscape verbs
Automatic export or format conversion of your drawings is good . Telling your computer to do the actual drawing , or at least many small , necessary but brainless edits is much better . In the Inkscape CLI , commands are associated to verbs . Pass to Inkscape the —verb-list switch to know which verbs it understands . Using verbs , creation of many variants of the same drawing is a snap , as shown in this popular example :
inkscape —select=path616 —verb ObjectFlipVertically —verb FileSave —verb FileClose violin_key_flipped.svg
This tells Inkscape ( see Figure A ) to flip vertically the violin key object inside the violin_key_flipped.svg file and then save it , with the same name .
Figure A
Of course , in order to tell Inkscape to modify something , you must know what its name is : if I had not told Inkscape to work on the object called path616 , nothing would have happened . There are two ways to get this information . One is to open the initial vector graphic with Inkscape , right-click on the object that should be later modified from the CLI , and select `` Properties '' . At the prompt or from shell scripts , instead , you should use the —query options of Inkscape . —query-all , for example , provides name , position , size and other information of all the objects that constitute a vector graphic :
[ marco @ polaris ~ ] $ inkscape —query-all violin_key.svg svg101,1.6352039,1.7660537,85.876586,157.44916 path616,5.1436469,22.91937,72.013421,116.11488 path615,1.6352039,1.7660537,85.876586,157.44916 ... ( rest of outputs snipped for brevity )
# 3 Generate slideshows from text
The cool , little known tool called InkSlide creates vector graphics slideshows , using a previously generated Inkscape template , from plain text input like this :
Slide Title ++++++++++++++++++ - first level bullet - second level bullet ...
# 4 Process SVG with shell scripts
Being just drawing instructions , vector graphic are mostly made of plain text :
[ marco @ polaris scripting_inkscape ] $ more violin_key_flipped.svg < ? xml version= '' 1.0 '' encoding= '' UTF-8 '' standalone= '' no '' ? > < ! — Created with Sodipodi ( `` http : //www.sodipodi.com/ '' ) — > < svg xmlns : dc= '' http : //purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ '' etc etc ...
Therefore , we can generalize what you just read in the previous paragraph . You can write your own scripts that , just like InkSlide , edit or combine text and/or files generated manually with Inkscape to produce other vector graphics . Of course , this method is more difficult than the others , but it also is much more flexible . Inkscape verbs , for example , can not use parameters . Such a limitation does n't exist if you process the graphics source code by yourself . Besides , this is something that you may even do manually , with any text editor , if you had to make little changes to a graphic in a hurry , when Inkscape is n't available . In practice , to learn how to do this from Inkscape , you should click on `` Edit- > XML Editor '' . In that window , you 'll be able to see how actions performed in the graphic interface change the XML source . This will teach you how your script should work to reproduce the same edits .
I 'll stop here for now , but if you want to know more , just ask . In the meantime , have a look at these tips for creating diagrams and at these to play with text inside vector graphics .

Twenty-eight-year-old interim White House Communications Director Hope Hicks will serve in the role on a permanent basis .
The longtime Trump aide is the fourth person to fill the position , replacing Anthony Scaramucci , who was fired in July after just 10 days on the job .
Ms Hicks has served as President Donald Trump 's strategic communications director and campaign press secretary .
The ex-Trump Organization employee is one of their most trusted aides .
As White House communications director they will be responsible for shaping the administration 's message - although in a less visible way than press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders .
The appointment of Ms Hicks - a former Ralph Lauren fashion model - comes after a summer of staff shake-ups at the White House .
Mr Scaramucci was fired after they raised eyebrows for calling a reporter to give a profanity-laced tirade against their own colleagues .
President Trump 's chief of staff , Reince Priebus , and spokesperson , Sean Spicer , both left their posts after Mr Scaramucci 's appointment .
General John Kelly , who replaced Mr Priebus , sacked Mr Scaramucci after they were sworn in .
Mike Dubke , who was first appointed as communications director , resigned in May .
Mr Spicer also filled in as communications director while the post was open over the summer .
Can Hicks hope to handle Trump ?
By Tara McKelvey , BBC White House correspondent
Reporters say mean things about Hope Hicks . They complain that she 's not qualified for the job , and they say she 's in over their head .
It 's true that they did not come from the Washington establishment or the political world . A former Ford model , they started working for Trump in 2015 .
Still , they have something valuable - the president 's trust . Among those in the West Wing , she 's the closest to Trump and knows how they want to achieve their goals .
That seems like a good background for someone who 's handling their communications strategy .
How will Hope Hicks handle Trump ?
A leaked memo published by the website Autoblog indicates bankrupt automaker Saab has abruptly suspended warranty coverage on all its vehicles in North America , though owners may not be left as high and dry as originally feared .
Saab is apparently suspending all new car , powertrain , emissions and parts warranties , along with recall campaigns , certified pre-owned coverage and no-charge maintenance programs effective immediately . There 's no word , however , on whether this is a permanent or a temporary issue based on the automaker 's current bankruptcy proceedings , though the memo suggests that owners `` keep receipts of all related warranty work done or services performed until further notice . ''
Whatever stock of brand new Saab cars remains on dealers ' lots is to be sold `` as is , '' like some dubious merchandise advertised on Craig 's List .
Fortunately , General Motors just released a statement on the matter that should assuage recent Saab owners ' fears : `` In the event Saab can not or will not fulfill its obligations to administer the warranty programs with its U.S. and Canadian dealers through Saab Cars North America or otherwise , General Motors will take necessary steps to ensure that remaining warranty obligations on Saab vehicles marketed by GM in the United States and Canada will be honored . ''
UPDATE : Consumer Reports ' website clarifies GM 's position with regard to Saab warranties , saying the company will honor them only for cars built before Jan. 1 , 2010 , which includes mainly Saab 9-3s , but not new redesigned 9-5s or 9-4Xs . Saab owners with models that fall within the applicable warranty period will be treated as creditors under Saab 's bankruptcy proceeding , and could be offered some coverage from Saab 's assets once they 're sold . Personally , we would n't be holding our breaths over the possibility of that happening , neither would we consider buying a new `` as is '' Saab without warranty coverage , no matter how attractive any `` fire sale '' prices may subsequently become .
Here 's a link to a photocopy of the leaked memo via Autoblog .

Joe Takagi enjoyed a successful career leading Nakatomi Trading , which had built its U.S. headquarters in Los Angeles , in the film `` Die Hard . '' Google Images A year and a half into Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's tenure , results about their bold attempt to revive Japan 's moribund economy remain inconclusive . Last week , the FT literally asked whether Abenomics was failing . While Japan 's labor market has strengthened , firms have mostly been creating lower-wage jobs , and economic growth has begun to tail off .
It 's thus almost inconceivable that a wave of Japanese conglomerates would be able to snap up American corporate assets as investments .
But in the 1980s , it was a fact of life .
Starting with a relative trickle at the beginning of that decade , Japanese corporations went on an epic buying spree in America during the latter half of the decade after both countries agreed to revalue their currencies .
The trend became so widespread that the `` Japanese takeover '' theme began seeping into American culture .
Via Google News , we now take you on a tour of this singular moment in the life of both countries .
Explosions hit offices of the pro-Kurdish People 's Democracy Party ( HDP ) in Turkey on Monday , injuring six people , in the latest in a wave of attacks against the party .
Two local headquarters in the provinces of Mardin and Ardana were hit by explosions , according to the Dogan News Agency , leaving four injured .
The attacks come just three weeks before a general election in which the HDP aims to take enough seats to block ruling party the AKP from changing the constitution .
Rahmi Bastug , Mersin 's police chief , was quoted by Anadolu Agency as saying the explosion occurred in the kitchen of the HDP office .
The explosions are just the latest in a spate of up to 56 attacks against HDP offices in the Turkey over the last month .
Attacks have included attempts to target 16 election bureaus . In the upcoming election , HDP aims to become a leading opposition party based on its Kurdish support base , while also reaching out to non-Kurdish left-wing voters .
Last week , a group of around 50 people attempted to storm an HDP bureau in Bartin in northern Turkey leading to the injury of a police officer .
On Saturday , another HDP election office in the Saray district of Tekirdağ province was surrounded and pelted with rocks by anti-Kurdish demonstrators .
According to the Firat News Agency ( ANF ) , a pro-Kurdish news agency , a district administrator from the ruling Justice and Development party ( AKP ) was involved in the demonstrations .

HDP co-chairperson Selahattin Demirtas was set to hold a rally in Mersin today – it is unknown as of yet whether this will still go ahead .
In April , unidentified assailants opened fire on the HDP headquarters in the capital Ankara , though no casualties were reported .
Though often labelled a Kurdish party , the HDP has frequently argued that it can function as a party for all Turks and has pushed a left-wing programme focusing on workers ' rights , direct democracy and the rights of women and LGBT people , for whom it has a respective 50 percent and 10 percent quota for parliamentary candidates .
However , the party has been criticised for its alleged links to the illegal Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) which has been responsible for thousands of deaths in Turkey .
Turkish far-right organisations , such as the ultra-nationalist paramilitary Grey Wolves , have frequently been blamed for attacks on HDP supporters and offices .
The PKK link has also brought the party 's supporters into conflict with conservative currents in the Kurdish movement , as well as supporters of the Islamic State ( IS ) .
Clashes between liberal-leftist Kurds , security forces and the pro-IS Kurdish movement Huda Par ( and their Turkish Hezbollah military wing ) on the streets of Turkey have been responsible for scores of deaths over the past year .
Members of the Koma Civakên Kurdistan ( KCK ) , a transnational body set up by the PKK to organise political activity across the Kurdistan regions , urged their Turkish supporters on Saturday to vote for the HDP in the upcoming elections on 7 June .
`` As the AKP Government and Erdoğan are in a panic they are attacking the HDP , '' said KCK health committee member Necip Özalp , according to ANF . `` Our people must analyse these policies and support the HDP . They must not permit irregularities on the day of the election .
`` This year 's election is a matter of humanity . ”
Success for HDP could dent threaten attempts by the AKP to reach a majority in the 550-seater parliament if the HDP can pass the 10 percent quota needed to enter the chamber .
Both the HDP and the AKP draw support from Turkey 's Kurdish minority - who make up over a 20 percent of the country - due to the recent introduction of limited linguistic and cultural protections after decades of suppression .
Steve Bannon is making headlines — but not where you might think .
The White House Chief strategist and former Breitbart chairperson took front page billing — above the fold — in a recent edition of Al Masra . The newspaper is aligned with the terrorist organization Al-Qaeda .
Far from an excoriation , the publication came out in support of Bannon 's view that Islam and western civilization were locked in an existential conflict and cited what they said was Bannon 's belief that “ the forces of Islam can not be stopped by peaceful means . ”
“ The fact that [ Al Masra ] would put this so prominently on the front page—as lead article—indicates it has traction , that this is a way to win support. ” Elisabeth Kendall a University of Oxford senior research fellow of Arabic and Islamic studies told Quartz . “ It plays entirely into their narrative that they were right about the West 's war on Islam all along . ”

Until now , the Boxee that we 've known and tweaked was , at heart , an alpha-level geek toy—technically savvy , but funky to actually use . The just-released beta version makes TV , movies , Netflix , and other web content actually easy to enjoy .

We got a look at some screenshots and video from the unveiling , but we 've been able to use early release versions of the Boxee beta on both Linux and Windows systems since then . Here 's Howcast 's helpful video , showing off some features and offering tips on getting started

How To Get Started With Boxee on Howcast
And here 's what 's jumped out at us about this nifty little piece of software .
Click on any of the images in this post for a larger view .
Smoother playback and streaming , at least on Windows
Boxee is meant to be used on a media-minded , HDMI-connected mini-computer ( a.k.a . a `` Home Theater PC , '' or HTPC ) , or perhaps a laptop hooked up to an HDTV . There 's a dedicated device , the Boxee Box coming in 2010 for `` under $ 200 . '' The Boxee team has also recommended a few devices that are small , relatively cheap , and utilize the NVIDIA ION graphics chip to provide HD-quality video without requiring other high-end hardware .

I 'd already built a cheap-but-powerful Boxee setup , but for the beta release , I switched that ASRock Ion 330 to a Windows 7 installation , with Boxee set to load on startup . I did that because Windows is the main platform where Adobe `` Labs '' Flash 10.1 offers 3D acceleration for Hulu and other web video streams—although the Boxee Box will see accelerated Flash as well . It 's also the best big-picture platform because Netflix requires Microsoft 's Silverlight software to stream—not available , as you might guess , for Linux .

Running the Boxee beta on Windows 7 , I 've been very , very pleased with both downloaded video files and streaming content . Watching Hulu or other decently-high-quality video is akin to watching standard definition television , while streaming HD videos from Vimeo or YouTube feels like living in the future . Adobe will eventually ( we 'd hope ) add hardware acceleration to its Mac and Linux Flash players , and Netflix may well make its way onto Linux systems . For the time being , though , the specially built Boxee Box or a Windows setup seem like the road to high-definition happiness .
Focus on content , not sites
In the Boxee alpha , when you wanted to watch a movie on Netflix , you launched the Netflix button , then navigated through that app 's own interface to pick a movie or TV episode . When you were looking for a TV show , you 'd head to the TV menu , pick the CBS , WB , or Hulu Feeds button ( when it worked ) , then click-click-click to your show , and your episode .

Now when I want to check out that season finale episode of Glee I 've been meaning to get around to ( forever ) , I can head to TV Shows , start typing in G-L , and select it from the as-you-type results on the right . Boxee will ask if I want to stream this episode through Fox 's own site or Hulu , let me know if they 're ad-supported or not , and give me the alternate option of queuing this episode up , if I 'm not ready for the sit-down yet .

It works this way for movies , too . Start typing in H-A-N , and if you wanted to stream Hancock over Netflix , head over and click on it . If you 're on a laptop , or using Boxee 's kinda awesome QWERTY remote in the future , it 's easy , and clicking out two letters on a virtual keyboard is n't so bad with a standard remote , either .
The very handy Queue

Boxee 's Queue feature makes this find-and-click process even easier . If I 've added Glee to My Shows , it will automatically show up in my Queue , the right-most column on the start screen . If I happened to see a link to the Hulu page for that episode in my web travels , I could queue it up with a bookmarklet . Or , if I 'm really into my serial musical dramedies , I could add Glee to the ever-present pop-up menu . When you get to Glee 's page , the episodes you 've already watched through Boxee have dimmed titles , which is quite helpful as well .
The Apps and social hooks
If Boxee did nothing but play back your video files and hook up to Netflix or Hulu , it would be , well , XBMC Live , or just an open-source Windows Media Center . What differentiates Boxee is its support for independent app development , giving all kinds of niche , mashup , and just plain cool sites a home on your TV .

There are too many to try and name or catalog here in total , but in my own house , the Facebook and Flickr photo apps have become a relaxing way of keeping up on what friends are up to . Failblog and The Daily Kitten 's apps provide shamelessly effective quick-hit entertainment , and I watched the entirety of The Guild 's third season through Boxee on my TV . If I 'm blogging from the living room , I can have Pandora piped through our speakers , or listen to NPR through its own app , or through the RadioTime tuner . As Boxee becomes more available and accessible to the average home , more apps are bound to come along .

And your friends , too , who get hooked up with Boxee will make the experience more enjoyable . Not that I do n't think the Boxee team lacks for cultural cachet , but they 're the only people , out of the 10 I 'm friended to through Boxee , that manage to push anything into my recommended/rated feed . When more of your friends and fellow media lovers start using it , you 're bound to enjoy bumping into little surprises on Boxee a whole lot more .
What 's still missing
So Boxee 's taken a big step toward making their software more content-focused and accessible , but they could go farther .

Hulu can remember where you left off in a video while you 're signed in , and it would be great if Boxee could do that , too—on any video site . This is n't some overnight JavaScript hack , but , still , it 's one of the last big differences between your DVD/Blu-Ray player and web video .
Video files that we download from around the internet have a huge variety of naming schemes . Jason 's detailed some techniques for helping the `` scraper '' in XBMC , and Boxee , recognize and organize your files in their guide to turbo-charging your XBMC installation , but more work on getting Boxee 's local file organizer to instantly locate and categorize TV shows and movies is always appreciated .
Boxee still includes an automatic torrent downloader , and a web-server-based remote control scheme , but they 're both tucked away deep in the system options . Why not come out of the server room ghetto and make Boxee a remote-controlled BitTorrent champion , just like uTorrent ?

Those are our ( admittedly positive-minded ) impressions so far . Once you 've had a chance to play around with the latest Boxee , tell us what you think in the comments .
Share . Is barrel rolling as good now as it was 14 years ago ? Is barrel rolling as good now as it was 14 years ago ?
It 's hard to believe 14 years have passed since Star Fox 64 first landed on the Nintendo 64 . Fast forward to today , and the title has leapt into the spotlight once more with its very own 3DS remake . But does Star Fox 64 3D live up to the original ? In short -- absolutely .
For those new to the series , Star Fox 64 3D offers a part flight simulation , part shooter adventure . You take control of Fox McCloud and , with the help of a host of memorable characters , shoot your way through a series of fast-paced levels to ultimately save the Lylat System from the evil Andross . The levels provide plenty of challenge , with some crazy and hyper strategic boss fights you 'll want to relive again and again . If you 've never played Star Fox before , now 's the perfect time to hop on the barrel-rolling bandwagon .
Just like in the original , the overworld of Star Fox 64 3D consists of a series of branching paths that unlock depending on which route you take in each level , which in part informs how the story unfolds . However , the 3DS version adds the ability to choose which of the available planets you want to go to next , rather than forcing you to go to the planet connected to the path you took . It 's a nice touch , and really freeing that you 're no longer committed to your original decision .
Exit Theatre Mode
The game itself controls beautifully , offering a couple of main options for players to choose from . You can opt for the 3DS controls , which means using the system 's gyroscope technology in addition to the circle pad to control the Arwing ( the star fighters piloted by team Star Fox ) by tilting the system . This works surprisingly well , except for the fact that you 'll have to turn the 3D off to prevent it from blurring all the time unless you 're able ( and willing ) to move your body along with the system . While this option works just fine , I honestly preferred the traditional controls . Using the circle pad makes for fast and fluid movement , and it 's great to not have to worry about messing up the 3D effect by moving the system .
Slippy 's back and froggier than ever !
The graphics in Star Fox 64 3D have undergone a complete overhaul from the ground up , and they 're absolutely gorgeous . The developers did away with the blocky polygonal shapes and rough edges of the original , making full use of the system 's hardware to create impressive environments with tons of detail . Water and particle effects are particularly impressive , highlighting how well the game 's aesthetics capture the essence of the original while simultaneously upgrading everything about it . The use of 3D is stunning . The added depth looks fantastic , and it 's pretty incredible barreling through space as meteors and lasers jump out at you . There 's no noticeable slowdown with the 3D turned on , so you can enjoy the brilliant graphics to their fullest even with the 3D slider pumped all the way up .
The only downside to this otherwise masterful remake lies in the half-baked multiplayer mode . Sure , battling your way through four different levels in an arena-styled fight with up to four players delivers some quality fun . But unless you 're fighting against the computer , it 's limited to only Download Play . It 's great that you only need one cartridge for four people to play together , but the absence of online play against your friends , or strangers , feels like a big miss . Still , the heart of Star Fox 64 multiplayer has always been rooted in local play , so while it 's a disappointing omission , it 's not the biggest deal in the world .
You can either battle for a set number of points , fight for a certain amount of time , or try to be the last plane flying . Newly added power-ups -- such as temporary invisibility or a position swap with the player closest to you -- contribute to the madness , but can be turned off if you want a more classic experience . The mode itself offers tons of fun -- you and your friends will roar with laughter and curse each other out pretty much the moment you begin , and the fact that you can see a live video of your buddies as you kick their butts ( or as they kick yours ) only adds to the silliness .
In kindergarten , Arizona students learn to spell simple , frequently used words , count by fives and so many other useful skills . At dozens of local neighborhood public schools throughout Arizona , many now also learn a second language through dual-language immersion programs .
“ Students learn the language very quickly when it is presented in an engaging and interesting way , ” said Mai-Lon Wong , Ed.D. , principal of Coronado Elementary School in Gilbert , which offers a Mandarin Choice dual-language immersion program for kindergarteners and first graders .
Since 2002 , students at Puente de Hózhó School in Flagstaff have been immersed in either the Navajo ( Diné ) or Spanish language and culture from the first day of kindergarten to their last day of fifth grade .
“ Our kids and our parents understand that it gives them a leg up , ” said Dawn Trubakoff , principal of the bilingual magnet school in Flagstaff Unified School District . “ In other countries , it 's nothing for kids to speak two , three or four languages . Here in America , that 's not a given . ”
Bonny and Scott Dolinsek 's son has been in Kyrene de los Ninos School ‘ s dual-language Spanish/English program for the past three years .
“ What we as parents appreciate most about the program is that we are giving our child a gift that will only benefit them and have positive life-long effects , ” Bonny said . “ Bilingualism will open their eyes to more opportunities with jobs , cultural experiences and life as a whole . We are so thrilled to know that our son is receiving a Kyrene education , all while learning a second language ! ”
Dual-language immersion programs have grown from a few hundred nationwide to nearly 1,000 in the past three years . In Arizona , there are more than 40 dual-language programs in public schools , and the number keeps growing .
This fall , Vail School District in Tucson is starting a Mandarin/English dual language immersion program for kindergarteners at Mesquite Elementary School after being approached by the Confucius Institute at the University of Arizona , said Natalie Luna Rose , communications specialist for the district .
“ As adults , because we do n't quite remember what it was like to be that age , we underestimate what they can do , ” Rose said . “ If we give them the opportunity they can do amazing things . ”
A team from Vail observed kindergarten students in a Spanish immersion program at a Cave Creek Unified school earlier this year , Rose said .
“ Their minds are just so ready to absorb and adapt , ” Rose said . “ When the teacher spoke to them in Spanish , a few of them struggled but they still were able to figure out what was going on , and there was no stress about it . They were excited and ready to learn . ”
Tuba City Unified School District in Coconino County is redesigning their Diné language immersion program for grades K-12 “ to replicate in every way possible in a school setting the language acquisition and proficiency as acquired in the home and family environment , ” said Adair Klopfenstein , Native American studies director for the district .
Tuba City Unified Superintendent Dr. Harold Begay is devoted to seeing the Navajo and Hopi languages and cultures thrive long into the future through district programs to “ embrace and incorporate community cultural values and wisdom , use indigenous languages and cultural knowledge to empower and promote harmonious concordant personal , social , and educational growth and engage and stimulate minds with traditional native cultural knowledge and wisdom , ” Klopfenstein said .
Learning a second language is important , because it teaches students persistence and a different way of problem-solving , Trubakoff said .
It also expands the number of people they can communicate with , since students can use English and Spanish to talk to people in 187 countries , said Luis Melo , fifth grade Spanish teacher at Puente de Hózhó .
“ The world 's no longer small , ” Rose said .
Learning a second language helps students develop creative and critical thinking , and helps the U.S. remain competitive in the global market , Rose said .
Coronado teachers understand the world is becoming increasingly global , and that schools need to prepare students today for the technologically advanced and internationally connected economy of the future , Wong said .
“ Knowing a second language will help prepare our students to be successful leaders in a global society , ” Wong said . “ Mandarin is the most useful language to conduct business in , second only to English . If you speak Mandarin and English , you can speak to 50 percent of the world 's population . That is a powerful tool to have at one 's disposal . ”
Dual-language programs also are a “ net pulling together families , ” Melo said .
“ Our kids learning Navajo are able to go back to the reservation and understand their siblings and grandparents living there who use Navajo only , by using the language they are learning here , ” Melo said . “ We have some teachers who do not know any Spanish , and they use their kids who go here to translate and interpret . ”
Tuba City Unified 's Navajo and Hopi language instructors appeal to students on many levels in order to engage them , encourage them and sustain students ' communication in their native language , Klopfenstein said .
“ We want this communication to spill over to the homes in the hogans , ” Klopfenstein said . “ Our parents and grandparents are overjoyed to hear their kids and grandkids expressing themselves in their native language and using language to communicate basic needs . ”
Puente de Hózhó provides an environment where different cultures are valued and there is a strong sense of community , Trubakoff said .
“ We enrich and learn from each other , ” Melo said .
Parents and students do n't have to be embarrassed if they do n't speak English well , because “ we 're all about teaching non-English speakers how to speak English and non-Spanish speakers how to speak Spanish , ” Trubakoff said .
Some Navajo parents have told Trubakoff they are grateful their children are learning Navajo in school , because many of the parents do not speak Navajo themselves .
“ We do n't try to fix any kids . If they do n't speak any English , we 're not fixing them , they 're not broken , ” Trubakoff said . “ They have this wonderful gift that half the class wants from them . They have a gift to give us . ”
Last year , Coronado Elementary with support from College Board and Arizona State University 's Confucius Institute offered an after-school Chinese Culture club , added Chinese culture to social studies classes and began Mandarin Chinese language instruction for kindergartners , Wong said .
“ They love singing the songs , counting and learning to write the language , ” Wong said . “ Even young children understand the power of speaking another language . ”
The Higley Unified School District plans to expand the program each year to offer a pre-kindergarten to high school early language option and currently offers Mandarin in middle and high school , Wong said .
“ Our parents appreciate the opportunity to have their children participate in a program that previously was reserved for only the elite private schools or international schools , ” Wong said . “ They are thrilled that their children have the potential to reach mastery of a foreign language that they can actually use at the professional level in the future . ”
Kyrene School District will expand its dual-language program from Kyrene de los Ninos in Tempe to Kyrene de los Lagos in south Ahwatukee and “ the principal and one of the teachers who started it all are going to lead the effort at Lagos , ” said Jeremy Calles , chief financial officer for the district .
Calles said the dual=language program has made a real difference at Kyrene de los Ninos .
“ Ninos was built to hold over 700 students , but only had 400 and out of our 25 schools it was the lowest performing school with a C , ” Calles said . “ Now it is a B school and well on it 's way to earning an A , it should be there within the next couple of years . Also it 's packed , the program has a waiting list and the spots fill up as soon as we open up Open Enrollment in January . The school will start the year with over 700 students . Increased enrollment and achievement , we could n't ask for anything more . ”
The dual-language program has brought families to Kyrene from all over the valley and there is still space available in Kindergarten at Kyrene de los Lagos in Ahwatukee , said Dolinsek , community relations specialist for the district .
“ There is also a program available for early learners , Bienvenidos , offered at two sites , Lagos and Norte , ” Dolinsek said . “ This program is to prepare the children for the Dual Language classroom during the elementary years . ”
For more info on this program and the dual language , please call 480-541-1000 .
Flagstaff parents are so interested in Puente de Hózhó 's program there is a long waiting list . In Vail 's program , the kindergarten class is full , but there might be some room in first grade and an open house for parents will be held July 10 . The Mandarin Choice program at Coronado Elementary is still taking applications for the fall .
In Flagstaff , parents and community members said they wanted children to learn Navajo and Spanish languages and culture , so the district 's director of bilingual education applied for and was awarded a Title VII grant for indigenous languages which funded the ( Navajo ) Diné/English and Spanish/English programs , Trubakoff said .
“ The program started out with kindergarteners , the next year we added first graders , then the next year second graders and we rolled it on up all the way through fifth grade , ” Trubakoff said .
In Puente de Hózhó School 's Diné/English program , 25 kindergartners and 25 first graders are immersed in Navajo language and culture , Trubakoff said . In second and third grade they spend half their time learning math and science in Navajo and half their time learning language arts and social studies in English . Then in fourth and fifth grade the students are mixed in with the students in the Spanish/English program .
In Tuba City Unified , students are immersed in Diné and Hopi that is aligned with the traditional learning model and the Dine Philosophy of Learning , use technology for digital storytelling and in their flipped learning classrooms , and take part in project/experiential learning , Klopfenstein said .
Flipped learning lessons introduce each week 's lessons and objectives , help reteach concepts , and also provide enrichment , Klopfenstein said . There is a minimum of one required flipped lesson per week required by each instructor .
“ This engagement of students in the language activities before they reach the classroom allows our instructors to facilitate instruction rather than revert back to traditional lecture style , ” Klopfenstein said .
Experiential/project-based learning gives teachers an opportunity to incorporate cultural teachings , crafts and skills into the curriculum such as weaving , moccasin making , basket making , traditional dancing , arts and crafts , ethnobotany and food preparation activities , Klopfenstein said .
In Puente de Hózhó School 's Spanish/English program , it 's a 50-50 dual-language program in which students learn math and science content in Spanish from a native Spanish-speaking teacher and language arts and social studies content in English from a native English-speaking teacher , Trubakoff said . All content is aligned with Arizona 's College and Career Ready Standards .
Vail and Higley 's Mandarin programs content instruction follows a similar format .
“ It 's amazing how quickly they switch from one language to another , including the pronunciation and intonation , ” Melo said . “ They do n't even think about it , but they do it automatically when they switch from one language to another . ”
Puente de Hózhó students also write essays in Spanish and English , and do science projects in Spanish and in Diné .
“ The dual language immersion model is the most effective and efficient way to teach a language , ” Wong said . “ It is the same natural and easy way that humans learn a language at a young age . Our kindergarteners learned it so quickly , they just think it is a game . ”
Research indicates that “ young children learning in two languages show increased brain activity when using the target language , ” and that “ bilingual brains are physically heavier than monolingual brains , ” Wong said .
Dual-language immersion students master Mandarin at a far higher level than students who start learning a foreign language in high school , Wong said .
“ Learning a second language at an early age , especially one as difficult as Mandarin Chinese will protect the child 's ability to sound like a native speaker , ” Wong said .
Even if less time is spent learning mathematics in the target language , dual-language students show the same or better achievement when compared with students who only speak one language , Wong noted .
Puente de Hózhó students ' AIMS scores are just as high or higher than those of the district , county and state , Trubakoff said .
“ We have a very high English Language Learner population , obviously a high Hispanic population and a high Native American population and we 're pretty high poverty as well , but our kids ( AIMS ) scores are great , ” Trubakoff said . “ That means they 're working hard and are able to connect it . ”
Violence
According to their relatives , Aakash , who has been stalking Indhuja for over a month , landed up outside their residence on Monday night .
In a shocking incident of an alleged stalker turning killer , a man in Chennai set a 22-year-old woman they were obsessing over on fire .
Aakash , who used to study with Indhuja , an engineering graduate , has been stalking them for over a month , claiming they were in love with her , alleged relatives . When Indhuja an engineering graduate did not respond , Aakash went to their house on Monday night and set them and their mother on fire , according to statements by their relatives .
The incident happened at Adambakkam AGS Colony , in Saraswathi Nagar , between 8.45pm and 9pm on Monday night . The accused , Aakash , absconded right after , but was caught on Tuesday morning .
According to reports , Aakash , who lives in the neighbourhood , landed up outside Indhuja 's residence on Monday night . Indhuja and their family were initially reluctant to open the door , but Aakash persisted , claiming they only wanted to speak to Indhuja for a few minutes .
They were then made to stand at the doorway , according to relatives of the family , and talk to Induja . But they soon broke out into an argument . Following this , they fetched the oil that they had hidden near the shoe rack outside the house and doused Induja with the oil . They allegedly then used a lighter to set them on fire . The rest of the oil spilled on to the ground and went up in flames as well .
Them mother Renuka and sister Nivedha who tried to save the victim , also suffered burn injuries and neighbours who rushed into the house on hearing their wails found them battling the fire that was burning into their clothes .
“ We found the mother and younger daughter and we brought them down . We switched off the power and again went up because the mother told us that their other daughter was inside . The whole house was covered in smoke , we opened windows and put water to stop the fire . When we went inside to one of the bedrooms , we found the elder daughter burnt and unconscious on the ground , ” says Raghu , a neighbour .
Indhuja succumbed to their injuries on Monday night and their body was shifted to the Kilpauk Medical College ( KMC ) hospital in the city . Them mother Renuka sustained 49 % burns , and sister Nivedha has 23 % burns . Both of them are critical , and getting treatment at KMC .
An engineering graduate , Indhuja had been scared of Aakash 's behaviour says relatives . They allege that they have been stalking them for a while and that the accused and victim were classmates in school .
Indhuja 's uncle told media persons , “ He 's been stalking them for a month . My brother went abroad for some work . Perhaps knowing this , this man came home last night . They did n't open the door . But they said they just wants to talk to them They then poured the petrol on the girl and the mother and burned them and ran away . ”
What do you get someone who has everything ? What do you get someone who works for Consumer Reports ? These questions are two sides of the same coin : no matter what you get , the recipient is likely to be disappointed .
Fortunately , I am neither of those things , but I am extremely difficult to shop for on account of knowing way too much about way too many consumer products .
In my original SS profile , I mentioned a kitchen severely lacking in quality tools . I subsequently updated my profile with my Amazon wishlist , and Santa ended up getting the two items that most need to be upgraded : a ladle and spaghetti server .
Now , you may think this is kind of a crappy/boring gift , but considering the recipient , it 's actually awesome compared to some of the other ~~glamorous~~ gifts this year . Kindle ? I mostly read academic papers and internet content . PS3 ? My roommate has one and I do n't really play console games . Gaming desktop ? I 've been laptop only since 2004 . Caribbean cruise ? Ca n't , got ta work on my PhD dissertation .
The gift is practical , it is needed , and it is appreciated . What more could you ask for ? Thanks Secret Santa ! ! !
I 've been reading about the peculiar metamorphosis of the starfish , Luidia sarsi , which eats shellfish and dwells in the muddy sediment of seashores from Norway to the Mediterranean . Its diaphanous larvae are bilaterally symmetrical ; the adult form , with its five arms , is radially symmetrical , a most irregular circumstance . Moreover , the adult emerges from the larva in a different way than the butterfly from the caterpillar , where the structure dissolves and reforms . The starfish develops from a cluster of cells lining the internal cavity of the larva . `` `` Here it grows and matures , an alien existence independent of the larval body structures , axis , bilateral symmetry , and form , imbued with a complete disregard for every embodiment of its larval stage . '' Eventually , the starfish emerges , and , most oddly , the larva continues on its way `` swimming the pelagic waters and grazing on its vegetarian diet of algae '' . Essentially , the starfish develops from what might be called stem cells that are carried within the larva . It 's all very alien , or perhaps even Alien .
The theory presented in Frank Ryan 's The Mysteries of Metamorphosis ( White River Junction , 2011 ) is that at one time the larva and the starfish were two different creatures ( from two different phyla ) . Somewhere in the dark backward and abyss of time , sperm from the one creature encountered an egg of the other ( both creatures eject enormous amounts of reproductive material into the sea ) and cross-phyletic cross-fertilization occurred and the resultant chimera prospered .
Biologists resist the hypothesis because of the challenge it poses to the standard view of the evolutionary branching of life . I 'm in no position to judge the theory 's truth or falsity , but I 'm attracted to the idea because it makes life forms so much more complex and unpredictable , and because it overturns conventional thinking .
Major League Soccer on Thursday announced the four players named to the AT & T MLS All-Star inactive roster , completing the 32-man selection for 2016 .
Vancouver Whitecaps goalkeeper David Ousted , Real Salt Lake goalkeeper Nick Rimando , Philadelphia Union forward C.J . Sapong and Portland Timbers playmaker Diego Valeri joined the 28 previously named players .
The 25-man active MLS All-Star roster will take on English Premier League giants Arsenal in the AT & T MLS All-Star Game at Avaya Stadium on Thursday night ( 7:30 pm ET ; ESPN and UniMas in the US , TSN2 and RDS in Canada ) .
This is the seventh-straight All-Star selection for Rimando , the second nod for Ousted and Valeri and the first career All-Star selection for Sapong .
Ousted has started all 22 of Vancouver 's regular season matches this year , posting an 8-8-6 record and registering a league-high 81 saves .
Rimando is 7-3-7 in 2016 , notching three shutouts and posting a 1.47 goals against average . The longtime MLS veteran is currently one win shy of tying Kevin Hartman for the all-time league record for wins and they are tied with Hartman for the all-time MLS record of 411 career regular season starts .
The 2011 MLS Rookie of the Year , Sapong has been solid for the Union this year , recording six goals and two assists in 18 appearances for Philadelphia . Valeri 's numbers are even better , with the Timbers star notching nine goals and five assists in just 18 regular season matches .
The league officially confirmed that Colorado Rapids midfielder Jermaine Jones ( undisclosed injury ) , Sporting Kansas City defender Matt Besler ( left MCL strain ) and Portland Timbers defender Liam Ridgewell ( calf strain ) will all miss Thursday 's All-Star Game against Arsenal due to injury .
All three players , none of whom played for their respective clubs last weekend , will be held out of their teams ' next matches due to a league rule that bars All-Stars from playing in their next league game if they ca n't participate in the All-Star Game .
Jones will be held out of Colorado 's match at New York City FC on Saturday ( 3 pm ET ; MLS LIVE ) , while Besler and Ridgewell will sit out Sunday 's game between SKC and Portland at Children 's Mercy Park ( 2 pm ET ; FOX in the US , MLS LIVE in Canada ) .

The protests in Bishkek were echoed in other Kyrgyz cities
By Rayhan Demytrie
BBC News , Bishkek
Scores of people lost their lives . More than 400 were injured . This is the day that changed the course of history in this small , mountainous former Soviet state . Five years ago Kyrgyzstan made headlines around the world when mass protests that became known as the Tulip Revolution brought to power a former opposition leader , Kurmanbek Bakiyev . There is a popular image from those days that shows Mr Bakiyev marching with other opposition figures , including Roza Otunbayeva . Now it is they who is heading an interim government of Kyrgyzstan . It all began on Tuesday in the north-western town of Talas , where the arrest of an opposition figure triggered mass protests . FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript . Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Thousands of demonstrators stormed a government building and imposed their own `` people 's governor '' . They demanded the resignation of Kurmanbek Bakiyev . Late on Tuesday , riot police sent from the capital , Bishkek , took over the building . But not for very long . In an unexpected turn of events the protesters re-took the building , by throwing stones and petrol bombs at the riot police . Portraits of President Bakiyev were set on fire . Later that day , the government announced the situation was under control . Many opposition leaders were detained . Ready for action April 7 was the date the opposition planned to have a nationwide rally . But no-one expected what the day would bring . The disturbances began in the city of Talas on Tuesday Hundreds of people started gathering in front of the opposition headquarters in Bishkek . Thousands gathered in other parts of the country . The people were ready for action . Protesters in Bishkek broke through a police cordon and marched towards the main government building - the White House . Several police cars were set on fire along the way . As the protesters approached the White House they were met with a fusillade of stun grenades and live rounds . Some were killed . On this rainy day , the puddles were coloured red with blood . A body of one young protester was lying on a marbled pavement . Angry crowds gathered next to it . `` I was walking past with my friend and they were shot in the back , '' one distraught young man said . Many more were shot dead or injured . 'Same mistakes ' Events were moving fast in Kyrgyzstan . The protesters stormed the national TV and radio company . They moved on to police headquarters , the general prosecutor 's office and the parliament building . A state of national emergency was declared by President Bakiyev and curfews imposed in the cities of Bishkek , Talas and Naryn . Later on Wednesday , opposition leaders arrested the day before were released . They set up an interim government , led by Roza Otunbayeva . In a comment to a Russian TV channel Ms Otunbayeva said the situation in the country remained tense and difficult . Russia 's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also commented on the Kyrgyz events - they said President Bakiyev had made the same mistakes as their predecessor when they were ousted in that popular uprising , five years ago .

A commercial Cygnus supply ship left the International Space Station on Monday after delivering more than 5,000 pounds of cargo and experiments , ready to start a week of standalone operations to include a groundbreaking microgravity fire experiment and deployment of four commercial weather-monitoring CubeSats in orbit .
The Orbital ATK-owned spacecraft was released from the station 's Canadian-built robotic arm at 8:22 a.m. EST ( 1322 GMT ) Monday , completing a 29-day stay at the research lab .
Astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Thomas Pesquet managed the departure procedures from a robotics work station inside the cupola module .
Three minutes later , the Cygnus spaceship fired thrusters to expedite its departure from the space station 's vicinity , and the cargo craft quickly faded from view of station-mounted cameras to become a dot backdropped by the blackness of space .
Astronauts replaced the supplies delivered inside the Cygnus spacecraft 's pressurized module with more than 2,469 pounds ( 1,120 kilograms ) of trash and other unneeded items , according to Orbital ATK .
Kimbrough radioed their thanks to NASA and Orbital ATK ground teams for the successful cargo delivery mission once Cygnus was safely away from the outpost .
“ ISS received more than 5,000 pounds of equipment , supplies and payloads , which put the station in great shape , ” Kimbrough said . “ It was an honor to work on this Cygnus flight , especially since it was dedicated to our colleague Alan Poindexter . From the Expedition 50 crew , thank you again to all the people who made this flight such a huge success . ”
Orbital ATK nicknamed the Cygnus spacecraft the S.S. Alan Poindexter after a former space shuttle pilot and commander who died in water sports accident in 2012 .
The Cygnus spacecraft launched Oct. 17 atop an Antares rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at Wallops Island , Virginia , and reached the station Oct. 23 . The launch marked the first flight of Orbital ATK 's upgraded Antares rocket , powered by new engines to replace the type blamed for a catastrophic launch failure moments after a liftoff in October 2014 .
Orbital ATK has at least 17 operational Cygnus missions on the books under contract to NASA , and Monday 's departure was the start of the final chapter of the sixth such flight .
Three more major tasks remain for the Cygnus spacecraft this week .
The supply ship was to begin raising its orbit later Monday to set up for the deployment of four commercial CubeSats later this week .
Soon after the first orbit-raising maneuver , around 1:30 p.m. EST ( 1830 GMT ) Monday , an innovative combustion experiment inside the Cygnus 's internal cabin will activate for an investigation into how flames grow and fuels burn in microgravity .
Ground controllers plan to switch on the Saffire 2 payload and ignite nine experimental samples inside a self-contained enclosure measuring 3 feet by 3 feet by 5 feet ( 0.9 meters by 0.9 meters by 1.5 meters ) .
“ One of the least understood risks in space is how fire propagates ( and ) starts , ” said Jitendra Joshi , technology integration lead for NASA 's advanced exploration systems division . “ How do you control the fire ? How do you detect the fire ? All these things . You ca n't call 911 like on Earth to come help you . ”
Saffire 2 — short for Spacecraft Fire Experiment 2 — carries nine specimens to be set on fire Monday . It is a follow-up to the Saffire 1 experiment conducted in June after the last Cygnus mission left the space station , when a single 16-inch by 37-inch ( 0.4-meter by 0.94-meter ) cotton fiber cloth was ignited .
Once surprise from the Saffire 1 experience was that the cotton material burned slower than predicted , Joshi said .
Each of the nine samples on Saffire 2 measure 2 inches by 10 inches ( 5 centimeters by 25 centimeters ) , and scientists will use the specimens to assess the response of each material and oxygen flammability limits , according to NASA .
Four of the materials to be burned Monday are made of silicon , and each of the samples has a different thickness , Joshi said .
“ Thickness affects how fire happens , how well a material burns , ” Joshi said . “ This is one of the most prevalent materials used ( on spacecraft ) which is flammable . ”
Saffire 2 also carries a sample of Nomex , a commercial fire retardant , plus smaller specimens of the cotton fiber cloth burned on the first Saffire experiment in June , which was the first time scientists ever conducted such a large-scale flame investigation in space .
Previous fire experiments in space were limited to items no larger than an index card , and the uninhabited , but pressurized volume inside the Cygnus spacecraft offers a suitable host for more ambitious flammability investigations .
“ Cygnus had a successful , month-long stay at the International Space Station , delivering critical cargo to the astronauts , ” said Frank Culbertson , president of Orbital ATK 's space systems group . “ Now , we get another opportunity to showcase this unique spacecraft 's expanded capabilities beyond its core cargo delivery function . To use Cygnus yet again as a research platform demonstrates a versatility and flexibility that we are proud to offer to our customers . ”
A third Saffire experiment is planned on the next Cygnus flight set for launch in March , and Joshi said scientists are working on more Saffire payloads that could fly in the coming years .
Joshi said the results of the Saffire experiments , developed by a team based at NASA 's Glenn Research Center in Ohio , will help engineers select safer materials for use inside future piloted spacecraft .
“ All these things need qualification , so to build more reliable missions ( and ) to build more self-sustaining missions as we move farther from low Earth orbit , Saffire will go a long way , ” Joshi said .
Data collected by Saffire 2 's sensors will be downlinked to the ground Tuesday and Wednesday .
By Friday , the Cygnus spaceship will be flying at an altitude of more than 300 miles , or around 500 kilometers . That is more than 60 miles ( 100 kilometers ) higher than the space station 's orbit .
Four Lemur 2 CubeSats owned by Spire Global will eject from a NanoRacks deployer mounted outside the Cygnus spacecraft in two pairs Friday at 4:05 p.m. EST ( 2105 GMT ) and 7:10 p.m. EST ( 0010 GMT ) .
Spire 's satellites are about the size of a shoebox and each weigh around 11 pounds , or 5 kilograms , according to information provided by the company to federal regulatory authorities .
The Lemur 2 CubeSats will deploy an antenna soon after deployment and begin dual missions tracking global maritime traffic and collecting weather data .
The San Francisco-based company already has about a dozen Lemur 2 satellites in orbit , with dozens more under construction and awaiting launch .
Spire won a $ 370,000 contract from NOAA in September to supply pilot data for the weather agency to determine the information 's usefulness . If the pilot program proves fruitful , NOAA could place an order for more weather data from Spire and other commercial satellite startups to supplement measurements from government-owned satellites .
The Lemur 2 satellites carry GPS radio occultation antennas , using satellite navigation signals passed through Earth 's atmosphere to derive temperature and humidity profiles that can be fed into numerical forecast models .
The Cygnus spacecraft is heading to a higher orbit for the CubeSat deployments to allow the Lemur 2 satellites to have longer lifetimes without being pulled down as quickly by atmospheric drag .
With its duties complete , the Cygnus supply ship is scheduled to conduct a deorbit burn Sunday to steer for a controlled destructive re-entry over the South Pacific Ocean .
Orbital ATK is readying its next Cygnus spacecraft for launch to the space station in March on top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket . The company announced earlier this month that its next cargo mission would launch from Cape Canaveral on an Atlas 5 , rather than from Virginia on an Antares , as officials originally planned .
Frank DeMauro , vice president of Orbital ATK 's human space systems division , said NASA approached the company in recent weeks seeking a way to carry more supplies and experiments to the space station next year .
The station 's other U.S. cargo service — SpaceX 's Dragon capsule — is grounded as engineers investigate a Falcon 9 rocket explosion on a launch pad in Florida in September . NASA officials do not expect Dragon deliveries to the research complex to resume until some time in early 2017 .
Flying the Cygnus spacecraft on an Atlas 5 rocket should allow the mission to carry more than 660 pounds ( 300 kilograms ) more cargo than if the supply ship launched on an Antares , DeMauro said .
The pressurized cargo module for the next flight , dubbed OA-7 , should arrive at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center from Thales Alenia Space in Italy in early December , DeMauro said . The Orbital ATK-made service and propulsion module will ship to Florida from Dulles , Virginia , in January .
The launch is scheduled for no earlier than mid-March .
Orbital ATK officials said the OA-7 launch in March will be the first of four Cygnus supply missions to the station in a 12-month period through early 2018 . The subsequent three are slated to launch aboard Orbital ATK 's own Antares rockets .

Anthony Scaramucci was brought into the White House to fine-tune President Trump 's message and banish the leakers . Despite a short stint , the former hedge fund manager had some darn interesting quotes . Here are their ‘ greatest hits , ' along with a compilation video made by /pol/ News Forever .
https : //twitter.com/polNewsForever/status/892133149865652224
Newsweek reports :
10 . “ I love the guy , and I wish them well , and I hope they go on to make a tremendous amount of money ”
The Mooch wished outgoing Press Secretary Sean Spicer , who resigned in response to Scaramucci 's hiring , financial success in their post-White House life . Spicer is reportedly being courted to appear on Dancing With The Stars .
9 . “ If the president says it , let me do more research on it… There 's probably some level of truth to it . ”
Asked about the president 's debunked claim that more than 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election , Scaramucci defended Trump 's remark .
8 . “ You 're an American citizen , this is a major catastrophe for the American country . So I 'm asking you as an American patriot to give me a sense of who leaked it . ”
The first quote on the list from the New Yorker interview , Scaramucci was essentially questioning the patriotism of the reporter for reporting that Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox executive Bill Shine had dinner with the president and first lady .
7 . “ If Reince wants to explain he 's not a leaker , let them do that . ”
Scaramucci feuded publically with Priebus throughout their tenure as communications director .
6 . “ Remember Joe Paterno ? What would they say ? ‘ Act like you 've been there before . ' Act with honor and dignity and respect and hold the confidence of the presidency in their office , ”
Scaramucci cited the former Penn State football coach who resigned in disgrace amind a child sexual abuse scandal featuring their former Defensive Coordinator Jerry Sandusky .
5 . “ I 've seen this guy throw a dead spiral through a tire . I 've seen them at Madison Square Garden with a topcoat on . He 's standing in the key and he 's hitting foul shots and swishing them , okay ? They sink 3-foot putts . ”
The Mooch praised the president for their athletic abilities during their first press conference .
4 . “ This is the problem with the leaking . This is actually a terrible thing . Let 's say I 'm firing Michael Short today . The fact that you guys know about it before they do really upsets me as a human being and as a Roman Catholic . ”
Scaramucci told Politico 's Tara Palmeri that they were planning on firing Short , and the news was reported before Scaramucci actually fired him . Short resigned as Scaramucci said they were planning to “ fire everybody ” to stop West Wing leaks .
3 . “ We have had odds , we have had differences . When I said we were brothers from the podium , it 's because we are rough on each other . Some brothers are like Cain and Abel . ”
Scaramucci invoked the Bible story in which Cain murders their brother Abel to describe their relationship with Priebus .
2 . “ Reince is a f * cking paranoid schizophrenic , a paranoiac… . ‘ Oh , Bill Shine is coming in . Let me leak the f * cking thing and see if I can c * ck-block these people the way I c * ck-blocked Scaramucci for six months . ' ”
1 . “ I 'm not Steve Bannon , I 'm not trying to suck my own c * ck … I 'm not trying to build my own brand off the f * cking strength of the President . I 'm here to serve the country . ”
The proposal , unveiled in April as part of Mr. Obama 's budget , is far from dead . On Tuesday , a committee in the Democrat-controlled Senate is scheduled to work on its version of the bill , one that makes no mention of capturing asteroids but gives leeway to NASA to do whatever it thinks best for getting to Mars . On the same day , experts will convene at NASA headquarters in Washington to review work on the asteroid mission so far .
As yet , those experts have not pinpointed an asteroid to kidnap , but the idea is this : First , build a robotic spacecraft with a novel inflatable cone-shaped structure that could envelop the asteroid ( which will be tricky to catch , because it will probably be spinning ) . Next , meet the space rock as it swings by the vicinity of the Earth and the Moon . Then , after essentially wrapping the asteroid in a bag ( no lassos are actually involved ) , the spacecraft would lug it into orbit above the Moon , a slow do-si-do of mechanics that could take a few years .
“ Over all , I think this is a very doable mission , ” said Brian Muirhead , the chief engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
After that , astronauts would travel aboard a giant new rocket that NASA is designing , to meet the asteroid for a closer look . Their trip would give NASA the opportunity to test its deep-space spacecraft , the Orion capsule , as well as its procedures for helping astronauts work with asteroids , which have almost no gravity .
Asteroids have been having their moment in the news , in part because of the terrifying asteroid explosion over Russia in February , which injured about 1,500 people . Last month , NASA announced an Asteroid Grand Challenge , inviting people and organizations to collaborate in finding asteroids that threaten Earth and proposing solutions . On Friday , the agency said it had received more than 400 responses to the challenge and suggestions to help with the asteroid capture mission .
Separately , at least two private companies have announced intentions to mine asteroids for rare metals , arguing that supplies on Earth are dwindling .
There is near unanimity in Congress and NASA that the ultimate goal is to send people to Mars , but the logistical challenges and costs are too big to conquer right away . NASA officials depict the asteroid capture plan as an elegant interim step , one that would send humans deeper into space than before and break new ground in rocket technology .
Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) told reporters Monday afternoon that former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice “ ought to testify under oath ” after Bloomberg News 's Eli Lake revealed that , during the presidential transition , they deliberately sought to “ unmask ” President Donald Trump 's associates from intelligence surveillance .
Paul called the reports that Rice made dozens of requests to learn more about the identities of anonymous people thought to be close to the Trump transition team , inadvertently caught on tape during investigations into foreign persons of intelligence interest , “ enormous news . ”
“ If it is allowed , we should n't be allowing it . I do n't think we should discount how big a deal it is that Susan rice was looking at these , ” Paul told the assembled reporters .
The Kentucky Senator then cut to the heart of the growing political fight behind what President Trump has called “ wiretapping . ”
“ She needs to be asked , ‘ did President Obama ask them to do this ? ' I think they ought to testify under oath on this , ” Paul opined .
Paul also tried to tie Monday 's revelations about Rice to the slew of leaks on the topic around the time of the handover of the White House . “ I think they should be asked under oath , did they reveal it to the Washington Post ? ” they asked .
Paul , long a critic of this type of warrentless intelligence wiretapping and its potential to capture the communications of American citizens , was quick to tie the issues together . “ I do n't think you should be allowed to listen to Americans ' conversations without a warrant , ” Paul said . “ They are targeting a foreigner , and because they are targeting a foreigner they are gathering all of this information on Americans . ”
“ A million Americans are apparently caught up in these incidental conversations , ” Paul continued . “ Everybody in the Trump Administration transition , they could basically look at those conversations . ”
Humans have very limited ability to regenerate heart muscle cells , which is a key reason why heart attacks that kill cells and scar heart tissue are so dangerous .
But damaged heart muscles in the amazing , highly regenerative zebrafish have given Duke University Medical Center scientists a few ideas that may lead to new directions in clinical research and better therapy after heart attacks .
`` Our hearts do n't seem so complex that they should n't have the capacity to regenerate , '' said Kenneth Poss , Ph.D. , senior author of the study in Nature and professor of cell biology at Duke . The data in this study showed that the major contributors to the regeneration of surgically removed heart muscle came from a subpopulation of heart muscle cells ( cardiomyocytes ) near the area where the removal occurred .
The study appears in the March 25 issue of Nature .
The team labeled cells in the heart and found that cells that activated the gata4 gene upon injury ultimately contributed to regenerating the heart muscle .
The team first used a labeled `` fluorescent reporter '' fish that shows the presence of gata4 , a gene required for heart formation in the developing embryo . They found that fluorescence was undetectable in uninjured zebrafish ventricles , but when they clipped a small section of the heart , a subpopulation of cardiac muscle cells along the outer wall of the ventricles began to fluoresce . Some of these cells near the removal site ultimately proliferate and integrate into the wound , replacing the injury clot .
`` We do n't know the instructions or the mechanisms yet that mobilize these cells or cause them to proliferate , but we now know that they are the cells that are participating in new muscle growth , '' said Poss , who is also an investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
Finding a key origin of heart muscle provides a target for studies that will help scientists understand cardiac muscle regeneration , said lead author Kazu Kikuchi , a postdoctoral fellow in the Poss lab . `` By studying this important cell population , we expect results that could help in the repair of diseased human hearts . ''
The team uncovered other interesting findings .
They still needed to know whether the new cardiomyocytes were connecting in a useful way to the muscle that was spared by injury . They found that within two weeks of the injury , the new heart cells started to show normal electrical coupling needed to keep the heart beating in rhythm . A month later , the electric coupling was the same as in the uninjured heart , Poss said . `` This is the first evidence that I know of that the new cardiomyocytes do become electrically coupled . It 's exciting because the new muscle has to approach the functional level of the existing muscle to be of use . '' This experiment was done in collaboration with colleagues at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .
Another finding was that the fish heart muscle found a way to work around scar tissue , a finding with interesting implications for the human heart , which stubbornly scars after heart muscle dies during a heart attack . Poss and the team found a genetic way to manipulate the zebrafish to slow down the regenerative process and form cardiac scars after tissue removal , which they normally do n't do .
The scientists were able to make the tissue form a scar by blocking a certain genetic signaling pathway . Then they returned the activity of the pathway to the animal to learn whether regeneration could occur after scar tissue formed .
The manipulation worked , and the researchers saw the gata4 label expressed in cells near the scar . They could also see a wall of new muscle forming around the scarred tissue removal site .
`` I think this experiment is relevant to a lot of heart attack victims who have established scars , '' Poss said . `` We would like to know ultimately to what extent regenerative therapy of the heart could help people who have lived with scars for a long time . When we allowed the regenerative signaling pathway to remain active after the scar was formed , we did n't see removal of scar tissue , but we did see improvements in the tissue near those injuries . ''
Poss said there is more to learn from the zebrafish . `` We want to know the sources of all of the different cell types in the regenerated heart tissue , and the molecular events responsible for activating those sources , '' they said . `` There is a lot left to learn about the mysterious regenerative abilities of animals like zebrafish and salamanders . ''

It 's time to blow it up . No more half-measures for the Knicks . No more aging vets who no longer more than big names . No more stop gaps . This franchise needs to build from the ground up . This franchise needs Sam Hinkie and their Process .
The former 76ers general manager who was jettisoned from Philadelphia as their master plan was finally starting to take shape is exactly what the Knicks need right now . They need Hinkie and they need patience . The lack of the latter has done this franchise in for two decades now .
New York has gone through numerous general managers and coaches over that time . The only constant has been owner James Dolan and a Get Rich Quick approach to roster construction .
The lure of New York and the Garden and the Knicks mystique ( stop laughing ) is n't what it used to be . Not in the age of social media , where our sports stars are not hurting for exposure . Dolan and whomever they appoint as their next GM needs to realize this . Big name free agents wo n't flock to New York for a chance to play at MSG or to enhance their brand . The Knicks are n't going to go out and land a superstar in free agency . Not with the reputation for dysfunction the franchise has earned over the last 20 years .
The Knicks are years away from contention , and they 'll need a visionary who understands that shortcuts wo n't cut it . It appeared as if Phil Jackson , who mutually agreed to part ways with the Knicks on Wednesday , was that visionary . During their first few seasons in charge , they traded away vets like Tyson Chandler and J.R. Smith for picks and younger players . They drafted a player the team could build around in Kristaps Porzingis . The Knicks were rebuilding . Finally .
Then last offseason happened , and things started to unravel for Jackson . They traded for a 28-year-old Derrick Rose and their 50-year-old knees . They gave a washed-up Joakim Noah a $ 72 million contract . Then Jackson inked Carmelo Anthony , whose days as a bona fide superstar were over , a five-year , $ 125 million contract that included a no-trade clause . The Knicks had built their version of the Super Team , just five years too late .
Nobody in their right mind — not even Jackson — believed this was a championship roster . It was barely a playoff roster on paper . But the Knicks had mortgaged their future to chase a false sense of relevancy instead of doing the right thing by sitting out of free agency , letting ‘ Melo walk and starting to build around Porzingis .
The 2016-17 season was predictably a disaster . Phil feuded with just about everyone . Noah was a bigger bust than we all imagined they would be . Rose publicly criticized the Triangle and decided not to show up for a game against the Pelicans . Porzingis , the one thing Knicks fans had to hold onto , did n't show up for their end-of-season meeting and feuded with the front office .
The only thing the Knicks accelerated was their downfall .
That brings us back to Hinkie . A man who wo n't be afraid to take their time , as they proved by constantly flipping draft picks and players to slowly put the 76ers in better position to land franchise-altering players . You might think their time in Philadelphia may have damaged their trust in the Process — and it may have in the weeks and months after their dismissal — but the excitement surrounding the 76ers has repaired their reputation to a certain degree . The Process is no longer a running joke ; it 's now something fans will embrace it .
Hinkie would have a head start in rebuilding the Knicks from the ground up . Porzingis is a player worth building around . He 's only 21 , so the Knicks would n't be wasting their prime as they carry out the Process . Hinkie would already have their center of the future in place , as well . Willy Hernangomez is n't a foundational player , but he 's perfect for today 's NBA game . They can score around the basket thanks to a soft touch and should develop into a capable long-range shooter in the next few years . Prozingis and Hernangomez are a good start .
The rest of the roster is expendable . It 's going to be difficult to get Noah off the books , but if Magic Johnson can find away to get rid of Timofey Mozgov , Hinkie should be able to find a way . The Knicks wo n't be able to get a whole lot in return for Anthony because of that no-trade clause which limits New York 's options , but anything will do at this point . A divorce is needed and it will , at the very least , allow the Knicks to bottom out and position themselves for a top pick in next year 's draft .
In Courtney Lee and Lance Thomas , Hinkie would have some pieces to dangle in front of contenders looking to bolster their rosters before next year 's trade deadline . Those two should bring in some decent assets Hinkie can flip in the future .
The next few years are n't going to be fun for Knicks fans . There are no quick and dirty solutions to the mess Dolan and their band of failed GMs have made over the last two decades . But bringing in a guy like Hinkie would at least give fans some hope for the future . That 's more than they 've had in a very long time .
Douglas Hughes faces charges for violating restricted airspace after landing a gyrocopter on the U.S. Capitol lawn on April 15 to protest campaign finance laws . ( Borchuck , James/Tampa Bay Times )
The Florida postal worker who landed a gyrocopter at the U.S. Capitol to protest campaign finance laws rejected a new deal to plead guilty to a felony in the incident , they said Thursday , after prosecutors reopened negotiations in the case .
Douglas Hughes , 61 , of Ruskin , Fla. , faces six felony and misdemeanor counts after flying their low-powered gyrocopter from Gettysburg , Pa. , to the District on April 15 . They said they were delivering letters to members of Congress , and has pleaded not guilty .
However , the unusual flight has created an unusual challenge for the U.S. attorney 's office in the District .
Prosecutors said that Hughes 's actions were reckless and endangered their life and others , but have acknowledged that their flight led them to file charges that have rarely if ever gone to trial .
If Hughes were convicted on all counts they would face a sentence of zero to 9 1/ 2 years in prison . To avoid a trial , prosecutors originally proposed a plea bargain in which Hughes would plead guilty for a recommended sentence of 10 months in prison . Hughes 's defense argued that zero to six months was appropriate .
Recently , however , U.S. probation officials reported that Hughes 's flight was unprecedented , and they could not find any applicable case to guide a possible sentencing recommendation to the court .
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said at a court hearing Thursday that lack of a similar case would leave them free to decide an appropriate penalty if Hughes is convicted . They added that probation officials said the most comparable offense was trespassing .
[ What 's a gyrocopter ? And how did Mr. Hughes get to Washington ? ]
Preparations for trial early next year continue . But based on the new information , Assistant U.S. Attorney Tejpal S. Chawla said , “ We 've reinitiated conversations about a plea , ” and that the parties spoke several times Wednesday , including once for more than hour .
After the Thursday hearing , Hughes said they rejected prosecutors ' latest offer that they plead guilty to a single felony , saying conviction would restrict their rights , such as their ability to vote or hold office .
“ I am not at all optimistic ” about reaching a deal , Hughes said .
[ In their own words : Doug Hughes 's flight for democracy ]
Prosecutors in July had proposed that Hughes agree to plead guilty to operating their lightweight craft without registration — a felony — and to a misdemeanor count of violating federal airspace . They would have received a 10-month sentence .
Hughes has said their midday flight — while wearing their letter carrier 's uniform aboard what was described as a flying lawn chair powered by a small motor-driven propeller — caused no injuries or damage and was intended to call attention to the corrupting influence of money in politics .
“ I did n't do anything that justifies giving up my rights , ” Hughes said Thursday . “ I had a purpose for flying here , and I have n't even started to conclude what I came here for. ” The fight has just begun , they said .

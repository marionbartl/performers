SEATTLE — Masahiro Tanaka is neither impressed nor surprised that a little more than two months into their first major league season , they are one of only two pitchers with 10 victories .
After all , that is the point . They play the game to win , which was why the Yankees signed them to a seven-year , $ 155 million contract in the off-season .
Winning may not be the only thing , but it 's what they do best . In their final season with the Rakuten Eagles in Japan a year ago , they had a 24-0 record . In 13 starts for the Yankees , Tanaka is 10-1 .
Still , after their complete-game 4-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners Wednesday night , Tanaka told members of the Japanese news media that they would not describe themselves as successful . Their argument was that they signed a seven-year contract , and they are two months into it .

NICOSIA , Cyprus ( AP ) — Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday mocked U.S. news reports suggesting President Donald Trump inappropriately shared sensitive intelligence with them about terror threats involving laptops on airplanes .
Without directly confirming the details of their conversation , Lavrov said they did n't understand what the “ secret ” was since the U.S. introduced a ban on laptops on airlines from some Middle Eastern countries two months ago .
They joked that some U.S. media were acting like communist newspapers in the former Soviet Union and not offering real news .
“ There used to be a joke in the Soviet Union that there was no news in the newspaper Pravda and no truth in the newspaper Izvestia , ” Lavrov said through a translator . “ It 's true , I get the impression , that many U.S. media are working in this vein . ”
The Russian word “ pravda ” means truth , while “ izvestia ” means news . They are also the names of two long-running newspapers in Russia .
Lavrov was in Cyprus on Thursday for talks with their Cypriot counterpart .
Asked to comment on the controversy surrounding the reported intelligence-sharing , they said media have reported that “ the secret ” Trump told them was that ” ‘ terrorists ' are capable of stuffing laptops , all kinds of electronic devices , with untraceable explosive materials . ”
“ As far as I can recall , maybe one month or two months before the Trump administration had an official ban on laptops on airlines from seven middle Eastern counties and it was connected directly with the terrorist threat , ” Lavrov added . “ So , if you 're talking about that , I see no secret here . ”
The Washington Post reported this week that Trump shared highly classified information with Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak about an Islamic State terror threat involving laptop computers on aircraft . Other outlets , including The Associated Press , later confirmed the report .
Trump responded by tweeting that as president , they had authority to disclose whatever he 'd like . They did not deny discussing classified information .
Kansas City Chiefs star pass-rusher Justin Houston likely will miss Sunday 's game against the Denver Broncos because of an injured elbow , team and league sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter .
Houston has a dislocated right elbow , an injury they suffered in last weekend 's loss to the San Diego Chargers .
The 24-year-old Houston was scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday , but it was postponed because of swelling in the elbow .
The Chiefs ( 9-2 ) also could be without two-time Pro Bowl linebacker Tamba Hali for their rematch with the AFC West rival Broncos ( 9-2 ) , who have the league 's top-ranked offense .
Hali suffered a slight ankle sprain against San Diego , according to Chiefs coach Andy Reid , but may not be able to play against Denver .
Houston appeared in the locker room Monday with their arm tightly bound and in a sling . When they were approached by reporters , Houston said they were told not to say anything .
Frank Zombo and Dezman Moses replaced Houston and Hali against San Diego .
IN THE movie WALL·E , humankind has left Earth in a bit of a mess . The planet is choked with garbage and all the people have shipped out , leaving robot WALL·E to clean the place up and make it habitable again . Things may not be quite that bad yet , but there 's no doubt that we produce a huge amount of waste . Even with increased recycling , landfill sites are filling up by the day and -in the absence of a plucky robot – the waste experts of planet Earth are working on the next best thing : landfill mining .
The idea is simple . Instead of disappearing under mountains of our own waste , while paying through the nose for diminishing commodities , why not dig up and recycle what we have already thrown away ?
Next week , industry experts will gather in London for the first global landfill mining conference . Bringing together environmental scientists , economists and landfill operators , the one-day meeting promises to show delegates how to turn waste into “ garbage gold ” .
Landfill mining has been tried before . The first scheme began in 1953 at Hiriya garbage dump outside Tel Aviv , Israel , and aimed to reclaim fine-particle waste rich in minerals to improve soil quality at local citrus fruit farms . The landfill closed in 1998 , but the recycling plant that remains on the site still produces soil improver from green waste . Then during the 1960s and 1970s , a handful of sites in the US began separating waste to recycle the steel and to compost food scraps . In the late 1980s , a pilot programme was set up to extract recyclables from a …
A puddle of green goop was spotted waiting for the subway at the 34th Street-Herald Square station this morning , but actually it 's nothing to worry about , and is in fact the good kind of goop , according to the MTA .
`` The color is from a green dye that was placed in the water source in the area to help locate a known water leak in that location , '' MTA spokesperson Amanda Kwan told Gothamist . `` The structure that is above that water leak is a water pipe . It has been cleaned . ''
Still , it 's not every day that a pool of snot-colored liquid with a cloudy hurricane eye appears at your local station . Commuter Nick Caruso , who shared the photo with us , says they were initially worried that the substance was a chemical coolant , but was reassured by the MTA 's quick online response .
Dear @ mta and @ nyc311 :
There is green chemical coolant leaking and pooling in the Herald Square station this morning .
Not acceptable . pic.twitter.com/gv984phb0f — Nick Caruso ( @ thenickcaruso ) July 27 , 2017
Caruso also said that there were `` No smells apparent , beyond the 'usual ' subway musk , and at the rate the liquid was dripping , I 'd say it had been going since very early this morning , which would mean throughout today 's rush hour . ''
Good thing it 's totally harmless green goop and not that radioactive green goop that will spawn a new generation of mutant chihuahua-sized rats with a lust for human toes .
In previous episodes of 'Name Of That Subway Fluid ' : the blood-soaked newspaper trail on the 7 train , the Airborn Nontoxic Gas Event at Times Square last year , and the great gushing waterfall of the 6 train .
There 's also this puddle of green sludge that oozes through the streets of Midtown every so often , which is probably fine , also .
Tencent is using its social networks , WeChat and QQ , and video games to build an entertainment juggernaut .
Riot Games has been on a winning streak . Its League of Legends is the most popular PC game in the world . The game 's professional leagues have media rights worth in the hundreds of millions . If you 're a gamer you 've likely heard of Riot ; if not , the LA-based game developer might be — as Inc. magazine called it — “ the most exciting company you 've never heard of. ” It is also central to the growth strategy of Tencent , the biggest Chinese internet company and Riot 's owner . Tencent is best known for building WeChat , the world 's second-largest social media network , with more than 700 million users . But Tencent has another , less-recognized identity , as the largest gaming company in the world .
Tencent owns not only Riot but also Supercell , the maker of wildly popular mobile phone games . By all appearances , messaging and gaming may seem like completely different enterprises , with totally distinct business models . But that 's where Tencent has uniquely excelled . The company has found a symbiotic way to monetize both , through the astonishingly lucrative sales of virtual goods such as avatars , skins , and other digital artifacts for personalizing your online presence . Characters and skins from Tencent 's video game empire can become stickers and other ephemera that get distributed throughout its massive messaging platforms .
Think of virtual goods as phase one for Tencent — an essential precursor to the company 's next metamorphosis . Now it 's using its game assets and its social network to bridge naturally into every other form of entertainment . Just as Disney used the characters from its signature films to sell merchandise , music , spin-off shows , games , and tickets to its theme parks , Tencent is using its video game assets to fuel a books , comics , music and film empire . Instead of first meeting Tencent 's money-making characters in a movie , as you would have with Disney , you might first control them in a game on your phone , or encounter them as a sticker sent by a friend .
It 's worth pausing to note how unusual it is that the world 's next Disney-like conglomerate is emerging from a company that began with text messaging . Yet the Tencent story makes plenty of sense , once you dig into the company 's past .
Tencent was founded in 1998 , and the following year it released its first messaging app , QQ . In 2004 , it went public and started an online gaming business focused on casual games , such as chess , which it added to QQ.com . In that time period , two of Tencent 's Chinese competitors , Shanda Interactive Entertainment and NetEase , began to profit handsomely off of free-to-play gaming . Under this model , you can play significant chunks of a game without handing over a dime , and only devotees pay to access more in-game content , such as extra levels or nice hats .
So Tencent switched from developing its own games , which was never its strength , to licensing already successful , more immersive games and using its massive scale to distribute them . In 2008 , Tencent began licensing popular multiplayer games made in the US and South Korea — such as CrossFire , Dungeon & Fighter , and League of Legends — to be published in China .
Having already become involved with League of Legends , Tencent had every reason to pay attention to Riot . It first participated in the gaming company 's $ 8 million Series C round in 2009 , before increasing its ownership stake from 22.34 percent to 92.78 percent for $ 231 million in 2011 . In 2015 , Tencent fully acquired Riot for an undisclosed amount . Through its acquisitions and its investments , Tencent had swiftly become far and away the most powerful global company with a stake in gaming .
The internet giant has continued its buying spree , the most notable acquisition being that of Supercell , a Helsinki-based mobile game studio , for $ 7.8 billion last year . Supercell is the most profitable maker of phone games in the world , earning €845 million off of €2.11 billion in revenue in 2015 . Its Clash of Clans is estimated to have been the top grossing mobile game that year . In 2016 , the App Store named its new game , Clash Royale , the iPhone Game of the Year .
To understand why Tencent was willing to shell out astronomical sums for these companies , you have to look at what they offered , and what it was that Tencent very much wanted : virtual goods .
Unlike the titans of California , Tencent has n't relied heavily on advertising to become profitable . In 2015 ( the most recent available data ) , online advertising accounted for 17 percent of Tencent 's annual revenue , versus 89.9 percent for Google and 95 percent for Facebook .
Instead , Tencent found a lucrative path through the sale of virtual goods — a way for users to personalize their online experience . In products like QQ , that means buying a custom avatar and accessories to embellish that avatar . In games like League of Legends , that means buying a skin to personalize the look of your favorite champion .
Virtual goods are also the primary way free-to-play games such as League of Legends and CrossFire ( 2014 's top-grossing online game , also distributed in China by Tencent ) make money . This model works especially well in China , where years of rampant piracy weakened the traditional retail model , where customers buy games in a box in a store . In Tencent 's financial reports , revenue from online games and virtual goods are grouped together under “ value-added services. ” In 2015 , this category accounted for a whopping 78 percent of the company 's $ 15.8 billion in annual income .
But Tencent 's ability to identify selling opportunities around its content does n't end with avatars and skins . By 2011 , it had developed something even more ambitious — its “ pan entertainment ” strategy .
The idea was for Tencent to leverage its intellectual property ( IP ) , mainly from games , across multiple kinds of entertainment : live-action and animated films , books , music , and more . This pan entertainment strategy is now widely adopted by large Chinese gaming companies — in the US , by contrast , these outfits tend to focus solely on making games ( with the exception of Blizzard Entertainment , which has dabbled in offshoots ) . Tencent began branching into these areas first with a comic and animation business in 2012 , followed by a digital books publishing business — Tencent Literature — in 2013 , and most recently Tencent Pictures in 2014 .
In other words , Tencent was starting to look a lot like Disney .
The core of Disney 's IP engine has long been theatrical films . Successful movies spawned music productions , home video , stage plays , TV series , theme parks and resorts , a wealth of merchandise , video games , and more . Disney paid $ 4 billion for Marvel in 2009 and $ 4 billion for Lucasfilm and the legendary Star Wars franchise in 2012 . We can all see the results of the successful commercial exploitation of those assets , many of which have become some of the highest grossing movies of all time , globally .
Like Disney , Tencent continues to gobble up valuable IP . The company announced $ 20.8 billion of acquisitions and investments in 2016 alone , according to data compiled by Bloomberg . Tencent is just starting to test out what it can do with all this content . For example , three writer-producers of The Simpsons and the animation house that created Futurama created Clash-a-Rama , a comedy series based off of Supercell characters . Meanwhile , Riot has experimented with cinematics ( short CG videos designed to develop backstories for characters in games ) , launched a full-fledged merchandise business , and created a board game .
These are all experiments leading in one direction : movies . Tencent is jockeying with Alibaba Pictures and Wanda Group for its share of China 's projected $ 10.4 billion in box-office receipts , a movie market second only to the US 's . China seems to have an insatiable demand for film . In 2015 , there were 5,660 cinemas with 28,000 screens , with 15 new screens open daily . By comparison , the US had 40,547 screens that year . Each screen serves roughly 46,000 people in China versus 8,000 here .
Wanda Group , which controls 15 percent of global box-office revenues , has focused on acquiring film studios , including some big American ones — buying Legendary Entertainment for $ 3.5 billion and Dick Clark Productions for $ 1 billion in 2016 alone . Tencent , consistent with its gaming strategy , continues to focus on acquiring IP .
Specifically , Tencent has gone after genres that are more natural fits for Chinese moviegoers than Americans : sci fi , comic book , and fantasy . Consider , for example , the film Warcraft , which is based off a Blizzard video game and is also a Tencent investment . Last year it was the third highest-grossing movie in China , at $ 220.8 million , versus $ 47 million in the US , where it received a lukewarm reception . As Mark Ren , COO of Tencent , said in a speech , “ We can take the content of games or literature and recompose them into movies and TV series , and that helps us inject fresh blood in the movie industry . ”
Tencent has identified at least 11 comics , games , and novels it wants to turn into movies in the near future . It 's also bought the rights to more than 300 Japanese anime properties . These assets could lead to the creation of a Marvel-like universe with an addictive common thread , along the lines of Infinity Stones , which conceptually tie together Marvel 's cinematic universe .
What this all means is that Tencent has found a way to manufacture , at scale , tremendous cross-platform brand loyalty . After spending years within its social media ecosystem , users are loathe to leave . Gamers , who have devoted potentially thousands of hours to playing and thousands of dollars to looking cool while doing so , are slow to move on to other games . Using film to build out the universes that users learn to love in games , comics and books deepens fans ' loyalty even more .
In other words , Tencent has morphed from a straightforward tech company into a fully contemporary , internet-savvy entertainment juggernaut . It 's like Disney , but even smarter .
It 's not easy to send money digitally .
Paypal , an early leader in the field , requires users to have a Paypal account . Users of Venmo , a mobile app , must also have an account , plus download the app .
And Google Wallet , first announced two years ago , has struggled to get wireless carriers and phone manufacturers to install what is called near-field communication technology . NFC technology is what would make it possible for certain Android users to wave their phone at a retailer 's receiver to make a payment .
But now , Google has announced that it will allow Gmail users to attach money to emails , just as they would a photo or a document , as shown in the video . The move could radically transform the way we exchange money with friends , family and even businesses .
Users who link their bank accounts to Google Wallet receive transactions for free . Those using debit or credit cards pay a 2.9 % transaction fee , and transactions are limited to $ 10,000 .
Given that Google is the world 's largest email provider , this could help give mobile payments the push they 've needed to go from being a novelty item to part of our everyday lives . As Quartz points out , text messaging has enabled mobile payments to become widely adopted in the developing world .
Google said it will gradually roll this service out to its Gmail users .
She 's more cordial than the headline suggests , emphasizing that reform would be okay if Rubio and the Republicans were in charge of border security rather than Obama and Schumer et al . I 'm … less confident about that than they are . Still , the clip 's useful as a demonstration of how even prominent border hawks are willing to cut Rubio slack for championing a bill that they dislike , which is remarkable insofar as passage would be impossible without their support . If you 're looking for one member of Congress who , more than any other , is singlehandedly making earned amnesty happen this year , it 's Rubio — and yet , despite the criticism ramping up lately , I think they remain basically unbruised . Partly that 's because of their conservative-media charm offensive , partly because he 's been shrewd in pounding Obama on other issues while this plays out to shore up their right-wing cred , and partly because smart righties like Ingraham do n't want to sabotage a guy with a legitimate chance to win in 2016 . Their response to their here , on the alleged economic benefits of mass legalization , is debatable on the merits and dubious insofar as virtually no one involved in this process in Congress is pursuing reform for that reason . Democrat wants to pad their electoral rolls with newly legalized voters and Republicans want to pass something as a goodwill gesture to Latinos . But they can sell it , ca n't he ? The only way he 'll be really hurt come 2016 , I think , is if the bill passes and starts to go off the rails in terms of enforcement before then . Even Rubio would have trouble selling that .
They claim , by the way , that there still are n't 60 votes in the Senate for it . At the Examiner , David Drucker 's sources are telling them the same thing :
Democratic and Republican sources working to build support for the bill agreed that garnering the necessary GOP votes would require amending the legislation to strengthen its border security components . Additionally , there are senators on both sides of the aisle who do n't support the current measure because of provisions other than border security who also must be appeased . The bill 's supporters are now focusing their efforts on wooing as many as five Democrats who might oppose it and about two dozen Republicans described as “ gettable ” or “ maybes ” but who for now are far from a “ yes ” vote . ( Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , is not among those targeted . ) The bill is scheduled to hit the floor next Monday , and Senate Democratic leaders said it may go up for a final vote before the July 4 recess… Republicans on the fence include Sens . Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker , of Tennessee ; Kelly Ayotte , of New Hampshire ; Richard Burr , of North Carolina ; Dan Coats , of Indiana ; Mike Crapo and Jim Risch , of Idaho ; Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson , of Georgia ; Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee , of Utah ; Dean Heller , of Nevada ; John Hoeven , of North Dakota ; Mike Johanns , of Nebraska ; Ron Johnson , of Wisconsin ; Mark Kirk of Illinois ; Rand Paul of Kentucky ; Rob Portman , of Ohio ; and Pat Toomey , of Pennsylvania .
That 's a lot of Republicans looking for ways to vote yes . Rubio themselves is working on a way to bring them onboard by rewriting the bill 's enforcement provisions so that Congress itself , not DHS , gets to write the plan for better border security . If you read last night 's QOTD , you know how skeptical border hawks are about that . Bottom line : Schumer and the Democrats will never agree to suspend the path to citizenship until Congress , which might be controlled by Republicans in 18 months , officially confirms that the border has been secured . The Democrats might tolerate tighter security but they 'll never tolerate making amnesty contingent upon it . Which , if you go back to the beginning of this fiasco , is what Rubio claimed he 'd insist upon when they talked about border-security “ triggers . ”
Here 's the clip , via Noah Rothman . Apropos of nothing , I 've been wondering since Sunday night 's cultural eruption over “ Game of Thrones ” how long it 'll be before political media starts working “ Red Wedding ” metaphors into its reporting . Here , let me be the first hack out of the gate : Is the Gang of Eight bills a “ Red Wedding ” for conservatives ? And if it is , is Rubio Robb Stark or Walder Frey ? I 'm leaning towards Stark just because I want Schumer to be Frey , but depending upon how the next month goes , I 'm willing to revisit that analogy .

A MAN hired a prostitute to come to their hotel room – and answered the door to their own daughter .
Titus Ncube , a married father-of-three , collapsed to the floor with shock while their daughter , 20 , fled the hotel in tears .
Mr Ncube , from Bulawayo , Zimbabwe , said they were having marital problems and decided to rent a room in a local hotel , followed by a prostitute .
They said : “ I am sorry for what I did . I spoke to my wife and daughter . I apologised for my actions as I just wanted my family back . My daughter has stopped doing what they were doing and is going back to school next year . My marital problems are not over , but we have a counsellor who is helping us to get over this most difficult period . ”
Their wife Rosemary said : “ If it were not for my children , I could have divorced them a long time ago . But because of the trauma that divorce has on children , I decided to stay . ”
Adding to speculation about imminent US intervention in Libya , the Pentagon has confirmed that 1,000 Marines on board the USS Bataan have been moved to the coast of Libya , not far from Tripoli .
The move follows a travel warning from the State Department earlier this week , urging all US citizens to “ depart immediately ” from Libya , warning they may be targeted for kidnapping or violent attacks .
The US began deploying Marines to Sicily two weeks ago in anticipation of the flare up , and days later Gen. Khalifa Hifter , a long-time US ally , launched a coup attempt against parliament .
Gen. Hifter 's attempted takeover did not go smoothly , and Islamist militias loyal to parliament have also moved to Tripoli , where a civil war seems set to break out at any moment .
The State Department has yet to make a decision on evacuating the US Embassy , but the move by the Marines suggests such an announcement could be imminent , as that would presumably be the pretext for deploying ground troops to the capital .

Redux version ( recommended , see `` notes '' below )
Imagine a car going at a speed of 400 km/h , that has a roof that is its bottom at the same time , and whose wheel is the size of a man . Add to that a turbo injection ( What ? 400 km/h were n't enough ? ! ) and rocket launchers . You find it difficult to imagine such a mode of transportation ? Well , the guys who invented this game definitely did n't have such a problem .
This racing game is really unique . The race is between six vehicles that go well enough on road , on the edges of walls or even on the ceiling of the tunnel . This is definitely an impressive sight . On the track , there are pads that will speed you up , and you slow down when you collide with surrounding objects or other vehicles . There are two slots for missiles ( straight , homing , etc . ) and a variety of assistances ( instant acceleration , slowing down other competitors , teleportation in front of a better placed driver , etc. ) . First you must pick those up on the track , and until you 've used what you have picked up , you ca n't take any new ones ; which can be tricky when you have two homing missiles that target the first-ranked driver and you are in the lead . Rockets and assistances will have a great effect on the outcome of the race . It will often happen that you 're in the lead for almost the entire race ; then your opponents unleash their arsenal at you and voila , you have dropped to last place . Of course , things can go in the opposite direction .
Story ? What bloody story ? Have you not realized by now that this game is madness ? There is no need for any kind of story : action is in control here . However , there are different drivers to choose from . They are : Tony , Lothar , Leon , Jet , Ria and Lenny ; Leon is my favorite . The differences between them are more than just cosmetic : you should choose depending on what style of driving you prefer . To that end , Tony is one of the fastest , but their car has the weakest grip , while Jet has a vehicle that sticks to the track perfectly but is weaker and slower than others .
Visually this game really excels . At the time , this was one of the most beautiful 3D racing games . The race tracks are various , they gleam and shine , and the phenomenal explosions of any surrounding buildings or competitors vehicles complete the sense of pleasure that your eyes transmit to your brain . You can race at night or day , in rain , snow , or beautiful sunny weather . The audio component is also excellent .
Two things have prevented this insanely fast race to gain the top mark . First is the camera , which is sometimes positioned too close to your vehicle - usually when you spin on the track - and cost you precious seconds while you get back to normal . Another problem is the difficulty of the game . On Easy , the game is easy , therefore there is no problem . But Hard should be called Insane or Nightmare . A new opponent , Yuri , appears and they are always first , no matter how well you drive ; and even if you are ahead of him , they will always end up 1st . Terribly frustrating . So , the game lacks a Normal difficulty level , which would represent a reasonable challenge .
Of course , the main strength of this game is in the multiplayer mode . Playing with a colleague on the same computer or over the Internet is the part of the game that should take the most of your time . So , if you have someone to play with , party on .
The Redux version ( second download link above ) is fixed by one the original authors Rob for better compatibility with modern Windows and some enhanced effects , and is recommended . It is hosted here with permission ( alternative download from Rob 's website ) . The first download link above has the original 1999 version ( see `` how to run '' below ) .
These instructions are to install the old original version of the game , from the first link above . The Redux version comes in a much easier installer .
Usually , running the file Install ( run me first ) .bat before running the game itself is sufficient , this script will set everything as it has to be and you should be fine .
However , if this does n't work for you , follow this guide :
* edit your Windows registry ( [ Start ] - > [ Run ... ] - > type regedit - > [ OK ] ) :
* go to : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Psygnosis\Rollcage\Installer

Universal is ramping up a movie version of the sci-fi franchise “ Battlestar Galactica , ” aiming to develop the film as a complete reimagining of the story .
“ Transcendence ” writer Jack Paglen has signed on to write the screenplay . Paglen has also committed to Ridley Scott 's “ Prometheus ” sequel for Fox that will start production this fall .
Original series creator Glen Larson will produce the “ Battlestar Galactica ” film .
There have been four “ Galactica ” TV series ( including the brief “ Galactica 1980 ” and “ Caprica ” ) . The first , starring Lorne Greene and Richard Hatch , ran during the 1978-79 season and was centered on humans engaged in a lengthy war against a cybernetic race known as the Cylons while searching for Earth .
In 2003 , a reimagined “ Battlestar Galactica ” miniseries aired on Sci Fi Channel . The series , starring Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell , went on to run for four seasons .
In 2009 , speculation emerged that Bryan Singer was attached to direct a “ Battlestar Galactica ” movie .
Universal 's exec VP of production Scott Bernstein and director of development Jay Polidoro are overseeing the latest version of “ Battlestar Galactica ” for the studio .
Warner Bros. will open “ Transcendence , ” starring Johnny Depp , on April 18 .
Paglen is represented by ICM Partners and Lichter Grossman Nichols Adler and Feldman . Larson is represented by the Lichtman Group , manager Denny Bond of Management 3 as well as attorneys Neville Johnson , Douglas Johnson and James Ryan of Johnson & Johnson .
Ever wondered how classic Nintendo games would look in first-person with a VR headset ? Well wonder no more than YouTuber Chadtronic has made videos detailing their experience combining the Oculus Rift with modded version of The Legend of Zelda : The Wind Waker , Metroid Prime , Ocarina of Time , and Mario Kart : Double Dash .
Not all games - or their emulations - are created equal and some function as a better fit for the Oculus Rift than others . Naturally Metroid Prime makes the smoothest transition , since the game was already designed with a first-person perspective in mind , but some of these other games sync well with it too - at least in part .
While playing The Wind Waker in first-person seems to defeat the point of Link 's incredibly expressive , wide-eyed avatar , there are moments where it really comes into its own - particularly when gliding about with a leaf overhead . I do n't think a fully first-person Zelda will ever work , but having the option to poke about the scenery from Link 's point of view is nice every now and again ( something you can do in the recent Wii U HD remake ) , and if Nintendo designed these games with VR headsets in mind from the get-go it could really be something - particularly in Mario Kart if you could drive one way while peering to the side to see your competition edge up .
For more retro-fitted Oculus fun , we saw a man try this a couple of weeks ago with the original The Legend of Zelda , something Chadtronic later attempted before going one step further down Nintendo 's pipeline .

Kawhi Leonard is expected to soon return to the Spurs ' lineup . ( AP )
SAN ANTONIO — Danny Green stepped out of the training room last Friday following the San Antonio Spurs ' biggest Kawhi-less win of the season , ready to flex for the 'gram . Not because Manu Ginobili beat the Boston Celtics with rafter-scrapping rainbow three-pointer over Al Horford , or because the Spurs continue to defy what teams are supposed to do when their best player — a perennial MVP candidate , no less — is sidelined . No , Green wanted to take a picture to post on Instagram with the handful of teammates who showed up wearing their best flannel shirts to the game .
Patty Mills , Pau Gasol , Brandon Paul and Derrick White were all ready and waiting . Green was growing impatient and nudged Rudy Gay and LaMarcus Aldridge to hurry up and get dressed at their locker-room stalls because the Spurs had a plane to catch to Phoenix . They went back in the training room for a few minutes to let Aldridge button their shirt and poked their head out once again for Gay .

“ What , man ? I 'm right here , ” Gay said as they slipped on their red and black flannel shirt . “ Give me five seconds . I 'm always ready for a picture — 'cause I look good . ”
Gay is looking even better these days in San Antonio . Longing for the chance to feel relevant again , Gay took a significant pay cut last summer for the chance to join an organization in which a player 's strengths are magnified and flaws masked by a system that has been humming without interruption for two solid decades . Even questionable fashion choices ( lumberjack attire ) and decisions ( you sure you wanted to tuck that shirt in , Gasol ? ) are no longer ridiculed when wins come with regularity . They can be celebrated with “ Flanny Fridays ” — as Gay referred to the flannel-shirt festivities . Green posted the photo later that night with the hashtag “ # flannygang . ”

Playing alongside Kawhi Leonard was also part of the appeal for Gay when they decided to come to San Antonio . But that opportunity has n't yet been afforded to Gay , who has served as part of the hole-filling spackle to help the franchise function in the absence of its franchise player . The ways in which Gay can contribute to a team beyond scoring are being recognized and appreciated like they never would have in previous stops , where losing made them easier to ignore .
“ It 's a situation where , you have to pay a lot of attention to detail and it 's a winning mentality . That 's something I was away from , for so long , you kind of create bad habits . I 've had to re-teach myself . And I 've had to continue to do it every day , ” Gay told Yahoo Sports . “ It 's great . Everybody helps each other . Everybody is held accountable . Everybody is on the same page . Everybody has one thing in mind , and that 's win . I wanted to be a part of that . ”
The Spurs will soon welcome back Leonard from one of the more peculiar injuries — a right quadriceps ailment whose origins and treatment have n't been clearly explained . What San Antonio has done without Leonard — a 19-8 record that 's good for third in the Western Conference — proves it is the one organization that does n't have an indispensable player in the regular season . Most of those wins also came with Tony Parker dealing with a ruptured right quadriceps sustained during the conference semifinals last season against Houston . The Spurs also have gone 33-12 without Leonard the past two seasons combined , a stunning 60-win pace .
“ Whoever is not there is not there . We do n't worry about them or think about it too much . We 've got to take care of as much of the business as we can , ” Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said . “ When they get there , they get there . We 're playing a lot of different people , a lot of different combinations . Some nights , it does n't work out real well . Other nights , it looks really good , but I think down the stretch , it 'll help us . ”
Popovich offered a hint as to how the Spurs refuse to crumble in the face of adversity during one of their must-watch , in-game television interviews last month . The Spurs had rallied from a 23-point deficit to eventually beat Oklahoma City , and Popovich said it was because of “ an attitude change from ‘ poor me ' to ‘ screw you . ' ”
That is what the Spurs are and have been for some time . The culture Popovich has established is why veterans like David West in 2015 and now Gay left significant money on the table to join the fold , why Duncan held on until they were 40 , Ginobili has done the same and Parker is begging to follow . Players and coaches speak of “ The System ” when it 's actually a long-preached philosophy that involves sacrificing for the good of the team , trust and instilling confidence . Believing in what you have allows role players to take the occasional star turns and the really talented players like Leonard to ascend to unexpected heights among the league 's best .
“ First of all , guys understand the system of what we 're trying to do here , and executing their role . Guys are not trying to do too much , or too little , ” Mills told Yahoo Sports . “ We 're getting good wins , and even when we do lose , they tend to be mistakes that we can fix . When [ Leonard ] comes back , we 're obviously going to have to adjust , but we 'll cross that bridge when we get to it . But so far this season , it 's been a team effort . Obviously , [ Aldridge ] has been carrying a huge part of the weight , but everybody else complements and understands what they need to do , so it 's a good way to feel for sure . ”
David Robinson retired in 2003 and the Spurs went on to win two of the next four championships . Tim Duncan retired and the Spurs went on to have just their seventh 60-win season in franchise history . Popovich has been the common thread for this sustained greatness , given their ability to innovate , adjust and be open to change . Their flexibility in regard to Aldridge , bending the offense to make the All-Star big man feel more comfortable and empowered , has been essential to the Spurs maintaining without Leonard . Aldridge , the Spurs ' first major free-agent signing who had grown unhappy with how they were utilized their first two seasons , has restored their standing as one of the league 's best big men — all from a spirited heart-to-heart conversation with the demanding coach who would n't let stubborn pride get in the way of winning . Getting over yourself is n't just for players .
Ginobili was one of the first players to challenge Popovich 's sensibilities , but the coach eventually learned to accept what their 16-year guard has always told him , “ This is what I do. ” Though their once out-of-control drives appear to be slow-motion replays and they conserve their energy for when it counts , Ginobili is one of the rare perimeter players to play into their 40s and remain effective . Their teammates call them “ grandpa juice ” for the life Ginobili injects into the game at an advanced age . Ginobili is playing more minutes now than they did in their final two seasons in their 30s — a spike in playing time that will change once Leonard returns . But they have already provided motivation for Gay .
“ I have a little bit of a rejuvenation , because I understand I have a 40-year-old teammate . I feel like I have a couple more good years in this system , ” Gay told Yahoo Sports with a laugh . “ It 's just the knowledge in the room . Pau Gasol was my vet when I was a rookie . Manu , Tony , all these guys have been through some battles . Being around them , I feel like I 'm still learning . It 's fun . ”
Mills had been rejected by Portland before arriving in San Antonio , and it was n't long before they were hitting big shots in the NBA Finals and earning a $ 50 million contract last summer . The Spurs have n't been waiting for Leonard to save them now because they know they 'll really need them healthy in the postseason . They were able to ruin the Rockets in a close-out game without Leonard but stood no chance against Golden State , which outscored them by 87 points for the remainder of the series after Leonard hobbled off the floor in the second half of Game 1 of the conference finals with an ankle injury .
“ We felt like we were undermanned , ” Mills told Yahoo Sports . “ Hopefully , we can get back to that spot and we want to be healthy and have another crack at it . As competitors and athletes , we try to find something to fuel the fire and that one is a quite easy one . ”
The Spurs believe that series against the Warriors would 've at least been more compelling and possibly had a more favorable outcome with a healthy Leonard . That might sound crazy , but so does snow in South Texas , which happened last week . Leonard has missed too many games to have a chance at winning MVP , but the Spurs have set them up to help threaten Houston and Golden State in the West . One of the more unique stars in terms of demeanor and playing style , Leonard is the ax the Spurs will have to wield in order to chop down other elite teams in the postseason . Maybe those flannel shirts were in anticipation that they will soon start swinging for something even greater .

The father of Spc . Ivan Lopez , the Fort Hood gunman , said Friday that their son “ must not have been in their right mind . ”
The Lopez family said in a statement that the recent deaths of Lopez 's mother and grandfather and a base transfer “ surely affected their existing condition because of their experiences as a soldier . ”
Lopez 's grandfather died in October and their mother in November . In February , they were transferred to Fort Hood from Fort Bliss , elsewhere in Texas . Lopez was being treated for anxiety and depression and evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder .
The family 's statement :
Facing the tragedy that occurred on April 2 in Fort Hood , TX , the family of the Puerto Rican soldier Iván López is concerned and asks for prayers for those affected and deceased by the unfortunate incidents . Iván López , father of the soldier , is still in shock and described their son as a calm family man , a young worker who always looked out for the well being of their home and a good son . `` This situation has caused great pain . I ask for prayers for the affected families , even more so when there is still an ongoing investigation . My son must not have been in their right mind , they are n't like that , '' said Iván López , Sr.As an active soldier they defended the nation and received medals . They also worked honorably as a police officer on the island . According to their father , the soldier was under medical treatment and the passing of their mother , their grandfather and the recent changes when transferring to the base surely affected their existing condition because of their experiences as a soldier . No more comments shall be made during the investigation conducted by authorities .

( CBS News ) It happened this week : The passing of an inventor whose handiwork is in millions of homes and offices . . . maybe even yours .
Doug Engelbart died Tuesday at their California home , roughly 49 years after creating the computer accessory known as the Mouse .
In an interview many years later , Engelbart showed off their original , made in 1964 as part of an experiment -- a wood-encased mouse , or `` X-Y Position Indicator For A Display System , '' as it was called at the time .
`` It was no great shakes , the invention , '' Engelbart said . `` It was just putting together things that were already known . So that 's how we got the first mouse . ''
Their modest assessment understated the sensation the mouse created when they showed it off for the very first time at a computer conference in 1968 .
`` I do n't know why we call it a mouse , '' they said . As it moves up or down , so does the tracking spot .
During this 1968 demonstration , Douglas Engelbart explained how a cursor point would track the movements of a mouse made by the computer 's operator . SRI
Engelbart won a patent for their mouse in 1970 . . . but they never made a fortune off it . By the time the mouse became commonplace in the late 1980s , their patent 's 17-year-life span had expired .
At least one billion mice -- or is it `` mouses '' ? -- have been sold worldwide to date . But with changing technology , its future is hardly guaranteed .
After all , when the Starship Enterprise crew time-traveled to the 20th century from the 23rd , in the 1986 film `` Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home , '' the mouse-equipped PC left them stumped :
Scotty ( speaking into mouse ) `` Hello , computer ! ''
Tech guy : `` Just use the keyboard . ''
Scotty : `` A keyboard ? How quaint . ''
That the mouse would eventually fade away would hardly have surprised its inventor . `` It 's hard to believe it wo n't someday be obsolete , '' Engelbart once said . `` Everybody sort of thinks we 're there , and we 're just a little ways up a hill . There 's * this * much to go . Let 's get going ! ''
Douglas Engelbart was 88 .

The Recovery Blueprint is a multipart series of articles that offers suggestions on how to recover from the homebuilding recession .
Since the recession began , there have n't been any significant changes in how regulations could be improved to energize the housing market and foster innovation . Three areas where big regulation changes are needed ? Environmental subsidies , density requirements , and zoning laws .
Environmental Incentives : Repeating the mistakes of the Carter era , federal and state governments have thrown vast sums of tax money at ‘ green ' solutions likely to fail . A massive amount of our nation 's total energy use seeps out of inefficient housing , draining families of income at a time when they can least afford it . The subsidization of inefficient construction that incorporates energy saving alternatives is as flawed today as it was 25 years ago . Federal and state credits allow funding for improvements such as insulation , solar panels , wind generation , geothermal systems , and the like . These tax credits have to be balanced against taxes paid by families who are barely surviving this recession , if they are still in their homes making mortgage payments .
Who benefits ? Not the mortgage companies that repossess energy inefficient homes . Not the families in traditional homes burdened with high energy costs . Only those wealthy enough to need tax breaks can benefit . But a household at the income level where it makes financial sense to upgrade an existing home can easily afford the upgrade without burdening the already overtaxed public .
In a low income , possibly downtrodden neighborhood , upgrading a home for energy efficiency results in an expense ( even after tax breaks ) not likely to be recovered at the sale of the home . It would make more sense to use the same amount of funds to replace older , inefficient homes with new construction . New construction essentially replaces homes with the least efficient HVAC ( heating/ventilation/ air conditioning ) and insulation with new ones that operate the most efficient systems . But new construction gets almost no tax benefits ; only geothermal or solar systems on new construction are subsidized . Does that make sense ?
Density Targets : Making funds available to cities on the condition that certain higher densities are met is not a solution , either . What I hear most often is that we need to provide high-density housing and public transportation so that poor people can get to their jobs , assuming , of course , that all people of low income work downtown .
Are multi-billion dollar light rail projects and heavily subsidized low-income high-rise towers justified by such rhetoric ? A low-income family on the 6th floor of a high-density building will not have the same quality of living or the pride-of-place that a home with a yard would provide . Travel dependent on a train or bus schedule does not offer the independence of owning a vehicle and travelling on one 's own schedule . Travel by foot or bike makes perfect sense for some of those who live in San Diego , but in the rest of the world those alternatives are viable only for the few nice weather days .
When the recession began , urban architects and planners celebrated the death of the suburbs and the coming advent of an urban rebirth . While the suburbs were certainly hard hit , urban areas did not receive the expected mass migration .
There is a myth that sprawl was the result of large lots and low density in the suburbs . Over the past 20 years , the firm I founded has planned over 730 developments in 46 States and 15 countries . I would estimate the average density of our suburban developments at between four and five units per useable acre . Today 's suburban development must preserve wetlands , steep slopes , wooded areas , and most often contain a minimum percentage of the site in open space . None of those requirements were in place when our core cities were built . One simply gridded streets through swamps ( the previous term for wetlands ) and bulldozed slopes and woodlands . Had our existing core cities been built under today 's regulations , they would likely sprawl 30 % or more beyond the areas they currently occupy .
Density targets that must be hit in order to receive government financial assistance not only does n't increase the quality of lower income life , it does n't result in more sustainable and affordable cities . Instead , most funding has resulted in displacing low-income neighborhoods with gentrified , wealthy development . Many of these projects were initial financial failures . The next developer — the one who picked up the project at bargain prices — realized the profit . Successful , affordable urban redevelopment remains elusive .
Ordinances & Codes : The designer of any development , suburban or urban , will squeeze every inch out of the site to stay within the most minimal dimensions allowed by local ordinances . This effort to maximize the client 's profits can only result in monotonous , cookie-cutter development .
Many city planning boards have been manipulated into believing the illusion that a ‘ forms based ' or ‘ smart-code ' approach is a solution . These new regulations simply increase the number of minimum standards , and restrict innovative solutions . What a ‘ forms based ' or ‘ smart ' code does accomplish is to significantly increase the consulting income of the firm that promotes this alternative .
Many engineers and architects base their fees on a percentage of the final construction costs . A consultant who charges on a percentage of infrastructure costs has an incentive to introduce excessive sewer pipes , retaining walls , or other non-needed construction . A fee structure based upon increased profit derived on the least efficient design is a huge roadblock to developing sustainable cities .
Innovations in land development and in methods of design now allow a reduction of both environmental and economic impact from 15 % to over 50 % , compared to conventional or New Urban planning methods . While these new methods take more time and effort to design , the reward is more attractive , affordable , and functional neighborhoods .
What 's the blueprint for better planning ? For starters , two ideas : government aid should be based on a ‘ plan ' showing how the resulting development will enhance the living standards , and not be tied only to density levels . And agencies should reward contracts to the consultant with the best solution . This means creating a financial mechanism to increase – not decrease — profitability for sustainable planning and engineering solutions that require the least amount of construction costs .

BEAVERTON -- The Oregonian sat down with former Oregon Ducks quarterback and current NFL free agent Dennis Dixon on Saturday at `` The Opening , '' the premiere , invitation-only high school football camp at the Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton .
`` The Opening '' features three days of training and 7-on-7 drills for the top 150 prep players from around the country in the class of 2013 . Many NFL stars are on campus to help coach the players .
Q : What do you think of `` The Opening '' ?
A : It 's something that you can see the best athletes around the country competing in 7-on-7 and get communication and camaraderie amongst each other . It 's actually good to see because around my time we did n't have this .
Q : All these kids at `` The Opening '' have one more year of high school and then they are off to college . What advice do you have for them ?
A : Just soak everything in . Take your ( college ) visits , for sure . You never know what 's out there . Everything presents itself in a different way . Just take it with open arms and seize the moment .
Q : What do you think of the 7-on-7 drills ?
A : I think it 's a perfectly good tool , for someone like myself as far as a quarterback to see what you can get away with in some of these situations . So when a game comes , you dare not to do that ... Communication between a receiver and a quarterback goes a long way and it goes along with running backs and tight ends , so 7-on-7 is very valuable for someone like myself .
Q : Do you still come back to Oregon quite a bit ?
A : Yes , I do . I actually do train here . I 'm here a lot in the offseason . I bounce back and forth between here and California .
Q : Where are you from originally ?
A : Oakland , California .
Q : Did you like your time with the Ducks ?
A : I did . It was a good four years . I would n't trade it for the world . A lot of good people are around my circle and I 'm truly blessed . The university gave me a lot of opportunities .
Q : How old are you now ?
A : 27 .
Q : How tall are you ?
A : 6-foot-4 .
Q : You were last with the Pittsburgh Steelers . What 's the plan moving forward ?
A : Right now I 'm a free agent . There are a lot of teams out there that are probably interested . Right now I 'm just trying to coordinate that with me and my agent and see what the options are . As of right now , people are trying to go to training camp and feel what they have and then after that , I should be getting calls .
Q : Down the road , what do you see yourself doing ?
A : I can see myself doing something like coaching maybe . Or something involved with Nike as far as being hands-on with the athletes . I can be the eyes and the ears because I 've been there , done that . I can see myself still playing baseball , too . There 's a whole bunch of options out there right now . Do n't really want to focus on that right now , I want to be able to focus on football and see where that takes me .
Q : You were drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in 2003 . Did you ever seriously consider playing baseball ?
A : I did , at one point . As far as high school , I wanted to get my degree , so that 's why I did n't pursue it as far as the Cincinnati Reds , but I did get drafted again my junior year in college to the Atlanta Braves . I actually pursued a summer with them and tried the whole summer league before I had to get back for my senior year . I kind of liked it but I had to get back to my senior year .
Q : What position did you play ?
A : Right field .
Q : Do you miss baseball ?
A : I do a little bit . I 'll be honest with you . I can still see myself out there in right field throwing those assists , throwing people out and everything .
Q : What did you think of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly reportedly nearly leaving the Ducks for the NFL ?
A : He 's a true players coach . I mean , he 's down to earth . He 's an offensive guru . They want everything fine-tuned . And he 's always open for advice as far as players go and getting them in the right position . They use your tools with the utmost respect and gives you an opportunity to go out there and seize the moment .
Q : Do you keep in touch with any of your teammates from your time with the Ducks ?
A : I do . I do . Some that are in the league right now , as well as some that are working for Nike as we speak right now . My circle is small , but at the same time it 's big , if that makes sense . I still stay involved with a lot of people .

Snap Inc. stock soared another 11 % to top $ 27 Friday after rocketing higher in its market debut the day before , but a wave of analyst initiations Friday show Wall Street does n't think Snap is worth the price .
In the past day since Snap 's SNAP , -0.40 % market debut , there have been at least six coverage initiations from brokerages on Wall Street . Morningstar initiated coverage with a $ 15 fair value on the stock , Pivotal Research initiated with a selling rating and $ 10 target , Instinet initiated with a reduced rating and a $ 16 rating , Atlantic Equities initiated with a hold rating and $ 14 target , Aegis Capital initiated with a $ 22 target and SIG Susquehanna initiated with a neutral rating and $ 22 target .

Altogether , those ratings and targets average out to the equivalent of a sell rating and a price target of $ 16.50 , 50 cents less than Snap 's $ 17 IPO listing price . Snap shares opened at $ 24 a share in late-morning trade Thursday after the largest U.S. IPO since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. 's BABA , +0.16 % in 2014 . They closed up 10.6 % to $ 27.09 on Friday , after soaring as much as 19 % earlier in the session .
Much of the bearish sentiment stems from the belief on Wall Street that Snapchat is currently overvalued . Pivotal 's Brian Wieser said Snap is “ significantly overvalued , ” despite being a “ promising early stage company with significant opportunity ahead of itself. ” Even their $ 10 target , which implies a $ 16 billion valuation , seems “ stretched ” at the moment , they said .
Wieser pointed to a number of “ significant risks ” that could potentially offset some of Snap 's growth opportunities , including competition “ from much larger companies , ” decelerating user growth and the company 's unusual stock structure that leaves the vast majority of voting power in the founders ' hands . While Snapchat added 50 million daily active users in 2016 , the growth sharply slowed in the third and fourth quarters of the year , around the time that Facebook Inc. 's FB , -0.30 % Instagram launched a feature called Stories that is similar to popular Snapchat offering of the same name .
Instinet 's Anthony DiClemente cited similar reasons for their bearish rating , pointing specifically to competition from Facebook , Instagram and WhatsApp , all Facebook properties . Snapchat turned down a $ 3 billion acquisition offer by Facebook in 2013 .
Graphic embed is no longer available .
“ We believe much of the slowdown is being driven by increased competition , i.e. , the launch of Instagram Stories in August 2016 , ” said DiClemente . “ A slower user growth trajectory in the present naturally limits upside in Snap 's revenue generation in future years . ”

Sig Susquehanna 's Shyam Patil said the euphoria surrounding the IPO may cause a “ short-term disconnect between fundamentals and valuation. ” Snapchat reported a loss of $ 514.6 million in 2016 , wider than the $ 372.9 million loss it reported in 2015 , as its $ 404.5 million in revenue was offset by much higher costs .
“ We would n't be surprised to see euphoria take the stock into the high $ 20s to low $ 30s , ” said Patil . “ But longer-term , we struggle to see Snap as an investment with meaningful upside potential from current levels . ”
Snap shares were up 3.8 % early Monday . The S & P 500 SPX , -0.08 % was down 0.5 % .

Update : I still had a few questions about this helmet , which I asked the Royal Armouries this morning . The reply from their curators regarding the `` horned helmet ( or parade armet ) '' :
`` It is not a flattering image , and is believed to depict the fool , a popular figure in court pageants , hence the wrinkles , stubble , dripping nose , etc . There has been much debate as to whether the horns and glasses are original or later additions . Henry VIII may have occasionally worn glasses like these , but probably not horns , as this was the sign for a cuckold . Basically it is a bit of an enigma with scholarly debate still raging ! Hope that helps a little – though it 's still a mystery . ''

Bitmixer 's Exit and Darknet Market Chaos : How Monero Stands to Benefit
The swift takedown of the darknet markets ( DNMs ) AlphaBay and Hansa , an announcement to exit the market from Bitmixer and the arrest of Alexander Vinnik for laundering $ 4 billion have all shown that fungibility is still an area for improvement for Bitcoin . As bitcoin shakes off its shady image , Monero has drawn increased attention . The privacy-focused cryptocurrency experienced an outburst over July 26 , peaking at $ 46.99 .
Bitmixer Announces Intention to Exit the Market
Not long after the two largest DNMs get taken down , the largest bitcoin mixer goes offline . Mixing services attempt to negate the public blockchain and provide anonymity . With the largest DNMs infiltrated , the exit of Bitmixer brings additional risk to using bitcoin for illicit purposes as it raises the question of whether mixing services are even safe anymore . The July 24 bitcointalk announcement from Bitmixer read :
“ Hi all ! Despite the huge profit we earn , we are closing our activity . Let me explain why . I 'm bitcoin enthusiast since 2011 . When we started this service I was convinced that any Bitcoin user has a natural right to privacy . I was totally wrong . Now I grasped that Bitcoin is transparent non-anonymous system by design . Blockchain is a great open book . I believe that Bitcoin will have a great future without dark market transactions . You may use Dash or Zerocoin if you want to buy some weed . Not Bitcoin . I hope our decision will help to make Bitcoin ecosystem more clean and transparent . I hope our competitors will hear our message and will close their services too . Very soon this kind of activity will be considered as illegal in most of the countries . Cheers , Bitmixer.IO ”
Bitcoin is having an image makeover it seems , courtesy of the U.S. federal government . Bitmixer 's announcement could be connected to AlphaBay , and perhaps operated as its internal mixer , as some forum members speculate . Or the mixing service may have been controlled by authorities the whole time , allowing them to unmask people sending their bitcoins to the site . Or the owner could have been under pressure from authorities ; one bitcointalk user ‘ 1blockologist ' questioned the statement , mainly because they recommended severely flawed privacy options , dash and zerocoin , and made no mention of Monero , which would be the best advice given to people who want privacy :
“ guys , OP ca n't admit it but they are under duress . This is as obvious as it gets and this is their form of warrant canary . OP specifically mentioned those honeypot coin alternatives to simultaneously aid law enforcement create new investigations on users that do n't catch on , as well as make it obvious as code words for their duress .
OP did n't say Zerocash , which has the optional opaque feature although nobody uses it properly . OP said Zerocoin . OP did n't say Monero , which would stifle all law enforcement effort . In fact , no mention of cryptonote technology at all… ”
A beneficiary of the crackdown on DNM 's and illicit activities with bitcoin is the cryptocurrency monero ( XMR ) . A brief history of Monero can be found here , and its blockchain is based on a different codebase than Bitcoin , the CryptoNote protocol . With Bitcoin , everyone can see your public address , how much funds you have and when you send funds to another address .
Conversely , with Monero , the funds you own are not associated with your public address , and when money is sent to your public address , a one-time address is created . Using this ‘ stealth address , ' only the participants on the transactions can check the blockchain , with a secret view key . To combat the sender of the original transaction seeing the recipient 's use of the same funds afterward , Ring Signatures are used . The result , everyone appears to be transacting with everyone all of the time , and no one can deduce balances , the origin of funds , destinations or the transactions of others .
Bitcoin is Shaking off its Shady Image
Whatever the reason for Bitmixer 's exit from the market , it is clear that there is an attempt underway for bitcoin to shake off its shady image permanently . No longer is it used exclusively for DNMs as both markets evolve .
Mainstream media is also used as a tool of the authorities , and they have used it to great effect with the speed of the successive takedowns and the eventual statement from the US Department of Justice on July 20 , in the midst of the ongoing chaos in the cyber-realm . It is the first time such a coordinated effort has been undertaken internationally , and it managed to take down two of the largest DNMs . No longer can you use bitcoin safely to purchase from DNMs , at least that 's what the mainstream media is trying to make people think , but it has exposed an area for improvement ; fungibility . And expect the media to play on this fact , perhaps overemphasizing it to scare vendors and buyers away .
But is it with bitcoin where the fault lies ? If used correctly , it can be changelling for an identity to be linked to a bitcoin address . Some theorize that Tor itself may have been exploited somehow while others blame weak security procedures by the operators of sites such as AlphaBay . What matters is privacy and the fungibility of money ; it is becoming increasingly clear that governments will direct a large , resourceful effort against DNMs and have made it clear no one can hide on the dark net . They could potentially capitalize on this to crackdown on other ‘ undesirable ' behavior on the Bitcoin network , such as political activism , in the future .
While the recent offensive against DNMs are blamed on Fentanyl sales , this is questionable and may be another media tactic . Consider the freedom of choice it gives to individuals , the huge amounts of money that 's exchanged hands without being taxed and the very idea this is done all under their nose without them having any control , it is safe to assume your government does not approve . Of course , the DNMs themselves also deserve some of the blame , especially for not banning harmful and destructive products such as Fentanyl . What is clear is one thing ; to survive , DNMs must change many aspects of their operations .
Also , large resources are being directed toward unraveling the features of bitcoin that make it attractive as private money , namely pseudonymity , with DNMs not experiencing the type of scrutiny they once were able to steer clear of by using a little-understood innovation . Now that bitcoin is here to stay , an entire industry has cropped up using blockchain analytics to help fight crime , which paves the way for further monero adoption . An interesting graphic presented by the Economist suggests a frequent , underlying ‘ boom-bust ' cycle for DNMs . By late 2018 , we could have a whole new wave of marketplaces based solely on Monero .
The Outlook for XMR-USD
With the successive bitcoin stories floating in the media , such as DNM takedowns and the BTC-e money laundering case , monero has caught the attention of users of the anonymous forum 4chan . But the cryptocurrency is not just in the spotlight within the underground , but also the mainstream . Even the large publication Forbes mentioned monero in recent days with a July 26 article , which revealed that MetaStable , a hedge fund with support from Polychain Capital backers Andreessen Horowitz , Union Square Ventures and others , owns around $ 6 million worth of XMR , which comprises of around one percent of the outstanding supply .
Even if you do not engage in any criminal activity , privacy is still important . For example , if you are a businessperson , using a public ledger will hamper you in negotiations , as suppliers will be able to see the prices you have been paying . Civil asset forfeiture is becoming an increasing concern in the US . Anti-terrorism laws increasingly poach the privacy of ordinary people .
On July 25 prior to the Forbes article , XMR-USD fell from $ 45 to test support around $ 37 only to rise again to a fresh high of $ 46.99 on July 26 . The 4-hour price action below shows that the conversion line ( blue ) is trending higher and provides the first support and a potential entry point for buy positions . The Ichimoku cloud also provides a support zone between $ 40.90 and $ 36.20 .
XMR-USD has remained out of equilibrium since July 11 , as shown in the daily chart below , but has since returned to the Ichimoku cloud , suggesting a breakout is imminent . A breakout to the upside is more convincing given the recent change in fundamentals for monero . The privacy issue is becoming real and rising to the surface for bitcoin , and widespread adoption of monero on DNMs looks more likely in the future , where multi-sig implementation will speed this process up . Furthermore , at least one hedge fund has dipped their toes into XMR ; imagine the potential of this cryptocurrency if you take into account the money that flows into offshore tax havens .
The chart below shows that the price action for July 27 has remained within the Ichimoku cloud , suggesting a calm period before a breakout . We look to buy at the lower span of the Ichimoku cloud , which has provided support today at $ 43.60 on the Kraken exchange . The lower span is horizontal and provides support to August 2 . We also look for an Ichimoku breakout , that is a daily close above the cloud , ( $ 46.98 for July 27 , $ 46.86 for July 28 , $ 45.47 for July 29 , etc . ) to target the most recent fractal resistance at $ 51.35 as an initial target .
We have two indications that bullish momentum has just started to dominate . Firstly , the conversion line ( blue ) has crossed above the baseline ( red ) , giving an indication that bearish momentum has been exhausted . Secondly , we see that the Awesome Oscillator gave a bullish signal on July 25 , when the indicator moved into positive territory for the first time since June 26 .
The speed at which recent events such as AlphaBay , Bitmixer , and Btc-e have unfolded consecutively in the Bitcoin space have come as a surprise to most . It is beneficial for bitcoin to become a legitimized cryptocurrency and to leave its shady past behind ; no longer can it be labelled as a currency just for criminals . As stated by BITCRIME 's Dr. Paulina Pesch in an interview in February 2017 :
“ If criminals move to other cryptocurrencies like Monero , we separate legal and criminal systems and users . ”
While on the surface , it may seem like doom and gloom for bitcoin and cryptocurrency with darknet and money laundering busts , the separation of legal and criminal systems within the crypto-world may be unfolding in front of our eyes .
CEDAR RAPIDS — One of Cedar Rapids ' oldest hotels may soon be no more .
Cedar Rapids city staff is recommending a $ 5 million buyout of Best Western Cooper 's Mill so the property can be part of a planned flood protection system .
“ Giving the river room to breathe , that is kind of what this does , ” said Rob Davis , the city 's flood control program manager .
The Cedar Rapids Flood Control Committee is to be briefed on the recommended acquisition during a meeting at 10 a.m. Tuesday at the Five Seasons Conference Room in the City Services Center Building , 500 15th Ave. SW .
Built in 1972 , Cooper 's Mill sits close to the west bank of the Cedar River at 90 F Ave. NW . The hotel closed in preparation for the recent flooding . The 82-room hotel , restaurant and bar sustained significant damage in the 2008 flood .
The hotel remains closed and is likely to not reopen if Cedar Rapids City Council approves the buyout at its Oct. 11 meeting , Davis said .
The Gazette was unable to reach Doug DeLong , the hotel 's owner , for comment .
“ There 's a possibility that Cooper 's Mill will be no longer , ” said Ralph Russell , a City Council member and head of the flood committee .
Russell said they are aware of the negotiations and that city officials were considering whether to try to protect or demolish the building . They expect to learn the latest details at Tuesday 's meeting .
The city investigated what 's called a flowage easement , in which the hotel could stay and the city would pay to allow the property to take on floodwater , Davis said .
Ultimately , the cost is about the same as a buyout , they added . Because the cost difference is negligible , city policy requires the buyout , Davis said .
Davis plans to bring up for discussion at the committee meeting whether flowage easement appraisals are wise . Buyouts have proved in Cedar Rapids and elsewhere to be about the same price as easements , and the buyout eliminates liability of having a building in use so close to the flood system , they said .
Some cities only allow flowage easements for agricultural property , Davis said .
“ Based on our sampling and looking at what other cities have done , it would appear in the vicinity of levees an easement is really not practical , ” Davis said .
The flood protection system master plan calls for a levee at the edge of the Cooper 's Mill property in the five- to 10-year time frame , Davis said . Having more land to help hold rising floodwater is the main driver in the acquisition , they said .
Hotel officials have agreed to what is called a “ voluntary early acquisition , ” which means they 've agreed to sell the property now versus waiting until construction of a levee is imminent , Davis said .
“ They are onboard with it , ” they said .
Officials from the city and Cooper 's Mill have been discussing the buyout since the spring when hotel officials approached the city , Davis said . The recent flooding event had little to do with the decision , they added .
The price tag includes the property , structure and fixtures , Davis said . The plan is to demolish the building , likely next spring , they added .
This is the second buyout in recent months .

The city acquired the nearby Hubbard Ice building , also known as Hubbard Industrial Park , 1124 First St. NW , for $ 2.5 million in July . The city is relocating the tenants over the next six to 10 months before demolition , Davis said .
The money for the acquisitions comes from the state 's Growth Reinvestment Initiative — or GRI — that allows cities to use sales tax revenue to pay for flood mitigation projects .
Cooper 's Mill and Hubbard Ice were eligible for a federally-funded property buyout program following the 2008 flood , but they did n't exercise that option , and the program ended , Davis said .
Last weekend , Natasha , Pierre , and the Great Comet of 1812 — Dave Malloy 's electro-pop adaptation of Tolstoy 's War and Peace — closed on Broadway after a casting controversy : The show 's producers had asked the male lead , Hamilton 's Okieriete “ Oak ” Onaodowan , who is black , to step aside early to “ make room ” for the more established ( and white ) Mandy Patinkin , who later withdrew from the production after social media backlash . It was an ignominious end for one of the most exciting musicals of recent decades — one that reimagined Tolstoy 's epic classic for a new generation .
During its run — at least , until its final weeks — the show drew plenty of praise for its treatment of race : The production 's color-blind approach to casting meant that actors of color played roles , including both the titular Natasha and Pierre , normally reserved for white actors .
But less appreciated , though no less vital , was the nuanced and skillful way the show handled religion , treating questions of faith and doubt with as much gravity as more concrete questions of romantic attachment .
Comet 's central relationship is between Pierre and God — and it works
When I interviewed the show 's writer/composer ( and original Pierre ) Dave Malloy for the Village Voice last year , Malloy told me that the entire structure of Comet was designed to allow the show to parallel the story of the young Russian countess , Natasha , whose infidelity destroys their relationship with their absent fiancé Prince Andrei , with that of Andrei 's morose and disillusioned friend Pierre , looking for a way out from their existential malaise among the high society of Napoleon-era Moscow .
In a section of our interview that was edited down for length , Malloy talked about how a “ traditional ” romantic musical would have an “ A ” couple and a “ B ” couple , each of whose stories would complement the other . ( Think , for example , of Guys and Dolls , where the more earnest relationship between Sky Masterson and Sarah is paralleled by the comic relationship between Nathan Detroit and Adelaide ) . But , Malloy said , the “ romance ” on Pierre 's side is n't between Pierre and another person , but between Pierre and God ( or the universe , or the big something , or whatever you want to call it ) .
The musical 's tight structure , which veers between Natasha 's romantic misdeeds with the dashing but ultimately selfish Anatole and Pierre 's increasingly futile attempts to “ wake up ” from their unhappy life , intensifies our sense that Pierre 's quest for fulfillment is no less valid than Natasha 's , despite their far less “ sexy ” plot line . But it also makes clear that the very thing Pierre is looking for — a sense of meaning and order to their life — is , to some extent , what Natasha is looking for , too .
When Natasha finally succumbs to Anatole 's charms , they do so because the narrative of the two of them as star-crossed lovers ( rather than two people who just want to sleep together ) helps them make sense of them otherwise fractured and conflicting emotions . “ But I love you/Of that there is no doubt/How else could all of this have happened ? ” Natasha sings , 'How else could we have kissed ? /It means that I have loved you from the first/It means that you are kind , noble , and splendid/And I could not help loving you . ”
In a telling moment in the show 's opening sequence , the cast veers from a comic song introducing the numerous ( and confusingly named ) Russian characters by their attributes — Natasha is young , their cousin Sonia is good , their fiancé “ is n't here ” — to a much more nuanced one . “ What about Pierre ? ” they ask . Pierre , it seems , can not be explained in a single word , so they get a whole song to soliloquize about how they “ can not go on/living as I do. ” Pierre is complicated and raw , contradictory : as lazy and self-indulgent as they are motivated by a desire for real change .
But as the show progresses , we learn that none of our characters can really be summed up in a word . Natasha may be “ young ” at the show 's opening , but by the time she 's screwed up not one but two romantic relationships , she 's an ingénue no longer , and she , too , has to deal with what it means to be a complicated , flawed , human being , living in the world without easy answers .
It 's fitting , then , that the climax of Comet is n't a great dramatic scene — a reconciliation , a duel , a kiss — but a tiny , tender moment between the titular characters , in which Pierre reassures Natasha that they are worthy of forgiveness : that they have their “ whole life ahead of you. ” Pierre has gotten out of their head for once , and Natasha is able to engage with a man not as an idealized , romantic notion of what they want , but as a fellow traveler on their road toward self-discovery .
Indeed , the show 's climax is an anti-climax . As the famous comet of 1812 crosses the sky in the show 's final number , Pierre finds relief in how they do not fear it : `` The comet said to portend Untold horrors/And the end of the world/But for me/the comet brings no fear/No , I gaze joyfully . ”
That 's not to say that Comet is n't gorgeously romantic . Of course it is . But its romance is ultimately less about resolving a “ marriage plot ” — by the show 's end , nobody 's paired off happily — than exploring the undercurrent of what makes us want to love at all . It may not be “ religion ” in the traditional sense ( although a mystical Christianity lies at the heart of Tolstoy 's novel ) , but Malloy and Tolstoy alike challenge the audience to ask what , once our illusions have been shattered , we still can have faith in .
Amazon has just responded to Google 's decision to remove YouTube from all Fire TV products and the Echo Show . “ Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website , ” a spokesperson told The Verge by email . “ We hope to resolve this with Google as soon as possible. ” YouTube is being pulled from the Show effective immediately , and Fire TV owners will lose out on the popular , essential video streaming app on January 1st .
Google says it 's taking this extreme step because of Amazon 's recent delisting of new Nest products ( like Nest Secure and the E Thermostat ) and the company 's long-running refusal to sell Chromecast or support Google Cast in any capacity .
But regardless of the public stance each company takes over the next few days , it 's their mutual customers who are unfairly getting jerked around . YouTube is a cornerstone of any living room streaming device , and for Google to suddenly decide to strip it from millions of existing Fire TV owners — assuming no agreement is reached by January 1st — is shameful . YouTube is video on the internet . Period . It 's also home to beloved creators , and Google 's decision will soon rob them of viewers .
Losing YouTube will almost certainly have a negative impact on Fire TV sales
Kicking the Echo Show to the curb does n't impact nearly as many people , but it still stings since watching cooking videos from YouTube on the Alexa screen in your kitchen seemed like one of the perfect uses for the thing ! But since Google is being pedantic and needlessly obsessive over every detail of how the app functions on Amazon 's device , that 's no longer possible . This is the second time YouTube has disappeared from the Show . Google said the first iteration had a “ broken user experience , ” which resulted in a revised version that was basically the full-blown desktop website . That 's not exactly ideal from a usability standpoint .
“ Echo Show and Fire TV now display a standard web view of YouTube.com and point customers directly to YouTube 's existing website , ” the Amazon spokesperson said . But sources familiar with Google 's position say the company takes issue with Amazon overlaying its own voice controls on top of YouTube . That violates section 4b of YouTube 's terms of service , which reads “ you agree not to alter or modify any part of the service . ”
THIS IS INSANITY pic.twitter.com/dYbi5w7pdD — dan seifert of the house verge , first of their name ( @ dcseifert ) November 21 , 2017
Google is dealing Amazon 's devices real damage by withdrawing YouTube , and you could reasonably argue it has the upper hand here . There are people who simply wo n't buy a Fire TV as a result of this move , and many existing owners will be displeased come January . Actually , they 're already rather upset since YouTube is displaying a cold , matter-of-fact warning about the cutoff starting today — and gently pushing users towards other devices . If you follow that link , there 's no explanation given as to why a device you paid money for will suddenly be made worse when the calendar hits 2018 .
So Google 's feud with Amazon just reached my living room . Got this screen when I launched YouTube on my Amazon Fire TV . pic.twitter.com/vtmcuBTtE9 — Cornell Ngare ( @ cngare_ ) December 5 , 2017
Amazon is n't without fault either . The company dragged its feet for years in releasing a proper Prime Video app for Android in the Google Play Store . That only happened earlier this year . Previously , you had to install Amazon 's own , separate app store and only then could you install Prime Video . It was a sad , convoluted attempt at luring users to the Amazon Appstore . Even now , Prime Video still does n't support Chromecast , as Google points out .
Google 's complaints about Amazon are all valid
And that 's directly tied to Chromecast 's absence on Amazon.com . Since there 's no easy way of watching Prime Video , Amazon wo n't sell it . But it 's Amazon 's own fault that Prime Video does n't work with Chromecast . Amazon has the power to make it happen . What 's Google supposed to do in this scenario ?
Even to casual observers , Amazon 's decision to remove popular , well-liked products from its store over this spat — or never sell them to begin with — is an ugly example of the company throwing its weight and power around . No one should be surprised that Google is crying foul . Is the company under any obligation to sell Google Home — the chief rival to its own Echo ? Of course not . I 's the breaks . But the Chromecast situation is troubling , and Amazon 's recent halting of sales for certain Nest hardware ( with no real explanation ) seems juvenile . Prime shipping is still a very powerful incentive , and Amazon is well aware of that .
What frustrates me most is that neither of these companies have bothered to apologize to customers over their squabbling . There 's no “ we 're sorry to everyone affected. ” On YouTube 's end , it 's just an abrupt , indifferent “ Hey , you 're losing YouTube ! ” message to Fire TV owners . Google says “ we hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon. ” Business terms take priority and customers come second . There 's no other way of looking at this or framing it . No one 's fighting for some greater good .
We 're witnessing the worst kind of petty bickering from two tech giants , and consumers are taking the brunt of this escalating feud . If that 's not embarassing enough , the companies are already being mocked by industry groups in favor of dismantling net neutrality . USTelecom wasted little time in piling on . “ Broadband ISPs are committed to providing an open internet for their customers , including protections like no content blocking or throttling , ” CEO Jonathan Spalter said . “ Seems like some of the biggest internet companies ca n't say the same . Ironic , is n't it ? ” This stubborn conflict is turning into fodder for FCC chairperson Ajit Pai 's supporters .
It should never have come to this . Amazon and Google , your options are to make this right , take your grievances to the FTC , or go to court . But do n't take it out on people who just want to enjoy their gadgets . Let people have their YouTube . 2017 has been hard enough to endure already .
Retailer to pay workers at least $ 10 an hour after reporting revenues of $ 482bn last year , adding billions more to wealth of family that owns half of company
The Waltons , already the wealthiest family in the US with an estimated $ 149bn fortune , added a further $ 5bn last year from dividends and share buybacks at Walmart .
The Walton family collectively owns just over half of Walmart , the world 's largest retailer which on Thursday reported it made revenues of $ 482bn in the year to the end of January . That is more than Austria , Thailand or the United Arab Emirates make in gross domestic product ( GDP ) a year , according to World Bank statistics .
Walmart disclosed its earnings to its shareholders by paying out $ 6.3bn in dividends and repurchasing $ 4.1bn worth of shares . The Waltons own nearly 54 % of Walmart so their share is worth $ 5.6bn .
The Waltons , descendants of Sam Walton , who founded Walmart as a single store in Arkansas in 1962 , are the richest family in the US , according to Forbes with a net worth of $ 149bn . The Walton fortune is almost twice as much as the country 's second-richest family the Kochs with $ 86bn .
After a long battle with its army of more than a million workers , Walmart will from Monday increase its pay to a minimum of $ 10 an hour . However , new workers will still receive $ 9 an hour until they have completed in-house training . Walmart said the increases would take average full-time workers ' wages to $ 13.38 an hour and part-time staff to $ 10.58 .
Walmart described the pay hike as “ one of the largest single-day , private-sector pay increases ever ” . But unions said many Walmart workers still wo n't be making enough money to support their families .
“ It 's easier to find a unicorn than a Walmart worker who has gotten a meaningful raise , or has n't had their hours cut , ” Jessica Levin , spokesperson of the United Food & Commercial Workers Union , which is campaigning for a $ 15-an-hour living wage , said . “ America 's hard-working families expect better from a company that makes billions in profit a year . ”
The inequity of the Waltons ' wealth compared to the hardship experienced by Walmart 's army of workers has become a talking point in the race for the White House in 2016 .
The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders , who is taking on Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination , said it was unacceptable that the Waltons have more wealth than the bottom 40 % of Americans .
“ Today Walmart is the largest private sector employer in America , ” Sanders said in campaign speech in New Hampshire earlier this month . “ Yet many , many of their employees are forced to go on food stamps , Medicaid and subsidized housing that you pay for through your taxes because the Walton family refuses to pay their workers a living wage . ”
Sanders said the Waltons were benefiting from “ the rigged economy ” in which “ the middle class pays to subsidize the wealthiest family in this country ” .
“ I say to the Walton family , get off of welfare . Pay your workers a living wage , ” they said .
According to a report from the Associated Press , six world nations recently agreed to send over a hundred tons of natural uranium to Iran .
The still-secret arrangement was made by the United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom , France , and Germany to compensate Iran for 70 tons of heavy water exported to the U.S. shortly after the Iran deal was finalized . There was also a small amount of uranium gifted to Iran then .
Natural uranium can be enriched for use in power production , but also for the use of nuclear weapons . According to one expert consulted by AP , the uranium given to Iran is enough to create ten atomic bombs . Senior diplomats say that “ Tehran has not said what it would do with the uranium , ” but they believe Iran could choose to store it .
“ The natural uranium agreement comes at a sensitive time , ” the AP notes . “ With the incoming U.S. administration and many U.S. lawmakers already skeptical of how effective the nuclear deal is in keeping Iran 's nuclear program peaceful over the long term , they might view it as further evidence that Tehran is being given too many concessions . ”

Neuroscientists have discovered that artificially stimulating a positive memory can cause mice to snap out of depression-like behaviour .
Brain cells storing a good memory were labelled and then later re-activated , after the mice were stressed .
`` Turning on '' the memory for just a few minutes eliminated signs of depression .
The research , published in Nature , can not be directly applied in humans but the researchers say it demonstrates the power of rekindling happy memories .
People with depression typically struggle to summon positive memories from before their illness , said senior author Susumu Tonegawa , from the Riken-MIT Center for Neural Circuit Genetics in Massachusetts , US .
Treatments such as psychotherapy and medication help in some cases , but not others . Prof Tonegawa hopes that one day , improved technology will allow us to stimulate positive brain activity more directly .
`` There is hope that knowledge obtained from this type of animal model study could be taken advantage of , in the future , when it is combined with less invasive technology , '' they told the BBC .
Prof Tonegawa 's team is known for its work manipulating mouse memories using the technique known as `` optogenetics '' .
This involves using genetic engineering to install a `` switch '' in particular brain cells . Once in place , these switches can be activated by shining light inside the brain .
Optogenetics : switches for brain circuits Image copyright JOHN ROGERS/SPL Developed in flies , and then mice , during the early 2000s
Now used in neuroscience labs all over the world and hotly tipped for a Nobel in the future
Allows researchers to control brain cells ( neurons ) with coloured light
Uses genetic engineering to put light-sensitive ion channels , originally found in algae , into neurons
These change the flow of electrical charge and activate or silence the neurons
To deliver the light , a thin optical fibre can be implanted into the brain
In this study it was used to switch on what researchers call the `` engram '' of a positive memory - the specific set of neurons storing the happy association
In the new study , male mice were given a female for company and the brain cells forming that positive memory were labelled . These were in the hippocampus , a brain area known for its role in memory .
Then the mice were given a stressful 10 days , with two to three hours of close confinement each day . After that , the animals displayed depression-like behaviour - such as not reacting when held by the tail , or no longer showing a preference for sweetened water ( indicating a loss of pleasure , or `` anhedonia '' ) .
Better than the real thing
Remarkably , when the happy-memory cells were reactivated with a pulsing blue light for several minutes , the mice immediately lost these `` depressive '' indicators . They behaved in the same way as a control group of mice , which had not been stressed at all .
The artificially stimulated memory appeared to function rather like an antidepressant . And with repeated doses , its effects were long-lasting : delivering the blue light pulses every day for five days caused the mice to lose their depression-like behaviour permanently , even after the light was switched off .
In an intriguing comparison , mice that were given a daily dose of the actual positive experience ( female company again ) , instead of a beam of blue light to trigger its memory , showed no such improvement .
`` This artificial activation of positive memory cells seems to be very powerful , '' Prof Tonegawa said . `` But if you just get the mouse to try to recall a positive memory with natural cues , it does n't work . ''
By contrast , the artificial memory-trigger worked `` every time '' for Prof Tonegawa 's mice . They hope that sort of consistency will one day be available for human patients , but emphasised that the technique can not be directly applied .
'Elegant experiments '
Nonetheless , the results shed more light on how the particular networks of brain cells that store memories can change behaviour .
For example , the effect of the memory stimulation appeared to be specific to depression-like symptoms . Other consequences of the stressful period did not go away ; measures of anxiety , for example , such as how long the mice voluntarily spent in the open , remained high .
`` Shining light into the hippocampus does n't seem to affect the anxiety that the mice develop after chronic stress , '' Prof Tonegawa explained . `` Anxiety appears to be handled by different parts of the brain . ''
Image copyright Steve Ramirez Image caption Cells storing a positive memory ( glowing in red ) were labelled and later artificially stimulated
Dr Amy Milton , a neuroscientist at Cambridge University , said the new findings were a noteworthy addition to the same team 's earlier work on memory storage and reactivation .
`` This is a really elegant set of experiments , '' they told BBC News . `` This is their first foray into animal models of psychiatric disorders . It 's an interesting application of what they 've done previously . ''
The most interesting aspect , Dr Milton said , was the comparison between artificial memory stimulation and a natural positive experience .
`` That 's a really interesting finding , suggesting that the direct activation of the memory is more powerful in relieving depression than actually going through the positive experience .
`` Therapeutically that 's the most encouraging finding , although I do n't think it would be possible to do this in humans . ''
They said unpicking the mechanism involved would be the next , valuable step . What is it about depression that the artificial stimulation is able to overcome ? Is it a blockage of access to the happy memories , and the stimulation blazes the trail anew - or is it perhaps a dampening of the memories ' effects elsewhere in the brain , which the stimulation kicks back into action ?
`` It would be really interesting to know why they 're seeing these effects , '' Dr Milton said .

PM Abadi : War on ISIS Has Cost Iraq More than $ 100bn

Karbala – Asharq Al-Awsat
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Saturday that over the past three years , war on ISIS had caused more than $ 100 billion worth of damage .
Speaking during their visit to Karbala on the occasion marking the annual Arbaeen commemoration of Imam Hussein , Abadi stated that damage caused by ISIS is estimated to have multiplied to over $ 100 billion , adding : `` that 's just the damage to the economy and infrastructure . ''
In 2014 , ISIS seized around third of Iraq and parts of Syria in a sweeping advance , but Iraqi forces backed by Popular Mobilization Forces ( PMF ) were able to recapture 97 percent of that .
Meanwhile , Abadi warned against escalation in the region and what could lead to the rise of takfirist terrorist groups .
The PM warned against escalation in the region for its dangerous ramifications , pointing out that Iraq is willing to help solve the issue in the region given its experience in averting this danger .
DW reported Abadi as to saying that whoever believes that countries in the region are safe from terrorism is delusional . They called for a meeting between regional leaders to ensure that such crisis will not happen again , and that `` a new generation of terrorist ideologies will not emerge '' .
Abadi explained that their recent visit to Saudi Arabia is not a courtesyو but rather for ensuring the sovereignty of Iraq , pointing out that this is the first time the kingdom had sent airplanes directly to Iraq to transport visitors .
The PM admitted that Iraq was ending ISIS ' military presence , however , a terrorist ideology is on the rise especially with the support of scare tactics on social media .
They assured : `` we have succeeded in three things : liberating the land , uniting the country , and terminating any attempt to endanger the country 's internal security . This danger still exists . ''
Abadi assured that the country is adamant on holding the elections within safe conditions and army and PMF should not be involved in the elections .
I have to confess that I was n't paying attention to the Brexit issue until after the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union . I wondered why so many folks from England had been asking me what I thought of the persuasion angle the Brexit “ Leave ” side was using . I always responded that I was n't following the topic and had no opinion .
Now we learn that the winning side of the Brexit vote was using what they call a Trump strategy of ignoring facts and appealing to emotion . The persuasion apparently worked . The “ Leave ” side won , defying both polls and expert predictions .
As regular readers know , I have been blogging for months about Trump 's powers of persuasion , and how they often ignore facts because facts are worthless for persuasion . I predicted Trump 's success thus far in the election cycle based on their tools of persuasion . And I documented their techniques as I went .
What you might not know is that I have a lot of blog readers in the United Kingdom .
So…did the winning side in the Brexit vote learn how to use Trump 's persuasion tools by reading my blog ? And does that make me directly responsible for the coming economic collapse in Europe ?
Well , probably yes , and probably no . For many months I 've been the loudest voice to say that Trump 's strategy of ignoring facts and using persuasion was a winning system . And I 'm reasonably sure my writing made it to the folks in the Brexit “ Leave ” movement . A-a-a-a-and I can be persuasive .
But I do n't think Europe will fall apart because of the Brexit vote . I base that prediction on what some of you already know as the Adams Law of Slow-Moving Disasters .
The law states that whenever humans have plenty of warning of a pending disaster , we always figure out how to avoid it . That 's why the Year 2000 Bug turned out to be no big deal . That 's why we have n't run out of oil , or food . That 's why we have n't all died in a nuclear war . If we see it coming , we get out of the way . We 're extraordinarily good at that .
Humans have enough time to figure out how to make the Brexit situation work . It will be inconvenient and unpredictable for some time , and economies hate that . But in the long run , no big problem . That 's my prediction .
But if I 'm wrong , and the Brexit vote destroys Great Britain and Europe because of my Trump blogging , please do n't add that accomplishment to my Wikipedia page . It 's already bad enough .

It 's hard to describe what the inside of Alexandra Savior 's brain looks like , but they suppose there 's a lot of velvet . Listening to their debut album , Belladonna of Sadness , you can imagine there might be a few dimly lit hallways , scarlet-hued walls , a creepy parlor filled with omniscient stone-faced characters… and a gun positioned perilously on a side table .
The up-and-coming singer-songwriter has never been fully able to explain these visions to those who work with them Since signing to Columbia Records in 2013 after getting noticed for their YouTube covers , they were presented with the opportunity to go to songwriting camp in London . Savior , who goes by their first and middle name ( her last name is McDermott ) , took the chance , turning down art school , but admits that they did n't learn much from their new songwriting partners . In fact , they could n't find any who could catch them drift . “ I think I just learned that I needed to do it myself , ” Savior says on the phone from their hometown of Portland , Oregon . Them brother 's by their side , and they 're waiting for the interview to be over so they can go antique shopping . “ It was like I had a disease and I was going to all these doctors and wanted them to cure me and like , none of them understood what my symptoms were . It was like I was hopping around day to day to a different place trying to explain what I was trying to convey . It was like going on blind dates. ” London turned into Los Angeles , and their label finally brought in Arctic Monkeys ' Alex Turner , who took an interest in their demos . Again , Savior was skeptical . “ I do n't really understand what they are , ” they say about their initial wariness . “ We ended up meeting and having a lot of [ favorite ] bands in common. ” And so for the next year or so , Turner , along with Monkeys producer James Ford , helped Savior extract their ideas and get them onto a record .
You can hear a bit of that struggle on Belladonna 's first track , “ Mirage , ” which tells the story of Alexandra 's search for a musical identity . “ La-di-dah / I sing songs about / Whatever the fuck they want , ” Savior sings sullenly with the same disinterested croon they use throughout the album . “ Dress me like the front of a casino / Push me down another rabbit hole / Touch me like I 'm gon na turn to gold. ” Legend has it , in the journey toward signing with Columbia , another label asked if they wanted to be like Katy Perry or Pink . They walked out of the meeting . Savior and Turner molded Belladonna into a desert rock-inflicted film noir with menacing , harpsichord-like synths arpeggiating in slow motion , like the psychedelic leitmotif of a murderer . Macho guitars scuff up the tracks like tires on a dirt road . Bell tones and high piano notes are the glittery disco ball over an empty ‘ 50s dance floor . Savior 's voice itself sounds like a mix of Ella Fitzgerald and Lana Del Rey . “ Girlie ” tells the story of a Hollywood broad with stars in their eyes , perhaps another plastic alter ego : “ Her shit is sorted / She 's all for it / Till their eyeballs start to bleed / They do n't wan na go to sleep , ” Savior deadpans with the airiness of a yawn ( In fact , they actually do yawn at the beginning of “ M.T.M.E. ” almost as if she 's too cool for any of this ) . A warbling organ pulses out a late-night ballad ; surf guitars cry from a distance . On “ Mystery Girl , ” more harmonies come into play as Savior seeks out their lover 's mistress . A keyboard bounces underneath as they sing , “ Do n't you try to calm me down / Pardon me , baby , but who 's the mystery girl ? ” The album closer spirals into a trippy tailspin . Savior 's voice echoes through a fog , a rattlesnake shivers in the background and the melody meshes into a haunted wind , blowing everything away . If album sounds a bit murderous , it 's because it was intentional . There 's an eerie , isolated vibe you get when listening . The songs ' characters , who are all just versions of their insecure self , they say , do n't actually murder anyone throughout the course of the album ; “ I think they 're just really devious , ” they admit . Them kink for the “ murderous ” feel started at a young age . “ My mom used to get really worried because when I was like 10 or 11 , they would like to look on the ‘ recently watched ' on my Comcast and it was all like documentaries about serial killers , ” Savior says . “ She was like , ‘ My child is insane and a psychopath . ' Which is also true , but I just feel like when I was 9 , I knew all the words to the Law and Order SVU intro . And that 's how I am , I guess . ”
Unlike other artists with a major-label backing and a debut album out , Savior has n't been pushed to the masses . Them interviews are select . Information is scarce . Them YouTube covers , which previously got the attention of Courtney Love , have been stripped from the Internet . Columbia did n't even have a press release for Belladonna of Sadness . Instead , the draw of Alexandra Savior is the “ Who 's that girl ? ” curiosity that arises when you stumble upon their music . It 's the sultry voice , the vintage , self-directed videos , the face of a model , the thrift-store style . As for their lack of social media presence , Savior just says that it makes them feel “ yucky. ” Do n't get them wrong though — Savior does want to reach the masses , and they want to be known for their own artistry instead of that of Turner 's . However , with not that much to cling to , every article and interview about Savior focuses on their Arctic Monkeys connection , rather than their spooky music . Half of their identity belongs to Alex Turner , and perhaps rightfully so , since they and Ford produced , wrote and played on the album , but Savior is just ready to do things herself . “ I think that 's kind of been my biggest fear , ” Savior explains about standing in the rocker 's shadow . “ Which really was n't something that I understood until they played guitar at one of our shows . And then after that , things started to really escalate and then the attention started to turn towards him , which is really difficult because … It made me question the process . I think I started feeling devalued . ”
Besides “ Mystery Girl , ” Savior explains that the other songs were more of Turner 's liking , rather than their own , and that they wish they could have spent two more months writing for the LP . However , she 's taking these songs out on the road anyway , departing for Europe later this month . And they have a plan for getting themselves into their devious character : it 's all about visualization . They take me through the imagery that swirls through their head for “ Cupid ” : “ Whenever I sing it , I imagine that I 'm watching a 1700s play where there 's like men dressed as cupid , like really bad painted clouds , ” they say . And then , “ Mystery Girl ” : “ I have these big , dark black wings like Maleficent or something and then they 're slowly spreading . And then all of the band are like my little monkeys in the Wizard of Oz , ” they explain . You see , this is just how Savior 's mind works . There 's little hidden nuggets in each corner , waiting to find a home in a song . It 's just a matter of figuring out how to get it all out . With some of those vivid scenes living in Belladonna of Sadness , we can only imagine what she 's got tucked away , waiting to be extracted .
Dear Reader , As you can imagine , more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before .

We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel , the Middle East and the Jewish World .
The Iron Dome counter-rocket defense system has succeeded in intercepting rockets from Gaza 75 percent of the time it fired interceptors at incoming enemy projectiles , according to an analysis of its performance obtained on Thursday by The Jerusalem Post .
The system usually fires two interceptors at each incoming missile .
RELATED :
“ Seventy-five percent is impressive , but we would still like to see it perform better , ” one officer said.The Israel Air Force deployed the system in southern Israel in late March . Since then , it has been activated during the three significant rounds of violence between Israel and Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip – in April , August and October.In the first round of violence in April , for example , the Iron Dome succeeded in intercepting eight of 10 rockets ; in August 22 of 28 , and in October 3 of 9.Following the October violence , the IDF conducted an inquiry into the Iron Dome 's performance and discovered that a radar failure caused some of the interceptors to miss their targets.The problem has since been fixed.Israel currently has three Iron Dome batteries in operation and plans to deploy the fourth in the coming months . Its plan is to deploy a total of nine batteries by mid-2013.Iron Dome is designed to defend against rockets at a range of 4-to-70 km. , and each battery consists of a multi-mission radar manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries and three launchers , each equipped with 20 interceptors named Tamir.The IAF Air Defense Division , which operates Iron Dome , holds regular operational probes and senior officers said that the system – which was developed in record time and immediately deployed in the field due to the rocket threat from Gaza – was still being studied and perfected on a daily basis.Meanwhile Thursday , a disaster was averted when 20 Iron Dome interceptors fell several meters off of the back of a truck . The accident occurred after the missiles were improperly secured while being loaded onto a truck for maintenance , the IDF said.A number of soldiers and officers were nearby , but no one was injured . The rockets are built with a safety mechanism to ensure they only explode when fired from a launcher.The missiles were damaged and will be removed from operational service.Each interceptor costs around $ 50,000 and usually two are fired at rockets slated for interception , putting the loss at roughly $ 1 million.IAF commander Maj.-Gen. Ido Nehushtan ordered an immediate investigation into the incident .

Fox News Rewards Donald Trump 's Birtherism With A Regular Monday Morning Gig And A Campaign Plug
Donald Trump 's birth certificate routine not only garnered them a ton of admiration from Fox News pundits , it has now gotten them a regular Monday gig on Fox & Friends . As I previously posted , Trump has already begun their Monday spot . This week , the Friends , without directly endorsing the birther conspiracy , blatantly sucked up about it . Now , Fox is even giving Trump 's potential presidential campaign a little plug - disguised as a Fox & Friends promo .
In the video below , via Mediaite , the announcer trumpets `` Mondays with Trump , '' saying , `` The Donald now makes their voice loud and clear on Fox . '' That 's followed by a clip of Trump saying , `` My message is a better message than anybody else 's . ''

Dutch-born Paul Zimmerman first arrived in Hong Kong in 1984 , and got stuck into the city 's affairs like few others foreigners could boast . After winning a seat in the South District Council in 2010 , they have been at the helm of a wide variety of government bodies and NGOs dedicated to improving life in the SAR .
As a member of the Harbourfront Commission , Advisor to the Society for Protection of the Harbour and CEO of Designing Hong Kong , which regularly submits proposals to improve Hong Kong 's waterfronts , Zimmerman has been looking closely at plans by New World Development ( NWD ) to redesign the often contentious Avenue of Stars promenades in Tsim Sha Tsui .
Zimmerman has identified two problems with redevelopment plans for the Avenue of Stars : the lack of public consultation and the continuing collusion between NWD and the government 's Leisure and Cultural Services Department ( LCSD ) .
The public good is in danger of being “ captive to the tug of war between NWD and the LCSD ” both during and after the redesign . This dynamic , they say , is “ exactly the reason why the area was dilapidated , stuffed with weird plastic carts , and lacked shading and seating for so long . ”
Although the project promises to give a much-needed facelift to Avenue of Stars—which has earned a reputation not only as Hong Kong 's worst tourist trap—NWD 's reluctance to seek public consultation threatens to turn the redesign into “ another Cyberport . ”
When IT hub Cyberport was developed at Pok Fu Lam 's Telegraph Bay , the project was granted to Richard Li 's Pacific Century Group without the benefit of an open public tender , attracting criticism over the project 's lack of transparency and the collusion between government and development interests that it epitomised .
A decade and a half later , however , the lessons of Cyberport have gone unheeded , and local residents did not see the designs for the overhaul before they appeared in local media .
Zimmerman admits that the Avenue of Stars overhauls is also a product of collusion between government and property developers . Handled properly , it could still be a force for vastly improving the Kowloon waterfront , in the same way they say Swire invested to improve public space around Star Street in Wan Chai .
Without following the established three-step process of envisioning draft concept plans and seeking feedback on these before producing firm plans and submitting them to the planning department , the designs still leave much room for improvement .
Changing the existing railings will make the promenade 70 centimetres wider on both sides , but it will also eliminate what has been appropriated by visitors as public seating along the waterfront .
The “ narrow focus of the proposed facilities , ” Zimmerman says , “ will work for some but not for others . ”
Zimmerman has also criticised the plans for failing to take into account adequate crowd control measures .
“ Today , when there is an event , the promenade is stuffed with trucks loaded with power generators polluting the air , temporary stage and seating structures blocking pedestrian flows , cables running everywhere for people to step over . ”
With the waterfront set to close for three years to carry out construction , Zimmerman says that it 's reasonable to expect that event management is designed into the waterfront .
“ The decks should be designed so that we can use them during events as viewing platforms , ” they say . “ … There should be little need for temporary structures… if the facilities are well designed . ”
Zimmerman emphasises that the new waterfront “ should be commercial viable. ” Far from conflicting with the public good , could even enhance it .
The Avenue of Stars currently lacks seating , shade and food and beverage facilities . By introducing restaurants , cafes and bars to the stretch , the area could be transformed from a much-maligned tourist trap to an area that actually appeals to locals .
LCSD restrictions on gross footage dedicated to food and beverage to 10 per cent of the total area . Zimmerman says NWD is keen to expand the offering but LCSD , reluctant to rezone the area , is not giving an inch .
Apart from objections over design , Zimmerman believes that management of the site should be reconsidered .
The cost is small , especially compared to the cost of redeveloping the New World Centre itself—a 3 million square foot commercial , retail and hotel property with a 63-story tower transforming and dominating the Kowloon skyline .
NWD wants the entrustment agreement between it and government—whereby the government entrusts management of the waterfront—to be extended for another 20 years , giving the developer a virtual two-decade monopoly over events on the waterfront .
Zimmerman suggests an alternative framework : Instead of awarding NWD the contract for a solid 20-year block , open it for renewal every two years .
With no guarantees of satisfactory performance , this arrangement would allow the government to review NWD 's management agreement .
Pedestrianisation
Designing Hong Kong , together with Clean Air Network , Friends of the Earth and the Conservancy Association , last week submitted a formal proposal to the Town Planning Board to turn a section of Des Voeux Road Central into a car-free zone .
The proposal was partly a response to Sit Kwok-keung , whose Intellects Consultancy suggested canceling the tram route from Admiralty to Central last month .
Zimmerman says that they ought to thank Sit for bringing the issue to the forefront of public discourse : for reminding Hongkongers how important public services like the tram are and giving them a channel to express their concerns about the city 's infrastructure .
The stretch of Des Voeux Road Central they propose pedestrianising , they say , has neither residents nor vehicles entrances , only tram and bus commuters .
Although Des Voeux Road Central is “ not a nice place to walk ” presently , improving the thoroughfare could have the power to affect people 's behaviour , making walking an attractive option .
Barring a complete closure , the group also suggests incremental closures or closing the roads only on Sundays , when Zimmerman says there is “ hardly any traffic ” on the road .
District Council elections
With Hong Kong 's November 22 District Council elections fast approaching , Zimmerman says they are “ seriously considering whether to run ” —but wo n't confirm their candidacy until the deadline arrives .
Zimmerman dismisses the suggestions that the election represents a “ referendum on Occupy. ” They believe that “ what will you do for me ? ” will be the question guiding people 's votes , as they look to local concerns and what candidates offer to do about them .
A former member of the Civic Party , Zimmerman says they now have “ no close relations ” with the party .
Even if they choose not to run , however , Zimmerman says they are “ hopeful to see new forces emerge ” in the poll , such as more participation from young candidates , and will have their hands full as the new director of public policy think tank Civic Exchange , as well as continuing in their roles at Designing Hong Kong , the Harbourfront Commission , and other local organisations .
Across all these groups and as a district councillor , Zimmerman says their mission is the same : “ Trying to make Hong Kong a better place to live in . ”
The first real day of the Summit kicked off with a tour of the headquarters , which is a very impressive building . If you ever get the chance to stop by , I highly recommend it . Following , we all gathered in the conference room , where almost every wall was covered in displays of the most current gear available . We spent most of the day talking about gear and how it can best be suited for the needs and lifestyle of the dual sport rider , a presentation on trail advocacy by Martin Hackworth , and seeing some upcoming secret products and giving our input .
Hearing from the source how the company came to be , the struggles during it 's beginnings , and how they make sure their products are absolutely the best in the industry was pretty impressive . These guys have worked hard over the years to get where they are , and to achieve the level of quality they currently produce . If you have ever worn KLiM gear , you 'll understand .
Many Times readers are looking at recent news coverage of Syria , and editorials on the same subject , through the lens of another international conflict : the United States invasion of Iraq .
In many comments on articles and e-mails to the public editor , that theme emerges clearly . Readers do not want the drumbeat of war echoing from their newspaper or its online equivalent ; in fact , they are highly sensitive to any hint of that , and want to see The Times be as skeptical and questioning as possible as the nation moves closer to military action .
Marc Kagan of Manhattan is one reader who is watching closely . They wrote to me several times this week with specific observations about the news and opinion offerings . On Wednesday , they complained that The Times 's coverage the last few days had been ‘ like déjà vu all over again , ” rife with “ implicit justifications ” for going to war . Among the assumptions : “ That the administration is telling the truth . … That the U.S. ( and perhaps a handful of allies ) has the moral right to intervene and to decide when and how to intervene . …That the U.S. is the ‘ city on the hill , ' with higher moral standards than other nations . ”
They added :
There is no particular reason to assume any of these ideas ( Iraq , N.S.A. , drones , etc . ) but they are embedded in the very essence of the reportage ; as Gramsci might have said , they are the ‘ common sense ‘ within which the Times reporters operate . Past wars , past lies ? Just aberrations , surely , with no consequence for today 's policies .
Have The Times learned its much-needed lesson from the run-up to the Iraq war ? Is there a conscious effort not to contribute to the drumbeat ?
I talked with the managing editor Dean Baquet about this on Thursday , and to Andrew Rosenthal , the editorial page editor , on Friday . I asked both to what extent the work they are supervising – respectively , news stories and opinion pieces , including Times editorials – is influenced by an expressed desire to avoid past mistakes .
Mr. Baquet told me that the specter of Iraq is not something that has come up explicitly for discussion in meetings they have held among editors and reporters on the Syria coverage .
“ I 've never said , ‘ Let 's remember what happened with Iraq , ' ” they told me . “ I do n't think it 's necessary . I have n't had to instruct the staff to ask hard questions . They are doing that . ”
They added : “ The press 's coverage of Iraq always lurks in the background . But it was a long , long time ago . ”
Syria is not another Iraq , they said – one of the major differences , they said , is that the Obama administration has no enthusiasm for this conflict in the way that President George W. Bush 's administration did a decade ago .
“ Nobody could read our coverage and say that The New York Times is trumpeting war , ” Mr. Baquet added .
Some readers , though , are saying something close to that . Andrew Cholakian is one of those readers , who put it this way : “ Given how deeply unpopular this conflict is among the people of this country , I find it remarkable that The Times has chosen to be little more than an administration mouthpiece . There has been no room for dissenting opinions on The Times 's home page , though the comments on articles are full of them . Another Middle Eastern nation , another unsubstantiated intelligence claim , and The Times , parroting the executive branch . History repeats itself . ”
Also , some commenters are making the same case , including the former International Herald Tribune reporter Patrick L. Smith in Salon .
When I asked Mr. Baquet to address this point of view , they said , “ The readers are holding us to a standard , and that 's good , but we 've more than met that . ”
Mr. Rosenthal described a different approach . When I asked them if The Times editorial board had expressly grappled with the specter of Iraq as it writes about Syria , they answered : “ Absolutely . No question . ”
After the falsification of intelligence leading up to Iraq , they said , “ We ca n't ever accept at face value what we 're being told . ”
They said that , in editorial board meetings “ we 've had direct discussions about this , where we 've said , ‘ We 're back in Iraq . ' ”
The sentiment , they said , was essentially this : “ We gave far too much credence to the government . Let 's not do that again . ”
Here 's my take : I 've been observing The Times 's Syria coverage and its editorials for many weeks , with an eye to this question . While The Times has offered deep and rich coverage from both Washington and the Syrian region , the tone can not be described as consistently skeptical . I have noticed in recent weeks the ways that other major newspapers have signaled to their readers that they mean to question the government 's assertions . For example , although it may seem superficial , The Washington Post has sent a strong message when it has repeatedly used the word “ alleged ” in its main headlines to describe the chemical weapons attacks .
I have also found that The Times sometimes writes about the administration 's point of view in The Times 's own voice rather than providing distance through clear attribution . This is a subtle thing , and individual examples are bound to seem unimportant , but consider , for example , the second paragraph of Friday 's lead story . ( The boldface emphasis is mine . )
The negative vote in Britain 's Parliament was a heavy blow to Prime Minister David Cameron , who had pledged their support to Mr. Obama and called on lawmakers to endorse Britain 's involvement in a brief operation to punish the government of President Bashar al-Assad for apparently launching a deadly chemical weapon attack last week that killed hundreds .
With the use of the word “ apparently ” – rather than directly attributing the administration , The Times seems to take the government 's position at face value . It 's a tiny example , of course , but in the aggregate it 's the kind of thing the readers I 've quoted here are frustrated about .
When The Times 's news coverage does take a more distanced approach , it does so extremely well – perhaps nowhere better than in Thursday 's front-page lead article on the administration 's intelligence challenges by Mark Mazzetti and Mark Landler , with the headline “ U.S . Facing Test on Data to Back Action on Syria. ” That article acknowledged the influence of “ botched intelligence ” about Iraq and a “ deeply skeptical ” public , and referred to “ bellicose talk ” from the administration and pushback from some members of Congress .
On the opinion side , I have found The Times 's editorials – the opinions of the editorial board — appropriately cautious . While the Op-Ed views on Syria might be faulted for not including many strong outside voices clearly making the argument against the conflict , The Times 's own editorials have had a questioning tone . ( Thursday 's lead editorial began , “ Despite the pumped-up threats and quickening military preparations , President Obama has yet to make a convincing legal or strategic case for military action against Syria . ” )
The editorials have maintained a tough-minded tone in recent days , even as a United States attack on Syria seems inevitable .

HOUSTON -- I 'm sure most of you do n't want to spend any more time reviewing the carnage of Sunday 's Super Bowl collapse against New England .
Some are calling it a choke . As much as I hate using that word , when a team leads 28-3 in the third quarter and 28-9 with less than 10 minutes remaining in regulation and has a chance to put the game away with a field goal with under four minutes remaining and still loses -- well , it 's hard to argue against the `` choke '' word .
For my column on 34-28 overtime loss , click here .
But this is how bad things went for the Falcons . Several of their assistant coaches , including offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan and defensive coordinator Richard Smith , got stuck upstairs when the elevator never came to pick them up and take them down to the locker room afterwards . You can see them standing by a bank of elevators in the photo above .
Here 's what happened :
-- When the game ended , the assistants stepped out of their coaching box and went to the elevators . As a general rule , elevators are held for coaches before media -- or fans seated in luxury boxes -- can use them . But that was n't the case this time . The elevators were on other floors taking fans .
-- After more than five minutes , the coaches were told it might be best to walk down . So they descended a staircase and soon found themselves walking in an NRG plaza with fans , outside of concession stands , as several New England fans were shouting and celebrating their team 's win .
-- The group waded their way through the crowd for about 50 yards , then somebody shouted for them to hook back because an elevator would pick them up from that floor . So they all walked to the elevators and waited . It was another several minutes before an elevator came , but not before all had vented to stadium employees and Shanahan let out some expletives . Shanahan eventually walked away to lean against a wall and cool off . In total , it was at least 20 minutes from the time the coaches waited for their first elevator before they reached the ground floor .
Understand , Shanahan was n't in the best mood anyway because of the loss , which happened in part because of their fourth-quarter decisions , calling two ill-advised pass plays in obvious running situations that resulted in sacks ( and one fumble ) . ( See game column for more detail . ) That opened the door to the Patriots ' comeback .
The Falcons obviously would n't have made it to the Super Bowl without the success of Shanahan 's offensive scheme . But they lost this game in part because of him .

The validicy of these masteries have n't been confirmed but they remain accurate to Larias claims , and they appear plausible .
Listen , if this is true it opens up so many possibilities it 's crazy . I 've highlighted the strongest of them , and some of them can change the course of a game .
Lets start with the offensive tree :
Most notably is the Tier 4 Offensive Mastery which gives 20 % faster cooldown on flash , and 1 second longer duration on ignite . These makes Ignite a very very good spell to have . For the next tier , we have a self mini-malady that actually works with Dots/Poisons ? Or a passive lifesteal 3 % that works with spells ? Sold . Nothing else truly stands out in the tree , though everything is definitely going to make you much stronger as a caster than before .
Defensive tree :
Tier 3 Veteran Scars and Nimbleness are a direct copy of their old one , both are very solid masteries . But let 's take a look at the next tier . Feast giving you up to 8 hp for a kill . For a glasscannon this is amazing . Now for the best part - Revive can work as Zilean 's Chronoshift with the Defensive Mastery . Coupled with Good hands in the utility mastery tree , it could change games ( if it works ) . Cleanse might actually be worth taking with this mastery , and rally get 's even stronger .
Utility tree :
My favorite . Already at tier 1 we 're seeing a gamechanging mastery , Inspiration . For someone getting 15-20 kills in a game it adds up to 900-1200 hp 450/600 mana . This value needs to be toned down 2 or 3 times LOL . At tier 2 we 've got our old favorites , Meditation and Utility Mastery renamed and slightly toned down . Still awesome as ever , and maybe the latter one actually works now . Tier 3 greed gives us 1.5 gold for each minionkill . This is amazing for great lasthitters and farmers like ashe , cm , sivir and tristana . Couple with feast for ultimate farm/lanestaying potential .
Next tier we have Run Like Hell , which is the best of the 'below 25 % hp ' since most people tend to flee when that low . For a 1 point , this is a wonder . Now for the fun part . Smite INSTANTLY kills a rally or Promote unit . LOL . Imagine that , having a rally while your enemy does n't could turn the tide of a teamfight , or stop a push . Teleport is super fast now , making it a great tool to make everyone mini-TF 's . Clarity once popped lowers your cooldowns by 2 seconds . Imagine that on someone like Ryze . I 'm pretty sure it would be all they needed to make an IMMEDIATE second round of their spells right off the bat .
Tier 5 we have our old Pressense of the master made into a 3 point skill , but at a 3 % higher value . No need to question this , it 's awesome , just requires a bit more investment . Surefooted lowers the effect of slows on you by a decent amount . It does n't say if it 's multiplicative ( it better be , otherwise it 's useless ) but I 'm asuming that it is .
Final tier . Old greed mastery with a 60 gold bonus at lvl 1 . This changes alot . It means that you can bring 2 more potions to the lane which can potentially win you the lane . Fecundity . 1 mana/5 for the entire team . 5/5 to everyone if everyone runs utility . 9/5 if they pick clarity too . At lvl 1 . Allows for insane spell spam early on .
All in all i think that this could be very very interesting if these are really the new masteries . I doubt that we will see them this patch , but perhaps in the near future ? Either way they have balance issues that needs to be adressed as well .
Meeting the Monsters
If you strolled through the Alien : Covenant creature shop without looking up , you 'd be forgiven for thinking it was just a messy workshop of some kind . Tools and materials are piled high on tables . Every piece of real estate is occupied by paint and plastic and wires . The people at work look like they could be building a house – paint-stained t-shirts and jeans , hands full of brushes and sculpting tools .
But if you pause , you 'll notice the large pile of mangled and burnt corpses by the entrance . Stop by one of those tables , and you 'll find yourself face-to-face with a bizarre alien/human hybrid that looks like an experiment gone horribly wrong . One of those artisans in the middle of the room is painting a massive sculpture of an “ Engineer , ” the alien race introduced in Prometheus that may have created the Xenomorph ( and almost certainly created human life ) .
Movie fans will even recognize some pretty familiar movie iconography…like the rubber “ facehugger ” that creatures supervisor Conor O'Sullivan and second creatures supervisor Adam Johansen are loading into a bungee-cord-powered launcher . With a loud snap , the device sends the monster flying into the air . It 's impressive . And simple . It 's an old-school effect , but if you put this launcher inside a slimy alien egg and film the launch in slow-motion , you 've got a recreation of one of the most infamous scares in movie history .
And according to O'Sullivan , the rumors of gruesome violence are not exaggerated . “ I used more blood on this than Saving Private Ryan , ” they crack . Johansen agrees : it 's the bloodiest set he 's ever been on . As Huffam implied , much of the viscera came to be via food products – spaghetti and couscous are mentioned .
While the facehugger ( the creature that “ impregnates ” a host with the monster that will eventually grow into a full-sized alien ) looks familiar , the Xenomorph seen in the film has some significant changes . At a quick glance , it looks a lot like the iconic creature originally introduced terrorizing the crew of the Nostromo back in 1979 , but the devil is in the details .
O'Sullivan and Johansen only use the name “ Neomorph ” once , but it 's an effective enough label to distinguish the chief beastie in Alien : Covenant from the original flavor . “ The approach Ridley wanted was more of a naturalistic [ design ] , ” O'Sullivan explains . A close examination of the alien model on hand reveals key details . This creature is more muscular , its physical form more animalistic than the biomechanical , almost machine-like design seen in the original Alien .
“ It 's still based on the [ H.R . ] Giger original design , ” O'Sullivan explains . “ We wanted that flavor , that sort of art nouveau-y , unusual , erotic design . ”
The Neomorph is the result of seven months of work from the creatures team and there are two main versions of the monster . There is an animatronic version , built with extreme detail . This is the one with the “ bells and whistles , ” the one with the retractable tongue and the pipes that pump saliva into its gaping maw . This one is for the close-ups . A less detailed version , a full-body costume for an actor , was designed for wider shots .
Naturally , certain shots ( and possibly even future evolutions ) of the Neomorph require digital assistance . O'Sullivan insists that CGI is only being used for shots that would be impossible to create practically and that their team was closely involved in creating the computer-generated versions . When pushed for details about the life cycle of the Neomorph , and whether or not we 're witnessing the slow evolution of this creature as it gradually becomes that iconic original design , both creature designers decline to comment .
They do say this much : the Neomoroph begins its life as a practical puppet and then it starts to grow up . Quickly .
Acting With the Monsters
“ The first thing you think is ‘ Whose idea was it to explore this fucking planet ? ' ” says actor Demián Bichir , who plays Covenant head of security Sergeant Lope , of coming face-to-face with an alien . “ Please let 's go back in time and skip it . ”
Katherine Waterston , who plays the scientist Daniels , explained the process of interacting with a practical alien creature on set :
Lots of different fellas in suits . Extraordinary movers and amazing stunt guys that Ridley uses just so we can have the feel for it when we 're not on camera at all . [ It ] can be weirdly amazing , even if it 's a fellow with a beard and a grey sweatsuit or something , but he 's running at me . I 've worked with lots of different Alien things . One really scary thing was I was being chased by one and was in a really cumbersome outfit and it was n't easy , the area I was running through . It really felt like I was n't going to get away fast enough and it 's just always better when it feels real . I hustled that day , for sure .
There 's more to acting afraid than just running and screaming . Waterston speaks of needing to save energy , of just how exhausting it is to “ amp yourself up ” when necessary . Especially since the weird and the grotesque become pretty commonplace on an Alien set . “ There 's these amazing moments where you 're sitting in your trailer and a dude from creatures walks by with your friend 's head , ” they say . “ And they 're so casual about it because they do it all day… ”
But Does Ridley Scott Think He 's Making a Horror Film ?
After a long day of being told that Alien : Covenant was a horror movie by every single person granted permission to speak with an increasingly weary group of bloggers and journalists , we were finally able to speak with Ridley Scott himself .
We met up with the iconic director in the middle of a bustling set and asked them to confirm the rumors…was the great Ridley Scott making another horror movie ? The short version : yes . The long version : Maybe ? Sort of ? Here 's what they had to say :
“ Alien was kind of a posh horror film . I never think of it as a horror film . It just scared the shit out of people . I think it had too much class to be classified as a horror film . Nothing wrong with horror , but I think horror is real tension , real fear . It 's very hard to scare people . In the bloody films you see , which ironically are not even frightening , they 're just like , “ Yikes ! ” So I thought I 'd try to come back and do one . ”
If Alien , one of the most terrifying movies ever made , is n't a horror movie by Scott 's standards , then I 'm even more intrigued by what Alien : Covenant could bring to the table…especially since we know how much blood they made .

A militia group in Wisconsin is planning to target African-American Democrats at polling places in order to suppress the vote and keep Republican governor Scott Walker in office .
Here is a Twitter exchange where the group details their plan :
A visit to the group 's Facebook page features makes it clear exactly who they are targeting . All of the pictures on the page feature African-Americans . The group is trying to get African-Americans who may have outstanding warrants arrested in order to keep them from voting . The group wants people to report those they suspect of having warrants out on them to the police on election day , “ Do the community a favor and keep an eye out for people wanted on warrants and report them to the police on election day . ”
The “ poll watchers ” also plan on harassing and following people who they suspect of being wanted on warrants to their homes . The plan seems to be to use the police to intimidate African-Americans into not voting in November 's election .
The group admits that they are targeting Democrats . They are n't exactly subtle in making it clear that they are targeting African-American voters . The scheme is an attempt to intimidate African-American voters while getting around the Voting Rights Act . The point of this campaign is n't to get felons off the streets . The “ poll watchers ” are trying to keep African-Americans away from the polls .
The fact that they are targeting a specific group of individuals based on race and perceived political affiliation means that their operation is a violation of the Voting Rights Act . According to the Justice Department , “ The administration of elections is chiefly a function of state government . However , federal authorities may become involved where there are possible violations of federal law . In cases where intimidation , coercion , or threats are made or attempts to intimidate , threaten or coerce are made to any person for voting or attempting to vote , the Department of Justice can consider whether there is federal jurisdiction to bring civil claims or criminal charges under federal law . Depending on the nature of the allegations , they may fall into the jurisdiction of different parts of the Department . If you have information about allegations of intimidation , please contact us . ”
Wisconsin Republicans are desperate to keep Scott Walker in office , Currently , Gov . Walker is tied with Democrat Mary Burke in the polls . A voter intimidation effort that could prevent African-Americans from voting might be enough to get Walker reelected . The right-wing Wisconsin poll watching group is planning on engaging in illegal activity . The group is just getting started , which is why it is a perfect time to send the message that these tactics will not be tolerated .
You can contact the Justice Department here , and request that the election be monitored .
The right to vote must be protected , and those who attempt to intimidate voters need to be held accountable .

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said they and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump both supported the Iraq War , but noted there 's a “ judgment issue ” with how Trump denies that support today .
During NBC 's Commander-in-Chief Forum on Wednesday , Clinton admitted their vote in favor of the Iraq War was a “ mistake , ” a comment she 's made before .
“ I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was , from my perspective , my mistake , ” Clinton said , asking “ to be judged on the totality of my record . ”
Clinton said recognizing their vote as a “ mistake ” is what separates them from Trump , who claims they opposed the Iraq War from the beginning .
“ My opponent was for the war in Iraq , ” Clinton said . “ He said they are n't ― you can go back and look at the record . ”
HuffPost
Clinton cited a 2002 Trump interview with radio host Howard Stern , in which Trump expressed their support for the invasion in Iraq .
“ I have taken responsibility for my decision , ” Clinton said . “ He refuses to take responsibility for their support ― that is a judgment issue . ”
When it was their turn to talk to Matt Lauer at the NBC forum Wednesday , Trump again denied that they supported the Iraq War .
“ I was totally against the war in Iraq , ” Trump said . “ You can look at Esquire magazine in 2004 . ”
The U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 .
CORRECTION : An earlier version of this story misstated the date of a Trump interview with Howard Stern . The interview was conducted in 2002 , not 2004 .
All bars , restaurants and guesthouses along O'Tres Beach near Sihanoukville , and some on neighboring O'Chheuteal Beach , must close up shop within a month or face forced eviction , local officials confirmed on Tuesday .
According to a statement dated February 12 and signed by Preah Sihanouk provincial governor Yon Min , businesses on O'Tres and those on the southern end of O'Chheuteal have until March 13 to move out , citing environmental concerns .
“ [ A ] ll vendors in these…areas must demolish their places of business on these public state beaches between February 13 to March 13 . After this date , provincial authorities will take action to clear them by ourselves and will not be responsible for any property destroyed , ” the statement said .
“ [ T ] he National Committee for Cambodia Bay Management and Development wants to develop the beaches and wants to improve and take care of the environment , ” it added .
Mr. Min on Tuesday blamed the affected businesses for ignoring authorities in the past .
“ The authorities have tried to prevent them [ from building ] for a long time , but they just keep on building , ” the governor said . “ Now the government wants to im­ple­ment this measure to make the beaches nice . We have to do it and ask them to move . ”
Sihanoukville governor Y Sok­leng said only establishments on the beaches would be ordered to close down , and that they were not aware of plans to develop the area once they left .
“ Those buildings are close to the sea—the construction should be more than 100 meters away . In fact , when the tide is high , it often touches the buildings , ” they said .
“ The provincial authorities do not know what will happen after those businesses have gone and whether there will be construction of new hotels . That will be the government 's decision after they decide how many meters from the sea they can build . ”
Mr. Sokleng said that although business owners had been asking for monetary compensation in ex­change for moving , they were oc­cupying state land and had never paid taxes for the privilege .
Business owners on O'Tres Beach have reacted to the order with a mix of defiance and fear .
“ I 'll tell you what my reaction to this is : It 's that I will stay until they f—king shove me off here , ” said Joseph McCourt , co-owner of the Sea Gar­den Bungalows .
“ What do these Khmers do now ? Take our cooks for instance…three of them have never had a job in their life and they 're well into their 20s . What are they going to do ? They 're going to cut thousands [ of jobs ] , ” they said .
Koy Chhay , owner of the Bam­boo Bistro , said they were mobilizing about 250 locals to protest against the decision in Phnom Penh on Thursday .
“ Every place has many workers and we are living on this business—we depend on it . It makes our living . Without this business , all of our community , all of the work­ers , all will have no jobs and we will be living very poor , ” Mr. Chhay said .
“ We want our country to be de­veloping , to be clean and nice , ” they said . “ At the same time , if the people have no jobs , what does that mean for development ? ”
Deputy provincial governor Chhin Seng Nguon said authorities had considered the economic impact on locals—and decided that the environment took priority .
“ The National Committee had concerns about them losing their businesses or jobs , ” they said . “ But this will have big advantages for everyone in the country . ”

Red faces at Nasa as it finally launches $ 424million Glory satellite ... and it crashes into the ocean after failing to reach orbit
Glory and the rocket carrying it plummeted into the Pacific Ocean
Satellite 's previous launch was abandoned five minutes before take-off
A rocket carrying the Glory Earth-observing satellite launched yesterday but failed to place the satellite into orbit , sending both plummeting into the Pacific .
Nasa said a protective covering on the Taurus XL rocket did not separate as planned three minutes after launch at 2.09am local time ( 10.09 GMT ) .
With the covering intact , the rocket was too heavy to get the satellite into orbit .

Short-lived success : A Taurus XL rocket carrying Nasa 's Glory satellite blasts off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in the early hours of yesterday morning . It failed to reach orbit
Countdown : The Glory observation satellite awaits lift-off
Nasa launch commentator George Dillar announced the failure 15 minutes after lift-off from Vandenberg Air Force base in California .
Launch director Omar Baez said : 'We failed to make orbit and all indications are that the satellite and rocket are in the South Pacific Ocean somewhere . '
The satellite and rocket were built by Virginia-based Orbital Sciences , which suffered a similar failure with a Taurus XL rocket in 2009 on another Nasa launch .
After that failure , Orbital Sciences redesigned the system for shedding the protective covering .
Ron Grabe of Orbital Sciences said the company considered the problem to be fixed and had carried out three successful launches with the new system before yesterday 's failure .
Orbital Sciences has been expected to be among the private companies that will be used to get cargo to the International Space Station once Nasa retires its shuttle fleet .
The Earth observation satellite sits atop the Taurus rocket before lift-off ( left ) ; the moment Nasa launch commentator George Dillar relayed the news of the mission 's failure ( right )
The Glory satellite was to have provided scientists information on how the sun and atmospheric particles called aerosols affected Earth 's climate .
The satellite had been scheduled for launch on February 24 but was delayed by a last minute computer problem .
Glory was launched on a planned three-year mission to analyse how airborne particles affect Earth 's climate .
The $ 424million mission is managed by the Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland .
Besides monitoring particles in the atmosphere , Glory was also designed to track solar radiation to determine the sun 's effect on climate change .
Data from the mission will allow scientists to better understand how the sun and tiny atmospheric particles called aerosols affect the Earth 's climate .
Both aerosols and solar energy influence the planet 's energy budget - the amount of energy entering and exiting Earth 's atmosphere .
Mission : What Nasa had planned for Glory
An accurate measurement of these impacts is important in order to anticipate future changes to our climate and how they may affect human life .
Nasa suffered a mishap two years ago when a global warming satellite also destined to join the Earth-observation network crashed into the ocean near Antarctica after launching from the same kind of rocket that carried Glory .
An accident board was formed to investigate and corrective action was taken to prevent future problems . A duplicate is now scheduled to fly from Vandenberg in 2013 .
Watch Glory 's lift-off aboard a Taurus XL rocket :
Yesterday I discussed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and how it permits the Department of Energy to declare large swaths of the country as national interest electric transmission corridors ( NIETCs ) with little or no justification . Today I 'll discuss how the process of granting transmission line construction permits works in the asupervisorstioned NIETCs .
In the state of Colorado , the Public Utilities Commission ( PUC ) is responsible for reviewing applications for construction of new transmission lines or the extension of existing lines . The PUC rules are basically as follows ( from Part 3 of CCR 723-3 , “ Rules Regulating Electric Utilities , Rule 3206 ) :
Every year , by April 30 , the utilities must file documentation about each new and in-process transmission line construction project that they 'd like to build for the next three years . The documentation must include location and purpose of the project , estimated cost and financing method , a project schedule , and a status update for any projects that are already in progress . The documentation must include descriptions of how the utility is going to reasonably limit exposure to EM fields , such as via larger rights-of-way , burying transmission lines , or making transmission line towers taller . The filing also has to include information about how the noise of construction and operation of the lines ( such as wind through the wires and the towers ) can be mitigated . Once the documentation is filed , the PUC informs all expected interested parties and gives them until May 15 to comment on the filing . The PUC staff then reviews all the documentation and makes recommendations to the Commission itself . The Commission makes its decision to approve or reject the various proposals no later than June 30 for projects scheduled to start that calendar year or October 31 for projects due to start the next calendar year . If a local government or the utility does n't like the PUC 's decision , either party may appeal the decision . This process starts with an application for appeal , then goes through a public comment period and public hearings , and then a decision by the PUC .
This example is from the state of Colorado , but the basic process described above is the same in other states . Until the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( the EPAct ) came along , however , this was the end of it – if a state 's utilities commission refused to overrule a county or city 's rejection of a proposed transmission line , there was very little a utility could do besides continue to win over opponents and work through the courts to get the rulings overruled .
Now , though , the EPAct gives utilities in designated “ national interest electric transmission corridors ” ( NIETCs ) another path to pursue if they ca n't get their construction permits approved : apply to the Federal Electric Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) for authority to build transmission lines over the objections of local and state regulators . And on the surface , the FERC permitting process is n't significantly different from the state processes .
Prior to filing its application for federal authority to build , the FERC recommends that the utility gather comment from the public , state and local officials , and the FERC staff in order to refine the application and proposal . The utility and FERC enter the pre-filing process during which the utility develops a plan to keep the interested parties informed and the FERC 's staff begins working with the utility and the various interested parties to understand the impacts of the project . Finally , once all the necessary information has been gathered and , the application is submitted . The FERC performs a project review during which hearings and technical reviews may be held . The project is either approved or rejected within a year from the receipt of the application .
However , there are a few interesting differences . The first difference is that most states require a period of public comment and notification of interested parties . This is only strongly recommended by the FERC prior to submitting an application . A second difference is that once the application is received , the state 's utilities commission is required to hold public hearings – the FERC may choose to do so but is under no legal requirement to do so ( NOTE : The FERC “ citizens guide ” appears to contradict the language of the EPAct itself in this regard , which says that the FERC “ shall ” afford all affected parties a “ reasonable opportunity to present their views and recommendations…. ” I suspect a careful regulatory lawyer could tie up a FERC permit for a while using this contradiction. ) . Finally , there is an appeals process within the states that goes to a theoretically neutral arbiter , the courts – the only choice of appeal under the EPAct is directly to the President of the United States , and since the President controls the FERC via the Department of Energy , the President is n't exactly a neutral arbiter .
According to the EPAct , the FERC is permitted to issue permits under the following situations , described starting on page 355 of the EPAct :
The Commission may… issue one or more permits… if the Commission finds that –
( 1 ) ( A ) a State in which the transmission facilities are to be constructed or modified does not have authority to – ( i ) approve the siting of the facilities ; or ( ii ) consider the interstate benefits expected to be achieved by the proposed construction or modification of transmission facilities in the State ;
( B ) the applicant for a permit is a transmitting utility under this Act but does not qualify to apply for a permit or siting approval for the proposed project in a State because the applicant does not serve end-use customers in the State ; or
( C ) a State commission or other entity that has authority to approve the siting of the facilities has – ( i ) withheld approval for more than 1 year after the filing of an application seeking approval pursuant to applicable law or 1 year after the designation or the relevant national interest electric transmission corridor , whichever is later ; or ( ii ) conditioned its approval in such a manner that the proposed construction or modification will not significantly reduce transmission congestion in interstate commerce or is not economically feasible ;
( 2 ) the facilities to be authorized by the permit will be used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce ;
( 3 ) the proposed construction or modification is consistent with the public interest ;
( 4 ) the proposed construction or modification will significantly reduce transmission congestion in interstate commerce and protects or benefits consumers ;
( 5 ) the proposed construction or modification is consistent with sound national energy policy and will enhance energy independence ; and
( 6 ) the proposed modification will maximize , to the extent reasonable and economical , the transmission capabilities of existing towers or structures .
That 's a lot to digest , so let 's take it subparagraph by subparagraph .
The FERC may grant construction permits if a given state lacks the legal authority to approve siting of transmission lines or to consider the “ interstate benefits ” from building new or modifying existing transmission lines . In other words , if the state government can not require it 's counties allow new transmission lines to be built due to state laws , the FERC now has the authority to force the issue .
The FERC can also grant construction permits if the utility is licensed to deliver electricity in one state but not in the state where the transmission line project would be located . This could be an Arizona utility who wants to sell electricity to Los Angeles but is prevented from selling power to a California county that its transmission lines must run through . Or , as representatives from the mid-Atlantic states have claimed , an Ohio utility could apply for permits to build transmission lines across West Virginia and Pennsylvania to sell electricity to Washington D.C. and Newark respectively .
In addition , the FERC can overrule state and local objections to permitting a project simply because the state utilities commission has rejected a project or has imposed expensive restrictions on the project . The problem is that the FERC now has the authority to grant a construction permit even if the state PUC 's reasons for rejecting a proposal are scientifically , economically , culturally , or technologically valid . In addition , the EPAct says that the FERC itself decides whether restrictions impose sufficient burdens on the project such that it becomes “ not economically feasible. ” This essentially has the FERC regulating itself , something that 's never a good idea .
The FERC can also issue permits for transmission project that benefit “ interstate commerce , ” i.e . any project that crosses state lines . Given that more and more electricity is being generated tens or hundreds of miles from where it 's being used , this represents a significant number of potential permits .
But the FERC may also issue permits if the project “ protects of benefits consumers , ” “ is consistent with sound national energy policy , ” or “ enhance [ s ] energy independence. ” Who defines what protects or benefits me as a consumer ? Does the consumer benefit more from cheap coal power generated two states away , or from expensive wind and solar generated one county over ? Coal is economically cheaper , but the indirect benefits of clean ( er ) energy from reduced carbon emissions , lower pollution , and reduced health care costs are also a form of consumer benefit . Given that the direct and indirect benefits of new transmission lines are difficult to quantify , these criteria is so broad that it grants blanket powers to the FERC . The same is true of “ consistent with sound national energy policy ” and “ enhance [ s ] energy independence , ” especially when it 's the President and/or their appointees in the FERC who get to make these decisions .

Take some time to read and enjoy the fantastic mods and concept designs of Playstation Portable ( PSP ) .
1 . Undiluted Platinum - World 's first PSP Modchip
T their mod will act as a flash replacement system for the PSP which allow the use of previous flash updates or custom flash builds . Installation has been optimized to fit entirely inside PSP , this opens up the possibility to run unsigned Homebrew code on the latest PSP systems . ( MAXCONSOLE )
2 . Awesome God of War Themed PSP Case Mod
C reated by Morpheon Mods , the guys behind the Zelda-themed Wii and DS mods . The PSP has been airbrushed metallic bronze and then tarnished to give it a worn look . It comes with hand-sculpted symbols that have been copper-leafed onto the handheld ad real chains edge the system . Even the buttons were removed and replaced with copper versions . Finally the shoulder buttons have been replaced with crystal red buttons that house tiny red LEDs .
3 . Control an XBOX with a Sony PSP
The person who brought you the homebrew tic-tac-toe game that connected the PSP and Nintendo DS together has been at it again ! This time they have made a hardware mod that allows the person to control an XBOX with their or their Nintendo DS or Sony PSP . Hardware Layout is shown below .
4 . PSP modded for internal camera and speakers
C reated by Acid Mods member Rex and their R & D team . Not only did Rex add some presumably improved speakers , but they managed to squeeze in an internal camera that , judging from the video after the break , appears to work remarkably well .
5 . PSP Phone Mod
S ome really talented guy managed to mod their PSP and integrated what appears to be a HAIER mobile phone with a touchscreen to the back of the PSP . It works , however you lose the UMD drive .
6 . PSP of the Future
R eached a deal with Samsung to purchase 8GB flash memory chips which will be built in according to industry reportsMiniature hard disk drives are out . It will be streamlined and thinner and lighter . Sony is still expected to include a still/video camera of undetermined resolution as a built-in feature of the new PSP .
7 . Amazing PSP Redesigned
A new PSP is n't likely to come any time soon . However , that has n't stopped this designer from making their own concept design . We have to admit , this is really quite attractive . When closed , the unit looks very iPhone-esque , with a sexy PlayStation button that would act like the PSP 's `` Home '' button .
8 . Another PSP Phone Concept
It looks like it 's a dual slider that slides up for the phone keypad or at an angle for the PSP controls . Sure , you might lose the UMD slot with this design , but it 's on its way out already , so by the time this phone would be released , you should be good to go .
9 . Interfacing with the PSP Remote port
Why is having serial communications between a PSP and a PC an interesting feat ?
This is interesting because it can provide us with a very wide array of facilities :
- Debug output for application development :
This is already happening - Check out the excellent PSPLink by TyRaNiD !
- Serial console for any Linux port ( a must-have device indeed ! ) or any other applications
- The serial protocol is a simple , well known and robust protocol , with loads of existing applications ready to be used . You could even use a PSP for dial up access or GPS !
- Hijacking the UART4 PSP driver to use the Remote UART might give us access to the low level debug functions of the PSP without the need to tear it apart in order to access the internal UART4
Also :
- The remote is a very optional device for the PSP = > it can be used for other purposes ( eg . debug ) without interfering with standard operations ( USB , WiFi , ... )
- As a serial device , IRDA could be used as well , but not everybody has an IRDA receiver . On the other hand , almost every computer out there has a serial port ( sorry Mac users - this is the one thing that Apple did get wrong ! )
- The cable is very inexpensive/simple to build ( see below ) , and not doubt someone out there will be selling ready made cables for the PSP at some stage
- Rumoured additional capabilities of the Remote Port like re-flash ( this is very doubtful , but who knows ... )
- The Remote driver is probably the best driver to experiment with for development ( low footprint , simple , loads of serial code samples out there )
10 . CollecTic - Interactive PSP Game
Jonas Hielscher has developed an interactive PSP game called `` CollecTic '' , which basically `` has you running around outside trying to collect WLAN access points with your portable '' . Video after the jump .
11 . PSP Robot Remote v0.3
Netoo is back at it again , he 's released a version 0.3 of their PSP Robot Remote . This version includes a new graphical menu and other goodies that you 'll see in the video .
12 . PSP Motion Sensor
A modder has managed to create a motion sensor for the PSP -- running the game Mercury .
13 . PSP-Controlled Honda Civic
American amp specialists Metro Electrics have taken PSP hacking to a new level with a concept car they showcased at the recent CES 2006 .
The former '94 Honda Civic was given a funky paint-job , hollowed out and packed with a working electric engine , 24 LCD screens , `` more speakers than an Aerosmith concert '' and three amps . They also made it remote-controllable by PSP ; with a Wi-Fi connection you can use the handheld to open the doors , switch the lights and even drive the thing down the road ( igniq ) .

On August 26th , Conor McGregor will face Floyd Mayweather at the T Mobile Arena in Las Vegas .
In what is shaping up to be the most expensive fight in boxing or MMA history , many are predicting a poor performance from McGregor . However , if their social media is anything to go by , what we know is both fighters are gunning for a win .
Many will agree that McGregor is fighting an uphill battle . Mayweather has a flawless record of 49-0 and McGregor has never fought in a professional boxing match . Recent footage suggests that McGregor is up to the task . Showing all the qualities of what makes them so great in UFC , McGregor looks poised . But could a change of equipment put McGregor at a disadvantage ?
Many aspects of the preparation for the fight will be the same for McGregor : diet , training and analyzing their opponent ; a key difference will be the gloves they are wearing . Previously McGregor has fought and trained in the standard MMA gloves . With exposed fingers and around a centimetre of leather and padding protecting the fighter 's hands , these gloves are made for speed and are needed for incorporating grappling and holding into an MMA fight . McGregor has shown their dominance using them many times over . The lightness has allowed them to deliver quick and deadly blows , changing them could be a real test .

Buffalo Sabres GM Darcy Regier announced today the Sabres have agreed to terms with unrestricted free agent defenseman Shaone ( pronounced SHAWN ) Morrisonn on a two-year contract .
Morrisonn ( 12/23/1982 , 6 ' 4 ” , 217 lbs. , shoots left ) has spent the last five seasons with Washington . The 27-year-old was consistently among Washington 's leaders in hits and blocked shots throughout their career , including 163 hits and 104 blocks last season . In 418 career games with Washington and Boston , Morrisonn has 70 points ( 10+60 ) , 423 PIMs and is a plus-36 .
A native of Vancouver , BC , Morrisonn was originally drafted in the first round ( 19th overall ) by Boston in the 2001 Entry Draft . They were traded to Washington in March 2004 in the deal that sent Sergei Gonchar to the Bruins . Morrisonn played their junior hockey with the WHL 's Kamloops Blazers .
ONLY the drunk , they say , drive in a straight line in Chicago . The sober zigzag to avoid falling into the city 's axle-breaking potholes . This year the craters , caused by continual freezing and thawing , are worse than ever , and the spring thaw has brought three times the usual number of complaints from citizens .
As winter retreats , holes in roads and budgets are being revealed—especially in midwestern states , which were hit hard by the polar vortex . Those states with money have made emergency appropriations for repairs ; those without will have to cut summer programmes . This means not mowing the grass in parks or picking up litter . It also means delaying resurfacing of highways or fixing guard rails , and putting off capital spending .

Looking after America 's roads is a persistent headache . Although $ 91 billion is spent on them every year , that is nowhere near enough to keep the country 's 4.1m miles ( 6.6m km ) of public roadways in good nick . The Federal Highway Administration estimates that $ 170 billion in capital investment is needed every year . Last year a report from a civil-engineering group said that 32 % of America 's major roads were in poor or mediocre condition . Main roads through cities were in the worst shape : almost half the miles travelled over urban interstates in 2013 were a bumpy ride . Ray LaHood , a former transport secretary , thinks the roads are probably in the worst shape they have ever been .
You shook me all night long
Highway finance comes from two main sources : cities and states , and the federal Highway Trust Fund ( HTF ) . The HTF spends $ 46 billion a year and is funded by a tax of 18.4 cents on each gallon of petrol . But revenues are declining : the young drive a bit less and cars burn fuel more efficiently . Since American voters hate energy taxes , the petrol tax has not increased since 1993 and its purchasing power has declined . Adjusted for inflation , it is now worth only 11.5 cents . Had it been indexed to inflation 20 years ago ( says the Centre for American Progress , a leftish think-tank ) , it would now be 29 cents a gallon .
The transport department reckons the highway fund will dip below $ 4 billion in July . That is the minimum the administration says it needs to help states meet day-to-day expenses . The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials says Congress must come up with $ 15 billion-17 billion to keep the fund solvent next year . It could either patch up the fund with another tranche of money—as it has done in the past—or refinance it by raising the petrol tax and linking this to inflation . So far , it has done neither . Options are narrow : a Gallup poll last year found that two-thirds of Americans opposed a rise in the federal petrol tax for any reason .
States also levy their own taxes , and some , such as Michigan , have been able to increase their road budgets . Massachusetts , together with Maryland and Wyoming , has managed to put up its petrol tax . Pennsylvania has imposed a tax on petrol wholesalers , which—officials seem to hope—may be less visible at the pump . In Ohio toll-revenue bonds have been issued . In Missouri a 1 % increase in the sales tax for ten years has been proposed , though it may not become law . ( A state representative remarked sardonically that 40 % of Missourians would oppose a new tax even if it was being used “ to construct the landing pad for the second coming of Christ ” . )
Other states , however , can not cope without a large federal infusion . This may be because they have lots of roads and not many people to tax , or because their finances are shaky , like Rhode Island 's . In testimony to Congress in March , Rhode Island 's director of transport said that if historical funding levels were not restored , and even with increased local investment , the state would be “ managing the decline of its infrastructure ” . Sue Minter , the deputy secretary of Vermont 's transport department , warned that “ project delays will become cancellations ” .
The HTF will probably be patched up ; this is , after all , an election year . But states are worried . In Arkansas ten projects worth $ 60m—such as two bridge replacements in Pulaski County , round Little Rock , and the widening of north-south Route 63—have been taken off a list scheduled for funding this April . In Colorado plans to add a third lane to the I-25 between Denver and Fort Collins are in doubt , as the $ 1 billion project needs federal support .
Some states wonder whether tolling might raise revenue for new roads . Illinois recently won planning approval for a $ 1.3 billion toll road to Indiana . Forty-two states and the District of Columbia now have some sort of tolling authority . These are increasingly popular ways of financing new roads , although the slight decline in driving , and an unwillingness to pay high fees , have threatened this model in some cases . The Intercounty Connector , built to ease congestion in the suburbs of Washington , DC , costs $ 8 for a round trip and has failed to meet traffic projections .
Moreover , federal law does not allow tolling on existing interstates . The US Tolling Coalition , a lobby group of building companies and contractors , would like Congress to give more states the chance . But a new anti-toll lobby called the Alliance for Toll-Free Interstates ( mostly composed of shipping companies ) wants to prevent it , and any change in federal law will be fiercely tussled over .
Some argue that America needs to borrow more to pay for better infrastructure . This is already happening . The new $ 3.9 billion Tappan Zee bridge over the Hudson river in New York is financed with bonds that will be paid for by tolls . A $ 2.5 billion project , the North Tarrant Expressway in Fort Worth , Texas , borrowed $ 531m from a federal fund known as TIFIA ( the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act ) , set up in 1998 to provide loans or lines of credit for improvements to “ eligible transportation surfaces ” .
Down payment blues
Loans must still be repaid , whether from tolls or taxes . Yet citizens seem to be more willing to stump up for local roads through local initiatives , whether higher taxes or vehicle-registration fees . Ken Orski , a transport analyst , points out that on election day in 2013 70 % of ballot measures to increase or extend funding for surface transport were approved . Last year , voters in Arkansas agreed to a half-cent increase in the sales tax for highway improvements . The way ahead , perhaps ?
OKPay – the payment-processing company – has told customers it will stop processing bitcoin transactions .
Providing customers with no more than a one-lined statement that reads : “ Dear customers , we are currently suspending bitcoin processing , ” OKPay has left its partners and customers confused about what lies behind the decision .
Mt . Gox – the largest bitcoin exchange , based in Tokyo – released a statement to say it is stopping transactions accordingly but is unsure what is happening behind the scenes . The statement said :
“ Mt . Gox has recently been informed by OKPay , one of our longtime partners , that they are planning to stop performing wire transfers to and from all Bitcoin exchanges , including Mt . Gox . OKPay is offering a solution , but in the meantime we want to make sure that Mt . Gox customers and the Bitcoin community are well-informed about this development . While we are not completely clear about the dates of the transition , we would like to make a couple of points clear :
We will soon stop accepting deposits via OKPay . This may take up to a couple of weeks , but it will happen eventually .
Withdrawals to OKPay accounts will not be cut immediately , but will only be allowed up to the amount that OKPay users have deposited into Mt . Gox via OKPay . Beyond that amount there are other methods of withdrawal available .
Mt . Gox wishes the best to OKPay , and we look forward to working together more closely in the future . The Bitcoin economy is going through many changes recently , and we are positive that they will ultimately work themselves out in the best interests of the community and the World . ”
Back in February 2007 , medi-pot advocates were feeling optimistic that access to research-grade pot for use in Food and Drug Administration-approved studies might soon be opening up – and for good reason . That month , Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner ruled in favor of allowing University of Massachusetts-Amherst professor Lyle Craker to begin growing a new crop of pot that would be available for research into the medicinal value of marijuana , with the ultimate goal of developing an FDA-approved medi-pot .
Craker initially applied to the Drug Enforce­ment Administration for permission to grow the test crop in 2001 . After three years of bureauczratic delays , the agency concluded in 2004 that Craker 's request should be denied . Craker , backed by the Multidisci­plin­ary Assoc­i­ation for Psychedelic Studies ( a research outfit that aims to develop government-approved prescription drugs from controlled substances such as LSD , MDMA or Ecstasy , and pot ) , appealed that decision , which was heard by Bittner during nine days of testimony spread out over two months in 2005 . A year and a half later , Bittner weighed in , agreeing that Craker should be granted permission to grow .
That pleased medi-pot advocates but was n't the end of the story . Bittner 's findings were nonbinding , so it would ultimately fall to DEA administrators to decide whether to accept their conclusions . On Jan. 7 , Michele Leonhart , a DEA dep­uty administrator , finally weighed in on the matter , rejected Bittner 's conclusions , and again denied Craker 's application . Craker said the DEA decision was a `` disappointment , '' but , `` I do n't think we need to be surprised '' by it .
In a 118-page rejection letter , Leonhart concludes that Craker 's bid to grow research pot is `` precluded under Federal law , '' because , among other related reasons , they were unable to demonstrate to the agency that an additional source of research marijuana was actually needed to meet demand . ( Read the DEA 's rejection letter with this story below . ) Indeed , since 1968 , the University of Mississippi has held the only contract to grow pot for government-approved purposes – including providing pot for remaining participants of a federal medi-pot study group and for research approved by the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( part of the National Institutes of Health ) , which actually doles out the dope to researchers . The arrangement means the dope is essentially under constant control of the feds , which is what is called for under the United Nations ' Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs , to which the U.S. is a party .
Moreover , Leonhart writes in their opinion that no one much has complained about the quantity or quality of the Ole Miss dope and notes that as of 2005 , the university had under its control some 1,055 kilograms ( 2,326 pounds ) of the stuff in storage . In fact , they write , there 's so much in reserve that they have n't actually had to cultivate any new dope since 1997 . `` For the reasons indicated above , I have determined that [ Craker 's ] proposed registration [ to grow ] is inconsistent with United States obligations under the Single Convention and with the public interest , '' Leonhart concluded .
While the DEA may not see a need to grow additional pot for research , Crak­er , head of the UMass Medicinal Plant Program ; Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies founder and President Rick Doblin ; at least 47 members of Congress ( including Massachusetts Sens . John Kerry and Ted Kennedy ) ; and a broad swath of public health organizations – including the Lymphoma Foun­dation of America , the National Assoc­ia­tion for Public Health Policy , the Multiple Scler­osis Foundation , and the California Med­ical Assoc­iation – disagree . Despite what the DEA thinks , the product provided by the University of Missis­sippi is inconsistent in quality , and the manner by which the government determines who will get pot for research is confounding . `` We believe that marijuana should be treated like any other potential therapeutic medicine , with researchers having the ability to obtain it and test it , within federally-approved scientific research protocols , '' Dr. Jack Lewin , former CEO of the California Medical Association , wrote in a 2005 letter of support for Craker . `` To date , it has generally not been treated that way , causing significant problems in the research into marijuana as a potential medicine . It is in the public interest to allow the scientific process to determine whether marijuana should be available as a medicine for sick patients who may need it , and DEA licensing of appropriate and qualified researchers is crucial to facilitate that process . ''
Craker finds the entire process frustrating . On one hand , the government remains skeptical about medical marijuana until solid research can prove otherwise , yet it continues putting up roadblocks to prevent progress on that front . `` If there is no medical benefit [ from marijuana ] , then it would be to [ the government 's ] advantage to have it tested , '' Craker told the Chronicle .
Allen Hopper , the litigation director for the ACLU 's Drug Law Reform Project , which is representing Craker , said the attorneys are still reviewing the DEA decision . Whether they will now appeal the decision directly to the U.S. appeals court for the District of Columbia circuit or will seek additional review within the DEA has not been decided . Hopper said that in their decision , Leonhart raises `` evidence '' never addressed in the hearings with Bittner , which may need to be addressed with the agency before moving the case to the federal court .
As frustrating as the entire experience has been , Craker vows not to give up : `` The struggle is still in its beginning stages . ''

Does Dunkin Donuts really think its customers could mistake Rachael Ray for a terrorist sympathizer ? The Canton-based company has abruptly canceled an ad in which the domestic diva wears a scarf that looks like a keffiyeh , a traditional headdress worn by Arab men .
Some observers , including ultra-conservative Fox News commentator Michelle Malkin , were so incensed by the ad that there was even talk of a Dunkin Donuts boycott .
The keffiyeh , for the clueless , is the traditional scarf of Arab men that has come to symbolize murderous Palestinian jihad ,  Malkin yowls in their syndicated column .
Popularized by Yasser Arafat and a regular adornment of Muslim terrorists appearing in beheading and hostage-taking videos , the apparel has been mainstreamed by both ignorant and not-so-ignorant fashion designers , celebrities , and left-wing icons.
The company at first pooh-poohed the complaints , claiming the black-and-white wrap was not a keffiyeh . But the right-wing drumbeat on the blogosphere continued and by yesterday , Dunkin Donuts decided itd be easier just to yank the ad .
Said the suits in a statement : In a recent online ad , Rachael Ray is wearing a black-and-white silk scarf with a paisley design . It was selected by their stylist for the advertising shoot . Absolutely no symbolism was intended . However , given the possibility of misperception , we are no longer using the commercial.
( In case youre wondering , the stylist who selected the offending scarf was not Gretta Enterprises boss Gretchen Monahan , who appears on Rays TV show as a style consultant . )
For their part , Malkin was pleased with Dunkins response : Its refreshing to see an American company show sensitivity to the concerns of Americans opposed to Islamic jihad and its apologists.

Developers of the swanky and wildly popular student towers near Georgia Tech might want to invest in extra-sensitive smoke alarms . An analysis of Georgia Tech police crime reports by Technique , the school 's newspaper , found that , `` If you drink alcohol underage or smoke marijuana in your room at Tech , you are unlikely to be arrested '' — findings that probably come as a relief on this ceremonious day . The newspaper studied crime logs from the beginning of the fall semester through March , and statistics show that Tech students are either extraordinarily well-behaved , or veritable ninjas when it comes to not getting caught . Or maybe it 's that the North Avenue Trade School is like a mini-Colorado in some respects — as one alleged scofflaw recently told police .
During the six-month period in question , Tech police logged 67 alcohol cases not related to driving . Only two of those resulted in an arrest — and just one involved a student arrest . In the latter case , the combo charge of criminal trespass could help explain why the Techie was booked , the newspaper found .
When it comes to marijuana-related cases , about half of the 25 instances resulted in an arrest . But of those , interestingly , only one involved marijuana possession by a student who was n't driving or in a car . One report shows that a marijuana possession suspect at the school had no fear of getting caught , telling police `` he heard from friends that Georgia Tech Police , unlike other colleges , do n't make arrests for marijuana ( and ) stated this is why they kept and smoked marijuana on campus , '' according to a police report .
It turns out there 's some validity to that stoner logic .
The school 's Interim Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students told the newspaper that most first-time offenders for alcohol and marijuana get either probation or a warning . A police official added that students caught with less than one ounce of reefer wo n't face arrest — but will be dealt with internally via student affairs and housing offices .

This infamous , blood-red R34 Nissan Skyline GT-R by legendary tuning house MCR ( Matchless Crowd Racing ) needs little introduction . With more than 600 horsepower and a trick scramble-boost function that increases boost pressure for a short period , Shinichi Kobayashi 's Skyline GT-R is a terror on the Tsukuba circuit , setting a lap time of 59.888 seconds , and losing out to Mine 's R34 Skyline GT-R by just fractions of a second during the Tuned Silvia & Skyline Face Off ( Check out MCR 's race here ) .
But to test its mettle on the street , Kobayashi brought their MCR GT-R to Hot Version 's Gunsai Showdown , where it faced a fresh competitor : a then-new 350Z tuned by Powerhouse Amuse . Could the hefty , naturally-aspirated coupe with a grand-touring reputation stand a chance against MCR 's turbocharged monster ?
By comparison , the 350Z stepped into the ring with some relatively light mods ( literally ) . Amuse give the Z an extensive weight-loss plan , including dry carbon hood and doors , lightweight seats , and a titanium exhaust that brought the Z 's weight down to 2,900 pounds . For Amuse , balance is the key to street tuning .
With wet conditions on the tight and twisty Gunsai Touge , MCR must have been feeling pretty smug with the GT-R 's more stable AWD . However , the lightly tuned Amuse 350Z managed to completely gap MCR in the lead run , and shadow the GT-R in every corner during the chase run . This is a classic David vs. Goliath , and the 350Z executed a stunning upset that no doubt sent Kobayashi back to the drawing board .
The Nissan 350Z is relatively quick , but for whatever reason , it never enjoyed the same amount of adoration as the Honda S2000 or Porsche Cayman . Now , early 350Z models are quite a performance bargain and could go for as low as $ 5,000 . Are you tempted to build your own Amuse-spec Z33 track car now ?
Check out the vintage Hot Version videos ( race begins at 7:20 mark ) , including a walk around the Z33 with the late Amuse founder Hideki Tanabe , below :

NEW YORK , Jan 22 ( Reuters ) - Wall Street 's two marquee investment banks each slightly cut their chief executives ' pay after a year that saw profitability fall and shares drop amid a turbulent backdrop .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and their Morgan Stanley counterpart James Gorman saw their overall compensation fall in 2015 .
Blankfein 's overall pay declined 4 percent from the year prior to $ 23 million , while Gorman 's slid 7 percent to $ 21 million , the banks disclosed on Friday .
Both banks have struggled with tumultous markets that hurt bond trading and underwriting , concerns about oil prices and sluggish growth in China .
The pay declines come in contrast to a 35 percent raise for JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon . Dimon 's compensation surged to $ 27 million , although the cash portion was cut and three quarters of the total was tied to performance-based stock awards .
Return on equity , a key measure of profitability , has been under pressure at both Goldman and Morgan . Goldman 's return on equity in particular slumped to 7.4 percent in 2015 , after a $ 5 billion settlement fourth-quarter hit related to its dealings with mortgage backed securities during the financial crisis .
Goldman typically leads peers with a return on equity of around 11 percent .
Rival Morgan Stanley , in contrast , generated a return on equity of 8.5 percent in 2015 , below Gorman 's target of 10 percent .
Morgan Stanley has tried to improve profitability in its fixed income division which has dragged down the firm 's overall returns and said it would cut 25 percent of its headcount in the unit . It also announced a $ 1 billion cost cutting initiative to rely more on outsourcing and technology .
Shares of Goldman declined 8 percent in 2015 , making it the second worst performer of all the big U.S. banks after Morgan Stanley , which fell 18 percent .

Fisherman with a silver carp
Juvenile silver carp
The silver carp ( Hypophthalmichthys molitrix ) is a species of freshwater cyprinid fish , a variety of Asian carp native to China and eastern Siberia . [ 2 ] Although a threatened species in its natural habitat , it has long been cultivated in China . By weight more silver carp are produced worldwide in aquaculture than any other species of fish except for the grass carp . Silver carp are usually farmed in polyculture with other Asian carp , or sometimes with catla or other fish species .
The species has also been introduced to , or spread by connected waterways , into at least 88 countries around the world . The reason for importation was generally for use in aquaculture , but enhancement of wild fisheries and water quality control have also been intended on occasion . [ 3 ] In some of these places the species is considered an invasive species . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
The silver carp reaches an average length of 60–100 cm ( 24–39 in ) with a maximum length of 140 cm ( 55 in ) [ 7 ] and weight of 50 kg ( 110 lb ) . [ 2 ]
Diet [ edit ]
The silver carp is a filter feeder and possesses a specialized feeding apparatus capable of filtering particles as small as 4 µm . The gill rakers are fused into a sponge-like filter , and an epibranchial organ secretes mucus which assists in trapping small particles . A strong buccal pump forces water through this filter . Silver carp , like all Hypophthalmichthys species , have no stomachs ; they are thought to feed more or less constantly , largely on phytoplankton . They also consume zooplankton and detritus . In places where this plankton-feeding species has been introduced , they are thought to compete with native planktivorous fishes , which in North America include paddlefish ( Polyodon spathula ) , gizzard shad ( Dorosoma cepedianum ) , and young fish of almost all species . [ 8 ]
Because they feed on plankton , they are sometimes successfully used for controlling water quality , especially in the control of noxious blue-green algae ( cyanobacteria ) . Certain species of blue-green algae , notably the often toxic Microcystis , can pass through the gut of silver carp unharmed , picking up nutrients in the process . Thus , in some cases , blue-green algae blooms have been exacerbated by silver carp . Microcystis has also been shown to produce more toxins in the presence of silver carp . These carp , which have natural defenses to their toxins , sometimes can contain enough algal toxins in their systems to become hazardous to eat . [ 8 ]
Ecology and conservation [ edit ]
The silver carp in its natural range migrates upstream for spawning ; eggs and larvae then drift downstream , and young fish hatch in the floodplain zone . Larvae and small juveniles feed on zooplankton , switching to phytoplankton once a certain size is reached . The species is somewhat sensitive to low oxygen conditions .
The species is currently classified as near threatened in it original range , as its habitat and reproductive behavior are impacted by construction of dams , pollution , and overfishing . Population declines appear to have been particularly significant in the Chinese parts of its range . [ 1 ]
Sport fishing [ edit ]
Silver carp are filter feeders , thus are difficult to catch on typical hook-and-line gear . Special methods have been developed for these fish , the most important being the `` suspension method '' , usually consisting of a large dough ball that disintegrates slowly , surrounded by a nest of tiny hooks embedded in the bait . [ 8 ] The entire apparatus is suspended below a large bobber . The fish feed on the small particles released from the dough ball and bump against the dough ball , with the intention of breaking off more small particles that can be filtered from the water , eventually becoming hooked on the tiny hooks . [ citation needed ]
In some areas , it is also legal to use `` snagging gear '' , in which large , weighted treble hooks are jerked through the water , to snag the fish . In the United States , silver carp are also popular targets for bowfishermen ; they are shot both in the water and in the air . In the latter case , boats are used to scare the fish and entice them to jump , and the fish are shot when they jump . [ citation needed ]
Related species [ edit ]
Two other species are in the genus Hypophthalmichthys , the bighead carp ( H. nobilis ) and the largescale silver carp ( H. harmandi ) . The genus name Aristichthys has also sometimes been used for bighead carp , but is deprecated . [ 9 ] The bighead carp differs from the silver carp in its behavior ( it does not leap from the water when startled ) and also in its diet . Bighead carp are also filter feeders , but they filter larger particles than silver carp and in general consume a greater proportion of zooplankton in their diets than silver carp , which consume more phytoplankton . In at least some parts of the United States , bighead and silver carp hybridize in the wild and produce fertile offspring . [ citation needed ]
The largescale silver carp is closely related to the silver carp , but its native range is to the south of that of the silver carp , mostly within Vietnam . Unlike bighead and silver carp , largescale silver carp have not been widely introduced around the world for use in aquaculture , although at least one introduction was made to some waters of the Soviet Union , where they hybridized with the introduced silver carp . [ citation needed ]
In North America [ edit ]
Silver carp were imported to North America in the 1970s to control algae growth in aquaculture and municipal wastewater treatment facilities , but escaped from captivity soon after their importation [ 4 ] and are now considered a highly invasive species . [ 10 ]
Silver carp , with the closely related bighead carp , often reach extremely high population densities , and are thought to have undesirable effects on the environment and native species . [ 6 ] They have spread into the Mississippi , Illinois , Ohio , Tennessee , and Missouri Rivers and many of their tributaries in the United States and are abundant in the Mississippi River watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota and Illinois . Navigation dams seem to have slowed their advance up the Mississippi River , and until late November 2008 , silver carp had not been captured north of central Iowa on the Mississippi . [ 11 ] Dams that do not have navigation locks are complete barriers to upstream natural movement of silver carp , unless fishermen unintentionally assist this movement by the use of silver carp as bait . [ 4 ]
The silver carp is sometimes called the flying carp for its tendency to leap from the water when startled ; it can leap up to 10 ft ( 3.0 m ) into the air . [ 12 ] Boaters traveling in uncovered high-speed watercraft have been reported to be injured by running into the fish while at speed . A leaping silver carp broke the jaw of a teenager being pulled on an inner tube , [ 12 ] and water skiing in areas where silver carp are present is extremely dangerous . [ 13 ]
In a rare twist , Google was quick to update a changelog on the Play Store , and this one is definitely worth it . Some big improvements have been made to the Chromecast ( Google Cast ) support in the latest update to Play Music , including some stability improvements , gapless playback , and continuous playback after a caster leaves the area . On top of that , a look inside turned up evidence that Google may soon allow users to `` gift '' subscriptions to other people . If you just ca n't wait to get the goods , we 've got a download link at the bottom .
What 's New
It 's highly unusual , but a changelog was posted right away with the release of the latest update .
v6.0.1995S We 've completely overhauled our Chromecast integration : No more stoppage of playback in between songs
Gapless playback support now enabled over Cast
Music will continue playing even if your phone turns off or if you need to leave your amazing house party ( brought to you by Unexpected Best Night Ever Radio† ) to pick up additional supplies †Listen for free in the US here : https : //goo.gl/Km8TUq
Gapless Playback
Google Play Music has had a rough history with gapless playback . There was no sign of the feature when the service and app first launched . After many complaints , partial support for gapless playback appeared , but it was inconsistent across devices and required configuration changes to get it working correctly . Eventually , those bugs were ironed out , but gapless playback never made the transition to Google Cast support , until now . The latest update changes that for users as they stream to an Android TV or Chromecast .
Note : This is just gapless playback , which means tracks are supposed to be played in succession with absolutely no delay between the end of one and the beginning of the next . This does not perform any special manipulation to force songs to play seamlessly if they have silence recorded at the beginning or end of the track .
Continuous Playback After A Caster Leaves
Chromecast users will see another common complaint resolved with this update . The problem occurs when a casting device is turned off or leaves the area while it 's running through a playlist – let 's say the owner goes to the store for ice . The currently playing song will finish , and then playback stalls , even if there are more songs left in the playlist .
That behavior should be a thing of the past . Under the latest update , Chromecast gets a copy of the current playlist and it will continue playing through to the end . I tested this and found that not only does the music continue playing as it should , but when the casting device returned , it automatically re-synced with the Chromecast and restored the session so the Caster could pause , skip , or scrub freely .
Playback Stability
Rounding out the list of Chromecast-specific improvements , the changelog also claims there 's a fix to a common problem that notoriously caused playback to stop in between songs . No reason for the issue was given , but it has been a regular complaint for quite a while and has been attributed to poor network conditions and devices with aggressive sleep policies . I would n't be surprised if this was fixed by storing the playlist for the continuous playback feature above .

Play Music Subscription Gifting
If you read the title and thought it was a joke , or just did n't believe it was possible ... Believe me , I know how you feel . Nevertheless , it 's real . Three new strings and an item in the Settings screen ( which is currently disabled ) have been added and they spell it out as clearly as possible : we 'll be able to `` Give a Google Play Music subscription '' to other people .
This is the only information available for now , so there 's not enough to go on for a guess at how gifting subscriptions will work , but we 'll keep an eye out for more as it comes along .
< PreferenceScreen android : title= '' @ string/send_gift '' android : key= '' @ string/gift_subscription_setting_key '' android : summary= '' @ string/gift_subscription_setting_summary '' / > < string name= '' gift_subscription_setting_key '' > gift_subscription_setting_key < /string >
< string name= '' gift_subscription_setting_summary '' > Give a Google Play Music subscription < /string >
< string name= '' send_gift '' > Send gift < /string >
So , let me get this straight – we ca n't buy apps , books , movies , or even individual songs for other people , but we 'll be able to give them a music subscription ? Come on , Google , can you please just give us app gifting already ?

( CNN ) Is Formula One 's female trailblazer Susie Wolff about to park their ambitions to race ?
The 32-year-old -- who is married to Mercedes ' motorsport boss Toto Wolff -- is the leading woman driver in F1 but told CNN they are now considering abandoning the sport because of a lack of opportunities .
As a test driver for the Williams team , Wolff became the first woman in more than 20 years to take part in an F1 weekend when they drove in four Friday practice sessions during the 2014 and 2015 seasons .
But Wolff is no closer to racing against their male peers in F1 , and a female racer has still not driven when it really counts -- in a grand prix -- since Italian Lella Lombardi competed in the 1970s .
`` I ca n't wait on the sidelines forever for my chance , '' Wolff told a special `` Women in F1 '' edition of CNN 's The Circuit
`` There does n't seem to be many opportunities for next year to get onto the grid . This is going to be a winter of reflection because either it happens or it does n't . ''

Asked how confident they were of ever making it onto the F1 grid , Wolff responded : `` I 'm very ambitious but I 'm also very realistic .
`` It 's going to be tough . It 's going to be very tough . ''
Claire Williams , the deputy team principal of their father 's historic race team and a supporter of Wolff , told CNN that , just like every other driver on the grid , Wolff still had to prove they had the ability to earn a seat in F1 .
`` Susie has to keep working hard , '' Williams explained . `` She has to make sure she 's the full package they can be . At the moment Susie is our test driver . We 'll see where we end up at the end of the season . ''

A golden opportunity seemed to be on the horizon for Wolff when Williams ' Valtteri Bottas injured their back and had to sit out the season-opening Australian Grand Prix
But instead of announcing Wolff as the Finn 's replacement for the next race in Malaysia , the team unveiled former F1 driver Adrian Sutil , who had no affiliations with Williams , as its reserve to stand in if required .
`` It was n't the best time of my career , '' reflected Wolff . `` It was certainly tough .
`` My first thought was for Valtteri , who is a good friend , but being an egoistic racing driver my second thought was , 'OK , would I get the chance ? '
`` There was a lot spoken about it in the media . Adrian has n't driven or tested the car so it was a lot of hot air about nothing in the end .
`` At the time when Adrian was announced , of course it was n't great for me . It just made me more determined to do a good job when I got in the car . ''

The media criticism came because the team was perceived to have overlooked Wolff in favor of Sutil .
Claire Williams explained to CNN : `` We needed someone that was race ready . They had to have been in a race seat with previous history . ''

At the time , Wolff also did n't have a super-licence , a requirement for all participants in a grand prix under the rules set out by the sport 's governing body , the FIA .
But CNN asked whether other forces , perhaps related to their gender and which did n't want to see Wolff line up on the F1 grid , were also at work ?
`` You have to see both sides of the story , '' the level-headed Wolff answered . `` If I put myself in the shoes of the team , they had a car that was quick enough for a podium and they had a test driver that had never driven an F1 race before .
`` They wanted someone with race experience in the car , and I can see that side of the argument .

Wolff joined the ranks of F1 as a development driver with Williams in 2012 after an impressive six-year spell competing in the popular German touring car championship .
In their junior karting days they competed against current F1 world champion , and fellow Briton , Lewis Hamilton .

But while Hamilton has gone on to win two world titles at the top tier of motorsport , one with McLaren and one under Wolff 's husband at Mercedes , the Scot is left contemplating their future .
`` Ultimately it 's the one question left in F1 , '' they mused . `` Can a female compete at this level , at this time ?
`` There were trailblazers in the past but why has n't there been a woman for so long ? ''
If Wolff decides to hang up their race suit at the end of the 2015 season the chances of seeing a female racer line up against their male peers seem further away than ever .
Most vanity plates are pretty benign , a little seven-letter puzzle of numbers and letters that reveals driver 's love of the Cubs or dachshunds or Quidditch . This list of revoked ( and sometimes reinstated ) plates is a little more controversial than that . Check out 11 letter combos that would definitely make your head turn if you spotted them on the highway .
1 . GOES211
Anyone who 's even vaguely familiar with This is Spinal Tap knows that “ Goes to 11 ” is referring to an amplifier . It would seem that a man named Johnny Dixon is unfamiliar with David St. Hubbins or Nigel Tufnel , because they wrote the Washington Department of Licensing to complain when they saw those plates . “ I find it in poor taste that the great state of Washington would issue a plate that allows a driver to insinuate in public that their penis grows to 11 inches in length , ” their complaint letter said . “ The rest of the citizens of Washington should not be subjected to this vulgarity. ” The owner of the license plate was ultimately allowed to keep it . “ The complaint was , pardon my pun , a stretch , ” said Department of Licensing spokesperson Brad BenfIeld .
2 . GOTMILF
You 'd think that most people are aware of the meaning of “ MILF ” ever since American Pie invaded our vernacular and forever tainted our image of wholesome baked goods . The good people of the Washington State Department of Licensing , however , were clueless when they received an application for a personalized plate that read “ GOTMILF , ” along with the explanation that “ MILF ” meant “ Manual Inline Lift Fluctuator. ” After other motorists called to complain , the man explained that “ GOTMILF ” really stood for “ Got Married Into Lisa 's Family ” and was allegedly a wedding present for their wife . The department of licensing did n't buy the excuse the second time around . The man 's second choice , by the way , was “ SUPL8EZ . ”
3 . ISNOGOD
North Dakotan Brian Magee , co-host of a radio show called “ Amplified Atheist , ” applied for a license plate declaring their religious beliefs ( or lack thereof ) in 2010 . It was denied . After an appeal process that included a trip to the North Dakota Attorney General , Magee won the right to put the plates on their Grand Cherokee . Steven Miles , an atheist in Florida , had a similar experience . Their 1994 Camry had proudly declared “ ATHEIST ” for 16 years when the state revoked the plates after receiving a letter of complaint signed by 12 individuals . The DMV eventually reversed the judgment and allowed Miles to keep the plates .
4 . MPEACHW
In 2007 , South Dakotan Heather Morijah and their boyfriend got his-and-hers license plates . Theirs said “ IMPCH W ” and theirs read “ MPEACHW. ” A few months later , Morijah got a letter from the DMV stating that they had to surrender the plate within 10 days due to complaints . On the advice of their lawyer , Morijah went to the media . The DMV refused to back down , publicly stating that they might be forced to make law enforcement collect the plates if they would n't give them up voluntarily . That 's when the national media got involved , including CNN . The ACLU of the Dakotas sent the DMV a letter about censoring political speech , and miraculously , the decision was reversed a couple of days later .
5 . IB6UB9
Robert Anaya of New Mexico had been tooling around the state with “ IB6UB9 ” license plates for close to three years before the Taxation and Revenue Department understood the sexual reference . Anaya claims it 's an inside joke from a night out at a casino with friends and is currently fighting to get their plates back .
6 . ILVTOFU
The Colorado DMV nixed a vegan 's seven-letter love note to everyone 's favorite bean curd in 2009 . “ We do n't allow FU because some people could read that as street language for sex , ” a Department of Revenue spokesperson said . The woman who hoped to own the license plate was slightly bewildered . “ My whole family is vegan so tofu is like a staple for us , ” they told the Denver Post . But she 's not alone : Tennessee , Florida and Virgina have all rejected `` ILVTOFU '' plates .
7 . FOSAMA
F Osama ? Not if the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles has anything to say about it ( and it turns out they do ) . Even though Rick Sanders had been driving the anti-Osama Bin Laden plates for more than seven years , the DMV sent them a letter in 2012 explaining that they made a mistake in issuing them . Sanders played slightly coy about what the “ F ” meant : “ It can be anything you want—fight Osama , forget Osama , or ... anything you want. ” Nevertheless , they stopped using the plates and received replacements from the DMV—a set they happened to find offensive . “ 6668UP , ” they say , means “ The devil ate you up . ”
8 . NO ZOG
In 2009 , a group of Neo-Nazis were having a meeting in Oregon . Among the group of cars gathered at the meeting was one with the plate “ NO ZOG. ” Protesters noticed and issued complaints , which resulted in the plate being pulled . ZOG means “ Zionist Occupied Government '' and is a form of anti-Semitism . Jimmy Marr , the man who owned the plates , declined to explain why they chose such a sentiment and hung up on the reporter who called to ask .
9 . POOFTER
“ You may have grown fond of your personalized plates , ” the state of Virginia wrote in a letter to David Phillips in 2007 , but said they were being pulled for being “ socially , racially or ethnically offensive or disparaging. ” For those who do n't know their British slang , “ poofter ” refers to a gay man . Phillips had the plates on their car for more than a decade before the state realized what it meant . It 's less offensive , they say , than “ NANCBOY , ” which is what their car proclaimed—without issue or complaint—before they heard of the term “ poofter ” and changed their plates to that instead . “ It 's just an amusing word I self-identify with , ” Phillips said .
10 . LMAOATU
Brooke Bennett-Manas of Las Vegas had been amusing fellow drivers for more than four years before the DMV decided their vanity plates were n't so funny . But Bennett-Manas had the last laugh : the DMV reinstated their plates a few days later , saying the phrase did n't clearly fall into one of the prohibited categories .
11 . JUGALET
When a police officer spotted a 2003 Chevy Cavalier sporting these plates around Puyallup , Washington , they saw something other than an extreme Insane Clown Posse Fan proclaiming their enthusiasm for the band . Officer Mike Lusk saw a license plate that proclaimed enthusiasm for a criminal street gang . Juggalos , AKA fans of the band , have been officially classified as a non-traditional gang by the FBI and several states . The plate was revoked , as was another plate that read JUGGALO .

Hat tip : 101 Great Goals
Quartzsite residents who thought they voted in new municipal leadership found out otherwise last week when the Town Council decided not to seat Mayor-elect Ed Foster and Councilman-elect Mark Orgeron , claiming the two men are not eligible to hold office .
Incumbents contend that Foster , a former mayor who leads the opposing political faction , is ineligible because of an unpaid debt to the town . They refused to let Orgeron take office because they do not consider them to be a town resident .
`` I served in the military , and this is not the America that I raised my right hand and swore to defend , '' said Foster , who garnered 56 percent of the vote to easily defeat opponent Jerry Lukkasson .
Foster said they filed papers asking La Paz County Attorney Sam Vederman to file a writ under an obscure state law that allows a court to remove usurpers from public office and seat a legitimate candidate .
Orgeron said they have hired an attorney and filed a legal action , but they declined to provide details .
Vederman said Monday that they are studying options and should make a decision `` soon . '' Meanwhile , they said , the situation in Quartzsite is volatile enough that they worry about violence .
`` We 're exploring the entire situation , '' Vederman added . `` A lot of people are concerned there could be violations ( of Arizona law ) . I just want everyone to remain calm . ''
The election hullabaloo is just the latest political clash in the dusty desert town along Interstate 10 , the freeway to California . Years of feuding have resulted in numerous criminal and civil investigations .
Foster and about a dozen other critics of the establishment who have been jailed repeatedly say they are victims of false arrest and civil-rights violations . A town attorney was replaced last year after they refused to prosecute cases that they described as politically motivated .
Most of the town 's police officers were fired in 2011 after they accused Chief Jeffrey Gilbert of abusing their authority . Their complaint was referred by state police investigators to the Attorney General 's Office , which censured the Town Council for violating public-meeting laws .
The state ombudsman reprimanded the town for violating Arizona 's Public Records Law . State Bar complaints have been lodged against the new town attorney . Foster said they were interviewed recently by FBI agents investigating public officials .
Vice Mayor Barbara Cowell , who placed third in the election and would have been replaced by Orgeron , said they and other incumbents are fighting against disruptive newcomers .
`` All we 're trying to do is protect the people of Quartzsite , '' they said .
Jose Lizarraga , who was to be replaced as mayor but remains in office , did not respond to interview requests . According to town records , Lizarraga opposed the council 's decision to disqualify Foster and Orgeron .
Minutes from last week 's meeting indicate the council 's vote took place after a closed-door discussion , and no public explanation was given for the board 's decision .
In an interview , however , Cowell said Foster was disqualified because they failed to pay court-ordered attorney fees from a lawsuit they lost against the town .
Several years ago , Quartzsite adopted an ordinance banning municipal debtors from office . Foster and others contend the ordinance violates the rights of voters as well as candidates .
Ken Strobeck , executive director of the League of Arizona Cities and Towns , declined to comment on the legal question but said they know of no other municipality in the state with a similar candidate code .
Tim Casey , a Phoenix attorney who practices election law , said that , under Quartzsite 's ordinance , a resident could not hold office if they or they had an unpaid traffic ticket or was contesting a municipal fee .
`` I would think there would be a number of constitutional problems with that , '' Casey said . `` It would seem to be an impermissible limitation on public service and a violation of the will of voters . ''
Cowell said Orgeron was not seated because council members do not believe their legal residence is in Quartzsite . Orgeron teaches in the community and stays there five days each week , but they have a home in Yuma and was registered to vote there in the past year .
Orgeron said they have lived in Quartzsite since 2009 and considers it their residence .
`` I believe the current Town Council and city government have stifled the voters , '' they said . `` We need to turn that town back over to the people . ''
Casey said that residency questions hinge largely on subjective intent and that challenges from political rivals should be viewed skeptically : `` You have to be careful about using these things to exclude people who you do n't see as desirable . ''
Rob Dalager , another attorney experienced in election law , said it is unlikely that a judge would disqualify Orgeron based on an issue that was not even raised before the election .
`` Courts like to give pretty good deference to the voters , '' they noted .
The U.S. Census Bureau puts Quartzsite 's population at about 3,500 , with a median age of 67 .
But actual numbers fluctuate wildly from a few thousand people who brave the summer heat to about 1 million visitors during winter months when snowbirds are drawn to gem shows , craft events and swap meets .
The political furor is complicated by allegations of election fraud in a mayoral vote that tallied just 706 ballots .
Town Manager Alex Taft announced during this week 's council meeting that 168 votes are under investigation .
Cowell said they and other incumbents believe `` something is not right '' because about 300 new voters registered before the election , including some staying on federal lands .
`` We have proof that there were ( three ) people who were dead who voted , '' they added .
Cowell was unable to identify the investigator hired by the town or give details on how the person was selected or how much they or they are being paid .
`` I 'm not privy to that . It 's not my business , '' they said .
Cowell said they understand that Quartzsite 's code banning municipal debtors from office may be challenged in court .
`` If it finds out we are wrong , then we 'll seat him , '' they said . `` From my heart , I know we have not done anything illegal . ''
Likewise , Cowell said , they will be replaced on the council if a judge rules that Orgeron resides in Quartzsite . However , they noted , `` I am still in that position right now . ''
We know that Samsung is preparing to launch the 2017 edition of the Galaxy A family : A3 , A5 , and A7 . We brought you exclusive renders of the mid-sized Galaxy A5 ( 2017 ) – with its very familiar metal and glass design – and now according to rumors , its bigger sibling will come with a 16-megapixel front facing camera and an IP68 rating .
According to Sammobile , the 2017 edition of the Galaxy A7 – also known as SM-A720F – will feature a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a FHD resolution . That is a slight increase in size from last year 's model , which has a 5.5-inch screen . Under the hood , the A7 is said to be powered by Exynos 7870 Octa coupled with 3GB of RAM . The base model is likely to have 32GB of storage with support for microSD cards . The biggest changes are , however , its selfie-shooter and water-resistance .
If the recent AnTuTu benchmark results are true , we could be seeing a 16-megapixel front facing camera in the Galaxy A7 ( 2017 ) . My guess is this is going to be the same module we saw in the Galaxy C9 Pro , which launched with a 16-megapixel selfie-shooter with an aperture of f/1.9 . And Samsung will reportedly bring the IP68 rating found in the Galaxy S7 to the A7 , which means it 'll be dust-resistant and can be submerged in water for 30 minutes at depths of up to 1.5 meters .
My guess is this is going to be the same module we saw in the Galaxy C9 Pro , which launched with a 16-megapixel selfie-shooter with an aperture of f/1.9 .
Although there are no official words on when we would be seeing the 2017 refresh of the Galaxy A family , my guess would be around December . Last year 's models were released at the end of 2015 , so that would make the most sense . Based on the renders of the upcoming Galaxy A5 , its bigger sibling should also feature a USB Type-C port , but it 's not clear whether the 2017 Galaxy A model will launch with Marshmallow or Nougat . I 'm really hoping for the latter .

First visit since Conservatives came to power in 2010 signals improving relations despite Falklands dispute
Sir Alan Duncan will on Monday become the first Foreign Office minister to visit Argentina since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 in the strongest sign yet that Anglo-Argentinian relations are recovering despite the continuing dispute over the Falkland Islands .
Duncan will focus on improving business links , but will also hold a bilateral meeting with Argentinian officials on the Falklands . The UK wants to extend direct flights from the Falklands to South America beyond the current weekly flight from Chile . The flights are limited by Argentinian controls over its airspace . Argentina wants any new flights from the Falklands to be focused primarily on journeys to Buenos Aires .
The two sides are also likely to discuss rights to explore for hydrocarbons in the waters off the Falklands , including ideas for joint exploration raised by Susana Malcorra , the Argentinian foreign minister . At present Argentina imposes sanctions against companies seeking to cooperate with any British exploration .
Malcorra told the Guardian last week that they wanted to end the very confrontational approach of the previous administration of Cristina Kira Fernández de Kirchner .
They said the two countries agreed on 80 % of issues , and co-operating on those should not be blocked by those over which they differed .
The Argentinian claim to the islands , described as the Malvinas by Argentina in the country 's constitution , will not be revoked .
The UK Foreign Office said Duncan 's visit followed “ an improvement in relations between the UK and Argentina since the election of President Mauricio Macri last year . It marks an important step forward following more than a decade of difficulties under the isolationist approach of Argentina 's previous government .
“ This is important for Britain , because having a better relationship with Argentina also means we can get a better deal for the Falkland islanders . ”
During the two-day visit Duncan will attend a business and investment forum hosted by Macri in Buenos Aires and hold meetings with senior government ministers , including Malcorra and the deputy foreign minister Carlos Foradori .
The Argentinian economy is heavily dependent on the ailing Brazilian economy .
Duncan said : “ This is a positive time for the relationship between the UK and Argentina . Our countries have many deep links , including in culture and language , and I hope my visit will help us take a step forward together . ”

`` But do n't you see ? '' says this straw man ( whom I should clarify is no longer that New York Times columnist , but a new straw man we will call `` Gormand Cocksbain '' ) . `` The problem is that these protesters do n't know what they 're doing . They 're never going to make a difference if they keep inviting violence and being aggressive with their language and not respecting elders . It 's because I support Black Lives Matter and all those other SJW issues that I criticize their movement . '' And you 're not alone in saying that , Mr. Cocksbain . Mike Huckabee and even Dr. Martin Luther King 's niece have criticized Black Lives Matter for `` magnifying '' problems instead of trying to fix them .

And sure , it 's true that every Black Lives Matter protest makes people nervous about a violent outburst , and that leftist newspapers and even prominent leaders in the black religious community have accused them of inciting violence . It 's also true that members of the black community have spoken out publicly against them , accusing them of inciting more violence and calling them `` righteous murderers . '' Oh , wait -- sorry , I got my notes mixed up . Turns out all that stuff was actually true of the Civil Rights movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King . Gosh , this is so embarrassing . I should really learn how to use my backspace key .
Anyway , here 's something I feel like not enough people are saying : Regardless of whether or not you agree with # BlackLivesMatter , we 're not these protesters ' fucking moms . It 's not our job to make sure they 're polite . Social change and protest is messy , in part because it 's exposing a mess . They 're pulling up a rug that hides a lot of dust and dirt and blood and muck and other things we 'd rather continue to pretend is n't there . But that does n't mean we get to sit in our overstuffed chairs with our feet up on the coffee table saying , `` Oh , no no no , you 're pulling the rug back all wrong . You have to lift and tug and -- oh , Christ , just stop . Just stop . Do n't even bother pulling the rug back if you 're going to do it that way . No equal rights for you until you learn some manners , young lady . ''

Let 's be honest with ourselves for a second : The best part of having an opinion is angrily winning an argument . Triumphantly putting someone else in their place . Hurting someone we disagree with , and being able to be extra mean because we know they 're wrong about something important , and they had it coming . It 's one of the darkest part of human nature , and we indulge it every time we pretend we give a shit about the first amendment when really we just like being condescending . I guess what I 'm saying is that it 's going to be really embarrassing to explain to the youth of the future that in my day , the people demonstrating in the street were called enemies of free speech .

TThis year marks the fifth anniversary of the publication of the Mint Condition : How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession ( Grove/Atlantic Inc , 272 pages , $ 15.95 ) , the definitive history of baseball cards . Dave Jamieson , a contributor to Slate , The New Republic , and The Washington Post , has written a book that is as much fun as opening a pack of baseball cards and discovering a Mickey Mantle and as compelling as a 7th game of the World Series . Make no mistake . Mint Condition is n't a terrific baseball card or baseball book ; it 's a terrific book period . My 88-year-old mother , who , needless to say , does n't know a Clyde Klutz from a Bryce Harper , could n't put it down .
Mint Condition , which still remains in print , was favorably reviewed in all the right places when it first appeared , from The New York Times to The Washington Post . In their 2010 review , a Forbes.com colleague of mine , Steven Schaefer , distilled the essence of its appeal : “ it explores the history of card collecting through an entertaining cast of characters— the visionaries and villains who turned a gimmick designed to boost tobaccos sales into a billion dollar industry . ”
Though Jamieson shows a delightful appreciation for the artistry of “ artifacts of expired popular culture that [ can ] be summoned at any time from a breast pocket , ” they bracket their book at its beginning and end with pessimism about the industry 's future . Their own collection from the 1980s and 1990s , like all the others from that period , is absolutely worthless because it came from overproduced sets that mothers did n't throw away . “ The industry then was driven by unsustainable speculation , and though for a while it yielded a bonanza for manufactures and dealers , the frenzy probably did more harm than good in the long run , ” the author writes .
But five years later , the vintage baseball card industry is booming more than ever , setting all-time records every few months . So what 's going on ? The answer lies in the history Jamieson traces and in the five years since their book came out .
My mother 's favorite visionary in their book is Jefferson Burdick , the father of vintage baseball card collecting . “ Many people credit them with establishing an organized hobby that now includes thousands of collectors , ” Jamieson writes . “ The pioneering research they did in the 1930s has provided the foundation for today 's thriving secondary [ i.e . vintage ] market. ” After contracting a degenerative form rheumatoid arthritis , the Metropolitan Museum of Art agreed to accept their collection of hundreds of thousands of cards on the condition that they curate it . In the early 1960s Burdick , a recluse with no known relatives or friends other than a few fellow collectors with whom they corresponded , brought a small oak desk to the corner of the print department . Living on borrowed time , they “ toiled frantically ” pasting cards into albums . Number 306,353 was their last and they died of an exhausted heart two months later .
The primary villain comes straight from central casting , a hobby kingpin I spent a long day with , helping liquidate a Brooklyn buddy 's baseball card and memorabilia collection about a decade ago . Bill Mastro , brash and obnoxious , was one of the first auctioneers to make big money from baseball cards . They say things like “ I understand why these guys [ his competitors ] do n't like me . It 's not just jealously . I 've extracted my pound of flesh out of them . I handle myself like a business person most of the time , and my job was to take their legs out . I did that in a very surgical manner. ” At the time of their reporting and research , Jamieson notes that allegations were swirling around Mastro that their company was shill bidding , artificially inflating the prices of objects , and that they had trimmed the most valuable Honus Wagner card to improve its condition and value . ( It last sold in 2007 for $ 2.8 million . ) At the National Convention in Cleveland in 2007 Mastro dismissed the charge “ with a wave of their hand ” to the author . Since then they have pled guilty in federal court to the shill bidding and to doctoring the Wagner card , and is awaiting sentencing .
Having reported extensively on the baseball card and memorabilia auction business for many years , my impression is that the Mastro scandal has sent a chill through the industry . At last year 's National Sports Collectors Convention in Cleveland , a dealer joked to me that there should be a betting pool based on which auctioneers would be escorted off the floor in handcuffs . While there are still unscrupulous dealers playing small con games , my impression based on the multitude of shows and auctions I 've covered , is that the systemic fraud is less prevalent because the FBI is watching .
Jamieson rightly condemns the mass-market bubble of new cards in the 1980s and 1990s when speculators bought jillions of cases . Back then I remember one dealer boasting that they cashed out their retirement funds to buy new cards on their road to financial freedom ; I 'm sure they are n't alone . “ The card industry had been headed for an epic crash since the speculative era of collecting had begun , ” Jamieson says . They estimate that more than a million of the Ken Griffey 1989 rookie cards were produced . In hindsight the market was clearly rigged . A lot of collectors returned defective Griffey cards so the manufacturer went back to printing hundreds at a time .
Rather than the primary market fueling the secondary market as it did 25 years ago , the two are now entirely separate . There 's still a sizeable following for shiny new cards with swatches of uniforms and slivers of bats of popular players , but almost all the big-time dealers and auction houses specialize in vintage cards and memorabilia— i.e . bats , jerseys , and autographs— produced before the early 1970s . ( Jamieson wisely skips memorabilia , a whole other realm unto itself . ) The third party , independent grading companies are not perfect by any stretch— the trimmed Wagner card eluded detection— but they they 've devised a fair and accurate way of updating the quantity of graded cards and their values .
Meanwhile collecting borders on a national obsession , fed by eBay and TV programs like Antiques Roadshow , PBS 's most popular and longest running show ; Pawn Stars ; and American Pickers . There are even smaller shows devoted to sports cards and memorabilia . “ Fully one third of North Americans define themselves as ‘ collectors , ' wrote Maureen Stanton in Killer Stuff and Tons of Money : Seeking History and Hidden Gems in Flea-Market Americain 2011 . “ In one study , over 60 percent of American households reported having at least one collection. ” One antiques authority says that before eBay there were 1,500 categories of collectibles . Since then , there are now more than 30,000 , and that number is still is increasing .
As for the baseball card collecting craze , Jamieson quotes a Burdick contemporary : “ I would like to have an example of every card ever issued . It 's a form of megalomania , of course . But not , I think , a bad form. ” What says megalomania more than appearing on a reality TV show with a rare 1870s baseball card or registering your valuable baseball card set on website for the whole world to see ?
Besides their competitive streaks , many of the top baseball card and memorabilia collectors talk about the strong pull of their childhoods . Michael Eisner compares their rationale for buying Topps , the number one baseball card company , to the “ Proustian kind of uplift ” associated with Disney , the company they ran successfully for many years . For many young grown men baseball cards are a more tangible and valuable asset to conjure up their childhoods than video games . Or as Woody Gellman , a visionary card designer for Topps , told Jamieson , “ Part of it is a recapturing . You discovered how to play . You go back with a vengeance . ”
With today 's popular culture so transitory , baseball cards offer permanence , even intimations of immortality . “ I still say the trick is to retire early enough , ” Burdick wrote . “ As time goes on , I see ever so many waiting until they literally have one foot in the grave before they quit . Then the retirement period is too short , as it will probably be for me . Nobody can figure accurately how many years are left for them. ” Many of today 's collectors see their profiting from the past as a way of preserving it .
I 'm not sure this age of disruptive technology we inhabit is any more stressful than earlier eras , but baseball card collecting still offers a fun escape . As an early collector of vintage baseball cards in my early teens , I remember a wonderful quote of Burdick 's that does n't appear in Mint Condition , but is echoed by Jamieson 's other sources . “ A card collection is a magic carpet that takes you away from work-a-day cards to havens of relaxing quietude where you can relive the pleasures and adventures of a past day— brought to life in vivid pictures and prose. ” This fantastic notion of collecting as a magic carpet has stuck with me ever since .
Granted , baseball cards are big business like the game itself and have been sold to both adults and grown-ups with cigarettes that cause lung cancer , chewing tobacco that causes mouth cancer , or gum that rots teeth . Furthermore companies have been guilty of scams like not printing an individual card in a 1933 set to induce children to go on shopping sprees in futile efforts to complete sets .
A reader of my Forbes posts commented that the high-end of the industry reminded them of Robin Williams ' line that “ cocaine is God 's way of reminding the rich they have too much money. ” A key figure at a top auction house told me that they doubted the prices for baseball cards and memorabilia , such as the record $ 4.4 million for a Babe Ruth jersey , would ever have been so high , relatively speaking , in the 1950s or 1960s . They were alluding to the income tax rate that now favors the top one percent . If polls are any indication , I regret conceding that our tax rate wo n't be more progressive again anytime soon . In a story about the recent auction of a $ 179.4 million Picasso painting , a record price for art , The New York Times Neil Irwin writes “ The astronomical rise in prices for the most-sought-after works of art over the last generation is in large part the story of rising global inequality . The number of people with the will and the resources to buy top-end art is rising , thanks to the distribution of extreme wealth. ” The billionaires they have in mind are the beyond the one percenters ; they are the the 0.1 percent or even the 0.01 percent .
At the same time my thinking about the dealers and collectors I 've befriended since starting my Forbes blog almost two years ago has evolved . At show after show , I see middle class and working class types of the kind that attend such events spending thousands and even tens of thousands of their hard-earned dollars on baseball cards . They may not be in the league of the one-percenters , but they can be the masters of their own universes for an afternoon . What worries me about their conspicuous and sometimes contagious consumption is stories they tell me about putting their investment-grade cards in bank safety deposit boxes as though they are U.S. Savings Bonds . “ Buying baseball cards is a lot like gambling , ” a well-heeled collector tells Jamieson . “ If one is n't willing to lose money altogether , then they should n't buy the cards. ” In other posts I 've preached the wisdom of spending only your discretionary income , not your grocery money , on sports collectibles and buying what you like in case it drops in value .
I do have other worries . Affluent collectors could cause a crash by pulling out of the top end . And I agree with Jamieson that the lack of children or even teenagers at shows does n't bode well for the industry 's future . My efforts taking the 16 and 18-year-old sons of my friends to the big shows in White Plains , New York failed to transform them into my collecting soul-mates . “ Mostly notably missing from the National [ Convention ] were children , ” Jamieson writes . “ At nearly 30 years old I felt like a spry pup alongside the vast majority of collectors there , most of them appearing to have settled nicely into middle age. ” By the same token I 've gotten to be friends with a few card dealers in their mid-20s like Jonathan Celona and Greg Campbell . I also see a lot of families lining up to meet their heroes like Mariano Rivera at autograph shows where baseball card dealers set up . The problem is that after shelling out $ 300 for Mo 's signature and $ 100 for each inscription they have a lot less to spend on cards .
Even though people primarily collect their memories , very few of today 's buyers of Jackie Robinson and Satchel Paige bubblegum cards are old enough to have ever seen them play , much like Burdick only knew Cap Anson and Buck Ewing from their 1880s tobacco cards . Since 1930 vintage baseball card collecting has survived the Great Depression and least a half dozen recessions . “ Burdick knew the story behind the Wagner and had apparently struggled to obtain one himself , ” Jamieson writes “ Even as they tried to keep prices down , they acknowledged the Wagner 's scarcity and value , pricing it in their 1960 catalog at a whopping $ 50— the highest of any card— compared to T206s. ” That 's $ 400 , adjusted for inflation . When I was a child in the early 1970s the price was $ 1500 , or $ 8500 in today 's money . A few weeks ago , Robert Edward Auctions , a top auction house Jamieson covers in Mint Condition , sold a Wagner card in very good condition for more than $ 1.3 million . Long live baseball cards .
Lance Armstrong has n't told “ the whole story ” yet . Ever since their long-awaited January confession with Oprah Winfrey , the high priestess of American talk shows , the now former seven-time winner of the Tour de France has n't uttered a word , just a rare tweet from time to time to their four million followers on Twitter .
So when we proposed to them three months ago to “ tell their tale ” in the pages of this newspaper , they –- in their own words -- first thought about telling us to “ f * # k off. ” That was before they realized that it was in fact “ a damn great idea . ”
The plan was for them to tell their story , including the Tour and the drugs , in a daily column during the three weeks of the landmark 100th edition of the French race , set to begin on Saturday . But in the meantime , Armstrong had to sell their beautiful house in Austin to pay their lawyers . And it was those same lawyers who finally convinced their client that such a `` tell-all '' operation was too dangerous in light of the ongoing Justice Department investigations on the heels of the damning report released by the USADA , the United States Anti-Doping Agency .
Always on the move between Austin , Hawaii and Colorado , it was impossible to set a face-to-face meeting . Lance Armstrong did not tell the whole story , once again . Still this interview is another big step on the road that leads to the truth .
LE MONDE : Do you keep riding your bicycle despite all the trouble the sport has put you in ?
LANCE ARMSTRONG : Absolutely I keep on cycling and training . Riding a bike has always been a therapy for me . What was true when I was training for the Tour remains true to this day . A good ol ' three or four-hour rides will clear your head like nothing else .
Every other living winner should be there ( The 100th edition of the Tour de France ) for the occasion . Would you have liked to be a part of it ?
No . Even if I was invited , I would have chosen to just stay home with my family .
What does the Tour de France mean to you now ?
The Tour is a great event . It 's hard , long and intense . I still love it and all it represents .
Do you believe you still hold the record of victories ?
Absolutely .
Did you keep your seven yellow shirts ( token of the Tour leader ) or did you burn them ?
Ha ha ! No way . I worked hard for those shirts and I love them for what they are and the memories they hold .
Do you understand the Tour managers and the International Cycling Union 's ( UCI ) decision to delete your name from the winners list ?
Yes and no . It 's fine to erase my name from the winners lists , but the Tour did take place from 1999 to 2005 , so there has to be a winner . Who is it then ? I will let other people debate who was the true winner of those Tours . But so far no one has stood up and claimed my yellow jerseys ...
In its report , the USADA accuses you of using “ the most sophisticated , professional and effective doping program in the history of sports… ”
The USADA report is complete bullshit . We saw that the Puerto system was a hundred times more sophisticated . Our system was very simple , very conservative , not evil at all like they said . History will show that this was just a 'talking point ' for USADA . By the way , what other teams did the USADA investigate ? If there are n't any , then how can they know our system was the most sophisticated ? It does n't make any sense .
UCI president Pat McQuaid not only took away your seven titles and suspended you for life , they also asked for you never to have anything to do with cycling ...
Pat McQuaid can say and think what they want , and pretend to be tough on doping . He 's got no credibility on this . The sport needs new leadership to try and regain credibility . It simply ca n't move on with McQuaid as the leader .
During your January television interview , you hinted at the possibility of a collaboration with a sort of “ truth and reconciliation ” commission . The USADA and the World Anti-Doping Association ( WADA ) had proposed to the UCI that such a commission should be put together . The federation rejected this offer . Why do you think they did so ?
UCI is refusing to move on a 'Truth and Reconciliation ' commission because the testimony the world would hear would sink McQuaid , ( former UCI president Hein ) Verbruggen , and the UCI .
Why are you ready to talk in front of a `` truth and reconciliation '' commission and what do you want to say ?
The 'reasoned decision ' was not an accurate depiction of cycling from the late 1980 's until today . It worked perfectly to destroy one man 's life but it has not benefitted cycling .
One of the questions this commission could ask you is : When you were racing , was it possible to accomplish such performances without drugs ?
It depends on the races you want to win . It is impossible to win the Tour de France without doping . Because the Tour is an event where oxygen is too important . Just a quick example : EPO is no use to win a 100-meter dash , but it would help the 10-K runner . Obviously .
How did you make the choice to use performance-enhancing substances ?
Human nature…
Could you tell us about your personal experience ?
No .
How can we put an end to the scourge of drugs in cycling ?
It will never stop for many reasons . I did not invent doping , sorry Travis [ Tygart , head of USADA ] ; nor did I end it . I merely participated in it . I am a human being . Doping exists since ancient times , and it will probably continue to exist . I know this is n't a very popular response , but it 's the sad truth .
Do you understand that your former sponsor US Postal joined Floyd Landis and the Justice Department in suing you for 100 million dollars ?
No comment .
Are you scared about going to jail ?
No .
Are you scared of ending up broke ?
No .
Were you ever scared of testing positive , and it 's destroying your career ?
I have never been afraid of anti-doping controls . Our system was pretty basic and risk averse . I was much more afraid of the Douane [ French customs ] or the police .
Pat McQuaid swore under oath to the Senate Inquiry Commission that the UCI never covered you . In fact , back in 1999 during your first victory on the Tour , “ Le Monde ” had revealed that you tested positive to corticoids and the UCI had accepted a back-dated certificate to protect you . Is that correct ?
I do n't know what Pat McQuaid said under oath but it 's true that the UCI had accepted a back-dated certificate in 1999 .
You paid $ 100,000 to the UCI in 2002 . Do you believe it 's normal for an international institution to accept money from one of its champions ?
That 's not true . I gave that money after I retired in 2005 . It 's easy to say today that this was inacceptable behavior . That was eight years ago . Times have changed . I guess nowadays , that would be considered intolerable . I keep wondering why we 're still arguing over what happened so many years ago . It 's absurd in so many ways .
Do you feel remorse today ?
I will never be able to repair this , but I will spend my life trying . I was too hard on people . I was too much of a 'fighter ' . Fighting on the bike is perfect . Fighting off it is not . I could n't , and did n't , separate the two .
Where do you stand on the Puerto case , in which the judge ordered the blood bags to be destroyed , nullifying the chances to identify Dr. Fuentes ' other non-cyclist clients ?
I 'm sure some big soccer clubs had some influence during the Puerto trial . In any case , it 's yet again cycling that has taken the brunt of the blame .
Did you send Nicolas Sarkozy a message after their defeat in the presidential elections ?
No , but I really like 'Sarko ' as a man . Not making a political statement , just a personal one . They were always cool with me .
Sarkozy wants to come back for the presidential elections of 2017 , why did you return in 2009 ?
Good question . This was the biggest mistake I ever made . I would do anything to change the past , but what 's done is done . I should have listened to Jean-Marie Leblanc when they wrote me an open letter during the Fall of 2008 advising me not to come back . They were right .
J.J Abrams , the creator of the “ Lost ” series announced that they were working on a movie about you . Are you worried or amazed ?
Neither . They have n't called me .
What is Lance Armstrong 's lifestyle today ?
My typical day ? I wake up , drink my coffee , read the paper ( The New York Times ) , Have my breakfast , I go out for a spin , a run…I practice . I come back , have lunch with my kids then I spend the rest of my day in meetings , golfing or at the playground with my kids . Around 5 p.m , I open a nice , cold beer and I think .

US official Victoria Nuland was recorded saying `` Fuck the EU '' while discussing the crisis in Ukraine with the US ambassador to the country .
A recording of the tapped telephone conversation was posted online .
It comes as the EU and US are in talks to end months of unrest in Ukraine between the opposition , who want the country to become closer to the West , and the government who turned down a deal with the EU late last year under Russian pressure .
`` The chancellor considers this statement absolutely unacceptable ... and wants to emphasize again that [ EU foreign policy chief Catherine ] Ashton is doing an outstanding job , '' Merkel 's spokesperson said . `` The European Union will continue with its intensive efforts to calm the situation in Ukraine . ''
In the recording Nuland and US ambassador to Kiev , Geoff Pyatt , discuss frankly which opposition figures should go into the new Ukrainian government .
`` That would be great I think to help glue this thing and have the UN glue it and you know , fuck the EU , '' Nuland says , in apparent frustration at policy differences .
The clip went viral after somehow being intercepted and uploaded onto YouTube accompanied by Russian captions .
The US State Department was left fuming after the leak , pointing the finger at Russia for allegedly bugging the diplomats ' phones .
Merkel 's spokesperson Christiane Wirtz , asked whether a US apology had been received , told the Berlin press conference that `` contact was made with the chancellery '' , without providing further details .
A German foreign ministry spokesperson touched on the suspicion that Russia was behind the leak to take a swipe at the United States for its own sweeping surveillance , including of Merkel 's mobile phone . `` This shows you that eavesdropping is stupid , '' they said .
Washington 's new top diplomat for Europe apologized on Thursday for their comments .
EXPLETIVE WARNING : Listen to the telephone conversation below .
The German press has played down Nuland 's use of the expletive to describe the EU .
Online news site Speigel ran an opinion piece headed “ Calm down , Europe ” .
In it , the author puts forward the argument that the word “ fuck ” is thrown around freely in the US , especially in high-pressure situations .
“ Europe needs to just laugh about the American F-word . A bit of humour would n't go amiss in transatlantic relations , '' it said .
The author posed the question whether Europe 's anger was fair . “ Yes and no ” was the answer .
It was , the author said , justifiable when taking into consideration the unrest engulfing Kiev and Ukraine currently .
British Muslim scholars have made a direct video appeal to Islamist militants to release Alan Henning , whom they are threatening to behead , warning the killing would break Islamic laws .
The video appeals come from three scholars from the orthodox Salafi school of Islamic thought , which many in the west see as fundamentalist .
Their plea on behalf of Henning comes as friends and colleagues of a second British hostage , the photojournalist John Cantlie , spoke of their dismay at the propaganda video they were forced to make , which was distributed through social media on Thursday .
After watching the video , in which Cantlie exhorted members of the public to call on the UK and US governments to negotiate with their captors , they spoke of a man who is resourceful and charming , but whose bravery would frequently border on the reckless .
The video in which Cantlie appears marks an unexpected departure for Isis . The group 's previous three videos have depicted hostages being murdered .
Cantlie , 43 , speaks directly to the camera from behind a desk , reading calmly from a script that presents them as a journalist who will be making a series of films that will `` show you the truth '' about Isis and western military action in the region .
One colleague , who did not wish to be named , said they suspected that Cantlie may have suggested to their captors that they should make the films : `` No doubt he 's doing whatever they can to save himself . ''
The Muslim scholars who are appealing for the release of Henning say that their detention is against the Qur'an 's teachings and an injustice on a scale suffered by Muslims who have been held at Guantánamo by the US , and those held by Britain without trial .

Two of the scholars in the video seen by the Guardian have been accused of sympathising with extremism , which they deny . They describe Henning as a humanitarian who travelled to Syria to help to suffer Muslims . They hope their political credibility and theological learning will sway Isis .
They are hoping the videos reach Islamic State captors through social media , which the militants have proven so skilled at using themselves .
Henning , 47 , who is married with two teenage children , is a taxi driver from Eccles , Greater Manchester . They fell into the hands of Isis after joining their Muslim friends on an aid convoy to Syria last Christmas . They were seized shortly after the group crossed the Turkish border .
Last weekend they appeared at the end of a video depicting the murder of Scottish aid worker David Haines , with killer threatening that Henning will be the next to die .
Imam Shakeel Begg , of the Lewisham Islamic Centre in south London , addresses the Islamic State captors as `` our brothers and sisters in Islam '' in their address , which quotes from the Qur'an to provide a theological justification for Henning being released unharmed .
The Lewisham Islamic Centre was allegedly frequented by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale , the killers of the British soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich .
The Senate is moving to suspend senators Mike Duffy and Pamela Wallin from the red chamber without pay , CBC has learned .
At the same time , Duffy has sent a letter to the Speaker of the Senate , Noel Kinsella , requesting a medical leave of absence because of a heart condition .
Three motions were read in the Senate shortly after 2:40 p.m . ET that would strip Wallin and Duffy of not only their pay , but also Senate resources and benefits . One of the motions would also reinstate a suspension of Senator Patrick Brazeau , but also dock their pay and benefits , as well as the use of their office .
Duffy and Wallin have both repaid money to the Senate after questions about their expense claims . Duffy repaid more than $ 90,000 in March with a personal cheque from Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's former chief of staff . Wallin complied with a Senate order to repay more than $ 140,000 , including interest , in September .
Both senators were subjects of damning forensic reports from the accounting firm Deloitte about inappropriate spending . Duffy is now being investigated by the RCMP over their Senate expense claims .
A Conservative notice of motion to suspend Wallin and Duffy came from government Senate leader Claude Carignan in the Senate 's first meeting since the House was prorogued last June .
In the motion related to Wallin , Carignan stated , `` The Senate orders a suspension for the Honourable Senator Wallin for sufficient cause , considering their gross negligence in the management of their parliamentary resources until such time as this order is rescinded . ''
The motion , under Senate rules , ca n't be debated for at least 48 hours . A debate will take place at the Senate 's next session on Tuesday .
After a debate , the motion will be put to a vote that requires a simple majority to pass . The Conservatives have a majority in the Senate .
Senators can make their case
Carignan , speaking to reporters in the Senate foyer , said the three senators will have a chance to defend themselves when the motion is debated . Duffy , they said , `` will have the opportunity to move amendments . They can make their case Tuesday . ''
Asked if the behaviour of the three senators reflected badly on the judgment of Prime Minister Stephen Harper , since they were their appointees , Carignan said , `` This is n't [ about ] a Liberal , a Conservative or an Independent . This is about a senator who did n't respect the dignity and rules of the Senate . ''
The suspensions , Carignan said , would last until the end of the session , a period of two years until the next general election will be called .
The Liberal leader of the Senate , James Cowan , told reporters they were surprised the Senate 's Conservative-dominated internal economy committee did n't sanction the senators as soon as it found they had inappropriately claimed expense money . `` I do n't think it 's enough to simply pay the money back , '' they said .
They said their Senate caucus members will discuss how they will vote on the motion when they meet on Tuesday morning . Although they said they have n't yet formed a final opinion , Cowan said , `` these were not simple mistakes… there was a pattern of abuse , '' regarding how Duffy , Wallin and Brazeau filled out their expense forms .
Cowan defended the right of the Senate to impose disciplinary sanctions , although none of the three senators has been charged with any offences relating to expenses .
Opposition NDP Leader Tom Mulcair told reporters after question period , `` What do you call three senators suspended without pay ? A good start . We 'd suspend all of them without pay . '' The NDP 's position , a central pillar in its strategy this session , is to abolish the Senate .
Several Liberal senators expressed reservations about what they said was the lack of due process and fairness in the treatment of the three senators . `` They [ the Conservatives ] are doing it for the polls , '' said Liberal Senator George Baker .
Conservative Senator Hugh Segal , an old friend of Wallin 's , issued a statement saying they could not support the motion . `` The motion in Senator Wallin 's case seems both ill-informed , inconsistent with the many problems in the report of the board of internal economy which itself has never been discussed in any way in the Senate . ''
Brazeau 's suspension would be toughened
Brazeau , who is also under investigation by the RCMP for their expense accounts , was suspended earlier this year by the Senate after they were charged for sexual assault in a separate matter . Days after their charge , the Senate voted unanimously to suspend them with pay , in a motion that stated in order to `` protect the dignity and reputation of the Senate and public trust and confidence in Parliament , the Senate order a leave of absence . ''
The motion on Thursday that would reinstate their suspension is a tougher one , removing their pay , benefits and use of any Senate resources including travel funds and telecommunications .
It 's not known if Brazeau has asked the Senate for a medical leave . However , some of the court dates in their sexual assault charge have been moved because of the state of their health . A few weeks ago , after police were called to a house in Gatineau , Que. , Brazeau was taken to a local hospital .
Senate sources say Duffy 's request for a medical leave will not override a move to suspend him , because a suspension would be a `` disciplinary sanction for an unrelated matter . ''
In the letter about their state of health , Duffy wrote , `` When I had open-heart surgery in 2006 , they found three blockages . Because of bleeding , broken ribs and various complications , they ended up fixing the main problem , but did not want to keep me on the table longer to fix the other two blocked vessels . They suggested that surgery could come later . ''
Over the summer , Duffy said , they suffered unstable angina and ended up in hospital in Halifax for two days . They said their doctor recommended they stay off work `` until I get the all-clear from my medical team . ''

Freedom Rider : Killing Kaepernick 's Movement
“ We must say with a loud voice that we join with Colin Kaepernick in the fight against police brutality . ”
“ A system that perpetually condones the killing of people , without consequence , does n't need to be revised , it needs to be dismantled ! ” -- Colin Kaepernick
NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick was clear from the outset . Beginning in the 2016 pre-season they declared that they would not stand during the playing of the national anthem . They would instead “ take a knee ” and they did so to protest the police killing of over 300 black people every year . In the summer of 2016 Alton Sterling was murdered one day and Philando Castille the next . Both killings took place on camera and Kaepernick began to speak up . They did n't shrink and did n't hesitate in denouncing the everyday carnage in this country . `` I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color . To me , this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way . There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder . ''
Kaepernick 's motives were always clear , but they have now been muddled by the usual suspects of spineless liberalism and opportunistic , traitorous black people . The history of the struggle for liberation is littered with examples of cooptation and ruin at the hands of the fearful and the deceitful .
“ Kaepernick did n't shrink and did n't hesitate in denouncing the everyday carnage in this country . ”
Donald Trump 's foray into the Kaepernick story sealed the deal for erasure . By calling any player who refused to stand for the anthem a “ son of a bitch ” they ensured controversy but over the wrong issue . Kaepernick 's stance was not about patriotism , the flag , or whether or not white people approved of their actions .
What should be a call to action for a new movement has instead brought many dubious characters out of the woodwork and onto the bandwagon . Trump is a lightning rod for outrage but not necessarily because their critics are serious about fighting racism .
Some of those who waded into the Trump storm have no interest in fighting police brutality . They had already taken a knee of silence to avoid being attacked by racist white people . Basketball star Lebron James belongs in that category .
“ Kaepernick 's stance was not about patriotism , the flag , or whether or not white people approved of their actions . ”
James called Trump a “ bum ” on social media and received undeserved applause . Name calling directed at a reviled man is n't very brave but that is the limit of the superstar 's political courage . James said nothing about Tamir Rice , an eleven-year old shot dead by Cleveland police . Rice 's grieving mother spoke for millions of people when they pleaded for James to say something about their child who was killed in the city where James makes a fortune . “ I 'm not asking anybody to quit their job or anything , but make a statement for us black people out here. ” We can only hope that they did n't hold their breath . Now the man who could only mumble “ I do n't have enough knowledge about it , ” is receiving kudos for their mild invective against a man whose overt racism renders protest moot .
Trump 's intrusion has given legitimacy to cooptation and the dilution of Kaepernick 's powerful message . The media chime in and make note of every white person who claims to support their efforts without asking where they stand on the issue of state sanctioned murder . We are now told to be happy that a particular white person , or a veteran , or an old white veteran is taking a knee . The same people who patted themselves on the back for taking down Confederate monuments or wearing pink pussy hats now boast that they “ stand with Kap . ”
“ Lebron James said nothing about Tamir Rice , an eleven-year old shot dead by Cleveland police . ”
Even NFL team owners who threatened to fire protesting players are now kneeling , locking arms and singing kumbaya . The drama is proof that just a handful of people were ever serious about waging a fight against police murder . The Johnny-come-latelies and two-faced racists have sealed the deal and robbed Kaepernick 's protest of any power .
Black people are always standing alone , just like Kaepernick . We may plan a poor people 's march on Washington but then allow radical movement building to turn into an extravaganza approved by the Kennedy administration . The pressure to water down our demands is always very real .
We must say with a loud voice that we join with Colin Kaepernick in the fight against police brutality . We must reclaim their righteous anger and tell anyone who wants to promote peace or love or patriotism or team spirit that their mealy mouthed intentions are not welcome .
Kaepernick made police brutality their target . No one should claim to join with them unless they are completely onboard with that sentiment . Stand or kneel with Kaepernick against the police state or do n't bother at all .

A Vanguard High School senior was arrested Thursday and charged with Armed Robbery .
Clarence Sylvester Cobarris , 18 , was arrested by an Ocala Police Department detective , at 605 Northeast 27th Street , Ocala , at 1:41 a.m .
Police say they responded to the Kangaroo Gas Station , located at 909 Northeast 28th Street , after a store clerk called 911 and reported the robbery .
The store clerk told police that a black man wearing a black and gray hooded sweatshirt and an orange mask entered the store with a silver handgun and backpack .
The clerk said the man placed the backpack on the counter , pointed the gun at her , and told them to “ put the money in the bag ” . The clerk put $ 35.99 in the bag , along with a GPS tracking device .
Cobarris then fled the store .
Investigators tracked the GPS to the area of Northeast 27th Street and Northeast 6th Avenue . There , an OPD officer saw Cobarris standing near a garbage can on the north side of the road .
Cobarris saw the officer and attempted to walk toward an occupied vehicle , which was waiting with the passenger door open .
The officer then moved in on the four suspects and ordered them all on the ground .
During a “ pat-down ” , Cobarris was found to be in possession of the handgun used during the robbery . Additionally , Cobarris was in possession of the GPS device and some of the money that had been stolen .
Detectives said they also found clothing in the trash can where Cobarris had been standing . The clothing matched the description of the clothing warn by the robbery suspect .
At first , Cobarris told investigators that they were walking from home when they found the money on the side of the road . They denied knowing anything about the robbery , but said they knew of three juveniles who were planning to rob the store . However , Cobarris gave themselves away when they inadvertently described the clothing the robber was wearing .
According to OPD , Cobarris later told them that they needed the money for their graduation cap and gown .
Cobarris is being held at the Marion County Jail on a $ 50,000 bond .
March 2010 : “ Greece has a role model , and that model is Ireland ” — Jean-Claude Trichet

Feel the boom !
OK , maybe a bit more exegesis : Ireland embraced austerity early and forcefully , and has been a good soldier all along ; so according to the austerians , it should be a success story . And they keep on seizing on any bit of good news as proof that austerity is working .
Now , sooner or later Ireland will recover . But guys , we 're already four years into this story …

Congratulations , you have successfully mind-f * * * ed your potential audience into cautious optimism .
Sorry , but there 's a wide chasm between `` not as bad '' and `` actually good '' . Everything I 've heard and seen about this show so far makes me want to bang my head on my desk ( although , on second thought , brain damage might not be such a bad thing here ) .
Sorry for the pessimism , but as a massive Wonder Woman fan , I can only pray to the gods that this project crashes and burns at the pilot stage . Between Kelley 's `` vision '' , the casting and the costume ... damn ... It 's been a rough year for WW , please do n't add a mediocre , Bionic Woman-style TV show to it .
Nearly 30 percent more people worldwide died from being obese in 2015 than in 1990 , according to a new study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine . A quarter-century ago , about 50 deaths out of every 100,000 were related to being overweight . As of 2015 , the number is now 54 out of every 100,000 .
Researchers analyzed the health data of over 68 million people in 195 countries . First , the team estimated how common being overweight or obese was among both children and adults from 1980 to 2015 . Next , they analyzed the cost and health impacts related to high BMI from 1990 to 2015 . This means taking into account both deaths and disability-adjusted life-years , or the number of years that you lost or lived with disability due directly to a high BMI .
Since 1980 , obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries . In 2015 , 5 percent of children overall were obese , and 12 percent of adults . Peak obesity rates were in older adults over 50 , and women were more likely to be obese than men in every age bracket . Also as of 2015 , there are about 108 million obese children and 604 million obese adults worldwide . There are fewer obese children than adults , but children are getting obese faster , with the rate of obesity growing especially quickly among children in countries like China and Brazil .
The results show that obesity caused four million deaths in 2015 alone , most of these due to cardiovascular disease . ( This represents 7.1 percent of the deaths from any cause . ) Cardiovascular disease related to high BMI was the leading cause , with chronic kidney disease being the second .
All this said , even though the overall rate of death is increasing , there is n't a very significant change when you adjust for the age and population . In other words , even though there are more people dying overall from being obese , obese people are healthier and living for longer years than in the past because of better medical care . But in this case , living longer means more years living with obesity and associated diseases , like diabetes . For instance , in 2015 , high BMI led to people worldwide living a total of 28.6 million years with a form of disability .
Overall , the authors conclude that obesity remains a growing public health problem , and one that we need to continue keeping track of and fighting .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The European Union on Tuesday extended until April 2018 sanctions against Iran for “ serious human rights violations ” , a narrower measure than restrictions the bloc had already lifted after an international accord on Tehran 's nuclear programme .
The EU has pursued rapprochement with Iran since the 2015 nuclear deal , which reversed a decade of hard-hitting Western financial and trade sanctions against the Islamic Republic . Top EU officials have been shuttling in and out of Tehran since , often accompanied by large European business delegations .
But the bloc has also extended by a year its travel ban and an asset freeze on 82 Iranian people and one entity , as well as a ban on exports to Iran of equipment for monitoring telecommunications and other gear that “ might be used for internal repression . ”
The EU 's efforts to re-engage with Iran have grown more complicated since Donald Trump became the new U.S. president and took a harder line on the country than their predecessor Barack Obama .
Did you know that the EU has its own riot police that can operate in any European country but is answerable directly to none of them ? No I did n't either .
They are called the European Gendarmerie Force ( Eurogendfor ) . They are based in Italy but funded and staffed by six signatory nations who are France , Italy , Holland , Spain , Portugal and Romania . However , according to the Treaty which established Eurogendfor they can operate in any EU country and are available to others who invite them to do so . The country which invites them in is refered to as the ‘ Host ' .
The Gendarmerie is specifically set up to deal with riots and civil unrest and as the treaty spells out they are to be
…exclusively comprising elements of police forces with military status
Here is a picture of the force . How many police forces or even riot police do you know who drill with bayonet ?
The force is 3000 strong based in Italy composed of two rapid deployment brigades . Since Greece is not a member of Eurogendfor few if any of its troops/officers ( ? ) will speak Greek . Yet they may now be operating in Greece . I have checked with friends in Athens and they tell me it is true .
I have also contacted – or tried to contact – Eurogendfor directly to double-check the facts . However the email contact on their web site does not work . You can fill out the form but for the last 4 and a half hours when I press send I get this reply ,
“ Server is unable to send your request.Please try later ” .
Should you phone the HQ directly , you will find an automated system . There is a Press Office option but it cycles you back to the main ‘ Welcome ” menu as does EVERY single other option as well . This has been how it is all day .
Thus is is n't how it is over lunch this is just how it has been set up . In other words there is the facade of contact but the operational reality is “ Piss Off you commoner ! ”
What does it say if it turns out ot be true that the Greek government has ‘ invited ' a quasi military riot police made of personel from other nations to operate in Greece against its own citizens . Greek police not enough ? Greek military not willing to crack heads ? Got to get some foreigners to do it for you ?
What exactly is the difference between Eurogendfor and any other mercenary force ? The Greek government could ‘ invite ' any private army in . No matter how you view the status of Eurogendfor , the reality is the Greek people did not vote in favour of joining it and certainly were not asked if they wanted foreign quasi military forces to be able to operate in Greece . If this story turns out to be true then it iouwld mean that the greek government that like all governments through history that have lost all legitimacy with its own people , eventually seek military support from outside forces with which to supress its own people . Once you view it like that the word tyranny eventually enters in . And that word has extremely serious consequences .
Let 's take a step back from this . The cuts in Greece are tied up intimately with bailing out French and German banks as well as the Greek owners of Greek banks . The Greek people have been demonstrating against the bail out for months . The Greek government has ignored its people and chosen to do the bidding of the EU elite , the IMF , the ECB and most of all the banks globally .
Now it is alleged that a non-Greek militarized riot force may have arrived to enforce austerity . Whose bidding would they really be doing ? Whose interests would they be serving ? Could it be the banks ? Have the financial class now got their own riot police who they can ship to wherever the locals try to defy them and where the local police can not be ‘ trusted ' to serve the supra-national interests of the banks ?
Of course this is not how Eurogendfor is set up . I know that . But is this how it actually works nevertheless ?
I will continue to try to talk to anyone at all at Eurogendfor and let you know if they ever condescend to even accept an email or answer the phone . Do n't hold your breath . Who am I after all ? Just a citizen and what does that count for these days ?
Citizen ? In the new order you 're either a bondholder or you 're a nobody .
Review If a picture tells 1,000 words , then an interactive bubble chart indexed by year based on a data model with a hierarchy of sub-categories ought to speak volumes .
Microsoft 's business intelligence product Power BI is the latest addition to Office 365 , its online office suite designed to integrate with desktop versions of Office .
Power BI was released last summer in preview mode , and earlier this year Microsoft made it fully available as part of Office 365 .
It is an attempt to marry advanced spreadsheet reporting features with back-end collaborative features based on SharePoint .
So how well did Redmond execute ?
This is n't a packaged product . Instead Power BI is a collection of features bundled together under a single heading and aiming to enable members of an organisation to share reports with each other .
Explore the world
Some of those features are additions to Excel that beef up its business intelligence capabilities , moving beyond the simple charting and pivot table functions we have seen in previous versions .
Power Query is the starting point for these tools and we had to download that as a separate add-in for the spreadsheet program .
One of the best features of Power Query is its ability to pull in data sets from online sources . You can import data sets from databases and files , using the “ Get External Data ” section of the Power Query menu .
You can also enter a web URL directly , or even search for data sets online . This seems to scrape data from different places , even Wikipedia tables .
You can search for publicly available data online and load it as a query using Power Query . Most of it seems to come from Wikipedia pages .
Importing this data makes it available as queries inside Excel , which can then be manipulated . Queries can be merged with each other , for example , and shaped to remove specific columns . Even merges can be merged to create aggregated data sets from multiple , relatively simple sources .
Once this data has been massaged effectively , it can be folded into a data mode using Power Pivot , which can then be manipulated further , creating relationships and data hierarchies . When that is complete , you can visualise the data using the Power View function , which is also installed when you update Excel with Power Query .
This is a way to produce interactive charts that you can share with others using the collaborative server-side functionality in Power BI .
The Power View , which you access via the Insert menu , starts with a view of the fields in your data model . You drag the fields that you want to visualise onto the main Power View sheet and it creates a table .
You can then access different chart types from the Design menu ribbon . Excel shows you different chart types , based on the data in your table .
You can drag fields from your data model into Power View , to create a table…
... which can then be turned into charts far more sophisticated than our effort . Did we mention that we are better with prose ?
Tiling is an important part of this interactivity , and it is pretty powerful . When you want to show complex data sets ( for example , population and pollution data over a certain period ) , referenced by a particular field ( say , US state ) , you can select that reference field to tile by .
This creates a sequence of US states , each of them clickable and each bringing up a tile displaying the data for that state in chart form . It is a good way to present a lot of data in a small space .
Power Maps is the other item in the Excel toolbox . Selecting “ Map ” when visualising that Power View data presents a set of field options , including a location field . You can drag a field containing one of several location types , including cities , counties and countries , and it will parse them automatically , superimposing them onto an interactive Bing map .
This map shows carbon emissions by US state , cribbed from Wikipedia . The mapping function is automatic .
These interactive reports are all very well but they are not much use without the ability to share them . This is where Power BI comes in . The system uses SharePoint for users to collaborate and view reports and workbooks .
Installing Power BI is not necessarily an easy process . Before you can take advantage of the software , you must have an organisational account so that an administrator can add a member of that organisation as a Power BI user .
Grown-up version
It is not something you will be able to set up on your student Office 365 subscription , and neither would you want to . This is an enterprise product for creating collaborative business intelligence reports .
Typically , an organisational user will have an Office 365 E3 licence or some such to use the professional software products underpinning Power BI . The site takes a few minutes to provision the service once you have added it into your administrative account .
The administrator must then add Power BI users , either individually or en masse , via Azure Active Directory integration or by uploading a CSV file .
The Power BI administrator can set up data sources locally on the company 's premises by installing a data gateway . This can then be used to serve up organisational data via OData , Microsoft 's open-data protocol that the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards finally standardised in March .
Power BI installation automatically creates a Power BI site on SharePoint . Once users have produced a report from their data model , they upload it manually to the Power BI site . This creates a thumbnail of the last sheet used in the spreadsheet , which is typically the data visualisation .
These interactive reports are then usable by others , and they are analysed by Power BI within SharePoint so that you can search for them by asking natural language questions .
You can upload your nice new report and tag it as featured so that everyone can see your handiwork .
The other elements – the data queries – are more easily shareable . They can be uploaded directly from within Excel and you can then see who is using them .
Power BI is a combination of server-side and client-side functionality , and it is powerful as far as it goes . Its biggest drawback is Microsoft 's walled-garden approach . There is limited opportunity for sharing these gorgeous reports with users outside an organisation .
For your eyes only
You can do it , but without the support for larger , 250Mb workbooks that comes with Power BI ( Excel for Office 365 normally supports only 10Mb worksheets ) .
And the Windows 8 app that Microsoft provides as a viewer for Power BI docs wo n't play well with external users . Microsoft says it is “ thinking about how we can support those but this is not the focus of the current release ” .
The best things about the tools behind Power BI are the excellent self-serve BI tools in Excel , some of which are new incarnations of old products ( Power Map was previously GeoFlow , for example ) .
Revamping them and putting them all under the Power BI banner turns Excel into a more significant reporting tool , with promising opportunities for presenting real insights . ®
Referral Link spamming have been quite an issue the last few months . People were disguising referral links to get Cartel coins . I have seen people posting their referral link but make it appear like it was a link to something else , like a SWTOR guide or whatever . People would click on the link thinking they were going somewhere other than becoming that person 's referral . Pretty annoying stuff , but with today 's server maintenance , they made some changes . Now , when you click on someone 's referral link , it will prompt you with a confirmation dialog before accepting the referral . This was implemented to help stop any potential “ griefing ” that could occur from folks spamming their referral links .
Below is the official announcement from Eric Musco

Update on Referral Links on the Forums | 02.25.2014 , 10:06 AM
Hey everyone ,
I wanted to let you know that as a part of today 's maintenance , we made a change to how referral links work . Now , when you click on someone 's referral link , it will prompt you with a confirmation dialog before accepting the referral . This was implemented to help stop any potential “ griefing ” that could occur from folks spamming their referral links .
In lieu of this change we are going to be lifting some of our forum restrictions around referral links . You are once again allowed to place your referral links in your signatures . However , keep in mind that if you are found to be “ spamming ” your link around the forums , you can still be actioned . Any type of link spam is not permitted and this includes your referral .
Thank you everyone for your patience as we worked through this . Let me know if you have any questions .

SAN FRANCISCO – Moore 's Law coming to an end ? Not if you ask Intel , which announced Tuesday that it plans to offer chips based on a 22 nanometer process technology in the second half of 2011 .
The 22nm chip packs in more than 2.9 billion transistors into an area the size of a fingernail . That 's double the density of the 32nm chips that are currently the cutting edge ; most of Intel 's CPUs today are still based on a 45nm process .
Generally , the smaller the circuits in a computer chip , the more complex features the chipmaker can integrate into that chip . Small circuits also have the potential to increase the computing speed , but the tradeoff is increased power consumption , heat production , and – with very small circuits – increasingly large challenges in keeping the circuits electrically isolated from one another .
At the company 's developer conference here Tuesday , Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini ( above ) showed a silicon wafer containing the first working chips built on the technology . The 22nm test circuits include both SRAM memory and logic circuits that will be used in future Intel microprocessors .
`` We are moving ahead with development of our 22nm manufacturing technology and have built working chips that will pave the way for production of still more powerful and more capable processors , '' said Otellini .
Moore 's Law , first introduced by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 , postulates that the number of transistors on a cost-effective integrated circuit will double every two years . One way to describe how well transistors are packed is the smallest geometric feature that can be produced on a chip , usually designated in nanometers ( billionths of a meter ) .
In late 2007 , Intel started mass production of chips based on the 45nm technology . The company has said it plans to introduce 32nm processors early next year . By comparison , the Intel 4004 microprocessor introduced in 1971 was based on 10,000nm process . A human hair is approximately 100,000 nanometers .
The 22nm wafer is made up of individual die containing 364 million bits of SRAM memory . SRAMs are used as test vehicles to demonstrate technology performance , yield and chip reliability . Once the technology works on SRAMs , Intel will move to utilize it in CPU production .
At 0.092 square microns , the 22nm process based chips contain the smallest SRAM cell used in working circuits ever reported , said Intel .

Doctors Say Do n't Give Birth To Baby In A Tub , But Midwives Disagree
Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto
Hospitals are increasingly giving women the option of going through labor or giving birth in a pool of warm water . Laboring in the tub is fine , the nation 's obstetricians and pediatricians say , but there 's not enough proof that it 's safe to actually give birth in one .
The doctors ' statement has raised eyebrows among nurse-midwives , who have been helping women deliver in water for decades in order to ease pain and speed delivery .
`` I would consider warm water immersion during labor and birth a midwifery standard of practice , '' says Jenna Shaw-Battista , director of the Nurse-Midwifery Education Program at the University of California , San Francisco . `` We do n't believe that the [ doctors ' ] letter accurately portrays the growing body of research supporting water birth . ''
`` There 's actually pretty good evidence that it 's safe to labor in the tub , '' says Dr. Aaron Caughey , an associate professor of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of California , San Francisco , and a member of the committee that wrote the opinion , which was published Thursday . `` But there 's less good evidence that it 's safe for the baby and even safe for the mom , in terms of infection risk , to give birth in the tub . ''
And , of course , that 's the first thing people want to know : Is it safe ? The biggest fear is that a baby could draw its first breath in the water , then choke or drown . The doctors note individual case reports of drowning or near drowning , both at hospitals and home births , but those reports do n't give any sense of what the circumstances were or how common those incidents might be .
`` Case reports are the lowest form of evidence , '' Shaw-Battista counters . They are completing a study of 1,200 women who labored or birthed in water , and says they did as well or better than women who did not . `` Given the bulk of the data , I do n't think we should use case reports to reject options that women are currently enjoying . ''
It 's essential that water births be conducted with a trained professional , be planned , and follow established guidelines , Shaw-Battista says . That includes bringing the baby up to the surface right away , not putting the baby back in the water , and checking to make sure that the umbilical cord is long enough to lift the baby without damaging the cord .
A 2012 Cochrane review found no harm to the baby in 12 randomized controlled trials of water labor or birth involving 3,243 women , and less use of epidural anesthesia . But those kinds of trials are few and far between , despite the fact that the practice has made its way from home birth to being marketed by big academic medical centers .
That 's enough evidence for the United Kingdom , where obstetricians and midwives joined forces in 2006 to endorse aquatic labor , saying that though there was less evidence on underwater birth , complications are `` seemingly rare . ''
But in the United States , it 's hard not to get the sense that this also may be a bit of a battle for control over the birthing process .
`` I think this is backlash from the gaining popularity of water birth , '' says Barbara Harper , founder of Waterbirth International , an advocacy organization . Shots caught up with them in China , where she 's teaching doctors how to conduct water births . `` One thing that happens in a water birth , you as the attending physician pretty much have to stand there with your hands in your pockets and let it happen without your participation . That is pretty scary to a physician-oriented institution . ''
There are risks associated with water birth , Harper says , but they can be reduced by excluding women with high-risk pregnancies , health problems like diabetes and high blood pressure , or a previous C-section . Infection control is also critical , since the water can be contaminated with feces or blood , as it is having a doctor or midwife trained in water birth in attendance . `` When you follow those narrow criteria , it 's no riskier than delivering on a bed . ''
The VA Medical Center . ( Photo : 12 News )
The Department of Veterans Affairs ' crisis in health care came to a head in April 2014 at a meeting of the House Committee on Veterans ' Affairs .
Chairman Jeff Miller , R-Fla. , told their panel , `` It appears as though there could be as many as 40 veterans whose deaths could be related to delays in care '' within the Phoenix VA Health Care System .
The Arizona Republic reported the news the next day , along with allegations by a key whistle-blower . The Republic had been investigating the matter since late 2013 , when longtime VA physician Sam Foote told the newspaper that administrators were deliberately under-reporting the time veterans had to wait for medical care . Foote , who retired shortly thereafter , also took the matter to the Office of Inspector General and Congress .
RELATED : Obama schedules visit to Phoenix VA hospital
The news , including Foote 's allegations , traveled fast . Other whistle-blowers and angry veterans came forward in Phoenix and other cities with similar allegations and more , eventually prompting a flurry of media coverage and dozens of separate investigations .
The VA Office of Inspector General eventually confirmed that wait times had been falsified and that some veterans had died while awaiting care . When it came to light that executives had received bonuses based on bogus wait-time data , those payments were rescinded .
Fallout from the VA 's intense public scrutiny is ongoing . So far :
• VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned . Dr. Robert Petzel , undersecretary for health and second in command at the VA , and Susan Bowers , the VA regional director for Arizona , New Mexico and west Texas , were forced into early retirements . Sharon Helman , Phoenix VA 's top official , was fired and the action upheld by an administrative judge in December . Two other top Phoenix executives are under suspension pending disciplinary action .
• Investigations eventually were launched at more than 90 of the nation 's other VA medical facilities as a direct result of the disclosures in Phoenix , uncovering system-wide manipulation of wait times .
• Congress approved and President Barack Obama signed into law bipartisan VA reform legislation , including $ 16.3 billion to expedite care . The Veterans Access , Choice and Accountability Act empowers the VA secretary to more easily fire and replace executives for misconduct , negligence and incompetence . Congressional critics recently noted , however , that minimal disciplinary action has yet been taken .
• Some money appropriated under the VA act will expand the Phoenix-area 's network of VA facilities and satellite clinics and hire more doctors , nurses and support workers .
• The VA reached out to veterans sidetracked by the scheduling mess to get them appointments . Those unable to get VA appointments are being sent outside the system to private care . Veterans continue to complain of long waits , however , and Arizona Sen. John McCain said in a statement Tuesday that fewer than 1 percent of veterans who have received Choice Cards have been able to access medical care outside the VA .
• After removing key members from a Gulf War illness research advisory committee , including Phoenix resident and Chairman James H. Binns , the VA replaced them with medical experts with extensive knowledge of the affliction . The committee 's work potentially could affect roughly 250,000 veterans suffering complications from the illness .

Cub Swanson punches Dooho Choi during their UFC 206 bout , which has earned reviews as potentially the Fight of the Year for 2016 '' align= '' center '' / >
A great fight is a perfect storm . Put two fighters together and you never know what you 'll get , but when both have the intention of making a statement against each other and the styles mesh , it becomes something more than just an athletic competition . When that happens , there 's nothing better in all sports . Here are the best of 2016 .
1 . Cub Swanson-Dooho Choi
When the featherweight bout between Cub Swanson and Dooho Choi was announced , every fight fan worth their or their salt expected an epic battle that would steal the show at UFC 206 in Toronto . But did anyone really expect the fight to be this good ? Well , it was , with Swanson silencing any critics that made them the underdog and Choi proving that despite their status as a knockout artist , they were no frontrunner . In 15 minutes of high-level and fast-paced action , this was the best of mixed martial arts on display for the world to see .

2 . Conor McGregor-Nate Diaz II
Sure , the hype machine was in full effect leading up to this August rematch , but when put on the sport 's biggest stage for a second time , both Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz stepped up once more . Filled with drama from start to finish , McGregor started fast and Diaz finished strong , but it was “ The Notorious ” one who emerged victorious via decision , evening the score with Stockton 's finest and setting the stage for what fans hope will be a rubber match .
3 . Robbie Lawler-Carlos Condit
If we ever decide to start naming these awards , The Robbies may be an appropriate start , as it seems that Mr. Robbie Lawler is always a fixture in the Best Fight category . Their January win over Carlos Condit is the latest example of their action-packed brilliance , and the fact that we 're still talking about it in December shows you just how good this five-round war was .
4 . Steve Bosse-Sean O'Connell
Steve Bosse and Sean O'Connell may not be champions or top contenders , but there will always be a place for fighters like this in the Octagon , simply because when the cage door closes , they leave nothing up to chance . Their fists and feet – primarily their fists – are how they do their job , and if throwing them for 15 minutes at an opponent is the way to get that job done , they 're going to do it . This was classic brawling won by Bosse , but there were no losers here .
5 . Tyron Woodley-Stephen Thompson
You never know what a fighter is truly made of until they hit some adversity . At UFC 205 in November , both welterweight champion Tyron Woodley and Stephen Thompson had to show their true mettle , and each passed their test . In the process , those of us watching from outside the cage got a five round battle worthy of having the name “ world championship ” attached to it . Sure , the old sports adage is that a draw is like kissing your sister , but neither Woodley nor Thompson deserved to lose this one .

6 . Joanna Jedrzejczyk-Claudia Gadelha II
For world-class fighting at its highest level , look no further than July 's five-rounder between strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk and Claudia Gadelha . An intense fight from start to finish , Jedrzejczyk proved their championship mettle in the toughest fight of their career , and Gadelha showed that they have the talent and determination to make another run at the crown .
7 . Polo Reyes- “ Maestro ” Dong Hyun Kim
Like Bosse vs. O'Connell , Polo Reyes and “ Maestro ” Dong Hyun Kim paid no attention to their own safety in their UFC 199 opener , and for 11 minutes and 52 seconds , the crowd already in their seats at The Forum was captivated . For those who waited until the main card to show up , sorry , you missed one of the best fights of the year .

8 . Donald Cerrone-Matt Brown
Lost in the fanfare of the glorious bout between Cub Swanson and Dooho Choi was the fight that came right after it on the UFC 206 main card . As I 'm watching Donald Cerrone and Matt Brown throw down , it amazed me how quiet the Toronto crowd was . And it was understandable , because they were drained from Swanson-Choi , but here 's the opportunity to give the welterweight vets their due , as they put on a heck of a striking duel before Cerrone scored a highlight reel knockout in the third round .
9 . Tony Ferguson-Rafael Dos Anjos
Fighters act with confidence all the time . Whether they show it when it counts is another thing . Lightweight contender Tony Ferguson always shows it , and it was never more apparent than in the biggest fight of their career against Rafael Dos Anjos . Facing a hungry former champion , Ferguson took risks and battled RDA everywhere the fight went . Why ? Because they were confident that whatever they did , it was going to work . That was n't always the case , but in the end , they got the victory and yet another Fight of the Night bonus .
10 . Robert Whittaker-Derek Brunson
Put two of the middleweight division 's top rising stars – each with a five-fight winning streak – in the Octagon together , and you expect that there will be plenty of compelling action . And Robert Whittaker and Derek Brunson delivered on those expectations . What fans did n't know that all that action was going to get crammed into a little over four minutes . Sure , it was sloppy and frantic at times before Whittaker pulled off the victory , but if you were watching , you could n't look away . That 's a great fight .
Honorable Mention : Tony Ferguson-Lando Vannata , Joseph Benavidez-Henry Cejudo ,

McCain in Glenview to endorse Kirk in bid for Burris ' senate seat
The scene at the fundraiser in which former Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona endorsed 10th District Congressman Mark Kirk .
10th District Congressman Mark Kirk grins as they get the endorsement of former Republican Presidential nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona , in their bid to win the Illinois U.S. Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama .
Former Republican Presidential nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona endorses 10th District Congressman Mark Kirk in their bid to win the Illinois U.S. Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama and currently held by Roland Burris .
The man who ran against Barack Obama for president announced they are backing Illinois Congressman Mark Kirk for Obama 's old Senate seat .
Sen. John McCain was in Glenview Sunday to back Kirk 's bid to succeed Sen. Roland Burris .
Kirk is among more than a half dozen candidates vying for the Feb. 2 GOP primary nomination .
The event , which was a fundraiser for veterans , also provided an opportunity for both McCain and Kirk to take verbal swipes at Illinois and Washington politicians .
`` This election is at a very critical time for our state , '' Kirk said . `` Rod Blagojevich and Roland Burris have humiliated the state of Illinois , and we need to elect new leaders with a high level of integrity who will restore public trust . ''
McCain said they are not familiar with all allegations against Burris , but said , `` ( The ) stories have been disturbing about the governor and other aspects of the political scene here in Illinois , '' said McCain .
McCain attacked Washington politicians for pork barrel spending and adding trillions of dollars to the national debt . They branded Kirk as a fiscal conservative who will buck the trend .
`` Spending in Washington is out of control , '' McCain said . `` We now have record deficits and a national debt that is exploding . We need a senator that will hold the line on spending . ''
For their part , Kirk pledged to vote for lower taxes , lessen spending and borrowing and support smaller government . They said they would oppose earmarks , support the line-item veto , and `` make the balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution the law of the land . ''
McCain , a Vietnam War hero , also praised Kirk 's service to their country and their expertise on national security issues . Kirk , an intelligence officer in the Naval Reserve , has served in Kosovo , Bosnia , Haiti , Afghanistan and Iraq .
They are also involved in the effort to build a new veterans hospital in Lake County .
Kirk said caring for Americans who wear the uniform would be one of their top priorities in the Senate .
During a question-and-answer session , Kirk defended Republican opposition to Democratic health care proposals , saying their party offers better alternatives . They outlined three examples : the medical rights act that would protect decisions made between a doctor and patient ; insurance reforms that allow the purchase of out-of-state health insurance ; and defensive medicine reforms .
McCain defended the cap-and-trade legislation that they and Kirk have supported .
`` Many of us believe that climate change is real and is endangering our planet and that if we do n't take action to reduce and eventually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions that our very planet is threatened . ''
However , they said they are disappointed with the Obama administration 's rejection of nuclear power as an alternative .
They and Kirk also declared their disappointment with the Obama administration 's decision to investigate interrogation techniques during the War on Terror , even though McCain said they believe the United State violated the Geneva Convention rules against torture .
Kirk said , `` I do not believe we should put CIA officers in double jeopardy . I 'm worried that many CIA officers now working , for example , in Afghanistan may be more interested in finding a lawyer than bin Laden . ''

Airport is a 1970 American air disaster-drama film starring Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin , directed and written by George Seaton , [ 3 ] and based on Arthur Hailey 's 1968 novel of the same name . It originated the 1970s disaster film genre . [ 4 ] It is also the first in the Airport film series . Produced on a $ 10 million budget , it earned over $ 100 million . [ 2 ]
The film is about an airport manager trying to keep their airport open during a snowstorm , while a suicidal bomber plots to blow up a Boeing 707 airliner in flight . It takes place at fictional Lincoln International Airport near Chicago , Illinois . The film was a commercial success and surpassed Spartacus as Universal Pictures ' biggest moneymaker . [ 5 ] The movie won Helen Hayes an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for their role as an elderly stowaway and was nominated for nine other Academy Awards , including Best Picture , Best Cinematography , and Best Costume Design for designer Edith Head .
With attention paid to the detail of day-to-day airport and airline operations , the plot concerns the response to a paralyzing snowstorm , environmental concerns over noise pollution , and an attempt to blow up an airliner . The film is characterized by personal stories intertwining while decisions are made minute-by-minute by the airport and airline staffs , operations and maintenance crews , flight crews , and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers .
Ernest Laszlo photographed it in 70 mm Todd-AO . It is the last film scored by Alfred Newman and the last film role for Van Heflin and Jessie Royce Landis .
Plot [ edit ]
Chicago is paralyzed by a snowstorm affecting Lincoln International Airport . A Trans Global Airlines ( TGA ) Boeing 707 flight crew misjudge their turn from Runway 29 onto the taxiway , becoming stuck in the snow and closing that runway . Airport manager Mel Bakersfeld ( Burt Lancaster ) is forced to work overtime , causing tension with their wife , Cindy . A divorce seems imminent as they nurture a closer relationship with a co-worker , TGA customer relations agent Tanya Livingston ( Jean Seberg ) .
Vernon Demerest ( Dean Martin ) is a TGA captain scheduled to be the checkride captain for the airline to evaluate Captain Anson Harris during its Flight 2 to Rome . TGA 's flagship international service , named The Golden Argosy , is being operated with a Boeing 707 . Although Demerest is married to Bakersfeld 's sister , Sarah , they are secretly having an affair with Gwen Meighen ( Jacqueline Bisset ) , chief flight attendantess on the flight , who informs them before takeoff that they are pregnant with their child .
Bakersfeld borrows TWA mechanic Joe Patroni ( George Kennedy ) to assist with moving TGA 's disabled plane blocking Runway 29 . Mel and Tanya also deal with Mrs. Ada Quonsett ( Helen Hayes ) , an elderly lady from San Diego who is a habitual stowaway on various airlines .
Demolition expert D.O . Guerrero ( Van Heflin ) , down on their luck and with a history of mental illness , buys both a one-way TGA ticket aboard The Golden Argosy and a large life insurance policy with the intent of committing suicide by blowing up the plane . They plan to set off a bomb in an attaché case while over the Atlantic Ocean so that their wife , Inez , will collect the insurance money of $ 225,000 . Their erratic behavior at the airport , including using their last cash to buy the insurance policy and mistaking a U.S. Customs officer for an airline gate agent , attracts airport officials ' attention . Inez finds a Special Delivery envelope from a travel agency and , realizing D.O . might be doing something desperate , goes to the airport to try to dissuade him . They inform airport officials that they had been fired from a construction job for `` misplacing '' explosives and that the family 's financial situation was desperate .
Ada manages to evade the TGA employee assigned the task of putting them on a flight back to Los Angeles , talks their way past the gate agent , boards Flight 2 , and happens to sit next to D.O . When the Golden Argosy crew is made aware of D.O . 's presence and possible intentions , they turn the plane back toward Chicago without informing the passengers . Once Ada is discovered , their help is enlisted by the crew to get to D.O . 's briefcase , but the ploy fails when a would-be helpful male passenger unwittingly returns the case to D.O .
Captain Demerest goes back into the passenger cabin and tries to persuade D.O . not to trigger the bomb , informing them that their insurance policy will be useless . D.O . briefly considers giving Vernon the bomb , but just then another passenger exits the lavatory at the rear of the aircraft , and the same would-be helpful passenger yells out that D.O . has a bomb . D.O . runs into the lavatory , locks it , and sets off the device . D.O . dies instantly and is blown out of the aircraft through the hole in the fuselage caused by the explosion . Gwen , just outside the door , is injured in the explosion and subsequent explosive decompression , but the pilots retain control of the airplane .
With all airports east of Chicago unusable due to bad weather , they return to Lincoln International for an emergency landing . Due to the bomb damage , Captain Demerest demands the airport 's longest runway—Runway 29 , which is still closed due to the stuck airliner . Eventually Mel orders the plane to be pushed off the runway by snowplows , despite the costly damage they would do to it . Patroni , who is `` taxi-qualified '' on Boeing 707s , has been trying to move the stuck aircraft in time for Vernon 's damaged aircraft to land . By exceeding the Boeing 707 's engine operating parameters , Patroni frees the stuck jet without damage , allowing Runway 29 to be reopened just in time for the crippled Golden Argosy to land .
In a brief epilogue , Ada is enjoying their reward of free first-class travel on TGA . But as they arrive at the gate , they lament that it was `` much more fun the other way . ''

Production notes [ edit ]
Most of the filming was at Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport . A display in the terminal , with stills from the field and the film , says : `` Minnesota 's legendary winters attracted Hollywood here in 1969 , when portions of the film Airport were shot in the terminal and on the field . The weather remained stubbornly clear , however , forcing the director to use plastic 'snow ' to create the appropriate effect . ''
Only one Boeing 707 was used : a model 707-349C ( registration N324F [ 6 ] ) leased from Flying Tiger Line . It sported an El Al cheatline over its bare metal finish , with the fictional Trans Global Airlines ( TGA ) titles and tail . This aircraft later crashed during a landing while in service with Transbrasil , killing three crew members and 22 persons on the ground . [ 7 ]
Reception [ edit ]
Box office [ edit ]
Airport was released on March 5 , 1970 . It made $ 100,489,151 , and adjusted for inflation this was equivalent to $ 558 million in 2010 , the 42nd highest-grossing film of all time . [ 8 ]
Critical response [ edit ]
Variety magazine wrote : `` Based on the novel by Arthur Hailey , over-produced by Ross Hunter with a cast of stars as long as a jet runway , and adapted and directed by George Seaton in a glossy , slick style , Airport is a handsome , often dramatically involving $ 10 million epitaph to a bygone brand of filmmaking '' but added that the film `` does not create suspense because the audience knows how it 's going to end . `` [ 9 ] Film critic Pauline Kael gave Airport one of its worst contemporaneous reviews , scornfully dismissing it as `` bland entertainment of the old school . `` [ 10 ] `` There 's no electricity in it , '' they wrote ; `` every stereotyped action is followed by a stereotyped reaction . `` [ 10 ] Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and faulted a predictable plot and characters that `` talk in regulation B-movie clichés like no B-movie you 've seen in ten years . `` [ 11 ] Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and reported that while the theater audience cheered at the climax , `` it 's a long and torturous road to the applause . Blocking the path are speeches that promote the industry , dialog that ranks among the silliest in memory , and a labored plot that tells you everything twice . [ 12 ] Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it `` an immensely silly film—and it will probably entertain people who no longer care very much about movies . `` [ 13 ] Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called the film `` breath-taking in its celebration of anything which used to work when Hollywood was younger and we were all more innocent . `` [ 14 ] Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it `` a lousy movie '' that was `` utterly predictable . `` [ 15 ] The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote , `` Corny is really the only word for this unbelievably old-fashioned look at the modern phenomenon of an international airport : the one surprise is that the sweet old white-haired stowaway does n't spring to the controls and bring the distressed aircraft down single-handed as Doris Day did once upon a time in analogous circumstances . `` [ 16 ]
Christopher Null wrote in 2000 , `` With one grandiose entrance , Airport ushered in a genre of moviemaking that is still going strong -- the disaster movie ... Too bad the 'disaster ' does n't happen until 2 hours into the 2:15 movie . No matter -- Airport 's unending sequels and spoofs are a testament that this film is a true piece of Americana , for good or for bad . `` [ 17 ] Despite the film being the most profitable of Burt Lancaster 's career , they called it `` a piece of junk . `` [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 80 % , based on 15 reviews , with an average rating of 6.2/10 . [ 20 ] On Metacritic , the film holds an average rating of 42/100 , based on 5 critics , indicating `` mixed or average reviews '' . [ 21 ]

Author and top pro-Trump social media organizer Mike Cernovich talks about what they got right and wrong about the alt-right , in light of the events of the last week in Charlottesville , VA. Cernovich has been labeled a member of the `` alt-right , '' the `` alt-light , '' and the `` Trump right '' by different people , but in this video posted to their YouTube account Tuesday afternoon , they explained why the alt-right sounded appealing .
At first they thought it was exactly what it sounded like : An alternative to the mainstream right . It was only later that the `` Nazi boys '' took over the movement , Cernovich said .
`` When you get things wrong in life , it is important to talk about them , '' they explained . `` My view of the alt-right was that it was a big tent . [ I thought it ] was an edgier , aggressive , unapologetic version of the [ mainstream ] right . ''
They continued , talking about the Republican Party : `` When you think of the mainstream right you think of people like [ House Speaker ] Paul Ryan ... The Republicans controlled Congress and yet they rolled over for Obama on everything . So you think of Jonah Goldberg ... Rich Lowry ... dorks who do n't even go to the gym or take care of themselves , who beg to be on CNN and other shows , and are just horrified of being called nasty names by the media . They were conservatives , but they did n't actually conserve anything . ''
`` So we thought -- Oh , 'Alt-Right , ' that is an alternative to this . That makes sense , '' they said . `` We need an alternative to the right , and none of these so-called leaders [ of the alt-right ] , none of these 'Nazi boys ' told us we were wrong ? ''
`` None of these 'Nazi boys ' said no , actually , you 're not alt-right . The alt-right is about being a Nazi , Nazi salutes , letting people fly Nazi flags at your events , 100 % white nationalism . It was such a fringe marginal thing that they were more than happy to not say the alt-right was about the Nazi-flag kind of stuff . So that was the reality , '' they said .
`` So , now I know the alt-right is really about Nazi flags at their protests , about Nazis salutes at tailgates , '' they said .
They also said : `` The alt right is a disinfo group designed to discredit Trump , and to frustrate their agenda , which is why David Duke and all those guys go around saying they 're pro Trump . Why do n't you shut up about Trump ? Why do n't you just say you 're David Duke , and I have great ideas . They do n't have any ideas . They do n't have a book.There are no books out there articulating what the alt-right is . If they 're such great philosophers and they have such good ideas , and they 're on the vanguard of intellectualism , where are their books ? They do n't have any . That is why Richard Spencer and David Duke have to keep dropping Trump 's name . Why ca n't they just say we 're about ourselves . No , they always have to say Trump 's speech was about them , because that is how they get media attention . They 're an element whose sole purpose is to discredit Trump , so I had no idea what that was about . ''
`` If they are these 'cutting edge intellectuals , ' where are their books ? They do n't have any , '' they said about David Duke and Richard Spencer .
To any Nazis or white supremacists , Cernovich says : `` You need a lot of help , and I want those people to get help ... Rather than focus on hating on the Jews or whatever , I would focus on what went wrong with your life . That you do n't treat yourself right ... You 're not educating your mind . Where did you go wrong ? Let 's talk about it ... How can you improve your life ? How can you become better and live a fuller life ? ''
After gaining control of Congress in 2006 , Democratic leaders laid out goals : Achieve energy independence , strengthen national security , grow the economy and create jobs , lower energy prices , and begin to address global warming .
The energy legislation now pending in Congress – which raises taxes on the oil industry , repeals incentives designed to increase domestic oil and natural-gas production , and mandates increased use of `` renewable '' energy sources ( e.g. , wind , solar , and biofuels ) – will almost certainly achieve none of these objectives . Indeed , it will make things worse , especially with regard to energy security .
Energy security should not be confused with `` energy independence . '' The latter is a chimera , especially in this age of global interdependence . It is the mantra of those who stress `` renewable '' sources of energy .
But for technological and economic reasons , such alternatives are far too expensive and unreliable to compete on the market with oil and gas . That 's why they must be subsidized .
Advocates of energy independence would repeat the mistakes of the 1970s and early '80s , when the government tried to micromanage the energy market and pick winners and losers . The results were dismal then , and the outcome would probably be no different today . Apparently , Congress has not learned a basic lesson of economics : If something needs a subsidy to compete , it 's not ready .
While energy independence is a pipe dream , energy security , which focuses on increasing the supply of energy by exploiting all available sources , is achievable . For instance , rather than discouraging the production of domestic oil and natural gas , proponents of energy security suggest expanding access to nonpark federal lands in the West and Alaska and under coastal waters . These areas hold enough natural gas to meet the needs of the 60 million American homes fueled by natural gas for more than a century – and enough oil to produce gasoline for 60 million cars and fuel oil for 25 million homes for 60 years .
To achieve energy security , America must reverse its rejection of nuclear power . This source of energy is both efficient and safe . Key indicators of nuclear-plant performance – such as unplanned reactor shutdowns and radiation exposure – have shown high levels of safety at US nuclear power plants in the past decade .
During the 1990s , the efficiency of nuclear power improved by 36 percent , the equivalent of adding more than 23 1,000-megawatt power plants . Nuclear power ought to be embraced by environmentalists : It accounts for 75 percent of the nation 's clean power generation , and it is the only source of large amounts of continuously delivered energy that can make a decisive contribution toward reducing greenhouse-gas emissions .
Other options for tapping domestic sources of energy include recovering oil from shale , converting coal into liquid fuels , and exploiting the vast deposits of unconventional natural gas available domestically .
What proof is there that increasing the energy supply will enhance energy security ? The best example of how the market , not government pursuit of energy independence , adds to energy security is President Reagan 's decision to lift price controls on oil in 1981 .
The world price of oil plummeted , helping to fuel the extraordinary economic growth of the 1980s . One reason for this outcome should be clear . As long as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) cartel faced little competition in the production of crude oil , its members benefitted from keeping the commodity in the ground , confident that increasing demand would make it more valuable in the future .
Mr. Reagan 's deregulation of crude oil prices created incentives for domestic producers to invest in exploration and to increase production . The threat of increased output by non-OPEC producers destroyed the discipline among OPEC members necessary to restrict production to maintain high prices . Facing the likelihood that an increase in supply would lead to lower future prices , OPEC producers increased output in the hopes of maximizing profits before prices fell . The cascading effect caused oil prices to tumble .
As in the 1970s , today 's energy policies have essentially restricted the exploitation of domestic sources of energy . Curtailed supplies have combined with a rapid increase in worldwide energy demand to spike the price of oil and other sources of energy . This provides leverage to foreign producers and threatens US energy security . Freeing up domestic energy resources will do today what Reagan 's deregulation of oil prices in 1981 did then : cause oil prices to fall , thereby enhancing US energy security .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Nearly half of Britons are leaning toward voting to leave the European Union at a membership referendum due by the end of 2017 , according to a survey published on Thursday .
Prime Minister David Cameron will hold talks with other European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday to try to end an impasse over their attempts to win better membership terms ahead of the vote .
The survey funded by Michael Ashcroft , a former deputy chairperson of Cameron 's Conservatives , asked more than 20,000 people to place themselves on a scale between zero and 100 , with zero meaning they would definitely vote to remain in the bloc and 100 meaning they would definitely vote to leave .
It found 38 percent were inclined to remain , putting themselves between 0-49 , while 47 percent were leaning toward leaving , placing themselves between 51-100 . Ashcroft said 14 percent were completely undecided , placing themselves at 50 .
Ashcroft said a quarter of voters , questioned between Nov. 20 and Dec. 2 , said they did not have a strong view and could easily be persuaded to change their minds however .
Thirty-five percent said they would be more inclined to vote to remain if Cameron announced they had secured a better deal for Britain as a result of their renegotiation .
Asked what the biggest issues were at stake in the debate over Britain 's continued membership , immigration was the most popular answer , followed by control of borders .
Cameron is facing an uphill battle to secure agreement on their proposal to curb some welfare payments to EU migrant workers , with other EU leaders warning it would discriminate on grounds of nationality and therefore would be against basic EU law .
While 39 percent of those surveyed said Britain would never be able to bring immigration under control unless it left the bloc , a similar number , 37 percent , said they thought Britain would n't be able to control its immigration even outside the EU .
Voters were fairly evenly divided on the risks of so-called Brexit , with 53 percent saying leaving the EU carried a greater risk to Britain than remaining , and 47 percent believing the opposite .
It 's been a big year for horse breeder and lifelong Everett resident Ray Hanson . Lookin At Lee , a horse bred by Hanson , has been one of the top performers in this year 's Triple Crown . Lookin At Lee finished second at the Kentucky Derby , fourth at the Preakness , and is among the favorites in Saturday 's Belmont Stakes .
First , here 's a look at Lookin At Lee 's race in the Kentucky Derby on May 6 . To identify Lookin At Lee look for the horse that starts from Post No . 1 ( the furthest inside ) , with jockey Corey Lanerie wearing a bright red helmet with red and black striped silks . You 'll have to watch the back of the pack for much of the race , as Lookin At Lee goes immediately to the back , hugs the rail the entire race , and makes their move late :
So a good second-place finish by Lookin At Lee .
Now to the Preakness on May 20 . This time Lookin At Lee broke from post No . 9 , but again went straight to the back of the race . This time Lookin At Lee had to make its late move on the outside and was n't able to make up the kind of ground they did in the Kentucky Derby :
Saturday 's Belmont is the longest of the three Triple Crown races — the Belmont is 1 1/2 miles while the Kentucky Derby is 1 1/4 miles and the Preakness is 1 3/16 miles . Lookin At Lee is a finisher rather than a front-runner , so perhaps the extra distance plays to their racing style . In addition , Kentucky Derby winner Always Dreaming and Preakness winner Cloud Computing are not running the Belmont , while initial favorite Classic Empire was a late scratch . Senior Investment , who finished ahead of Lookin At Lee in the Preakness , is racing the Belmont ( Senior Investment did n't run in the Preakness ) . Lookin At Lee will have a new jockey for the Belmont in Irad Ortiz . Jr. , who is more familiar with the track than the Churchill Downs-based Lanerie .
There are 12 entrants in the Belmont . Lookin At Lee drew post No . 6 and as of Friday had odds of 5-1 , which made them third favorite behind Irish War Cry ( 7-2 ) and Epicharis ( 4-1 ) . The race is scheduled to start at 3:37 PST and will be televised on NBC .
The question arises because Jesus promised the criminal who was being executed alongside them a future life in Paradise . Jesus said : “ Truly I tell you today , You will be with me in Paradise. ” ( Luke 23:43 ) Note that Jesus did not say where that Paradise would be . Did Jesus mean , then , that the evildoer would join them in heaven ?
First , let us consider whether that evildoer met the qualifications for heavenly life . Humans with heavenly prospects have been baptized in water and with holy spirit and are thus spirit-begotten disciples of Jesus . ( John 3:3 , 5 ) Another requirement is that they conform to God 's moral standards and manifest such qualities as honesty , integrity , and compassion . ( 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 ) They must also remain loyal to God and Christ till the end of their earthly course . ( Luke 22:28-30 ; 2 Timothy 2:12 ) Only by meeting those requirements can they show themselves worthy of being resurrected and qualified for the weighty responsibility awaiting them in heaven , namely , serving as priests and kings with Christ over humankind for a thousand years.​—Revelation 20:6 .
In contrast , the evildoer alongside Jesus lived as a criminal and died as a criminal . ( Luke 23:32 , 39-41 ) True , they showed a respectful attitude when they said to Jesus : “ Remember me when you get into your kingdom. ” ( Luke 23:42 ) Nonetheless , they had not become a baptized , spirit-begotten disciple of Jesus , nor had they built a record of upright conduct and faithful endurance . Does it seem reasonable that Jesus would promise them heavenly kingship alongside their faithful followers who had proved their integrity ? ​—Romans 2:6 , 7 .
To illustrate : If a man asked your forgiveness for stealing your money , you might decide not to press charges . But would you trust them to run your business or to take care of your family ? You would reserve such responsibilities only for those in whom you had the utmost confidence . Likewise , those who are given the hope of life in heaven must provide a solid basis for confidence that they will uphold God 's righteous standards when they rule over humankind . ( Revelation 2:10 ) The evildoer , though apparently sincere in their last-minute plea , provided no such basis .
But did Jesus not tell the evildoer that they would be with them in heaven that very day ? That could not be , since Jesus themselves did not enter heaven that day . Instead , they were “ in the heart of the earth ” ​—the grave—​for three days . ( Matthew 12:40 ; Mark 10:34 ) Even after their resurrection , they remained on earth for 40 days before ascending to heaven . ( Acts 1:3 , 9 ) Thus , the evildoer could not have been in heaven with Jesus that day .
Into what Paradise , then , was the evildoer to enter ? After resurrection , they will be in the earthly Paradise , over which Jesus will rule . ( Acts 24:15 ; Revelation 21:3 , 4 ) To learn more about that Paradise and God 's requirements , speak to any one of Jehovah 's Witnesses .

Stipendium fürs Nichtstudieren : Alles , nur nicht Jura ! von Constantin Baron van Lijnden 10.10.2014 Bild : Willens Law
Leicht verdientes Geld : 1.000 US-Dollar hat Louise Kelly kürzlich vom Chicagoer Anwalt Matthew Willens erhalten . Alles , was sie dafür tun musste , war , nicht Jura zu studieren . Das eigenwillige Stipendium hat Willens ins Leben gerufen , um ein Zeichen gegen die Flut junger Juristen zu setzen , die die Nachfrage am amerikanischen Rechtsmarkt weit übersteigt .
Anzeige
Louise Kelly gibt Musikunterricht und studiert zugleich für einen Master in musikalischer Lehre . Sie könnte aber ebenso gut Eiskunstläuferin sein , Feuerwehrfrau oder Bäckerin . Für sein Stipendium in Höhe von 1.000 US-Dollar hatte der auf Schadens- und Unglücksfälle spezialisierte Chicagoer Rechtsanwalt Matthew Willens neben ein paar Formalia nur eine wesentliche Voraussetzung : Die Bewerber durften auf keinen Fall Jura studieren .
Der Rechtsberatungsmarkt in Illinois sei übersättigt , erklärte Willens seine ungewöhnliche Aktion , es gebe dort rund 90.000 Personen mit einer Anwaltszulassung – bei knapp 13 Millionen Einwohnern . Zum Vergleich : In Deutschland gibt es aktuell knapp 163.000 Anwälte auf knapp 81 Millionen Menschen .
Unter der Situation litten beide Seiten , so Willens gegenüber dem Rechtsblog AboveTheLaw : Die jungen Absolventen , die oftmals keine Jobs fänden oder zu kläglich niedrigen Löhnen arbeiten müssten , und die Mandanten , die unter Umständen bei einem überarbeiteten und unterqualifizierten Berufseinsteiger landen , der ihnen keine angemessene Vertretung zuteil werden lassen kann . Da ein rechtswissenschaftliches Studium ein sicheres Auskommen keineswegs mehr garantieren würde , könne er nur noch denen dazu raten , für die Jura eine große Leidenschaft sei .
Die schwierige Situation am Arbeitsmarkt , gepaart mit den oft horrenden Law School-Gebühren , macht vielen amerikanischen Jungjuristen zu schaffen und hat bereits recht abseitige Erwerbsmodelle beflügelt .
Einen Scheck über 1.000 US-Dollar hat Willens Kelly Anfang des Monats überreicht . Ob es für das Folgejahr eine Neuauflage des Stipendiums geben würde , konnte er nach einem Bericht von Red Eye Chicago noch nicht bestätigen .
OTTAWA—One of the most dramatic Canadian national security cases in recent memory — ending with the shooting of a bomb-carrying terrorism suspect on their way to a shopping mall — was obstructed for more than a year by unbreakable encryption , RCMP officials revealed in a detailed briefing to the Toronto Star and the CBC . Investigators had had suspicions of terrorist activity by 24-year-old Daesh supporter Aaron Driver since December 2014 . But they could n't gather enough evidence .
Video footage showing Aaron Driver is seen behind RCMP Deputy Commissioner Mike Cabana and Assistant Commissioner Jennifer Strachan during a press conference in Strathroy , Ont. , in August . The 24-year-old Daesh supporter was killed during a confrontation with police after a tip from the FBI . ( Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO )
“ Hindsight would say that they were obviously farther along in preparing , ” said Jeff Adam , the RCMP 's director general in charge of technical investigations services . In the end , it was the last-minute tip of an “ imminent ” threat from the FBI — it had spotted Driver 's martyrdom video — that foiled what might have been a mass killing . The tip came as Driver was preparing homemade explosives for a suicide bombing mission later that day . Police shot and killed Driver outside their home in Strathroy , Ont. , in August , just as they entered a cab to head to a shopping area in downtown London , Ont .

Contrary to what was reported at the time , the explosive device Driver carried was deadly . Full detonation in a public place would have caused “ death and grievous bodily harm , ” Adam said . An analysis of the bomb , obtained by the Star and CBC , shows that anyone within 2.1 metres ( about seven feet ) of the detonation would have faced death or serious injury , not including the impact of shrapnel “ fragmentation. ” Driver had embedded 139 ball bearings in the device that would have added to the carnage , the Star/CBC investigation has learned . The device did partially detonate in the taxi . But it was only a small portion of the much larger explosive , police confirmed .

Driver , seen in media images wearing a black balaclava , was the son of a Canadian Forces corporal . They converted to Islam in their early 20s and praised terrorist activities in social media posts , including the attack on Parliament Hill by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in October 2014 . Driver came close to succeeding by exploiting what police call “ going dark ” — the disappearance of evidence behind sophisticated digital privacy .

Police took a hands-off approach because Driver 's personal communications were encrypted , RCMP officials said . Investigators knew who they were talking to , but could never crack the content of their messages . Driver was arrested in June 2015 on suspicion that they might participate in the “ activity of a terrorist group ” or “ carry out a terrorist activity. ” But without sufficient evidence , they were placed under a peace bond and released .
“ We had significant and reasonable probable grounds to believe there are concerns with this individual , ” Adam said . “ The fact that they were out and available to do that is probably because we could not break the encrypted communications . And that 's going dark . ”
AI in fintech : 7 trends for 2017
Alex Housley Blocked Unblock Follow Jan 2 , 2017
Seldon has been working at the intersection between machine learning and fintech , and was part of the Barclays Accelerator London '16 cohorts . This perspective has given me a chance to observe some nascent trends for AI and machine learning in fintech that will define this year :
AI in Production – AI is only used by banks in production in a few key use cases such as high-frequency trading , fraud detection and credit scoring . In 2016 many machine learning R & D projects started across other business functions . In 2017 banks will move from testing machine learning models to putting models into production to make a real impact on business KPIs . Open-Source AI Platforms – Leading on from the last point , banks will have to consider if the best strategy for operationalizing models is to use a major cloud vendor , proprietary tech , open-source tech or in-house build . I think the winning combination is an open-source core machine learning platform supported by in-house R & D higher up the stack , and cloud provider focused mostly on the lower level compute tasks . Open Data – The new EU payments directive ( PSD2 ) compels banks to open up customer accounts data to third parties authorised by the customer . Access to richer datasets , which were previously a barrier to entry , creates opportunities for fintech to build better models , leading to more intelligent apps and services . Data Security 2.0 - Banks will upgrade data access and extraction procedures . Techniques such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption will enable secure end-to-end data access for internal and external projects and faster innovation cycles . AI Regulation – Banks and fintech companies will work alongside regulators to make clearer regulations that remove grey areas and speed up adoption and innovation . Some advanced techniques such as bias prevention , auditable and explainable of machine learning models will be essential for AI projects that move to production . Decision-Making - Automation will continue to progress from simple rules-based systems to complex augmented and autonomous decision-making systems . The Connecticut-based hedge fund Bridgewater is leading the charge as it seeks to replace more managerial functions with AI . Traditional banks will start experimenting with the same concepts , initially with smaller projects in isolated business units . Closer Collaboration – Banks will gain a competitive advantage by innovating faster in partnership with fintech start-ups . It 's a learning experience for all , and with each iteration processes are streamlined to make future projects more effective . Fintech accelerators will continue to grow and play a key role in connecting banks with fintech start-ups . Techstars Barclays Accelerator the gold standard that will continue to go from strength to strength in its new Shoreditch co-working space that connects alumni and members of the fintech community .

Iranian FM Javad Zarif Trolls Sen. Tom Cotton On the Occasion of Their Child 's Birth
Ever since international negotiators announced a framework nuclear agreement earlier this month , the Senate 's current uber-hawk , Tom Cotton of Arkansas , has been waging a very public campaign to kill the deal . And it just keeps on backfiring — most recently in a hilarious exchange with Iran 's foreign minister , Javad Zarif , that saw Tehran 's top diplomat offer the gentlest , most brutal of putdowns .
Serious diplomacy , not macho personal smear , is what we need . Congrats on Ur new born . May U and Ur family enjoy them in peace . @ SenTomCotton — Javad Zarif ( @ JZarif ) April 30 , 2015
After orchestrating a public letter , signed by 47 senators , to the leaders of Iran arguing that any sanctions relief would have to be approved by Congress , Cotton has emerged as the most prominent hard-line voice agitating against a nuclear deal with Tehran . But in remarks in New York Thursday , Zarif tried to sideline Cotton , saying that the United Nations would be primary avenue for sanctions relief , “ whether Sen. Cotton likes it or not . ”
That apparently struck quite the nerve with Cotton , who demanded that Zarif come to Washington for a debate on the Constitution .
Hey @ JZarif , I hear you called me out today . If you 're so confident , let 's debate the Constitution . 1/4 — Tom Cotton ( @ SenTomCotton ) April 29 , 2015
Here 's offer : meet in DC , @ JZarif , time of your choosing to debate Iran 's record of tyranny , treachery , & terror . 2/4 — Tom Cotton ( @ SenTomCotton ) April 29 , 2015
I understand if you decline @ JZarif after all , in your 20s , you hid in US during Iran-Iraq war while peasants & kids were marched to die 3/4 — Tom Cotton ( @ SenTomCotton ) April 29 , 2015
Not badge of courage @ JZarif , to hide in US while your country fought war to survive-but shows cowardly character still on display today 4/4 — Tom Cotton ( @ SenTomCotton ) April 29 , 2015
As we 've written about here at Foreign Policy , Cotton 's public campaign against the deal has been beset by problems . After unveiling their letter to Iran 's leaders about sanctions relief , Cotton faced intense criticism that they had undermined President Barack Obama 's authority to conduct U.S. foreign policy . To add insult to injury , the Farsi version of their public letter read like a middle schooler had written it .
It 's almost enough to feel sorry for Cotton . The Arkansas senator does , however , have quite the adorable child to go home to :

New York , NY — A video submitted to the Free Thought Project shows an NYPD cop repeatedly punch a 16-year-old teenager in the head over the weekend as onlookers watched in horror . What sets this video apart from others is that it shows bystanders intervene during the arrest .
As the Gothamist reported , the incident took place around 9:00 a.m. at the intersection of 225th Street and Broadway in Marble Hill , where officers from the 50th Precinct say they were responding to a teenager allegedly stealing a bicycle . On the scene , 16-year-old Alfred Burns allegedly “ began to struggle with officers and pushed one officer to the ground causing the suspect to fall on top of the officer , ” an NYPD spokesperson said Monday .
According to the NY Post , rushing to protect their partner , the other , burlier officer gets atop Burns , and proceeds to pummel him , landing a vicious series of hooks and jabs , as a third female officer cries out , “ Stop resisting ! ”
We do not see what happened prior to the video starting . However , it is clear that the teen is not only resisting but appears to be wrestling with the other officer . They were also wanted for multiple crimes .
“ No , do n't hit him ! Do n't hit him ! ” a woman screams off camera as others plead with the teen to “ Stop resisting . ”
As the struggle continues , one bystander steps in to help police . They grab the teen 's arm and begins pulling it back to allow the officer to place it in handcuffs . However , this does not appear to actually help and the massive cop continues to pound the teen 's face .
“ No , what are you doing ? What did you do ? ” a bystander shrieks repeatedly as the officer pounds the defiant teen , the footage shows .
“ No , that 's extra ! ” quips the person filming the video .
After seeing enough of the officer pound the teen 's face , another bystander steps in , this time to help the teen .
As the bystander grabs the officer 's arm , the first bystander , who was helping the cop , also grabs the cops arm . Briefly , the two men stop the officer from hitting the teen as they then yells at the crowd to get back .
A female officer then joins in and shows the other two cops how to properly handcuff a teen and the incident was then resolved .
According to the Post , Burns , of Morrisania , was arrested and charged with assault , petit larceny , resisting arrest , criminal possession of stolen property and giving a fake name , cops said . They were taken to Lincoln Hospital for treatment and released , police said .
In spite of Burns having been accused of committing a crime which warranted their arrest , a police spokesperson confirmed that melee “ is under investigation by the Internal Affairs Bureau . ”
According to the police , they say Burns was resisting because they were wanted in connection to another robbery from July .
What do you think ? Was this officer 's force justified ? Were the onlookers justified for stepping in ? Let us know in the comments below .

Niels passed away on January 20 . They were honored with a tribute at the end of Tuesday night 's episode of Ladies of London .
Caroline opened up about their father 's battle with cancer earlier this season of Ladies of London . They have mostly kept the details of their father 's health issues private and hesitated to discuss it with Marissa Hermer on Ladies of London before sharing the news that they had undergone a successful surgery .
Caroline has spent the days following their father 's death with family , celebrating their grandfather 's 95th birthday . `` Even in deep grief , these two incredible people , who we are thankful for every day , manage to bring smiles to our faces , '' Caroline praised their grandparents on Instagram .

Calls are growing for London Mayor Sadiq Khan to 'declare independence ' after the capital overwhelmingly rejected Brexit .
Almost 65,000 people signed a petition asking the Labour Mayor to 'declare London independent , and apply to join the EU ' - although it stops short of suggesting adopting the Euro is a good idea .
The hashtag 'Londependence ' has also started to trend on Twitter , with many of the capital 's young residents tweeting their feelings under # notmyvote .
Just five of London 's borough 's backed leaving the EU , with 60 per cent of the capital 's voters siding with Remain .
The vote was at odds with the rest of Britain , where support for Remain dropped to just 48.1 per cent , while 53.2 per cent of English voters chose to leave .
Alliance ? Sadiq Khan has already spoken to Nicola Sturgeon , who said today a new independence referendum is likely and said Scotland and London share a 'common cause '
Londoners also seem interested in independence , and have been showing their support for this petition , which calls for the capital to 'make the divorce official and move in with our friends on the continent '
While Khan is unlikely to take such petitions seriously , they did release a statement saying they still believed London was better off within the EU .
They also sent a message of support out to London 's immigrants .
' I want to send a particular message to the almost one million Europeans living in London , who make a huge contribution to our city - working hard , paying taxes and contributing to our civic and cultural life . You are welcome here , ' Khan said .
'We value the enormous contribution you make to our city and that will not change as a result of this referendum . '
But SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today said they could call a new independence referendum within months - because thirds of Scottish voters backed staying in the EU yesterday .
During a speech they also revealed they had already spoken to Khan because there is a 'is clear common cause between us ' .
Scotland , like London , overwhelmingly chose to back Remain .
Them comments gave hope to some who started using the hashtag # ScotLond , which began trending on Twitter .
Lucy Pasha-Robinson ‏tweeted : 'Do @ NicolaSturgeon 's discussions with @ SadiqKhan mean # ScotLond is going to happen ? Please ? # EUref ' .
Seyi Rhodes wrote : ' I 'm so pleased to hear that @ SadiqKhan has already spoken to @ NicolaSturgeon about # ScotLondon ' .
Supporters : Some have even created their own logo for the ScotLond movement - others have encouraged Sturgeon and Khan to 'keep talking '
Dudley Cruse said : ' I know it 's probably silly , but # ScotLond is the only thing giving me hope right now ' .
@ CaptainEllie tweeted : 'Half Scottish and my heart belongs to London , I 'm all for # ScotLond ' .
Workers in the Square Mile , the City of London , are bracing for months of pain as banks and financial institutions begin the process of considering whether to slash jobs or relocate to Europe in the wake of Brexit .
JP Morgan , HSBC and Goldman Sachs all said prior to the vote that thousands of jobs in the City of London could be moved to the continent in the event of Brexit .
Sarah Phillips , partner at solicitors Irwin Mitchell , said the Brexit vote will have a 'big impact ' on people working in Britain 's financial services sector .
They added : 'Many banks , insurers and fund managers who have large businesses in continental Europe could consider relocating to Paris or Frankfurt and senior staff will either lose their roles or have to move to another country .
All 32 local authorities in Scotland delivered a vote for Remain - Nicola Sturgeon this shows that their country was being pulled out against its will
False hope : Some comments were a light-hearted escape for Remain supporters after a devastating result for them
'Some global investment banks , such as JPMorgan , have said that Brexit would lead to a significant loss of jobs in the UK . '
HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver said in February that a vote to leave could see 5,000 London-based investment bankers move out of London to Paris . Jamie Dimon , head of JP Morgan , said earlier this month that up to 4,000 jobs could be hit .
Although banks have been cautious on Friday in making any brash statements regarding their future plans , experts are forecasting that large scale redundancies could be on the cards .
The Mayor of London 's office has strong links with Europe , and even has offices on the continent to bring in business .
But they lack the power to maintain links with EU and will not defy yesterday 's vote .
A Labour source told MailOnline : 'What they were talking about was to push for Britain to stay in the single market going forward .
If you 're a night owl , you know how much a regular white web page can hurt your eyes when you open it up . Here are two browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox that will make the web a little bit nicer at night .
We 've shared a few ways to make your screen more eye-friendly in the dark , but Google recently released an extension designed to make the web more night-friendly . Here 's the lowdown on it and a similar extension for Firefox .

High Contrast Inverts Colors on a Per-Site Basis in Chrome
Advertisement
Google 's official High Contrast extension for Chrome is pretty great . By clicking on its icon in your menu bar , you can invert the colors of your web pages , making blindingly bright black-on-white sites white-on-black for easier viewing . It ignores photos , too , so you can still see pictures without them looking like film negatives . You can also choose an inverted greyscale if the colors get too wonky for you .
What 's especially nice is that you can set it on a per-site basis , so if you frequent sites that already have `` night modes '' built in , you can ignore them from being inverted . And , you can set Ctrl+Shift+F11 to toggle inversion on any site you want . Above all , it actually looks good when it 's enabled—a lot of color inversion tweaks can really make your screen look weird , while this extension makes everything look somewhat natural .
Blank Your Monitor Lets You Customize Your Inverted Color Scheme in Firefox
Advertisement
Firefox users have a similar extension called Blank Your Monitor that , with a keyboard shortcut , will invert the colors in your browser for easier night reading . Unlike Google 's extension , however , you can open up the options and customize the colors for page backgrounds , text , and links , so it looks exactly how you want it to look . It also has a cool feature in which you can select text and press a keyboard shortcut to put it on a reader-friendly , inverted page .
That said , certain page elements can sometimes look weird with this extension ( like Google 's Instant Previews , page logos , and text boxes ) , so if you prefer an alternative , check out the Myflavolours userstyle , which also inverts your colors but leaves these things intact .
These are n't the only ways to make your browser more night-friendly , of course . OS X users have a built-in shortcut for inverting the entire screen , and apps like F.lux will change the color temperature automatically based on the time of day , but this is a slightly more extreme solution for those of us with ultra sensitive eyes . If you have any of your own solutions for nighttime screen brightness , share them with us in the comments !
BILLIONAIRE DENIS O'BRIEN has said it was a mistake for the government to suspend water charges until a commission examines the issue .
Fine Gael was forced to roll back on the issue in negotiations with Fianna Fáil , and the Irish business person told Bloomberg they believe the situation “ has n't worked out as well as it should ” .
“ I think the government were wrong to back down on the water , Irish Water , ” they said in an interview .
O'Brien said Irish Water was “ the right thing ” for the country , because the water supply infrastructure as it stands is Victorian .
So , that 's kicked in the air , and down the field , whereas it should have actually stayed . And the investment , you know there 's an investment programme of between three and four billion [ euro ] that was supposed to go into that . That now is under question .
“ I really do n't care who 's in power , but I think there needs to be stability in Ireland , ” they said , adding that they would be concerned about the impact instability would have on foreign direct investment .
Despite the agreement between the two parties about reexamining water charges , there is still a split between them on the issue . At the weekend , Fine Gael TD Regina Doherty also said they though the suspension was a mistake .
“ I think it will make it more difficult for us to re-introduce them , ” they said , speaking on RTÉ 's The Week in Politics .
Fianna Fáil TD Thomas Byrne defended their party 's record on water charges , rejecting claims they pushed for the suspension to save themselves from “ blushes ” after their election promises .
Now Fine Gael is meeting with independent TDs to see if they find the deal palatable , and to listen to demands they have before they agree to support the minority government .
True Sadness is an album about duality . It would have to be , really , for the boys behind the big-smiled , unbridled , foot-stomping joy on-stage at an Avett Brothers show to be naming a record something that sounds like such a drag . From lyrical jabs at the aging process to a well-rounded foray into new instrumentation , the Avett Brothers ' effort catapults the listener and its authors into a sort of maturity where sadness is n't a monumental event , but rather an underlying part of everyday life .
“ It 's not necessarily this ongoing bummer , ” Seth Avett says . “ True sadness is n't about becoming this dark thing , where you 're just giving up and realizing , ‘ You know what ? Screw it . Everything sucks . ' It 's more about just sort of accepting , as Bob [ Crawford ] , our bass player , has very eloquently put it many times , that the human heart is fully capable of experiencing great joy and great sadness simultaneously . ”
For True Sadness , the band 's fourth consecutive full-length working with producer Rick Rubin , every song began with a bare-bones recording using only the core trio of Seth , Scott Avett , and Crawford . Then , the songs were recorded with the full seven-piece band all live in the same room — a studio setup they had n't pursued since 2007 's breakout record , Emotionalism . They did n't stop there : With Rubin 's assistance , a third step brought the final tracks well outside of their boundaries , instrumentally .
“ We worked with another engineer who took the raw tracks and sort of re-imagined them with all these different samples and synths — just all these crazy sounds , ” says Seth . Then they re-performed every song with the added depth of the tape sounds and synths , with certain tracks maintaining more of the new territory than others .
“ What we ended up with was about four versions of every song , ” Seth offers . “ 'You Are Mine ' ended up being one of those that was in , like , that third stage … third or fourth stage … it 's kind of everything mixed up in one . ”
While this experimental , synth-stained streak reveals itself most clearly on tracks like “ You Are Mine ” and “ Satan Pulls the Strings , ” the energy behind the songs is unmistakably created by the same band that came up screaming and stomping their way through Southern stages .
“ The simple answer here is that we do our best to just follow the song . Whichever way the song is represented best , that 's the way we leave it . We try not to get too caught up in how we 're perceived , ” Seth says . “ Like , ‘ Well , we 're an American Roots band or and Americana band , so every song has to have only acoustic instruments ' and all that . We 've never really felt any kind of allegiance toward that . [ If ] one song was kind of an oddball , [ it 's because ] it felt right like that . ”
While the band is tapping into new sounds for True Sadness , they continue to thrive thematically with material that can be continuously re-interpreted by the listener : On standout track “ Smithsonian , ” the narrator rails through universal truths about aging like they 're breaking news . The song zeroes in on the strange quality of certain lessons or life changes that you have to experience yourself to truly understand , keeping pace with the album 's overall perspective .
“ It 's a lot about resolve , ” says Seth . “ Just coming to a resolution about breaking down , and how that is completely , 100 percent natural — 100 percent normal — and it 's all good . It 's fine ! ”
A scroll back through the Avetts ' catalog almost feels prescient . Lyrics like the forlorn mention of elections on “ Head Full of Doubt , Road Full of Promise ” feel almost political today , where they may have once felt coming-of-age . The Avetts ' songs evolve with the listener in a way that 's given them a timeless quality , and True Sadness expands upon that facet of their music admirably .
“ The truth remains the truth , ” Seth muses . You wo n't hear the Avetts proselytizing about current events — despite the ongoing controversy in their home state of North Carolina — but that 's not to say there are n't takeaways that feel bigger than heartbreak or personal strife . “ If you have your heart in the right place and you 're making your comments about humanity from the right place , ” they say , “ I think that it soars above the bickering within the political landscape . ”
Lead single “ Ai n't No Man ” makes a strong argument to that point : “ Ai n't no man or men that can change the shape my soul is in / There ai n't nobody here who can cause me pain or raise my fear. ” You can take it as a personal pick-me-up , a nod to religion , or a knowing wink at current events , but you certainly wo n't come away from the song feeling weighed down .
“ It 's meant to be self-motivating — a little bit of currency to buy yourself a little confidence when you 're not feeling so confident , ” they say . “ We do n't always wake up in the morning thinking , ‘ All right ! Now I 'm gon na knock it out today . I 'm going to be joyful and I 'm gon na be confident , but I 'm also gon na contribute ! ' Some days , you 're stepping into ‘ em feeling just like a wounded animal . It just takes everything you 've got to act civilized , in a way . So I think the song is a little like just giving yourself a motivational speech , and just getting solid and getting centered and kind of squaring your shoulders up , picking your head up , and just getting into it . ”
True Sadness was announced to the world in an open letter about the ways that the Avetts ' music has become intertwined with their real lives , pointing from the very beginning to the heightened thematic complexity in each number .
`` It does occur to me now , that in some regard , before any professional success , we were perhaps paradoxically more self-aware . The songs would show mere versions of ourselves — the heartbroken introvert , the frantic worker , the forlorn traveler , the philosopher , the romantic , the loner — all somehow imbued with the meaningful sheepishness of a James Dean character . We used to hope and vie for that attention , that perceived personality , that coolness . ''
If their previous work was about compartmentalizing the parts of themselves that feel , True Sadness abandons the pursuit of cool in favor of a pursuit of the optimistic and honest . “ You have to come to a place of resolution within the tragedies that are always happening , ” says Seth . “ You do n't ever get to a point in your life , regardless of how well things are going , where everything is good — where it 's all good . There 's always going to be a duality , and I think we are all more aware of it than ever . ”
Leave it to the Avett Brothers to serve up True Sadness and leave us mostly with real , gritty , imperfect joy .

US financial technology company Equifax said it will create 150 jobs in Dublin over the next 12 months , bringing its total Irish workforce to more than 350 .
Equifax , which is based in Atlanta , opened a new IT Development Centre in Dublin last September .
It also employs 100 people at a separate facility in Wexford .
Equifax provides information that enables consumers , businesses and governments to compile and monitor credit scores .
The company 's Dublin IT Development Centre develops new and advanced solutions for its global customers .
The jobs announced today will mostly be filled by software engineers , business analysts , and other IT specialists .
`` Ireland today is a globally recognised tech hub , and we are building a diverse , highly-skilled team who are at the forefront of excellence in innovation , '' said Mark Rohrwasser , interim chief information officer at Equifax .
`` It 's exciting to be part of Dublin 's highly-sophisticated technology market , '' they added .
Martin Shanahan , IDA Ireland 's chief executive , said that Equifax has greatly bolstered Dublin 's reputation as a tech hub within Europe by choosing to double its Irish workforce just a year after opening its Dublin IT facility .
`` This expansion also demonstrates that Ireland has both the necessary business infrastructure and talent pool to continue to attract global services companies here , '' Mr Shanahan added .
The company is in the middle of cleaning up after a major data breach in which information on over 145 million consumers was stolen by hackers including names , social security numbers , birth dates and addresses of people across the US and Canada .
The data included social security numbers , birth dates and addresses of people across the US and Canada .
Flu season has officially started , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
Flu activity around the country is high enough that health officials announced today ( Dec. 3 ) the season is under way . It 's the earliest start to the season since the 2003-2004 flu season , excluding the 2009 pandemic , said Dr. Thomas Frieden , director of the CDC .
States in the southeast — including Alabama , Mississippi , Texas and Louisiana — are seeing particularly high rates of flu cases .
While the course of a flu season is always unpredictable , this year 's early start and the specific strains circulating suggest `` this could be a bad flu year , '' Frieden said .
Last year , flu season did not begin until late February , which was the latest start in 24 years .
The level of flu activity that health officials are seeing now is usually not seen until January .
Fortunately , the strains in this year 's flu vaccine closely match the strains in circulation , Frieden said .
If you have n't been vaccinated yet , it 's time to get your shot , Frieden said .
`` Vaccination is by far the best tool we have to protect ourselves against flu , '' they said . About 37 percent of the U.S. population ages 6 months and older have been vaccinated so far , the CDC said .
Pass it on : Flu season has officially begun .

May Day celebrations were held all across the fruited plain , with leftist radicals and unionists worshipping the ideals of communism . Communism is an ideology calling for government control over our lives . It was created by Karl Marx , who — along with their collaborator , Friedrich Engels — wrote a pamphlet called `` Manifesto of the Communist Party . '' In 1867 , Marx wrote the first volume of `` Das Kapital . '' The second and third volumes were published posthumously , edited by Engels . Few people who call themselves Marxists have ever even bothered to read `` Das Kapital . '' If one did read it , they would see that people who call themselves Marxists have little in common with Marx .
For those who see Marx as their hero , there are a few historical tidbits they might find interesting . Nathaniel Weyl , themselves a former communist , dug them up for their 1979 book , `` Karl Marx : Racist . '' For example , Marx did n't think much of Mexicans . When the United States annexed California after the Mexican War , Marx sarcastically asked , `` Is it a misfortune that magnificent California was seized from the lazy Mexicans who did not know what to do with it ? '' Engels shared Marx 's contempt for Mexicans , explaining : `` In America we have witnessed the conquest of Mexico and have rejoiced at it . It is to the interest of its own development that Mexico will be placed under the tutelage of the United States . ''
Marx had a racial vision that might be interesting to their modern-day black supporters . In a letter to Engels , in reference to their socialist political competitor Ferdinand Lassalle , Marx wrote : `` It is now completely clear to me that he , as is proved by their cranial formation and their hair , descends from the Negroes who had joined Moses ' exodus from Egypt , assuming that their mother or grandmother on the paternal side had not interbred with a nigger . Now this union of Judaism and Germanism with a basic Negro substance must produce a peculiar product . The obtrusiveness of the fellow is also nigger-like . '' Engels shared Marx 's racial philosophy . In 1887 , Paul Lafargue , who was Marx 's son-in-law , was a candidate for a council seat in a Paris district that contained a zoo . Engels claimed that Lafargue had `` one-eighth or one-twelfth nigger blood . '' In a letter to Lafargue 's wife , Engels wrote , `` Being in their quality as a nigger , a degree nearer to the rest of the animal kingdom than the rest of us , they are undoubtedly the most appropriate representative of that district . ''
Marx was also an anti-Semite , as seen in their essay titled `` On the Jewish Question , '' which was published in 1844 . Marx asked : `` What is the worldly religion of the Jew ? Huckstering . What is their worldly God ? Money . ... Money is the jealous god of Israel , in face of which no other god may exist . Money degrades all the gods of man — and turns them into commodities . ... The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew . Their god is only an illusory bill of exchange . ... The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant , of the man of money in general . ''
Despite the fact that in the 20th century alone communism was responsible for more than 100 million murders ( http : //tinyurl.com/zafgs5p ) , much of the support for communism and socialism is among intellectuals . The reason they do not condemn the barbarism of communism is understandable . Dr. Richard Pipes explains : `` Intellectuals , by the very nature of their professions , grant enormous attention to words and ideas . And they are attracted by socialist ideas . They find that the ideas of communism are praiseworthy and attractive ; that , to them , is more important than the practice of communism . Now , Nazi ideals , on the other hand , were pure barbarism ; nothing could be said in favor of them . '' That means leftists around the world will continue to celebrate the ideas of communism .
No new advances planned for Wednesday after poor weather hampers visibility for aircraft and drone support
Iraqi special forces are holding their positions in Mosul a day after entering the Islamic State-held city for the first time since 2014 .
Amid poor visibility for the US-led aircraft and drones that have backed Iraqi forces in their assault on the country 's second largest city , special forces general Haider Fadhil told Associated Press no new advances within Mosul were planned for Wednesday .
Fighting continued on the southern approaches to the city , where Iraqi troops took four small villages .
Baghdad said on Tuesday its elite troops had breached the eastern suburbs of Isis 's last major urban stronghold in Iraq , creating a toehold in the Jdeidet al-Mufti neighbourhood after two weeks of combat and heralding a fierce urban battle in the weeks ahead .
Special forces units also entered the neighbourhood of Gogjali inside the city 's limits and took control of the local state television building . Reports said guns had largely gone silent in Gogjali after intense fighting on Tuesday but sporadic rifle and artillery fire could be heard .
Troops in Gogjali could be seen going house to house while sappers searched the road for explosives and booby traps left behind by the jihadis .
General Abdul-Ghani al-Asadi , the top counterterrorism forces commander , told reporters a curfew had been imposed in the neighbourhood while gains there were being consolidated .
Concerns have mounted over the fate of civilians , with Isis accused of using them as human shields to slow the alliance 's advance . The Norwegian Refugee Council , which works with refugees and internally displaced Iraqis , warned that the lives of more than 1 million civilians trapped inside Mosul were “ in grave danger ” as Iraqi troops advanced .
The council 's Iraq chief , Wolfgang Gressmann , said the agency 's aid workers “ are now bracing ... for the worst . The lives of 1.2 million civilians are in grave danger , and the future of all of Iraq is now in the balance. ” The organisation said about 18,000 Iraqis had fled their homes since the start of the military operation to retake the city .
Mosul was conquered in a lightning Isis advance in the summer of 2014 , falling to the militants along with much of the surrounding Nineveh plains .
Two weeks ago , Iraq announced a major campaign to liberate the city , the last in a line of urban bastions that had been taken by Isis and reclaimed over the past year , including Tikrit , Ramadi and Fallujah .
The battle for Mosul will be the toughest test yet for Iraqi forces , who are converging on the city alongside Kurdish peshmerga , Sunni tribal fighters and Shia militias , tasked with blocking a potential retreat for the militants into the eastern desert of Syria . The coalition is backed by American air power and military advisers on the ground .
The estimated number of civilians inside Mosul has fluctuated from 1-2 million , making it by far the largest city under Isis control and a key flank of the group 's self-proclaimed but quickly receding caliphate .
The eastern half of Mosul , which is divided by the Tigris river , would be first to fall from Isis control , and the group is believed to have booby-trapped the bridges into western districts . Isis is believed to have 5,000-6,000 fighters holed up in the city , though US officials have said in recent days that senior leaders of the group were attempting to flee .
The FBI 's annual Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted report for 2016 was finalized Monday and shows substantial increases in all relevant categories . Most saliently , the number of officers “ feloniously killed ” in the line-of-duty jumped to 66 , a 61 percent increase over 2015 .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the new numbers “ as shocking as they are unacceptable ” in an accompanying press release .
The feloniously killed category is a narrow one . Sixty-two of those 66 officers died of gunshot wounds , with the last four dying after being hit by motor vehicles . The 66 officers feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2016 is the highest single-year figure since 1997 .
The single most common category of officer slaying and the largest increase recorded was the 17 “ ambush ” type premeditated killings in 2016 , a 142 percent increase over the seven such attacks in 2015 . Breitbart News has reported extensively on these attacks , the most egregious of which left five Dallas , Texas , police officers dead after a black nationalist opened fire at a July 2016 Black Lives Matter rally .
An additional 52 officers died in accidents while on duty , for a total of 118 line-of-duty deaths , a 37 percent increase over 2015 .
The number of assaults on officers also increased significantly in 2016 , with over 57,000 recorded nationwide . This figure represents a 14 percent increase over 2015 and a rate of more than 150 a day and nearly one assault for every ten police officers in the country .
Attorney General Sessions was confident President Trump 's law-and-order agenda could bring the increase , which occurred under the previous administration , under control . “ Our law enforcement deserves the support of the people they serve . Fortunately we have a President who understands this , ” they said . “ President Trump ran for office as a law-and-order candidate ; now they are governing as a law-and-order President . ”
Sessions went on to cite Executive Order 13744 on “ Preventing Violence Against Federal , State , Tribal , and Local Law Enforcement Officers , ” one of the president 's first official acts . They said :
In one of their first Executive Orders to [ the Justice ] Department , President Trump directed us to prevent violence against law enforcement officers . They stand with our law enforcement 100 percent—and so does this Department of Justice . That 's one more reason why we 're focused on the President 's goal of reducing violent crime and united with local , state , and federal law enforcement in our shared mission to protect law-abiding people in every community .
While official FBI numbers for 2017 will not be available until roughly this time next year , National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund estimates show a substantial drop in fatal police officer shootings so far this year . According to those figures , 19 percent fewer officers have been shot and killed compared to this time in 2016 .
I-405 tolling bill moves forward in Olympia
State House members , after a lengthy debate , on Saturday narrowly approved a controversial bill calling for charging tolls on lanes of Interstate 405 .
The vote was 52 to 46 , largely along party lines , in the second attempt in a year to establish toll lanes on the crowded Eastside freeway .
The measure now goes to the Senate , which could add a pivotal amendment . The bill 's chief sponsor , Rep. Judy Clibborn , D-Mercer Island , echoed other backers who think tolls are needed to finance other improvements on the route .
`` Statewide money can not cure what 's going on in King County and in the Central Puget Sound area '' on highways , Clibborn said in a House floor speech . `` We need to have other tools . ''
Republicans tried unsuccessfully to amend the bill to keep tolls off of lanes built with gas-tax money and to allow private development of new tolled lanes . The said an experimental set of such `` high occupancy toll '' ( HOT ) lanes on Highway 167 has n't worked well .
`` It 's not been that successful , quite honestly , '' said Rep. Jay Rodne , R-North Bend .
The measure directs the state Department of Transportation to develop and begin operating the system , which would be similar to those on 167 .
The plan is to designate I-405 HOT lanes in each direction , including parts of segments that would be built starting next summer , as `` express toll '' lanes open to buses and carpools . Like 167 , the lanes would be open to solo drivers who 'd pay a toll to use them with tolls that would vary with time of day and traffic . A system could be in place by 2014 if lawmakers approved it this year .
Similar legislation passed the House last year but died in the Senate due to lack of support from cities along the corridor and questions over whether carpools should include at least two people or three . The new bill does n't address the carpool question but would leave it to the transportation agency .
The department estimates that adding new lanes between Bellevue and Lynnwood would cost $ 388 million . Equipping the new lanes and one existing one for tolling would cost $ 67 million and the system would cost $ 8.75 million annually to operate .
Ultimately , toll backers hope to create a tolled-lane system extending from Lynnwood south beyond Auburn on 405 and 167 . The I-405 tolls have not yet been set but Clibborn , who chairs the House Transportation Committee , said they `` could raise enough revenue to fund the rest of the corridor ( improvements ) from Lynnwood to Puyallup at some point . ''
Officials have talked for years about adding tolls to some highways because of predictions that state gas tax revenues will decline as cars become more efficient and more hybrids and electric models hit the roads .
Rep. Mike Armstrong , R-Wenatchee , proposed allowing a private venture to build the HOT lanes , run them until it repays its investment and then turn them back to the state to operate permanently .
They said this would save the state the initial investment and would n't leave motorist in the position of building them with gas tax money and then paying to drive on them . Their party members `` would like to see the business world get into the process and build us some transportation lanes , '' they said .
Clibborn opposed the move , saying the 405 toll lanes also would be an experiment , in which the state could first see how much money they raise , then decide whether to have them privately operated . `` We have n't precluded any decisions , '' they said .
Clibborn 's counterpart , Senate Transportation Committee chairperson Mary Margaret Haugen , D-Camano Island , has proposed adding private-development language to the bill in their chamber . Clibborn , in an interview , predicted that move would ultimately kill the bill . House Speaker Frank Chopp , D-Seattle , opposes privatization of highways .
The 167 HOT lanes , so far , have cost more to operate than they raise in toll revenue . But state Department of Transportation officials say those lanes have been successful in other ways , improving traffic flow and speeds . The state Office of Fiscal Management estimates that an I-405 toll lane operation , with far larger traffic volumes , would be profitable to the state for at least the first six years of its operation .
That has n't convinced other critics , like members of the Eastside Transportation Association and Eastside Developer Kemper Freeman Jr. , who are trying to kill the bill .
Several other states operate HOT lanes . Two more are being built in Texas , one in Florida and another in the Washington , D.C. area .
The first such lane in the country was on Highway 91 in Orange County , Calif . It was privately built and operated initially but was eventually taken over by the county . Jennifer Ziegler , a spokesperson for the Washington transportation department 's toll division , said the original development agreement limited the county 's ability to expand other nearby roads , to protect the private toll income . The county `` bought out the private ( toll ) investors to enable further improvements to the corridor , '' Ziegler said .
Also Saturday , the state House , acting to comply with a citizen initiative , formally approved a schedule of tolls that will be charged on the 520 Bridge beginning this spring .
The vote , after a brief discussion was 73 to 25 .
The state 's advisory Transportation Commission adopted a toll schedule in January . Rates will vary by hour and day of the week , but the highest rates will be during commuting hours . Those will range from $ 3.50 each way for drivers with an electronic `` Good to Go '' pass to $ 5 each way for drivers who pay by mail .
The commission has been given responsility by legislators to adjust tolls but the rates were adopted in January subject to final okay by lawmakers . The House passed a Senate bill including the rates , to comply with Initiative 1053 , which requires that fees such as tolls may only be imposed or increased with majority legislative approval .
The new bridge is expectd to be open by 2014 .
It 's that time of the year—when fantasy football fans take to making their draft picks . But rather than relying on blind intuition , utilizing the wisdom of crowds will put your picks above the experts almost every time .
In their remarkable book , `` The Wisdom of Crowds '' James Surowiecki tells the story of Francis Galton , a British scientist who in 1906 stumbled across a competition at a local fair . The goal was to guess the weight of an ox .
`` Eight hundred people tried their luck . They were a diverse lot . Many of them were butchers and farmers , who were presumably expert at judging the weight of livestock , but there were also quite a few people who had , as it were , no insider knowledge of cattle . … `` [ Galton ] turned the competition into an impromptu experiment . … [ A ] mong other things , they added all the contestants ' estimates , and calculated the mean of the group 's guesses . That number represented , you could say , the collective wisdom of the Plymouth crowd . … `` Galton undoubtedly thought the average guess of the group would be way off the mark . After all , mix a few very smart people with some mediocre people and a lot of dumb people , and it seems likely you 'd end up with a dumb answer . But Galton was wrong . The crowd guessed that the ox , after it had been slaughtered and dressed , would weigh 1,197 pounds . After it had been slaughtered and dressed , the ox weighed 1,198 pounds . In other words , the crowd 's judgment was essentially perfect . ''

Here we 'll talk about using the wisdom of crowds when drafting your fantasy football team . The result ? First , a better team—you 'll see below how fantasy football crowd beat ESPN 's top expert over the past three seasons . But it 's also substantially less work . No need to examine A.J . Green 's redzone target conversion percentage to see how it stacks up against Dez Bryant . No more tiers or formulas . Instead , you 'll be able to feel confident about your draft with 20 minutes of preparation .
Utilizing the wisdom of crowds does not mean polling thousands of people on every player in the NFL . Instead , we have effectively the same thing in results from thousands of actual fantasy drafts . The key metric is each player 's average draft position ( ADP ) . This is exactly what it sounds like—if Adrian Peterson is the # 1 pick in 500 leagues and # 2 in another 500 , their ADP is 1.5 . The lower a player 's ADP , the more valuable fantasy owners collectively view him . We can view ADP as a consensus on many factors , e.g . off-season development , supporting cast , injury risk—even `` I should n't draft them here , I can probably wait and get them later . '' It 's all priced in .
The hypothesis : ranking players according to their ADP gives us a cheatsheet that 'll rival any expert . To test it , let 's look at how ADP stacks up against the world 's most famous fantasy expert in Matthew Berry of ESPN .

The Crowd vs ESPN 's Matthew Berry
We 'll start by taking the difference between Berry 's rankings and ADP rankings for each position . So in the table below , last year Berry had Andrew Luck as the 12th best QB . The `` crowd '' had them at 9 ( i.e . they were the 9th QB drafted on average ) for a difference of 12 – 9 = 3 . The larger the difference , the more the crowd valued a player relative to Berry .
Here are a few more players to get the gist of it :
Player Team Position ADP ESPN Diff Luck , Andrew IND QB 9 12 3 Manning , Eli NYG QB 13 15 2 Manning , Peyton DEN QB 3 3 0 Newton , Cam CAR QB 5 5 0 Palmer , Carson ARI QB 20 17 -3

One way of checking who did better on average is to look at the relationship between this difference and actual points scored . If larger differences ( ESPN minus ADP ) are associated with players scoring more points on average , then that means the crowd 's judgment is better than Berry 's . If ESPN minus ADP is associated with fewer points , then Berry wins . We can find this relationship using a simple linear regression .
So what 's the verdict ? Total , over three years ( 2011-2013 ) times four ( QB , RB , WR , TE ) positions , the crowd beat Berry 4-1 . The rest were too close to call ( technically , the relationship between ESPN minus ADP and points was n't statistically significant from zero ) . One way of looking at this : ADP does as well as , or better , than Berry 92 % of the time . Not bad for a strategy that takes a fraction of the time to implement . Want to check out the analysis yourself ? You can download the data and code here .
We do n't mean to pick on Berry , who seems like a cool guy and a good case-study in making things happen for yourself . They just happens to be the most prominent expert out there ( plus their pre-season rankings from the past few years are helpfully still up online ) .
Advertisement
And obviously , just because this strategy beats Berry ( by one metric ) does n't necessarily mean it 'll beat every expert every year . These were the only ones tested . We would be willing to bet however , that many expert rankings would fare similarly . Really this should make any fantasy draft expert a bit nervous , because the strategy works on so many levels . It 's more accurate , takes less time to implement , and is free .
With that , let 's get into the nuts and bolts of implementation .
Get the Average Draft Position Data
The first step is getting our ADP data . There are a few options here . We personally like MyFantasyLeague.com ( that 's where the data that beat Berry above come from ) because it includes results from actual drafts ( a lot of ADP data comes from practice drafts , which is n't as helpful – we want our crowd to have a real investment in their picks ) and you can filter on things like league size and scoring system . So , as close to your draft as possible ( we want to be using the most up to date information available ) go to the MFL website .
Advertisement
Enter in your league parameters in the drop down boxes at the top . The important parameters to consider are :
Scoring System : Default is All Scoring Systems but choose to look at just leagues with either PPR Scoring Systems ( point per reception ) or Non-PPR Scoring Systems depending on your league rules . Most leagues on MyFantasyLeague.com use PPR scoring , so that will likely give us rankings that are n't as noisy , but enough leagues do Non-PPR scoring that that 's is okay to use too .
Start Date : This is important : restrict your analysis to the most recent available that 'll give you a big enough sample size ( more is better but anything over , say , 75ish will work ) . We 're constantly getting new information—Kendall Hunter is out for the season , LeSean McCoy is looking great in camp—that might be helpful to incorporate into player rankings . The crowd will adjust accordingly , but we need to make sure we 're using the most recent drafts .
Advertisement
League Size : Most leagues on MyFantasyLeague.com have 12 owners . That 's great news if you 're in a 12-person league yourself , but can mean that sample sizes get kind of small if you 're not . Luckily , this does n't matter as much . Just set this to 12 Franchise Leagues if you 're in a 12-person league ; otherwise do n't feel bad about leaving it on All League Sizes .
Now you 've got your cheatsheet . Either print it out by position , or for the time-crunched , select Non-IDP Positions in the position dropdown box and print out the whole thing at once .

During the Draft
As your draft progresses , your opponents will be making picks based on a mixture of personal opinion , 'expert ' rankings , and blind panic . They 'll often draft players earlier than their ADP , which—by definition—means you 'll be able to draft other players later than their ADP . This is how you find value .
In general , ADP works better in selecting players within a given position ( e.g . picking one RB over another ) rather than selecting players between positions ( e.g . picking some RB vs some other WR ) . The reasons for this are twofold :
First , ADP can change for certain positions depending on league parameters . For example , WRs will go higher in leagues that start three of them vs a league that starts two . Because our ADP does n't make a distinction between these types of leagues , the wisdom of crowd can get a little murky on inter-position comparisons .
Advertisement
Just as importantly , the value of a given position to you changes with the flow of the draft . If you 've already drafted Aaron Rodgers and Ben Roethlisberger , for example , it might not make sense to draft Phillip Rivers , even if they do have the best ADP of anyone left .
Bottom line : In general , decide on a position , then use ADP to select the best player at that position . Like everything , there are exceptions . You might want to consider drafting the highest player available ( regardless of position ) when exceptional value is available , your draft depth is relatively balanced across positions , or you 're relatively new to fantasy football and having some trouble deciding amongst positions on your own . ( If you are brand new to fantasy football , one addition to the `` decide on a position , draft the player with the highest ADP '' rule : do n't draft a Defense and K too early—in fact , it 's perfectly okay if these are your last two picks ) .
Finally , the wisdom of crowds is not meant to turn you into a fantasy robot . Drafting purely based on ADP is tough to beat consistently and requires very little preparation , but there 's room for independent thinking . You 're free to use this however you want , anything from a straight checklist to an anchor that keeps your draft generally on track .
Advertisement
Think a straight check-list is boring ? Maybe , but you would beat have Berry—a guy who by all accounts is very good at their job and spends thousands of hours each year preparing—more often than not over the past three years .
Even if you 're completely sold on ADP , there 's still room for some flexibility . Often , ADP 's are very close ( e.g . Giovani Bernard 's 17.81 and Montee Ball 's 17.91 ) . In that case , if you have a strong preference a player—even if they have a slightly worse ADP—then go for it ! Odds are the difference is n't statistically significant anyway , and that 's part of the fun of fantasy football .
After the Draft and Next Steps
The wisdom of crowds gives us the best initial guess at player rankings coming into the season . This assures us of an above average draft ; now we just have to keep the momentum rolling .
Advertisement
Things inevitably change once the season starts . Some players do better than expected , some worse . In short , observing actual games gives us data , and the results affect decisions about who to start , add , drop or trade for going forward . Unfortunately , that also means our ADP pre-draft rankings inevitably get out of date .
Ideally , leagues would have new drafts after every single week . That way we could update our weekly in-season rankings using the wisdom of crowds . Since this is n't likely to happen any time soon , let me offer a next best alternative .
Bayesian Fantasy Football is specifically designed for this very in-season problem [ ed . : their service is not free and requires a subscription fee ] . We start with an initial set of pre-season rankings ( based on ADP ) and update them as data ( game results ) trickles in . While in some sense this is what every fantasy player does , we formalize the process using Bayesian inference , which is branch of statistics concerned with updating beliefs using new data .

Although they can help if you find yourself a little lost as the season goes on , Bayesian based in-season rankings are not required to dominate your draft . As we 've seen , that part requires very little time and absolutely no money . In about five minutes , you can incorporate the wisdom of crowds and get a jump on everyone else in your league and most experts . Happy Drafting .

As Islamic terrorists launch attacks across the globe , Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal plans to call on Muslim leaders to publicly condemn these “ acts of barbarism , ” declaring : “ Let 's be honest here , Islam has a problem . ”
“ If Islam does not support what is happening in the name of Islam , then they need to stand up and stop it , ” Jindal says in prepared remarks released by their office ahead of their Monday speech in London . “ Many Islamic leaders argue that these are the acts of a radical few . ”
“ I will warn you in advance that I 'm going to say some things that are not politically correct , so brace yourselves , ” Jindal , a potential Republican candidate for president , will say at the Henry Jackson Society on Monday .
“ To be clear , I have no interest in defaming any religion , nor do I have any interest in assigning the maniacal acts of radical Islamists to millions of Muslims worldwide , ” Jindal says . “ I 'm interested only in dealing with reality and facts . ”
“ And the fact is that radical Islamists do not believe in freedom or common decency nor are they willing to accommodate them in any way and anywhere , ” Jindal says . “ We need to stop pretending otherwise . ”
The governor will say “ we are fools to pretend otherwise . ”
“ How many Muslims in this world agree with these radicals ? ” Jindal says . “ I have no idea , I hope it is a small minority . But it is clear that far too many do , and it is clear that they must be stopped . ”
Jindal will say that Muslim leaders need to emphasize that anyone who would commit “ acts of terror in the name of Islam is in fact not practicing Islam at all . ”
“ If they refuse to say this , then they are condoning these acts of barbarism , ” Jindal says . “ There is no middle ground . ”
In the speech , Jindal also takes aim at Hillary Clinton , the likely Democratic candidate for president in 2016 , referencing their recent remarks that America should empathize with its enemies ' perspectives .
“ Well , yes , understanding our enemies as a means of destroying them , I 'm all for that , ” Jindal will say . “ But empathizing with them as if perhaps we can find some common ground , I have no interest in that kind of mindless naiveté . ”
Says Jindal : “ Let me be blunt about this . I want America 's allies to trust us and respect us , and I want our enemies to fear us . Every day our enemies spend their time trying to avoid our justice is a day they are not plotting against us . And I fear that in recent years this has not been the case . ”
Jindal will also go on to attack the “ Left in America ” for discouraging assimilation when immigrants come to the United States .
“ There was once a time when it was taken for granted in America that people who came to our country were coming to America to be Americans , ” Jindal will say . “ But over time , a different philosophy has crept in , and that philosophy now dominates the thinking of the American Left , and perhaps even the mainstream of thinking in Europe .
“ This philosophy holds the view that it is wrong to expect assimilation , that assimilation is colonialist , assimilation is backward , and assimilation is in fact evidence of cultural bigotry and insensitivity .
“ They think it is wrong to expect that people who chose to immigrate to your country should be expected to endorse and abide by your laws .
“ They think it is unenlightened , discriminatory , and even racist to expect immigrants to endorse and assimilate into the culture in their new country .
“ This is complete rubbish . ”

Android gaming website Droid Gamers may be in a spot of trouble as a diligent Reddit user spotted some worrying changes under their new ownership . The user u/Stowaway—Throwaway first became concerned when they noticed that the site 's domain had recently been re-registered under the name “ Push Your App , ” a company name belonging to an app marketing firm . Push Your App advertises its own services thus : “ If you 're looking to advertise , get editorial content on leading sites or have experts look over and provide detailed reports and analysis of your app , then we 're the company to help . We also promise to beat any other price for the same service ! ” It 's easy to understand why this would raise concerns , as at this point it appeared the site was under the control of a company who 's sole aim is placing paid “ editorial ” content for apps .
This original thread attracted a quick response from an account attributed to the site 's original owner , Andrew Huff , claiming that the owners of Push Your App were “ personal friends ” who had agreed to “ temp hold ” the domain because “ I needed to move our domains hosted on GoDaddy from my personal account there to a different one while I make some changes. ” In a subsequent thread , this explanation was later shown to be false . This second thread from the same OP a few days later revealed even more shocking details about the site 's association with Push Your App . After sending an email to the site 's advertising department ( [ email protected ] ) masquerading as a developer with an app to promote , they received this response from Push Your App ,
As you can see , the response clearly offers paid advertising content including paid reviews , placed articles , full site takeover ( referring to when a game is featured on banner adds , in articles etc . forming the majority of visible content on the website ) and is directly referring to Droid Gamers as the outlet for the content . The thread generated a response from an account attributed to the site 's new owner u/droidgamersadmin . This response suggested that the site had been sold by the previous owner , that the previous owner had failed to pay staff for over a year , and that the OP was a former writer for the site . The response did confirm that Push Your App were now handling marketing content on the site :
It 's at this point that the argument becomes unclear , so we reached out to the parties involved to see if we could shed some light on the situation . Firstly , we were able to confirm beyond a reasonable doubt that the OP is not former writer Ryan Ballard as suggested by the site 's new owner . We contacted the OP directly and , while they wish to remain anonymous , they were able to confirm their identity as someone unrelated to the site either now or in the past . This calls into question the new owner 's comments , making the initial assertion seem like nothing more than an attempt to discredit the poster and deflect from the issue .
Secondly , sources close to the site confirmed that the ongoing pay dispute with the previous owner was correct and that the site had indeed changed ownership . Reports from the time that current writers had been locked out of the site were correct but this appears to have been due to a migration to new servers under the new ownership . The same source confirmed to us that , to the best of their knowledge , paid reviews and editorial content had not appeared on the site prior to the new ownership taking over .
We also reached out to the site 's new owners but they have so far declined to make any official comment on the matter . They did , however , post some succinct responses on the Reddit thread referenced above , outlining their position , which we 'll cover here . We must note at this point that the site 's ownership have not confirmed that Reddit user u/droidgamersadmin is an official account for the site but our source close to the site believes this to be the case and the posts certainly contain information that only someone with internal knowledge of the site could possess . Users immediately questioned the paid reviews and whether examples had appeared on the site which met with this response :
When the veracity of the claim that they would reject paid review requests for low quality games was challenged and the ethics of selling reviews and paid articles was called into question , the new owners justified it like this :
So by the site 's own assertion , they do n't sell advertising , Push Your App does , and any paid content would be labeled . In the subsequent response , the site is reliant on this revenue to keep the lights on . This does n't seem to add up . Looking at the home page of Droid Gamers right now , there is no content that is labeled as paid advertising . This seriously calls into question the site 's response . The suggestion that hidden paid content appeared on the site under the old ownership directly contradicts the information from our source . The fact that they were not open about the paid content until this email was exposed shows even the first line of their comment to be untrue .

There were 67 people shot and 11 killed over the long Independence Day weekend in Chicago . Of the 67 , eight were shot , with one killed , in a single Saturday evening attack in the West Side neighborhood of Lawndale .
The Chicago Tribune lists the details of the some of the gruesome shootings :
At Stroger [ Cook County Hospital ] were : a woman , 72 , with a wound to an ankle ; a woman , 41 , with a wound to their right thigh ; a man , 43 , with gunshot wounds to the leg and back ; a man , 45 , shot in the penis and right thigh ; and a man , 48 , shot in the leg and buttocks . At Mount Sinai were : a man , 31 , shot in the wrist , and a woman , 20 , shot in the right leg . Police described all the victims as having had their conditions stabilized .
Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy issued a press release in June boasting of the more than 2900 firearm seizures the department had made in 2013 :
“ We continue to achieve significant decreases in murders , shootings , and overall crime this year , yet there are too many illegal guns on our streets , ” said Superintendent McCarthy . “ The passage of significant legislation in Springfield last week requiring reporting the loss and theft of guns is an important step forward and there 's more work to be done to keep illegal weapons off our streets . ”
Despite the seizures , and technically lower overall crime statistics for the year , of which Mayor Rahm Emanuel and McCarthy consistently remind Chicagoans , the murder rate since early May is rivaling the same period for 2012 's year-long bloodbath in the city of Chicago .
For the 28 days leading up to this past Father 's Day weekend–another bloodbath itself , in which 46 were shot and 8 were killed , including one shot by a police officer–murder numbers matched 2012 exactly with 41 . Chicago Police data show that in the two weeks following , another 27 were gunned down and killed .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Chief executives of some of America 's largest retailers , including Target Corp ( TGT.N ) and Best Buy Co Inc ( BBY.N ) , are headed to Washington this week to make their case that a controversial tax on imports would raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses , according to people familiar with the plan .

The group of eight retail bosses , that also includes chief executives of Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) and Autozone Inc ( AZO.N ) , will meet on Wednesday with Kevin Brady , chairperson of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee , and with members of the Senate , four people said in recent days . Reuters could not confirm the full list of participants .
This is the first time well-known retail CEOs will descend on Washington as a group to try to make the case to kill the import tax proposal . Their input has more urgency as U.S. President Donald Trump is finalizing their own tax plan that they plan to unveil in the coming weeks .
It is not known if the group , including Target CEO Brian Cornell , Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly , GAP CEO Art Peck and Autozone CEO William Rhodes , will meet with Trump at the White House while in town , according to people familiar with ongoing discussions .
Brady and Speaker Paul Ryan are leading a House Republican push that would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent , exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports . Companies that rely heavily on imports , such as retailers , automakers and refiners say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax .
Asked for confirmation of the meeting , Brian Dodge , a spokesperson for the Retail Industry Leaders Association , told Reuters there was going to be a meeting this week but declined to provide further details .
The trade group is leading the industry 's effort to oppose House Republicans ' proposal for a border adjustability tax , running a coalition of more than 120 companies and trade organizations including Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc ( WBA.O ) .
Representatives for Target , Best Buy , Gap and AutoZone did not respond to requests for comment .
Trump has voiced some concern about the House tax proposal calling it “ too complicated. ” But the White House also said previously that a border tax on goods from Mexico is one option under review to pay for a wall along the nation 's southern border .
The prospect of a big import tax is also pitting some of the largest U.S. companies against one another . A group of major exporters including Boeing Co ( BA.N ) , General Electrics Co ( GE.N ) and Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) have formed their own coalition to support the import tax .
Retailers have become the most vocal opponents to the proposal , saying a 20 percent tax on imported goods would cause prices to increase for consumers and erase any profits the companies currently make . Nearly all of the nation 's clothing , shoes and electronics are imported into the United States , as well as foods that can not be grown domestically , like coffee and palm oil .
The largest U.S. electronics retailer , Best Buy , for example , has circulated a flyer to lawmakers , which cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company 's projected annual net income of $ 1 billion and turn it into a $ 2 billion loss .
On Rubies ( Part 1 of 4 )
Anonymous said :
I 'm not sure if you 've seen the newest episodes ( Hit the Diamond , in particular ) but I was curious on your thoughts about the Rubies , as well as any thoughts on Lapis Lazuli 's & Peridot 's character development thus far ?
This is probably going to be lengthy ( and I 'll have the other half of the ask in another post ) . So I 'm going to divide them into a series of posts with different aspects I want to discuss about the Rubies . With that said , I 'll link to the other posts as always when I 'm done .
What I find very interesting about the Rubies , is that we 're treated to Rubies across time . We have Rubies from before the war ( Deltoid and Opisthenar ) , from after the war ( Doc , Eyeball , Army , Leggy , Navy ) , and we have our Ruby , who 's been through both times and everything in between . As such , we have an idea how not only the Rubies , but also society has changed through time , particularly that of Homeworld .
Just a note : This series of posts will have some gem analysis and some gem placement analysis to supplement the usual character analysis .
1 . Origin and Function
We know that Rubies are soldiers and that they do n't rank very highly on the Homeworld hierarchy . Since Peridot spoke a little about Peridots and peridotite , I think there are some similarities between how the gemstones are made in the series and how they 're made in our universe .
Given this , some people have already talked about how rubies are made of corundum , which is in turn a transparent mineral made of aluminium oxide . What gives rubies their red colour is impurities in the mineral , namely chromium , which substitutes some of the aluminium ions .
One other thing about rubies is that they can be made cheaply in the laboratory through a process called flame-fusion synthesis . In this process , the solution I mentioned above is superheated and dripped . The solution then crystallises and forms the ruby .
I do n't want to dwell on these too much , because sapphires have close to the same creation processes , but with iron instead of chromium giving its colour . But I think they do offer an idea of how Homeworld is able to create these gems . I mentioned in my Gem Abilities post how Homeworld 's definition of rarity may not match ours . This is because Homeworld planets may have vastly different makeups from ours . Whichever compounds they are likely to find in abundance would be common to them . If this is the case , Rubies must be relatively easy for Homeworld to produce , and to minimise resources , something akin to the flame-fusion method is probably used .
This would fit in nicely with Rubies ' ability to superheat their bodies to the point of auto-igniting the air around them , creating fire . I feel that their pyrokinesis works differently in different atmospheres , but I stand by superheating as the fundamental ability that they have .
If this is the case , then they would be abundant enough to be common gems . I feel that they are n't incredibly high level even as soldiers . Above them rank the quartz gems , who are bigger and I 'm assuming more physically powerful . Additionally , quartz abilities , such as the spin-dash attack , can be taken as more versatile than the pyrokinetic powers in a war zone , where pyrokinesis is a little more unpredictable .
2 . Rubies have been socialised to behave the way they do
I say this because thus far , Rubies have been portrayed to us as Amethyst bluntly put it , “ Rubies are dumb. ” This is n't a function of their actually lacking the mental capacity , but rather Homeworld does n't train them to think the way we 've seen the other characters do . Being “ dumb ” the way it was described by the characters , would probably refer to the Rubies being more perceptible , knowing things about their potential enemies , and knowing their own forces enough to notice the impostor among them . I get that these things are rather necessary in battle , but I also think that Rubies are not often assigned to missions alone .
Our own Ruby is n't completely free of this , at times sweeping , characterisation . Many people portray them as the bumbling oaf of their relationship with Sapphire , claiming that she 's less able to keep calm and process the big picture .
In The Answer , we see that the Rubies are assigned as guards to a Sapphire . In Hit the Diamond , the Rubies are sent to retrieve the quartz soldier . In both cases , Homeworld expects that someone is going to take charge of these Rubies and tell them what to do . In these examples , they 're given one job at a time only . We do n't hear the Ruby Guards say “ I 'm going to protect Sapphire and then capture these rebels if I 'm given the opportunity ; ” we just hear them say “ I 'm going to punch them ! ” because that 's their job . They were told to protect the Sapphire from incoming threats .
In the same way , the Ruby Squad in HTD come in and do n't question the Earth practices of baseball . They were told to find Jasper at all costs . So ignore that this is a weird tradition , ignore that that human is purple ( if they were even briefed in the first place , as I 'll explain later ) . What we 're interpreting as a lack of intelligence can actually be severe tunnel vision .
I have a feeling that given their size and their abilities , Homeworld does n't think they can handle more difficult or more complicated missions . As such , Rubies always travel in groups , because Homeworld might think it increases their chances of success . Contrast this with Jasper 's Earth mission with Peridot and Lapis . Three gems , with only one having military experience coming to a former rogue planet . It 's possible Homeworld thinks that quartzes and other gems can handle situations better than Rubies can .
And all this shows that socialisation hugely impacts development and acquiring skill sets . Homeworld does n't assign them complicated missions . Homeworld does n't teach them how to problem-solve or assign them missions requiring more than brute strength . As a result , they do n't acquire those skills . They do n't pick up on smaller nuances that could help them do the mission more effectively . The reason Homeworld always sends more than one Ruby at a time is so that in the event a problem occurs , they can fuse , get really big , and crush something .
So to be a successful Ruby , this is what you have to do ; this is what your Homeworld looks for . Very subtly , it 's a message that tells Rubies their brawn is prized and that 's their contribution to their Homeworld . It 's the same kind of insidious expectations that tell us that if we 're tall we should play basketball and not something like join the chess team . As these Rubies ( or any other gems in their respective ranks ) meet others like them , they are socialised again to act like them , to fit in with their peers .
For me this grouping/squad system for lower ranking gems has a two-fold effect . First , it promotes a lot of groupthink and group mentality . If the Rubies feel they have somewhere to fit in by acting a certain way , it makes them less likely to change those ways . It 's difficult to be critical about something when it appears all your peers are cool with just punching things . Second , it 's for survival . They 're soldiers , and even in our universe soldiers are trained with their comrades so they get familiar with one another and are willing to help each other . It greatly increases their chances of survival .
This is utilitarian Homeworld . It wastes their resources to have gems just die all around them when these deaths could have been prevented . Although having more critical Rubies would be an asset on their missions , they 'd inadvertently created a class of soldiers who are n't , because they 'd been assigning Rubies on missions that do n't require it at the core .
3 . But there 's still some sort of merit system on Homeworld that allows some soldiers to get promoted
Doc 's entire presence oozes authority . They have the visor , something none of their squad members have ( I 'm just going to refer to them as a squad from now on ) . They stand on the ship and gives orders and directives . They look out for their squad members , such as pulling Leggy with them when they 're about to leave and to not leave them behind .
But Doc is a Ruby just like the others . She 's also a bit more critical , making sure to count their squad members and actually question Ruby 's motives when they say they ca n't search the barn . “ Why not ? ”
And I 've said this before , but I think that since Homeworld reached its technological boom , it 's done away with courts and monarchies and made its hierarchy more bureaucratic . We know Peridot has a supervisor ; we 've seen the relationship YD has with YP ( more boss-secretary than queen-handmaiden ) ; we are given hints to these processes , systems , paperwork , that make everything run back home .
One thing of note that Peridot said in Hit the Diamond , is this :
Peridot : I disobeyed a direct order from Yellow Diamond , and I called them a clod… to their face ! Pearl : Oh , honestly , you call everyone a clod . Peridot : Yes , but not everyone has command over all the armies of Homeworld waiting for the word to shatter me !
Source : SU Wiki
Because from what we 're led to believe , Homeworld is in the age where logic and reason are rule , with YD at the helm . It 's not just the military faction , because Peridot , a technician , is under YD as well . Utility is key , and the more skills you have , the more use you can be . Yellow Pearl is doing secretarial work now , has a voice ( a very vocal one ) , and makes faces , a sharp contrast from earlier notions of Pearl 's having to just stand there and look pretty that we saw in Blue Pearl .
So if a Ruby ( or any other gem ) managed to differentiate themselves from their peers in the right ways , in the ways Homeworld idealised , we see that 's rewarded as Doc is made squad leader . This speaks volumes of the shift that 's happened on Homeworld . It 's not as progressive as we 'd like , but there 's a change there .
For instance , Doc is still the squad leader of Rubies . I doubt she 'll have a chance to lead a group of , say , quartzes in their lifetime . But it goes back to the idea that completely sadistic and evil dystopian societies just do n't work in operationalisation . When you push people to their breaking points , you 're going to have a rebellion . But we see time and time again how loyal people are to their home , even after everything that 's happened to them , like Rose and Lapis .
I 'm starting to think that Homeworld tried really hard to create the ideal society , where each gem-type has a specific role and function . But that system stifles progress and development , because it limits what each gem can do and typecasts them into unchangeable roles . It prevents the exchange of ideas , building upon experiences . What Homeworld is doing is n't okay , but it 's starting to look more and more like they 're doing bad things with good intentions in mind for their people , and less like they hate their own people to begin with .
The next posts are going to be character analyses on the different Rubies we 've seen in the show . I 'll put a link to them below this post when it 's been finished and update the blog when all the posts are complete , so stay tuned !

What pregnancy did to our bodies : Six brave mothers reveal the toll having a baby has taken on their figures
Barely a week goes by without yet another celebrity flaunting their enviable bikini body just weeks after having a baby . But few real women manage to snap back into shape so soon after childbirth . Femail asked six brave mothers to reveal the toll pregnancy has taken on their figures .
HUGE STRETCH MARKS
Natalie Edmonds , 26 , is a holistic therapist from Weston-super-Mare , Somerset . They have an 18-month-old son , Elliott . They weigh 12st 3lb and is a size 14 . They say their stretch marks were the worst their midwife had ever seen .
Mark of a mum : Natalie loves their stretch marks
It was inevitable I 'd get stretch marks . My mother had them when they were expecting me and I 'd already developed them as my hips widened during puberty .
For the first three months of my pregnancy , I was so ill I threw up everything . But as the sickness went and I grew more tired I started comfort-eating sausage sandwiches and chocolate . The weight went on my thighs , breasts , face and , of course , stomach .
I noticed my first stretch mark at four months and after that a new one emerged virtually every week .
I told myself it did n't matter as long as they remained below my belly button , so I could hide them under trousers and skirts . But Elliott was three weeks overdue and as my bump grew bigger , they crept towards my chest .
Even my midwife at Southmead Hospital in Bristol was shocked . They said they were the worst stretch marks she 'd ever seen . I was angered by their rudeness but exasperated with my body nonetheless .
I lost the three stone I 'd put on within just three weeks of Elliott 's birth in November 2010 . I lost my appetite and was shocked by how quickly my weight plummeted .
My stomach had completely lost muscle definition . The sudden weight loss even gave me stretch marks on my breasts and arms .
I 'm still breastfeeding , so my body has n't completely settled . Aside from a few spinning classes , I do n't have the motivation to exercise . Being a mum takes up all my energy .
After having me , my mother , who 's a size 8 , spent decades dieting . They tell me I should do the same . But I do n't want to compete with them They say my stretch marks are horrible , but I think they 're a mark of what I 've been through .
It might sound strange but I 'm disappointed they 've faded to silver and are less visible . I felt like a tiger mum when they were bright red .
I split up with my partner Clemence , 39 , a psychiatric nurse , shortly after I fell pregnant . It 's not on my agenda to meet anyone else . I am generally happy with my body although I know my stomach will never look the same again .
SAGGY BUST
Aimee Marshall , 22 , is a hairdresser from Braintree , Essex . They have a nine-month-old daughter , Eadie . They weigh 9st and is a size 8-10 . Aimee was devastated by the way their breasts looked after giving birth .
Once pert : Amiee hates their saggy bust
Pre-pregnancy , I was a size 6 with pert 32E breasts . I was so proud of them . I showed them off in low-cut tops and was full of confidence .
I 'd only been with my boyfriend for eight weeks and was on the Pill when I found out I was expecting . I was shocked but soon grew excited . I only put on a stone and my bump did n't become obvious until I was six months pregnant .
That 's not to say I did n't look like a wreck . The beautiful blooming pregnancy body is a myth . Because of the hormones , I developed strange moles and psoriasis that spread down my forehead and cheeks .
Eadie was born by emergency C-section four weeks prematurely last August at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford . I had a condition called placenta abruption , in which my placenta developed a hole and Eadie 's heartbeat slowed .
They were rushed to the neo-natal unit and the midwives encouraged me to express milk for them I ended up with excruciating mastitis . Both breasts tripled in size and developed a greenish hue .
They were so painful and lumpy I could n't sleep . I 'd watch in floods of tears as the other new mums breastfed their babies . We left hospital five days later and I was given antibiotics . My breasts went back to a G-cup then six weeks later , when I stopped feeding Eadie , they started to shrink .
Although my bra size only went down to an F cup , the skin had stretched so much they looked like empty sacks — I was devastated .
It took three months for my stomach to go down and I am still self-conscious about the red C-section scar . I have n't lost the stone I put on but the only thing that really bothers me is my cleavage . It feels as if I 've lost part of my identity .
I went to see a surgeon last month about having my breasts lifted and implants inserted and I 'm saving up for the £5,600 cost .
It has affected my confidence . Eadie 's dad and I split up when I was six months pregnant and I 'm too embarrassed to even contemplate another physical relationship .
I have n't been put off having more children but wish I 'd been aware of the havoc it would cause my body . Mums-to-be should know that they will never look the same again .
LOST TWO STONE
Jessica Armstrong , 20 , is a singer from Sheffield . They have a three-month-old daughter , Nevaya . They weigh 11st 7lb and is a size 12 . They lost two stone during their pregnancy .
Changed ways : Jessica 's slimmer than before having a baby because they wanted to eat healthily for the sake of their child
Before I became a mother , I had lumps and bumps on my hips , stomach and bottom . I weighed 13st 7lb and was a size 16 , but for many years I was n't bothered enough by my size to sacrifice my beloved takeaways .
Then , exactly three days after I 'd actually resolved to do something about my weight and started the Dukan diet , I discovered I was pregnant . I 'd been with my partner for three years and we were delighted .
Suddenly , my desire for junk food disappeared . The only foods I craved were ones it was n't safe to eat because of the increased risk of food poisoning — prawns and smoked salmon were what I wanted most , but obviously I could n't eat them . So , after the first trimester I 'd lost a stone .
My appetite never returned and I lost two stone in total . It was so different to how I 'd anticipated pregnancy would be that I kept going back to my GP . But they told me it was no cause for concern .
Immediately after Nevaya was born this February at Chesterfield Hospital , Derbyshire , I was a size 14 and could see my collarbone for the first time . After two weeks , I shrunk to a size 12 and had to buy a whole new wardrobe .
The change in my body was quite disconcerting . My breasts swelled from a D to an E cup as I breastfed and for the first time in my life , I was slim with a large cleavage . I 'm making a conscious effort to eat healthily so Navaya receives the right nutrients , so it 's perhaps not surprising that I 've kept the weight off .
I know I 'm lucky . But it 's still been a bit of a shock to change shape so dramatically .
BIG THIGHS AND CELLULITE
Natalia Russell , 37 , is a receptionist from Tunbridge Wells , Kent . They have a 15-month-old son , Rian , is a size 10–12 and weighs 8st 7lb . Them legs have got bigger and she 's developed cellulite .
Thigh 's the limit : Natalia dislikes their wobbly thighs
Looking back at my body pre-pregnancy I think I was too thin , but my legs were much better than they are today . I weighed 8st , was a size 8 and went to the gym twice a week .
Both myself and my partner Mark , 29 , a financial supervisor , were thrilled when I fell pregnant , even though I was sick every morning for the first trimester .
I put on two-and-a-half stone with most of the weight going on my bottom and my legs . I accepted it as a part of being pregnant .
Rian was born last February at Pembury Hospital in Tunbridge Wells . I did n't feel the immediate bond I 'd hoped for and for a few days afterwards I could n't stop crying . My stomach looked like jelly .
As it started to go down , my legs looked bigger in comparison . But I vowed to enjoy spending time with Rian rather than put pressure on myself to go to the gym and lose weight .
Being tired makes me eat more , as did breastfeed . My appetite is bigger than it was pre-pregnancy . I need the energy to look after Rian and I think my stomach has probably stretched and got used to needing more food .
I 've also developed cellulite . I bought a skin brush and expensive creams , but they have n't made any difference .
In the end it was six months before I was back in size 12 jeans . I 'm still 7lb heavier than I was , but do n't think I need to lose any more weight.I 'd love my legs to be more toned . They are bigger and wobblier . But I do n't have time to go to the gym .
My tummy is also wobbly , whereas before it was naturally flat . If I 'm not too exhausted , I do 30 sit-ups before I go to bed . I wear trousers more than skirts these days to cover my legs .
There 's not much opportunity for looking glamorous , but I 'm proud of my body . As Mark says if I 'm feeling low , my body may be bigger than it used to be , but it 's given us our son .
WOBBLY TUMMY
Rachel Barker , 30 , is a full-time mum from Colchester , Essex . They have three children , Kaden , five , Mason , three and Deacon , one . Rachel weighs 10st and is size 12–14 . They say three births , including two C-sections , have taken their toll on their stomach .
Baby weight : Rachel loathes their 'jelly belly '
I 've lost a lot of confidence in the way I look since became a mother . It did n't happen straight away . After Kaden was born in June 2006 , I ended up a stone heavier . But during my second pregnancy , I craved cakes and biscuits and put on two stone . I loved the excuse pregnancy gave me not to worry about my weight .
When I went into labour with Mason they were in breech position so I had to have an elective Caesarean section . I was upset as I 'd wanted another natural birth .
Afterwards , I was confined to bed for four days . I was shocked by the four-inch scar just below the top of my knicker line . I 'd given birth to Kaden and Mason in a hospital in Alicante , Spain , as my husband Kevin , who is an engineer , and I were living there at the time .
I 'm not convinced the surgeon did a good job . The skin around the scar was purple and bruised . It was painful to shower . I could n't pick up my children for the first week and could n't do much else for several weeks after that . My immobility made it harder to lose weight .
Even after a year , I struggled to lose the final half stone and get back into my size 12 jeans . I could n't bring myself to throw them out , so they stayed at the back of my wardrobe , upsetting me .
My third pregnancy was even harder . I craved crisps as well as sweet food . I still only put on two stone , but felt bigger , as if the cumulative effect of three pregnancies had taken their toll on my body .
Five months in , I discovered I had a complication called anti-E , which meant antibodies in my blood were attacking that of my unborn child . It increased the risks of a natural birth , so I had to have another C-section .
We 'd moved back to Britain in December 2009 and Deacon was born in Southend Hospital in Essex last May . This time the incision — made in the same place — was neater and less painful .
But my scar is still red and I 've got a massive flabby tummy . The tops of my legs are fatter and my bottom is bigger .
The only body parts I am happy with are my 32D breasts .
I 'm a stone heavier than I was before I became a mum . I feel more womanly because of what my body has done , but less attractive .
Kevin says I 'm still beautiful but it has affected our marriage — I always wear pyjamas in bed . I 've accepted I 'm going to remain this size and I 'm learning to live with it .
HARDLY ANY CHANGE
Aoife Johns , 27 , is a stay-at-home mum from Harrow , London . Them son Cian is 22 months old . They weigh 8st 9lb and is a size 8-10 . They thought the changes to their body after childbirth would be far worse than they were .
Pleasantly surprised : Aoife has n't changed a bit
I was pleasantly surprised by my post-pregnancy body . I 've never liked my wobbly tummy and worried that after I gave birth the skin on my stomach would hang down round my ankles , but although it is a bit loose it does n't bother me .
I carried on with my normal diet and excitedly awaited my bump . I used to stand in front of the mirror pushing my tummy out and willing it to happen .
Out of fear of something going wrong , my boyfriend of four years , Ted , 27 , a builder , and I did n't tell anyone we were having a baby until I was six months pregnant . I hid under baggy clothes and nobody noticed .
I put on two stone in total . Cian was born in Northwick Park Hospital in July 2010 . Shortly after they arrived , I had a shower and looked in the hospital mirror . I was shocked by my wrinkly stomach but I 'd expected to look far worse .
After labour , I developed sciatica , caused by a trapped nerve . It was more painful than the labour itself . I could barely pick Cian up and felt really down . My doctor told me I had post-natal depression at my six-week check-up but I think I was just overwhelmed . Ted was endlessly supportive .
Being fit enough to go for walks with Cian after eight weeks was a huge boost but I did n't get back to my pre-pregnancy weight until they were six months .
I realised I 'd done it as I managed to pull on a favourite red dress for Cian 's Christening . It was a brilliant feeling and all the better knowing I 'd done it by just eating sensibly .
I do yoga once a week , walk three miles every other day and have just joined a jogging club .
I do n't have much muscle tone and I 'm not going to be flashing much flesh in the near future . But all in all , I do n't think I look much different .
Chandigarh : Self-styled 'godman ' Rampal , arrested from their Satlok ashram in Barwala , Haryana was sent to judicial custody till November 28 by Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday .
When the division bench asked Rampal as to why they did n't surrender before police , the sect leader replied that they were held captive in their ashram .
Speaking to the media , Rampal 's counsel SK Garg said the sect leader was held in captivity , which is why they could n't appear before the court , adding that their client was rescued by Haryana police .
Garg further said that Rampal is a law abiding citizen and respects judiciary .
The HC bench asked the Haryana government to file a report in connection with the police operation at Rampal 's ashram in Barwala .
The Punjab and Haryana High Court , while hearing arguments in the Rampal case directed the governments of both the states to prepare a comprehensive report on all deras running inside their borders and file the same before it at the next hearing on November 28 .
Earlier in the day , the court cancelled the bail granted to controversial sect leader Rampal in a 2006 murder case .
The division bench of the HC cancelled the bail which was granted to Rampal in April 2008 .
Earlier , while being taken from hospital to police station today morning Rampal said that all allegations against them are false . They also denied keeping anyone hostage while police was trying to enter their Satlok ashram premises .
When asked whether they were a godman or a conman , Rampal maintained silence .
The Haryana Police placed heavy security arrangements outside the HC premises to keep followers of the self-styled godman at bay and to ensure that they do not break the law here .
Rampal was brought to Panchkula town , adjoining Chandigarh early Thursday and was medically examined .
The controversial sect , who has been charged under under Sections 121 ( waging , or attempting to wage war , or abetting waging of war , against the Government of India , 121A ( conspiring to commit certain offences against the state ) and 122 ( Collecting arms etc . With the intention of waging war against the Govt of India ) , was taken to hospital after they complained of high blood pressure .
Other than the above mentioned cases the controversial 63-year-old baba has been charged with attempt to murder , rioting and illegal detention .
`` We have examined them and their condition , including their blood pressure , is stable , '' BK Bansal , a doctor at Panchkula 's Sector 6 General Hospital , told media .
Rampal was arrested from their ashram , ending an over two-week tense standoff between their supporters and the police after close to 15,000 of their followers were evacuated from the sprawling premises .
DGP SN Vashisht said that Rampal had been taken into custody following an operation which was `` very tough '' since the forces had to deal with a hostile army of their commandos .
Police said Rampal was arrested around 2120 hours and whisked them away in an ambulance .
The media , present in large numbers , was asked to clear the way for the ambulances to enter the ashram , police said .
On a day of high drama , Rampal stuck to their defiant stand of not surrendering despite repeated announcements by the police asking them to do so .
Simultanerously , many followers including women with children stuck inside trooped out , many of them complaining that they were forcibly kept inside the ashram with its gates kept locked .
Police said 70 supporters of the Rampal , most of them their 'private commandos ' , who indulged in violence yesterday , were arrested and produced before the local court which sent them to judicial custody till December 3 .
Those arrested , include son of Rampal and chief volunteer Purushottam Dass , a cousin of the 'godman ' .
The area around the ashram resembled a battlefield as sect supporters resisted police action .
Sect followers fired at police , lobbed petrol bombs and acid pouches , besides hurling stones and bricks outside the ashram , clearly indicating that the sect was well prepared to resist the security forces .
The sect leader has been avoiding arrest and failed to appear before the Punjab and Haryana high court although non-bailable warrants were issued against them Nov 5 .
Rampal 's supporters had indulged in vandalism in a court in Hisar in July when they were going there in connection with a 2006 murder case .
The high court took suo motu notice of the incident and had summoned Rampal .

California lawmakers passed a $ 156.4 billion budget plan on Sunday that includes funding for a controversial high-speed rail project and preschool education for low-income children .
The vote , which came in ahead of the state 's constitutional deadline by less than six hours , followed months of political wrangling among Democrats seeking to restore spending on social programs cut during the recession . In the end the Assembly approved the budget 55-24 and it received a 25-11 vote in the Senate .
Gov . Jerry Brown called the spending plan a `` solid and sustainable budget that pays down debt , brings stability to the teachers ' pension system and builds at long last a reliable Rainy Day Fund , '' in a statement on Friday . They praised the legislators for crafting `` a solid and sustainable budget '' barely bigger than the $ 156.2 billion they had proposed in May .
They have until July 1 to sign the budget into law . Last year Brown used their line-item veto to kill some measures .
In the budget , Brown 's high-speed rail project , a $ 68 billion effort opposed by Republicans , will receive $ 250 million in funding from the state 's cap-and-trade program . The state collects a fee after polluters buy and sell their rights to emit carbon into the air .
As part of a compromise with Brown , lawmakers negotiated additional commitments for cap-and-trade funds , including money for affordable housing , mass transit and clean energy projects .
Other compromises included an expansion of public pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds .
Lawmakers also plan to include a requirement that $ 1 billion of education funds be used for specific purposes . They include implementing national Common Core curriculum standards , vocational education and assistance for school districts with a high percentage of disadvantaged students , said Assembly member Nancy Skinner , a Berkeley Democrat .
The budget also takes steps to address the shortfall in the teacher pension fund by increasing contributions from the state , schools and school employees .
Lawmakers had an incentive to pass the budget by the deadline . For each day they are late , lawmakers do n't get paid .

Democrats and liberals are incensed that Senate Republicans are aiming to vote on an Obamacare replacement package prior to the July 4th recess . They argue that the process thus far has been exceedingly opaque , with a small working group of Senators crafting legislation behind closed doors , with the contents of the new bill shrouded in mystery . GOP leadership is reportedly planning to bring the resulting product to the floor for a vote without any substantive mark-up process in committee , as would be expected under regular order . This is a strikingly closed and insular method of rolling out a proposed law that would impact one-sixth of the US economy , critics lament . They have a point .
During the Obamacare passage saga , which spanned nine months over two calendar years , various iterations of the legislation snaked through committees and negotiations on both ends of Capitol Hill . Eventually , each Democrat-controlled chamber of Congress passed their own versions of healthcare reform , with the House finally agreeing to the Senate-passed bill -- followed by a very unusual move in which both chambers immediately made changes to the new law using a budgetary maneuver known as `` reconciliation . '' The overall bill was unpopular with the public , yet Democrats took advantage of their large majorities ( including , for months , a 60-vote , filibuster-proof Senate advantage ) to scrape together the requisite votes to muscle through final passage .
By comparison , if Republicans do in fact hold a vote on a replacement bill by the end of next week , they will have proceeded at warp speed . I can appreciate Mitch McConnell and company wanting to hash out their differences in private , denying opponents the opportunity to exploit internal disagreements or latch onto provisions that may or may not even make it into the final legislative language -- especially given how dishonest many of them have been about the House-passed bill . Plus , unlike Harry Reid in 2009 and 2010 , McConnell has very little margin for error when it comes to arriving at 50-plus-one votes . Better to get important ducks in a row before the chaos begins . Understandable .
Also , some of the attacks against the GOP-led process are overblown : The bill will not simply be voted upon with no warning , no debate , and no amendments . In fact , because Republicans plan to turn Senate Democrats ' Obamacare move against them in order to avoid the 60-vote threshold , reconciliation rules require the consideration of unlimited germane amendments . So a big , loud , protracted , emotional debate is coming . It 's nevertheless true that this whole episode could play out on an extremely compressed timetable , raising legitimate questions about whether this is how any legislation -- let alone highly consequential legislation -- ought to be introduced and adopted . All that being said , it 's a bit much to watch members of the media and Democratic politicians hold up the Obamacare passage journey as some paragon of transparency and good governance . A few reality checks :
( 1 ) Democrats marketed Obamacare with several gargantuan lies , the biggest of which is advertised in their own preferred shorthand for the law : The `` Affordable '' Care Act . Premiums and out-of-pocket costs have soared under Obamacare , and are getting worse . Team Obama and their allies also issued unequivocal promises that any consumer who was satisfied with their or their existing arrangements could keep what they liked . This ended up being tagged as left-leaning Politifact 's 'lie of the year ' once implementation exposed the egregious falsehood , which betrayed millions of Americans . Other vows and assurances on cost curves , access to care , reduced `` uncompensated care , '' and the price tag of Obamacare 's vast expansion of already-struggling Medicaid have similarly gone down the tubes .
( 2 ) In order to nail down the votes they needed , Democratic leaders and the White House handed out a string of legislative goodies ( and bogus promises ) to recalcitrant Democrats , from the `` Cornhusker Kickback '' to the `` Louisiana Purchase '' to `` Gatorade . '' Republicans objected to these machinations , calling them secretive and ethically-suspect . Some of those tweets and video clips are being used against them today , some representing pretty clean political hits . But highlighting those complaints is a double-edged sword for the Left ; yes , it underscores GOP opportunism and hypocrisy , but it also reminds people that Democrats did use a litany of shady tactics of their own in dragging Obamacare across the finish line without a single Republican vote .
( 3 ) In the clip below , conservative CNN contributor Mary Katharine Ham reminds the journalists on an Inside Politics panel that a big reason Republicans can use the accelerated , filibuster-evading `` reconciliation '' gambit to uproot much of the failing existing law is that Democrats laid the groundwork for them to do so back in March of 2010 :
Recall that Democrats chose not to ping the legislation back and forth any further -- or go to a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate bills -- because by that point , they 'd lost their filibuster-proof majority . In dramatic fashion . The people of Massachusetts elected a Republican , Scott Brown , to replace Ted Kennedy in the US Senate , expressly to kill the bill . Rather than heed the people 's abundantly clear will after that political lightning bolt of a wake-up call , Democrats turned to reconciliation to bypass the voter-imposed obstacle Brown embodied . A few months later , the American people made their point even more loudly , sending an astounding 63 House Democrats into early retirement . Democrats reacted to this , and subsequent unmistakable rebukes by hubristically doubling-down in their support for an imploding law , shamelessly blaming others and blindly insisting that Obamacare is working . It 's not , and its deterioration continues apace . The latest :
Iowa 's last major ObamaCare insurer weighs exit , requests 43 % premium hike https : //t.co/F5wSnMY6WD — FOX Business ( @ FoxBusiness ) June 20 , 2017
Republicans may indeed face a backlash of their own for jamming through an unpopular healthcare bill after relatively little public scrutiny ( although Senate passage would not conclude the process ; a treacherous path would still stretch ahead in the House ) . If they implement a law that does not improve people 's lives , or makes things worse , they 'll risk an Obamacare-style beating at the polls . But forgive me for refusing to accept lectures on proper procedure and best practices from the very people who lied , cajoled , and arm-twisted us into Obamacare , and still defend their disastrous handiwork to this very day .
Gov . Phil Scott has signed an executive order that creates a special marijuana advisory commission to focus on legalization issues .
After House Republicans blocked a legalization bill at the end of the legislative session , Scott said that they would create a commission through an executive order .
The order creates a 13-person panel that will study highway safety concerns , education and prevention issues , and how the state could tax and regulate the sale of pot .
Rebecca Kelley , the governor 's communication director , says Scott is not philosophically opposed to legalizing marijuana but wants to learn from the experience of other states , particularly in the area of highway safety .
`` That we 're looking at research data , and that we 're laying a framework , '' Kelley explains , `` to alleviate any concerns or any issues that other states have faced so that we can address them more proactively before we move forward on legalization . ''
The commission will have bipartisan leadership . Scott has named former Vermont Democratic Party chairperson Jake Perkinson and former Republican House member Tom Little to serve as co-chairpeople of the panel .
Little was the chairperson of the House Judiciary committee in 2000 when lawmakers passed the Civil Unions law . They say the issue of driver impairment will be a top priority .
`` There are considerable challenges with highway safety enforcement along the lines that we do with other drugs and with alcohol for marijuana , ” Little explained .
Some states that have legalized marijuana have a full regulatory system for the sale and taxation of pot , while others have simply legalized the possession of an ounce or two with no state oversight . Little says the commission will study the pros and cons of each approach .
Because the sale and possession of marijuana is illegal under federal law , states that regulate and tax marijuana often have to rely on a cash based system .
Little says this is another issue for the commission to look at .
`` There 's a use of alternative currencies , Bitcoin and other things like that , ” says Little , “ so that it is n't necessarily a cash basis entirely . ''
The commission is scheduled to issue its final report in December 2018 . It 's a timetable that will allow the 2019 Legislature to debate a legalization bill .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China 's Defence Ministry said on Friday people should n't read too much into a state media broadcast of live-fire military and landing drills , just days after a landslide election win by an independence-leaning opposition party in Taiwan .
Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) Chairperson and presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen waves as they arrive at the headquarters of DPP , following the DPP 's victory in Saturday 's presidential and parliamentary elections , in Taipei , January 18 , 2016 . REUTERS/Stringer
The self-ruled island expressed serious concern on Thursday over the mainland 's broadcast . Its defence ministry confirmed China recently carried out “ winter exercises ” , but said that the pictures in the video were archive clips spliced together of drills conducted in 2015 .
China considers Taiwan a wayward province , to be brought under its control by force if necessary . Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after the Chinese civil war .
“ The relevant media report is a summary of training manoeuvres organised last year by troops . There is no need to over-interpret them , ” China 's Defence Ministry said in a two-sentence statement faxed to Reuters .
Late on Wednesday , Chinese state television said the 31st Group Army , based in China 's southeastern city of Xiamen , opposite Taiwan , had carried out the drills in “ recent days ” , but it did not give an exact location .
The channel broadcast images of amphibious armoured vehicles ploughing through the sea towards a landing site , helicopters firing missiles at shore locations and soldiers parachuting down from helicopters .
The report made no direct mention of the Taiwan election , but a Taiwanese military official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said the broadcast may be “ psychological warfare ” warning the new Taiwan government to tread carefully .
Since Saturday 's landslide win by Tsai Ing-wen and their Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan 's presidential and parliamentary elections , China has warned against any moves towards independence and said it will defend the country 's sovereignty .
The United States has expressed concerns about the danger of worsening China-Taiwan ties , at a time when China 's navy is increasingly flexing its muscles in the South China and East China Seas and expanding territorial claims .
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken met the mainland 's Taiwan Affairs Office Minister , Zhang Zhijun , in Beijing on Thursday and “ reiterated the United States ' abiding interest in continued cross-Strait peace and stability‎ ” , the State Department said in an email .
Taiwan 's military has warned that China has practised attacks on targets modelled on places in Taiwan . Taiwan also estimates China aims hundreds of missiles at the island .

Felipe Calderon : document to give Argentina `` unanimous support '' Latin American and Caribbean leaders have backed Argentina 's claim over the Falklands , Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has said . At a regional summit in Cancun , Mexico , a document has reportedly been drafted giving Argentina unanimous support . It comes a day after a British oil company began drilling for oil off the islands , a move Argentina objected to . The UK 's defence minister said the government would take whatever steps necessary to protect the Falklands . Argentina and Britain went to war over the South Atlantic islands in 1982 , after Buenos Aires invaded the archipelago . The conflict ended with UK forces wresting back control of the islands , held by Britain since 1833 . Please turn on JavaScript . Media requires JavaScript to play . No official statement has been made in Cancun , but Mexican President Felipe Calderon reportedly said a document had been drawn up offering Buenos Aires full support in its territorial dispute with London . The Argentine president accused the British government of ignoring international law by allowing a British oil exploration company to begin drilling near the islands . They said : `` I think the important thing is that we have achieved very strong support , something that legitimates our claims fundamentally against the new petroleum activity . '' The BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Cancun says that any broad agreement at the summit could put more pressure on the British government in what has become an escalating diplomatic row . 'Return the Malvinas ' Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez reiterated their support for Argentina . The Ocean Guardian is in Falkland Islands waters `` We demand , and I think all of us should do the same , the withdrawal of the submarine platform , and that the English government ... give that land back , '' they said . Before leaving for the summit , Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega called for `` Britain to return the territory of the Malvinas to its real owners - to return it to Argentina '' on Venezuelan Telesur television . Leaders at the summit , between the Rio Group and the Caribbean Community ( Caricom ) , have also discussed plans for a new pan-American alliance which would exclude Canada and the United States . The new grouping would serve as an alternative to the Organisation of American States , the main forum for regional affairs in the past 50 years . The British-contracted rig Ocean Guardian began drilling 100km ( 62 miles ) north of the Falklands on Monday , despite fierce opposition from Argentina . HAVE YOUR SAY Argentina should concentrate on addressing far more important issues within their own country SG , Guildford Desire Petroleum , which is overseeing the operation , said drilling had started on the Liz 14/19-A exploration well at 1415 GMT . Argentina claims sovereignty over what it calls the Islas Malvinas and has imposed shipping restrictions . But UK Defence Minister Bill Rammell said the government had a `` legitimate right '' to build an oil industry in its waters . Mr Rammell said the UK would take `` whatever steps necessary '' to protect the islands and that it had made Argentina `` aware of that '' . Argentina has ruled out military action and is trying to pressure Britain into negotiations on sovereignty . During the seven-week war in 1982 over the Falklands , 649 Argentine and 255 British service personnel were killed . Last year Argentina submitted a claim to the United Nations for a vast expanse of ocean , based on research into the extent of the continental shelf , stretching to the Antarctic and including the island chains governed by the UK . It is due to raise the issue at the UN later this week .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday that one of the world 's richest men and owner of a major brewery in the South American country , Lorenzo Mendoza , was planning a U.S.-backed presidential run .
Chavez , an avowed foe of U.S. ‘ imperialism , ' did not provide evidence to back the claim that the owner of Empresas Polar had political ambitions , saying only that the billionaire should think carefully before jumping into politics because the government controlled grain supplies .
“ Lorenzo Mendoza wants to be president , and the Yankees are guiding him , ” they said . “ Polar depends on whether or not I sell it corn . ”
In recent weeks , Chavez has frequently warned the tycoon that they could nationalize the brewer and food maker in their economic war on the “ bourgeoise. ” They have already nationalized dozens of companies , including multibillion dollar oil projects .
“ Careful Mendoza , they said on Sunday , “ You 'll end up with nothing . ”
The attacks on Mendoza and what Chavez calls Venezuela 's “ parasitic bourgeoise ” seem to have the goal of rallying supporters against the opposition in the lead up legislative elections in September .
Mendoza , listed along with their family at number 125 on the Forbes Magazine world rich list , is a well-known public figure whose company is a central part of Venezuela culture , providing the nation 's favourite beer and the most popular brand of flour to make corn ‘ arepa ' patties , a staple food .
Polar was founded in 1941 by Mendoza 's grandfather .
The socialist president who has been in office for over 11 years is likely to run again in the next leadership elections in 2012 . The elections for legislators in September are seen as an important test of support for opposition parties , who are running unity candidates but have no clear leader going forward .
Chavez has already nationalized some warehouses belonging to Polar and frequently threatens to take over more of the oil exporting country 's main private employer . Many Polar workers oppose a government take-over and analysts think it would be a mistake for Chavez to tackle the company .
On Saturday , they said they were considering raising taxes on beer and cigarettes , and warned Mendoza that they would not tolerate Polar trucks selling crates of beer in poor neighbourhoods outside of licensed hours .
Nationalizing Polar would be an unpopular move , but that does not mean Chavez will not do it . In 2007 , they refused to renew a broadcasting licence for the nation 's most popular TV station , despite opposition from their own supporters .
CAPE TOWN , South Africa — Portugal put on the most dominant performance of the World Cup , routing North Korea 7-0 on Monday and eliminating the Asian nation from the tournament .
Simao Sabrosa , Hugo Almeida and Tiago scored over an eight-minute span in the second half , after Raul Meireles ' 29th-minute goal gave Portugal the lead . Substitute Liedson added another in the 81st .
( SCROLL DOWN FOR PHOTOS FROM THE MATCH )
Cristiano Ronaldo ended their goalless streak the 87th minute , and Tiago added their second goal two minutes later . Ronaldo had not scored for their nation in a non-friendly match since the 2008 European Championship .
The win moves Portugal into second place in Group G with four points , two behind Brazil . The Ivory Coast has one point , and North Korea ca n't advance in the tournament after two straight losses .
`` This is a great result for us , '' Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz said . `` We have to continue now . ''
North Korean state television aired live coverage of the Portugal match , in what was believed to be a first for a North Korean soccer game taking place abroad .
It was bad timing .
North Korea had early chances , but trouble began when Meireles latched on to a clever pass by Tiago and gave Portugal its first goal of the tournament . The score seemed to deflate the Koreans , while the Portuguese finally began to show some of the Latin flair that has made them an outside favorite to win their first championship .
`` Tactically speaking , we fell apart and we could n't block their attacks , '' North Korea coach Kim Jong Hun said . `` It was my fault for not playing the right strategy and that is why we conceded a lot of goals . ''
Meireles assisted on Simao 's goal in the 53rd minute , which went through the legs of North Korea goalkeeper Ri Myong Guk . Almeida scored three minutes later from a powerful header , and Tiago knocked home a pass from Ronaldo in the 60th .
Liedson scored off a defensive error , before Ronaldo ended a 16-month goal drought for their country with a simple finish after the ball fell to him .
`` It was important to score goals today , '' Tiago said .
Played in a steady downpour , the wet field at Green Point Stadium caused errant passes as many players lost their footing .
North Korea named the same lineup as the one that impressed in a 2-1 loss to Brazil , while Queiroz made four changes from the team that was held to 0-0 draw by the Ivory Coast .
Tiago replaced the injured Deco in midfield , with Almeida and Simao joining Ronaldo up front . Miguel Brito was chosen ahead of Paulo Ferreira at right back .
How to do linguistics outreach - Resource roundup
Here 's a collection of linguistics outreach resources and activities that I 'm aware of , for the benefit of linguists who want to do more outreach and do n't know how to get started . You may be able to join in an existing effort , or it may inspire you to start your own , although probably do n't try to do all of these as one person ! If you 're a non-linguist who wants more linguistics in your life , these may give you idea of things to engage with .
Why try to engage the public as linguists ?
A rising tide of more public awareness about linguistics has a few obvious benefits : people know not to ask you how many languages you know , there 's less prescriptivism , people understand some of the basics of the field so it 's easier to explain the details of your research . ( As David Pesetsky discusses in their 2013 LSA plenary - start around slide 71 . )
But public engagement can also directly benefit your department or research : it can lead to more people choosing to take linguistics courses or enroll in linguistics majors ( especially if you engage local/regional high school students , since many people have an enthusiasm for language without knowing that linguistics exists and still stumble into linguistics at random ) . Granting agencies , governments , and university administrations often want to see demonstrable public impact or knowledge dissemination resulting from research funds .
Engagement also benefits the linguists doing it : practice explaining things to general public helps you articulate what your research is and why it matters to scholars in other fields , administrators , or granting agencies . Having a low-stakes way of collaborating with linguists/other scholars helps you learn more about each other 's fields and figure out whether you 'd want to collaborate on a higher stakes research project ( see this post on Language Science for Everyone ) . Many methods of doing outreach also develop skills that can lead to a job outside academia or provide supplementary income for grad students while in school .
Writing & Online
One way of engaging is to write an explainer article or an op-ed , or be willing to be interviewed for an article by someone else , whether for a general publication or one specifically focussed on pop linguistics , such as Unravel , Babel , or Schwa Fire . For more effort and investment of resources , there are pop linguistics books , videos on youtube or elsewhere , and podcasts .
For more bite-sized ideas , you can start a blog or contribute to an existing blog , add citations or missing information to linguistics-related Wikipedia articles , or engage people on social media , such as by livetweeting conferences on Twitter or answering questions on Quora , Reddit , or Stack Exchange .
More details can also be found in the popularizing linguistics via online media session at the LSA 2015 that I participated in .
In person
There are a variety of in-person events , which you may be able to participate in if they 're near you or use as inspiration for getting linguistics into a general local event or starting your own from scratch .
Several of these options were also part of a panel at the 2015 LSA annual meeting .
Schools
Does anyone know of any activities or resources I 've missed ? This list is rather American-centric at the moment , since I 've gotten a lot of the information from talks at the LSA , but I 'm very happy to include things from other countries if anyone has links !
Sears , like most of its competitors in the big box retail industry , is struggling to maintain its current status in a shrinking market . This is not a controversial statement ; parent company Sears Holdings ' stock has yet to reverse its gradual decline , which is one reason why it has made so many changes to its agency roster in recent years .
We hear that Sears Holdings took an unusual step when negotiating its current contract with Havas , which emerged from the extended Kmart creative review victorious last September as Publicis New York won lead duties on the Sears brand .
According to our sources , part of that contract required the Havas organization to share its entire employee database with the client .
This would be part of Sears ' focused Big Data efforts , which began several years ago before hitting a speed bump in 2014 with news of a breach at Kmart . The company has made data and targeting a big part of its ongoing recovery–see , for example , this 2012 InformationWeek article on efforts to improve its IT operations and this Fortune piece from last summer on the Sears repairman as a high-value “ data vehicle . ”
Sources tell us that the purpose of the unusual agreement between agency and client was to expand the latter 's existing consumer database while also monitoring whether Havas employees might happen to be shopping at Sears or Kmart .
Both Sears and Havas declined to confirm this . From a client spokesperson :
“ Sears Holdings values its agency relationships and appreciates the work they do to help us reach our members . Like any advertiser , we do not discuss the terms of our vendor agreements publicly or respond to industry conjecture . ”
The agency made a similar “ no comment ” statement , noting that “ it would be irresponsible ” to elaborate on such contractual specifics and reaffirming the Havas network 's support for all of its clients ' brands .
Various parties tell us that Havas employees have in some way been encouraged to double as Sears/Kmart customers and that the agency was required to satisfy an unspecified commitment on this front in order to retain the full account .
Havas Worldwide employs more than 10,000 people globally . Several thousand of those staffers work within North America , which is also where most of Sears Holdings ' retail outlets are located .
Before it won the Kmart business last year , Havas had been handling promotional efforts for such in-house Sears brands as Diehard , Kenmore and Craftsman in addition to “ mass media assignments . ”

The chairperson of the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Thursdayreiterated their belief that Texas should consider increasing its electrictransmission interconnections with the rest of the US to reap the fulleconomic benefits of the renewable resources in that state .

`` It would be in Texas ' best economic interest to actually interconnectvery strongly with other interconnects -- either the Western or EasternInterconnect , '' Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in a press briefing following anopen FERC meeting .
`` This is something that , over time , through recognition on the part ofboth the interconnects on this side and Texas on their side , that we 'll seemutual benefits be so high that it will be compelling for Texas to stronglyinterconnect with the rest of the United States , '' Wellinghoff said .
They noted that Texas has a high amount of wind , geothermal and otherrenewable generation resources that will produce more than the state can useat certain times , Wellinghoff said in restating an opinion they first voiced in2009 at an American Wind Energy Association conference in Chicago .
Noting that Texas is considering whether to establish an energy capacitymarket , Wellinghoff said that consideration reflects the fact that `` they neednew capacity internally . If they had access to capacity externally , thatmight provide them some help as well , '' Wellinghoff said .
When asked if there would be a way for Texas to increase itstransmission interconnections to the rest of the US without becoming subjectto FERC transmission rate jurisdiction , Wellinghoff said this is possible ifCongress specifically passed a law to do so .
`` The economic benefits are so compelling that someday someone is goingto start moving toward that solution , '' they said .

In the United Kingdom , a mother-of-six will be taken to the hospital and forced to undergo a sterilization .
In 2014 , the department of health and social services applied for permission to enter the woman 's home and take them to get sterilized against them will . The woman , who has not been identified , reportedly has a learning disability .
At a hearing at the Court of Protection , they argued that sterilization is necessary because the woman 's health would be put at risk if they had more children . However , John McKendrick , who represented a health authority , hospital trust and council said the application fo r sterilization was “ extraordinary ” and would involve serious interference with the woman 's human rights .
According to the Daily Mail , the judge who 's going to rule on the case , Stephen Cobb , held a two-day hearing into the case and heard that health workers have struggled to get the woman to take contraception . The judge said that this case is one of “ enormous gravity . ”
Today , Justice Cobb ruled that the woman can be forcibly sterilized :
Mr Justice Cobb today granted their applications , describing the case as “ exceptional ” – branding the circumstances “ extreme ” and stressing that “ therapeutic sterilisation ” would be lawful and in the woman 's best interests . They declared that the woman lacked the mental capacity to litigate and make decisions regarding contraception . They authorised medics and social services staff to : “ Remove ( the woman ) from their home and take steps to convey them to hospital for the purposes of the sterilisation procedure. ” Click here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com And they said “ necessary and proportionate steps ” could include “ forced entry and necessary restraint ” .
The Court of Protection in London is one of the United Kingdom 's most secretive courts that usually deal with cases involving vulnerable people who lack the mental ability to make decisions for their health themselves . A representative of the Court of Protection , Michael Horne , said , “ The issues have nothing to do with eugenics . It is a “ therapeutic ” sterilization in that it most effectively mitigates the grave risks to health and life that a further pregnancy could bring . '
As LifeNews previously reported , in 2012 the British government gave $ 268 million to the government of India for a program that forcibly sterilizes poor women and men . Wendy Wright explained the inhumane act of forced sterilization . They said , “ Men and women are rounded up into makeshift rural camps to be sterilized , many left in pain with little or no care . Some women , sterilized while pregnant , suffered miscarriages . Some were bribed with less than $ 8 and a sari , others threatened with losing their ration cards . Some died from botched operations . ”
Additionally , in the United States parents of a 32-year-old pregnant woman , known as Mary Moe , withdrew their request to subject their daughter to a forced abortion and sterilization . Moe was being treated at a Massachusetts hospital for schizophrenia and bipolar mood disorder . When they became pregnant , doctors were purportedly concerned that their medications could harm the unborn child . So they recommended an abortion . However , Moe is a Catholic and expressed vocal opposition to abortion .
Since Moe planned to keep their baby , their parents , in conjunction with the doctors , filed a petition with the local courts , which would give them the power to force them to get an abortion . Massachusetts justice Christina Harms not only granted the petition , they went a step further . They told Moe 's parents that it did n't matter how they got Moe to have the abortion , even if it meant they had to be “ coaxed , bribed , or even enticed … by ruse . ”
The Saudi Arabian ambassador to Egypt left Cairo heading for Riyadh today in what critics believe is a result of an ongoing feud between the two countries over Syria .
Ambassador Ahmed Kattan left Cairo on a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight days after Egypt backed a Russian supported UN Security Council resolution on Syria and failed to support the French-drafted bill which had Saudi 's backing .
Egypt 's Al-Ahram newspaper said Kattan was on a three-day trip to Riyadh however critics believe their sudden departure is a sign of a growing rift between the two countries which has seen Saudi 's national petrol company , Aramco , ceased deliveries to the north African country .
Egyptian authorities also recently removed concrete blocks which surrounded the Saudi embassy in Giza . They said the move had been coordinated with the embassy .
Officers of the Russian Federal Security Service ( FSB ) are questioning the students of 9th grade of school No.15 in the village of Blyzhne , which is part of Feodosia town .
This is reported by 15 Minutes local newspaper .
There are Crimean Tatar national classes with Russian language of learning in this school . The students were notified of the FSB officers visit on May 26 .
According to the newspaper , the students and their parents are summoned to a study and are asked about the May holidays , in particular , whether they wore the St. George ribbons on May 9 .
The officers question the boys only .
According to a source from Crimea , when parents asked why the talks were held only in the Crimean Tatar class , the officers replied that it was a planned activity and everyone would be questioned , but it had been decided to start in 9th grade .
The parents are concerned by the FSB questioning , because the children are to pass exam on May 28 exam and they experience stress the day before .
Robert Bates , the sheriff 's reserve deputy who mistook their handgun for a Taser and fatally shot 44-year-old Eric Harris , has reportedly turned themselves in to authorities . ( Reuters )
Days after an Oklahoma reserve deputy sheriff was charged with manslaughter for a fatal incident in which they mistook their gun for a Taser , a report in the Tulsa World has called into question whether they should have been carrying a gun in the first place .
Speaking on the condition of anonymity , individuals told the World that supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office were ordered to falsify training records for Robert Bates , the 73-year-old insurance executive who fired their gun instead of a Taser , killing an unarmed black man , apparently by accident . The false records gave Bates credit for field training they never took and firearms certifications they should not have received , the World reported .
The Tulsa paper added that at least three of Bates 's supervisors were transferred after refusing to sign off on the state-required training .
Bates was certified as a “ reserve deputy ” — a volunteer position that requires applicants to undergo a mental capacity test and obtain certification from Oklahoma 's Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training , local ABC affiliate KJRH reported . Reserve deputies must also re-qualify with a weapon each year .
Harris was shot by a reserve deputy in Tulsa during an altercation with police on April 2 . The 44-year-old was shot as they were trying to flee an undercover operation , authorities said . The reserve deputy later said they thought they were deploying their Taser rather than their gun . The officer was charged with manslaughter . ( Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office via Tulsa World )
Tulsa County Sheriff Stanley Glanz told KJRH that Bates had qualified for three weapons with the supervision of a firearms instructor , but the office was not able to find records from the qualification test . The instructor who trained Bates has since left the Tulsa Sheriff 's Office .
“ And we 're trying to get hold of them and talk to them but we ca n't find the records that they supposedly turned in . So , we 're going to talk to them find out if , for sure , they did qualify with those , ” Glanz said .
Since Bates is an “ advanced ” reserve , they had to have undergone 480 hours of the “ field training officer ” program to maintain their certification .
Advanced reserves are allowed to “ perform normal field duties by themselves and without the direct supervision of a certified deputy , ” according to the Tulsa World .
Undersheriff Tim Albin , responding to earlier questions about Bates 's certifications , told the World the reserve deputy 's training record “ speaks for itself . ”
“ I have absolutely no knowledge of what you are talking about , ” Albin said when asked whether the records had been falsified and supervisors transferred for refusing to approve them . “ There are n't any secrets in law enforcement . Zero . Those types of issues would have come up . ”
Volunteer reserve deputies are a staple of the Tulsa sheriff 's department , where the professional force is supplemented by about 100 volunteers . Bates , who worked for a year as a police officer from 1964-65 , joined the department as a reserve in 2008 .
In 2012 , Bates chaired the Re-Elect Sheriff Glanz Committee and donated $ 2,500 to Glanz 's campaign , the World reported . They have also purchased five vehicles and other equipment for the Tulsa Sheriff 's Violent Crimes Task Force , of which Bates was a member .
In a seven page statement to investigators obtained by the Tulsa World Wednesday , Bates said they had contacted a task force member on April 1 to ask if there was an operation with which they could assist . The reserve deputy was assigned to the April 2 undercover operation during which Bates accidentally shot and killed the suspect , 44-year-old Eric Harris .
A lawyer for Harris 's family has also expressed doubt about the accuracy of Bates 's records .
“ There is absolutely no way , if Mr. Bates had been trained at all … an officer who is trained would never get these two weapons confused , ” attorney Dan Smollen said at a Monday news conference .
Uniformed men look out of military vehicles bearing no license plates as they travel on the road from Feodosia to Simferopol in the Crimea , Ukraine .
DOZENS of military trucks transporting heavily armed soldiers have rumbled over Crimea 's rutted roads as Russia reinforced its armed presence on the disputed peninsula in the Black Sea . Moscow 's foreign minister ruled out any dialogue with Ukraine 's new authorities , whom they dismissed as the puppets of extremists .
The Russians have denied their armed forces are active in Crimea , but an Associated Press reporter trailed one military convoy on Saturday afternoon from 40km west of Feodosia to a military airfield at Gvardeiskoe north of Simferopol , over which a Russian flag flew .
Some of the army green vehicles had Russian license plates and numbers indicating that they were from the Moscow region . Some towed mobile kitchens and what appeared to be mobile medical equipment .

The strategic peninsula in southern Ukraine has become the flashpoint in the battle for Ukraine , where three months of protests sparked by President Victor Yanukovych 's decision to ditch a significant treaty with the 28-nation European Union after strong pressure from Russia led to their downfall . A majority of people in Crimea identify with Russia , and Moscow 's Black Sea Fleet is based in Sevastopol , as is Ukraine 's .
Vladislav Seleznyov , a Crimean-based spokesperson for the Ukrainian armed forces , told AP that witnesses had reported seeing amphibious military ships unloading around 200 military vehicles in eastern Crimea on Friday night after apparently having crossed the Straits of Kerch , which separates Crimea from Russian territory .
“ Neither the equipment , nor the paratroopers have insignia that identify them as Russian , but we have no doubt as to their allegiance , ” Seleznyov said .
The amphibious operation appeared to be one of the largest movements of Russian military forces since they appeared in Crimea a week ago .
Seleznyov also said a convoy of more than 60 military trucks was spotted Saturday heading from Feodosia toward Simferopol , the regional capital . An AP reporter caught up with the convoy and trailed it to a Russian-controlled airfield . In the rear of the vehicles , heavily armed soldiers could be seen , though none appeared to have identifying badges or insignia . Soldiers spat at the reporters following them .
A small plane belonging to the Ukrainian border guards was fired on by “ extremists ” using automatic weapons as it flew near the administrative border of Crimea , but took evasive manoeuvres and escaped unscathed , the Interfax news agency reported , quoting Ukrainian officials .
The regional parliament in Crimea has set a March 16 referendum on leaving Ukraine to join Russia , and senior lawmakers in Moscow said they would support the move , ignoring sanctions threats and warnings from President Barack Obama that the vote would violate international law .
While the US and the EU urged Russia to engage in dialogue with new Ukrainian authorities , the Kremlin has refused to do so , denouncing the change of power in Ukraine as an “ unconstitutional coup . ”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow sees no sense in talking with Ukraine 's new authorities because , in their view , they kowtow to radical nationalists .
“ The so-called interim government is n't independent . It depends , to our great regret , on radical nationalists who have seized power with arms , ” they said at a news conference . They said that nationalist groups use “ intimidation and terror ” to control Ukraine .
Despite that tough talk , the Russian Foreign Ministry said Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin met Saturday with Ukrainian Ambassador Volodymyr Yelchenko , the first such diplomatic contact since the crisis began . In a terse statement , the ministry said only that they discussed issues related to Russian-Ukrainian ties in a “ sincere atmosphere . ”
At a news conference in Kiev , Ukraine 's new foreign minister , Andrii Deshchytsi , spoke hopefully about creation of a contact group made up of foreign ministers of various countries to mediate the crisis . Forming the group was an idea discussed during meetings between Ukraine 's prime minister and European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday .
Deshchytsi said that they learned from mediators that Russia has n't “ categorically ' refused the idea of permitting a contact group to help broker an end to the dispute .
“ The Russians are thinking , ” Deshchytsi said , so there is “ reason to hope. ” They reiterated that the new Ukrainian government understands it is vital to establish good relations with all neighbours , including Russia .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow has no intention of annexing Crimea , but that its people have the right to determine the region 's status in a referendum .
The Crimean referendum has been denounced by Ukraine 's new government . The U.S. moved Thursday to impose its first sanctions on Russians involved in the military occupation of Crimea .
Speaking on the BBC on Saturday , NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that while there is no military response to the recent events of Crimea , the crisis was a reminder of threats to European security and stability .
“ I do believe that politicians all over NATO will now rethink the whole thing about investment in security and defence , ” they told the BBC . “ Obviously , defence comes at a cost but insecurity is much more expensive . ”
An international military mission composed of officers from the U.S. and 28 other nations tried again Saturday to enter Crimea , but it was turned back around the town of Armiansk by armed men .
An AP reporter travelling with the 54 observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said that after the group had stopped , the armed men fired bursts of automatic weapons fire to halt other unidentified vehicles . No injuries were reported .
In Simferopol , meanwhile , a public ceremony was held for the swearing-in of the first unit in the pro-Russia “ Military Forces of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. ” About 30 men armed with AK-47s , and another 20 or so unarmed , turned out . They ranged in age from teenagers to a man who looked to be about 60 . They were sworn in at a park in front of an eternal flame to those killed in World War II .
Sergei Aksyonov , the Crimean prime minister , came to the ceremony and was greeted by the soldiers with shouts of “ Commander ! ”
They said their main role , at least until the referendum , would be to “ keep the peace. ” They said they did n't foresee any fighting with the Ukrainian soldiers still at bases in Crimea .
“ We are not enemies with those soldiers who pledged loyalty to the Ukrainian state . They are not our enemies , ” Aksyonov said . They said they could safely leave Crimea if they wanted to .
In the week since Russia seized control of Crimea , Russian troops have been disarming Ukrainian military bases here . Some Ukrainian units , however , have refused to give up . Aksyonov has said pro-Russian forces numbering more than 11,000 now control all access to the region and have blockaded all military bases that have n't yet surrendered .
On Friday evening , pro-Russia soldiers tried to take over another Ukrainian base in Sevastopol , resulting in a tense standoff that lasted for several hours .
Lt. Col. Vitaly Onishchenko , deputy commander of the base , said three dozen men wearing unmarked camouflage uniforms arrived late Friday . While one group climbed over a wall on one side of the base , another crashed a heavy military truck through the gates , Onishchenko said .
They said Saturday that they turned off power , cut telephone lines and demanded that about 100 Ukrainian troops , who barricaded themselves into one of the base buildings , surrender their weapons and swear allegiance to Russia . The invaders left around midnight .
No shots were fired in and no injuries were reported .
Russia has described the troops who wear green uniforms without insignia as local “ self-defence forces. ” But Onishchenko said the troops who tried to overrun their base were clearly Russian .
“ These were Russian servicemen specially ordered , ” they said .
“ Their watches were set to Moscow time . They spoke with Russian accents and they did n't hide their allegiance to the Russian Federation . ”

Let 's hope Kevin Durant and Robinson Cano learn a lesson from `` Magna Carta Holy Grail '' , Jay-Z 's latest CD .
Article continues below ...
Let 's hope they notice that the CEO of Roc Nation Sports did not seek 16 or eight bars from King James , Black Mamba , Melo or Birdman . You also wo n't find CP3 , The Truth or AK47 on any hooks on `` Magna Carta '' . There are no beats from Captain Jack , Metta World Peace or Mr. Big Shot .
Nope . When Jay-Z makes an album , when they do anything involving the music career that made them rich and famous , they only works with the best and brightest from the music industry . Only the most accomplished and skilled need apply .
Let 's hope Durant and Cano are paying attention , taking notes and analyzing their agent 's brilliance .
They should not be surprised that Justin Timberlake 's voice is the first you hear on `` Magna Carta '' . J.T . is the holy grail of pop music . Nor should they be surprised to learn that Beyonce , Rick Ross , Timbaland and Pharrell Williams worked on `` Magna Carta '' . They are the holy grail of R & B , gangsta rap and beats , respectively .
Jay-Z is the holy grail of n * gga rap , the proper name for the genre of music that made Shawn Carter one of our president 's best friends . Oh , I 'm sure that 's upsetting and disconcerting for some of you to read . You 'd prefer I label the Jigga Man a gangsta rapper . They are n't . He 's a n * gga rapper . Listen to their music .
On the opening track of `` Magna Carta '' , a song dominated by Timberlake 's singing , Jay-Z pops in just enough to rattle off `` n * gga '' eight times . He 's perfected the art form of repeatedly saying the N-word over slickly produced musical beats while telling stories about fame , fortune , family and a former life of crime .
Jay-Z 's music is a `` Cosby Show '' - '' New Jack City '' - '' MTV Cribs '' mashup narrated by `` Django Unchained '' house slave Stephen .
Jay-Z 's success and their exalted status in the black community speak to the power of our self-hatred , delusional ignorance and unwillingness to learn from our history .
There 's always been a comfy bed , a pretty belly-warmer and a bright spotlight at the big house for the black performer willing to entertain the masses with n * gga tales .
Jay-Z is not slang for Jesus . Hova is no one 's savior . He 's a new-millennium Stephen . He 's highly compensated to spin catchy fairy tales that promote the self-destructive notion that the path out of black American poverty and into the American Dream is through the drug trade and criminality .
Our political system — on the right and left — is so bankrupt of ethics that President Obama has zero shame about embracing the king of black-denigration music .
And neither do Kevin Durant and Robinson Cano .
They 're kids who have swallowed mass-media propaganda . They 're no more or less gullible than the American adults who swallowed the propaganda about home ownership at the beginning of this century .
Jay-Z is the cure for everything . He 's cracked the code . Of course , the king of rap music is the ideal candidate to represent black athletes . It 's really too bad Michael Jackson passed away before we realized musical geniuses could parlay their talents and expertise into other industries .
The Gloved One and Hova could 've combined to open a sports agency and a string of barbershops , beauty salons and soul-food kitchens .
Or maybe Durant , Cano and other athletes will pick up `` Magna Carta Holy Grail '' and realize what Jay-Z wo n't tell them : When you 're blessed with talent , it 's best that you stay in your lane and align yourself with talented people in your field .
Jay-Z is n't asking basketball or baseball players to help them create rap music . He 's paying musicians to do it . Universal Music Group and The Island Def Jam Music Group help promote and distribute Roc-A-Fella Records , not ESPN or FOX Sports .
The marriage of Jay-Z to the sports world is idiotic .
Selling athletic competition and selling music are two distinctly different disciplines . Sports are founded in traditional , mainstream American values . Music , particularly rap and rock , is founded in rebellion and anti-establishment values .
Jay-Z 's sensibilities do not comfortably co-exist with the sensibilities that best promote athletic culture . The NBA 's headfirst embrace of hip-hop music is one of the main reasons the league has lost relevancy the last 15 years . Blaming it all on the aging and retirement of Michael Jordan and/or the Pistons-Pacers brawl at The Palace is intellectually lazy and David Stern-friendly propaganda .
LeBron James is as compelling an athlete America has produced since Muhammad Ali . James ' rise is a far superior story to Michael Jordan 's . James is Tiger Woods and Mike Tyson in one 6-foot-8 , 250-pound , slam-dunking package .
On symbolic , real and intangible levels , the NBA 's values are more closely aligned with the rebellious and individualistic characteristics of music than the patriotic characteristics of sports . That 's why LeBron does n't connect the way Jordan did and does . That 's why basketball ca n't compete with football despite basketball being the sport that every American boy or girl plays at least once in their lives . Everyone understands and can relate to basketball . It should rival football in popularity .
It is not a coincidence that Jay-Z is having the most difficulty getting certified as an NFL agent . Pete Rozelle , Paul Tagliabue , Roger Goodell and the league 's television partners have worked diligently to make football as American as mom and apple pie .
Jay-Z has worked diligently to make n * gga rap as unwittingly self-destructive and seductive as possible .
Despite its reliance on young African-American athletes , the NFL has made the wise business choice of keeping some significant distance between itself and the youth music culture enthusiastically consumed and followed by many of its young employees .
Unless Durant and Cano plan to moonlight as rappers , Jay-Z has nothing of value to offer them or the sports world . Their marketing genius and innovation are myths .
Fiddler , in the TV miniseries `` Roots '' , educated black folks on the rewards of bojangling 300 years ago . They and their banjo are still the holy grail of n * gga music .
Jay-Z is their disciple .
As a kid I fantasized about being a scientist . What discipline ? Did n't matter , I just loved asking questions about the world . The year after I took biology I wanted to be a biologist . The year after chemistry , a chemist . And the same with physics . In high school I loaded my schedule with as many STEM courses as I could fit . Science was my compass as well as my refuge – it gave me direction during a rough time in my life while also providing me with confidence and a sense of safety . And while I aced my science classes and AP exams , those good grades hid an unsteady foundation that collapsed when I got to college .
I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in middle school . My dad is a therapist who also has ADHD , so it was n't exactly shocking news to my family . It helped to explain the trouble I was having in school . I did well on every test , but could n't get homework and projects in on time because my executive functioning was utter garbage . It also helped to explain some of my social issues . No conversation went uninterrupted and no personal bubble was inviolate – I talked over others and could n't keep my hands to myself . For these reasons I struggled in my classes and in my friendships . Except science classes – those were my haven ! The science department at my high school not only taught me to think , it supported me emotionally for four years .
Then I got to college . Good school , very prestigious . Except I quickly learned that universities accrue prestige through funding and citations , not necessarily for having good teachers . My professors were luminaries in their fields and their names were on my textbooks , but gone were the days of my teachers caring about me . In high school , my science teachers believed in me and with their guidance I flourished . But in college I was supposed to shut up , sit down , and listen . Which , for an eighteen-year-old kid with ADHD , meant I was n't learning much and my motivation was steadily eroding .
But my high school education was good , so I did n't actually have to learn anything new for my introductory science classes . For the first two years I kept doing well on tests so I got good grades . But come junior year , after declaring a major , it started falling apart . My ADHD brain was poorly equipped for lectures and my senior year was an utter disaster . I did n't end up graduating , not that year . Five years later I made up my coursework at another university , but in the meantime I was convinced I did n't have what it took to be a scientist . I entered college dreaming of nanotechnology ( I really liked chemistry ) but by the end I thought science simply was n't an option for me .
I 'm writing this because the last couple days brought up some bitter memories . The Twitter account @ iamscicomm has a rotating curation and each week a different science communicator shares stories and engages with an audience of scientists and laypeople alike . This week was different , though . I do n't want to get too much into details – the internet shame machine is already spinning up and I have no interest in joining the chorus . But I do want to share why it hurt as much as it did . Because I ca n't be the only kid who grew up playing with salamanders , dreaming of becoming a scientist , only to lose that dream in a sterile lecture hall .
Here are the only two tweets I want to consider . For context , the first is in response to a comment about active learning .
@ AmandaFreise Some . It 's a whole toolbox , but I strongly believe in 'sit down , shut up , listen to an expert ' as a guiding principle . — I Am SciComm ( @ iamscicomm ) August 3 , 2016
Science is serious stuff . The glory and the 'fun ' is found in the struggle ; in the misery ; in the grind . — I Am SciComm ( @ iamscicomm ) August 2 , 2016
My college experience shattered not only my confidence but also my sense of identity . I did n't know what to do so I got a job working in software development . Let me tell you : I hated that job . And honestly , I 'm thankful I hated it as much as I did because it forced me to reassess everything . I decided to pursue ornithology and now , four years later , I 'm happily ensconced in a master 's program studying biogeography . In pursuing science , I 've returned to my refuge .
Outside lectures , my ADHD works for me , not against me . ADHD , despite the word “ deficit ” in its name , is n't a lack of attention so much as it 's an inability to direct your attention . People with ADHD tend to hyperfocus on the things that interest them . I can spend hours happily reading papers , writing code , or sitting in a blind waiting for a bird to return to its nest . I have exactly what it takes to be a scientist , goddammit , so when I read someone dictating that being a scientist means “ sit down shut up and listen ” or “ the struggle the misery the grind ” it pisses me off . Because I ca n't do either of those things , not well at least . And there are so many people in positions of authority who think the same way that I took it as gospel . I almost missed out on my passion , my dream career . I almost spent my life as a miserable programmer because close-minded educators ca n't muster empathy for a scared kid struggling with a learning disorder . The man who wrote those tweets above ? They would have written me off without batting an eyelash .
At least I had the opportunity to get back on track . I come from an upper middle class family with a strong history of education . If I 'd come from a background with less fiscal and social capital there is no chance I 'd be where I am now . And that 's exactly who this attitude of “ sit down shut up and listen ” hurts most : those with the least resources . After college , I had the good fortune of taking biology classes from Dr. Scott Freeman at the University of Washington . A biologist by training , they have since done extensive research into the teaching of science at the university level . He 's found that alternatives to lecturing , like active learning , make very little impact on better prepared students from wealthier backgrounds , but significant differences for the less prepared [ 1 ] . Science is overwhelmingly white as it is , and expecting everyone to succeed in lecture settings wo n't help . The author of those tweets is wrong to frame science that way and I hope the students he 's writing off are fortunate enough to find inspiration elsewhere . The ability to sit still and absorb information for 75 minutes at a time does n't make you a scientist – curiosity and a passion for understanding the world does .

BoxingScene.com has been advised that former three division champion Abner Mares ( 26-1 , 14KOs ) has suffered a rib injury while sparring in Mexico City . When reached on Monday afternoon , Mares ' manager Frank Espinoza confirmed the reports that are circulating in Mexico .
`` Yes , the reports in Mexico are accurate . Abner did injure a rib in sparring , but I do n't know anything else [ regarding the extent of the injury ] because I 'm not down there , '' Espinoza told BoxingScene.com .
Mares are scheduled to face WBC featherweight champion Jhonny Gonzalez on February 15th at the Staples Center in Los Angeles . The fight was a rematch of their August battle , which saw Gonzalez score a shocking first round knockout .
A new date is unknown at the moment , says Espinoza , who already reached out to Golden Boy Promotions to discuss a new date . However , sources informed BoxingScene 's Chris Robinson that a date of March 15th has been mentioned .
This post is part of a series that compares Ardor to other blockchain projects with similar features or goals . You can find the previous posts here :
This week I studied Komodo , the blockchain platform that forms the basis of SuperNET .
SuperNET
Like Waves , SuperNET was founded by someone who was quite active in the Nxt community in the past . And as with my article about Waves , I wo n't attempt to rehash that history here .
Suffice it to say that James/jl777 was the developer behind SuperNET , the Multigateway , and several other projects on Nxt , including a number of assets on the Nxt Asset Exchange , but they left the Nxt community during the turbulent period of late 2015 and early 2016 . Since then , they have created the Komodo platform , which now serves as the foundation of SuperNET .
The vision of SuperNET is to enable users to seamlessly transact with many different cryptocurrencies in order to enjoy the unique advantages of each coin . The experience is to be so seamless , in fact , that the user might not even realize that they or they are using multiple coins . For example , if I understand correctly , a SuperNET application might allow users to transact privately with Bitcoin by converting to and from a privacy coin like Komodo behind the scenes . From a user 's perspective , it would be as if Bitcoin had “ borrowed ” Komodo 's privacy feature .
SuperNET is n't itself a blockchain . Rather , it is a framework comprising several parts . The main ones are :
Komodo , a blockchain anchored to Bitcoin ; assetchains and geckochains , independent blockchains anchored to Komodo ; the Agama wallet , a multicoin wallet ; BarterDEX , a decentralized exchange ( DEX ) that will be integrated into the Agama wallet ; and , Iguana , the codebase that underlies the Agama wallet and part of Komodo .
Note that much of the literature about SuperNET refers to the Agama wallet as the “ Iguana wallet , ” which was its previous name .
The “ anchoring ” process in items 1 and 2 is Komodo 's delayed proof-of-work consensus algorithm , which I describe next . I 'll return to BarterDEX later .
Delayed Proof of Work
Komodo is a fork of zCash , which is a blockchain that uses zero-knowledge proofs ( via zk-SNARKs ) to allow users to transact without publicly revealing their account numbers or the amounts that they exchange . Komodo has added several features to its branch of the zCash codebase , including the delayed proof-of-work ( dPoW ) consensus algorithm and a mechanism for creating additional blockchains that are periodically anchored to the Komodo chain .
The dPoW white paper argues that the dPoW mechanism allows any blockchain to secure itself using Bitcoin 's hashpower by periodically notarizing itself to Bitcoin . In a nutshell , consensus on the weaker blockchain occurs in two stages : an initial consensus by normal means ( e.g. , PoW or PoS ) , and a second layer of consensus established periodically by a set of notary nodes , elected by stakeholders , that record a hash of the weaker chain 's most recent block on the Bitcoin blockchain . All nodes on the network agree that , in the event of a fork , they will not reorganize the blockchain past the last time it was notarized on Bitcoin .
In this way , the author argues , the weaker blockchain inherits some of the security of Bitcoin . Even an attacker with a large majority of the network 's hashpower wo n't be able to modify the blockchain back past the most recently notarized block . Accordingly , somebody who waits for a transaction on the weaker chain to be notarized on Bitcoin can be confident that it wo n't be reversed .
The white paper also proposes a mechanism to allow the network to fall back to the initial consensus mechanism in the event that the notary nodes become unavailable . The idea is that all nodes on the network are eligible to mine , but the notary nodes are assigned a lower difficulty level than normal nodes . As a result , notary nodes will normally win most or all blocks , but if an attacker were to somehow take them offline–by a DDoS attack , for example–normal nodes would be able to continue mining blocks and the blockchain would continue uninterrupted , except without the added security of Bitcoin . In this way , the dPoW chain is somewhat less centralized than it appears at first blush .
This line of reasoning does beg the question of exactly what is gained by the notarization mechanism , though . In particular , if an attacker can gain control of the notary nodes , they can prevent them from signing the Bitcoin transactions that notarize the weaker chain 's blocks , forcing the weaker blockchain to rely only on its initial consensus . So it appears that the extra security provided by the notarization process depends implicitly on an honest majority of notary nodes .
[ EDIT : After talking with jl777 , I learned that Komodo allows a minority of notaries , 13 out of 64 , to sign each notarizing transaction . This simultaneously reduces the Bitcoin fees that must be paid and makes the proposed attack harder , since an attacker would have to control a supermajority of notaries to defeat the notarization mechanism . My original statements were based off of what they wrote in the dPoW white paper , which suggests that 33 of the 64 notaries must sign the notarizing transactions . ]
This is basically the security model of delegated proof-of-stake ( DPOS ) blockchains like BitShares . In both dPoW and DPOS , users vote by stake for a set of “ special ” accounts that the rest of the network depends upon for its security . Both systems suffer the same weaknesses , too : a burden on users to keep up with the “ politics ” of the system to know which accounts are trustworthy enough to vote for , and the corresponding voter apathy that this burden produces .
All things considered , I 'm not sure I see a strong case for dPoW over and above other alternatives . If the weaker chain 's initial consensus mechanism is strong enough to secure it , given its current economic value , then paying Bitcoin fees to notarize it seems like a waste of money . If the initial consensus is not sufficient , on the other hand , then it seems that the security of the chain rests entirely on the election of honest notaries . But in that case , why not use DPOS and take advantage of the increased transaction throughput that DPOS chains have achieved ?
Setting these considerations aside , though , it is worth noting that the Komodo platform uses nested dPoW chains to help achieve SuperNET 's vision of interconnecting a variety of different blockchains . Komodo 's additional chains are called “ assetchains ” and “ geckochains ” . These chains notarize themselves to Komodo , which in turn notarizes itself to Bitcoin . Again , the claim is that all chains involved inherit the level of security of Bitcoin , but as described above , a lot depends on each chain 's notary nodes .
Unlike assets on Nxt and Ardor , or even child chains on Ardor , Komodo 's assetchains are fully independent blockchains . Their only connection to the Komodo chain is the dPoW notarization mechanism . In this way , they are perhaps closer to the sidechains that Lisk and Stratis envision than they are to Ardor 's tightly-coupled child chains .
Geckochains are like assetchains but with support for smart contracts . I have n't found many details about geckochains , and they do n't appear to be available yet , but the Komodo client does currently support assetchains via a command-line interface .
BarterDEX
SuperNET 's decentralized exchange , called BarterDEX , allows users to atomically trade coins across supported blockchains in a trustless way . The team has not yet integrated it into the Agama wallet 's user interface , but they 're working on it now , and in the meantime BarterDEX can be used on its own .
BarterDEX consists of three main components : a designated set of nodes for matching orders ; a set of “ liquidity provider ” nodes to act as market makers ; and a protocol for users to exchange coins from two different blockchains with each other as a single , atomic operation .
The order-matching nodes serve the same role as they do in Waves : they partially centralize the task of matching buy and sell orders in order to provide a more responsive user experience . This way , traders do n't have to wait for the next blocks on the blockchains in question to know whether their orders have been filled or to cancel an order .
Liquidity provider ( LP ) nodes maintain balances of at least two supported coins and automatically trade them at a user-defined profit margin relative to a centralized exchange . For example , it is possible to set up an LP node that trades BTC and KMD on BarterDEX and also on Bittrex . Operators of LP nodes assume the risk associated with holding funds on a centralized exchange , and in return they profit from arbitrage opportunities between the two markets . Other BarterDEX users , for their part , get more liquidity and tighter bid-ask spreads than they would see otherwise , without having to store their coins on centralized exchanges .
After a user 's order is matched , likely to an order submitted by an LP node , BarterDEX uses an atomic cross-chain swap protocol to settle the trade on the two blockchains involved . Presumably the details vary somewhat depending on the trading pair , but conceptually the process is similar in each case . One blockchain is assumed to be compatible with Bitcoin , or at least to support the equivalent of Bitcoin 's hashed timelocked contracts ( HTLCs ) . The other blockchain must support 2-of-2 multisig transactions .
Suppose Bob is trading their funds on the Bitcoin-compatible chain for Alice 's coins on the other chain . Alice and Bob each create a public key/private key pair and exchange public keys and hashes of the private keys . Alice sends Bob a 2-of-2 multisig transaction that they can spend once they know both private keys , and Bob sends Alice a hashed timelocked transaction that Alice can spend by revealing their private key . Once they do , Bob uses it to unlock their multisig transaction and the trade is complete .
The protocol adds a bit of complexity to protect each party in the case that the other exits the process early . If Alice walks away without spending the transaction that Bob sent , Bob can recover their funds after the timelock on that transaction expires by using their own private key . Conversely , in order to protect Alice from the same risk , the protocol requires Bob to submit an initial “ deposit ” in the form of a hashed timelocked transaction . If they walk away before paying Alice , they can wait for the timelock on this deposit to expire and claim it for herself .
This is admittedly only a high-level overview of the atomic swap protocol , but hopefully it gives you an idea of how it works . The most important part is that there is no centralized exchange to facilitate the trade : Alice and Bob have exchanged coins on different blockchains without having to trust each other or some intermediary . You can find more details in the BarterDEX white paper .
Compared to Ardor
What do we make of Komodo and SuperNET , then ? This question largely hinges on whether Komodo 's delayed proof-of-work algorithm offers a substantial degree of additional security to Komodo and its assetchains . In my view , it does not : it offers roughly the same degree of security as the delegated proof-of-stake algorithm , even if the notary blockchain is assumed to be perfectly immutable .
In this light , Komodo 's assetchains look a lot like the user-deployable sidechains that Lisk and Stratis aim to offer . In all three projects , and in contrast to Ardor 's child chains , each assetchain or sidechain is responsible for its own security . Komodo seems to have a head start on both Lisk and Stratis in terms of functionality , though , as users can already deploy their own assetchains and conduct atomic swaps on some pairs .
Note that Ardor 's child chains store hashes of their blocks on the Ardor chain , rather like Komodo stores hashes of its blocks on Bitcoin , but there is a crucial difference : Ardor 's forging nodes validate all child chain transactions . Each child chain effectively inherits all of the forging power of the Ardor chain , rendering it just as secure as Ardor and obviating the need for separate miners or forgers .
With regard to cross-chain atomic swaps , Ardor and Komodo are perhaps a bit more comparable . Ardor natively supports transactions among child chains and also between each child chain and the parent chain . Moreover , it supports a phased transaction type that is equivalent to 2-of-2 multisig , enabling the same kinds of atomic swaps with Bitcoin-compatible blockchains that BarterDEX uses . Ardor even adds the ability to combine multiple phasing conditions with Boolean AND , OR , and NOT operators , potentially allowing users to create the equivalent of a hashed timelocked transaction . Using BarterDEX 's approach , this feature could enable atomic cross-chain swaps to any blockchain that supports 2-of-2 multisig .
Conclusion
SuperNET 's vision of independent but interconnected blockchains is quite compelling , and between the Komodo platform , the Agama wallet , and the BarterDEX exchange , SuperNET has made real progress towards realizing that vision . While I am skeptical that the delayed proof-of-work algorithm provides substantial additional security to Komodo and its assetchains , the ability to quickly deploy an assetchain at least puts Komodo ahead of Lisk and Stratis in the race to build a functioning sidechain platform . Also , I see a lot of value in the ability to easily conduct cross-chain atomic swaps using BarterDEX .
Even so , I have to wonder whether there exists at the heart of SuperNET a fundamental tension between two of its goals . On the one hand , it aims to integrate the best features of many disparate blockchains , providing users and developers a seamless way to enjoy the unique advantages that each chain offers . On the other hand , it has offered Komodo as a single platform to solve most problems , supporting as it does private transactions , user-provisioned sidechains , and , in the future , smart contracts . Success at either of these goals seems to undermine efforts to achieve the other .
Ardor , for its part , also has a compelling vision , and one that is perhaps a bit more coherent : to support a multitude of businesses and projects on its child chains , making available to each a set of prepackaged features , allowing each to interact with the others , and requiring none to provide for its own security or to store forever the histories of the others . Ardor already offers most of the technology required to realize this vision ; what remains are for businesses , developers , and users to put that technology to good use .

All of the analysis and pregame festivities are almost over . Super Bowl 50 is nearly here , and it 's time to make our final cases for who will take the trophy . Here is why the Denver Broncos will win their third Super Bowl title on Sunday night :
Havoc-causing pass rushers
Just ask Tom Brady what DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller mean to Denver 's defense . The duo led a gang of game-plan wreckers that hit the Patriots quarterback an outrageous 20 times in the AFC Championship Game despite blitzing on just 16 percent of their snaps . Outside linebackers coach Fred Pagac gushed about Ware 's smarts and natural abilities , calling them `` as good as they get , '' and Miller `` as good an athlete as I 've been around in 37 years of coaching . '' It does n't stop there . Derek Wolfe has been a force of nature , while fellow defensive lineman Malik Jackson has pushed the pocket all season . Carolina has jumped out to massive leads in their past two games , but that wo n't be so easy against Denver 's active and vicious front seven .
Special teams heroics
What a time to be alive if your name is Britton Colquitt . The Broncos punter was money in the bank against the Patriots , dropping a trio of punts inside New England 's 12-yard line in the AFC title game . The week before , they pinned the Steelers deep in their own territory with the help of special-teamer Kayvon Webster . `` When you look at the league statistics overall , '' said special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis , per MileHighSports.com , `` it does n't make any difference if it 's the Panthers or whoever it is , the average start has so much to do with the offense 's success . ''
The reader is suspicious that we 're talking punters this high in the post , but plenty of recent Super Bowls have pivoted off special teams excellence . If Denver 's defense gets the kind of field-position advantage we saw over the past few weeks , the Broncos have an excellent shot of keeping this game close .
Carolina 's struggles vs. the zone read
Broncos running back C.J . Anderson told me that he 's enjoyed the shift to Gary Kubiak 's zone-read blocking scheme , a system that requires patience from ball-carriers . While this offense has its issues -- only the abysmal Titans had more three-and-outs -- Denver is 9-0 when they rush for 105-plus yards . That wo n't be easy against Carolina 's front seven , but in their only loss of the year to Atlanta , the Panthers had their issues against Kyle Shanahan 's zone-run scheme . The Falcons did n't pile up much yardage on the ground , but 30 carries helped chew 35-plus minutes off the clock . If you do n't want to deal with Cam Newton , keeping them on the sideline is your best move .
Wade Phillips
Denver 's coordinator improves defenses wherever they go . It was impressive to hear them emphasize all week how the Broncos believe in fitting their scheme around the roster . That is n't a major challenge with so much talent in Denver , but Phillips has plenty to do with it . They were whispered about this week as the best defensive coordinator in NFL history , and it 's not a crazy thought . He 's lived and breathed football from the cradle on , growing up under legendary coach Bum Phillips , who Chris Wesseling chronicled in last summer 's excellent `` Luv Ya Blue ! '' longform . Phillips was masterful against the Patriots , using a swath of combination-man coverages to swallow up Patriots wideouts and confuse Brady . Tommy Boy barely threw a good pass in the first half , with the game film showing that Denver 's defensive sets put New England in a bind . The chess match between Phillips and Carolina play-caller Mike Shula promises to be a gem .
`` They 're so fast and I think the best way you can talk about how well they 're coached , and what a good job Wade does is when you see them diagnose so quickly , '' Shula said . `` They get to the ball so fast even on the missed direction stuff . They seem to find the ball quick and they 're swarming to the ball . You know they 'll play some backups and a lot of their backups could start for just about anybody and there 's not that big of a drop off . ''
Pick-your-poison secondary
Yup , we 're going defense again , and here 's why : One of the reasons Denver was able to confuse the heck out of Brady was a loaded secondary packed with a combination of sticky cover men and hard-hitting play from the safety position . Denver 's loaded with Aqib Talib and Chris Harris at corner and T.J. Ward and Darian Stewart behind them . Second-year corner Bradley Roby also looms as a star-in-the-making for the only secondary league-wide to allow under 200 yards per game through the air . The Panthers have exploded early on offense in recent weeks , but do n't expect a repeat of Super Bowl XLVIII for the Broncos : They 've allowed just one of 18 teams to score 30-plus points this season -- tops in the NFL .
Unbalanced ? So what
Long gone is Denver 's record-breaking offense of 2013 , but we 're talking about a team that 's won 14 games . They 're not nearly as balanced as white-hot Carolina , but the Broncos are just the fourth team since the 1970 merger to lead the NFL in the fewest yards allowed per carry and fewest yards allowed per throw . They 're also comprehensively healthy , assuming Ward and Stewart are full-go at the safety spots . Every Broncos player I spoke with this week emphasized how different this team is from the one that got crushed by the Seahawks two seasons ago . That Broncos squad rolled in with the No . 1 offense against Seattle 's No . 1 defense -- this time around it 's Denver with the top defense in all the land .
`` There are a lot of guys that are still here , and ... I know they do n't want that taste in their mouth again , so I think it means a little bit more , '' Ward said of Super Bowl XLVIII . `` The guys that were there , nothing needs to be said about that . They know what happened . That performance is not going to be repeated . ''
Peyton 's date with destiny
Logic be damned ! Carolina 's the heavy favorite , but the NFL would n't be the greatest sports league on Planet Earth if it did n't also cater to magic . Peyton Manning was on the pine three weeks ago as the capper to an altogether embarrassing campaign . Plenty of doubters -- me included -- thought they were cooked , but Manning now has the chance to author one of the greatest stories in NFL history . Their teammates talked endlessly this week about wanting to send them out with a win . These are human beings -- not droids -- and the Broncos came across as a team drawing strength from Manning 's final push for glory .
`` It would mean everything . That 's my brother , '' receiver Emmanuel Sanders said of winning one for Peyton . `` It 'd be unique to allow them -- if they decide to hang it up -- to go out with a ring . That 's everybody 's dream , to retire , to say , this is my last year and you go out with a ring . I mean , the football gods really do love you , and based on their career , they really do love Peyton . ''
We 'll find out if that 's true come Super Bowl Sunday .

Senior Producer
Winston Sardine reads through the notes they wrote after their prostate surgery last May .
`` The operating room experience was somewhat brief , just enough time to look at the multi-armed equipment as they were securing me onto the operating table and getting me hooked up to the anesthetic and then , lights out , '' wrote the 71-year-old from Hagersville .
Sardine 's surgical experience at Hamilton 's St Joseph 's Healthcare was a unique one , which is clear to them looking back at those notes . They laugh before they read about the `` multi-armed equipment '' that performed their procedure .
They are one of over a hundred patients who underwent surgery in the last year with the da Vinci Surgical robot system , one of the most advanced surgical tools in the world and the only one in the local health network .
But with the initial funding running out there is uncertainty about where the money will come from to keep it operating . Dr. Bobby Shayegan , uro oncologist and chair of the robotic program at St. Joseph 's said it is so successful that the hospital will find a way , including asking for private donations .
`` For a physician its much more accurate technology . I have a range of movements that a human hand would not have , so what I can do with a small , narrow male pelvis is more than I can ever do with my own hand , '' said Dr. Shayegan .
Shayegan helped bring the da Vinci to the Hamilton hospital in late 2011 before putting it into use a few months later in 2012 . They use the robot primarily for urological surgeries , like removal of the prostate , but it can also perform gynecological , cardiac , thoracic and oral procedures with a trained surgeon , Shayegan said .
After Sardine was diagnosed with prostate cancer and met with Shayegan about surgery , they researched the da Vinci robot , watching procedures posted online . Noting that the robotic surgery seemed `` less intrusive , '' they chose that option over a traditional procedure .
`` I 've had absolutely zero problems [ post-surgery ] , '' Sardine said . `` I understand from a number of people , including my doctor and my wife 's doctor , that this is unusual . ''
Sardine said its typical of patients who have their prostate removed to experience incontinence for up to six weeks after surgery , but it did n't happen to him . Shayegan performed Sardine 's prostate surgery on May 7 of last year , and they were back at home on May 9 .
`` There is not doubt in my mind that it improves outcomes for patients , recovery of urinary control is faster , blood loss is very very small , they 're not in hospital very long , `` Shayegan said . `` It 's a vast leap for patients . ''
But now St. Joe 's is dealing with a funding issue . The da Vinci came to Hamilton with a philanthropic donation of $ 2.3 million , but now it 's but up to the hospital to maintain . With the exception of Alberta , no Canadian provincial or territorial government helps with the cost of surgical robots .
Shayegan said it costs about $ 3500 more per surgery compared to a traditional procedure . They alone has done over a hundred surgeries with the robot since it came to the hospital , totaling to at least $ 350,000 . On top of that is a $ 180,000 annual maintenance cost .
`` So far , we 've had 100 per cent patient satisfaction , '' Shayegan said . `` I hope we can translate that into some funding . ''
US , Israel refuse to cooperate with inquest into Syria strike
Our investigative team is low on funds -- this story was paid for by reader donations . Just over 900 readers needed to close the gap !
UN nuclear watchdog has no evidence Syria had nuclear facility
The International Atomic Energy Agency - the United Nations nuclear watchdog - has not been able to conduct an investigation into the events surrounding the Sept. 6 Israeli bombing of a Syrian military installation because neither the Bush administration nor Israel are cooperating .
A diplomatic source close to the Vienna based IAEA told Raw Story that both the United States and Israel have been approached by the organization requesting supporting evidence of a nuclear reactor which media sources have cited , based on anonymous sources in both governments , as the reason for the Israeli strike .
The source also explained that the satellite footage , which the IAEA obtained through commercial channels for lack of any credible evidence ,  does not show a nuclear reactor in the early construction phase .
Another source , close to the IAEA , who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the topic , told RAW STORY last week that based on satellite imagery , evidence that `` it was nuclear related is shaky '' and pointed out that even basic security for such a facility - such as `` security fences '' - is missing .
Some IAEA experts have privately opined that the facility - located between the cities of Hama and Dayr az-Zawr in the Northeastern part of Syria - may have been `` no more than a workshop for the pumice mining industry along the banks of the Euphrates . ''
Both individuals independently confirmed that the IAEA can not conduct a formal investigation without the cooperation of either Israel or the United States , although both confirmed that the Syrian government is cooperating .
An IAEA spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Little is known about the attack
Little has been publicly revealed about the attack , which neither the US nor Israel has discussed . Israel did confirm in October that the bombing had taken place .
According to a report in the Guardian on Sept. 16 , `` Was Israeli to raid a dry run for an attack on Iran ? '' the Israeli air raid was substantial and was code-named Operation Orchard .
`` Far from being a minor incursion , the Israeli overflight of Syrian airspace through its ally , Turkey , was a far more major affair involving as many as eight aircraft , including Israel 's most ultra-modern F-15s and F-16s equipped with Maverick missiles and 500lb bombs , '' the paper alleged . `` Flying among the Israeli fighters at great height was an ELINT - an electronic intelligence gathering aircraft . ''
Although the mystery surrounding exactly what Israel hit in Syria continues , US intelligence sources have told RAW STORY it was not a nuclear armaments site . In late September , Vincent Cannistraro - Director of Intelligence Programs for the National Security Council under President Ronald Reagan and Chief of Operations at the Central Intelligence Agency 's Counterterrorism Center under President George H. W. Bush - told Raw Story that what the Israelis hit was `` absolutely not a nuclear weapons facility . ''
According to another intelligence official , US intelligence `` found no radiation signatures after the bombing , so there was no uranium or plutonium present . ''
`` We do n't have any independent intelligence that it was a nuclear facility - only the assertions by the Israelis and some ambiguous satellite photography from them that shows a building , which the Syrians admitted was a military facility , '' the source added .
The diplomat close to the IAEA also confirmed the lack of radiation signatures , but explained that a reactor still under construction would not yet be fully loaded with the necessary materials and would not therefore give off any radiation . The diplomat , however , again pointed to the satellite images , which do not show a nuclear reactor under construction in any case , explaining certain geometric configurations are necessary for such a facility , including certain height indicators as well as the lack of security such as armed guards .
Lawrence Wilkerson , former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell , said they do n't believe claims that the site contained nuclear weapons .
`` I 've heard so many versions of this story that I despair of ever knowing the real story , '' Wilkerson said in response to an email query . `` However , I do not believe that the real story , if it is ever known , will have anything at all to do with nuclear weapons . In short , I believe that [ former Bush UN ambassador John ] Bolton , [ Bush Deputy National Security Advisor Elliot ] Abrams , et al . are lying again . ''
Media reports diverge
Some intelligence officials have voiced strong criticism about alleged leaks to the press , which they say have distorted actual US and Israeli intelligence surrounding the strike . One US intelligence official identified the Office of the Vice President and those close to Vice President Dick Cheney by name .
`` The allegations that North Korea was helping to build a nuclear reactor have not been substantiated by US intelligence , '' said this intelligence official , adding , `` but that has n't stopped Dick Cheney and their minions at the NSC , Elliot Abrams and Steve Hadley , from leaking the information , which appears to be misleading in the extreme . ''
Claims of a Syrian nuclear weapons program have gone from the strange to the bizarre .
In mid-September , the Sunday Times reported that the Israelis had been planning the operation since the spring of this year , after learning that Syria was attempting to buy a nuclear device from North Korea , and that at the time of the airstrike on Sept. 6 , the Israelis had managed to blow apart a `` Syrian nuclear cache . ''
Former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton told the Times that they were worried about `` North Korea and Iran outsourcing their nuclear programmes . ''
In late September , the Times reported again that Israeli commandos had descended on the facility and obtained samples of nuclear materials .
Yet on Sept. 17 , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made what appeared to be a bizarre statement , considering the level of nuclear hysteria surrounding the Syrian incident .
`` We want to make peace with everyone , '' Olmert said . `` If the conditions allow for it , we are ready to make peace with Syria without preset conditions and without ultimatums . ''
An October report on the ABC News website alleged that Mossad - Israeli intelligence - had either directly infiltrated the nuclear facility or turned a Syrian agent , and were thus able to acquire detailed photographs of the building , although no samples of nuclear materials were mentioned .
Also in October , the New York Times reported that a `` partially constructed '' nuclear reactor had been hit , although details `` remain unclear , '' and the veracity of the intelligence , which was based entirely on satellite imagery , was also uncertain . There was no mention of spies infiltrating the facility or commandos obtaining samples of nuclear materials .
By Nov. 2 , the `` partially constructed '' nuclear reactor had morphed into a `` suspected nuclear site '' bombed by the United States , not Israel , with tactical nuclear weapons . This was reported by Arabic news agency , Al Jazeera , and then picked up by the Jerusalem Post .
Some have pointed to Syria 's chemical weapons program as the likely target , and alleged attempts by Syria to weaponize a chemical warhead as the likely reason for the air raid . Yet the secrecy and ever-changing stories from all three governments continue to obscure what actually occurred on September 6 . Coupled with the lack of cooperation from the US and Israel with the IAEA , there is little chance the mystery will soon be unraveled . What is known , however , is that no type of nuclear reactor or nuclear facility was hit , despite the many anonymous leaks to the press .

Turkey has vowed to `` completely cleanse '' Islamic State militants from its border region , after a suspected suicide bomber with links to the group killed 54 people , including 22 children , at a Kurdish wedding .
Turkey has vowed to `` completely cleanse '' Islamic State militants from its border region , after a suspected suicide bomber with links to the group killed 54 people , including 22 children , at a Kurdish wedding .
Saturday 's attack in the southeastern city of Gaziantep is the deadliest in Turkey this year . It was carried out by a suicide bomber aged between 12 and 14 , President Tayyip Erdoğan said on Sunday , adding that initial evidence pointed to Islamic State .
A senior security official said the device used was the same type as those employed in the July 2015 suicide attack in the border town of Suruc and the October 2015 suicide bombing of a rally of pro-Kurdish activists in Ankara .
Both of those attacks were blamed on Islamic State . The group has targeted Kurdish gatherings in an apparent effort to further inflame ethnic tensions strained by a long Kurdish insurgency . The Ankara bombing was the deadliest of its kind in Turkey , killing more than 100 people .
`` Daesh should be completely cleansed from our borders and we are ready to do what it takes for that , '' Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a news conference in Ankara , using an Arabic name for the group .
A senior rebel official said Turkish-backed Syrian rebels were preparing to launch an attack to seize the Syrian town of Jarablus from Islamic State on the border with Turkey , a move that would deny control to advancing Syrian Kurdish fighters .
The rebels , groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army , were expected to assault Jarablus from inside Turkey in the next few days . TV footage showed around 10 Turkish tanks deployed at a village around 4 km ( 2.5 miles ) from the border gate immediately across from Jarablus . It was not clear how long the tanks had been there .
Prime Minister Binali Yilidirm has said Turkey would take a more active role in Syria in the next six months to prevent the country from being divided along ethnic lines .
Cavusoglu said Turkey , a member of Nato and the US-led coalition against Islamic State , had become the `` number one target '' for the militants because of its work to stop recruits traveling through Turkey across its over 800km border into Syria to join the Sunni hardline group .
For Ankara , Islamic State is not the only threat lurking across its frontier . Turkey is also concerned that attempts by Syrian Kurds to extend their control along the common border could add momentum to an insurgency by Kurds on its own territory .
Dogan news agency said the death toll in the Gaziantep bombing had risen yesterday to 54 after three more people died . Sixty-six were being treated in hospital , 14 in serious condition .
Disaster
For five years fighting has raged in Syria - a humanitarian disaster destabilising the region and the world . The aim of Bashar al-Assad 's opponents ' always was to drive the Syrian leader from power , but they have lacked the means to dislodge him . Now an inflection point may be at hand , with powerful opposition backer Turkey suggesting Assad , despite their brutality in the war , could play a role in an unspecified transition period .
The statement Saturday by Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was nuanced : On one hand , `` Assad does not appear to be someone who can bring ( Syrians ) together '' - but on the other , `` there may be talks ( with Assad ) for the transition '' .
Until now , Syria 's neighbour to the north was determined to see them out of power - providing refuge and supply lines for a variety of Syrian rebel groups and turning something of a blind eye to the use of its territory by Islamic State jihadis waging their own fight with Assad as well .
The attack comes with Turkey still shaken just a month after the government survived an attempted coup by rogue military officers , which Ankara blames on US-based Islamist preacher Fethullah Gulen . ­Gulen denies the charge .
Turkish authorities have said a destroyed suicide vest was found at the scene of the bombing . A second security official said that they were investigating the possibility militants could have placed the explosives on the child without their or their knowledge and detonated them remotely , or that a mentally disabled child was duped into carrying the device , a tactic seen elsewhere in the region .

District 9 Director Neil Blomkamp Confirms Studio Already Wants Sequel
Scifimoviepage.com had an exclusive interview with Neil Blomkamp , the impressive newcomer who directed the Peter Jackson produced alien flick , “ District 9. ” In the interview , Blomkamp said that SONY is already asking for a sequel .
District 9 takes place in Johannesburg , South Africa – where aliens have landed some time ago , and the humans have forced them into camps to live . The film has a great story , and the idea is truly original as far as alien movies go . And the visual effects are incredible for the budget that they had – only $ 30 million for the entire movie . Peter Jackson 's FX company , WETA , is responsible for the special effects in the film which are top notch .

From scifimoviepage.com —
Feel that District 9 , the Peter Jackson-produced sci-fi box office hit about alien refugees in Johannesburg , South Africa being made to live in squatter camps has too much of an open-ended ending ? Then do n't fear . According to director Neill Blomkamp the studio already “ wants ” a sequel !
And who can blame them ? Boasting some impressive special effects by Jackson 's WETA outfit , District 9 was made for a mere $ 30 million and has already scored an impressive $ 37.4 million at the US box office over the weekend making it the number one hit , edging out GI Joe : Rise of Cobra to the number two spot in the process . ( In contrast the budget for GI Joe was rumored to be $ 170 million ! )
In an exclusive interview on August 18th , 2009 with The Sci-Fi Movie Page , the director admitted that they were already joking about “ District 10 ” !
Even though they wrote District 9 with no sequel in mind , Blomkamp admits that they have “ an inclination of an idea ” for one and would definitely be interested in directing the sequel .
Although it is obviously early days , this talented 29-year-old South African-born director who worked in advertising before making their directorial debut with District 9 dropped some tantalizing hints : It would seem that Blomkamp is more interested in it being a sequel than a prequel , which would again be set in South Africa and star Sharlto Copley as Wikus van der Merwe again . “ Does Wikus become human again ? ” is one of the plot issues which Blomkamp feels can be explored in a possible sequel .
That does n't mean that Blomkamp is ruling out a prequel . They admitted that they find van der Merwe 's character to be “ hilarious ” and more fascinating before their redemption in the movie . District 9-star Sharlto Copley who plays van der Merwe echoes these sentiments and says he 'd love to play a younger version of the character .
In their interview Blomkamp speaks candidly about their experiences on the Halo movie which they were supposed to have directed with Peter Jackson ( Lord of the Rings , King Kong ) producing , noting that their involvement in the project is “ dead ” and that they probably would n't direct it even if someone asked them to . They did however add that they would like to see Spielberg make it into a movie , depending on who they get to direct it of course .
They tell that $ 11 million were spent on preproduction costs before the Halo movie were canned and that they even did research on topics such as whether handguns would actually fire in outer space . ( The answer , surprisingly , is yes . )
Next up for the director when they get back to Vancouver is ( you guessed it ) a sci-fi project , which is in its very early stages . Unlike District 9 this one will be set on a “ different planet , way in the future. ” Will Peter Jackson be involved ? Blomkamp ca n't say , adding that The Hobbit is keeping the famed New Zealand director very busy right now . But they add that Jackson will definitely be involved with any District 9 sequel .

Sci-fi Movie Page webmaster James O'Ehley has the following to say about their interview with Blomkamp : Blomkamp is an exciting new talent in Hollywood , or at least Canada then . ( The director moved to Canada from South Africa at age 18 . )
Unlike the Baby Boomers such as Spielberg and Lucas and fortysomethingers such as Peter Jackson himself , Blomkamp only turns 30 later this year , which means that they grew up with a totally different set of influences than many of the directors and creative people who has dominated genre output in Hollywood over the past few decades . To illustrate : Peter Jackson may have been hugely influenced by watching the original 1930s Black & White King Kong on television one night , but the chances are that a youngster such as Blomkamp with easier access to DVDs and videogames would instead be influenced by the likes of Spielberg , James Cameron and instead .
One can see the influence of several ‘ Eighties movies in District 9 : Wikus ( Sharlto Copley ) pulling off their fingernails like Jeff Goldblum did in David Cronenberg 's 1986 remake of The Fly and the Robocop-inspired ultraviolence of the movie 's climax in itself which people get literally blown apart by alien weaponry . The premise behind District 9 is taken from a 1988 movie titled Alien Nation .
Blomkamp is “ one of us ” , by which I mean that they love movies and they love science fiction . When I showed them a copy of Fantastique , the newly-launched English version of the long-running French print magazine I also work for , they eagerly asked me if they could keep my copy . ( How could we refuse him ? ) Our interview was all too brief as we touched on anything from George Lucas ' expectations of the original Star Wars ( he was convinced that it would flop ! ) to how Hollywood often gets science just plain wrong in their movies .
Blomkamp believes that if we were to really make contact with aliens one day , it would be on their terms not ours . After all , anyone who has the technology to travel millions of light years to our planet would n't let themselves be shoved into squatter camps . Maybe he 'll make a documentary about how Hollywood gets science wrong , the young director mused . It does n't matter what they make . We will be the first in the row to go see it !
Everyone here at ReviewSTL loved “ District 9. ” I think I can safely say that we are all excited to see what happens with the next film – whether it be a sequel or prequel . If you have n't seen “ District 9 ” yet – go see it today ! !

After drafting Dante Exum with the No . 5 pick in the 2014 NBA Draft , the Utah Jazz 's new project struggled mightily on the offensive end of the floor during their rookie season .
Exum turned the ball over at almost three times the rate that they drew free throws , they posted one of the lowest usage percentages in the league for a guard and they shot only 12.5 percent of their total field goal attempts within three feet of the basket . Then , in the summer heading into their sophomore season , Exum tore their ACL while representing the Australian National Team . After an abysmal rookie season coupled with a devastating injury , what was supposed to be a bright NBA career was off to a shaky start .
Now , fast forward to Exum 's current season—where Quin Snyder 's approach to Exum 's development has not been a secret . With George Hill , Shelvin Mack , Raul Neto and Alec Burks able to play minutes at the point guard position , Exum has not seen nearly the same treatment or playing time that they did in their rookie campaign . As Ben Dowsett of Basketball Insiders explains , Snyder 's leash on Exum has been ridiculously short . Any mistake from Exum is followed by an immediate benching , sometimes for a game at a time .
But in recent games , flashes of brilliance have become more common for Exum . Suddenly , an apparent shift in Exum 's mindset has provided a glimpse into the end result of Utah 's highly touted draft prospect .
Calling it a “ coming out party ” or a “ turning point ” may seem extreme , but something seemed to click for Exum in a game against the Charlotte Hornets earlier this month . In the contest , they drove the lane confidently and aggressively , a style of play that Jazz fans are n't used to seeing from their young guard .
In the past few weeks , Exum has maintained this willingness to attack off the dribble and in transition , uncovering the types of skills that had been hiding behind Exum 's limited aggression . One of Exum 's go-to moves is a John Wall favorite , lulling their defender to sleep and then executing a quick crossover to blow by the defender . They use this move to beat Brian Roberts on this play , although they are subsequently rejected by Marvin Williams at the rim . The most important part of this play is n't necessarily the initial move—it 's more so Exum 's willingness to go up for the ambitious dunk attempt .
Against the Portland Trail Blazers , Exum 's displayed what they can do if they are willing to take on defenders aerially . They catch the ball on the move , takes one hard dribble towards the rim and then and explodes upwards in order to cram it on Noah Vonleh 's head .
Additionally , Exum utilizes a nifty inside-out move to beat on-ball defenders . They fake a right-to-left crossover here to beat Kemba Walker off of the dribble . Then , they eurosteps Miles Plumlee at the rim , hitting a difficult and off-balanced lefty shot .
Once Exum breaks down the initial defender , it 's easy to see how their strides make them so effective with the ball . Along with the eurostep , Exum can also use their long strides in straight line drives to the basket . Here , Exum picks up their dribble before even getting inside the painted area , but they are still is able to penetrate all the way to the bucket .
Exum 's long strides are evident in the transition game as well . Although he 's no Giannis Antetokounmpo , they can provide a needed change of pace for the slowest team in the league . In Utah 's bench lineups , Exum and Burks come at the throats of transition defenses like two Tasmanian Devils .
As Exum becomes a more experienced slasher , it will be important for them to learn the optimal type of finish given the circumstances . Sometimes , Exum is caught in between whether or not to use the backboard or they fail to identify the correct finishing angle in order to limit a rim protector 's ability to alter the shot .
Furthermore , Exum needs to increase their understanding of the reads necessary once they drive . With their length and athleticism , there will certainly be opportunities for them to finish around or over a help defender . On the other hand , there will be times when they need to kick it out to shooters on the perimeter or to a big man cutting on the baseline to avoid over-penetration .
However , to learn these reads , the first step for Exum is their willingness to drive hard to the basket . In other words , Exum must get into the lane before he 's able to learn the proper reads they need to make from within the lane . If Exum can continue to find their way to the bucket , these types of reads will become easier for them to execute .
On the play below , Exum makes a read that is common for any comfortable playmaker . First , Exum escapes Jrue Holiday with a spin move , and then they dump it down to Gobert when Anthony Davis commits to helping .
And Exum is already making some of these high-level reads as the pick-and-roll ball handler . Here , Exum notices Troy Daniels tagging Boris Diaw 's roll from the weakside corner . To counteract this , Exum swings an incredibly accurate crosscourt pass to Rodney Hood for the 3-pointer .
Because Exum boasts the tools to shoot over bigger players , knowing when and how to attack the opposing pick-and-roll big is another crucial step in their progression . They are becoming more comfortable using a floater in this tweener range between the free throw line and the basket , a perfect finesse shot that they can pair with more ferocious dunk attempts .
Ultimately , the Jazz are in a tough situation . On one hand , Utah is 35-22 and the team seems ready to make in the upcoming playoffs . On the other hand , the Jazz possess a young guard who needs time ( and mistakes ) to develop . However , if Exum can continue to transform their tools into on-court production like they have over the past few weeks , then those two realities may be able to coexist .

Barstool Sports ' Dan `` Big Cat '' Katz tweeted an image of a `` Fire Gar/Pax '' T-shirt sold on the company 's site with the caption , `` BUY BUY BUY . '' `` I hate you @ chicagobulls '' Katz also tweeted . And also : `` I love Taj but they could 've been dealt any time the last 2 years for more . ''
Several fans on the Bulls Reddit community had already planned to wear a different version of a `` Fire GarPax '' shirt at the Bulls ' nationally televised game against the Clippers on March 4 . `` # FireGarPax . Movement just got 10 feet taller , '' shirt designer alba7or posted on Reddit Thursday .
Daniel Greenberg of @ ChiSportUpdates created a fan petition on petitionbuzz.com calling for Forman 's and Paxson 's ouster .
`` Bulls fans it 's time to stand up and let our voices be heard , '' they wrote . `` We deserve better . The Bulls front office is ridiculous . Things need to change . We need to stand up for what we believe in . Please sign the petition to help try to make a difference with the Chicago Bulls . Sign it to let the Bulls organization know that we have had enough . We are not happy with the way Gar Forman and John Paxson are running the Chicago Bulls . ''
`` It 's an absolute shame and embarrassment that these two still have their jobs . Unbelievable , '' the Chicago sports blogger later tweeted .

No charges for man who shot teens 65-year-old city man acted in self-defense in killing , wounding of teens , DA says Related Articles State law allows deadly force for self-protection

Reading Eagle : Bill Uhrich Cumru Township Police Chief Jed Habecker , left , and Berks County District Attorney John T. Adams on Thursday discuss the fatal shooting , ruled justifiable , of a teenager by a would-be robbery victim .
The teens , age 16 and 15 , and another 15-year-old boy skipped school Wednesday and robbed two pedestrians in West Reading before they attacked the man as they rode on the Thun Trail in Cumru Township at 11 a.m. , police said .
The man , whose name authorities withheld , will not be charged for shooting the teens because they acted in self-defense , which is legal under Pennsylvania 's Castle Doctrine , District Attorney John T. Adams said .
`` While I do n't condone violence , the bike rider had no choice , '' Adams said . `` It was justifiable homicide . ''
Julius Johnson , 16 , of Reading was pronounced dead at the scene Wednesday morning after they were shot in their chest with a handgun , officials said .
An autopsy Thursday by Dr. Supriya Kuruvila , a forensic pathologist at Reading Hospital , determined Johnson died of a gunshot wound to the chest , according to the county coroner 's office . The death was ruled a homicide , officials said .
The 15-year-old shot in the neck remained in Reading Hospital on Thursday , officials said . Information about their medical condition could not be obtained . Police did not release their name because they have not been charged .
The third teen , Michael Gonzalez , 15 , address unavailable , was charged with robbery , aggravated assault and related offenses and committed to the county youth center in Bern Township .
Officials said an investigation continues .
Johnson was a Reading High School student , and the 15-year-olds are Gov . Mifflin High School students , Adams said .
Adams gave this account :
Johnson was on probation for previous offenses . Juvenile probation officers had gone to their Oakbrook residence earlier Wednesday and found the three teens playing video games .
They told the two 15-year-olds to leave . The officers put an electronic monitoring device on Johnson 's ankle , ordered them to stay home and report to their office with their parents at 4 p.m .
Instead , the three met up and decided to jump and rob random victims .
They first robbed an elderly man in West Reading shortly after 10 a.m. , taking money from their pockets , then tried to rob another man in West Reading , kneeing them in the stomach and pushing them to the ground . Neither man was hurt .
The bike rider was on the trail between Reading and West Reading .
As they rode past the teens , the 15-year-old whose name was not released punched the man in the face , knocking them from their bike . Johnson ran and kicked the man , who was sitting against a chain-link fence along the trail .
As one of the teens ran toward the man , they shot Johnson and the 15-year-old .
People who found the man called 9-1-1 and waited for police to arrive . It was unclear if the people heard the shots or were on the trail .
The teens were n't armed , but the shootings were legal because the man was unable to escape , thought their life was in danger and had a permit to carry their gun , Adams said .
The man told investigators : `` I was scared for my life . I was in big trouble . If I could have kept my bike on the trail , I would have gotten out of there . ''
The man was unhurt but shaken by the shootings , Adams said .
Adams did not know if Johnson 's monitoring device had GPS tracking capabilities or if it simply triggered an alarm when they left their home . Adams said juvenile probation officers acted appropriately .
Cumru Police Chief Jed Habecker credited their department for its quick investigation .
They said the crime was only the second robbery to occur along the Cumru section of the Thun Trail in about a decade .
Adams said they have heard from many people in the community that the bicyclist was a hero for successfully defending himself .
`` When your life is in danger , you have no choice but to use deadly force , '' they said .

In a Budget day surprise , the Chancellor earmarked the cash for spending on tighter border controls and other measures to prepare the country for `` any outcome '' in the negotiations over leaving the bloc . And they signalled that Britain will not put up with Brussels bullying as negotiations over the exit from the EU reach a `` critical phase '' . `` No one should doubt our resolve ! '' they said . Mr Hammond 's extra cash for Brexit preparations over the next two year was a key measure in a £25billion Budget spending splurge designed to get Britain `` fit for the future . ''
Philip Hammond has earmarked £3bn for spending on border controls and Brexit related preparations
Following intense speculation about their position , the Chancellor loosened the Treasury purse strings to lavish cash on measures to tackle a string of challenges facing the country . Mr Hammond scrapped Stamp Duty for first-time buyers purchasing properties worth under £300,000 in a radical move . New measures costing more than £15billion to encourage housebuilding to ease the homes shortage were also unveiled . And they announced an extra £7billion for the NHS over the next five years , promised pay rises for nurses and poured cash into benefits to ease the introduction of the new Universal Credit system .
The Chancellor has also earmarked an extra £7bn for the NHS over the next 5 years
But their extra £3billion for Brexit contingency planning , on top of £700million previously pledged by the Government , surprised Tory MPs who had feared the Chancellor was resisting pressure to make preparations for a `` no deal '' outcome in the floundering Brexit talks . In their Budget speech , Mr Hammond vowed that the Government was doing everything necessary `` to embrace change , to meet those challenges head on and to seize those opportunities for Britain . '' Making progress in the Brexit negotiations , ahead of a crunch deadline next month , was the Government 's `` top priority , '' the Chancellor said . `` The negotiations on our future relationship with the EU are in a critical phase , '' they said .
Their remarks followed confirmation that Theresa May will meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on December 4 for talks ahead of a crunch EU Summit later in the month . Announcing the £3billion war chest , the Chancellor added : `` I stand ready to allocate further sums if and when needed . No one should doubt are resolve . '' Treasury officials said the cash – separate from the expected multi-billion EU divorce payment - will be available for the Home Office and other Whitehall departments to make necessary preparations for the UK fully cutting ties with Brussels . Brexit campaigners welcomed the Chancellor 's move last night .
The government had previously pledged £700m for Brexit contingency planning
Richard Tice , co-chairperson of the pressure group Leave Means Leave , said : “ After months of applying pressure on the Chancellor to acknowledge the economic benefits of Brexit , we are pleased they have finally taken our advice . “ This is the first time the Chancellor has had anything positive to say about Brexit and it is a small step in the right direction . However more must be done . '' Mr Hammond announced that the cash to fund their £25billion of public spending measures will come from cash set aside by the Treasury in previous years rather than tax rises or increased Government borrowing . And their spending pledges were announced in spite of a drastic downgrading of forecasts for economic growth over the next five years from the Office for Budget Responsibility .
Poor productivity would mean Britain 's national output ( GDP ) would only grow by 1.5 % this year rather than 2 % predicted in March , the official financial watchdog said . Mr Hammond announced an extra £8billion for their National Productivity Investment Fund - raising the total to £31billion - to try to tackle the productivity crisis and accelerate growth . They declared that their Budget would lay the foundations for a `` global Britain '' after Brexit `` where talent and hard work are rewarded , where the dream of home ownership is a reality for all generations , a hub of enterprise and innovation , a beacon of creativity , a civilised and tolerant place that cares for the vulnerable and nurtures the talented , an outward looking , free-trading nation , a force for good in the world . '' Their Budget was a `` balanced '' package to set the economy `` on a path to a new relationship with our European neighbours and a new future outside the EU , '' Mr Hammond said .
Budget 2017 : Key points Thu , November 23 , 2017 Britain 's Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has delivered their budget for 2017 Play slideshow 1 of 13
Concluding their hour-long speech , they added : `` We are at a turning point in our history and we resolve to look forwards not backwards , to build on the strengths of the British economy , to embrace change not hide from it , to seize the opportunities ahead of us and , together , build a Britain fit for the future . '' Mr Hammond 's speech was enthusiastically cheered by Tory MPs in the Commons . Backbench sources thought the measures would help to ease the pressure on the Chancellor following speculation they could be sacked in a New Year reshuffle .
Last Monday night , HighHeatStats tweeted the following :
High Heat Stats ‏ @ HighHeatStats Boxscore Trivia ( difficulty 4 out of 5 ) : what happened most recently in this 1995 game ? http : //www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU199507250.shtml …
In attempting to answer the question , I misread the boxscore and this conversation ensued :
dianagram ‏ @ dianagram intentionally walking the pitcher ?
But it got me wondering if there had ever been an intentional walk of a pitcher . With the Baseball Reference Play Index Event Finder fired up , I found these nine occurrences since 1945 ( as far back as the Event Finder goes , with the caveat that IBBs were not an officially-tracked statistic until 1955 ) :
Schoolboy Rowe could really handle themselves at the plate . As a 22-year-old in A-ball in 1932 , they hit .295 and smacked ten homers in 112 at-bats , while also going 19-7 on the mound with a 1.094 WHIP . In 1943 , at the age of 33 , they hit .294/.390/.510 in 59 plate appearances as a pinch-hitter , to go along with a .304/.385/.420 rate in games they actually started at pitcher .
In the 1946 Rowe IBB event , the next batter , Roy Hughes , was a career .278 hitter to that point . Hughes was making their season debut in what would be their final year in the bigs . They grounded into a forceout at third , sending the game to extras . Rowe pitched all 11 innings , eventually losing 3-2 .
Rowe 's two IBBs in 1947 came in the same game . They had been hitting a robust .317/.369/.400 in 66 PAs for the season . After the first IBB , rookie shortstop Ralph LaPointe came up . LaPointe had a .212/.316/.242 line in the first 13 games of their young career . They flied out to center , ending the second inning . Two innings later , Rowe 's IBB was followed by LaPointe hitting a flyball to right , again ending the inning . Rowe would again pitch a complete game , losing 8-1 .
Fred Hutchinson was also a standout hitter in the minors , batting .349 with four homers in 361 at-bats . Their two-way skills on the field were best described here , by himself :
Playing outfield as much they pitched , they told The Sporting News , “ When the war is over , I want a real try for about three or four years just to see whether or not I really can pitch major league ball . If I ca n't pitch , and if I 'm not too old , then I 'd like to try it in the outfield . … I like to hit that ball , you know , but I like to throw it , too . It 's a lot of fun to fool a smart batter . ”
Going into the September 20 , 1947 contest , Hutchinson had compiled a .305/.340/.463 line with only six strikeouts in 100 plate appearances . With opposing starter Bob Feller still on the mound in the bottom of the tenth inning on a 2-2 game , the Indians elected to walk Hutchinson with one out and a runner on second . Doc Cramer ( batting .271 on the year ) was sent up to pinch-hit for .215-hitting Eddie Lake . Cramer reached on an error by 3B Ken Keltner . Eddie Mayo then ended the game with a single to right , making a winner out of Hutchinson .
From 1948 to 1956 , Mickey McDermott had established themselves as a decent innings-eater and an adept batter . In 1957 , as their career was winding down and they found themselves playing for their fourth different team in five years , they brought a batting line of .257/.312/.339 to the plate . On May 12th , they made one of only four starts on the mound for the year , in the first game of a double-header . Manager Lou Boudreau batted McDermott eighth , in front of weak-hitting Joe DeMaestri . Interestingly DeMaestri , who had compiled a career line of .238/.275/.323 prior to the '57 seasons , was hitting .352/.426/.444 in their first 21 games of 1957 ( but they HAD gone hitless in at least their last 15 ABs ) . In the top of the fourth , down 2-0 with one out and runners on second and third , the Indians decided to have Early Wynn walk McDermott ( even though Wynn K'ed McDermott the time before ) , to load the bases . Boudreau moved to pinch-hit for DeMaestri with Irv Noren . Noren had been part of one of those notorious Kansas City/Yankees trades of the mid-50s .
Noren was trying to bounce back from a bad year in '56 , but was a career .278 hitter coming into the season . In this particular at-bat , Noren grounded into a 3-6 forceout , scoring a run . Vic Power ended the inning with a foulout , and McDermott tired in their half of the inning , getting pulled after yielding two singles and two walks , but still holding a 3-1 lead . The Athletics went onto a 9-2 win .
Lou Sleater was a swingman for most of their early career , before settling into the bullpen in 1955 at the age of 28 . As a hitter , through 1956 , they had compiled a .197/.228/.224 line in 79 plate appearances . On May 30 , 1957 Sleater launched their first career homer , a tenth-inning walkoff game-winner versus Wally Burnette . It was only the second extra-inning walkoff homer hit by a pitcher in Play Index history ( 1945 forward ) .
In the July 14 game , the Tigers rallied in the bottom of the ninth to tie the score on a one-out double by Reno Bertoia . The Orioles elected to have reliever George Zuverink intentionally walk Sleater to set up the double-play/force possibility , and pitch instead to a normally terrific but at that point slumping Harvey Kuenn ( .255/.330/.366 to that point in the season ) . Kuenn never did hit Zuverink well , and this time they fouled out . The following batter also fouled out , but the Tigers eventually won the game in 10 .
Juan Pizarro had an 18-year career in the bigs , but they were only 21 and in their second season in the Majors in 1958 . They were pretty decent with the bat too , compiling a .250/.263/.361 line in their rookie season ( 1957 ) . They happened to be making their 1958 season debut on July 25th , and pitched a complete game nine-hitter . Trailing 3-1 with two out and a runner on second in the sixth inning , the Cubs had reliever Don Elston walk Pizarro . For what its worth , Pizarro had singled off of Elston the last time they faced each other back in '57 . Behind Pizarro was the leadoff man Casey Wise ( and why they were batting leadoff would be a question for sabermetricians to lose sleep over ) . Wise came into this game batting .077 ( 1-13 ) for the year , after a rookie 1957 campaign that saw them amass a line of .179/.256/.226 in 118 plate appearances , including .179/.236/.239 when batting leadoff . Anyhow , in this game , Wise hit a flyball to center , ending the inning . The Braves won the game 4-1 .
Jim “ Kitty ” Kaat was a 25-year Major Leaguer who won 283 games and was also a 16-time AL Gold Glove winner ( every year from '62 to '77 ) . Kaat had some pop in their bat too , cranking out 11 homers and 28 doubles in just under 800 at-bats from 1959-1969 . They even posted a .615 OPS in 1969 . They were having a bit of a down year at the plate in 1970 ( .197/.260/.212 ) prior to the September 1 game of note . In the game , Kaat was called on to preserve a 1-0 lead with two out and runners on first and second in the bottom of the ninth . Ted Kubiak singled off of them to tie the game , and Kaat continued to pitch in the extras .
In the top of the 11th , with the Twins already having taken a 2-1 lead with runners on second and third with one out , the Brewers had reliever Bobby Bolin walk Kaat to load the bases for Cesar Tovar . They wanted/needed a double play in the worst way . Tovar did n't get doubled up that often , usually less than ten times per year , and they had the speed for 11 triples and 24 stolen bases to that point in 1970 . Tovar foiled the Brewers ' plan with a two-run single to left , and the Twins eventually scored six in the frame , for a 7-1 win .
It took another 34 years for a pitcher to be intentionally walked , and Brooks Kieschnick got the honor/respect . Kieschnick was quite the stud/enigma during their career , beginning with their college ledger :
During their time with the Texas Longhorns , Kieschnick won the Dick Howser Trophy ( bestowed annually to the national college baseball player of the year ) [ 4 ] in 1992 . [ 5 ] They won the award again in 1993 , thus becoming the only player to win the honor twice . [ 6 ] In their three years with the Longhorns , Kieschnick batted .360 and slugged 43 home runs and 215 runs batted in , in addition to having a 34–8 win–loss record and a 3.05 ERA .
They were drafted by the Cubs as an outfielder in 1993 and finally got their call to The Show in 1996 . They got a little playing time in '96 and '97 ( compiling a .235/.321/.395 line ) before spending '98 and '99 back in the minors . They made the Majors as a 1B and PH for a cup of coffee in 2000 with the Reds , moved onto the Rockies for a few ABs in 2001 , and then back to the minors . It was at that point they switched over to pitching full-time . When they got back to the Majors in 2003 with the Brewers , they made three starts in left field , four at DH and relieved 42 times from the pen .
In 2004 , they were the rare “ reliever/pinch-hitter ” . Coming into the May 5 contest , they were hitting .313/.353/.500 in 17 PAs . In their last at-bat against the Reds on April 28 , they hit a pinch-hit single . The Reds remembered that as the top of the ninth unfolded in a 4-4 game . With one out and a runner on second , Cincinnati had its reliever Danny Graves walk Kieschnick . The only prior time Graves had pitched to Kieschnick ( 2001 ) , Kieschnick hit into a double play . The Reds chose to instead pitch to Scott Podsednick
After hitting .309/.387/.500 in the first 22 games of the 2004 season , Podesdnik was just beginning to start the slump that defined a disappointing sophomore campaign after finishing second in the NL Rookie of the Year vote in 2003 . Blessed with great speed ( he was 14-for-14 in steal attempts coming into the game ) , they are n't much of a double play threat , but Graves got them to rap into a 4-6-3 inning-ender . The Reds would win the game with a walkoff homer in the 10th from pinch-hitter Juan Castro .
And that 's the last time a pitcher has received a free pass . . . nine times in nearly 70 seasons , and only seven pitchers have gotten such a ride . Let 's hope its not another 30 years before we see the tenth instance .
TRENTON -- Live from Trenton , it 's ... Joe Piscopo ?
The former `` Saturday Night Live '' star met with Gov . Chris Christie at the Statehouse on Thursday to discuss the idea of running for governor next year , according to a report by PolitickerNJ .
Piscopo , now a radio show host , is a former Democrat and now an independent but they would run as a Republican , the report said , citing unnamed sources .
Piscopo attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July , mingling with New Jersey 's delegation .
Christie 's office did not return a message late Thursday seeking comment .
Ciattarelli vows to be different than Christie
This is n't the first time Piscopo , 65 , has flirted with a run . They considered one in 2004 .
Piscopo was raised in North Caldwell and now lives in Lebanon Township in Hunterdon County .
They made their name in the early 1980s as a `` SNL '' cast member , often pairing with a young Eddie Murphy .
Experts expect Democrats to win back the governor 's office , with Christie 's approval ratings at all-time lows . Former banking executive Phil Murphy is considered the front-runner .
The Republican primary , meanwhile , could be a crowded affair . State Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli ( R-Somerset ) and business person Joseph Rullo are the only declared candidates , though Lt. Gov . Kim Guadagno is expected to launch a bid and Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick ( R-Union ) has n't ruled out running .

College hockey continues to grow in notoriety and popularity across the country , with each new season bringing increased talent , competition , and following . With that , athletic departments are increasing their school 's footprint on social , in efforts to continue growing the sport at the NCAA level . Check out which programs are bringing their A-games for everyone 's favorite part — the goal celebration !
Boston College
When it comes to social media and graphic design , the BC 's team knows how to get the job done . The goal graphic has that ‘ wow ' factor , with creative motion and design that shifts the point of visual in a fun , eye-catching way . This is just one example of tremendous graphic work coming from the Eagles , with content being strong across most of their sports .
Vermont
# VCATS GOAL ! Ross Colton opens up the scoring just 5:42 in to the game to take the 1-0 lead ! pic.twitter.com/vQ8xAGt2sK — UVM Men 's Hockey ( @ UVMmhockey ) November 26 , 2016
The Catamounts have been a pleasant surprise in Hockey East this season , and their social team has followed suit . I love how dynamic the graphic is in incorporating the perfect amount of design and motion , while maintaining a consistent look . The arena in the background is a nice touch .
Penn State
Another goal this time it 's Kerr with their second of the season making the score 5-0 at 16:14 of the first period # WeAre # HockeyValley pic.twitter.com/lYNDnlEbdb — Penn State Men 's Hockey ( @ PennStateMHKY ) November 19 , 2016
Penn State has taken college hockey by storm , quickly rising to one of the nation 's premier programs . Their goal graphic is simple and subtle , but the program is anything but . It 's nice to see the social team incorporating a fun aspect to their graphic , with the players showing their personality in a quick hit clip . Keeping it light-hearted has proven to do well on social ,
Northeastern
Northeastern , the reigning Hockey East champs , also have a smooth , sharp looking graphic in a complimentary design . The player transitions well with the name and marketing slogan , and I like how the ‘ GOAL ' flashes to catch a follower 's eye . This is a perfect example of how effective graphics can be , without overdoing it .
Omaha
And another one ! ! Two in 14 seconds . pic.twitter.com/QkvtmSgxBP — Omaha Hockey ( @ OmahaHKY ) November 27 , 2016
Omaha does its goal graphics right . This has all of the best elements needed for a successful scoring GIF in college hockey : sharp design , dynamic movement , and an almost announcer like presentation of the scorer 's information . This gives followers everything they need to know and an in-game quality announcement .
Dartmouth
Troy Crema nets their 3rd of the year ! Makes it 2-0 on the PP at 6:54 of the 1st . pic.twitter.com/HbjesPqy34 — Dartmouth Hockey ( @ Dartmouth_MIH ) November 27 , 2016
This video is clever from Dartmouth 's social team , with the highlight of the goal featured within the jersey body of the player . This adds a cool layer of video to content that has varying degrees of motion . It 's a unique take on presentation , and it works , so I give credit to the team for trying something unconventional .
Wisconsin
Max Zimmer makes it 5-3 . 16:26 left in the third . pic.twitter.com/SZMnHwN97t — Wisconsin Hockey ( @ BadgerMHockey ) November 27 , 2016
The Badgers show us how those green-screen promo shoots at the beginning of the season can be put to work . Even simple movements can bring a graphic to life , and the other relatively static information is a good contrast with the player movement . Subtle but satisfying .
Army
2:36 2nd | ARMY GOAL !
Evancho carries it up the ice and slots it top right on a 3-v-2 breakaway # GoArmy pic.twitter.com/zogqTpuRIF — Army WP Hockey ( @ ArmyWP_Hockey ) November 20 , 2016
Army hockey may not be the prototypical college hockey program , but they definitely deserve our salute for their dedication and commitment to not only the sport , but our country . West Point 's social team gets credit for owning the gold and black color scheme , while adding that motion aspect that just adds a little bit of ‘ pop ' .
Michigan State
The Spartans provide us another example of having fun with their social presence , with their player video animations unorthodox and funny . This may seem silly , but connecting with fans to show a player 's personality builds a stronger understanding and sentiment than normal . How can you not love a guy pretending to row their boat ?
Providence
FLO ! They tee one up to put the Friars up 1-0 ! pic.twitter.com/KTz88eDnpt — PC Men 's Hockey ( @ FriarsHockey ) November 27 , 2016
In our final example , the Friars provide us a refined graphic that , again , shows how sometimes simplicity is key . Its design is similar to transitions you often see on television , and has a futuristic vibe to it . Plus , owning the black and white motif is key in sustaining the brand .
Bonus : College Hockey Inc .
Why we love our game — because college hockey is like nothing else pic.twitter.com/ISFkz2LwUK — College Hockey Inc. ( @ collegehockey ) December 1 , 2016
College hockey is growing across the nation , with programs pushing to increase the sport 's popularity and awareness . College Hockey Inc. does a fantastic job promoting the sport and serving as a resource for fans everywhere . Their video content is exceptional ; I highly recommend watching the video linked above to better understand the passion and atmosphere that has built in college hockey . Let 's hope to see continued growth in the years to come !
Teen charged over fatal Carrum Downs mini-motorbike crash to remain on bail despite breaches
Updated
A teenager charged over the death of a Melbourne mother in a mini-motorcycle crash will remain on bail despite committing eight breaches , with a magistrate citing evidence that they are a `` changed individual '' .
Caleb Jakobsson is accused of running over Andrea Lehane outside a Carrum Downs shopping centre in September last year .
The Melbourne Magistrates Court was told the 19-year-old had breached the conditions of their bail at least eight times since being released from protective custody in prison in October .
The breaches included failing to adhere to a curfew and another incident which was suppressed by the court .
Magistrate Charlie Rozencwajg said they expected someone on bail while facing the serious charge of culpable driving causing death `` would toe the line to perfection '' .
`` It is not so with you , '' they said .
Magistrate Rozencwajg said Jakobsson had acted in a way that was disrespectful to Ms Lehane 's loved ones , but that bail was about risk .
Jakobsson breached bail because 'he 's in love '
The 19-year-old has been staying with a relative in country Victoria .
A hearing last week was told Jakobsson had broken their curfew imposed by court after falling in love with a single mother .
The relative Jakobsson is living with gave evidence after reporting them to police over eight breaches , telling the court they had been out with their girlfriend and new friends .
`` He 's in love , I know it 's not an excuse . Often I knew they were local and would n't pose a threat , '' they said .
`` I thank God I went to the police because he 's had a real change of heart . ''
The woman had to re-pledge they would immediately report any further breaches of bail .
Magistrate Rozencwajg said the family member had told the court `` since the last hearing , [ Jakobsson ] has been a changed individual '' .
They granted Jakobsson bail with more stringent conditions until their next court hearing in June .

Status updates suck . But communication within your business is critical to success . So what to do ?
What Happens Now
The most basic status update includes two sections :
What happened since the last update
What we plan to do next
This format is simple . But it misses a key element : if the audience for the update does n't know the context the information has no real meaning .
A Better Approach
Present Everything Relative to Objectives
Telling people what happened and what 's going to happen does n't hurt anyone , but it fails to answer the most important question : How well are things going ?
To answer this question your update has to provide the context around for you are trying to achieve . You have to answer a different set of questions :
How are you tracking to the objectives you 've set ?
What will you do next to achieve your objectives ?
For example , if you say last week we had 25 new customers , we do n't know if we should celebrate or worry . If you planned to have 50 , then 25 sucks . ( Note , you can also say if your objectives have changed . )
The same approach goes for what you 're planning to do . For example , you could simply say : “ Next week we will be finishing and shipping the carbadingulator feature. ” It 's exciting , but it 's not exciting if you meant to finish it two weeks ago . Instead , everyone would be better off if you said : “ Next week we plan to finish the next 2 features on our product backlog ( x and y ) , which means we 'll hit our next customer release on schedule with the features we planned. ” With that information we know that you are on track to hit a goal .
There are a lot of ways to express this , such as :
Write out goal and results .
List each goal and show it red/yellow/ green/completed .
List the goals and say how much work you have left to complete them ( classic scrum burn down chart ) .
Show numeric targets and the achievements ( e.g . sales target vs actual sales ) .
Present the update verbally in a stand up meeting .
The point is put everything in the context of the objectives you 're pursuing .
Go Visual
Whenever possible it helps to visualize information . This is especially the case for metrics . Simple bar charts can show progress . Add a line that shows the objective and you can quickly visualize results vs. target . Returning to the new customer example above , you could provide a chart that showed customer acquisition each week in bars with a line that showed your objective . Then anyone reading the update could instantly see if you were on target or if there was an issue , and any narrative you provide can help explain why things went better than planned or worse .
Be Consistent
Finally , consistency will help a lot . First , your audience needs to be taught how to read your updates . If the format and structure changes all the time , readers are forced to both try to figure out what the update is saying and then ascertain what matters .
Also , consistency on time frame makes a big difference . Randomly delivered status updates are hard to follow . You may be very close to what you are doing but other people are probably not , so they lose track of what is happening , which means they lose context to interpret your update . Pick a schedule for you audience : every day , week , month , quarter , etc . Then stick to it .
This matters a lot to board members , investors and advisors . These audiences have to sort through updates from many different companies . If your updates are consistently formatted and on a consistent schedule , they are more likely to be read and absorbed .
This Matters
It 's just not compelling if you get up in front of employees and say : “ Last week we did a bunch of stuff and this week we 're going to do a bunch more stuff. ” No one can tell they really achieved anything , and worse it 's not clear what you 're actually aiming for next .
If you tell your investors that stuff happened , they do n't know if they should be excited or not . If your mentors ca n't figure out how well the business is working , then they do n't know where to help .
As you build your business , you will surround yourself with people who like to set smart , ambitious objectives , work hard to achieve them , celebrate when they 're accomplished , and learn when they 're not . Good updates will motivate people , drive better decision making , and improve collaboration .
By Dinah PoKempner , Special to CNN
Editor 's note : Dinah PoKempner is general counsel at Human Rights Watch . The views expressed are the writer 's own .
Edward Snowden 's revelations , first published a year ago today , sparked a global firestorm of debate and outrage about U.S. surveillance practices , not to mention considerable wing-flapping on Capitol Hill over some exceedingly modest legislative reform . But there 's one subject that many surveillance reformers wo n't touch with a 10-foot pole : whistleblower protection for people working for the government in the intelligence and national security sectors .
No legislative proposal to protect a contractor like Snowden has gotten traction on the Hill so far . And intelligence and national security workers lack the enforceable rights that other federal employees have against retaliation for calling out wrongdoing .
Worse , no one in the United States has a clear legislative defense against punishment for revealing government secrets to the public – not even if those secrets concern violations of the Constitution , international law , or outright crimes . Indeed , the heavy blunderbuss of the Espionage Act , a law aimed at punishing leaks to the enemy , does n't exempt those who try to alert the public to grave misconduct .
Snowden had watched the government destroy the careers of stalwart career officials when they tried to report wrongdoing through existing channels . They had seen the relentless prosecution of Chelsea Manning , even after that WikiLeaks source pled guilty to offenses that could send them to prison for 20 years .
Snowden says they attempted many internal complaints , but knew that they would not produce change if they were kept from the public . Those who find it distasteful that Snowden 's shelter is Vladimir Putin 's Russia should surely be interested in pushing to make it possible for whistleblowers to find protection in the United States .
Instead , the Obama administration seems intent on turning the screws harder on any insider who might talk to the public without authorization . A new directive reportedly bars intelligence employees from unauthorized discussion with the media of even unclassified information so long as it is “ related ” to intelligence . In other words , you could now in theory be punished for helping a reporter to understand intelligence policies , even if they are n't secret .
Yet another policy forbids government insiders from even referring publicly to leaked documents or media reports about them – information pretty much everyone else in the world can talk about .
These policies are not only Kafkaesque , they are profoundly damaging to basic rights and democratic accountability . In a culture of over-classification and secrecy , insider leaks are vital to any type of national security reporting . When only “ authorized ” leaks are available , the media becomes an instrument of government propaganda , and democracy withers on the vine .
The repercussions of the Manning prosecution and the Snowden indictment go far beyond these individuals . Many who published or assisted these whistleblowers now live in the shadow of government retaliation , including Julian Assange , who will soon begin their third year of confinement in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London . Assange faces allegations of sexual assault in Sweden that they say they would answer , but with the open threat of a U.S. grand jury investigation , can not risk leaving the embassy for fear of extradition to the United States .
But the fear of retaliation also looms over journalists , professionals , assistants and supporters who helped connect Snowden and Manning to the public , and who variously endure searches , confiscations , detention , threat of arrest , and self-imposed exile . Indeed , the signal from government is clear : publicize wrongdoing in the use of official surveillance at the risk of your freedom .
It is time for Congress to address not just the suffering inflicted on these particular people , but the pall that whistleblower persecution casts on the media at large , and consequently on us all . Affirmative protections for the media and their sources should be put forward , in the form of both enforceable legal rights and robust defenses .
Why protect those who spill secrets ? Because the public has a right to know when officials who act in its name secretly trammel rights . Real national security in a democracy demands no less .

LYNNWOOD , Wash. ( AP ) - Two state troopers suffered minor injuries when their cars collided early Tuesday as they were rushing to help in a stolen car chase near Lynnwood , a Washington State Patrol spokesperson said .
The patrol cars collided at an intersection when one failed to make a turn and were totaled in the crash , said Trooper Mark Francis .
The two troopers were treated at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle and released . One man had a concussion and broken finger and the other had bruised legs , Francis said .
The incident began just after midnight when another trooper pulled over a car on Interstate 5 south of Everett . One passenger got out , but the driver took off after the black Dodge Avenger was identified as stolen .
It left the freeway in the Lynnwood area where the troopers collided . They were not directly involved in the chase , but were on their way to help , Francis said .
Meanwhile , the stolen car returned to Interstate 5 and got away after speeding through Seattle at up to 120 mph .
The passenger who got out of the car at the initial stop said they swallowed heroin . The Normandy Park man , 27 , was treated at a hospital and held . They could be charged in the stolen car case , Francis said .
House Republicans will launch a two-pronged attack next week against what they say is a string of decisions from President Obama to ignore the will of Congress and the letter of the law .
Republicans have cited the numerous delays and adjustments to ObamaCare and Obama 's 2011 decision to delay deportation proceedings against noncriminal illegal immigrants as prime examples of nonenforcement . In response , GOP leaders will call up two bills to fight back .
ADVERTISEMENT
One is the ENFORCE Act , H.R . 4138 , which would allow the House or Senate to authorize legal action against the administration 's willful neglect of the law . These lawsuits would first be heard by a three-judge panel , and any appeals would be directed to the Supreme Court .
The ENFORCE Act is similar to other Republican bills that have been proposed over the last few months . This latest version was introduced this week by Rep. Trey Gowdy ( R-S.C. ) , and it 's supported by House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa ( R-Calif. ) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte ( R-Va. ) .
`` We have pursued certain remedies afforded to Congress to address executive overreach , but these efforts have been thwarted , '' Gowdy said earlier this week . `` This bill is necessary ; it will give Congress the authority to defend this branch of government as the framers and our fellow citizens would expect . ''
Republicans will also bring up the Faithful Execution of the Law Act , H.R . 3973 . This bill from Rep. Ron DeSantis ( R-Fla. ) would require the government to report to Congress whenever a decision has been made not to enforce the law and explain why that decision was made .
`` President Obama has not only failed to uphold several of our nation 's laws , they have vowed to continue to do so in order to enact their unpopular agenda , '' DeSantis said in January when they offered their bill . `` The president assured the public that their administration would be the most transparent in history , and while the President has fallen woefully short on this promise , my bill will be a step in the right direction .
`` The American people deserve to know exactly which laws the Obama administration is refusing to enforce and why . ''
Black Roots , 1981
It 's no overstatement to say that Bristol Archive Records is one of the most important archives of a city 's musical culture anywhere in the world . Since 2008 , they have been working tirelessly to unearth and recognise lost or forgotten recordings from Bristol 's past . Also covering punk in its prime , it 's their reggae releases that has really caught our eye . Four Reggae Explosion compilations have been released so far , featuring Bristol 's two most famous reggae exports , Black Roots and Talisman , alongside Joshua Moses , Bunny Marrett and many others . Each compilation is a carefully constructed piece of musical history , accompanied by detailed footnotes and supported online , by a wealth of archive material . Each track , an historical record in itself , tells tales of unemployment , disillusionment , police brutality and overall , what it was like as growing up in Bristol in the 70s and 80s .
Meeting label head Mike Darby , you get some idea how BAR has come to be such an important Bristol institution . A tall , imposing figure , outspoken yet hugely passionate about the musical heritage of their hometown , they seem like just the man to lead the sizeable , often thankless task BAR has undertaken . In an illuminating interview that was used as part of my own dissertation on Bristol reggae ( which you can read on the BAR blog ) , Darby sheds light on the scene in the 70s and 80s , and opens up about the rewards and challenges of running the label . Bristol Reggae Explosion Live is out now , available on from Bristol Archive Records , with all proceeds going to St Paul 's Carnival . Also , two years after reforming , Talisman have just released their third studio album , i-Surrection , available from Sugar Shack Records .
How would you describe Bristol Archive Records ?
BAR is what is says on the tin . It 's a record label that tells a story of the history of the Bristol music scene from 1977 onwards . It tells a complete story of Bristol 's musical past through re-releasing old recordings , previously unreleased demos and compilations albums . The whole thing is very much scene based and anyone visiting it from around the world will discvoer hidden gems of Bristol music culture .
Creating historical record is a big part of that BAR mission statement and the archive on your website is like nothing else offered in Bristol . How have you gone about creating that and putting it together .
I think there 's nothing like it in the world ! The reason for that is that most musicians ca n't co-operate . When I was in a band in 1979 , there was no music scene in Bristol , no collaboration , no assistance , no music industry per sé . So there were no lawyers , accountants and managers . Everybody was very insular and trying to do their own thing . I 've been lucky enough to break down those barriers where musicians hang onto stuff in the hope it 's actually worth something . All it 's worth is a story , a piece of history , an account in time .
Talisman
Looking at Bristol reggae in the late-1970/1980s , your ska/punk band Rimshots formed in 1979 , the same year as Black Roots and Talisman . Was there any cross over between the white and black scene at the time ?
We supported Talisman twice , Black Roots twice . There was a cross-over , but there were just a lot more gigs . You could go to five gigs a night and see three bands on every bill . There were so many local supports that any band , whether they were brilliant or terrible could get a gig .
Apart from the Bamboo Club , where else did you go out ?
I wouldn't 've gone to the Bamboo Club , I was too young . That got shut down in 1977 after it burnt down just before the Pistol 's gig . I would 've gone to places like Trinity Hall , the Stone House , Green Room , Cowardines on Park Street , Tiffany 's ontop of Black Boy Hill . And then you had all the University campuses which do n't exist anymore . Brstiol University 's Union does n't do anything anymore either but you had the Anson Rooms which had big gigs but also the Epicurium bar upstairs which was every Saturday night packed with students and a live band .
You 've spoken before about Talisman as your favourite reggae band . What puts them ahead of Black Roots in your eyes ?
Black Roots are the biggest and most successful and , rightly so , are the kings . I just found Talisman slightly more commercial , not so hardcore roots , slightly more pop . They were a little bit more accessible .
Did this cause tension between the two groups , the fact that they were vying for the same space in Bristol ?
I think that 's bullshit . They were n't vying for anything in Bristol . They both played all over the UK on the university circuit and did John Peel sessions . Black Roots toured Europe with UB40 . Bristol has never been the hub of anything . Even now with Massive Attack and Portishead , Bristol is n't the centre of the universe , it never has been . It 's just got a load of cool bands .

News Release — Gov . Peter Shumlin
July 1 , 2013
BURLINGTON — On the eve of the 2013 Vermont Brewers Festival , a sold-out event that draws thousands to Burlington 's Waterfront to celebrate the state 's robust craft brew-industry , Gov . Shumlin and artisan beer advocates cheered a new law allowing craft brewers to send their beer to in- and out-of-state customers .
Get all of VTDigger 's daily news . You 'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox .
“ Vermont brewers produce the best beer in the world . We 've worked hard to make this state a great place for them to do business , and this new law is one more step in that direction , ” Gov . Shumlin said , standing in the tasting room of Switchback Brewing Company in Burlington . “ As our artisan beer industry grows , this is yet another tool for them to market their products and increase their name recognition . It 's also a good way for people to purchase Vermont 's great craft brews . ”
The Governor said Vermont 's value-added specialty beer industry has grown from a handful of early start-ups like the Vermont Pub and Brewery , to 35 today that include labels like Otter Creek , Long Trail , Magic Hat , Hill Farmstead , The Alchemist and Rock Art . Several newly proposed start-ups are in the planning or licensing stage .
According to the national Brewers Association , Vermont ranks first in the nation for most breweries and brew pubs per capita .
“ The Vermont Brewers Association got it right : Small state , big beer , ” Gov . Shumlin said . Switchback Brewery is an example of the success . Owner Bill Cherry launched the brewery 11 years ago , and the very first pint of Switchback was served at Ake 's Place in Burlington on October 22 , 2002 . Several expansions later , Switchback is now being bottled in Vermont and sold both in and out of state .
“ Vermont brewers and their exceptional beers are a reflection of Vermonters , who take pride in and support their local businesses . Vermont beers capture this spirit of individualism , and this is a big part of their success not only in Vermont , but throughout the country , ” said Cherry . “ Having a state government that is willing to improve the business climate through thoughtful legislation creates an unbeatable combination enabling brewers to succeed . ”
Proof of the strength of this industry , the Governor said , is the enormous popularity of the Vermont Brewers Festival , which sold out within days of tickets becoming available . The two-day event , which kicks off tomorrow evening , features tastings , educational programs , opportunities to meet the brewers , and other measures .

While the Brewers Festival is sold out , there are several other beer festivals held around the state throughout the year , including events at Smugglers ' Notch , Mount Snow , Killington , and Okemo . There are also community festivals like “ MontBeerlier ” that are gaining popularity .
The state and the Brewers Association have also worked to strengthen the industry . The Vermont Brewery Challenge Passport , created by the Association , provides beer lovers with a ‘ passport ' they can get stamped during visits to local breweries and brewpubs for prizes .
The state 's Tourism and Marketing Department is also partnering with Long Trail Brewery to market Vermont outside the state . The state is providing information on Vermont craft brews to bars and retail stores in New Jersey , Washington D.C. , and Philadelphia . In addition , the agency hosted a first “ Meet the Brewers ” vacation contest , with more than 6,000 people participating . And the state 's new agritourism website DigInVT.com connects visitors with 400 Vermont farm , food and brew experiences , including the Beer and Cheese Pairing Trail .
Isaac Newton held a clear glass prism to the sunbeam that penetrated the shutters of their darkened room and watched in awe as the wall of their office danced with all the colours of the rainbow .
The 28-year-old physicist at Trinity College , Cambridge , was the first to show that white light is a blend of primary colours , a discovery that explains why grass is green and the sky is blue .
Their written account of the experiment in 1671 is among the oldest in a collection of scientific milestones described in Letters to the Royal Society , which are made public today to celebrate the 350th anniversary of Britain 's academy of science . The documents are released through an online library project called Trailblazing , a name inspired by Newton 's famous nod to the work of their predecessors in a note to their rival Robert Hooke : `` If I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants . ''
The letters to the society record the march of science from the earliest blood transfusions , and attempts to capture lightning , to the confirmation of Einstein 's theory of relativity , the discovery of DNA and Stephen Hawking 's first musings on black holes . The letters reveal a history of failure eclipsed by success , and the maturation of science from a haphazard amateur pursuit to the systematised professionalism of today .
`` At that time the only scientists who were in any sense professionals were astronomers and maybe medical doctors , and of the two , the astronomers were the only ones who probably did more good than harm , '' said Professor Martin Rees , the astronomer royal and president of the society . `` If you look at these records , you ca n't help but notice the immense range of interests they had . They were motivated by curiosity . ''
There is the letter from the chemist Robert Boyle , asking the physician Richard Lower about the consequences of transfusing blood from one animal into another . Does a dog lose its quirks after transfusion and gain those of the donor ? Does blood from a big dog make a small dog grow ? Can you safely replace a frog 's blood with blood from a calf , and might that change one species into another ? The answers were no , no , no and no .
That did not stop Lower moving on to human experiments , paying an `` addle-brained '' man 20 shillings to receive blood from a lamb . There were hopes it might cure the man 's mental condition , but when Samuel Pepys , a president of the society , questioned the physician afterwards , Lower noted that their subject was still `` a little cracked in the head '' .
A letter from Benjamin Franklin from 1752 dispels the myth that lightning is a supernatural force . They recount an experiment in Philadelphia that they were lucky to survive , involving a thunderstorm and a kite armed with a long metal spike .
Franklin had a keen eye for the appliance of science . On witnessing the Montgolfier brothers ' hot air balloon flight , the polymath declared such a device might be strapped to one 's errand boy , so they could hop over hedges more swiftly as they ran from house to house . Or , Franklin mused , it could carry wine to great altitude and keep it cool .
In 1769 , the English naturalist Daines Barrington wrote to the society after a barrage of tests confirmed that Mozart was indeed a child genius . Barrington visited the eight-year-old at their parents ' home , and asked them to play scores they had never seen and to compose on the spot . `` His execution was amazing , considering their little fingers could scarcely reach a 5th on the harpsichord , '' Barrington wrote on hearing one recital .
They vouched for Mozart 's age , by confirming birth certificate detail and documenting their behaviour . `` Whilst they were playing to me , a favourite cat came in , upon which they immediately left their harpsichord , nor could we bring them back for a considerable time , '' they wrote . `` He would also sometimes run about the room with a stick between their legs by way of horse . ''
After a safe return to Britain aboard HMS Resolution , Captain James Cook wrote to the Royal Society in 1776 to disclose how they saved their crew from scurvy by filling the hold with `` sweet-wort '' , sauerkraut , lemons and vegetables . One sailor died of an unrelated disease . `` Two others were unfortunately drowned , and one killed by a fall ; so of the whole number with which I set out from England I lost only four , '' Cook wrote .
Scientific progress brought inevitable clashes with scripture . The fossilised remains of elephants , tigers , rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses in Kirkdale , Yorkshire , were not washed there by a biblical flood , but showed life on Earth had existed for millions of years , noted the Rev William Buckland in 1822 .
To mark the anniversary , the society is calling leading researchers together to thrash out the biggest issues for modern science . Feeding the world and providing clean , green energy will doubtless feature , as will more basic questions on the nature of ageing and consciousness .
`` Our world is completely transformed through the application of scientific concepts which could not even be conceived of at the time the society was founded , '' said Rees . `` New questions come into focus as old ones are answered . The important thing about science is it 's an unending quest . ''
The rise of the 'invisible college '
The Royal Society emerged from an `` invisible college '' of natural philosophers who met in London in the 1640s to discuss the ideas of Francis Bacon . It became a formal society at Gresham College in November 1660 and included prominent names of the time such as architect Christopher Wren , scientist Robert Boyle and John Wilkins , inventor of the metric system .
The society held weekly meetings where experiments were described or performed before the audience . In a royal charter of 1663 , the group was officially named as The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge .
It is the world 's oldest scientific academy in continuous existence , with more than 60 Nobel laureates among its 1,400 fellows and foreign members . Since 1967 , it has occupied a row of buildings overlooking St James 's Park in London .
Every year , the society names 44 scientists as fellows in recognition of their scientific achievements .
The accolade is the highest a scientist can have , short of a Nobel prize . Existing fellows include neuroscientist Dame Nancy Rothwell , astronomer Jocelyn Bell-Burnell and Cambridge cosmologist Stephen Hawking .
In recent years , a burgeoning soccer market emerges , serving to illustrate the voracious and growing appetite for the sport in the United States and North America .
Last year , it was Sacramento , Indianapolis and Orlando City garnering headlines . From 2011-13 , Cascadia emerged , with Seattle , Portland and Vancouver demonstrating the potential for soccer in this country . Recently , Minneapolis and San Antonio have also impressed with tremendous growth from their budding soccer audiences .
So which city will be this year 's next American soccer success story ?
For that answer , you may want to look just north of Orlando .
While the Lion 's Purple Nation continues to grow and David Beckham garners national headlines in their quest for a Miami MLS franchise , the North American Soccer League 's Jacksonville Armada have quietly laid down the foundation for what promises to be a vibrant soccer club .
With nearly 5,000 season ticket holders in tow , and nearly 10,000 tickets sold to their inaugural match against FC Edmonton , Jacksonville looks all but poised to become this year 's Cinderella soccer success story .
“ There is definitely a buzz , ” Armada President Steve Livingstone told EOS earlier this week . “ When I moved about ten years ago , youth soccer was about it . Then , it was almost like an explosion when Scotland came here and the US played their friendly here . The whole atmosphere changed . A big crowd came out , it was a festival atmosphere all weekend and that put Jacksonville on the map .
“ It 's an exciting time to be involved in Soccer in Florida , at every level , carrying on to youth soccer . Things are changing here and the game is getting more exposure . ”

With nascent Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella , the company is heading in a new , unified direction . The objective : create a cohesive Windows ecosystem across all devices . Whether you 're using Windows on a PC , a Surface tablet , an Xbox One or a Windows Phone device — Microsoft wants you to be able to access your content . It 's accomplishing this goal with the next version of its veteran operating system , Windows 10 .
And this is the simplified approach Microsoft is applying to the next step in computing as well : virtual reality .
When Facebook 's VR solution , the Oculus Rift , launches in early 2016 , your Windows 10 computer will be ready to go ( The Oculus Rift needs a PC to run ) . Simply plug in the Oculus Rift and Windows 10 will know what 's going on . That same notion applies to VR headsets from the likes of HTC/Valve and , of course , Microsoft 's own `` mixed reality '' headset , HoloLens .
No one will ever look this cool using a virtual reality headset Oculus VR
In short , Microsoft wants Windows 10 to be the destination for next-generation computing experiences . It wants to be the company that facilitates your first experiences with virtual reality , augmented reality , and `` mixed '' reality ( a blend of actual reality and computer-assisted reality , like Google Glass ) - what many see as the next step in how humans interact with computers .
Microsoft 's head of Xbox , Phil Spencer , told Business Insider a few basic ways the company is unifying disparate headsets under the banner of Windows 10 :
Headsets will be supported `` natively , '' meaning that they 're recognized and accounted for by Windows 10 . Currently , these headsets show up as monitors and must be calibrated to work with your computer . It 's a big hassle ! Thankfully , this should help circumvent the hassle .
Since all these headsets require some form of body/head tracking , and they all solve that issue in different ways , Windows 10 will unify tracking . It 's not clear exactly how this will work , but it does n't sound like Oculus VR 's tracking solution ( cameras ) will stand in for HTC/Valve 's ( lasers ) . Instead , it seems to be a solution for developers - one pipeline of tracking information across various headsets .
Are Governor Inslee and WSDOT Secretary Lynn Peterson considering canceling the deep-bore tunnel project ? It appears that they are leaving the door open for that possibility . On Tuesday , reporter Essex Porter of KIRO 7 asked Governor Inslee , “ At what point should we abandon this project ? ”
“ Well , I do n't think we 're at that point , now , ” Governor Inslee responded .
You can view the exchange on the TVW website , starting the video at the 25:20 mark .
Also on Tuesday , WSDOT Secretary Lynn Peterson spoke with KIRO radio 's Dori Monson . Dori Monson asked the WSDOT Secretary , “ So that 's something that 's on the table ? Pulling the plug on this ? ”
“ I would say that 's the worst case scenario , ” WSDOT Secretary Lynn Peterson responded .
You can hear the exchange on the KIRO Radio website , starting at the 5:47 mark .
The top government decision-makers in Washington State , when given opportunities on Tuesday to firmly end speculation that the tunnel project will be canceled due to escalating delays and cost overruns , decided to instead leave that option on the table .
Linda Watson , who has served as the president and CEO of Capital Metro for the past seven years , announced Monday they are retiring at the end of 2017 .
Watson 's retirement as chief of the city of Austin 's transit agency will be effective Dec. 31 . The board of directors intends to conduct a national search to replace Watson and will appoint an interim CEO if one is not found before they depart .
“ It has been my honor and privilege to serve this community and Capital Metro as the president and CEO , ” they said in a statement . “ I 'm incredibly proud of our team and what we have accomplished together and am confident that this organization and its employees are well-positioned to tackle the challenging transportation issues facing Central Texas . ”
Watson began their tenure at Capital Metro with a 73-page audit from the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission tasked with reviewing state agencies for better functionality and efficiencies . Under that audit , Watson assisted the agency in better managing its finances , bringing increased transparency and communication , and overhauling its labor structure by outsourcing bus operators and maintenance staff to a third-party contractor .
Watson has almost 35 years of experience working in the transit industry and previously served as CEO of LYNX , the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority , and as deputy CEO at the Fort Worth Transportation Authority .
Capital Metro board chair Wade Cooper said Watson has the ability to provide strong leadership both internally and externally .
“ Under Ms. Watson 's leadership , every aspect of Capital Metro has dramatically improved , ” they said in a statement . “ She has been very successful in putting together a great team dedicated to quality service , and they have been a good flight attendant of public resources . She 's also effectively positioned the agency through solid partnerships to help resolve the increasing complex mobility issues affecting the region . ”
Other highlights of Watson 's career at Capital Metro include implementing the two MetroRapid bus routes , breaking ground on the 10-acre Plaza Saltillo mixed-use development off the MetroRail line and implementing improvements to the MetroRail commuter line .

It was clear to some who spent time around Missouri gubernatorial candidate Tom Schweich that the pressures of an increasingly nasty campaign had gotten to them in the days leading up to their suicide .
Missouri state Rep. Kevin Engler and their wife saw Schweich at a Republican rally in Kansas City , Missouri , five days before their death.While most politicians there were shaking hands and meeting the crowd , Schweich could do little more than worry , their colleague observed .
“ Tom just looked stressed , ” Engler told NBC News . “ My wife commented that they look like he 's under a lot of stress and obviously they are . ”
As an early frontrunner in the race for the Republican party 's nomination for governor , Schweich , the Missouri state auditor , had already found themselves immersed in a nasty campaign more than a year and a half before Election Day . That all came to an end two weeks ago , when authorities found the 54-year-old dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound .
Their death brought into focus the negative nature of politics when former Sen. Jack Danforth delivered a blistering eulogy decrying the current climate of campaigning and called on both candidates and voters “ to turn politics into something much better . ”
“ The message for the rest of us reflects my own emotion after learning of Tom 's death , which has been overwhelming anger . Politics has gone so hideously wrong , and that the death of Tom Schweich is the natural consequence of what politics has become , ” Danforth , a mentor to Schweich , said at the funeral . “ I believe deep in my heart that it 's now our duty , yours and mine , to turn politics into something much better than It 's now so miserable state . ”
So far Danforth 's words seem to have done little more than entrench previous divisions within Missouri 's Republican party . Some of Schweich 's friends and allies have called for accountability for state GOP chair John Hancock , who is accused of being behind the tactics that may have pushed Schweich over the edge . Hancock announced Thursday they have no plans to resign at the same a group of GOP state legislators said they need to be replaced for failing to institute any reforms since Schweich 's death .
“ I think the only way this gets turned around is if voters begin to punish candidates whose operatives or whose campaigns engage in this , ” Sen. Claire Mccaskill , D-Mo. , said on “ Meet The Press ” Sunday .
Engler said Danforth 's eulogy has started a debate amongst state legislators over whether they crossed the line by directly linking nasty politics to Schweich 's decision to take their own life . It so far appears the father of two left no note .
`` We 've had partisan chapters before in our history but nothing compares to the situation today . Not even close . ''
“ I 've had plenty of negative ads run against me , but I 've never thought of killing myself , ” Engler said .
And even Danforth mentioned at the funeral that they advised Schweich not to run for office six years ago , saying their friend was “ easily hurt and quickly offended. ” ( Danforth 's office said the former senator would like their eulogy to speak for itself and declined to comment for this article . )
But no matter what the reasons were behind Schweich 's decision to take their own life , political watchers say there are plenty of signs thatelections have become increasingly hostile in recent years .
The 2012 presidential race set records for both the volume of advertising and the overall negativity that hit airwaves , according to a study by the Wesleyan Media Project . Almost 65 percent of ads in the 2012 presidential race were purely negative . That is a steady increase from 2008 , when 51 percent of ads were negative . In 2004 , 44 percent were negative .
Outside groups were part of the reason for that increase . In 2012 , 85 percent of the ads those groups produced were negative .
The Supreme Court 's 2010 Citizens United decision has resulted in a sharp increase in political advertising paid for by third-party groups that are not required to disclose their donors , such as super PACs . Such groups have the ability to attack opponents without attaching a candidate or party 's name to ads , critics say .
A few decades ago , Russia 's Aeroflot was notoriously considered to be among the world 's worst airlines . Now it ranks among the world 's best . The Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten took a closer glance at the miraculous transformation .
Today , Aeroflot 's fleet consists mainly of new and modern Boeing and Airbus aircraft , the average age being just 4.5 years . It may come as a surprise for many , but the Russian state company is now rated as the second highest four-star airline by Skytrax along with renowned competitors such as Emirates , Qantas and Lufthansa . Remarkably , neither SAS nor Norwegian achieved more than 3 stars in this competition .
Myths of the Soviet era linger on

The company 's development has been closely followed by aviation enthusiast Per Julius Helweg , currently employed at Avinor . The extreme transformation of Aeroflot has not passed them by :
`` My opinion is that it is thanks to the glasnost policy [ a 1980s Soviet slogan for increased transparency in the public sector ] that the Russians today can offer such a safe and high-quality product . But the myth about grumpy staff in dangerous flights from the Soviet times still lingers on , '' Helweg told Aftenposten .
According to Helweg , the company has tightened its safety policy through close contact with Western partners , having replaced its outdated Soviet-made Tupolev and Ilyushin jets with new aircraft from Airbus and Boeing .
Young , vibrant and modern

Skytrax assures that the upgrade of Aeroflot 's status is well justified .
`` Customer experience with Aeroflot has been remarkably improved over the past few years , and we at Skytrax have been monitored this process closely over time . In addition , Aeroflot possesses one of the youngest fleets among airlines on their size . Having improved the service , Aeroflot stands today as young , vibrant and modern '' , said Skytrax 's CEO Edward Plaisted .
A personal experience

There are hardly any Norwegians who have traveled with Aeroflot more than Hans-Wilhelm Steinfeld , broadcaster and NRK 's former Moscow correspondent .
`` This is rewarding , and very well-deserved . Both the level of service and the flying experience with Aeroflot have considerably improved over the years . In the past , the flights could have been rather mediocre . We called Aeroflot ‘ chicken airlines ' as they always served cold chicken legs . Today I would rate the company as ‘ five , ' '' Steinfeld said .
Not a single accident in 20 years
Aeroflot 's new sales manager in Norway , Gonzalo Peluffo , is proud of the accomplishment .
`` This is very nice for Aeroflot , and our new ‘ stardom ' will hopefully make it easier for us to sell more tickets in the Norwegian market . In particular we would like to attract more business travelers . I know many are still flinching when travel agencies propose flights with Aeroflot . This probably reflects the fact that the company is still struggling with a bad reputation of old . Now we hope things will take a turn for the better , '' Peluffo told Aftenposten .
Earlier they abandoned their job on Air France-KLM to join the Russian company on the upswing and has no regrets .
`` Aeroflot has undergone major changes , gradually over many years . We have considerably upgraded the service on board and have a growing global route network . Besides , Aeroflot always serves food , and baggage and seat reservation also included in the ticket fare , '' said Peluffo , stating that Aeroflot has not had a single accident in over 20 years .
If you want to be a popular quarterback with New York Jets fans , your best best is to slide as far down the depth chart as possible . We know the backup quarterback is always the most popular guy in town but here with the Jets , the third and fourth stringers have truly become the belles of the ball .
After playing a respectable fourth quarter and overtime in last week 's pre-season game , Matt Simms is now the “ hot ” name . There are an alarmingly high number of Jets fans , “ journalists ” ( or whatever we call Mike Lupica these days ) and other assorted voices calling for Simms to “ just get a chance. ” No , really . There is a large section of people following this team who really think Matt Simms could be a viable starter for week one and there is another large section who thinks Greg McElroy should be the guy .
If Simms goes out and plays well tonight , I ca n't even imagine the commotion . Nevermind that they will be playing against the 2nd and 3rd stringers of the one of the league 's projected worst defenses who will be running nothing but vanilla , high-school level schemes , if Simms throws a few TDs…he 's shown enough !
We 've seen this movie before . This is fan-base who has aggressively called for Brooks Bollinger , Brett Ratliff and Erik Ainge in the past .
There is a reason Matt Simms was n't drafted . There is a reason they were the Jets fourth quarterback last summer before being cut . There is a reason nobody signed them until the Jets decided to bring them back as their 4th quarterback this summer . The Jets do n't know something the rest of the league does n't . Simms has been their fourth quarterback the majority of summer , literally receiving zero work with the starting line-up and likely minimal work with even the second string . Sure , they have a nice arm and maybe they can develop into a backup down road but how about they get a season under their belt as a third quarterback first ? Somehow I 'm doubtful he 's ready to make the leap from 4th string to 1st string because they completed 11 passes against the Giants third string secondary .
As for the McElroy fanatics . There is something they always conveniently forget to mention : They got a start last year , against a poor defense and was completely overmatched . They got their chance , played badly and was injured . They are injured again now and they were injured in their rookie year . They are n't durable and does n't have NFL pocket presence or arm strength . Stop trumping up their performance against Arizona last year . They completed 5 passes for 29 yards and had an interception incorrectly overruled because of a bad call by the referee .
It is amazing how quickly some Jets fans have washed their hands of Geno Smith . There is no question they were bad last week but that 's it ? Time to throw in the towel on this year 's 2nd round pick and hand the reigns to Simms ? Certain Jets fans talk about a desire to win right now but ignore that Mark Sanchez has been the only Jets quarterback to move the ball consistently against a starting defense in the pre-season . I do n't care how many times you watch the Butt-Fumble GIF , the Jets would be better off starting Sanchez week one than Simms or McElroy…by a wide margin .
What happens if Graham Harrell plays well in the second half tonight , should they start week one ?
Do n't be so quarterback starved that you do n't think rationally . Do n't Tweet # FreeGeno an hour before the Jets/Giants game and then 4 hours later be demanding a fourth stringer you never heard until that night start week one . There are two players , barring injury , who will start this season for the Jets at quarterback – Mark Sanchez and Geno Smith . Do n't waste your breath calling for McElroy or Simms because one wo n't be on the roster in 4 days and one will be inactive every Sunday .

Brian Eno Releases Experimental , Extremely Targeted Album “ Music for Waiting at the DMV on Your Birthday , Kevin ”
LOS ANGELES — Brian Eno released their latest album earlier this week , which Eno believes is the perfect soundscape for any man named Kevin waiting at the DMV on their birthday , according to the press release .
“ I was at the DMV a few months ago , and a man in front of me grew incredibly irate , ” recounted Eno . “ The clerk informed them that they were in the wrong line for their particular bit of business and directed them to another . The man threw their arms in the air and shouted , ‘ Well , happy birthday to me , right ? ! ' before shuffling off . I was overwhelmed by the notion that this occurrence should have a lush , ambient soundtrack . ”
When asked how they knew the man 's name was Kevin , Eno replied , “ Well , they looked like a Kevin . ”
Much like their 1978 effort Ambient 1 : Music For Airports , Music for Waiting at the DMV on Your Birthday , Kevin strives to relieve the tension and anxieties of real-life situations . However , some critics worry Eno is appealing to a demographic so small , it may be a misstep .
Related :
“ Commercially , this work has no hope for success , ” said Pitchfork writer Stephanie Chainch . “ There are approximately 196,000 people named Kevin in the U.S. Eno has created an album relevant only to them , only once a year , provided they are unlucky enough to have to go to the DMV that day — bringing the potential audience to about 24 people . Not to mention , after listening to the album , I expect many of these Kevins will find it meandering and inaccessible . ”
Even Kevins familiar with Eno 's extensive work are jeering their latest offering .
“ Here Come the Warm Jets is one of my favorite albums , and the six-second Windows 95 startup song blew me away , but this… this is just a mess , ” said longtime fan Kevin Stetfield . “ It fails to live up to the high standard of ambient work he 's done before . If anything , it was more of a distraction . ”
Stetfield later admitted they first listened to the new album yesterday , three months before their birthday , while in a dentist 's waiting room before having their wisdom teeth removed .

Animation 1 – Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly Maps from the CMC Environment Canada ( September 17 , 2016 and October 27 , 2016 )
The Blob was the name given to the area of elevated sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern extratropical North Pacific . It formed in 2013 , coupling with a ridge of high pressure that impacted weather patterns across North America into 2015 . The Blob was the primary contributor to the reported record high global sea surface temperature anomalies in 2014 , and contributed to the record highs in 2015 along with the 2015 portion of the 2014/15/16 El Niño . ( See General Discussions 2 and 3 of my free ebook On Global Warming and the Illusion of Control – Part 1 . Also see the series of posts about The Blob for additional general information . )
After a noticeable drop in the sea surface temperature anomalies for that region of the eastern extratropical North Pacific that lasted from late-2015 through mid-2016 , the Blob reemerged in August , with the sea surface temperature anomalies peaking in September for 2016 . See Animation 2 , which includes daily sea surface temperature anomaly maps running from June 1 , 2016 through today . ( Depending on your browser , you may need to click on the animation . )
Animation 2 – Daily Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly Maps from the CMC Environment Canada ( June 1 , 2016 through October 27 , 2016 )
As shown , The Blob began to decay noticeably in early-to-mid October and has , now , basically disappeared from its normal location , though there are still elevated sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern and central extratropical North Pacific .
We should expect a noticeable decline in the sea surface temperature anomalies this month in The Blob region , and in the North Pacific as a whole , when the monthly sea surface temperature data for October are published early next month .
Will The Blob disappear for good in the future or will it reappear annually during the boreal summer months as part of a new seasonal cycle ? Only time will tell .
So last week I was all about sound . That was until I went to add in some sounds for the UI , like zooming in . At that point , I realized I did n't really have a ‘ zoom in ' , I was just switching cameras . And that is how the rabbit hole began .
In this test video I had completely rewritten the camera system , moving away from cameras tied to the individual MAV and weapons , and instead , using a global camera manager . This solves quite a few issues :
Unity frame lag is gone .
Turning a camera on in Unity is an incredibly expensive operation and the old system relied on turning cameras on and off to switch weapons .
Transitions are possible .
Because each camera is always around , I can actually control where it is and what it is doing . This means fun things like camera transitions and effects .
Spectator mode can be MUCH better .
This whole system is built around a floating camera , which is exactly what spectator mode is . This system allows the camera to be attached to any control system , making it even possible to ‘ leave your MAV ' if that is something that fits the game .
But , if you watch that video close enough , you can tell it 's not perfect yet . I have been hammering down on all the little bugs and trying to perfect the system . I have already smashed out quite a few of these bugs , but there are still some issues with when you first spawn in . I might defer these to when I redo the gameflow , as it really is a part of that system and this task has already rabbit holed for a whole week . Plus , I am super excited to be moving on to destruction and sound . I want to spend a week working on the destruction and particle fx in the game , then move on to finalizing some of the audio the week of Thanksgiving . Does this sound exciting to you ? Then join me on Twitch tonight and help me create some more explosions !
I have also made the choice to extend my streaming schedule to have another dev session on the weekends .

An international observer mission has arrived to watch over next week 's federal vote and report on how controversial changes to Canada 's election laws affect the democratic process .
Hannah Roberts , who is leading the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe mission , told CTV 's Power Play that the group decided to send a team to Canada for the Oct. 19 election after assessing the need for a mission in May .
“ People thought it would be useful to have independent assessment of the elections , particularly in view of the fact that there 's this new legislative framework , and in order to see how that is , and also how it works in practice , ” said Roberts .
“ Some of the other issues that came up are around campaign finance , the participation of national minorities and aboriginal peoples . ”
That new legislation is the Fair Elections Act . The bill became law last year and , among other measures , includes stricter identification requirements for voters -- a change critics say makes voting more difficult for some Canadians . According to Roberts , the OSCE team is in Canada to monitor the effects of those changes .
“ We 're a six-person team and we 're here for a few weeks so we 're not here to quantify the election or investigate every detail of it . We 're here to look at the system and see where the system 's working well … and also where there can be improvements . ”
Roberts said their team will go to polling stations to see how things are working and talk to people to get to the bottom of any problems , so they can determine how to best prevent those issues from arising again . The group will then release a public report on its findings and corresponding recommendations a couple of months after the election .
While the OSCE has monitored more controversial elections in countries such as Ukraine , Roberts said it is not unusual for member states to invite observers to their own country as well . There are 57 member states in the OSCE , including Canada .
Hello . I 'm the FPL Helper and I 'm here to help you with FPL .
WHAT IS FPL ?
FPL is the Fantasy Premier League . It 's like the Premier League only it 's not real . It 's a game you play on the internet . You can enter and set up a team for free on this site : fantasy.premierleague.com . Then you can join leagues with your mates and have some fun .
My first tip : playing for money always makes things more interesting .
I 'll be joining in with my mates as usual in the “ Clonakilty Langers ” league . We all put in a tenner each at the start of the season and the winner at the end takes it all . I won it last year and used the 30 quid to buy some Hi-Tec football boots at the local market .
This year I think I will also join the Let 's Bet league and teach those guys a thing or two about FPL .
WHAT MAKES ME AN FPL EXPERT ?
Last year in the FPL I finished very high up in the worldwide leaderboard . I do n't want to blow my own trombone but let 's just say that 150,000 is a nice number . Also , apart from winning the Clonakilty Langers league twice in the last seven years , I watch lots of football and I even record Match Of The Day every Saturday so that I can rewatch it the next Friday to prepare for the weekend ahead . That 's the dedication required to excel at FPL .
MY TACTICS
You have to make a strong start . If you make a slow start , you 'll get left in the blocks . Nobody wants to be left on the ropes and have to play catch-up from behind .
Do n't take too many chances with your initial squad of 15 . Go for the proven players who produce the goods day in , day out , week in , week out , month in , month out , year in , year out . Sure , there 's always one foreign player who comes in that nobody has heard of who literally explodes all over the pitch . It 's ok to take one or two chances with your squad at finding that exploding player but do n't fall overboard .
MY FINAL SQUAD OF 15
After three months of solid research and hard work , I have come up with the following team :
GOALKEEPERS
Pepe Raina of Liverpool is my pick for first choice goalkeeper . You do n't need to look at the stats to know that he 's top quality . In fact , I never look at any stats anyway . I use my gut . You can use stats to prove anything but your gut will always be truthful to you . That 's just basic science . Raina always makes lots of saves and keeps plenty of clean sheets throughout the season . At a cost of 5.5m , they are great value .
The best advice I ever received when I was an FPL-newbie many years ago was to always have keepers who rotate well . That means you must have a keeper who can do a complete 360-degree spin and still maintain their balance . If you have a keeper who gets dizzy and falls down in the box , well , he 's just going to concede lots of goals .
Anders Lindguards is one keeper who I 've seen rotate very well in the past . One time they did a full 720 ! He 'll make a handy backup in case Raina gets injured or suspended .
DEFENDERS
Rafael Silva ( the handsome one of the brothers ) has cemented their place as the Manchester Utd right back . They only played 16 minutes of the Community Shield last Sunday to keep them fresh for the season ahead . They can score big points both defensively and offensively and they go straight into my back line for Gameweek 1 at a cost of 6.0m .
I have a mate who is a real expert in international football and they tell me that the big up and coming team to take over the mantlepiece from Spain is going to be Belgium . They say that even their defenders are classy footballers and they love scoring goals . When they said that , it literally hit me in the face like a wet kipper – defenders who score goals are like prime rib estate in this game ! So my next free tip to you is : get Belgian defenders . I 'm doubling up with both Vermaelen and Vertonghen and I recommend that you do too .
My next defender pick is probably the bargain of the year . Marc Muniesa is available for only 5.0m . They play for Barcelona , even though he 's listed in the game as playing for Stoke . That 's obviously a mistake on the website as no player would ever move from Barcelona to Stoke . Barcelona ( or “ Barça ” as they 're known in Italy ) play possession football which means the other team ca n't score if they do n't have the ball . This will result in lots of clean sheets for Muniesa .
Paul McShane of Hull is my last selection at the back . When I watch Ireland matches on the television , I hear the crowd singing lots of songs about him , sometimes even when he 's not on the pitch ! I suppose they must be really good and at a price of only 4.0m it 's worth a risk to find out . I 'm declaring them my “ maverick choice of the week ” .
MIDFIELDERS
Gareth Bale was the top scoring midfielder in the game last year . If you do n't have them in your team this season then you might as well not even play . He 's a must-have . Their left foot is so magical I read that there might be a film made about it starring Daniel Day Lewis .
James Milner is my favourite player ever and they go straight into my team . I 'm not sure why it is exactly that I love them so much – maybe the silky skills , the work ethic , the crazy goal celebrations or maybe that they look a bit like my ex-girlfriend , Lucy . ( I miss you , Lucy ! )
Jonobi Mikel is only 4.5m ! I ca n't believe he 's so cheap . Every good team needs a quality defensive midfielder , someone who can make tackles and interceptions and protect the defence . Mikel is an easy pick at that price , allowing you to save money to invest in strikers .
Craig Gardner of Sunderland is listed as a midfielder in the FPL game but they actually play as a right back . This is known as an “ out of position ” player and it 's important to take advantage of things like that . Welcome to my team , Craig .
Now we need a cheap 5th midfielder . My favoured formation is 1-3-4-3 which means we will never need a 5th midfielder , so we might as well buy a cheapie to sit on the bench and save our budget for elsewhere . That 's called smart thinking . At just 4.5m , I think Ruel Fox from Norwich is a good choice .
FORWARDS
Luis Suarez is a marmite type of player – you either take a bite out of them or they take a bite out of you . Haha , sorry , that 's just a little joke . Sometimes I like to break up the seriousness of FPL with a touch of humour . I hope that 's ok . But seriously , Suarez is amazing at goals and assists . Sometimes they make a great assist and then gets on the end of it themselves to score the goal . That 's how good they are . This selection is a no-brainer .
Wayne Rooney or Robin Persie ? That 's the big question everyone has been asking all summer . The important thing to know is that Persie will cost you 14.0m . That 's almost 15 million gone out of your budget on one player ! Madness ! This is a case where you just have to use common sense and take Rooney at 10.5m . Common sense is very important in this game . And I 'm sorry but you either have it or you do n't . You ca n't learn common sense in school . That 's why I never really bothered with school .
I have 8.0m left to spend on my last forward . That gives me two options . Emanwell Adebayor or Roman Lukaku . Both are good players who can score goals . My motto is that if in doubt , go for experience . Wikipedia tells me that Adebayor is older so he 's my final pick .
Total team value : 100.0m
CAPTAIN
Some people take crazy risks with their captaincy but with double points at stake I think you should always play safe . And if you look up the word “ safe ” in a dictionary , you 'll see a picture of none other than James Milner himself .
OTHER TIPS
Remember that nobody is perfect and my team might not score the highest in the world in Gameweek 1 but I am definitely expecting over 100 points . Here 's some other advice that will stand you well :
— A few of the Wigan players looked really good in the Community Shield against Man Utd and there might be some budget options in that team to take advantage of . Look out for Yordi Gomes and John McClane in particular .
— Gameweek 1 is a double gameweek for Chelsea and Aston Villa because they play twice in the week . Some people might advise you to put in extra players from those two teams but that 's a big mistake . Firstly , you 're not allowed to have extra players in your team . 15 is the max . Secondly , the Chelsea and Aston Villa players will be very tired in the second game and wo n't do well at all . I once tried to play two games of Fifa 14 in a row but I could n't manage it . My hand was killing me !
— In fact , be careful with picking any Chelsea players . They have a new manager this season . He 's from a place called Portugal in South America , so it 's going to take them some time to learn English and to get used to the English game .

Maurice H. Decker , who served as Camping Editor for Outdoor Life , writes this amazing guide on how to make your own leather moccasins in a 1937 issue of Popular Science . They write : “ This Objibwa type , two-piece moccasin fits like a shoe and is splendid for still hunting and hiking , for camp use , for canoeing and yachting , and to wear as a house slipper. ” To make these , you 'll need one piece of heavy oil-tan leather ( 12″ x 22″ ) , three yards of 1/8″ lacing , and a pair of 3/16″ thongs for ties . Decker estimates the cost to be between $ 1.25 and $ 1.50 , which would be roughly $ 20 to $ 25 in today 's dollars . Seems about right when you check out the options for moccasin kits . *
Of course , if you 're lazy ( like me ) , you can just buy ready-made moccasins from any number of well-respected labels . Try Oak Street Bootmakers , New England Outerwear , Rancourt , and Quoddy on the high-end of the price scale , or Arrow Moccasins , Wassookeag , and Town View Leather for something more affordable . I use a pair of Town Views for house slippers and absolutely love them ( just wait till the footbed forms ) .
* Update : One of our readers , Jack , recommends The Art of Hand Sewing Leather and Native American Moccasins if you 're interested in taking up these projects . They tell us the first is really a leatherwork 101 bibles , while the second is specific to various types of Native American moccasin designs . Thanks for the tip , Jack !
In law , frivolous litigation is the practice of starting or carrying on lawsuits that , due to their lack of legal merit , have little to no chance of being won . The term does not include cases that may be lost due to other matters not related to legal merit . While colloquially , a person may term a lawsuit to be frivolous if they or they personally find a claim to be absurd , in legal usage `` frivolous litigation '' consists of a claim or defense that is presented where the party ( or the party 's legal counsel ) had reason to know that the claim or defense was manifestly insufficient or futile . [ citation needed ] The fact that a claim is lost does not imply that it was frivolous .
Frivolous litigation may be based on absurd legal theories , may involve a superabundance or repetition of motions or additional suits , may be uncivil or harassing to the court , or may claim extreme remedies . A claim or defense may be frivolous because it had no underlying justification in fact , or because it was not presented with an argument for a reasonable extension or reinterpretation of the law . A claim may be deemed frivolous because existing laws unequivocally prohibit such a claim , such as a so-called Good Samaritan law .
In the United States , Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and similar state rules require that an attorney perform a due diligence investigation concerning the factual basis for any claim or defense . Jurisdictions differ on whether a claim or defense can be frivolous if the attorney acted in good faith . Because such a defense or claim wastes the court 's and the other parties ' time , resources and legal fees , sanctions may be imposed by a court upon the party or the lawyer who presents the frivolous defense or claim . The law firm may also be sanctioned , or even held in contempt .
Federal statutes and rules of court penalizing frivolous litigation [ edit ]
In the United States Tax Court , frivolous arguments may result in a penalty of up to $ 25,000 under . Similarly , section 7482 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Courts of Appeals may impose penalties in which the taxpayer 's appeal of a U.S. Tax Court decision was `` maintained primarily for delay '' or where `` the taxpayer 's position in the appeal is frivolous or groundless . `` [ 1 ] A common example , as shown below , is an argument based on tax protestor claims .
In a noncriminal case in a U.S. District Court , a litigant ( or a litigant 's attorney ) who presents any pleading , written motion or other paper to the court is required , under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , to certify that , to the best of the presenter 's knowledge and belief , the legal contentions `` are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension , modification , or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law '' . [ 2 ] Monetary civil penalties for violation of this rule may in some cases be imposed on the litigant or the attorney under Rule 11 . [ 3 ]
In one case , the Seventh Circuit Court issued an order giving such an attorney `` 14 days to show cause why they should not be fined $ 10,000 for their frivolous arguments '' . [ 4 ] A similar rule penalizing frivolous litigation applies in U.S. Bankruptcy Court under Rule 9011 . [ 5 ]
The U.S. Congress has enacted section 1912 of Title 28 of the U.S.C . providing that in the U.S. Supreme Court and in the U.S. Courts of Appeals where litigation by the losing party has caused damage to the prevailing party , the court may impose a requirement that the losing party pay the prevailing party for those damages . [ 6 ]
Litigants who represent themselves ( in forma pauperis and pro se ) sometimes make frivolous arguments due to their limited knowledge of the law and procedure . The particular tendency of prisoners to bring baseless lawsuits led to passage of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 , which limits the ability of prisoners to bring actions without payment . [ 7 ]
Court treatment of frivolous arguments [ edit ]
An example of a Court 's treatment of frivolous arguments is found in the case of Crain v. Commissioner , 737 F.2d 1417 ( 1984 ) , from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit :
Glenn Crain appeals from the dismissal of their Tax Court petition challenging the constitutional authority of that body and defying the jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service to levy taxes on their income . Crain asserts that they `` is not subject to the jurisdiction , taxation , nor regulation of the state , '' that the `` Internal Revenue Service , Incorporated '' lacks authority to exercise the judicial power of the United States , that the Tax Court is unconstitutionally attempting to exercise Article III powers , and that jurisdiction over their person has never been affirmatively proven . We perceive no need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning and copious citation of precedent ; to do so might suggest that these arguments have some colorable merit . The constitutionality of our income tax system—including the role played within that system by the Internal Revenue Service and the Tax Court—has long been established . We affirm the dismissal of Crain 's spurious `` petition '' and the assessment of a penalty imposed by the Tax Court for instituting a frivolous proceeding . 26 U.S.C . § 6673 . The government asks us to assess penalties against Crain for bringing this frivolous appeal , as is authorized by Fed . R. App . P. 38 . In Parker v. C. I. R. , 724 F. 2d 469 , 472 ( 5th Cir . 1984 ) , we sounded `` a cautionary note to those who would persistently raise arguments against the income tax which have been put to rest for years . The full range of sanctions in Rule 38 hereafter shall be summoned in response to a totally frivolous appeal . '' We are sensitive to the need for the courts to remain open to all who seek in good faith to invoke the protection of law . An appeal that lacks merit is not always—or often—frivolous . However , we are not obliged to suffer in silence the filing of baseless , insupportable appeals presenting no colorable claims of error and designed only to delay , obstruct , or incapacitate the operations of the courts or any other governmental authority . Crain 's present appeal is of this sort . It is a hodgepodge of unsupported assertions , irrelevant platitudes , and legalistic gibberish . The government should not have been put to the trouble of responding to such spurious arguments , nor this court to the trouble of `` adjudicating '' this meritless appeal . Accordingly , we grant the government 's request . The United States shall recover from appellant Crain twice its cost of this appeal . Additionally , we assess against Crain a damage award of $ 2000 in favor of the appellee United States . [ 8 ]
Impact upon filing attorney [ edit ]
Filing a claim that is ultimately deemed frivolous can be highly damaging to the attorney so filing . Attorney Daniel Evans writes :
[ W ] hen a judge calls an argument `` ridiculous '' or `` frivolous , '' it is absolutely the worst thing the judge could say . It means that the person arguing the position has absolutely no idea of what they are doing , and has completely wasted everyone 's time . It does n't mean that the case was n't well argued , or that judge simply decided for the other side , it means that there was no other side . The argument was absolutely , positively , incompetent . The judge is not telling you that you were `` wrong . '' The judge is telling you that you are out of your mind . [ 9 ]
Examples [ edit ]
Washington v. Alaimo [ edit ]
In Washington v. Alaimo [ 10 ] the court listed more than seventy-five frivolous `` motions '' ( a request for a court to issue an order ) , all of which required the attention of the Court , including the following :
Washington , an inmate from Georgia , was eventually prohibited from filing any future lawsuits or motions in any district court unless they first posted a contempt bond of $ 1,500 . To be deemed frivolous , a litigant 's arguments must strike beyond the pale . [ 12 ]
Pearson v. Chung [ edit ]
In 2005 , in Pearson v. Chung , Roy Pearson , a Washington , D.C. judge , sued a dry cleaning business for $ 67 million for allegedly losing a pair of their pants . This case has been cited as an example of frivolous litigation . [ 13 ] According to Pearson , the dry cleaners lost their pants ( which they brought in for a $ 10.50 alteration ) and refused their demands for a large refund . Pearson believed that a sign saying `` Satisfaction Guaranteed '' in the window of the shop legally entitled them to a refund for the cost of the pants , estimated at $ 1,000 . The $ 54 million total also included $ 2.0 million in `` mental distress '' and $ 15,000 which they estimated to be the cost of renting a car every weekend to go to another dry cleaners . [ 14 ] The court ultimately ruled against Pearson , whose judgeship was subsequently not renewed due to this case and several other actions they filed during their divorce , which were found to demonstrate a lack of `` judicial temperament . `` [ 15 ]
Jonathan Lee Riches [ edit ]
In 2010 , federal prosecutors asked a judge to help them stop Jonathan Lee Riches from filing any more lawsuits , arguing that their frequent filings were frivolous . [ 16 ]
Gloria Dawn Ironbox [ edit ]
In July 2013 , the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario dismissed a complaint laid by a man posing as Gloria Dawn Ironbox , a fictional feminist attorney on television series Family Guy . The claimant alleged that a marketing scheme by A & W Restaurants was `` heteronormative '' , `` phallocentric '' and promoted `` cross-sectional hegemony . '' Citing feelings of distress and alienation over the lack of `` LGBT '' representation in A & W naming conventions , they demanded $ 50,000 in damages for injury to dignity and self-respect as well as an order requiring A & W to adopt naming conventions which include non-traditional families . One such product the claimant demanded was the `` Pillow Biter '' , described by the claimant as `` a large , dark slab of meat stuffed firmly between two , white , clenched buns . `` [ 17 ]
Sirgiorgio Sanford Clardy [ edit ]
In January 2014 , Sirgiorgio Sanford Clardy , who is serving a 100-year prison sentence for a beating of a prostitute and their customer , [ 18 ] filed `` a $ 100 million lawsuit against Nike '' , for which Clardy claimed the shoe manufacturer is partially responsible . Clardy said that Nike should have placed a label in their Jordan shoes warning consumers that they could be used as a dangerous weapon . They were wearing a pair when they repeatedly stomped the face of a john who was trying to leave a Portland hotel without paying Clardy 's prostitute in June 2012 . [ 19 ] According to The Oregonian , this lawsuit gained `` considerable attention across the nation and the world . ''
Romine v. Stanton [ edit ]
In March 2016 , James Romine , an independent video game developer who founded Digital Homicide Studios sued video game critic Jim Sterling ( James Stanton ) for criticizing the games published under their studios ' name , seeking $ 10 million in damages for `` assault , libel , and slander '' to Romine 's business . They claimed that Stanton 's coverage of their studio 's game The Slaughtering Grounds as `` Worst Game of 2014 Contender '' was not protected under fair use law because they did not believe it was `` fair '' criticism . An additional lawsuit for $ 18 million was filed against 100 users on the Steam gaming platform for criticizing their games and business practices , which they had interpreted as `` harassment '' . The judge issued a subpoena against Valve Corporation to disclose the identities of those 100 users . This resulted in Valve removing all published games from Digital Homicide Studios . [ 21 ] It also did n't help that Romine filed the lawsuit as an individual and not as a corporation , and that such criticism is protected under the right to freedom of speech . The case was dismissed with prejudice in February 2017 . [ 22 ] This case is also an example of abuse of DMCA takedown requests on YouTube . [ 23 ]

ZURICH — My father went to war as a volunteer at age 18 . They were a submariner in the Baltic Sea .
When I was small , we lived in a basement on the Arbat , in central Moscow . Hanging on the wall above my bed was a photograph of their Shchuka-class submarine . I was terribly proud that my papa had a submarine , and I was always copying that photograph into my school notebook .
Every year on May 9 , Victory Day in Russia — marking the anniversary of the day that news of the German surrender in 1945 reached Moscow — my father would go to the closet and take out their sailor 's uniform , which required regular alteration to accommodate their growing belly , and pin on their medals . It was so important to me to be proud of my father : There had been a war and my papa had won it !
When I grew up , I realized that in 1944 and 1945 , my father was sinking ships that were evacuating German civilians and troops from Riga , in Latvia , and Tallinn , in Estonia . Hundreds , if not thousands , of people met their deaths in the waters of the Baltic — for which my father received their medals . It 's been a long time since I was proud of him , but I do n't judge him . It was war .
My father fought the evil of fascism , but they were taken advantage of by another evil . They and millions of Soviet soldiers , sailors and airmen , virtual slaves , brought the world not liberation but another slavery . The people sacrificed everything for victory , but the fruits of this victory were less freedom and more poverty .
Deforestation for products like palm oil are wreaking havoc on tiger habitat .
There are now believed to be only two viable populations of Sumatran tigers in the wild after a year-long survey found the tigers ' habitat is still being cleared for industries like palm oil .
Key points Sumatran tigers Key points : Only two populations big enough to survive long term
Tiger density increased in protected areas but decreased overall
Road building , oil palm plantations key culprits in tiger decline
Scientists estimate that the number of critically endangered tigers remaining is down to 618 as of 2012 , a reduction of more than 16 per cent on estimates since 2000 .
But critically , they say in a paper published in Nature Communications today , land clearing has fragmented many of those tigers into small , isolated groups that will not be able to survive long term .
With only two of the groups containing more than 30 breeding females , the risk of extinction of the Sumatran tiger ( Panthera tigris sumatrae ) is greater than ever , said the study 's lead author Matthew Luskin .
External Link : Sumatra landclearing
`` There are two forests that are still large enough to independently sustain tigers over the long and medium terms , '' said Dr Luskin , who conducted the research as part of their PhD at the University of California , Berkeley .
`` It 's important to get those deforestation rates down and get those parks secured because [ they are ] the last strongholds . ''
The researchers studied the tigers across a range of lowland , montane and logged habitat using hundreds of remote cameras triggered by movement .
Individual tigers were able to be identified by their unique stripe pattern which enabled the researchers to avoid duplication .
Corruption , palm oil trade paves way for wildlife poachers
Share Kerinci Seblat National Park was estimated to have 42 breeding females in 2012 .
sumatran tiger comments teaser We asked our readers what they thought could be done to protect the Sumatran tiger population .
Although habitat fragmentation caused by roads is one threat to tigers , the access the roads provide can spark a further cascade of pressures , according to Mason Campbell , a tropical ecologist at James Cook University .
`` Indonesia is investing heavily in putting in big [ roads ] through the major islands , '' Dr Campbell said .
`` These roads go in there and usually straight behind them , the first people in are the poachers — they clean out the tigers and elephants and anything else that may be of value .
`` In behind them is often the selective loggers and the illegal loggers who go in and steal some of the high-value timber . ''
According to Dr Campbell , the conservation status of forests can be downgraded after they have been logged , giving industry a foothold to begin development .
`` It 's bigger , larger , richer companies coming in , and they 're often — I 'm trying to put this politely — intricately linked with the local government officials who 've approved those roads , '' they said .
`` Once it 's a production area it 's a bit of a free-for-all for palm oil companies . ''
Hope in untouched areas
Although the researchers found an overall decline in Sumatran tiger numbers , they were encouraged to find that tiger population density had increased in areas that remained untouched .
`` The results are a mixed bag for tigers , '' Dr Luskin said .
`` Because the density of tigers increased through time in protected areas , but the total forested area had decreased at an alarming rate . ''
The World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) publishes a yearly updated scorecard that rates companies ' use of palm oil .
Whilst some retailers like Coles and Woolworths scored highly in 2017 , a number of big brand names refused to share their data .
Share Tiger density has increased in undisturbed areas of Sumatra .
Experimental Protest Chant Uses 11/8 Time
NEW YORK — Longtime political activist Lorenzo Marquez attempted to kick off a new protest chant at a march last weekend , but struggled to find followers due to the unorthodox 11/8 time signature , according to fellow marchers unable to follow the rhythm .
Sources at the pro-immigration rally reported Marquez , a performance artist involved in countless protests , spent over two hours chanting in the elusive 11/8 time signature alongside the classic , “ This is what democracy looks like , ” and “ Fuck Donald Trump. ” The avant garde chant , which counted as 1-2-3 1-2-3 1-2-3 1-2 , took the form of “ Donald Trump , Donald Trump , Donald Trump , get out ! ” Nobody , witnesses confirmed , joined in .
“ I 'm a little hurt it did n't catch on , yes , ” said Marquez . “ It 's as simple as it is brilliant . You just have to count it as three 3/8 measures and then one measure of 2/8 . Or , one measure of 6/8 , and then 5/8 after that ! Either way , it 's dead simple . ”
The experimental activist questioned whether a true progressive movement could ever take hold in America if people can not count non-traditional time signatures .
“ Simple chants in 4/4 are exactly what they are expecting . The establishment wants hand claps and rhymes . The only way to defeat the hegemony is by usurping their expectations and embracing the outré , ” said the bearded rabble-rouser .

A storied innovator , Marquez has been challenging the status quo in the world of protest chants for over two decades — their previous works include use of world 's first computer-generated protest chant at a Bush-era rally against the Iraq war . More recently , at the 2014 People 's Climate March , they unveiled a chant consisting of one long , unintelligible scream into a cracked hand mirror .
The activist remains hopeful their chant will catch on . “ I 've just learned the music played on the race results screen in Mario Kart 64 is written in 11/8 time . I 'm using this information to better reach millennials at my next protest . This is happening , ” said Marquez .
Should the 11/8 chant never catch on , though , Marquez claimed they have another experiment ready to go , inspired the by the works of musician John Cage : staying completely silent for the duration of a protest .

Student-built race car does 0-60 in 3 secs
Students in MIT Motorsports build super fast Formula SAE cars ( in red )
Deep in the recesses of the MIT Museum , one group of students is tooling . Yet no one is struggling with a pset , or studying for a test ; rather , boards are being cut , things are being welded , and the sound of power machinery is heavy on the ears . Indeed , the MIT Motorsports team is hard at work applying their knowledge to a race car .
The MIT FSAE ( Formula Society of Automotive Engineers , also known as MIT Motorsports ) designs and builds a competition Formula One race car . Made with a $ 30,000 budget , the car can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in three seconds , and can max out at a lateral 1.5 Gs — more than any street car is capable of , according to Team Manager Erich Brandeau '12 . Sporting a push-button shifter for the custom-designed Engine Control Unit and running on a tank of ethanol , the car maxes out at around 85 miles per hour .
All of these contribute to giving the MIT Motorsport Team an edge in collegiate Formula SAE compeitions , where the car is put to the test both on and off the track . The team competes once per year , usually at the FSAE West competition in Fontana , California . There , the car is judged in various events that test its design as well as its performance , comprised of three categories — Inspection , Statics , and Dynamics — which Brandeau describes as “ really intense ” .
During inspection , the vehicle is scrutinized by a team of professional engineers , where it must meet hundreds of strict requirements . First comes a visual test , where every aspect of the car is looked at to ensure safety . For instance , a driver must be able to get out of the car in five seconds , and the car . A hydraulic lift test of 45 and 60 degrees follows ; this tests the car for potential leaks and looks at its lateral acceleration . Lastly , the brakes are tested , followed by a noise test to see if the car is under the 110 decibel limit .
Static events involve all other aspects of the car that do not involve motion . The crew must justify any design choices made , and a cost report must be presented . The team presents a business model , acting as if they are a start-up company and the automobile is their product .
Finally , there are the Dynamic events . A drag race tests the car 's linear acceleration , followed by a figure eight track race to assess the lateral acceleration . The autocross track , a one kilometer level made of cones , tests the car 's maneuverability . The biggest point-getter and flagship event of the competition is the Endurance race . Most teams ca n't finish this 22 kilometer behemoth , which examines the vehicle 's reliability . MIT Motorsports was one of the few to finish last time .
This past June , MIT Motorsports placed eighth in FSAE West , the team 's highest finish ever . The main competition for MIT Motorsports is the Rochester Institute of Technology , the University of Oklahoma , and Oregon State University . Traditionally , the team designed the car the fall before the competition in June , and constructed the car from IAP to May . However , such a short turnaround proved problematic for the team .
“ It was really tight and crammed , so we wanted to think about how we can do it better , ” Brandeau says .
As a result the crew switched to a 2-year cycle , in which the car is designed and built one year , then further tested , developed and validated the next . This cycle caused FSAE to miss the 2009 competition , but the delay paid off with their 2010 success .
Currently , the cycle is at one and a half years , with one year dedicated to the car 's construction . “ Essentially , we 'll start designing at IAP for the next car even though one car is still being built and developed , ” states Brandeau .
Each year , a new car is built from scratch . Although parts may be used from previous years , a completely new construction is required . This can be due to either drastic design changes or adjustments to competition guidelines — for example , each year a noticeably different frame for the car is required .
Construction on the 2011 competition car started this past weekend , and the team 's major anticipated upgrade is improved aerodynamics . In the past , the car aerodynamics were considered to have little effect at the car 's speeds , and the team had neither the time nor the expertise to implement aerodynamic principles well .
“ Beforehand , we did n't have the resources , but now we do , ” claims Michael DeMeo '11 , the team 's new aerodynamics lead . Aside from aerodynamic improvements , new changes include a new wheel configuration , and the addition of an electronic traction control system with instant feedback .
Two years out , the group may make an electric version of the car . There is a contest for electric vehicles in Europe in particular that Brandeau has set their sights on . “ It would be pretty similar to [ the current car ] , ” they said .
Brandeau said that the most significant modification would be changing the engine to a new electrical system . If the team decides to pursue the concept , design for the electrical car would begin this IAP .
Organizationally , MIT Motorsports is divided into three groups — Chassis , Powertrain , and Management . There are usually about eight core team members in the shop throughout the year , with another two dozen coming in to help throughout the year .
Newer members generally start with building first . “ It 's a complex system , and the best way to learn about it is to build it , ” Brandeau explains .
“ But once you learn about the car and how it works and want to design something , every one 's welcome to . ”
The team was founded in 2001 , and in 2009 the Department of Mechanical Engineering offered a role in the the construction of the car as an option in the 2.007 ( Design and Manufacturing ) class . Sponsors include Ford , General Motors , the American Corn Grower 's Association , and the Edgerton Center ( who provides the machine shop and workspace ) .
The team concerns itself with teaching and learning aspects of the program over competition . As a result , not a lot of experience is required . “ I probably knew less than anyone . They turned me into something useful , ” DeMeo says .
Brandeau adds , “ The teaching and learning comes before the competitiveness . That 's not to say that racing a car is n't fun. ” They believe that such design is “ closer to the real-world ” than other clubs at MIT .
By emphasizing application , the team prides itself on it 's ability to teach others about manufacturing and car design . The group has come a long way since its inception in terms of performance , and it looks to improve upon its eighth place finish at the next competition in June . Until then , the group is always looking for ways the vehicle can be altered or improved , and they will continue to tool away ( literally ) for the next competition .
As everyone knows , the U.S. government is operating under strict austerity budgeting , pinching every penny and slashing every expense . Despite this reality , the White House still found some money to renovate its bowling alley .
Thank goodness . Now White House visitors will be spared from the horror of `` chipped lanes and worn-out shoes . '' ( Is this some Third World hellhole , or is this America ? ) According to Time :
The exclusive bowling lanes reserved for White House employees and their guests are getting an upgrade . According to a federal contractor posting , the General Services Administration is seeking to modernize the 1940s-era lanes , which were first located in the West Wing near what is now the Situation Room . The two-lane Harry S. Truman Bowling Alley was moved to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in 1955 for the use of White House staffers . The bowling alley was recently photographed by POLITICO , which described “ chipped lanes and worn-out shoes ” in the basement getaway . “ It has been fifteen years since these lanes have had any professional , industry standard maintenance , modifications , repairs or attention , ” the GSA wrote in the posting . “ They are now irreparable . ”
Irreparable ! Much like our national character , so long as our White House 's bowling alley is not up to snuff .
“ It could use [ the renovations ] , ” one recent bowler told TIME on the condition their name not be used . “ It 's quaint and feels old . There 's no electric scoreboard , so you have to score by hand—which is just debilitating when you 're focused on bowling a 300 like I am . ”
Debilitating . All Americans should be thankful that years of severe spending cuts have nevertheless left room for this critical function of government : the maintenance of a suitable bowling alley . As House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi so wisely put it , `` There 's no more cuts to make . '' None . We are down to a small military presence and our White House bowling alley .
On a side note : The poor state of the White House bowling alley could explain why President Obama is so embarrassingly terrible at bowling . At an infamous campaign event in Pennsylvania a few years back , they managed to score a mere 37 .

Paul Ryan has voted for Donald Trump .
The House speaker told Fox News on Tuesday that they pulled the lever in early voting for the GOP nominee , despite their very public , long-running standoff . Ryan reluctantly endorsed Trump in June but has kept their distance , telling Republicans last month that they would n't campaign for the nominee .
Story Continued Below
Still , Ryan has never said they would n't vote for Trump .
“ I stand where I 've stood all fall and all summer , '' the Wisconsin Republican said on `` Fox & Friends . '' `` In fact , I already voted here in Janesville for our nominee last week in early voting . ''
When asked whether they were encouraging all Republicans to support Trump , they notably answered only from their personal point of view : “ I am supporting our entire Republican ticket . I have been all along. ” ( Ryan has a number of moderate Republican colleagues who can not support Trump or they will lose their seats , so encouraging everyone to vote Trump would put them in political jeopardy . )
Ryan then made the case that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is unfit to lead .
“ The point I keep trying to make to younger voters who did not live through the 1990s is that this is what life with the Clintons looks like : It 's always a scandal , one after another . Then there is an investigation , ” they said . “ They live beyond the rules , and they live to work the system to help themselves , to help Clinton Inc . ”
“ They can win , and they could come in with a Democrat Congress — the illest of all possible things — if Republicans do n't turn out to vote , ” Ryan continued . And if they do , `` she will come with all their scandal baggage , and I do n't think that 's what the American people want to see . ”
It 's a stark change in tone from what they told House Republicans on a conference call following the revelation of the 2005 “ Access Hollywood ” video in which Trump bragged about making unwanted advances on women . Ryan made waves when they said they would neither campaign with nor defend Trump .
Republicans in the House and Trump supporters around the country blasted Ryan for the very public split . And Trump called Ryan a “ very weak leader . ”
Since then , Ryan 's office has tried to downplay their comments , noting that he 's still technically endorsing Trump even as they continued avoiding talking about them on the campaign trail .
Asked Tuesday whether they would campaign with Trump and Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker , Ryan said they `` just heard about it like 10 minutes ago . '' They said they were focused on protecting their GOP majority and making sure Minority Leader `` Nancy Pelosi does n't return as speaker of the House . ''
Indeed , their political operation on Monday announced a busy campaign schedule for the final week of the campaign , including numerous stops for vulnerable House members .
“ I am on my way right now to Indiana with one of our members running there . Then I 'm going to Michigan , then I 'm going to New York , then Virginia . I 'm just crisscrossing the country right now fighting for congressional Republicans , which is my primary responsibility right now , ” they said . “ I have a schedule that has been long in place .

On March 28 , 2014 by Alien invasion
If you care about human freedom and sovereignty , please take a minute and sign this petition against the alien invasion of this world . Your voice maters !
“ There are great spiritual powers in the universe , but do not confuse them with those who are intervening in your world , or you will make a critical and perhaps fatal error in judgment . ”
We all have our own perspectives . Five people could witness an event and see completely different things . Was the event different for each participant ? Of course not . The only difference was how they perceived it . How much more true this is for the greatest event of our times – humanity 's sustained contact with alien beings .
Correctly discerning this is challenging enough . Add in a toxic mix of deliberate disinformation combined with humanity 's proclivity for wishful thinking and you have a real uphill battle for the truth . People who agree that aliens are here can rarely agree on anything else . We each have our own pet theory or author or channeled source of information . It 's difficult to make sense of it all when everyone 's busily waiving their arms trying to get themselves heard over the crowd .
Is one theory just as good as the next ? We certainly do n't think so . On what basis should we assess them ?
Cui bono ?
Who benefits ? It 's always important to keep this in mind . Does the theory empower humanity to be a strong and free race in the universe ? Or does it disempower us in favor of aliens from distant worlds ? Many theories that paint a deeply corrupt picture of human leadership have this undertone . Does the theory propose alien guidance of human society ? That 's a red flag . Deeply consider your ideas on the alien presence . Do they really benefit humanity ?
Let 's be cautious .
Humanity is like the young country girl moving to the big city . Being too trusting fast may lead to terrible consequences . We do n't yet have the collective wisdom and experience to appropriately deal with the forces in our midst . It 's something we will learn as we go along . Until we do , we must be cautious .
Let 's consider a popular theory that sees aliens as spiritually enlightened beings here to help us . What happens if that line of thinking is completely false ? Like the country girl in the big city , humanity would have naively trusted where it should not have trusted . We wo n't necessarily have a second chance . We only have the one planet . We need to get this right .
In contrast , keeping a skeptical eye on aliens is far more sensible . If this theory is wrong and aliens are truly enlightened beings on a mission of mercy , then it 's no problem . Very little harm will have been done . Do you see the difference ?
How do you know what you know ?
“ It is something you must feel . To have a feeling orientation , your mind must be still . Truth is something you will feel with your entire body , with your entire being . ”
Where do your beliefs about the alien presence come from ? Are they facts or opinions ? What do you really know about this subject ? The alien presence is difficult to discern . What do we really know about what life is like in the universe ? What do we really know about alien motives and capabilities ?
Do not fool yourself into thinking your opinions are facts . Where do they really come from ? You read a book or watched a video and decided that you agreed most with one particular point of view . Is that enough to really understand a situation ? Even if you have first-hand experience with aliens , can you really trust what you know ? They have a habit of altering perceptions and manipulating memories . Can you trust your mind ?
Conclusion
Humans have the capacity to pierce through the veil of the deception on this topic , but it will not come from gathering information on the internet . It can only come from the Greater Mind within us – the source of truth we call Spirit or Higher Self or Christ Consciousness or Buddhanature . It is the part of us that has not left God . It can not be corrupted — even by alien technology . It is the part of you that knows . It is the only part of you that can really discern the alien invasion . Everything else is just ideas and beliefs .
Adopting a spiritual practice like Steps to Knowledge can help us reclaim our connection to the greater source of truth within us . Until we can reliably do so , it 's important to consider who benefits from a particular viewpoint , to err on the side of caution , and to always ask ourselves what we really know .
Update ( 8 pm ) : Galloway reports that Vu has resigned as an elector . Potential crisis averted !
Original story : The state of Georgia will have 16 electoral votes in this year 's presidential election . So you 'd think that would mean that if Trump won the state , he 'd get all 16 votes .
But perhaps not . Those 16 votes will all be cast by actual people — the state 's electors . And , according to a new article by the Atlantic Journal-Constitution 's Jim Galloway , one of the people who would be a Georgia elector if Trump won in the state is so anti-Trump that he 's openly musing about withholding their vote from the nominee .
Baoky Vu , a GOP activist and a vice president of a tech firm who 's on the Republicans ' elector slate , has said they will not vote for Trump in the general election because Trump 's `` antics and asinine behavior has cemented my belief that they lack the judgment , temperament , and gravitas to lead this Nation . ''
Much more importantly , Vu told Galloway that if Trump wins the state , they might well cast the electoral vote he 'd then be entitled to cast for a write-in candidate instead . `` I have the right to vote for a write-in candidate in the [ Electoral College ] , '' Vu said .
This would be very bad for democratic legitimacy . And the Electoral College should really be reformed to prevent this .
Vu is playing with fire here . If they were looking for a way to validate Trump 's currently baseless statements that the election will be `` rigged , '' they could hardly find a better one . If they followed through on what he 's suggesting here — and if other Republican electors did the same — to defy the popular will , it would wreak havoc on democratic legitimacy .
Vu 's remarks also call attention to the antiquated design of the Electoral College , which is a very strange system indeed .
Though we think of our presidential election as a democratic contest in the various states , the 538 electors who will actually pick the president are all people , often chosen through obscure processes determined by state legislatures .
It 's a system that has worked reasonably well in normal times , since the vast majority of electors tend to be party loyalists and have simply gone along with the popular vote in their states . But this odd design presents the opportunity for a lot of mischief in the event of some electoral crisis .
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , about 30 of the 50 states have passed laws `` binding '' the electors to vote in accordance with the presidential popular vote in their state . But that still leaves 20 or so states , including Georgia , that have not done so — in those states , electors are technically free to vote as they choose .
And there 's a history of rogue , faithless , or just plain incompetent electors . For instance , in 2000 an elector from Washington , DC , withheld an electoral vote from Al Gore , because they wanted to protest the fact that DC did n't have representation in Congress . In 2004 , an elector from Minnesota who was supposed to vote for John Kerry for president instead voted for John Edwards . ( It 's believed that this was an accident , but since the votes were cast anonymously , we do n't really know for sure . Great system ! )
The actual outcome of the presidential race was n't affected in either of these cases . But we could really use some reforms to ensure that our president is n't determined by the whims of a few electors .
The bad map we see every presidential election

Perto de iniciar o processo de privatização da ELETROBRAS , o governo federal quer aproveitar a oportunidade para se desfazer também de suas `` golden shares '' - ações de classe especial que são retidas pela União e que lhe garantem , entre outras coisas , poder de veto para algumas decisões importantes nas empresas vendidas à iniciativa privada .
O ministro da Fazenda , Henrique Meirelles , encaminhou ao Tribunal de Contas da União ( TCU ) uma consulta para saber como se livrar das `` golden shares '' que o governo mantém no momento em empresas como VALE , EMBRAER e Instituto de Resseguros do Brasil ( IRB ) .
Meirelles também quer que a venda da ELETROBRAS , prevista para o primeiro semestre de 2018 , ocorra sem as ações de classe especial , ao contrário do que vinha sendo dito .
O ministro entende que a `` golden share '' é mal vista pelo mercado e que tem um efeito negativo sobre o valor dos ativos .
Por isso , quer saber do TCU qual o melhor caminho para o governo se desfazer das ações sem que haja prejuízo aos interesses da União .
O pedido foi recebido com cautela no TCU , sobretudo por conta das cifras supostamente envolvidas . O entendimento , preliminar , é de que as participações especiais do governo valeriam bilhões de reais e que não poderiam simplesmente sumir .
A solução mais visível no momento é uma mudança na legislação que permita a extinção das `` golden shares '' hoje existentes mediante compensação financeira dos demais acionistas das empresas . Não se sabe , entretanto , se esses acionistas estariam dispostos a pagar e nem o valor de mercado das ações especiais .
O advogado Mauro Penteado , sócio do escritório Machado Meyer , entende que o mercado precifica essas empresas considerando o poder de veto do governo para algumas questões essenciais . Ele admite , no entanto , que não há clareza sobre como o valor de mercado das `` golden shares '' poderia ser calculado .
`` Não acho que a 'golden share ' ainda seja necessária nos dias atuais . Ela foi criada em um período em que praticamente não existia regulação . Hoje , o controle do ativo privatizado por ser facilmente feito pelo edital e pelo contrato '' , afirmou o advogado .
Na Vale e no IRB , a União tem poder de veto para alterações no controle acionário e na atividade fim da empresa . No caso da mineradora - privatizada em 1997 - , o fechamento de novos negócios , eventual troca de nome e até uma mudança da sede para exterior exigem aprovação do governo .
A União tem algumas ações dessa classe e participa do atual bloco de controle via BNDESPar , braço de participações do Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social ( BNDES ) .
No IRB , fusões , cisões e incorporações , bem como definição de políticas de resseguros podem ser vetadas pela União .
As regras das `` golden shares '' na EMBRAER , sediada em São José dos Campos ( SP ) , são mais atreladas a questões de segurança nacional . Um acionista com mais de 35 % de participação , por exemplo , tem de pedir autorização ao governo para comprar mais ações da empresa .
A fabricante de jatos comerciais , executivos e aeronaves de defesa foi privatizada em 1994 e a União detêm 0,03 % do capital . A venda da empresa inaugurou , na época , esse tipo de reserva do governo federal nas companhias privatizadas .
Essas ações são dotadas dos mesmos direitos de voto dos detentores de papéis ordinários .
Enviada com pedido de urgência em 19 de julho , a consulta de Meirelles só começou a ser apreciada pelo TCU na semana passada . Não há prazo para a área técnica emitir um parecer , que será avaliado pelo ministro José Múcio . A tendência , no entanto , é que o tribunal indique um caminho para o governo se desfazer das ações especiais . O Ministério da Fazenda não se manifestou .
Nota DefesaNet
O Secretário de Produto de Defesa ( SEPROD ) , Dr Flávio Basílio , declarou à DefesaNet que uma nova legislação está sendo proposta para as indústrias de Defesa . Ao que se chama de Base Industrial de Defesa , por legislação que a ampara deveria ser constituída por empresas brasileiras .
Isto foi publicado com exclusividade por DefesaNet , em 31OUT2016 . Esclarece o texto da agência Bloomberg que incorretamente não publicou a entrevista do Secretário da SEPROD , do MD .
Agora o Ministro da Fazenda , Henrique Meirelles , encaminhou ao Tribunal de Contas da União ( TCU ) uma consulta para saber como se livrar das `` golden shares '' que o governo mantém no momento em empresas como VALE , EMBRAER e Instituto de Resseguros do Brasil ( IRB ) .
O governo tem de combinar suas estratégias .

Henry announced on Monday that they would not be renewing their contract at New York Red Bulls Mel Evans/AP
Arsène Wenger , the Arsenal manager , has called on the French Football Federation to grant Thierry Henry a farewell appearance for their country in France 's mooted friendly against Brazil in March , suggesting it is “ the minimum ” they could do to honour the 37-year-old as they prepare for their retirement .
Henry announced on Monday that they would not be renewing their contract at New York Red Bulls after four years in the United States . They insisted that they would take some time to contemplate their next step , maintaining that they will continue to be involved in football , most likely as a coach or an executive than as a player .

Roda 1 – 1 ADO : The 4-4-2 diamond does n't help Roda at home
Roda remains unbeaten at home , but fail to win a home game again . Difficulties to convert their possession into chances which seem connected to their formation and playing style seem related to their 3-6-0 home series . ADO replaced missing winger Kubik with Vicento , a similar type of player , rather than making adjustments to their system like in the away loss at AZ and came away with a point in a game they might just have been able to win .
Roda 's 4-4-2 diamond
Manager Harm van Veldhoven has their team play a 4-4-2 diamond as regular followers of 11tegen11 would know . This formation seems to suit their players quite well , allowing Vormer to excel in a holding midfield role and having Jansen put in their hard-working game behind the striker pair of Hadouir for creativity and Junker for finishing .
As the famous Dutch philosopher Cruijff once put it , every advantage has its disadvantage . Such is also the case with Roda 's formation . While operating from a strong narrow midfield the diamond certainly strengthens the center of the pitch , at the same time making it vulnerable to either wide formations or teams able to quickly circulate the ball from one flank to the other .
ADO 's 4-3-3
And that 's where ADO 's formation comes into the equation . Operating as a wide 4-3-3 , both home and away , ADO is a team set-up around an outside winger philosophy and the fact that ADO has won as many points at home as they did in away games goes to illustrate this . In this match ADO misses left winger Frantisek Kubik due to suspension . In their previous match , against AZ , ADO missed their other winger , Verhoek and was punished for replacing them with Ricky Van den Bergh , a very different type of player . Well , Van den Bergh is not just out of the team , he 's out of the club too as they decided that a fringe role was not what they themselves had in mind . This time manager Van den Brom replaced the missing winger with a similar type of player , Vicento .
Two quick goals
The game started of with two early goals . First Roda opened the score through Willem Janssen who finished off a Junker pass after displaying their aerobic skills in a run from their own half , ending up with a close range finish of a quick counter . An individual error by holding midfielder Radosavljevic , generally quite reliable in keeping possession , formed the base of conceding the goal . They did the one thing you would not want a holding midfielder to do : dwelling on the ball with most of their teammates in front of him .
But just as quick as Roda 's opening goal , they conceded one themselves . Pa-Modou Kah left Bulykin too much space at a corner and the Russian scored their eleventh goal of the season to level the score after thirteen minutes of play .
The pattern of the first half
Well , there was not so much one pattern on show as both teams kept on adjusting to each other , which was also a great game to watch . ADO started the game quite offensively , as expected . A tell tale of their intentions was the frequent runs from deep from the full-backs and the offensive stance of their wingers , pinning Roda 's full-backs back . This derived Roda from one of their strategies to provide width to their diamond , but there was another strategy left .
Striker Hadouir and attacking midfielder Janssen smartly took advantage of ADO 's advanced full-backs and got in behind them on more than one occasion . In turn , this led to ADO adjusting their full-backs and taking a deeper stance in general . This diminished the pressure on Roda 's midfield , who suddenly found lots of space to pass the ball around . ADO could not let this happen and ended the first half applying more of the much-needed pression , making life more difficult for Roda 's midfielders . All in all it was a balanced situation with both sides generating some chances , but no more first half goals .
The second half
ADO 's pressing continued in the starting minutes of the second half and Roda 's passing suffered as a consequence . ADO took control of the game , but their finishing was rarely on target . Feeling the pressure of being the home team , and although unbeaten at home , also having drawn no less than five of their eight home games , Roda refused to sit back under ADO 's pressure . This initially led to a series of ADO through-balls and crosses , but gradually the match balanced out as ADO 's players paid the price for pressing a lot early in the game .
Particularly in the second half Roda 's passing was below-par , often ending their offensive moves before they actually started . As the same problem kicked in near the end of the match for the fatigued ADO players too , the final part of the match was hardly the best . Both teams gradually came to realize that a draw was on the cards .
In the end
Another game unbeaten at home for Roda , but also another game they failed to win . A 3-6-0 home record will not be enough for Roda to build upon and a relation with their playing style may be seen here . Their 4-4-2 diamond allows for a grouped defense , but the lack of width makes it difficult for their players to find space in possession and as a consequence the pass completion suffers . Being a top half side brings that most opponents will settle for a draw playing Roda away and Roda 's strongpoint of fast counter-attacks is hardly effective in these situations .
ADO will be the happier side although more clinical finishing could have won them the game , particularly early in the second half . Their style of play is based on the old adage of cropping space in defense and stretching play in possession and they do this very well . Manager John van den Brom spent their first three coaching years at Ajax ' youth and the Ajax way of thinking is reflected in their approach . The 4-3-3 wide winger system is a clear example of course , but they have adapted this style well to suit their current squad . Reverting the midfield triangle , making the arrow point backwards and installing an anchorman in front of defense reflects the fact that Van den Brom smartly adjusts their philosophy to the strength of the squad he 's managing . ADO 's current eighth spot is quite something for an Eredivisie manager making their debut .

In May , Fantagraphics is set to publish the twenty-fifth and penultimate collection of Charles Schulz ' masterpiece The Complete Peanuts , which will include Schulz 's final Peanuts strip from February 2000 . In order to celebrate this momentous publication , Fantagraphics reached out to the the forty-fourth President of the United States , Barack Obama , about the possibility of writing a foreword , and to their surprise , they said yes .
According to a piece published today by The Guardian , President Obama says that they never outgrew Peanuts , and refers to the strip , which ran for fifty years , as “ Groundbreaking ” and “ An American treasure . ”
For decades , Peanuts was our own daily security blanket . That 's what makes Peanuts an American treasure .
Barack Obama has been one of the most culturally aware presidents of recent memory through their two terms in office , and regularly releases end-of-year lists of their and First Lady Michelle Obama 's favourite media . In 2016 , they cited Kendrick Lamar 's How Much A Dollar Cost as their favourite song , and Ridley Scott 's The Martian as their favorite film .
The twenty-fifth volume of The Complete Peanuts covers the final year of the strip , which ended on February 13th 2000 , one day after Charles Schulz 's death . The collection also features Schulz ' Li ' l Folks , the weekly one panel comic that served as the precursor to Peanuts . The twenty-sixth and final volume will follow in October , reprinting Peanuts art by Charles Schulz that was n't from the cartoon strip .
The Complete Peanuts Volume 25 is released in the U.S. on 10th May from Fantagraphics .
Ayik , pictured , was stunned to come across the man who tortured him . Credit : SBS Now – as they glared at their tormenter across the aisle – they plotted their revenge . `` Why do n't I just kill him ? '' they thought . Then they got up and walked out , unsure if he 'd ever return . `` I did n't want to see them again , '' they say , `` because I did n't know what I was capable of doing to him . '' So when Ayik spotted a casting call on Facebook , they were intrigued . It was for Look Me In The Eye , a new SBS series hosted by Ray Martin . The format is simple : two estranged people come face-to-face . Without speaking , they stare into the other 's eyes for five minutes . Afterwards , they decide whether to start a conversation . The show features a couple who have separated , a son who cut off their mother and a father who abandoned their daughter . Of course , Ayik and Anyang do n't fit the traditional definition of `` estranged '' , as they had never been close .
Ayik , left , confronts Anyang on SBS 's Look Me In The Eye . Yet Ayik was determined to seize this opportunity . `` I did n't know if Anyang would turn up , but I did n't care , '' they tell Fairfax Media . `` I just wanted to talk to Ray Martin . I was going to forgive Anyang [ even if I did n't see him ] so the memories would n't haunt me . '' Ayik weeps as they speak with Anyang . Credit : SBS What eventuated was a gut-wrenching scene , almost painful to watch .
First , Ayik detailed their abuse to Martin . When they were small , their father was killed in the war . At 13 , they enrolled in military training in Ethiopia , to fight for their people . The Red Army , as it was known , trained boys as young as 10 , equipping them with AK-47s . But Ayik did n't anticipate the deprivation of food and sleep . They made 15 attempts to flee . Each time , they were captured and tortured . From hatred to forgiveness : Ayik , left , embraces Anyang . Credit : SBS Then we learned that Anyang , though older than Ayik , also joined the military as a boy . They had little choice ; having lost their father , mother and two siblings . A few years later , Anyang was given a `` promotion '' : the authority to punish escapees by tying them up and lashing them with a cane . Had they refused , they would have been beaten . Anyang , right , breaks down while hugging Ayik . Credit : SBS
With the cameras rolling , Ayik and Anyang take their seats . Ayik weeps , Anyang does n't shed a tear . `` My mind is just looking , looking at their eyes , '' a devastated Ayik says afterwards . `` I did n't feel anything . I did n't feel he 's sorry . '' Ayik , left , and their son Freeman are open to a friendship with Anyang . Credit : SBS Even so , they insist on speaking with Anyang . They tell them he 'd wished for their death . How rage once consumed him , making them smash windows and televisions . `` I prayed to god you were killed in the war ... no one hurt me like you did , no one . '' Then Ayik mentions their son , Freeman . The safe childhood he 's worked hard to give him . Their desire to live for the future , instead of being traumatised by their past .
While Anyang says the right things , they seem curiously unemotional . Only when they request a parting hug do they break down . They have to excuse himself , knowing they wo n't stop crying if they do n't . Since filming that episode , Ayik has seen Anyang twice . `` I would n't call them a close friend now , but if they want to be friends in the long-term , I 'm happy to accept that . `` Of course I 'll see them again . I 've learned something in life : you can forgive anyone . '' Remarkably , they introduced Anyang to Freeman . `` When I was in the army , I would n't leave anyone next to Anyang , '' they say . `` Now , I could leave my son with them for a day and not worry . ''
Ayik can see that Anyang is scarred by the war , but hopes they find contentment . Loading `` Out of millions of Africans , we got to come here . Australia saved my life and Anyang 's life ; Australia gave me a new life with my little boy . I could n't think of any other name for them except Freeman – because they are a free man .

Today 's contributor is Patricia from The Wood Spa and they are a sharing a tutorial on how to paint an ombre dresser . All posts contributed by Patricia for Grillo Designs can be found HERE .
I 'm always pinning and saving pictures of ombre dressers from the Internet , but I had never painted one until recently . They make me smile with their fun colors and beautiful shades and I think they look especially nice in children 's bedrooms .
I will show you step by step how I painted this blue ombre dresser for a little boy 's bedroom . The original piece had been in their father bedroom since they were a little kid and after all these years it was still in very good shape .
This is how it looked before .
SUPPLIES USED TO CREATE THIS OMBRE DRESSER EFFECT :
This post contains affiliate links for your convenience – please see full disclosure here
HOW TO :
I started by cleaning the piece with TSP diluted in water and paper towel , then light sanding it with a 120 grit sand block .
Next I cleaned it again then sprayed Rustoleum gray primer over the entire piece .
This is how it looked after I primed it .
This chest had very few scratches , and since I could hardly see them in the original finish , I chose to fix the imperfections after it was all primed . I applied wood filler using a putty knife , and after an hour sanded the filled spots with a 220 grit sand paper . I then cleaned and sprayed the primer only on those spots .
The main color I used was Benjamin Moore Hale Navy ( satin ) . I sprayed two coats on the main body of the chest using my Homeright paint sprayer .
Next I got to the fun part ! Mixing paint to make the other five shades of blue to paint the drawers .
There was no exact recipe to make the other shades . I chose to make very subtle variations of the main blue because I wanted the final look to be mostly dark . It is a personal choice . I 've seen ombré pieces where the shades have a higher contrast among themselves and the last drawer is totally white . Also very beautiful !
To make the darkest shade I added a little bit of white paint ( Benjamin Moore Super White ) to the Hale Navy blue .
I mixed it well and painted a small piece of wood . I used little pieces of wood to compare each new shade to the other ones . If I thought it was too dark or too light I did the necessary adjustments by adding more white or more blue to my paint , always trying it on the little piece of wood FIRST before moving to the actual drawer .
I also kept a small container with each shade of blue I used , so they can be used in case some touch-up is needed during the project or in the future .
When I was happy with my first shade , I rolled two coats on the bottom drawer using my very favorite foam roller .
This roller makes a very smooth finish and it 's the closest you can get to a spray painted finish .
I repeated the process for the other four shades , always painting small pieces of wood before painting the drawer , and saving a little container of each shade .
I sealed the finished piece with Polycrylic spray , satin .
And here is the final result !
Have you got a similar piece ? Are you planning to do your own ombré dresser ? Let me know if I can help ! Also , here are some of my other painted furniture transformations from my blog .

Obama received $ 20 million from healthcare industry in 2008 campaign
“ What it also means when you look at it just on its own merit is that Obama definitely has a relationship with the health sector , ” Levinthal told Raw Story . “ When you raise $ 20 million from one group , obviously they 've curried some favor with you and you have a lot of people in that sector who support you . Some experts who spoke with Raw Story also noted the rather stark evolution from candidate Obama , who once advocated for universal healthcare and was a vocal critic of mandated health insurance , to President Obama , who excluded single-payer advocates from White House healthcare summits and who has since strongly embraced mandates . Historian and media critic Norman Solomon , who was also an Obama delegate to the Democratic National Convention , called the president 's transformation on healthcare since taking office “ shameful … corporate friendly in a way that I believe is injurious to public health . ”
The Raw Story , January 12 , 2009
Obama received $ 20 million from healthcare industry in 2008 campaign
Almost three times the amount given to McCain
While some sunlight has been shed on the hefty sums shoveled into congressional campaign coffers in an effort to influence the Democrats ' massive healthcare bill , little attention has been focused on the far larger sums received by President Barack Obama while they were a candidate in 2008 .
A new figure , based on an exclusive analysis created for Raw Story by the Center for Responsive Politics , shows that President Obama received a staggering $ 20,175,303 from the healthcare industry during the 2008 election cycle , nearly three times the amount of their presidential rival John McCain . McCain took in $ 7,758,289 , the Center found .
The new figure , obtained by Raw Story through an independent custom research request performed by the Center for Responsive Politics — a nonprofit , nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics — is the most comprehensive breakdown yet available of healthcare industry contributions to Obama during the 2008 election cycle .
Currently , the Center 's website shows that Obama received $ 19,462,986 from the health sector , which includes health professionals ( $ 11.7m ) , health services/HMOs ( $ 1.4m ) , hospitals/nursing homes ( $ 3.3m ) and pharmaceuticals/health products ( $ 2.1m ) . Miscellaneous health donations ( from which Obama received $ 860,411 ) are also factored into the current total health sector numbers but are not accessible on the site .
Health insurance industry contributions , however , are not included within the Center 's current health sector totals . Rather , contributions from the health insurance industry are contained within the site 's finance and insurance sector . Seeking a more complete total , the Center culled health and accident insurance donations from this sector ( for which Obama received $ 712,317 ) and combined them with their existing health sector total ( $ 19,462,986 ) to arrive at their healthcare industry total ( $ 20,175,303 ) .
rsilogo Obama received $ 20 million from healthcare industry in 2008 campaignThe Center employed the same methodology in its analysis for John McCain and based all of its findings on the latest data released by the Federal Election Commission .
Dave Levinthal , the Center 's communications director , noted that Obama out-raised McCain in nearly all business sectors that contributed to the 2008 presidential candidates . In that regard , the healthcare industry figure is not in itself an anomaly .
But Levinthal underscored the significance of the industry 's largess .
“ What it also means when you look at it just on its own merit is that Obama definitely has a relationship with the health sector , ” Levinthal told Raw Story . “ When you raise $ 20 million from one group , obviously they 've curried some favor with you and you have a lot of people in that sector who support you . So to say that just because they out-raised McCain overall does n't mean anything in the context of the health sector might not necessarily be true . ”
“ People want to be able to curry favor with those who are in power , ” they added . “ And one way to do that is by making donations to candidates and officials who are represented by the party in power . Or who look like they 're going to win . ”
The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article .
Gary Jacobson , a campaign finance expert and political science professor at the University of California , San Diego , says the healthcare industry saw the writing on the wall and sought to “ protect their interests . ”
“ Contributors expect access , ” Jacobson , author of Money in Congressional Elections , told Raw Story . The healthcare industry “ anticipated an Obama victory and they wanted to be in the game . ”
While experts agreed that there is certainly nothing illegal about receiving such copious contributions from the industry within the current U.S. system of campaign financing , all emphasized the inevitable impact this money has in influencing public policy .
Obama 's considerable windfall from the healthcare industry merits attention , they said .
Mary Boyle , spokesperson for government watchdog Common Cause , said that their organization has been mostly focused on what members of Congress have received in campaign contributions from the healthcare industry . But they called Obama 's campaign receipts from the industry “ not surprising . ”
“ The healthcare industry has been ramping up in recent years in anticipation of this healthcare debate , giving both to Democrats and Republicans , ” Boyle explained in an interview with Raw Story .
Some experts who spoke with Raw Story also noted the rather stark evolution from candidate Obama , who once advocated for universal healthcare and was a vocal critic of mandated health insurance , to President Obama , who excluded single-payer advocates from White House healthcare summits and who has since strongly embraced mandates .
Obama delegate now takes umbrage with healthcare position
Historian and media critic Norman Solomon , who was also an Obama delegate to the Democratic National Convention , called the president 's transformation on healthcare since taking office “ shameful . ”
“ Overall it 's been a very corporate friendly healthcare approach from Obama as president , ” Solomon said in an interview with Raw Story . “ Corporate friendly in a way that I believe is injurious to public health . ”
They underscored the subtle but substantive change in healthcare language used by Obama and the White House .
“ We do n't hear so much now about ‘ healthcare reform , ' ” Solomon said . “ We 're hearing a lot more about ‘ health insurance reform . ' And that is absolutely in large measure driven by the White House . ”
They also concurred with Boyle 's assessment on the success of the industry 's special interests .
“ The funding from the healthcare industry to the Obama campaign , in retrospect , was not misplaced , ” Solomon said . “ It appears , based on policy , that those funders are getting what they would 've hoped for . ”
“ Let me put it this way , ” they added . “ Single-payer advocates literally could n't get into the White House . And you have [ chief pharmaceutical industry lobbyist and former Republican member of congress ] Billy Tauzin and Big Pharma and all of these in-depth strategy meetings in the White House in mid-2009 cutting deals . And I think it 's shameful . ”
But Boyle puts the blame more on the campaign financing system than on President Obama .
“ It 's getting worse every year , ” they said . “ This story line is going to continue until the end of time until we change the way we pay for our political campaigns . It 's the system . Everyone 's stuck in it . Everyone gets kind of caught up in it . ”
Yet they believe these new numbers clearly show the industry was “ trying to gain access and influence to the president , just as they have tried — and been quite successful — at gaining access to members of Congress . ”
Boyle also noted the industry 's success in achieving this goal over the course of the healthcare debate .
“ We 've seen many examples of the healthcare industry 's interests – and we would argue that a lot of it has to do with the money – prevailing over the public interest , ” they said . “ The fact is , we have this broken system that allows interests that want the most out of government to have the loudest voice and to get that loudest voice by contributing the most money and spending the most money . ”

Which leaves two more complicated contenders : the
Bugatti Veyron and the Pagani Huayra . Side by side on the strip , the standard
Veyron is very similar to the P1 in terms of acceleration , and the SuperSport
is definitely faster . There , I 've said it . It would n't leave the P1 for dead ,
but the SS has the edge in terms of sheer grunt . Despite weighing 400kg more ,
that 300bhp power advantage tells .
But the P1 makes any Veyron feel like an Audi TT
in terms of driver enjoyment . The Veyron has a massive thousand-horsepower ,
all-wheel-drive party trick that never gets boring , one that 's even more
addictive in 1200bhp SS flavour . The P1 , on the other hand , is intimate in a
way that the Veyron can never be , connected to the driver on a different level .
You pilot a Veyron , but you have to drive a P1 .
That ends up being a bit of a double-edged sword .
You can point a Veyron in the right direction and more-or-less just hit it – it
will look after you to a greater extent , and it makes a faintly ludicrous
amount of horsepower not just deployable , but actively useable . But it will
reach a point where it simply understeers and loses focus .
The rear-wheel drive P1 is not so accommodating ,
and will take a lot longer to learn to drive to the limit , but will be
infinitely more satisfying once you start to push that particular dangerous
envelope . Around a track or on a winding route , the P1 will be a good deal
further down the road than the Veyron , but the driver will be working harder
and thinking more .
Which kind of brings us to what you want from a
very , very fast car . If you just desire the Top Trumps angle , to be the
‘ fastest ' , then the Veyron SS is still the king . But if you want to be more
involved in the thrill of it , then the P1 has found a new niche .
You can see where McLaren have gone with the
pitch . Instead of chasing top speed ( I reckon the P1 is easily a 250mph car if
de-restricted ) , the P1 has opted to keep the car relatively light and engineer
for sub-150mph . The extra braking/cooling/aero/stability needed to make a
250mph top speed possible tends to have an adverse effect on other factors . The
P1 makes those differences crystal .

The PNP chief also says key legislation is needed to support the crackdown on the drug trade in the Philippines
Published 2:50 PM , September 26 , 2016
MANILA , Philippines – `` You want me to confirm it ? So the drug lords begin leaving this country ? Go abroad . You drug lords , it 's time to flee . I 'll make an even stronger version of Colombia 's Search Bloc . ''
Philippine National Police ( PNP ) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa may have been laughing when they issued this `` warning '' during a press conference in Camp Crame on Monday , September 26 , but they were dead serious about the possibility of forming a Philippine version of Colombia 's Search Bloc as part of the government 's efforts to curb the spread of illegal drugs .
The Search Bloc is a special Colombian police force that targets wanted and dangerous personalities or groups . At the height of Colombia 's war on drugs in the 90s , the Search Bloc specifically targeted the Medellin drug cartel and its leader , Pablo Escobar . The infamous cartel leader was eventually gunned down in a 1993 shootout with the Search Bloc .
Pressed if they were serious about taking a page from the Search Bloc , Dela Rosa quipped : `` Well , I was n't supposed to say it because if I do , our plans might become ineffective . But since you asked , okay . That 's part of it too . ''
WATCH : Will the PH form a unit similar to Colombia 's `` Search Bloc '' for anti illegal drugs ops ? # WarOnDrugs pic.twitter.com/sX5Pw0kqXf — Bea Cupin ( @ beacupin ) September 26 , 2016
The PNP chief added that their trip to Colombia was `` very productive . '' Dela Rosa visited the South American country for several days for a series of meetings and tours with the country 's police force .
Colombia was among the world 's top producers of cocaine . At one point in the 90s , the United States and Colombia signed an extradition deal to try and jail Colombian drug lords according to US laws .
Violence in parts of the country escalated as drug cartels fought back against the government 's crackdown on their illegal activities . Today , Colombia is among the world 's leaders in advocating for a new approach to solving the problem of narcotics .
Colombian President Juan Miguel Santos has called on the United Nations ( UN ) to reform its international drug policy . After the UN policy summit decided to keep its support of `` prohibitionist '' drug policy , Santos told The Guardian : `` Let me be clear with them : the prohibitionist approach has been a failure . ''
Experts have tagged Colombia 's war on drugs as a failure but Dela Rosa , who spoke to former and current Colombian police chiefs during their visit , said that the failure was because of their inability to address the demand side of the illegal drugs equation .
Legislative push
Among Dela Rosa 's key learnings from Colombia , they said , was the `` effective legislation '' passed by the country 's Congress to aid anti-narcotics efforts .
The PNP chief noted that anti-wiretapping laws in Colombia cover anti-narcotics operations and only need the permission of a prosecutor – or a fiscal – and not a court judge like in the Philippines . ( READ : Best practices : How other countries dealt with drug problems )
Properties proven to be `` fruits of the crime , '' or properties acquired through drug money , Dela Rosa added , can be seized by government .
`` For example , in the case of the Odicta couple . They have a lot of properties . If the police proves that the properties were acquired through their illegal drugs activities , it would be forfeited in favor of the government . That 's how effective their laws are , '' said the PNP chief .
The Philippine Senate is currently holding hearings for possible amendments to the anti-wiretapping law . Currently , the law only exempts wiretapping for anti-terrorism efforts .
Equipment is also where Colombia has a clear edge over the Philippines ' police force . `` They pour all their resources when it comes to anti-narcotics operations . Their directorate for anti-narcotics has 60 Black Hawk helicopters , they have 50 fixed-wing aircraft for their operations . Their airplanes are like taxis . That 's how good the lives of police there are . All support is given to them , '' Dela Rosa said .
A campaign to curb crime , illegal drugs , and corruption was among President Rodrigo Duterte 's main promises during the 2016 elections . Since July 1 , law enforcers have been waging an `` all-out war '' against drug traffickers and users in the country .
As of September 26 , police have killed more than 1,200 drug suspects in operations around the country . Another 20,000 or so drug users and pushers have been arrested . At least 13 cops , meanwhile , have been killed during anti-illegal drugs operations . ( LOOK : IN PHOTOS : Police take war on drugs to Happyland )
In an interview with ABS-CBN News in Colombia , Dela Rosa noted `` similarities '' between the problems of Colombia and the Philippines .
`` Their experience is the same as ours . They have a drug trafficking problem . They have a problem with the FARC rebellion . Terrorism is a problem , and so is corruption . Those are the problems they faced before they won . So we are trying to [ learn from them ] . They have been there , they have done that . And the Colombian government was successful , '' they said .
This year , the Philippines resumed peace talks with communist rebels in a bid to end Asia 's longest-running communist insurgency .
Colombia 's war on drugs has since moved on to fighting `` small organized crime groups , '' after the big drug cartels such as the Medellin and Cali cartels were dismantled .
The PNP and other Philippine law enforcement agencies initially had 6 months to finish their campaign against drugs but Duterte has since asked for an additional 6 months . ( READ : Dela Rosa thankful for 'war on drugs ' extension ) – Rappler.com
Yesterday 's Fab.com email , contained a “ stylish steel pen ” called the Torr Classic . Surprising to see a very familiar rectangular steel sleeve with a ruler on it and cylindrical pen insert . Something definitely did n't feel right…
Realizing it was extremely close to the CW & T Pen Type-A , which was one of the most funded early Kickstarter projects , that we have… i could n't help but wonder if they were connected .
Torr 's site was a surprise as well - Steven Tyler from Aerosmith “ smoking ” a Torr Classic ? A half built template feeling website with broken links and images with painful fonts ? As for the pen… the differences Torr has are a secret capsule , “ versatile ink ” , and personalized engraving . The Facebook page is slim , they have not tweeted , and the Google+ link is broken .
There is even a “ James Bond Parody ” short film where a man in tux throws their Torr Classic at a bad guy 's jugular…
A Kickstarter update from CW & T comes out last night… not only confirming that they are not involved with the Torr , but that the man we see all over the Torr website and Fab.com page is the man who “ saved ” them during their earlier manufacturing fiasco in china , and has been working closely with them for the last year to produce their pens !
Re-reading the updates from the kickstarter , the images of the same man and references to “ Allen and Diana ” are unmissable .
They and their girlfriend even worked a few late nights with them assembling the pens for shipping .
Curiosity led to Allen Areseneau 's linkedin - and JOIGA , the manufacturing company that CW & T hired to fabricate the Pen Type-A - interesting that the company even lists “ providing legal protection in the US and in China ” …
What a heinous situation to end up in ! And the Pen Type-A kickstarter story has certainly become a valuable lesson to all in manufacturing , doing business , and how the world works…
On happier news , after a very frustrating time in China , they are now made in the USA !
… In a multi-generational family run machine shop in Vermont ! It 's not hard to see how much love , precision , and passion go into the CW & T Pen Type-A !
… and how clear the quality and philosophical differences between Torr and CW & T are…
So the bottom line is , be careful who you work with , make sure you have ample legal protection of your work , and SUPPORT AWESOME DESIGN !
UPDATES
… Thrilled to hear Fab.com has pulled the sale !
… Awesome to see that a lot of people who have kickstarted the Pen Type-A are so supportive and understanding ( and outraged ! ) in their comments
… Torr Pens has added an inspiration and design page - also some interesting comments .
… Torr Pens seems to have wiped the Inspiration and Design page above of all content sharing their inspiration and previous designs which inspired it ( including the Pen Type-A ) and the comment discussion that followed .

Problem Description :
Hi ,
it would be nice to have a Reverse-String cmdlet . One that takes a string and reverse it . For example , `` asdf '' becomes `` fdsa '' .
It could be aliased to rs ( for reverse-string ) .
The reverse method for [ array ] is ok , but having a cmdlet and/or a [ string ] method . would be better .
Other well-known languages have routines for this :
For instance in Perl 6 you have the flip routine , which returns the string reversed character by character .
`` Perl '' .flip ; # lreP
`` ABBA '' .flip ; # ABBA
Ruby has a reverse method :
str = `` asdf ''
reversed = str.reverse
Thanks
Carlo

9 Lies You 've Been Told About Work
Matt Orfalea Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 25 , 2015
1 . “ You are lucky to have a job ”
We hear it all the time . But there is nothing lucky about spending most of your waking hours doing whatever someone else tells you to . You might be lucky if you really enjoy doing what you are doing ( because that is unfortunately rare ) . But for having a job you hate…like the majority of the population ? That is the opposite of lucky : common and unfortunate .
2 . “ You get paid what you 're worth . ”
Human potential is limitless but time is limited . That makes everyone 's time a precious resource . Sadly the pervasive culture does not value human potential…other than the potential to make money . You get paid what you 're worth to your employer , which is often just enough to keep you desperate enough to continue to work for their benefit .
3 . “ You need a job to be productive . ”
Are consultants consulting consultants on how to consult consultants…productive ? Probably not . All employment implies is that you are getting a paycheck . Employment does not equal productivity . It is a myth that those who work regular jobs are “ productive members of society ” . In fact those with the highest paying jobs are often among the most counter-productive members of society . Take for example the rich investment bankers who destroyed the economy , or the oil companies destroying ecosystems .
It 's actually surprisingly common for unemployed to be more productive than your typical paid employee .
A good mother , for example , works nearly 100 hrs a week raising a child . It is among the most demanding and important work there is . The future of society quite literally depends on their work raising the next generations .
It pays nothing . There is no connection between work and productivity ; no connection between monetary value and real world value .
4 . “ Good companies are good employers . ”
They hire you to make money for them , not to be your friend . If they can make more replacing you with technology or someone more naïve and financially desperate , they will .
5 . “ The unemployed are lazy . ”
If you 're unemployed that does not mean you 're lazy . Looking and applying for work is hard work . And so is accomplishing anything without the financial and social support of a job . I mean really , who 's less lazy ? The unemployed with the self discipline to pursue things on his/her own without oversight or payment ? Or the employee who does little else than what they are told to do ?
6 . “ Work is life 's mission . ”
“ How 's work ? ” “ What do you do [ for work ] ? ” are the first things people ask , so naturally we 've come to believe they are the most important . We are told we have to go to school for 18+ yrs of our lives…to get a job . Not to learn , not to find our passion . Not to question authority , not to add value to society .
We are raised to make money . But there is so much more to live for…those basic human goals , we all too often put aside to for work…like happiness , health , knowledge , love , and progress .
7 . “ Everyone needs to earn a living . ”
This was true when one had to literally work the fields for food to live . That is no longer the case . It used to take 90 % of the workforce to feed ourselves . Now it takes only 1.7 % .
Of course we still need to work to continue innovation and progress . But we no longer need to work simply to live . For example in the US we throw away 40 % of the food we produce and there are 6 vacant homes for each homeless American . We are quite literally living in an age of abundance . But our system of money and workaholic culture keeps us from realizing it .
8 . “ If you work hard… ”
If you worked hard enough in school and got good enough grades it used to mean you 'd be able to get a good job.— That 's just not true anymore .
9 . “ I ca n't find any work . ”
There 's a huge shortage of jobs , especially meaningful ones . But there 's still work to be done . Just look around : We have growing income inequality , poverty , and global warming , among other issues .
It will take tremendous amounts of work to fix our problems . It 's just that nobody 's creating sufficient jobs to do the work that needs to be done . Because it 's not profitable . Or at least not as profitable as gambling on the stock market…
I say the best way to get work done is to just give everybody money .
That would give everyone a job to do whatever they want . And most people want to do work that matters . This idea is Unconditional Basic Income , which is being discussed seriously all around the world as a solution to poverty and all the cruel inefficiencies of work .

Sarah Palin , June 3 :
`` We need to be aware of the creation of a fearful population , and fearful lawmakers , being led to believe that big government is the answer , to bail out the private sector , because then government gets to get in there and control it , '' they said . `` And mark my words , this is going to be next , I fear , bail out next debt-ridden states . Then government gets to get in there and control the people . ''
Today :
Calif. Aid Request Spurned By U.S. Officials Push State To Repair Budget The Obama administration has turned back pleas for emergency aid from one of the biggest remaining threats to the economy -- the state of California . Top state officials have gone hat in hand to the administration , armed with dire warnings of a fast-approaching `` fiscal meltdown '' caused by a budget shortfall . Concern has grown inside the White House in recent weeks as California 's fiscal condition has worsened , leading to high-level administration meetings . But federal officials are worried that a bailout of California would set off a cascade of demands from other states .
Who knows ? Perhaps the Palin conspiracy trolling will turn out to be accurate . But so far , she 's wrong .
While we 're at it , it 's worth noting that ( 1 ) while California gets back $ 0.78 for every dollar it pays in federal taxes , Alaska gets $ 1.84 and ( 2 ) even if the federal government did offer some form of temporary assistance , the notion that providing such aid would mean the `` government gets to get in there and control the people '' is absolutely crazy .
No wonder they want to talk about late night comedy shows -- she 's a joke .
If we do n't romanticize illness , that 's not to say that our “ realism ” is n't full of denial . Over and over writers express surprise that their minds really are housed in bodies . After their own cancer diagnosis , Anatole Broyard wrote , in a piece that initially appeared in The New York Times Magazine in 1989 , that while the diagnosis did n't make them believe that cancer “ was going to kill me ” ( although of course it did ) , “ what struck me was the startled awareness that one day something , whatever it might be , was going to interrupt my leisurely progress . It sounds trite , yet I can only say that I realized for the first time that I do n't have forever. ” In notes appended to “ Mortality , ” Hitchens observes : “ Always prided myself on my reasoning faculty and my stoic materialism . I do n't have a body , I am a body . Yet consciously and regularly acted as if this was not true , or as if an exception would be made in my case . ”
The process of diminishment is at once a galvanizing subject for the writer and a terrifying one : Will it silence me before I get to describe it ? You can not describe what ca n't ultimately be endured . And as fascinating as these documentary works are , they are necessarily limited . The writers ca n't write the final chapter of the work they 're making , because the final chapter is death ; in this sense , they remain strangely fictive . The reader fills in the blanks . In fact , the eighth chapter of “ Mortality ” consists of Hitchens 's jotted notes — the most affecting possible conclusion , more emphatically conveying the reality of wasting away than any elegantly wrought essay might . This failure is necessary to their power , even if the reader craves , sometimes , the shaped piece , the finished object . As Anatole Broyard wrote , “ Stories are antibodies against illness and pain . ”
THE literature of AIDS clearly helped pave the way for the new openness about what it 's like to die . The disease 's most deadly era saw a proliferation of illness memoirs written by caretakers ( some of whom themselves fell ill while writing ) , including Paul Monette 's “ Borrowed Time ” ( 1988 ) and Mark Doty 's “ Heaven 's Coast ” ( 1996 ) . Because these memoirs were not only literary accounts but profound acts of social witness — humanizing the tragedy and helping wash away its stigma — they opened a space for a kind of writing about death that Americans might previously have considered morbid . ( Recall that it was n't until the 1970s that doctors regularly began to tell patients with fatal diseases that they were dying ; previously , it was considered better to keep the bad news from the terminally ill . )
Among my favorite works of that era are Tim Dlugos 's late poems . They have the jaunty “ I did this , I did that ” style of Frank O'Hara , inflected with the gravitas of death . Dlugos takes stock , like others , of the physical degradation of the body , “ the shiny / hamburger-in-lucite look / of the big lesion on my face ; / the smaller ones I daub / with makeup ; the loss / of forty pounds in a year. ” But they also searched for meaning in their suffering , concluding : “ The symptoms float like algae / on the surface of the grace / that buoys me up today. ” Their work is remarkable , pivoting from bald reportage on a friend 's outcry — “ ‘ I hate this , I hate your / being sick and having AIDS / and lying in a hospital / where I can only see you / with a visitor 's pass ' ” — to transcendent hope :
When
Joe O'Hare flew in last week ,
they asked what were the best
times of my New York years ;
I said “ Today , ” and meant it .
I hope that death will lift me
by the hair like an angel
in a Hebrew myth , snatch me with
the strength of sleep 's embrace ,
and gently set me down
where I 'm supposed to be ,
in just the right place .
But for me the great poem of protracted death is James Merrill 's “ Christmas Tree , ” which was written in the final weeks of their life . Merrill was dying of AIDS , although this information was n't made public until years after their death . The book includes many extraordinary poems about mortality , many of them self-portraits . Particularly moving is the final poem , “ An Upward Look , ” which describes the world as “ this vast facility the living come / dearest to die in ” — medicalizing , as it were , all existence . But , in a sense , the book 's capstone is the poem that did n't make it in . “ Christmas Tree ” is a “ shape poem , ” taking the form of the right half of a Christmas tree , narrowing at the end to a trunk . A dramatic monologue , it 's spoken by the tree a family has brought down “ from the cold sighing mountain ” to decorate the family home . The tree knows it must soon die . But nonetheless it speaks of being feted , finding that , “ honestly , / It did help to be wound in jewels , to send / Their colors flashing forth from vents in the deep / Fragrant sable that cloaked me head to foot . ”
The poem is remarkable , I think , for its combination of rich descriptive language and stark reflection on the slow fade of the body ; for its ability to convey both the painful vividness of life and the sorrowful muting of physical diminishment . Unlike Keats 's speaker in “ Ode to a Nightingale , ” musing on the immortal sublimity of the nightingale and the painless release of death , Merrill 's Christmas tree must reflect on its disembodiment :
Yes , yes , what lay ahead
Was clear : the stripping , the cold street , my
chemicals
Plowed back into Earth for lives to come —
No doubt a blessing , a harvest , but one that does n't
bear ,
Now or ever , dwelling upon . To have grown so thin .
Needles and bone . The little boy 's hands meeting
About my spine .
The shape of the poem powerfully intensifies the realization of death , and enacts it ( much as Hitchens 's scattered notes enact their death ) . At the end , the poem shifts to short lines and sentence fragments :
No dread . No bitterness . The end beginning . Today 's
Dusk room aglow
For the last time
With candlelight .
Faces love lit ,
Gifts underfoot .
Still to be so poised , so
Receptive . Still to recall , to praise .
You would think Treasury Secretary Jack Lew 's decision to replace Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill would have provoked a massive conservative backlash . But you would be underestimating the extent and speed of Conservatism Inc. 's transformation into Cuckservatism Inc.—submitting to , and even slobbering over , the very forces it is nominally pledged to resist .
Some individuals , notably Donald Trump , along with some of their high profile supporters and sympathizers like Pat Buchanan , Ben Carson , Greta Van Susteren , and Ann Coulter did indeed oppose Lew 's move .
However , when Donald Trump called the move “ pure political correctness , ” Red State 's Leon Wolf [ Email him ] said that it was “ evident that they are once again signaling to their white supremacist basis of support ” [ Trump 's Hypocrisy on Harriet Tubman “ Political Correctness ” Proves that they are Actively Courting Racists , April 21 , 2016 ]
And Republican consultant Liz Mair ( the woman responsible for ads featuring semi-nude photos of Melania Trump ) similarly tweeted that Trump 's opposition to Tubman was designed to court “ white nationalists . ”
So Trump 's upset about Harriet Tubman going on the $ 20 bill ? Wow . I did n't see that pander to white nationalists coming ... — Liz Mair ( @ LizMair ) April 21 , 2016
Reality check : If opposing Tubman on Political Correctness grounds makes you a “ white supremacist , ” then even the most tepid neoconservatives of 20 years ago were far more racist than Trump .
Trump , after all , still stipulated that Tubman was “ fantastic ” and suggested they might deserve a place on U.S. currency—just not at the expense of Jackson . But back in 1992 , when the National Endowment for Humanities created the National Standards for United States History , Lynne Cheney ( Dick 's wife and former chair of the National Endowment for Humanities ) objected that Tubman simply did not merit the attention they were getting :
Harriet Tubman , an African-American who helped rescue slaves by way of the Underground Railroad , is mentioned six times . Two white males who were contemporaries of Tubman , Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee , get one and zero mentions , respectively . Alexander Graham Bell , Thomas Edison , Albert Einstein , Jonas Salk and the Wright brothers make no appearance at all . [ The End of History , Wall Street Journal October 20 , 1994 ]
Stanley Rothman , Althea K. Nagai , and Robert Lerner wrote a critique of high school textbooks , Molding the Good Citizen , which leading neoconservatives like Nathan Glazer and Cheney endorsed enthusiastically . The authors criticized texts that they said were responsible for `` more students knowing about Harriet Tubman than George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , Joseph Stalin , or Winston Churchill . '' The pre-purge National Review summarized their critique by writing that textbooks were “ bowing to feminism and left-wing black politics by overstating the importance of such historical figures as Harriet Tubman. ” [ Battle of the Books , by Mark Gerson , August 14 , 1995 ] .
William J. Bennett similarly complained that “ something approaching 85 percent of the 17 year olds in America know who Harriet Tubman is , while only about one-third of our high school seniors can place the Civil War in the right half century ” [ The War Over Culture in Education , Heritage Foundation , September 5 , 1991 ] .
As Catherine Clinton observed in their 2004 biography , Harriet Tubman : The Road to Freedom , `` Tubman 's name became a hot button for conservative critics , and they became a symbolic 'whipping girl ' for political correctness . '' Similarly , in their 2007 book , Harriet Tubman : Myth , Memory , and History , Milton C. Sernett similarly noted that `` Tubman had become the iconic embodiment of African American history —'politically correct ' on two counts : race and gender . ''
If anything , Establishment conservatives should now be more skeptical of elevating Tubman than they were in the 1990s . Although they had by then become a major figure in high school textbooks and in dozens of children 's biographies based largely on the Communist Earl Conrad 's propagandistic exhumation of them in the 1930s , no historian had written a serious biography of them until the early 2000s [ The Moses Of Them People , by James M. McPherson , New York Review of Books , March 11 , 2004 , subscriber link . See also James Fulford 's Harriet Tubman—Gun-Toting Republican , Delusional Narcoleptic , And/Or Creation Of Communist Propaganda ? May 15 , 2015 ] . These biographies , including Clinton 's and Sennett 's cited above , found that many of Tubman 's already meager accomplishments had been exaggerated or even invented .
Instead , however , the vast majority of Conservatism Inc. commentators have chosen to celebrate this latest effort to make Tubman equal , if not superior , to the Founding Fathers and other white male heroes . Whereas Respectable Right commentators of just a couple decades ago complained about Tubman 's overemphasis in textbooks , Eli Lehrer [ Email him ] claims at National Review that the radical Tubman was more important than “ the description of them as an ‘ Underground Railroad conductor ' that appears in my son 's elementary-school materials and many popular accounts of their life . '' Lehrer concludes :
Harriet Tubman was a black , Republican , gun-toting , veterans ' activist , with ninja-like spy skills and strong Christian beliefs . They probably would n't have an ounce of patience for the obtuse posturing of some of the tenured radicals hanging around Ivy League faculty lounges . [ What They Did n't Teach You in School about Harriet Tubman , April 21 , 2016 ]
Where once for conservatives Tubman was “ a symbolic 'whipping girl ' for political correctness , ” National Review just ran a blog post Harriet Tubman Is a Great Choice , Not a Politically Correct One [ by Jim Geraghty , April 21 , 2016 ] . And National Review 's Charles Cooke tweeted “ What is ‘ politically correct ' about a gun-toting Christian revolutionary who helped John Brown and willfully defied federal law ? ”
Needless to say , National Review Editor Rich Lowry [ Email him ] is especially effusive about Tubman—sample quotes :
`` Literally a freedom fighter . ''
`` A biopic-worthy life of bravery and idealism ''
`` Tubman is inarguably an exemplary figure ''
`` The `` Moses '' of the Underground Railroad ''
`` A symbol of all the nameless persons held in bondage in early America ''
While the neoconservatives once complained that Tubman was elevated to be equal to the founders and great Americans of the Civil war , Cooke [ Email him ] now asserts on Twitter that Tubman was indeed as important : “ Harriet Tubman was a freedom fighter in just the way that the Founders were . Same North Star . Same ‘ promissory note . ' Even higher stakes . ”
Red State 's Leon Wolf even suggests that Tubman was as , or even more consequential , than Lincoln and Grant , in the fight to save the Union and abolish slavery .
There are so many figures who were central to our great Civil War , both in the military sense ( like Grant ) and the political sense ( like Lincoln ) . But the Civil War was , at bottom , a spiritual fight . It was won on the battlefields of Shiloh and Gettysburg , but these battles would never have been fought if not for the inspirational figures like Frederick Douglass , John Brown , and Harriet Tubman . [ Harriet Tubman is an Excellent Choice for the $ 20 Bill , Red State , April 20 , 2016 ]
It would take volumes to debunk all the myths about Tubman , but it 's worth noting that their new Conservatism Inc. fans particularly tout their fervent Christianity .
However , as James M. McPherson noted , Tubman suffered from a head injury which caused “ what their biographers variously term ‘ temporal lobe epilepsy ' or ‘ narcolepsy ' or possibly ‘ cataplexy . ' ” And as Kate Clifford Larson explains it in their biography of Tubman , Bound for the Promised Land : Harriet Tubman , Portrait of an American Hero , Tubman 's head injury `` coincided with an explosion of religious enthusiasm , '' driven by a `` lifetime of potent dreams and visions that , they claimed , foretold the future . ''
In any other historical figure , this apparent heterodoxy would generate as much unease as Mitt Romney 's Mormonism . Praising their strong Christianity as evidence of their conservatism is like calling the homeless man who claims they talk to God a member of the Religious Right . But Conservatism Inc. has no scruple : it needs to sway the rubes .
When Big Brother finally breaks Winston Smith in George Orwell 's 1984 , Smith does not acknowledge defeat . Instead , they describe their prior hatred of Big Brother as a “ cruel , needless misunderstanding ” . The novel ends : `` It was all right , everything was all right , the struggle was finished . They had won the victory over himself . They loved Big Brother . ''
This pathetic Conservatism Inc. embrace of Tubman is no different . Rather than fight for principles they professed to believe just a few years ago , they have “ won a victory ” over themselves . In defeat , they have elected to believe they are victorious .
If we had men like Rich Lowry instead of Andrew Jackson during the Seminole Wars or the War of 1812 , they 'd be pretending that the Scott Massacre or burning down the White House was their idea .

The NBA will suspend Rockets point guard Ty Lawson two games for a DUI arrest that happened earlier in the year , as first reported by Yahoo Sports ' Adrian Wojnarowski . The league is taking action now because the cases against Lawson have recently been resolved .
Lawson was arrested two separate times in 2015 for driving under the influence , first in January and then in July , when they were forced to enter a court-ordered rehabilitation program . They were a member of the Denver Nuggets then , but was traded to the Rockets , largely because of their off-court issues that go back to an underage drinking arrest when they were playing college ball for North Carolina .
Since arriving at Houston , there have n't been any reports of misconduct . However , the team and Lawson 's representatives have been working together on finding a destination to trade the 28-year-old point guard because they have fit in poorly on the court next to James Harden , according to Wojnarowski .
Lawson will miss the Rockets ' next two games against the Clippers and Hornets .
Lawson is averaging six points and four assists in 25 minutes a game this season .
Amanda Bynes ' parents have finally done something that they 've wanted to do for a while as they watch their daughter spin out of control : filed court documents asking a California judge to impose a conservatorship on them
It 's difficult to get a conservatorship in California , TMZ reports , but their parents are filing for the conservatorship because of Bynes ' apparent mental illness .
Medical professionals have said that Bynes is exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia . They asked to put a 2-week extension on the 5150 hold they were put under after they started a fire at the home of an elderly woman in Thousand Oaks . It 's not clear what aspects of Bynes ' life their parents would want authority over , TMZ says .
It could be similar to the conservatorship that Britney Spears was put under a a few years ago . Spears reportedly told Bynes that they are glad that their dad took the reigns in the middle of their arrests and breakdowns .
There will be a court hearing on the conservatorship on Friday .

The presidential transition hit a new low Wednesday , with President-elect Donald Trump openly criticizing President Obama for bungling U.S. relations with Israel and erecting other “ roadblocks ” to a smooth transfer of power in Washington .
With 24 days to go before Mr. Trump 's inauguration , the president-elect 's frustration with Mr. Obama 's perceived undermining of their victory , and wide-ranging efforts to tie the hands of the incoming administration , boiled over in a series of comments by Mr. Trump on Twitter .
“ Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks , ” Mr. Trump said . “ Thought it was going to be a smooth transition — NOT ! ”
The president has been rushing with executive actions to lock in policies that Mr. Trump is n't likely to support , such as bans on offshore drilling and a fresh round of pending sanctions against Russia for cyberattacks that the administration says were aimed at helping Mr. Trump win the election .
The expanded sanctions against Russia are expected to be announced Thursday , and Mr. Obama is promising to launch covert cyberoperations in retaliation .
Last week , the administration officially dismantled a dormant legal framework that Mr. Trump could have used for vetting Muslim visitors in the U.S .
Mr. Obama also riled Mr. Trump this week by claiming in an interview that they would have defeated the Republican in the November election , if only the pesky Constitution had let them run for a third term . Mr. Trump responded , “ NO WAY ! ”
But the move that most alarmed Mr. Trump , judging from their tweet storm , was the administration 's decision not to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution that condemned Israel for settlement activity in the West Bank .
“ We can not continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect , ” Mr. Trump said on Twitter . “ They used to have a great friend in the U.S. , but not anymore . ”
The move at the United Nations angered the Israeli government , which accused the Obama administration of orchestrating the vote .
The president-elect told Israel on Wednesday , as George W. Bush said in a different context , that help is on the way . “ The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal , and now this ( U.N. ) ! Stay strong Israel , January 20th is fast approaching ! ” Mr. Trump said .
Secretary of State John F. Kerry defended the administration 's actions at the U.N. in a lengthy speech Wednesday , saying “ no American administration has done more for Israel 's security than Barack Obama ‘ s . ”
It was an astonishing public airing of the disagreements between Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama , who has pledged to do everything possible to create a “ smooth and efficient ” transfer of power . Although the two men have spoken by phone many times since the election , their mutual praise and handshake during a cordial Oval Office meeting on Nov. 10 now seem distant .
White House press secretary Josh Earnest dismissed Mr. Trump 's comments , telling CNBC , “ We 've been ignoring these tweets for a year — why would we start responding now ? ”
Asked by reporters if their transition was proceeding smoothly , Mr. Trump said , “ I think very , very smoothly . Very good . You do n't think so ? ”
Speaking to reporters in Florida about U.S. jobs , the president-elect said they spoke with Mr. Obama earlier Wednesday and had “ a very nice conversation . ”
Mr. Trump has been irritating the White House in ways that go beyond their victory over the president 's chosen successor , Hillary Clinton . They have expressed eagerness to unravel some of Mr. Obama 's most cherished initiatives , including the Affordable Care Act , a global climate change agreement and a massive free trade deal in the Asia-Pacific region .
The president-elect also disturbed the White House with their call last week for the U.S. to “ greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. ” In response , Mr. Obama on Tuesday hailed the efforts of the U.S. and Japan at “ slowing the spread of nuclear weapons ” to keep the peace in Asia .
During the memorial event at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , Mr. Obama also seemed to take aim again at Mr. Trump 's foreign policy plans with one of those “ inflammatory ” statements .
“ Even when hatred burns hottest , the tug of tribalism is at its most primal , we must resist the urge to turn inward , ” Mr. Obama said . “ We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different . ”
Trump transition spokesperson Sean Spicer said Wednesday that the president-elect 's tweet about the less-than-smooth transition “ speaks for itself. ” But Mr. Spicer , the incoming White House press secretary , said Mr. Obama and their staff have been “ helpful and generous ” to the Trump team .
As if the transition has become a popularity contest , Obama supporters were gloating on social media Wednesday that the president beat Mr. Trump in a Gallup poll as the “ most admired ” man of 2016 . Of those surveyed , 22 percent chose Mr. Obama , while Mr. Trump came in second with 15 percent . Pope Francis was third .
Gallup said it was Mr. Obama 's ninth consecutive win , but the 7 percentage point margin was their narrowest victory yet .
In the 70 years that Gallup has asked the question , the incumbent president has won 58 times .
Mrs. Clinton was rated as the most admired woman , edging out first lady Michelle Obama .
Transition tensions also flared this week when Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez , who is running for the chairpersonship of the Democratic National Committee , accused the Trump team of breaking the law by sending questionnaires to government agencies such as the Energy Department seeking to identify employees who had worked on climate change .
“ Those questions have no place in a transition , ” Mr. Perez said . “ That is illegal . ”
The president-elect 's transition team responded that “ the transition has a memorandum of understanding in place with the administration , and we continue to uphold both of our ends in this agreement . ”

The University of Massachusetts plans to freeze its fees and tuition for in-state undergraduates next year , according to a vote taken by the UMass Board of Trustees finance committee on Wednesday .
The freeze means tuition and mandatory fees for UMass Amherst will remain at $ 13,258 . Counting room and board , the cost will be $ 24,215 .
The vote came after both branches of the state legislature voted to pay for 50 percent of the cost of education at UMass .
`` At a time when there is a national focus on controlling cost and curbing debt , the University of Massachusetts and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are doing something about it , '' UMass President Robert Caret said in a statement . `` We are serious about addressing what has become a critical issue for families across the state and throughout the nation . ''
The public university and the state reached an agreement two years ago to increase the state 's funding of UMass by $ 100 million over two years so that the state would pay half the cost of education at UMass 's five campuses . In exchange , UMass would freeze fees and tuition . The state reached the 50:50 goal for the first time last year , and UMass froze its fees and tuition .
This year , both the House and Senate have proposed allocating $ 519 million to support UMass , an amount that would again meet the 50:50 goal . Although the final state budget has not yet been passed , the UMass trustees relied on those figures and took the first step toward freezing fees and tuition again this year . The trustees ' finance committee voted unanimously to give preliminary approval to a freeze .
The final step in the rate setting process will happen June 18 when the Board of Trustees meets at UMass Dartmouth .
House Speaker Robert DeLeo , a Winthrop Democrat , said in a statement , `` I 'm proud we were able to provide the budgetary funding that enables UMass to take this important step towards freezing tuition for the second year in a row and I thank President Caret and the Trustees for their collaboration in reaching this lofty goal . ''
Tuition and fees vary for UMass 's other campuses . Not counting room and board , they will be $ 11,966 at UMass Boston ; $ 11,681 at UMass Dartmouth ; and $ 12,447 at UMass Lowell .
The state legislature does not have to approve a budget until July 1 . The UMass trustees gave Caret authority to raise fees by up to 3.5 percent if the budget ultimately does not provide the full funding that UMass expects .
The average American 's views of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have converged for the first time in Gallup 's yearlong tracking of the images of the two candidates , with Americans giving each exactly the same favorable and unfavorable ratings . The numbers for both candidates , based on interviewing conducted July 18-25 , are 37 % favorable and 58 % unfavorable . In all previous Gallup updates stretching back to last July , Clinton 's net favorable has been higher than Trump 's .
The current period covers the four days of the Republican convention , but also includes the weekend in which Clinton announced their vice presidential running mate and the first night of the Democratic convention . In fact , when the data from Saturday , Sunday and Monday are isolated , the numbers are even slightly more in Trump 's favor -- 37 % /58 % favorable/unfavorable , compared with Clinton 's 36 % /59 % . In other words , there is no evidence through Monday night that Trump is losing their image gains from their Cleveland convention .
Trump is also still getting more attention than Clinton . From Saturday through Monday , 72 % of Americans reported having read , seen or heard anything about Clinton `` in the last day or two , '' compared with 76 % who said the same about Trump . This slight edge for Trump occurred even as the convention focus began to shift away from the Republicans and toward the Democrats . The question asks about `` the last day or two , '' so it 's possible -- if not likely -- that Clinton will begin to edge out Trump on this measure as this week progresses . The impact the Democratic convention will have on their image remains to be seen . In fact , the convention 's impact on their image in general is one of the most important issues facing their campaign . The Democrats ' convention comes after the Republicans ' this year , which gives Clinton the chance to make an impression on the average American that can carry forward . Whether they are able to do that , as noted , is the critical question .
Trump 's image may be improving compared with Clinton 's , but historically speaking , Americans ' self-reports about the GOP convention 's impact are mediocre .
For example , Trump 's speech got the least positive reviews of any speech we have tested after the fact : 35 % of Americans interviewed last weekend said it was excellent or good . Of the nine previous speeches we have rated , the top one was Barack Obama 's in August 2008 , which 58 % of Americans rated as excellent or good . The lowest-rated speech other than Trump 's was Mitt Romney 's in 2012 , with 38 % excellent or good .
Among just those who reported that they watched `` a great deal '' of the GOP convention , Trump 's speech rating was much better : 58 % of this group rated Trump 's speech as excellent or good ( with only 1 % not having an opinion or saying they did n't watch the speech ) . Of those who watched very little or none of the convention , 19 % rated Trump 's speech as excellent or good , with 26 % saying they did n't watch or did n't have an opinion . But this same type of disparity has been evident in our previous reviews of reactions to acceptance speeches as well , and the key finding is that , putting it all together , Trump 's speech received lukewarm ratings , based on historical comparisons .
The self-reported net impact of the GOP convention was also negative . Overall , 51 % of Americans say the convention made them less likely to vote for Trump , while 36 % said it made them more likely to vote for him . This is the highest `` less likely to vote '' percentage for a candidate in the 15 times Gallup has asked this question after a convention . The previous `` less likely '' high was 38 % after both conventions in 2012 , and after the GOP conventions in 2004 and 2008 .
Of course , the data show that 73 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the convention made them more likely to vote for Trump , compared with 2 % of Democrats . In other words , reaction to the speech was basically a reinforcement of pre-existing attitudes .
My colleague Jeff Jones will be doing a more comprehensive analysis of these self-reports early next week , when we have comparable data from the Democratic convention .
At this point , we can say that although Americans ' views of the Cleveland convention were not at all positive after it ended , the underlying trend data show that over the last week or so , Trump has managed to reach a milestone in their campaign : Their image among Americans is now identical to that of their opponent .

Yes indeed ! We signed Weyes Blood ( ! ! ! ) aka Natalie Mering for the world , to release their label debut in 2018 . We 've been longtime fans of the Los Angeles-based musician/singer 's work , from their four releases for Mexican Summer , as well as their collaborations with the likes of Ariel Pink , Perfume Genius , and Drugdealer .
Weyes Blood 's most recent release is the universally acclaimed , Front Row Seat To Earth . Pitchfork gave the album “ Best New Music ” and said , “ …She crafts emotional epics that masquerade as psych-folk ballads , subtly symphonic songs that are informed by yesterday but live and breathe right now. ” The Fader raved , “ The exceptional voice of Natalie Mering never ceases to sweep us off our feet… ” And NPR Music offers this , “ She embraces composure as a response to their generation 's uneasiness with the ruination of the planet and fading promises of stability and prosperity . Rather than treating gentleness and grace as liabilities , they refract their kinship with the voices of '60s folksingers like Joan Baez and Mary Travers , '70s soft rockers like Karen Carpenter , and Celtic new-age stylists like Enya — particularly their dulcet timbres , cursive phrasing and willowy vibratos — through their own vision . ”
While we wait for the new album , Weyes Blood has just released a new 7 ” single via Mexican Summer [ link here ] . The single featuring covers of Soft Machine 's “ A Certain Kind ” and Fred Neil 's song “ Everybody 's Talkin ” . “ Everybody 's Talkin ' ” b/w “ A Certain Kind ” is a capsule of Mering 's care for those artists and songs that have influenced them but also a discovery of a different kind — the words and melodies become Mering 's and ours through their intimate interpretation and commitment to seeking culture 's fringes for deeper meaning .

About Weyes Blood :
Natalie Mering aka Weyes Blood has released three full-length albums , a couple EPs , and has collaborated with such acts as Ariel Pink , Drugdealer and Perfume Genius . Mering 's entire output thus far has been an exercise in exploring the atemporal . They are a musician and a singer , after all , but the particular process of Weyes Blood 's development and Mering 's experimentation , with everything from their early days of local-noise-scene strangeness , to their present mastery of timeless balladry highlight them as a meticulous sonic alchemist .
The Innocents , Weyes Blood 's Mexican Summer debut , deepened and broadened the shimmering murkiness of their earlier album , The Outside Room , by shaving away the fuzzy lo-fi production to reveal a classic and singular songwriting ability .
Cardamom Times , the EP that followed , went further down the folky , lyrically evocative path that The Innocents traveled . The influence of classical music can be felt throughout these two works , rivaling the folk music lineage one may like to situate Mering 's songs .
Weyes Blood 's most recent album , the critically acclaimed Front Row Seat To Earth , captivates immediately with its frank clarity in both sound and word . Still retaining the deep influence of the classical while also blending in noise experimentations , Mering is at their most intimate and vulnerable here , due in large part to their stunning vocals and simple , essential lyrical phrasing .
Weyes Blood is currently touring and working on their Sub Pop debut which will be released in 2018 .

What “ The People ” have said about Weyes Blood and Front Row Seat to Earth :
What people have said about Weyes Blood and Front Row Seat to Earth :
“ Weyes Blood captures a particular sort of generational anxiety and mystery on their fourth album , a softly orchestrated work of pensive , symphonic folk. ” - Los Angeles Times
“ Singer to watch ” - Esquire
“ …'60s-leaning throwback bursting with cinematic harmonies , a lysergic , dream-like melody , and vocals that sound like they were dug up from '70s-era Laurel Canyon and Downey , when the likes of Joni Mitchell and the Carpenters roamed… ” - Elle
* * * * * - The Guardian
“ Mering envelopes hearts with their mournful , full-throated bellow , which would have been just as at home in the folk-heavy '70s as it is in 2016. ” - Newsweek
At a time when even titans like the Who 's Roger Daltrey have declared that rock “ has reached a dead end , ” The Pretty Reckless 's Taylor Momsen still speaks about the genre with evangelical zeal : “ Rock 'n ' roll represents freedom , ” they say on the phone from Florida before a show in Orlando later that night . “ It has no limits . It has no boundaries. ” And it 's true that few obstacles have impeded Momsen 's group . By one measure , The Pretty Reckless are the most successful rock band working : When their latest single , “ Take Me Down , ” topped the Mainstream Rock Chart recently , it marked their fourth No . 1 in four tries , something none of their competitors on that chart had ever accomplished .
Momsen , previously known for their roles in The Grinch and Gossip Girl , emerged as the lacerating lead singer of The Pretty Reckless in 2010 . The band 's second full-length , Going to Hell , settled on a winning , if not necessarily original , combination , mingling reverence for the rock canon with the shattering force of bar jukebox jock jams . As a singer , Momsen did more than just acknowledge the grim present—she welcomed it with open arms . “ Heaven Knows , ” The Pretty Reckless 's first No . 1 in the U.S. , includes group shouts of , “ we belong way down below. ” Pointing out this nasty , inevitable fate opened the door for resistance : “ Big man tells you where to go/ Tell 'em it 's good , tell 'em okay/ Do n't do a goddamn thing they say . ”
The band 's new album , Who You 're Selling For , opens in a similar state of a bleak enlightenment—the track , “ The Walls Are Closing In/Hangman , ” says a lot—but by the time Momsen gets to “ Take Me Down , ” two songs later , it becomes clear that the first track was a feint , and The Pretty Reckless 's primary interest this time around is in burnishing the classic side of their sound . The single contains a melange of blues references popular in rock between 1968 and 1975 , along with notable melodic and percussive nods to the Rolling Stones 's “ Sympathy for the Devil. ” After that , the references start to gush . “ Wild City ” comes on like a hard-rock update of Isaac Hayes 's “ Theme from Shaft , ” all trembling guitar and ticking cymbals , while the opening line— “ It 's that time of the season , when the blood runs hot ” —adapts the beginning of the Zombie 's 1968 hit “ Time of the Season. ” Another tune , “ Mad Love , ” was penned as a tribute to David Bowie . “ I wrote that right after Bowie passed , ” Momsen recalls . “ I was very very devastated by that . ”
Who You 're Selling For is not a half-hearted homage : While The Pretty Reckless worked with Kato Khandwala , who has produced every one of their albums , they also brought in outside musicians with a very specific pedigree . The easygoing “ Back to the River ” features slide-guitar playing from Warren Haynes , known for their longtime tenure in the Allman Brothers Band , and three backup singers appear on a pair of tracks to conjure the fuller sound of past decades of rock . That trio includes Janice Pendarvis , who has contributed to records by Sting and Bowie , and who also appeared in the Oscar-winning documentary , 20 Feet From Stardom .
“ For the first time we brought in live musicians so we could get that live feel instead of having to overdub a keyboard later , ” Momsen explains . “ It took songs to a whole new place . A good example is ‘ The Devil 's Back . ' That was originally going to be two minutes . But we were all playing together live , and it felt good . We just kept playing , and now it 's one of the longest songs on the record . ”
“ Today everything is done in the box , in the computer , ” they add , echoing a complaint that 's hurtled through the rock world for decades . “ Everything 's manipulated , everything 's lined up so it 's literally perfect , ” they continue . “ I think you lose the human element . The reason the classic records sound so great is that they did n't have the ability to fix everything , overdubs , autotune , any of that shit . ”
The success of “ Take Me Down ” seems to vindicate this old-school approach . “ It 's fucking crazy , ” Momsen says . “ That 's four No . 1s . But they confess to having “ no idea ” why The Pretty Reckless 's songs resonate . “ I can say it 's the most rewarding feeling in the world when you finish a good song and you can play it all the way through and go , ‘ check this out . ' There 's no greater feeling . Then you fall back down the rabbit hole— ‘ Fuck , I have to do this again . ' We do n't feel outside pressure . We put the pressure on ourselves . ”
But in the messy world of rock 'n ' roll , where mistakes take on a beauty of their own , Momsen has a safety net—she does n't have to get every part of a song right , adding : “ Imperfection [ can ] be the thing that makes it perfect . ”
The new Netflix series Stranger Things is a pitch-perfect love-letter to 1980s pop culture and especially the nascent sub-culture surrounding Dungeons & Dragons . Seamlessly melding John Carpenter soundtracks , Stephen King small towns , and Spielbergian wonder with a dramatic and satisfying plot , Stranger Things is quite simply , amazing .
In the first episode we are introduced to four middle-school aged friends who are deep into a rousing game of Dungeons & Dragons . Mike , the dungeon-master , is building up to the party 's next encounter . After a sly bit of mis-direction they hammer this miniature onto the table .

And it gave me a chill when I saw it .
One of John Dennett 's classic Fantasy Lords miniatures sculpted for Grenadier Miniatures and a model that I once owned along with several of John 's other creations . To have such a complete nostalgia loop hit me so early in the show created a connection that I 'm still sort of buzzing over . And far from being merely a nod or name-check , the `` Demogorgon '' as its known in the kid 's game , remains relevant for the entire show .
So I reached out to John Dennett to learn a bit more about this suddenly remembered classic mini . As always John has been very gracious and helpful when it comes to their fans .
The Demogorgon is now being produced by Mirliton Miniatures in Italy .
NEWS ! ! ! John Dennett is working on a new DEMOGORGON ! Check it out here :

+++++++
RB : How long had you been sculpting for Grenadier when you sculpted the “ Demogorgon ” ?
JD : I began working as a free-lance sculptor for Grenadier Models in 1982 and after a few months was offered a full time position at the company sometime in the early Autumn as I recall . The Demogorgon was sculpted in 1984 and released within weeks of my completing it . That was pretty much the way things moved at the company , soon as the sculpture was finished it went to the mold maker and usually within a day or two was spun for initial casting .
RB : Was the miniature sculpted to represent the Demogorgon from Dungeons and Dragons
or meant as more of a generic demon ?
Demogorgon with the original Monster Manual artwork . Picture by Alex Bates .
JD : At the time I came on board full time at Grenadier , they had ceased their association with TSR on the licensed AD & D figure line . First thing they wanted to do was to phase out the AD & D figure sets and replace them with similar counterparts . We received input from the fans and elsewhere as to which characters were most popular across the RPG environment and usually worked those suggestions into our lines . Demogorgon was one of those . My job was to design a character that could be used as the desired one but keep it different enough to stand on it 's own for our purpose of not copying what had gone before . I redesigned the Demogorgon to more of a unique monster in keeping with my stye of art . As I recall I added a second pair of tendrils , extra eyes , crests to the tops of the heads etc . I would have made it larger in scale but there were always restrictions with fitting into our packaging and this needed to seat within the confines of a bister pack .
RB : Any thoughts on the other little demon included in the set ?
JD : If you 're referring to the little impish creature , that was one of my original designs that was actually released in a few different ways . One had wings , one did not and there was a third with varied features . I do n't remember which one ended up in the blister though .
RB : What materials was the original sculpted in and how long did it take ?
JD : All my originals were sculpted using Atlas Epoxy-Bond epoxy putty as the medium . This was favored for a good many reasons but was durable enough once cured to withstand the Vulcanizing process of high-temperature and pressure in preparing the master molds .
The exact amount of time to create the sculpture was probably 3 working 8 hour days or so . The only things that took longer were the standard dragons , some giants and my War-Bots
RB : All of your minis push the limits of what can be cast in a two part mold , especially in the 1980s . How much did you learn about casting miniatures before starting to sculpt them ?
JD : I was always trying to figure out how things worked and prior to my time at Grenadier I collected toys and models and studied parting-lines and part breakdown . Marx play-set figures were approx . 54mm and the parting lines were prominent . On their larger 6 '' hard plastic figures it became easier to understand why parting lines were established where they were and how things like surface details became less prominent approaching them . The Marx `` Nutty-Mads '' series of figures were great educators for me even before getting into the business of designing figures for production .
A Marx Toys `` Nutty-Mad '' . From Wikipedia .
Once I was at Grenadier I worked closely with Rich Jennings who was the head of the mold making and casting departments to establish what I could `` get away with '' with the design and animation of my sculptures .
As I already mentioned , there were several restrictions , mostly packaging related , that limited my ability to create more dynamic sculptures . That and the rule to keep the sculptures as 'one-piece ' as possible . That was always tricky ! I hated the look of flattened figures that almost patterned the look of Egyptian tomb paintings , even though that was the easiest way to mold them ... press the prototype in the the uncured rubber and have minimal build-up to establish parting lines . So I always pushed for more animation where ever I could in my designs .
Rich , to my delight , embraced the chance to to more complex molds and readily accepted all that I presented to him . The size and thickness of my sculptures were always a bone of contention to me . I knew they would be much more impressive if I was allowed to go larger and with additional parts . Ultimately this was one of the reasons I decided to part company with Grenadier in 1986 . I felt I had done all I could in 25mm miniatures under those limitations and was anxious to move on and pursue other things artistically .
One of Dennett 's more recent gaming miniature sculpts , a Histath for Forge of Ice . Painted by Andrew Taylor of Antediluvian Miniatures . RB : Have you been watching Stranger Things ?
JD : Not as of yet , but I plan to as soon as I get a little free time . I 've read nothing but shining reviews on the series so I 'm looking forward to binge-watching all episodes once I have the chance .
RB : If you could go back in time to when you sculpted this and say :
” Hey John , this miniature is going to be a really big deal in a very popular series in the year 2016. ” , what would your response have been ?
JD : Probably my response would have been ; `` Hope I live long enough to see that happen ! ''
If I could go back in time and know what I do now , I 'd be getting royalties on every thing I created back then for as you know , 32 years later many of my creations are still being produced and sold throughout the world . But really , who knew ? I of course am flattered my work has held up through the decades and is still in demand today ... maybe more than when first released .

RB : Do you have any interest in sculpting for film and television ?
JD : Yes I do and have for a long time . It has n't happened as of yet but I wo n't fight the opportunity if it should manifest . That would be a total blast for me to achieve some screen credit for my artwork after a lifetime of creative design .
RB : What are you currently working on at Moondevil Studio ?
The Life Leecher from Moondevil Studio . JD : I 'm constantly creating new sculptures in a wide range of scales targeted at the hobby modeler . These resin model kits are designed , sculpted , molded and cast by me as not only a source of income but a chance to express myself in sculptural form in ways I had been planning to do all during the years I was working commercially . Commercial work , though it pays the bills , is n't the ideal environment for one who relishes in doing creative design as the majority of the subjects handled commercially are licensed properties with very little or no opportunities to expound on beyond the established style guides . That is why I created Moondevil Studio , to indulge in sculpting my favorite things and offering them to a limited degree to an audience that particularly enjoys my work ... even if its a completely unique concept .
At the present time I 'm offering my `` Imaginary Fiends '' line of miniature busts , 1/2 scale busts of Classic Movie Monsters , `` Crypto Legends '' figures based on mysterious animals not yet proven to exist , and lots more . New pieces are offered almost on a monthly basis so I keep busy with this in addition to taking on commissions from time to time .

TWH – We 've long known that Pagan and polytheist revival and reconstruction movements are a global phenomenon , and that has included , quietly , tentatively , the Middle East . While most countries in the Middle East are culturally , religiously , and demographically dominated by Islam , that has n't stopped a few adventurous souls from embracing various forms of modern Pagan religions . This is n't safe , and in some cases it has led to deadly tragedy , but this thread persists , alongside the sorts of syncretic esotericism that have always existed on the margins of the dominant monotheisms . A recent article in Arab Times , notes that in Kuwait people are buying statues of pre-Islamic gods , much to the outrage of some local officials .
“ MP Abdulrahman Al-Jeeran has recommended banning the sale of statues of the gods followed by idol-worshippers during the pre-Islamic times of paganism , indicating that they had discovered the sale of statues as works of art and gift items by some shops , reports Al-Rai daily . They revealed that statues representing gods believed by non-Muslim pagan worshippers during the primitive era are commonly seen at various shopping malls across the country . They added that the retailer sells these items under the pretext of selling accessories and fashion materials without considering the real meaning behind those artifacts . ”
There 's been a school of thought which posits that polytheism is humanity 's default religious setting , which is why religions like Christianity and Islam must constantly be in a process of conversion , re-conversion , and solidifying power to maintain the massive numbers they currently enjoy across the globe . If they do n't , or if they are limited by secular governments , the “ old ” beliefs start to re-emerge . As scholar Jordan Paper put it in their book , The Deities Are Many : A Polytheistic Theology , quote :
“ Given the history of Homo sapiens , it may be that polytheism is inherent in human nature , not so much in the sense that is part of our DNA structure but that it arises from the human experience in conjunction with our nature . For unless we accept the arguments of the ur-monotheists that is contrary to the above , monotheism is extremely recent , given the sweep of human history ; arose in a tiny part of the planet ; and is constantly breaking down . ”
Of course , that “ tiny part of the planet ” happens to be the Middle East , and there are immense vested interests within all the monotheisms to ensure that the birthplace of their theology remains solidly in the hands of those who believe in the God of Abraham ( though they also struggle amongst themselves for dominance ) . But , if religious freedoms were really guaranteed , could polytheism , Paganism , truly emerge in the Middle East ? Right now , Egypt , which has been rocked by revolution , coup , internal fighting , and unrest this year , is currently trying to write a new constitution for their country that will be accepted by both Islamic hardliners , the military , non-Muslim religious groups ( like the Copts ) , and a large secular-minded minority . A key point of contention is what form religious freedom will take in this new constitution , and by extension , this new government .
“ One significant change , says committee head Amr Moussa , is that Article 3 which guarantees Christians and Jews the right to exercise their religious rites will probably be extended to include all non-Muslims . Article 3 currently states that ‘ For Egyptian Christians and Jews the principles of their religious law will be the main source in regulating their personal status , matters pertaining to their religion , and the selection of their spiritual leadership . ' The amended version is expected to state that ‘ for all Egyptian non-Muslims the principles of their religious laws will be the main source in regulating their personal status…etc ' . The proposed change is opposed by Mohamed Ibrahim Mansour , the newly-appointed representative of the ultraconservative Nour Party . In a closed meeting on Monday Mansour issued the melodramatic warning that the term ‘ non-Muslims ' would open gates to ‘ religious sects like worshippers of the devil'. “
Expanding religious freedoms beyond the “ People of the Book ” is increasingly seen as necessary by religious minorities and secular Egyptians , first , because faiths like Baha ' i “ can not legally marry and continue to have trouble with matters such as inheritance because the law does not properly recognize their presence. ” In addition , there is a growing number Egyptians who are n't simply secular , but have embraced atheism , despite the grave social disadvantages inherent in that choice .
“ ‘ Atheists are all around Egypt , ' said Othman Othman , pointing to a group of young people sitting at the table next to us . The number of atheists in Egypt is not less than three million , Othman claimed , but they do not label themselves ‘ atheists ' as society would disown them . Those who have come out publicly as atheists have been not only isolated by their friends and families , but also society in general . However , others who turn down their familial religion have faced many worse trials than mere isolation . Asmaa Omar , 24 , who has just graduated the Faculty of Engineering , said that once they revealed their beliefs to their family , they began to physically and mentally torture them Them father slapped them in the face and broke their jaw . They were not able to eat properly for seven months . ”
Once you open the door to Baha ' i and atheists , it is only a matter of time before we see a Kemetic/Egyptian polytheist revival ( or even Egyptian Wiccans ) . After all , Egypt is already a global hotspot for seekers , New Agers , and yes , Pagans , wanting to see the many ancient treasures and wonders of the country . Once the chaos abates , Egypt will want the massive tourism revenue to return , and with it will come the exchange of ideas that results from a flood of visitors . In fact , we know that there are already Pagans in Egypt , but a more open society might spark unexpected growth .
The question remains : can Paganism emerge in the Middle East ? Will it be allowed to ? If secular governments ( or at least pseudo-secular hybrids ) start to emerge , it could happen , and if/when it does , what happens next ?
Doctors Without Borders says it is under `` the clear presumption that a war crime has been committed '' after a U.S.-led NATO coalition bombed its hospital in Kunduz , Afghanistan .
The aid organization , referred to internationally in French as Medecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) , asserted that it `` condemn [ s ] this attack , which constitutes a grave violation of International Humanitarian Law . ''

The U.S. military 's version of the story behind the bombing is full of holes , and constantly changing . After launching airstrikes on Kunduz , which has recently seen an insurgency by the Taliban , on Saturday morning , NATO said its bombing `` may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility . ''
At least 22 people people were killed in the airstrikes , including 12 staff members and 10 patients , three of whom were children . A minimum of 37 more were wounded . A hospital nurse said there `` are no words for how terrible it was , '' noting `` patients were burning in their beds . ''
Uncertainty dominated Washington 's earliest account of the attack . The media echoed this ambiguity , but MSF insisted all `` indications currently point to the bombing being carried out by international Coalition forces '' led by the U.S . The humanitarian organization stressed that it had `` communicated the precise locations of its facilities to all parties on multiple occasions over the past months '' and yet , despite this , the NATO bombing of the hospital continued for over 30 minutes , even after MSF `` frantically phoned '' Washington .
Subsequently , the U.S. and Afghan governments moved away from describing the attack as an accident , a tragic instance of `` collateral damage , '' and proceeded to imply the bombing was intentional . Afghan officials claimed the hospital was being used as a `` base '' for the Taliban . `` The hospital has a vast garden , and the Taliban were there , '' insisted Kunduz acting Governor Hamdullah Danishi .
MSF was not buying it . The aid organization called the `` Taliban base '' claims `` spurious '' and said it is `` disgusted by the recent statements coming from some Afghanistan government authorities justifying the attack . ''
The organization flatly denied that the Taliban was ever fighting from its hospital . `` Not a single member of our staff reported any fighting inside the MSF hospital compound prior to the U.S. airstrike , '' MSF recalled .
Advertisement :
`` These statements imply that Afghan and US forces working together decided to raze to the ground a fully functioning hospital with more than 180 staff and patients inside because they claim that members of the Taliban were present , '' MSF stated . `` This amounts to an admission of a war crime . This utterly contradicts the initial attempts of the US government to minimize the attack as 'collateral damage . ' ''
On Monday morning , the U.S. officially confirmed that it carried out the airstrikes on the hospital . Yet its story has changed once again . Now the U.S. says the Afghan military asked it for air support . Gen. John Campbell , commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan , told reporters NATO airstrikes , requested by Afghan forces , `` were called to eliminate the Taliban threat , and several innocent civilians were accidentally struck . ''
Twenty-three clearly constitutes more than `` several , '' but this is not the primary problem with Gen. Campbell 's claim . The three accounts of the incident promulgated by U.S. military can not all be true ; they contradict each other . MSF expressed frustration with the mercurial U.S. position . The government 's `` description of the attack keeps changing , '' MSF remarked , and Washington is `` now attempting to pass responsibility to the Afghanistan government . ''
`` The reality is the US dropped those bombs . The US hit a huge hospital full of wounded patients and MSF staff , '' the humanitarian organization added . `` The US military remains responsible for the targets it hits , even though it is part of a coalition . There can be no justification for this horrible attack . ''

Other international organizations have condemned the U.S. for the attack . U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein stated that , if `` established as deliberate in a court of law , an airstrike on a hospital may amount to a war crime . ''
`` This event is utterly tragic , inexcusable , and possibly even criminal , '' the U.N. chief added . They called for an independent and transparent inquiry into the bombing .
Like the U.N. , MSF is also requesting that `` an independent international body '' conduct an investigation into the attack on its hospital . The organization maintained that the U.S. investigating its own bombing `` would be wholly insufficient . ''

Just days before the bombing , MSF said it was `` overwhelmed with wounded patients '' amid heavy fighting between the Taliban and the Afghan government . In just two days , it had treated 252 people , including 53 children . The aid group noted its medical teams were `` working nonstop to provide the best possible care . ''
The Kunduz hospital was the only medical `` facility of its kind in the whole northeastern region of Afghanistan , providing free life- and limb-saving trauma care , '' MSF emphasized . The closest large hospital is hours away . Now , Doctors Without Borders , after losing a dozen staff members , is withdrawing from Afghanistan , leaving behind a city full of besieged civilians who will no longer have access to desperately needed medical care .
Philippe Gilbert may not be lining up at Strade Bianche this weekend but the BMC man spent time in Italy earlier this week to reconnoitre a pair of stages in the Giro d'Italia 's testing opening days in Liguria . Related Articles Giro d'Italia 2015 route unveiled

Gilbert is set to return to the Giro this May for the first time since 2009 , when they claimed victory on the short hilltop finish on the penultimate stage in Anagni on the penultimate day . This time around , their focus is on the first week , where they will target an early spell in the pink jersey of race leader .
After riding at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne at the weekend , Gilbert travelled to Italy to reconnoitre stage 3 from Rapallo to Sestri Levante and stage 4 from Chiavari to La Spezia in the company of Damiano Caruso and directeur sportif Fabio Baldato .
`` Those stages after the team time trial and the first flat road stage are n't the easiest and they want to take the pink jersey , '' BMC directeur sportif Valerio Piva told Het Laatste Nieuws .
`` The fact that the Monday after Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne they travelled immediately to Italy shows that they are really keen to do the Giro . Those two tough training days also fit perfectly with their schedule before Paris-Nice . ''
Stage 3 travels inland from Rapallo to tackle some rugged terrain including the Colle Caprile and Barbagelata before dropping back to the finish line in Sestri Levante . There is scarcely a metre of flat on the following day 's sinuous route to La Spezia , which features the climb of Biassa in the finale .
Gilbert will race Paris-Nice next week before lining up at Milan-San Remo on March 22 . They will forgo the cobbled classics and instead ride the Tour of the Basque Country to build form ahead of Amstel Gold Race , Flèche Wallonne and Liège-Bastogne-Liège .
While Gilbert will hope their post-Ardennes Classics form can lead to an early maglia rosa , BMC 's new arrival Caruso , meanwhile , will lead the team 's general classification challenge . The Sicilian finished 9th overall in last year 's Vuelta a España and 19th in the 2013 Giro .
Matthew Macklin admits their career is on the line against Jorge Sebastian Heiland
Matthew Macklin : Fights in Ireland for the first time since 2009
Matthew Macklin admits their career is on the line when they face Jorge Sebastian Heiland in Dublin on Saturday night .
Macklin meets the Argentine middleweight in a WBC world title eliminator at the 3Arena , and the 32-year-old says the stakes could not be higher ahead of their first fight in Ireland since December 2009 .
“ It 's the fight I need at this stage and if I can not beat him , then that 's it really , ” said Macklin .
“ I know I will beat them and it will set me up for a big 2015 where a world title shot will definitely come about .
“ He knows that beating me is a massive scalp and it throws them into the limelight and he 'll probably get a world title shot .
“ At this stage of my career having won the European title , Irish Title , British title , boxed in Las Vegas and Madison Square Garden and in world title fights , I would n't be putting in what I am putting in and making the sacrifices I am making if I did n't think I could become a world champion .
“ Golovkin is the best middleweight in the world , but I am confident I could beat any of the other fighters in the division , but I have to get past Heiland who is a serious fighter . He 's never been stopped and a couple of losses they have had , they have gone on to avenge them . ”
Observer
If Macklin sees off Heiland , he 'll be a keen observer as fellow countryman Andy Lee takes on Matt Korobov for the vacant WBO title in Las Vegas on December 13 .
Macklin rates Lee 's chances against the Russian and hopes that a pair of wins for the Irish duo could lead to a huge domestic clash , while they also still has their eyes on St Helens ' Martin Murray .
“ Andy has a good chance against Matt , ” said Macklin . “ Matt is a counterpunching southpaw and quite technical , Andy is a technical boxer too and I think Matt will give Andy time and I think he 's a class act when they have time .
I know I will beat them and it will set me up for a big 2015 where a world title shot will definitely come about . Matthew Macklin
“ It 's not out of the question that Andy can win the fight and them having a world title would be that extra ingredient for a fight between us , which would be a massive fight anyway .
“ I 'll be rooting for Andy for selfish reasons but also for them too as he 's flying the flag for Irish boxing and he 's a good lad too .
“ There 's a bit of needle between Martin and I and it 's a fight that has been talked about for a while . We 've both boxed Sturm and Martinez . He 's proven , well respected and rightly so , as am I .
“ I think beating Heiland would put me at number two in the WBC , Martin is number one but he 's got Golovkin next . So down the line , it 's very likely they would sanction a final eliminator .
“ A world title on the line would be great for that fight but a final eliminator is the next best thing , especially as Cotto is such a marquee name . I am up for the Murray fight , they are and Sky Sports would love it , so I think it 's a fight that makes a lot of sense for everyone involved .
“ My career does n't revolve around Andy Lee or Martin Murray though . I have to take the biggest and best fight out there for me , as will they .
“ To be world champion is my ultimate goal , if it means fighting them to get there then so be it . ”

Sue Bell Cobb was reveling in the mass celebration at Doug Jones 's victory party when a New York Times reporter approached them for a comment about the unlikely win .
`` Never has there been this level of civic engagement ... never has it happened , '' they were quoted as saying .
She 's hoping for another never-has-it-happened in 2018 .
Cobb , the former Alabama State Supreme Court chief justice - the first woman to hold that position from 2006-2011 , before Roy Moore reclaimed it in 2012 - is positioning themselves for a showdown against Republican Kay Ivey for governor .
It would be an all-female gubernatorial showdown to rivet the nation 's attention .
First things first , of course : Cobb will have to beat Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox in the June 5 Democratic primary . Other Democrats are also likely to run , including Jason Childs , James Fields and Anthony White . Candidates have until Feb. 9 to qualify as a Republican or Democrat to participate in the June 5 , 2018 , primaries .
`` I have people day in and day out who tell me how exciting it would be to have for Alabama to be seen as the state where two women are vying for the governor 's seat , '' said Cobb , 61 . `` That 's never happened and my prediction is that is what it will exactly be . ''
'Right time '
In Alabama 's nearly 200 years of statehood , only two women have been governor : Ivey , who was appointed to fill the position in April following Robert Bentley 's resignation , and Lurleen Wallace , who served a little more than a year from 1967-68 . Neither were opposed by another woman .
The potential of a Cobb/Ivey clash would come with the # MeToo movement serving as a political backdrop , perhaps a boost to the Democrats ' hopes of claiming the governor 's seat for the first time since 2003 .
Ivey has been a focus of criticism for their endorsement of Moore ahead of the Dec. 12 special Senate election . Them endorsement came with acknowledgment that they believed the women who 'd claimed that Moore had sexually targeted them when they were a fast-rising Gadsden lawyer in their 30s .
'Shame on you ' : Gov . Kay Ivey faces criticism on Roy Moore support , but will they benefit politically ? Alabama Gov . Kay Ivey has been the subject of an onslaught of social media criticism since they publicly said Friday they will vote for Republican Roy Moore in the Dec. 12 general election for U.S. Senate . Some political observers believe that Ivey 's comments could add a political boost for their gubernatorial campaign next year .
Moore has denied any wrongdoing , but the accusations affected their campaign and assisted in the Democrats ' first statewide win in Alabama in a decade .
`` The fact that Governor Ivey did what they did and the fact they came forward as they did and said , ' I believe them but I 'm still voting for them purely because of party , ' that is going to hurt her , '' Cobb said . `` My campaign has been that it 's time to have a governor who cares about the people than the party . ''
Cobb is promoting children and family issues on their campaign 's website , and they have the support of woman 's rights advocates like Lilly Ledbetter . Cobb co-authored a book , released in the fall , about childhood neglect and fully embraces the # MeToo movement . `` We are on the tip of the iceberg , '' they said .
For Cobb , it could be a matter of being in the right place at the right moment .
That 's certainly the thought of Jess Brown , a retired political science professor at Athens State University who 's seen campaigns rise and fall in Alabama for decades . Ivey 's endorsement of Moore is n't a liability , Brown said , unless they `` gets into a general election in 2018 and their opponent is Sue Bell Cobb or another female candidate '' who could appeal to suburban Republican women .
Richard Fording , a political science professor at the University of Alabama , agreed . `` Even though it has been a long time since they last won a statewide election and the political environment has changed , they may be running at the right time . '' They said , `` The # MeToo movement will certainly be a factor in 2018 and Kay Ivey will have to defend their support for Roy Moore . ''
In the Senate election , women were supportive of Jones by a nearly 16 percent margin , according to exit polling .
Black women backed Jones with an overwhelming 98 percent support . Jones got 34 percent support from white women , which was 8 percentage points better than what they got from white men , exit polling shows .
Suburban women are expected to be a political force in the 2018 midterms elsewhere in the U.S. , as are voters under age 40 . More than 60 percent of the youth vote backed Jones during the Dec. 12 election .
How did Doug Jones win ? Women and millennials pushed senator-elect to victory over Roy Moore Jones was buoyed by support from women , particularly black women , and young voters to become the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in a quarter century .
Beth Clayton , national committeewoman with the Young Democrats of Alabama , said a potential Ivey-Cobb showdown could be impactful in Alabama .
`` I think the fact that it 's possible to have two women at the top of the ticket going head-to-head means a lot for what little girls may see , '' said Clayton , a Birmingham resident , emphasizing that the Young Democrats do not endorse candidates during the primaries .
Early underdog
For Cobb to reach their dream showdown requires notching a win in the primary election .
William Stewart , a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Alabama , said they view Maddox as an early favorite to win the Democratic nomination . They said they believe `` many Alabamians , especially men , do n't wish to be put in the position of having a woman governor , no matter how they vote . ''
Fording is n't so sure . They believe Maddox , while popular in Tuscaloosa , does n't have the statewide name recognition Cobb attained during their time on the state Supreme Court .
Why Walt Maddox thinks they can win the Alabama governor 's race as a Democrat `` People have had enough dishonesty in Alabama politics , '' they say .
Cobb has raised $ 265,939 for their campaign since they announced their gubernatorial run in June , while Maddox has raised around $ 182,000 . Maddox , though , is coming off a strong November in which their campaign collected $ 107,057 to Cobb 's $ 45,749 .
For their part , Maddox is n't criticizing their Democratic opponent . `` I have faith that the women of Alabama will cast their votes for the candidate they believe will best serve the needs of this state , themselves and their families , '' they said .
Maddox said that the Senate election `` demonstrated that Alabamians can look beyond left versus right to affirm right over wrong . ''
No matter who wins out on the Democratic side , the fight will be uphill battle from there . Alabama has n't had a Democrat governor since 2003 .
Despite Jones 's win , Alabama is still considered a Republican stronghold . The state does n't register voters by political party , but a 2014 analysis by the Pew Research Center showed that 52 percent of residents identify as Republican and only 35 percent as Democrats . Only three other states have a higher percentage of Republicans , according to Pew .
The Republican gubernatorial hopefuls have also raised considerably more money than the two Democrats . Ivey leads the bunch , having pulled in more than $ 2 million .
Other Republicans are also far outdistancing the Democrats : Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle has raised $ 1.4 million , State Sen. Bill Hightower of Mobile is at $ 646,812 , and Birmingham youth pastor Scott Dawson has generated $ 455,062 .
For now , Ivey is n't talking about the governor 's race . Brent Buchanan , who is an advisor to Ivey 's campaign , said the governor is focused on the upcoming legislative session that begins in early January .
Cal Jillson , a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas who lasered in on Alabama politics during the Senate race , said they believe Ivey is the `` comfortable favorite , '' and does n't think the governor should be concerned about their position on Moore .
`` Governor Ivey was trying them very best to have it both ways and to reassure Republican primary voters they were sticking with the Republican candidate but reflecting with those suburban moderates that they understood what they were thinking , '' Jillson said . `` She was trying to straddle that divide and alienate as few people as possible . ''
They said , `` She will enjoy the normal Republican margin in Alabama . ''
Lifetime lottery
Cobb wants to start talking issues . They said they plan to roll out a plan called a `` lifetime lottery , '' which would establish a game-of-chance lottery in Alabama to fund education . They said it would be like the Tennessee lottery , which applies revenues for educational scholarships .
Cobb 's interest in an education lottery harkens back to when Don Siegelman was the last Democrat to win a governor 's race . Siegelman campaigned for voter approval of a state lottery in 1998 , but their efforts stalled one year later when voters defeated a free-standing referendum asking for one to be implemented .
Said Cobb , `` It will mean extra money in an education trust fund and increase jobs and increase income taxes . It will have a huge impact . ''
They and Maddox are also committed to participating in debates . Other Republicans have committed to debates as well , including Hightower .
`` This is an issue of picking the right person with the right business experience who is qualified to take Alabama to a new level , '' Hightower said . `` That is what I believe the voters will be looking for . What we do n't need is another destructive campaign between two candidates , as we have seen previously , that does not serve Alabama 's greater purpose . ''
David Mowery , an Alabama campaign consultant , said if the GOP primary turns ugly , it will give the Democrats a chance to win the governor 's seat .
Republican voters , similar to this past year in the Senate election , could be selecting their nominee in a runoff . Jones won enough votes to avoid a runoff , and if the Democratic gubernatorial primary consists of only Cobb and Maddox , they will have avoided a runoff again .
`` I think if the Republicans have a really knock-down , drag-out fight and it goes to a runoff or its heated and a lot of their people are angered and they stay home and then you have a talented candidate like Sue Bell Cobb or Walt Maddox , you can see a scenario like you saw before , '' Mowery said . `` I do n't know if I would bet on it , but I could see it happening . ''
Fording is taking bets : They call Cobb a longshot at winning if they survive the primary .
`` It helps a lot that this will be a congressional midterm year , as the turnout is generally lower across-the-board , '' they said . `` This will make a Democratic surge in a turnout more influential in the outcome , as it was for the special Senate election . But even under the most optimistic scenario , I would still have to think they enter the general election as a two-touchdown underdog . ''

What 's the purpose of signing a form ? On the simplest level , a signature is simply a way to make someone legally responsible for the content of the form . But in addition to the legal aspect , the signature is an appeal to personal integrity , forcing people to consider whether they 're comfortable attaching their identity to something that may not be completely true .
Based on some figures in a new PNAS paper , the signatures on most forms are miserable failures , at least from the latter perspective . The IRS estimates that it misses out on about $ 175 billion because people misrepresent their income or deductions . And the insurance industry calculates that it loses about $ 80 billion annually due to fraudulent claims . But the same paper suggests a fix that is as simple as tweaking the form . Forcing people to sign before they complete the form greatly increases their honesty .
It should n't be a surprise that signing at the end of a form does not promote accurate reporting , given what we know about human psychology . `` Immediately after lying , '' the paper 's authors write , `` individuals quickly engage in various mental justifications , reinterpretations , and other 'tricks ' such as suppressing thoughts about their moral standards that allow them to maintain a positive self-image despite having lied . '' By the time they get to the actual request for a signature , they 've already made their peace with lying : `` When signing comes after reporting , the morality train has already left the station . ''
The problem is n't with the signature itself . Lots of studies have shown that focusing the attention on one 's self , which a signature does successfully , can cause people to behave more ethically . The problem comes from its placement after the lying has already happened . So , the authors posited a quick fix : stick the signature at the start . Their hypothesis was that `` signing one 's name before reporting information ( rather than at the end ) makes morality accessible right before it is most needed , which will consequently promote honest reporting . ''
To test this proposal , they designed a series of forms that required self reporting of personal information , either involving performance on a math quiz where higher scores meant higher rewards , or the reimbursable travel expenses involved in getting to the study 's location . The only difference among the forms ? Some did not ask for a signature , some put the signature on top , and some placed it in its traditional location , at the end .
In the case of the math quiz , the researchers actually tracked how well the participants had performed . With the signature at the end , a full 79 percent of the participants cheated . Somewhat fewer cheated when no signature was required , though the difference was not statistically significant . But when the signature was required on top , only 37 percent cheated—less than half the rate seen in the signature-at-bottom group . A similar pattern was seen when the authors analyzed the extent of the cheating involved .
Although they did n't have complete information on travel expenses , the same pattern prevailed : people who were given the signature-on-top form reported fewer expenses than either of the other two groups .
The authors then repeated this experiment , but added a word completion task , where participants were given a series of blanks , some filled in with letters , and asked to complete the word . These completion tasks were set up so that they could be answered with neutral words or with those associated with personal ethics , like `` virtue . '' They got the same results as in the earlier tests of cheating , and the word completion task showed that the people who had signed on top were more likely to fill in the blanks to form ethics-focused words . This supported the contention that the early signature put people in an ethical state of mind prior to completion of the form .
But the really impressive part of the study came from its real-world demonstration of this effect . The authors got an unnamed auto insurance company to send out two versions of its annual renewal forms to over 13,000 policyholders , identical except for the location of the signature . One part of this form included a request for odometer readings , which the insurance companies use to calculate typical miles travelled , which are proportional to accident risk . These are used to calculate insurance cost—the more you drive , the more expensive it is .
Those who signed at the top reported nearly 2,500 miles more than the ones who signed at the end .
Although the authors do n't say so explicitly , they suggest we 'd be pretty stupid not to adopt this simple , inexpensive fix . Calling it a `` gentle nudge , '' they note that putting signatures on top `` does not impose on the freedom of individuals , it does not require the passage of new legislation , and it can profoundly influence behaviors of ethical and economic significance . '' The only caution they add is that we might eventually adapt to the difference , and its effect will lessen—or , as they put it , `` individuals may find new 'tricks to disengage from morality . ''

Chaos Walking , starring Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley , is set to hit theaters March 1 , 2019 .
Doug Liman is directing the post-apocalyptic thriller , an adaptation of the best-selling YA novel by Patrick Ness , for Lionsgate .
The story takes place in a world where all women have been killed by a germ and all living creatures can hear one another 's thoughts in a stream of images , words and sounds called Noise . Holland stars as a boy forced to flee their town with their loyal dog who comes upon a strange sight : a girl ( Ridley ) .
Holland currently stars in Sony and Marvel Studios ' Spider-Man : Homecoming as the latest actor to play the iconic web-slinger . Ridley will next be seen in Murder on the Orient Express and the upcoming Star Wars film The Last Jedi .
Oscar-winning screenwriter Charlie Kaufman worked on the script for Chaos Walking , as did Jamie Linden ( Money Monster ) .
ENGLEWOOD , Colo. -- When Jon Gruden looks at the Denver Broncos ' quarterbacks , they see the proverbial glass as potentially full twice over .
As in ESPN 's Monday Night Football analyst believes Paxton Lynch is still a quality prospect despite not winning the Broncos ' quarterback job . And Gruden believes there is a reason , several actually , that Trevor Siemian did win their second consecutive training camp competition and will be behind center for the Broncos .
`` And man , am I impressed with [ Siemian ] , what they did their first year as a starter , '' Gruden said . `` Taking over from Peyton Manning , there 's a lot to like in Siemian . He 's a steady , no-nonsense guy that has a good feel for the pocket , they know how to get the ball to these marquee receivers . ''
Jon Gruden believes Paxton Lynch and Trevor Siemian will develop into quality NFL starters . Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports
Gruden is a longtime quarterback coach who was an NFL head coach for 11 seasons combined with the Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Their teams were 100-85 , won five division titles combined and the Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII in their tenure .
They made their comments Wednesday afternoon as part of a media conference call to preview the start of the NFL 's regular season , including a Monday Night Football doubleheader featuring Denver . Gruden and Sean McDonough will be at the New Orleans Saints-Minnesota Vikings game while Beth Mowins and Rex Ryan will be in Denver for the Broncos-Los Angeles Chargers game .
Gruden , who also had extended conversations with Lynch in the weeks before the 2016 draft as part of their `` Gruden 's QB Camp '' with the top quarterbacks in each draft , believes Lynch can still make progress toward being a starter . They added the Broncos ' depth chart at the position is somewhat unique given the two quarterbacks are so close in age and experience level as Siemian is in their third season and Lynch is in their second .
`` They 're in an interesting situation because they 're trying to split the reps between two young quarterbacks that need all they can get , '' Gruden said . `` I do n't think it 's over , I think Lynch will stay on the gas pedal and still be a player in this league , whether it 's in Denver or someplace else . ''
From a coaching perspective , Gruden said both former coach Gary Kubiak 's staff last summer and Vance Joseph 's staff this summer had a difficult challenge in making sure each quarterback had the opportunity to get the same work as the other in practice and in the first two preseason games .
`` I think it 's really hard , it was hard on Kubiak , I 'm sure it 's hard on the current staff in Denver as well to make it fair , '' Gruden said . `` To not only make it fair , but to do what each quarterback does best ... I think they probably made it as fair as they could . ''
NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is at it again . After having very positive things to say about Switch during the company 's latest financial call earlier in the week , he 's now spoken about it very positively with GamesBeat , noting that “ it was such a ground-breaking design . ”
When asked why NVIDIA went after Switch , Huang said :
“ We 're dedicated to the gaming market and always have been . Some parts of the market , we just were n't prepared to serve them . I was fairly open about how , when this current generation of consoles was being considered , we did n't have x86 CPUs . We were n't in contention for any of those . However , the other factor is whether we could really make a contribution or not . If a particular game console does n't require our special skills , what we can uniquely bring , then it 's a commodity business that may not be suited for us . In the case of Switch , it was such a ground-breaking design . Performance matters , because games are built on great performance , but form factor and energy efficiency matter incredibly , because they want to build something that 's portable and transformable . The type of gameplay they want to enable is like nothing the world has so far . It 's a scenario where two great engineering teams , working with their creative teams , needed to hunker down . Several hundred engineering years went into building this new console . It 's the type of project that really inspires us , gets us excited . It 's a classic win-win . ”
Huang mentioned a few days ago that people will be “ amazed ” by Switch . They also believe that NVIDIA 's relationship with Nintendo could last as long as two decades .

Foxtel is set to come under intense scrutiny when it reports fourth-quarter results next month amid evidence that a considerable number of its customers has abandoned its drama and movie packs – some of them in favour of new , cheaper streaming services led by Netflix .
The cable and satellite TV monopoly , which is owned by News Corp and Telstra , has experienced significant `` spin-down '' – customers cherry-picking channels and cutting their bills – since it changed its pricing model in November . Sources are divided on whether the negative reaction has been comfortably within the anticipated range .
Would a cut to licence fees save commercial networks ? Credit : Viki Lascaris
Despite this , Foxtel is expected to have grown its subscriber base rapidly in the period to June 30 , helped by chief executive Richard Freudenstein 's decision to slash the price of its basic service from $ 49 to $ 25 and give households more chances to select which channels they want to receive .
The company , which makes about $ 1 billion in underlying profit – more than the three metropolitan commercial free-to-air network owners combined – is also expected to report record low churn ( the percentage of customers defecting ) .
RICHMOND , Texas - A man was arrested Tuesday in Fort Bend County after officials said they tried to vote twice .
According to county election officials , 62-year-old Phillip Cook , of Richmond , voted early last week at a poll in the First Colony area of Sugar Land .
Cook had returned to Great Oaks Baptist Church in the block of FM 2759 on Tuesday .
Officials said poll workers noticed that Cook appeared to have already voted , and thought that it may have been a mistake in the roll . However , when poll workers confronted them about the problem , they admitted that they were trying to vote twice to “ test the system . ”
A deputy who was conducting traffic control at the site arrested Cook .
They were charged illegal attempt to vote , which is a second-degree felony . Cook 's court appearance is Wednesday morning as they remain in Fort Bend County Jail .

Pacman and Peso , whose real names are Anthony Bobb and Dontray Ennis ended their trip to North Korea on Saturday arrived in Beijing , after spending five days in North Korea to film their music video , which funded by Kickstarter campaign . ( AP Photo/Andy Wong )
BEIJING ( AP ) — Two aspiring American rappers said Saturday that they had filmed part of a music video in North Korea , hoping the novel locale will make a hit .
The rappers known as Pacman and Peso did not say where and how they filmed the footage , which their fundraising proposal suggested would be done on a karaoke party bus in Pyongyang .
Their custom trip was arranged through a travel agency specializing in taking Westerners to North Korea , according to the proposal .
Americans are able to travel to North Korea on arranged tours and are constantly accompanied by North Korea minders .
After an elderly American was detained in the country , the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning on Nov. 19 , advising against all travel by U.S. citizens to North Korea .
The two rappers said their trip shied away from politics .
`` I mean we did not go there to be political . We just go down there to shoot our video and that about the reason why we went , not political , '' said Pacman — whose real name is Anthony Bobb .
The duo from the Washington area spoke to reporters at an airport in Beijing upon their return from a five-day trip to North Korea .
`` Nobody shot a video in North Korea , let alone thought of it . Nobody even thought of making a video in North Korea . You know what I 'm saying ? '' said Peso , whose real name is Dontray Ennis .
They raised more than $ 10,000 on the crowdsourcing site Kickstarter to fund their trip .
The rappers said the unusual move could jumpstart their music careers . They hope to release the video next month .
North Korea has detained at least six Americans since 2009 , including journalists accused of trespassing and others accused of trying to spread Christianity . North Korea state media claimed Saturday that 85-year-old Korean War veteran Merrill Newman had apologized for committing `` hostile acts '' against the state during a trip in October , but the report could not be independently verified .
The rappers said they encountered no problem while in North Korea . `` They treated us well , like I was sick out there for good two days and they took care of me until I got over the sickness , '' Peso said .
When you 've written a new code module in a language like C/C++ , you can compile it into WebAssembly using a tool like Emscripten . Let 's look at how it works .
Emscripten Environment Setup
First , let 's set up the required development environment .
Prerequisites
Get the Emscripten SDK , using these instructions : https : //kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
Compiling an example
With the environment set up , let 's look at how to use it to compile a C example to Emscripten . There are a number of options available when compiling with Emscripten , but the main two scenarios we 'll cover are :
Compiling to wasm and creating HTML to run our code in , plus all the JavaScript `` glue '' code needed to run the wasm in the web environment .
Compiling to wasm and just creating the JavaScript .
We will look at both below .
Creating HTML and JavaScript
This is the simplest case we 'll look at , whereby you get emscripten to generate everything you need to run your code , as WebAssembly , in the browser .
First we need an example to compile . Take a copy of the following simple C example , and save it in a file called hello.c in a new directory on your local drive : # include < stdio.h > int main ( int argc , char * * argv ) { printf ( `` Hello World
`` ) ; } Now , using the terminal window you used to enter the Emscripten compiler environment , navigate to the same directory as your hello.c file , and run the following command : emcc hello.c -s WASM=1 -o hello.html
The options we 've passed in with the command are as follows :
-s WASM=1 — Specifies that we want wasm output . If we do n't specify this , Emscripten will just output asm.js , as it does by default .
— Specifies that we want wasm output . If we do n't specify this , Emscripten will just output asm.js , as it does by default . -o hello.html — Specifies that we want Emscripten to generate an HTML page to run our code in ( and a filename to use ) , as well as the wasm module and the JavaScript `` glue '' code to compile and instantiate the wasm so it can be used in the web environment .
At this point in your source directory you should have :
The binary wasm module code ( hello.wasm )
) A JavaScript file containing glue code to translate between the native C functions , and JavaScript/wasm ( hello.js )
) An HTML file to load , compile , and instantiate your wasm code , and display its output in the browser ( hello.html )
Running your example
Now all that remains is for you to load the resulting hello.html in a browser that supports WebAssembly . It is enabled by default in Firefox 52+ and Chrome 57+/the latest Opera ( you can also run wasm code in Firefox 47+ by enabling the javascript.options.wasm flag in about : config , or Chrome ( 51+ ) and Opera ( 38+ ) by going to chrome : //flags and enabling the Experimental WebAssembly flag . )
If everything has worked as planned , you should see `` Hello world '' output in the Emscripten console appearing on the web page , and your browser 's JavaScript console . Congratulations , you 've just compiled C to WebAssembly and run it in your browser !
Using a custom HTML template
Sometimes you will want to use a custom HTML template . Let 's look at how we can do this .
First of all , save the following C code in a file called hello2.c , in a new directory : # include < stdio.h > int main ( int argc , char * * argv ) { printf ( `` Hello World
`` ) ; } Search for the file shell_minimal.html in your emsdk repo . Copy it into a sub-directory called html_template inside your previous new directory . Now navigate into your new directory ( again , in your Emscripten compiler environment terminal window ) , and run the following command : emcc -o hello2.html hello2.c -O3 -s WASM=1 -- shell-file html_template/shell_minimal.html The options we 've passed are slightly different this time : We 've specified -o hello2.html , meaning that the compiler will still output the JavaScript glue code and .html .
, meaning that the compiler will still output the JavaScript glue code and . We 've also specified -- shell-file html_template/shell_minimal.html — this provides the path to the HTML template you want to use to create the HTML you will run your example through . Now let 's run this example . The above command will have generated hello2.html , which will have much the same content as the template with some glue code added into load the generated wasm , run it , etc . Open it in your browser and you 'll see much the same output as the last example .
Note : You could specify outputting just the JavaScript `` glue '' file * rather than the full HTML by specifying a .js file instead of an HTML file in the -o flag , e.g . emcc -o hello2.js hello2.c -O3 -s WASM=1 . You could then build your custom HTML completely from scratch , although this is an advanced approach ; it is usually easier to use the provided HTML template . * Emscripten requires a large variety of JavaScript `` glue '' code to handle memory allocation , memory leaks , and a host of other problems
Calling a custom function defined in C
If you have a function defined in your C code that you want to call as needed from JavaScript , you can do this using the Emscripten ccall ( ) function , and the EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE declaration ( which adds your functions to the exported functions list ( see Why do functions in my C/C++ source code vanish when I compile to JavaScript , and/or I get No functions to process ? ) ) . Let 's look at how this works .
To start with , save the following code as hello3.c in a new directory : # include < stdio.h > # include < emscripten/emscripten.h > int main ( int argc , char * * argv ) { printf ( `` Hello World
`` ) ; } # ifdef __cplusplus extern `` C '' { # endif void EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE myFunction ( int argc , char * * argv ) { printf ( `` MyFunction Called
`` ) ; } # ifdef __cplusplus } # endif By default , Emscripten-generated code always just calls the main ( ) function , and other functions are eliminated as dead code . Putting EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE before a function name stops this from happening . You also need to import the emscripten.h library to use EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE . Note : We are including the # ifdef blocks so that if you are trying to include this in C++ code , the example will still work . Due to C versus C++ name mangling rules , this would otherwise break , but here we are setting it so that it treats it as an external C function if you are using C++ . Now add html_template/shell_minimal.html into this new directory too , just for convenience ( you 'd obviously put this in a central place in your real dev environment ) . Now let 's run the compilation step again . From inside your latest directory ( and while inside your Emscripten compiler environment terminal window ) , compile your C code with the following command . ( Note that we need to compile with NO_EXIT_RUNTIME , which is necessary as otherwise when main ( ) exits the runtime would be shut down — necessary for proper C emulation , e.g. , atexits are called — and it would n't be valid to call compiled code . ) emcc -o hello3.html hello3.c -O3 -s WASM=1 -- shell-file html_template/shell_minimal.html -s NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=1 -s EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS= ' [ `` ccall '' ] ' If you load the example in your browser again , you 'll see the same thing as before ! Now we need to run our new myFunction ( ) function from JavaScript . First of all , open up your hello3.html file in a text editor . Add a < button > element as shown below , just above the first opening < script type='text/javascript ' > tag . < button class= '' mybutton '' > Run myFunction < /button > Now add the following code at the end of the first < script > element : document.querySelector ( '.mybutton ' ) .addEventListener ( 'click ' , function ( ) { alert ( 'check console ' ) ; var result = Module.ccall ( 'myFunction ' , // name of C function null , // return type null , // argument types null ) ; // arguments } ) ;
This illustrates how ccall ( ) is used to call the exported function .

Through a third of the current fiscal year , Indiana is about $ 61 million below target , which is about 6 percent off the mark .
In October , Indiana faced the first significant revenue shortfall this fiscal year . file photo
Updated Nov. 10 , 10:20 a.m .
INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana last month faced the first significant revenue shortfall this fiscal year , collecting $ 64 million less than expected .
A processing error shifted more than $ 86 million in tax revenue collected in September to October 's balance sheets . After accounting for that shift , the state fell short of its target revenue by nearly 6 percent last month .
Through a third of the current fiscal year , that puts Indiana about $ 61 million below the target of $ 4.57 billion , or 1.3 % .
The biggest losses in October came in sales tax and corporate income tax collections , which were off by about $ 27 million and $ 35 million , respectively . Corporate taxes in particular fell short , 107 percent below projections . The State Budget Agency says higher corporate refunds contributed to that shortfall . Indiana will release a new revenue forecast next month .
Correction : An earlier version of this story said Indiana was 6 % below its revenue target for the fiscal year . It should have said revenue is down 1.3 % for the fiscal year .
In the UK we have a tax called VAT ( Value added tax ) , which Wikipedia describes as “ a tax on the purchase price ” . In other words , when you buy something , part of the price you pay goes to VAT instead of the company selling you the product . The standard VAT rate is currently 20 % in the UK . This means if a UK company sells some software for £100 , they have to pay £16.66 VAT on the sale ( not £20 - because the price is really £83.33 , which if you add 20 % totals £100 ) . Unfortunately , old-fashioned UK laws make this process ridiculous for modern software distribution .
VAT rates can vary depending on sector and with various schemes such as flat VAT . Startups in the UK do n't have to register for VAT immediately , but it deserves consideration since it is inevitable if the company does well . Being VAT registered also can allow you to claim VAT back on business expenses . However software startups like ours tend to sell a lot and buy relatively little , so this does n't favour us much at all .
Usually when you sell an item , you do n't have to pay VAT if the customer is outside the EU . However , as we distribute our Construct 2 licenses digitally , HMRC have decided we have to pay VAT on all our sales regardless of where the sale originated . We phoned up HMRC , who passed us on to their technical team , who then advised us to write in with our queries which we did to confirm all of this .
This is now where we get slapped round the face with the big moth-eaten tax rule book where the Internet has not yet been prophesised .
If we send a physical CD in the post with a Construct license on it , this would count as a physical good . We would n't have to pay VAT on the sale if the customer is outside the EU . Thanks for buying Construct 2 ! We 've followed AOL 's footsteps and decided to send it to you as a CD in the post !
If we were to send the license file in paper format , this could possibly also count as a physical good . Thanks for buying Construct 2 , here 's your license certificate , please copy all 9 lines out to a text file without making any mistakes at all !
And if we simply send an email , we get charged significantly more tax .
Suppose it costs on average £4 to post said CDs and/or paper licenses to a customer in the USA . Suppose we sell a business license there , currently £229 . We could save £34 by sending a CD instead of emailing them . Not a bad saving for a few minutes work .
So we have a couple of options :
Email the licenses , pay the VAT and suck up a big loss
Send CDs and paper licenses to customers not in the EU
Option 1 is very expensive . Option 2 saves us a lot of money but has other downsides :
No one wants a stupid CD with 1kb text file on it ( if it takes 2 weeks to deliver this it is an average data transfer rate of 1 bit every 2.5 minutes , it 'd be quicker to beep at them down the phone )
No one wants a paper license certificate
It wastes our time
It wastes customers time
It could confuse customers ( why am I entering my physical address to get an email ? Why do I have both an email and a CD ? )
We could actually lose sales , since customers might not want to enter their address ( it should n't be necessary after all )
It 's environmentally wasteful ( an airmailed CD with a 1kb text file on it )
It 's ridiculous we 're put in this position by nonsensical laws
It 's not exactly an easy choice to make . The majority of our sales come from outside the EU . The second option is ridiculous , but could save enough money to hire someone . The first option is the most practical , but could cost us thousands of pounds .
HMRC failed to respond to a question about whether we 're allowed to email the customer a license file as a backup , in addition to posting them the CD . So there would still be a few details to iron out if we did decide to start mailing out CDs . It 's frustrating to figure out what we should do when HMRC themselves ca n't tell us .
As two young and highly motivated founders , the option of moving our whole business to the US ( where both culture and legislation are supportive of startups ) is becoming increasingly tempting and actually seems like an exciting opportunity and adventure . New startup visas to the US are helping make the option increasingly viable .
Maybe this is why the UK is lacking well known software companies . It 's expensive , we have tax laws that desperately need updating , and HMRC do n't have all the answers ( the ones they do imply silly tradeoffs ) . We hear a lot of noise from the UK government about how keen they are to help startups . But how can we stay competitive with US companies when we have to deal with all this , and they do n't ?

From `` Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy '' to `` Thnks fr th Mmrs '' these four dudes from Chicago most likely played a crucial role in your teenage pop-punk years . If you spent countless hours standing in the rain at Warped Tour just to see them play , or were a member of their actual fan club Overcast Kids ( yes , it existed , and we even got our own membership cards ) then you probably panicked in anticipation over their latest album , American Beauty/American Psycho , which unsurprisingly debuted this week at No . 1 . If a new album was n't enough , they just announced a summer co-headlining tour — Boys of Zummer — with Wiz Khalifa and special guest Hoodie Allen . So with all this excitement ahead , we had the guys stop by BuzzFeed NY to chat all about their new album , life on tour , and their favorite memories throughout the past decade . 1 . What 's the one thing you have to bring on the road with you ? Joe : Wallet Patrick : Always need a wallet . We need guitars , and drums and things . Pete : Baby wipes . You know ? It 's like a shower .

Joe : Or walk up on stage , say hi . Patrick : ( shakes head ) No . 3 . Are you for or against fan signs at shows ? Patrick : It 's very hard to read signs on stage . People are always like , `` Yeah ! Look at the thing ! '' And I 'm just like , `` I am ! I do n't see what it says ! But I 'm glad you wrote . '' Pete : Funny signs are great . I love when kids have like legitimately great senses of humor . The giant heads are cool too , but I feel bad for the people behind . Andy : Yeah , I mostly feel bad about signs , because it obscures people 's view . Like those giant light-up signs . Patrick : I always wonder where the light comes from . Where are they getting their power ? ! 4 . What are your favorite snacks to bring on the tour bus ? Joe : Whatever my mom packed me for lunch . Pete : Whiskey . Andy : Potato chips .

5 . What 's the weirdest fan request you 've ever gotten ? Patrick : Once , someone asked me to sign their pacemaker . And of course I did , because why not ? That 's awesome . 6 . What was the most memorable concert you 've ever played ? Pete : The time that we played Obama 's inauguration and the Secret Service said if we ran , we were a potential target . ( laughs ) The show was awesome . Patrick : There are snipers — if you run , you may be shot . Be prepared . Pete : I think that 's one of those things where you do n't even sign a release . It 's just like , `` You got fuckin ' shot , sorry . '' 7 . Do you have any rituals that you do right before you go on stage ? Patrick : Human sacrifice . Joe : Yeah , I burn potions in the forest . Pete : Prayer circle , black magic . So you guys are like The Craft , just the male version . Joe : Yeah , just four chicks just hanging out , being ladies . You know , that 's us , The Craft !

8 . What 's your favorite music video that you 've ever made ? Pete : I 'll just answer for Patrick : `` Thanks for the Memories . '' Patrick : Going off of that , I really liked `` Take Over , The Breaks Over '' because it was the shortest shoot we 've ever done . Joe : Actually , American Beauty/American Psycho [ was ] . Patrick : Oh , yes ! Oh my goodness . That 's easily my favorite video to shoot . Joe : That was like a 15-minute shoot . Literally . Pete : Or the `` My Songs '' video might have been . It was so short it was almost like we were n't there . Andy : I do n't like wasting my talent on videos with these guys , I want to play Star Wars all day . That 's where my talent belongs . 9 . What was the last song you forgot lyrics to ? Patrick : I forget a lot of words . That happens on a regular basis . The other day I did a little cheer when I got through two new songs in a row , because I was like , Yay , Patrick ! You remembered all those words ! Joe : The acoustic shows are the ones that I remember . Patrick : Yeah , yeah , yeah . I forgot an entire verse and it 's an acoustic show , so there 's nothing you can do . You just hear everything , and I just could n't call it out — I was just like , Yeah , I do n't remember . I just do n't . You 're supposed to pretend like it was a plan and be like , Yeah , everyone , you sing it ! Sing along ! I 'm gon na follow you now ! But I tend to just let it happen — I like when we make mistakes because then you know that we 're real . Pete : I get a lot of side-eye when it happens . Patrick : Because I know he 's got some smarmy thing he 's gon na say ! He 's gon na be like , Oooh , good job , Patrick ! And I 'm just like , Do n't ! Pete : And good job implies bad job . Patrick : Yes , sarcasm .

10 . What 's your favorite Wiz Khalifa song ? Pete : There 's already a mashup of `` Sugar We 're Goin ' Down '' out there that people should check out that some kid made .

Andy : Kill Bill . Pete : Yeah , Kill Bill era . Joe : I like Pulp Fiction . 12 . What 's your favorite movie : American Beauty or American Psycho ? Patrick and Andy : Star Wars . Patrick : Between American Beauty and American Psycho we 'd say Star Wars , yeah . 13 . Is there a song you wish you had put out as a single ? Patrick : All I know is that every time I have an opinion on what song should be a single , what song should be on the record , I am always wrong . Always . So , guaranteed we should n't listen to me . I write some songs , and then I have no good opinion about them . Pete : But lots of opinions ! Patrick : Oh , yeah . I do n't mean to misspeak here . I have lots of opinions , I 'm very opinionated about it . Joe : The reality is , we 're a band of four people and we also have other people we look to for counsel , and it goes through a lot of people . Pete : Sometimes Patrick 's opinion is like a grease fire and we do keep throwing water on it for a minute . Patrick : It 's fun to watch me sizzle . Joe : To be fair to Patrick , I always end up liking our B-sides a lot . And I always have regrets about — I 'm the only one that regrets — them not being on the record .

14 . Was it a conscious choice to go from sentence-long song titles to one word ? Pete : I think at some point , everything about it 's the art and the expectation becomes — you know people expect a certain thing all time , and you 've got ta sorta challenge that as an artist . But it 's not like , Now there will never be a long one ! Patrick : Just when it 's the novelty of like , Oh , what kooky song titles are they cooking up now ! Pete : When someone becomes more a fan of the song titles than the songs , it 's a problem . ( laughs ) 15 . What 's your craziest Warped Tour memory ? Joe : Just how warped the whole thing was . Pete : The time our bus AC broke down and it was 100 degrees at night and I threw a fan down the hall , and our buddy stuck their head out and the fan comes [ by him ] and they just moved right by . Serendipity . 16 . You 're known for very verbose song titles — are there alternate titles that you wish you had used or not ? Pete : I wish we had named on a song on this record `` Where Are the Fucking Guitars . '' ( laughs )

Origen was an ex post facto heretic , anathematised by the second council of Constantinople in 553 , some three centuries after their death .
Alexandria , Origen 's birthplace , was the intellectual center of the Hellenistic world and a hotbed of speculative Platonic philosophy . In the first century Philo of Alexandria had , through their biblical exegesis , attempted to fuse Platonism and Judaism . Origen , with greater success , sought to merge Christianity with Greek philosophy .
It was however Origen 's Platonism that did them in . Following Plato , they subscribed to the doctrine of pre-existent souls , which was not acceptable according to the orthodox industry standard that was later established . On Origen 's account , God 's first creation , before time , was a collectivity of souls . Of these , all but one , the human soul of Christ , fell away . In the end , however , all humans and every spirit , even the devil , would be saved , returning to a state of `` pure mind '' .
Reading this one asks : where is it all coming from – the hierarchy of incorporeal , conscious beings , the precosmic fall , the apotheosis of all souls at the end of time ? There is no argument for this grand cosmological story . The only argument is in the elaboration of metaphysical machinery through which it is articulated . But one could say the same for other Hellenistic philosophers , including Origen 's contemporary Plotinus – a fellow student of the ur-Neoplatonist Ammonias Saccus . Origen was on the cutting edge of Hellenistic philosophy , characterised by speculative metaphysics , mysticism and plain flakiness .
Origen was also on the cutting edge of biblical scholarship as the first Christian theologian to learn Hebrew in order to read the Hebrew Bible . Like Philo , Origen read scripture allegorically . The Bible was divinely inspired , they held , but since so many of the stories in the Bible were clearly false and even ridiculous , God 's intention must have been that they not be taken literally .
`` What intelligent person '' , Origen asked , `` can imagine that there was a first `` day '' , then a second and a third `` day '' – evening and morning – without the sun , the moon , and the stars … Who is foolish enough to believe that , like a human gardener , God planted a garden in Eden … I can not imagine that anyone will doubt that these details point symbolically to spiritual meanings , by using an historical narrative which did not literally happen . ''
Origen 's theology was always controversial , but it has always been controversial whether Origen should be regarded as a heretic . Impeccably orthodox theologians admired him . Saints Basil and Gregory of Nazianzus collected their works as the Philocalia of Origen and promulgated them ; St Jerome translated over 80 of their sermons for the edification of western readers deficient in Greek .
During their lifetime , Origen 's orthodoxy was never questioned and even later the chief bone of contention was their doctrine of the pre-existence of souls – including the human soul of Christ . Their fanciful interpretations of the Bible were no worry , biblical literalism being a modern invention . Even their doctrine of universal salvation was not clearly unacceptable . The emperor Justinian , an avid amateur theologian keen on eternal damnation , pressed the second council of Constantinople to condemn this doctrine , but the bishops did not ratify their proposal : St Clement of Alexandria and St Gregory of Nyssa , both known universalists , survived with their sanctity intact .
It 's hard to imagine what Origen , or their orthodox contemporaries , would make of contemporary Christianity . I suspect they would find the conservative evangelical variety unintelligible and would even be puzzled by `` mainline '' Christianity . Why , they 'd wonder , were these third millennium Christians so utterly indifferent to vital metaphysical questions ? Why did they care about the historical accuracy of biblical narratives ? Why were they so interested in stories about the human Jesus and so little concerned about the metaphysics of the logos , which became incarnate ? Why was their Christianity so simplistic , prosaic , anti-intellectual and deadly dull ?
I got religion as an undergraduate , reading church history and the Greek fathers of the church . I was taken by the romance of late antiquity in the east , fantasising a world where metaphysics and mysticism were popular pastimes , where , as Gregory of Nyssa reports , shopkeepers and laborers argued fine points of theology in the streets . If I had been brought up with the puerile , prosaic religion of Sunday school Jesus-stories , church rummage sales , happy-clappy services and self-help programs , dull sentimentalities and dull moralism – I would never have given Christianity a shake .
Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes refused to answer whether they voted for Barack Obama not one , not two , but four times during an interview Thursday .
“ I respect the sanctity of the ballot box , and I know the members of this editorial board do as well , ” Grimes said .
“ So you 're not going to answer ? ” the interviewer asked .
“ Again , I do n't think that the president is on the ballot , as much as Mitch McConnell might want them to be , ” Grimes said . “ It 's my name , and it 's going to be me who 's holding them accountable for the failed decisions and votes that they have made against the people of Kentucky . ”
Grimes has repeatedly refused to answer questions about their voting record and has made efforts to distance themselves from President Obama .

About
The Backstory
Nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont lies the Randall Drive-In Theatre , the world 's smallest remaining drive-in . The theatre was built literally in Al Randall 's back yard and has been providing family affordable fun under the stars ever since . Built in 1954 , and celebrating its 60th Anniversary this season , the Randall Drive-In Theatre is one of only 4 remaining drive-ins in the state of Vermont . Drive-Ins are a piece of Americana that once dotted the landscape with over 4,000 theaters during their heyday .
Randall Drive-In Theatre Original Marquee
The Randall Drive-In has stood the test of time enduring the 1980 's when other media options ( VHS , Cable ) became prevalent and attendance faltered . Even Mother Nature has impacted the drive-in with recent hurricanes Irene & Ida dropping the back field into the nearby White River and reducing the car capacity to below 150 making the Randall the smallest remaining drive-in . While all previous challenges have been met , digital cinema now threatens to close down this drive-in for good .
The last 8 years have seen the drive-in leased by different parties willing to run the theater as a “ community theatre ” , which has greatly benefited the area residents . As is often the case with leased drive-ins , they were run year- to-year without looking forward to the dangers that digital cinema would present . At the end of the 2012 season , many people believed it to be the last for the Randall Drive-In , a sentiment re-enforced when winter storms ravaged the screen .
Drive-In Screen April 2013 after winter storms
Seeking to restore the Randall to its former glory longtime patrons Adam Gerhard and Regina Franz formed Capture the Dream , LLC and leased the property for the 2013 season . They quickly set to work on renovating the theater . The entire projection booth was updated with high-end quality 35 mm equipment to provide the best possible picture on the newly repaired and painted screen :

An upcoming music video was shot this summer at the Randall :
Boston-based band Whispering Ghost 's upcoming debut music video being shot at the Randall Drive-In
The changes our company made to Randall had an immediate impact and the Randall is having the best season in over a quarter century with record attendance and sellout nights . We increased advertising as well as a new website and Facebook page which has people travelling from near and far just to spend a night under the stars with us .
The Challenge
After a record season , it has become quickly apparent that digital cinema wo n't wait a few more years as many originally believed . Our dream has been to run a drive-in movie theater and rather than have this renaissance season be a Swan Song for the Randall Drive-In , we are asking for assistance so our company can obtain a digital projector and we can keep running drive-ins for many years into the future .
Digital Cinema comes at a staggering price : $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 ! For the world 's smallest drive-in , funding this alone is not a viable option . We run virtually non-profit with our passion for drive-ins keeping the place open so local residents can enjoy family time under the stars . What we offer is an experience that is a throwback to simpler times . In the ever evolving digital world , it is important to preserve these opportunities for families to come together and enjoy time outside .
Patrons start gathering at the venerable Snack Bus as the drive-in opens for another night under the stars
We have put much effort into the theatre this year and are asking the community to help fund our companies ' quest to own a digital projector so we can keep running drive-ins and living our dream .
The future of cinema .... either we have one , or we go dark

Justin Welby , the Archbishop of Canterbury , stressed the need for a global focus when considering reform within the Church of England , specifically with regards to gay marriage , according to The Guardian .
As support for same-sex marriage grows in the West , Welby warned during an LBC Radio phone-in that if the Church of England were to accept gay marriages , it could lead to `` catastrophic '' consequences for Christians elsewhere , particularly in Africa .
`` I have stood by gravesides in Africa of a group of Christians who had been attacked because of something that had happened far , far away in America , and they were attacked by other people because of that , and a lot of them had been killed , '' said Welby .
`` We have to listen to that . We have to be aware of the fact , '' they said , according to The Guardian . `` Everything we say here goes round the world . ''
Were the Church of England to accept gay marriages , they commented , `` the impact of that on Christians far from here , in South Sudan , Pakistan , Nigeria and other places would be absolutely catastrophic . ''
Nonetheless Welby condemned homophobia and said , `` to treat every human being with equal importance and dignity is a fundamental part of being a Christian . '' They shared their particular concerns about the devastating impact of homophobia on gay teenagers , and reiterated the importance of a loving approach .
Welby said that they have been wrestling with the issue of protecting Christians abroad while still having a loving approach to gay Christians for a long time , but stressed the very real dangers that they had personally experienced .
They explained that the reasoning behind the massacre of Nigerian Christians was essentially , `` If we leave a Christian community here we will all be made to become homosexual and so we 're going to kill the Christians . ''
Bronze Test kicks off track action at 2016 Total 24 Hours of Spa
The three-hour Bronze Test for the 2016 Total 24 Hours of Spa gave the drivers plenty of opportunity to familiarise themselves with the iconic Belgian circuit earlier this afternoon . The Bronze Test was the first session of an action-packed week , which continues on Wednesday with the traditional and unique parade towards downtown Spa .
The three-hour practice session for the Bronze drivers on the Tuesday of the Total 24 Hours of Spa week was introduced last year , with the aim of giving less experienced drivers a feel for the Belgian circuit . With 37 cars participating in this year 's Bronze Test , drivers seized the opportunity with both hands , with most trying to maximise their track time . The most active of crews was the # 74 ISR Audi 's , which lapped the 7.004km Belgian track 49 times .
The fastest lap time went to the # 132 Lamborghini Gallardo of Australian squad Lago Racing , which clocked a 2m21.854s early in the session . Second was the # 53 AF Corse Ferrari , some four tenths slower than the Lamborghini , with the # 666 Barwell Motorsport Lamborghini Huracan in third . The top-three cars are all entered in the Pro-Am Cup , with the fastest of the Am Cup machines - the # 30 Team Parker Racing Bentley - finishing fourth .
Wednesday sees the traditional parade start at 4pm , with all cars making their way via public roads from the Spa track towards the town centre . All drivers will then participate in an hour-long autograph session from 5pm to 6pm , after which they will attend the drivers briefing in Spa 's Casino . The cars will travel back to the paddock at 7.30pm . The next track action is on Thursday , with the 90-minute-long free practice session starting at 1.20pm .

WASHINGTON — President Obama will propose a 10-year budget on Monday that stabilizes the federal deficit but does not seek balance , instead focusing on policies to address income inequality as they add nearly $ 6 trillion to the debt .
The budget — $ 4 trillion for the 2016 fiscal year — would hit corporations that park profits overseas , raise taxes on the richest of the rich and increase the incomes of the middle class through new spending and tax credits . Mr. Obama will challenge the newly elected Republican Congress to answer their emphasis on wage stagnation , according to congressional aides briefed on the details .
The central question that Mr. Obama 's budget will pose to Congress is this : Should Washington worry about what may be the defining economic issue of the era — the widening gap between the rich and everyone else — or should policymakers primarily seek to address a mountain of debt that the White House hopes to control but only marginally reduce as a share of the economy ?
The president 's budget , thicker than a phone book in multiple volumes , will be just the starting point for that discussion with Congress , representing their aspirations , not the final word . Criticism of Mr. Obama 's intentions arrived even before the budget was presented .
The key question being asked by investors in Chinese stocks – especially those offshore – right now seems to be whether the administrative intervention will impact critically needed market reforms . Most of the investors with whom we spoke tend to think that the recent policy changes have added uncertainty to the reform outlook , which is expected to revive and drive China 's economy . Many also worry that the chances of an early further liberalization of capital flows , let alone a more freely floating exchange rate , have fallen radically and that the inclusion of the yuan in the SDR basket ( a symbolic act of no substantive significance but an important prestige target for the Chinese leadership ) may be delayed .
The consequent question is then whether the onshore stock market has bottomed . We think it has not . After all , the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite ( 000001.SS ) and Shenzhen Composite are still up ~81.3 % and ~64.8 % respectively for the year , compared to +8.5 % and -0.4 % for S & P 500 in the U.S. and Heng Seng Index in Hong Kong respectively , over the same period of time . We think that it is likely that over the next 6 to12 months , we will see the onshore stock market converging to the pre-rally level ( i.e . SHCOMP 2000-2500 ) , as a slew of disappointing macro data and corporate earnings roll out .
The logic is simple . The underlying economy in China is weaker today than it was a year ago measured by construction , lingering industrial excess capacity , and sluggish consumption demand . While the stock market was not a very important part of the financial transmission mechanism and the equity issuance accounted for a small part of external corporate funding , therefore , the boom and bust has contained damage to an already weakening economy .
The Chinese authorities did nothing to discourage the stock market bubble . Many welcomed it because they saw it as a painless way of deleveraging excessively indebted corporate ( including SOEs ) and banking sectors . Then , when the market crashed following a minor tightening of margin requirements , they intervened in the most heavy-handed way imaginable .
Many Chinese and foreign investors will hesitate to go back into a market where you may not be able to get out when you want to ( even when the daily 10 % limit on individual stock price declines has not been reached ) , where you can be forced to buy more stock than you want to and where the authorities can compel private participants to put their money at risk by having to create a stabilization fund .
Those private investors willing to stay in this market or to enter it will now do so because they believe that it is a one-way bet , especially small retail investors , who are unlikely to be called upon to participate actively in future stock market rescue efforts . Stock prices go up , the private investor wins . Stock prices go down , the government ( or those large market participants it can bully ) buys enough stock to stop the price from falling . This artificial asymmetry will create and increase the likelihood of future bubbles , with a corresponding greater frequency and scope of future government rescue efforts and the expenditure of ever more resources , which will increasingly have to come , directly or indirectly , from the People 's Bank of China .
Today , the Chinese authorities are having an exit problem from their ill-conceived and poorly executed stock market support experiment . Luckily , the Chinese exit problem is mainly a domestic Chinese problem and even domestically , mainly a political and social stability issue , unlike the Fed 's exit . It is mainly a domestic problem because China is not yet fully financially integrated into the global economy . Many controls on international financial flows are still in place . Also , although foreigners have been able to access the Chinese A-shares market since November 2014 , most of the investors in these markets when the bubble burst were Chinese retail investors .
However , we believe that the real damage is to the critically important reform process leading to a much more market oriented open economy with much less government intervention than it is today . And the damage is to the reputation of the regulators and other financial institutions for competence . The only damage control solution is to pull the plug now and let the market find its own equilibrium , even though that may well fall below fair value .
The name BitTorrent has become part of most people 's day-to-day vernacular , synonymous with downloading every kind of content via the internet 's peer-to-peer networks . But if a team of US researchers have their way , we may all be talking about CarTorrent in the not too distant future .
Researchers from the University of California Los Angeles are working on a wireless communication network that will allow cars to talk to each other , simultaneously downloading information in the shape of road safety warnings , entertainment content and navigational tools .
The UCLA Engineering 's Network Research Lab team , led by Mario Gerla and Giovanni Pau , hit upon the idea in 2004 , when peer-to-peer networking took off fuelled by applications such as BitTorrent . `` We had the idea from BitTorrent , and decided to extend BitTorrent to cars under the name of CarTorrent . One of our dreams had always been to apply the technology to civilian applications , '' says Gerla . `` Imagine you 're driving to a beach resort and want to find out what the best beaches are . You could stop at a gas station and download several video clips from an internet access point , but that 's not very convenient . ''
Wireless at the wheel
Gerla and their team instead propose to connect cars to one another using the wireless networking platform they 're developing , which could be up and running by as early as 2012 .
The wireless network would allow moving vehicles within 100 metres and 300 metres of each other to connect and create a network with a wide range . The network would then allow drivers to download information from internet access points simply by driving by , and then share that information with other cars on the road .
Gerla says the benefits of such a network are numerous : `` There will be immediate benefits in driving safety as well as in content distribution . Car-to-car communications can be used to avoid accidents by alerting the drivers of imminent danger . To prevent a crash we must act in fractions of a second . We are currently collaborating with vehicle manufacturers to help reduce accidents and fatalities on the road . For this latter application , vehicles are equipped with sensing devices , such as radars and video cameras . ''
The network uses standard radio protocols such as Digital Short Range Communication , or DSRC , combined with wireless LAN technology at 5.9GHz ( not Wi-Fi 's 2.4GHz ) to create networks between vehicles equipped with onboard sensing devices . These devices can gather safety-related information as well as other complex multimedia data .
By far the most essential aspect of this network , though , is that it is not subject to memory , processing , storage and energy limitations like traditional sensor networks . Instead , it relies on the resources of the vehicle itself , along with those vehicles around it .
Under the scheme , cars would be able to use their onboard radios to exchange three categories of information : safe navigation ( such as reporting on icy road conditions , traffic jams and possible collisions ahead ) , content distribution ( locally relevant information , advertisements and videos of upcoming attractions ) and urban surveillance ( collecting information which could be used later by police for forensic investigations ) .
Gerla and their team are already collaborating with car manufacturers such as Toyota and BMW on bringing the project to life . However , costs and industry standards are the more important hurdles that this network will have to jump before it can become feasible . Gerla says the network can be slowly implemented , just as GPS navigation systems and Wi-Fi-style radios have slowly started to become standard equipment .
`` What will turn the tide will be the approval and widespread adoption of the emerging standards for car-to-car communications sponsored by the IEEE 802.11p Working Committee of the IEEE [ the professional association for the advancement of technology ] , '' says Gerla .
`` A few years ago , leading car manufacturers decided to join forces with national government agencies in the Vehicle Information Infrastructure Consortium , which works closely with the IEEE 802.11p Committee , to develop communications architecture to help drivers anticipate hazardous events or avoid bad traffic areas . ''
However , Gerla says the network is not without faults : `` The two most critical aspects that could go wrong if the network is implemented are location privacy , because drivers do not want others to know where they are ; and attacks where a driver could maliciously inject wrong traffic congestion information to persuade other drivers to get out of its way . ''
Defensive drivers
With costs currently estimated at around $ 500 ( £255 ) per car for the implementation of the equipment required to connect to the network , drivers probably wo n't be clamouring to get the kit .
`` Most likely , there will be at least initially two types of drivers , '' Gerla says . `` The drivers enamoured with high-tech features will immediately embrace this technology . But it 's true that less aggressive drivers , probably a sizeable fraction of the population , will be reluctant to embrace the technology at first . ''
That , of course , could present a problem for the growth of CarTorrent : for as anyone who has tried using BitTorrent will know , there 's no point in being the only person on a peer-to-peer network . Being the first car to use CarTorrent will be an expensive and pointless exercise . But like a telephone - and the internet - it 's the sort of technology whose benefits will multiply rapidly as long as more people use it .
It 's been a while , but I have reason to take up the blog again , I 've got three weeks to get my butt in gear and get my campaign ready to be played by my wonderful gaming group . Now , this is not the Grimm game I 've been talking about forever . My DM , Delusional Muse , convinced me to set a game in the same world as one of the novels I have written .
I decided that I would create a Pathfinder game set in my world of Isabia .
So far smooth sailing but some of the mechanics did n't fit the world I 'd created which has very limited magic and only two races .
So here is my solution to magic , Delusional Muse and I created a new mechanic :
Wizard , Sorcerer , Druid , and Cleric are no longer playable classes in my game . Magic ( Arcane ) and Magic ( Divine ) are feats . There are no spell level requirements . Spells must be learned , taught , or bestowed . Spell points per level = 1+ 1/2 int ( Arcane ) or 1/2 wis ( Divine ) modifier . Should a character take both magic feats it goes off of the higher modifier . Upon taking magic the player chooses 20 levels of spells known with 0 level spells costing 1/2 level each . Spells cost 1 point per level to cast , level 0 spells being free . Players can spend 1 temporary point of Con to gain 5 additional spell points , for every Con point sacrificed after the first they take an additional 1d4 con damage . Spell points are recovered at 1+ Wis or Int Modifier per hour . Additional spell points gained from sacrificing Con must be recovered before regular spell points are recovered .
In addition , all spell DCs are +5 because of the rare but potent nature of spells in this world
All spell like abilities are gained as normal , but spells require the magic feats .
I think it 's a nice system we got worked out but I 'd love to hear from you if you have any concerns about how it affects balance in the game .
The other problem I had with my setting is the races . Humans were easy enough because their mechanic is already written in the game . My other race is changelings . I know that the Pathfinder Advanced Races guide has a build for changelings but it did n't fit with the world I 'd created so Delusional Muse and I took a swing at creating our own version .
Changelings are quicker than humans , more adept at magic and have keen senses . They are however more fragile than humans and have a weakness to cold iron . They get : +2 Dex , -2Con +1 to spot , listen , and search Dark Vision +1 to spell DCs Vulnerability to Cold Iron
Let me know what you think .

Mathieu Comments on Return to Practice
Monday , Aug. 22
`` Coach told me I was going to get a couple plays in , and I thought about it and said , 'What are a couple of plays going to do for me ? ' So I pushed it a little bit , '' Mathieu said on Sunday after practice , per AZCentral.com 's Bob McManaman . `` My coaches , they kind of let me do my thing . I felt great , and I 'm pretty pleased with where I 'm at . ''
Mathieu Brings One of NFL 's Most Versatile Skill Sets to Arizona Secondary
Mathieu is coming off a breakout 2015 season , having reached the Pro Bowl and earned first-time All-Pro honors . Their year had a disappointing end , though , when they tore their ACL in December . The injury ruled them out for the remainder of the year , and their presence in the secondary was sorely missed as the Cardinals lost handily 49-15 to the Carolina Panthers in the NFC Championship Game .
Somewhat concerning is the fact that Mathieu also tore their ACL and LCL—albeit in the opposite knee—in December 2013 . As long as they stay healthy , the 24-year-old could potentially be one of the league 's most impactful defensive backs .
NFL Media 's Bucky Brooks analyzed why Mathieu is such an asset for the Cardinals :
Mathieu does n't get enough credit for their ability to create splash plays as an edge player on blitzes from their nickel corner or safety position . The tape demonstrates that they frequently attack running backs in the backfield on safety dogs off the edge . Mathieu displays impeccable timing on blitzes , but they also show outstanding anticipation , awareness and tackling skills corralling ball carriers in the backfield . This skill is underrated in evaluations of defensive backs , but Mathieu earns rave reviews for their work as a `` plus-one '' defender in the box . ... Mathieu 's extraordinary coverage skills allow the Cardinals to deploy them in a number of ways on the perimeter . They can lock up slot receivers when opponents trot out `` 11 '' personnel ( one running back , one tight end and three receivers ) against the base defense , or they can shadow tight ends when opponents align them out wide in spread sets . Mathieu 's athleticism and versatility provide [ defensive coordinator James Bettcher ] with a hybrid defender who can snuff out the ultra-athletic tight ends taking the NFL by storm .
Arizona has no shortage of talented defenders . Patrick Peterson is among the NFL 's top cornerbacks , defensive end Calais Campbell is coming off their second straight Pro Bowl and the defensive line should improve following the offseason additions of Robert Nkemdiche and Chandler Jones .
Guitar Practice Tips
Hi , I 'm Matthias . Learning the physical mechanics of how to play the guitar is one thing , but how to practice once you understand that is something completely different . If you 're not taking guitar lessons from a well-qualified instructor , the chances are that you 're not practicing right . My job as a teacher is n't just to help you play guitar , it 's to help you learn how to practice .
And what should you practice ? Scales , chords , arpeggios , songs ? And how much time should you devote to each ? What techniques are important ? I 'll be discussing several practice tips that will help you to become not just a better guitarist , but a better musician .
Get It Right the First Time
One reason you might find yourself playing the same thing over and over again , is that you played it wrong the first time , and now you 're constantly correcting mistakes . This problem is fairly easy to avoid , but you have to be very disciplined in order to do so .
So how do you play something that 's brand new…perfectly ? Slow down . But before you even play , consider what you 're about to play . How long is the passage ? If it 's longer than your attention span , then you should shorten it . When you 're looking at the notation or tab , can you clearly visualize your hand position and finger placement for each note ? If not , go through and make notes as to neck position , string numbers , finger numbers , picking direction ; any information that will help you to play it right the first time .
Challenge Yourself But Be Realistic
Playing a challenging piece of music can be very rewarding , but it can also be very frustrating . Beginners repeat this problem again and again—trying to play something that is much too difficult . This is a simple fix . Avoid music that 's too difficult . A man 's got ta know their limitations . So learn the easy stuff . Now that does n't mean go play Mary Had a Little Lamb ; what it does mean is focus on the basic skills to play guitar well and make it sound good .
If you 're taking guitar lessons , your instructor should be able to take more advanced music that you want to learn and simplify it for your current technical level . It 's just another reason why having a teacher is so important .
Stay Regular
Just like cramming for a test in school , cramming your practice time does n't work either . You might retain enough to pass the test , but you did n't really learn it . Playing the guitar is no different . Playing a musical instrument exercises both the mind and body . Your practice time needs to be spaced out during the times of day when your mind is fresh . Practicing when you can barely keep your eyes open is worthless .
The Athletic Guitarist
The physical aspects of playing guitar are very athletic . Just like exercising , it 's important to be aware of your muscles , and what tension and pain there might be when playing . Exercising just once a week puts strain on the body and you do n't feel any better . Exercising several times a week has great advantages . Playing the guitar is no different . Feeling strain and tension means that you are either pushing your technical limitations or you 're doing something unhealthy . Be sure to take regular breaks and let your muscles recuperate .
Do Not Set a Timer
When practicing , there are lots of different things to cover , so it 's best to just allow a certain amount of time for each . Right ? No . If something needs more attention , then give it more attention . If something does n't , then playing it over and over is a waste of time .
Use Your Metronome
Your metronome is one of the best practicing tools you have . I can not stress enough the importance of playing with correct rhythm . If you play a correct note at the wrong point in time , it 's not correct . If you want to play with other musicians , rhythm is crucial .
Practicing with your metronome can also keep you from playing too fast , which can lead to sloppy guitar playing .
Practicing vs . Playing
This concept is critical—if you 're playing a song or exercise over and over again , hoping that your mistakes will magically disappear , you 're not practicing . Practicing is focusing on something very specific . It could be a chord change , a position shift , an awkward chord , scale , or arpeggio fingering . But practicing is not mindlessly playing the same thing over and over . Keep your focus and your playing will improve drastically .
Conclusion
These are just a few tips to help you develop good practicing habits . And the whole point of practicing properly is to make learning music easier and to become a better guitarist .

New Delhi : John Chambers , 67 , executive chairperson of Cisco Systems Inc. , has been a long-time supporter of India and an admirer of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who , they say , gets it when it comes to creating a digital country . Chambers was in India to announce the creation of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum ( USISPF ) which they say will take the relationship between the two countries , their companies , and their people , to the next level . The body was created after the existing team of the US India Business Council decided to leave , and the body 's parent , the US Chambers of Commerce decided to merge USIBC with itself . In an interview , Chambers spoke about the new body , India , Prime Minister Modi . Edited excerpts :
Tell us about this new body you are creating . How is it going to be different from existing bodies ?
It is different in every way . It is focused on future and it is completely independent . It has 100 % focus on the next major technology business societal shift . So , it is really thinking about where we want to be 10-20 years from today and we thought about it and we realised this ca n't be an evolution . Every major company knows that they are at an inflection . That is why I like your prime minster so much because they do so much of it so well . They set a goal . They outline a vision that gives people hope . That 's why we were so excited about what we can do with this kind of organization structure .
It is company to government ; company to their customers ; customers could be consumers or business . It could be companies to start-ups ; start-ups together with common goals .
We see the potential of what next generation strategic partnerships can be . Not on trade but more importantly on the society , economic growth , job creation , inclusion , innovation and a new generation of entrepreneurship ; if we do this right between our two nations , I think it will not only have major economic impact on the citizens of both nations in a very positive way but it will be a model for others .
At a transactional level , this will also guide US companies that want to do business in India and Indian companies that want to do business in the US ?
It very much could . They tend to trust us . The governments seem to trust us . We have complete support from all the political leaders ( in both countries ) almost regardless of political parties .
You have been a regular visitor to India , and have been working closely with the government for the past few years . What changes do you see ?
Let me frame the whole context . Obviously , I am a huge believer in India and I love the country . I think India has some most advanced digital vision and strategy in the world . I see the Prime Minister as one of the top leaders that I have ever met in my life . They have got a vision and a strategy ; they know how to execute them for India 's 1.3 billion people . I think it has been remarkable progress .
When Prime Minister Modi was elected , I very quickly listened to them and decided to bet on India in a big way as I believed in their vision and strategy . They know how to form win-win partnerships that most people do n't . They are willing to take the risk that goes with it . Some people might be critical saying they have n't moved fast enough . They are moving faster than any leader in the world . ( For instance ) , without the Goods and Services Tax , companies firms are not going to invest here ; without it , you are never going to be a manufacturing powerhouse .
You would have said there is no way they would ( be able to ) do that , yet they have . I would give India an A in terms of progress over the last three years vs. an A+ for what people have thought of doing . But ... there is always room for improvement .
Any negatives ?
It surprised me , but India tends to be critical of itself and I think that faster people buy the vision and understand what 's possible ( the better ) . That 's how you move to a speed that is equal with others .
Do you think it is easier to do business in India now than it was before ?
Absolutely ! I could not manufacture in India three years ago ; ( it was ) not an option . I can now manufacture in India very effectively . We have opened our plants . Now , we have to see how do we get the efficiencies where we can use India as an export engine .
What are Cisco 's plans in India ?
India is our second headquarters . Every time we bet on India ... 1997 , we bet in a big way on India . We made it our second headquarters ; later we made it our Digitisation headquarters . 40 % of our engineering head count is of Indian ancestry .
Using H1-B visas to replace US workers with Indians a mistake : Cisco chairperson
So , we are very optimistic about India . India was our top country last year from the sales side . It is our great source in terms of talent and not labour arbitrage .
Finally , a question on culture . Cisco is a quintessential new economy company based on the West Coast . A lot of new economy start-ups are in trouble over how they are run , the kind of culture they have . You never had this kind of issues . So what did you do right and what are these people doing wrong ?
A couple of things . Every company will make mistakes and every company has bumps . But if you look at the role of the CEO , he/she only has four jobs : vision and strategy for the company , ( recruit and periodically change the ) management team to implement that vision and , ( to create a ) culture , and communicate all the above . And culture to me ... People say that culture eats vision ; I do n't buy that . I mean it 's one of the four elements but our culture—we put it on the badge ... culture is a huge part of who you are . The culture is what broke down Uber ... is often what either gets a company to be very successful or cause it to lag behind . I am very proud of ( Cisco 's ) culture .
I just made a set earlier this week , they 're toasty warm and awesome !
I used an old long sleeve t-shirt that I had n't worn in quite a while - the sleeves where long , but the torso was getting a bit short for me , and it was n't really stretching out long enough . There were some cool looking asian calligraphy on the arms , which added a nice touch . It was an old shirt I must have had for at least 12 years , real thick thermal weave fabric .
After I cut the sleeves to length , I unpinned them and used them as templates against the back of the shirt . My gracious girlfriend ran their sewing machine through the elbow-side ends ( sleeve characters on the inside ) , then ran it through all four layers of fabric for some extra toasty warmness . The inside liner would make adding things like pockets a bit easier , which I 'll probably add soon , or make another pair with a set of pockets installed before the final stitching-up .
Very Ninja ( though probably illegal in some areas ) additions could include fist packs inside the palms , leather and steel reinforcements over the back of the hand , steel studs across knuckles , pockets for throwing spikes or knives ...
More geeky additions could be some Arduino Lilypad accessories , like a custom wireless `` Power Glove '' with buttons , buttons , fingertip contact switches , accelerometers and gyroscopes to be used as a game controller ( which could also be used as a MIDI instrument ... You could turn a Tai Chi into an interactive music experience ... , or something just to run windows with something other than a mouse or trackpad - I HATE laptop trackpads and tend to use a PS2 controller rigged up as a mouse ) . Or it could just be used to measure punch velocity if you 're in boxing or martial arts training ... aww , now that sounds kinda rad . Installing a stealth audio or video recording devices is another very ninja , geeky application ...
Very cool project , very simple , yet you can endlessly tweak and add to the design to make something that is truly your own . Thanks for posting this !
Billionaire Joe Ricketts , who founded the company that owns the D.C. news blog DCist , shut the local site down after staffers pushed to unionize . ( Nati Harnik/AP )
Aaron Myers was furious when they heard that Joe Ricketts , the billionaire chief executive of the company that owns D.C. local news blog DCist , had abruptly shuttered the site after employees voted to unionize . Myers , a 34-year-old Dallas native who has been active in D.C. 's jazz community since they moved here in 2008 , says they saw the move as an affront to the community .
So they bought the DCistNow.com domain name and on Monday launched a local news blog of their own .
In the site 's introductory post , they were critical of Ricketts 's decision to close DCist , and they described their site as an effort to fill the void . They hope to recruit DCist 's former reporters to write for their new site and eventually pay them as freelancers .
“ It was ( and is ) my goal to have a community resource ( blog ) that is based in DC , that will be a consistent source of quality information filled with innovation , integrity , and that same investigative spirit that I believe the DCist and many other blogs possess , ” Myers wrote . “ I do not take kindly to outsiders trying to disrupt my home . ”
Ricketts does not appear to have the same enthusiasm for Myers 's idea . On Wednesday Partridge Partners , an intellectual property law firm representing DCist 's parent firm DNAinfo , contacted Myers requesting that they cease and desist .
[ Gothamist local news network , including DCist and DNAinfo , abrupty shut down . ]
In a Nov. 8 letter reviewed by The Washington Post , the firm admonished Myers against “ adopting any name or mark that is composed of the components “ DC ” and “ IST ” in any form or combination . ”
“ DNAinfo has acquired substantial goodwill in its DCIST trademark and actively promotes that goodwill , ” the letter reads . “ Your use of the Domain Name and ‘ DCist Now ' is anticipated to cause confusion , mistake and deception with DNAinfo and its DCIST name and mark in violation of U.S. trademark law . ”
The letter said Myers 's blog may also violate the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act , a 1999 law that concerns deceptive domain names . The firm said Myers may be liable for $ 100,000 in damages not including attorneys ' fees .
In an emailed statement to the Washington Post , a spokesperson representing DNAinfo described the letter as an effort to protect the company 's intellectual property .
“ We think it 's great that other people want to start neighborhood news sites but this is our intellectual property and we will protect it , ” a DNAinfo spokesperson said .
[ Read billionaire Joe Ricketts ' cease and desist letter ]
Asked Wednesday how they would respond , Myers said they would refuse to transfer the website to DNAinfo .
Ricketts “ can do what they want . . . there ai n't much they can take from me , ” Myers said in an interview Wednesday . “ I do n't care how much money they have , we 're gon na stand up for the people of D.C . ”
They later added via a text : “ They will NOT be getting DCistNOW . ”
Myers said they contacted Ricketts 's company on Monday asking whether there is a bidding process for the DCist website and archive , but says they received no response .
On Wednesday , the site displayed a hodgepodge of introductory posts in the style of a local news and culture blog : a post about a local jazz musician , a frozen yogurt review and a link to The Post 's 2017 Virginia election coverage .
Myers says they want to turn the blog into an independent , profitable business . They described the staff as “ a volunteer force , for now . ”
Myers says they moved to the District in 2008 after three years in the Army , an unsuccessful mayoral run in a small town in Texas and some time in California . They work as a jazz singer at a bar in the District 's Eastern Market neighborhood and also runs a nonprofit meant to support the city 's jazz community .
This story has been updated to reflect the correct job title of Joe Ricketts , and to include subsequent comment from DNAinfo .
Bloodhound SSC as seen during its international debut expo at Canary Wharf , London in September 2015
Bloodhound SSC is a British supersonic land vehicle . Its goal is to match or exceed 1,000 miles per hour ( 1,609 km/h ) , achieving a new world land speed record . [ 1 ] The pencil-shaped car , powered by a jet engine and a rocket engine , is designed to reach 1,050 miles per hour ( 1,690 km/h ) . [ 2 ] It is being developed and built with the intention of breaking the land speed record by 33 per cent , the largest ever margin . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Runway testing of up to 200 miles per hour ( 320 km/h ) occurred on 26 , 28 and 30 October 2017 in Newquay , Cornwall . Bloodhound SSC will then be tested on the Hakskeen Pan in the Mier area of the Northern Cape , South Africa , where a track 12 miles ( 19 km ) long , 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) wide has been cleared . [ 5 ]
In July 2016 , it was reported that Andy Green would pilot the Bloodhound and attempt to break their own World Land Speed Record . [ 6 ] In May 2018 , the team announced plans to make a 500 mph run in 2019 , and a 1,000 mph runs in 2020 . [ 7 ]
Development [ edit ]
The project was announced on 23 October 2008 at the Science Museum in London by Lord Drayson - then Minister of Science in the UK 's Department for Innovation , Universities and Skills - who in 2006 first proposed the project to Land Speed Record holders Richard Noble and Wing Commander and RAF pilot Andy Green . The two men , between them , have held the land speed record since 1983 .
In 1983 , Noble , a self-described engineer , adventurer , and former paint salesperson , [ 8 ] reached 633 mph ( 1,019 km/h ) driving a turbojet-powered car named Thrust2 across the Nevada desert . In 1997 , they headed the project to build the ThrustSSC , which was driven by Andy Green at 763 mph ( 1,228 km/h ) , thereby breaking the sound barrier , a record first for a land vehicle ( in compliance with Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile rules ) . The project was named for the Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missile . [ 9 ]
Andy Green is also Bloodhound 's intended driver . Bloodhound is planned to accelerate from 0 to 1,000 mph ( 0 to 1,609 km/h ) in 42 seconds , and decelerate using airbrakes at 800 mph ( 1,300 km/h ) , parachutes at 600mph ( 965km/h ) and disc brakes below 250 mph ( 400 km/h ) . The force on the driver during acceleration would be 2.5g ( two-and-a-half times their body weight ) and during deceleration , up to 3g .
The project was originally fully based in the former Maritime Heritage Centre on the Bristol harbourside , next to Brunel 's SS Great Britain . The construction would remain in Bristol but the head offices of the project moved to Didcot in Oxfordshire in late 2015 . [ 10 ]
Project ownership [ edit ]
Development stalled in October 2018 when it was announced that the company backing the project , Bloodhound Programme Ltd. , had gone into administration , leaving a funding gap of £25 million , which put the venture 's future into question . [ 11 ]
The project was termed `` axed '' in December 2018 , with plans to return or sell assets , [ 12 ] but in the same month Yorkshire entrepreneur Ian Warhurst stepped in to rescue the project by buying the company for an undisclosed sum . [ 13 ]
Design [ edit ]
Cockpit
Aerodynamics [ edit ]
The College of Engineering at Swansea University has been heavily involved in the aerodynamic shape of the vehicle from the start . Professor Oubay Hassan , Professor Ken Morgan and their team have used Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) [ 14 ] [ 15 ] to provide an understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics of the proposed shape , at all speeds , including predicting the likely vertical , lateral and drag forces on the vehicle and its pitch and yaw stability . [ 16 ] This technology , originally developed for the aerospace industry , was validated for a land-going vehicle during the design of ThrustSSC . It was this involvement with the previous land speed record that prompted Richard Noble to approach Swansea in April 2007 for their help with this latest challenge . Swansea University 's School of the Environment and Society was also enlisted to help determine a new test site for the record as the test site for the ThrustSSC record attempt had become unsuitable . [ 17 ]
Propulsion [ edit ]
A prototype Eurojet EJ200 jet engine developed for the Eurofighter and bound for a museum , was donated to the project . This would take the car to 300 mph ( 480 km/h ) , after which a bespoke hybrid rocket designed by Nammo would boost the car up to 1,000 miles per hour ( 1,609 km/h ) . A third engine , a Jaguar supercharged V-8 , was to be used as an auxiliary power unit and to drive the oxidizer pump for the rocket . [ 18 ]
Development testing of the initial Bloodhound SSC hybrid rocket motor was conducted by Daniel Jubb [ 19 ] of The Falcon Project with tests conducted in 2008-2013 . Publicly disclosed tests were conducted in 2009 [ 20 ] and 2012 [ 21 ] [ 22 ] including a run at Newquay Airport in GB . [ 23 ] In addition Daniel Jubb [ 24 ] designed , manufactured and test fired a full diameter 18 '' monopropellant HTP thruster [ 25 ] for the subsonic ground tests for Bloodhound SSC . `` The Bloodhound team had been developing its own hybrid power unit in collaboration with Manchester based Falcon Project Ltd , and gave this rocket its first UK test firing in October 2012 . And although this demonstration was deemed a success at the time , it became clear that considerable sums of money and time would be needed to perfect the design . '' `` Nammo will have test firings next year in Raufoss and when we get the data off those we can decide on precisely what the packaging requirements will be , '' said Mr Chapman , Bloodhound 's chief engineer [ 26 ]
The Nammo hybrid rocket was to be fuelled by solid hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene and liquid high-test peroxide oxidiser .
In order to accelerate the car to 800mph , the monopropellant rocket would produce around 40kN ( 8992 lbf ) of thrust and the EJ200 jet engine make 90kN ( 20,232 lbf ) in reheat . For the 1,000mph runs , the Nammo hybrid rockets would provide a thrust of 123.75kN ( 27,820 lbf ) , generating about 212kN ( 47,659 lbf ) in total . [ 27 ]
Wheels [ edit ]
The four 36-inch ( 910 mm ) diameter wheels would rotate at up to 10,200 rpm and be forged from an aluminum zinc alloy [ 28 ] to resist the 50,000 g centrifugal forces . [ 29 ]
Construction [ edit ]
Engineers produced the scale model which was exhibited at the launch , and integrated the engineering behind the car into its curriculum , working with design team , led by Chief Engineer Mark Chapman . The car was to be built at a site in Bristol . [ 30 ] The site was to include an educational centre . [ 31 ] A full scale model was unveiled at the 2010 Farnborough International Airshow , [ 32 ] when it was announced that Hampson Industries would begin to build the rear chassis section of the car in the first quarter of 2011 and that a deal for the manufacture of the front of the car was due . Chief Engineer Mark Chapman says , `` We aim to shake down the vehicle on a runway in the UK at the beginning of 2013 . '' This plan was delayed via lack of funding but by October 2017 full reheat static testing had been undertaken with the jet engine at Cornwall Airport Newquay prior to the start of low speed test runs . [ 33 ]
As of October 2018 , the car 's principal structure had been built , as well as the track it was intended to run on . [ 11 ]
Education and STEM outreach [ edit ]
The Bloodhound Project had an education component designed to inspire future generations to take up careers in science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) by showcasing these subjects and interacting with young people and students . [ 34 ] The offices of Bloodhound Company were moved to UTC Oxfordshire in Didcot in 2016 to improve this link with education . [ 35 ]

For a while now , I 've been demonstrating Visio automation in PowerShell . For the most part , the posts have included a bunch of short code snippets designed to illustrate simple concepts .
Unfortunately , the code has been filled with “ magic ” constants , and lots of method calls on the various Visio COM objects . Both of those make code hard to read and write , the exact opposite of what you want as a PowerShell scripter . What 's the solution ? PowerShell makes it easy to wrap complex code in cmdlets ( or advanced functions , if you prefer ) and expose a much simpler interface .
Background
When I started looking at driving Visio from PowerShell , I ran across the VisioAutomation project ( originally here ) by Saveen Reddy . Contained in that project ( which is much broader in scope than my interests ) was a module called VisioPS that exposed several Visio concepts as PowerShell cmdlets . I played with it some , and it worked . That was exciting . A major downside for me was that the module was a binary module , which meant writing cmdlets in C # . That 's a great approach for the project , which is geared towards .NET languages in general , but it limits the attractiveness for PowerShell developers ( or at least for me ) . I ended up re-writing parts of the module in PowerShell and decided eventually to write my own module . There are probably some naming artifacts left over from its origin as a “ re-implementation ” of VisioPS . I wanted to make sure to give credit for getting me started down this road .
What is VisioBot3000 ?
To start with , VisioBot3000 implements cmdlets to help you draw Visio diagrams using the things that I 've introduced over the last several posts :
Documents
Pages
Stencils
Masters
Shapes
Containers
Connectors
It also has some support ( barely ) for Layers .
Here 's a simple ( annotated ) example of using VisioBot3000 . It uses a custom stencil that I have on my system ( and a stock stencil that I copied to c : \temp ) , but that 's not terribly important :
Import-Module VisioBot3000 -Force # start Visio and create a new document New-VisioApplication New-VisioDocument C : \temp\TestVisioPrimitives.vsdx # tell Visio what Stencils I want to use and give them `` nicknames '' Register-VisioStencil -Name Containers -Path C : \temp\MyContainers.vssx Register-VisioStencil -Name Servers -Path C : \temp\SERVER_U.vssx # pick a master from one of those stencils and give it a nickname Register-VisioShape -Name WebServer -From Servers -MasterName 'Web Server ' Register-VisioShape -Name DBServer -From Servers -MasterName 'Database Server ' # pick another master ( this time a container ) and give it a nickname # note that this is a different cmdlet Register-VisioContainer -Name Domain -From Containers -MasterName 'Domain ' # draw a container with two items in it New-VisioContainer -shape ( get-visioshape Domain ) -name MyDomain -contents { New-VisioShape -master WebServer -name PrimaryServer -x 5 -y 5 New-VisioShape -master DBServer -Name SQL01 -x 5 -y 7 } # add a connector New-VisioConnector -from PrimaryServer -to SQL01 -name SQL -color Red -Arrow
That probably seems like a lot of code , but it 's a lot less than you 'd have to write to draw the diagram . A lot of it is boilerplate code that you 'd probably factor out into a “ standard diagram stencils and masters script ” . And look….the only “ magic numbers ” in the code are the x/y positions . Not super bad , in my opinion .
Here 's the output :
This code is a huge ( yuge ? ) improvement over writing code against the bare COM objects . But it 's not even close to the best part of VisioBot3000 .
Did you notice that the title said “ Clark Kent ” ? Stay tuned until next time when VisioBot3000 takes of its glasses , so to speak , and the power is really revealed .
As usual , let me know what you think in the comments ( or on Reddit , or Google+ , or Twitter )

Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) will be a major thorn in Mitch McConnell 's side after it was announced that they have been promoted to the position of ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee .
The promotion is big for Sen. Sanders , and it also means that they are going to have a high profile seat from which to launch their 2016 challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination .
In a statement , Sanders made it clear that they are going to be battling the Koch billionaires , Wall Street , and bringing attention to the growing problem of income inequality , “ I want to thank Sen. Reid and the Democratic caucus for the opportunity to serve as the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee . At a time when the middle class is disappearing and the gap between the rich and everybody else is growing wider , we need a budget which reflects the needs of working families and not Wall Street and the top 1 percent . I look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans on the committee to craft a budget that is fair to all Americans , not just the powerful special interests . ”
Sanders has already announced that they will be voting against the government funding bill that the Senate is currently debating , but from their leadership position on the Budget Committee , the Vermont Independent will have the power to give a voice to the 99 % of Americans who are n't wealthy enough to buy access to our political leaders with campaign contributions .
The fact that Sen. Sanders has been promoted to such an important position is another sign of the growing power of liberals within the Senate Democratic caucus . Bernie Sanders will now be in a position to be a major pain in the neck to the Koch brothers and the Republicans that they fund .
Democrats may have lost their Senate majority , but the promotion of Bernie Sanders is another sign that the left is gearing up for a fight .

Tottenham Hotspur are confident they will agree a new contract with Toby Alderweireld long before a potential £25million release clause can be triggered .
A report from the ‘ Football Leaks ' website stating that there is a £25m release clause in Alderweireld 's contract prompted an almost instant denial from Spurs .
Telegraph Sport understands that the clause is only active in the summer of 2019 if Tottenham take up a one year option and extend their deal to 2020 . Alderweireld 's contract also states that any transfer would have to be completed at least 14 days before the closure of that summer 's transfer window .
Spurs have refused to comment further on the matter and only reiterated the fact there is no active clause in Alderweireld '' s contract in its present form .
Even though the clause is of little immediate concern , Tottenham are aiming to add Alderweireld to the list of players to sign a new contract and the club will take out the one-year option that includes the £25m buy-out .
Manager Mauricio Pochettino insisted they did not know the exact terms of Alderweireld 's contract , but did not seem worried by the situation . “ I do n't know the details of their contract , ” said Pochettino .
ARCADIA , Calif. ( AP ) —brought their humor to the announcing booth on Friday at Santa Anita , calling a race that likely left fans wondering exactly which horse had won .
The late night comic took over from veteran caller Trevor Denman for the second race . O'Brien did n't have to pronounce any tongue twisters among the six horses running a mile on the dirt . They even smoothly handled the favorite 's name , Sarangani .
That was the easy part .
Squinting through binoculars to describe what was unfolding proved much tougher in a sport that has its own unique lingo .
“ I 'm seeing a bunch of horses following Blue Collar Boy , ” O'Brien shouted . “ All horses look alike when you 're not around horses a lot . ”
They described the starting gate as “ the white thing . ”
Later , they breathlessly told the crowd , “ I 'm not seeing too well because my eyelashes are up against the binoculars and it 's blocking my view . ”
O'Brien admitted that they were thoroughly confused trying to identify the horses by the color of the jockeys ' silks or “ costumes , ” as they called them .
“ If you 're going to have idiot celebrities come in and call a race , you ca n't have two guys in all blue and two guys in all white , ” they said . “ It 's not fair . ”
O'Brien said they had prepared by memorizing the numbers on the horses ' saddle cloths . Denman told them minutes before the race that is n't how it 's done .
“ I had to completely forget everything , ” they said . “ It 's like being told seconds before the SAT that it 's going to be in German . I was horrified . ”
O'Brien also got thrown for a loop when they were informed that their call would be broadcast overseas to tracks that carry Santa Anita 's races , including Britain .
“ We 've angered them again , ” they joked . “ They 're already mad about the NSA ( National Security Agency ) and now they 're mad about this . ”
During the race they told the crowd , “ The jockeys ' bottoms are in the air , which is the way that jockeys ride horses . Bottoms high , that 's the way to go , boys . ”
They taped the bit to air later on their TBS show , “ Conan . ”
Denman had their small booth overtaken by O'Brien 's camera crew , and after they departed , they straightened a picture on the wall that had been knocked askew .
“ It 's unique , ” they said of O'Brien 's performance . “ You will never , ever get any race call like that in the history of horse racing . ”
It was an exciting two-horse race to the finish line , with Knucklebuster beating Blue Collar Boy by a half-length . They paid $ 18 for a $ 2 win bet .
A member of O'Brien 's crew said they held two winning tickets on the race , and figured they were worth about $ 280 .

Patrick Muhayirwa was trapped in an ambush while patrolling to protect gorillas in Africa 's oldest national park
A 26-year-old wildlife ranger has been gunned down by militia operating in the Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
According to park authorities , Patrick Prince Muhayirwa was part of a group of rangers and DRC army personnel patrolling the huge park to prevent poaching .
Virunga is home to about a quarter of the world 's critically endangered mountain gorillas , which poachers target for bushmeat . The elephant population in the park has plummeted to less than 400 .
On Wednesday , when the group reached the shores of Lake Edward , near the Ugandan border , they were ambushed from the front and the back by what witnesses described as members of the Mai Mai militia . Muhayirwa was killed in the ensuing gunfight . They had only recently joined the rangers service , which is tasked with protecting the the park .

“ Ranger Muhayirwa was a young and highly-dedicated ranger and the park is in deep mourning for their loss , ” said park director Emmanuel de Merode in a statement . “ We wish to extend our sincerest condolences to their family . Their death is a tragic loss for Virunga national park , and we are ever grateful for their service to their country . ”
Another ranger , Fikos Kavedo , who survived the ambush with a bullet wound to the leg killed two rebels before escaping the scene . They are currently receiving treatment .
Muhayirwa 's death continues a pattern of ambushes of rangers within the park . In March , two rangers were killed in the line of duty while a third was reported missing during an attack also credited to the Mai Mai militia . To date , more than 150 rangers have died in service to Virunga national park .
Worldwide , more than 100 rangers die every year , according to Sean Willmore , the president of the International Ranger Federation and the Thin Green Line Foundation , in an opinion piece for the Guardian this week . “ Surely if a country lost 100 of their soldiers , each and every year , we would call it a war , ” they said .
In further violence this week , a journalist who had reported on illegal logging in Myanmar was found , apparently beaten to death , on the side of a highway on Tuesday .

Delivering on a promise they made in an essay for Sports Illustrated in which they revealed that they were gay , Wizards free-agent center Jason Collins marched in Boston 's annual pride parade on Saturday .
Wearing a black Nike shirt with rainbow lettering that read `` # BETRUE '' , Collins joined their former college roommate and current Massachusetts member of congress Joe Kennedy at the event , which drew thousands of attendees and is in its 43rd year . WCBV.com reported that Boston 's parade drew 230 groups this year , making it the second-largest such event , trailing only New York City .
“ I 'm a 34-year-old NBA center , ” Collins wrote in an April piece with Franz Lidz . “ I 'm black . And I 'm gay . I did n't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport . But since I am , I 'm happy to start the conversation . I wish I was n't the kid in the classroom raising their hand and saying , ‘ I 'm different . ' If I had my way , someone else would have already done this . Nobody has , which is why I 'm raising my hand . ”
With that declaration , Collins became the first active openly gay male athlete in the four major American sports leagues . They said Boston 's pride parade was a major impetus for their decision to reveal their sexuality .
I realized I needed to go public when Joe Kennedy , my old roommate at Stanford and now a Massachusetts member of congress , told me they had just marched in Boston 's 2012 Gay Pride Parade . I 'm seldom jealous of others , but hearing what Joe had done filled me with envy . I was proud of them for participating but angry that as a closeted gay man I could n't even cheer my straight friend on as a spectator . If I 'd been questioned , I would have concocted half truths . What a shame to have to lie at a celebration of pride . I want to do the right thing and not hide anymore . I want to march for tolerance , acceptance and understanding . I want to take a stand and say , `` Me , too . '' The recent Boston Marathon bombing reinforced the notion that I should n't wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect . Things can change in an instant , so why not live truthfully ? When I told Joe a few weeks ago that I was gay , they were grateful that I trusted him . They asked me to join them in 2013 . We 'll be marching on June 8 .

Collins , 34 , was a first-round pick in 2001 after spending four years at Stanford . Their 12-year NBA career has included stops with the Nets , Grizzlies , Timberwolves , Hawks , Celtics and Wizards . Collins ' twin brother , Jarron , retired in 2011 after a 10-year career with the Jazz , Suns , Clippers and Blazers .
Dustin Tokarski does n't seem to be bothered too much by the spotlight of the Stanley Cup Playoffs .
After some admittedly nervous play while making their NHL postseason debut in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Final , the 24-year-old backstopped the Carey Price-less Montreal Canadiens to an unlikely Game 3 victory at Madison Square Garden . The only signs of a nervous tick from Tokarski while making 35 saves in the 3-2 overtime win over the New York Rangers was on their mask .
That 's right , Tokarski has The Tick punching through the left side of a mask otherwise dominated by historic Habs imagery .
Painted by David Arrigo of Darrigo Art , Tokarski has included the comic book superhero bug on all five masks they have done together , including during their days with the Tampa Bay Lightning as a reference to their nickname , Tic .
Their Montreal mask , which Arrigo said was actually painted shortly after being traded to the Canadiens for Cedric Desjardins in February 2013 , also included the various team logos from over the years . The backplate features another Habs logo and a picture of their grandfather , with the word “ Guardian ” scrolled underneath , a tribute to their biggest supporter growing up .
Enjoy the close-up photos from Arrigo below , and for more great David Arrigo art – and there 's a lot more there than just masks as David has been commissioned to do live murals at the Olympics , NHL All-star Game , and Superbowl , among others – please visit their web site and follow them on Facebook and Twitter :

This fiscal cliff is making people do crazy things . Case in point , 81-year-old Representative Bill Young ( R-Fla. ) coming very close to caning a protester who wanted `` a commitment from them [ Young ] to extend the middle class tax cuts . '' Let 's face it : these Fiscal Cliff negotiations are boring ( there , we said it ) . But on a human level , they are inciting elected octogenarians to fight with men much younger than them . As it turns out , the Florida Consumer Action Network has been targeting Young over their position on taxes — Young , unlike President Obama , wants to protect the top two percent of earners in America — and had organized a protest for Monday night at Young 's office in Seminole , Florida . According to Michael Newberger over at Creative Loafing :
One particularly persistent activist loudly asked Young about their stances , getting into close proximity of the 81-year-old member of congress . It did not end well . Young grabbed the activist by the arm and raised their cane , largely looking like they were attempting to strike the protester until both were separated by the police officers present .
So yes , a caning in Florida ... over the fiscal cliff . Young , according to the SaintPetersBlog , is now considering legal action .

The Arizona Diamondbacks , trying to create payroll flexibility , are willing to trade catcher Miguel Montero , according to major-league sources .
Rival clubs say the D-Backs are shopping Montero . An Arizona official say the team is more in `` listening mode . '' Either way , the effect is the same .
The D-Backs would move Montero for the right offer , even though they lack an internal replacement and would need to acquire a catcher either through free agency or trade .
Article continues below ...
Stryker Trahan , the D-Backs ' No . 1 pick out of Lafayette ( La . ) H.S . in 2012 , has yet to play above Class A. Pete O'Brien , acquired from the Yankees last summer for Martin Prado , is a major power prospect , but raw defensively .
Montero , 31 , is owed $ 40 million over the next three seasons . And though their offense declined in 2013 and '14 , they still could be a realistic alternative for teams that strike out on free-agent catcher Russell Martin , particularly if the D-Backs help pay down their remaining obligation .
The D-Backs want to upgrade their starting pitching , but team president Derrick Hall told the Arizona Republic in September that the team 's payroll is expected to drop from an Opening Day figure of about $ 112 million last season to the $ 100 million range in 2015 .
The club already has $ 68.65 million in commitments for '15 , according to Cot 's Baseball Contracts â and that sum does not include raises in arbitration for left-hander Wade Miley , closer Addison Reed , outfielder Mark Trumbo and infielder Cliff Pennington .
Montero batted .243 last season with a .699 OPS , 13 home runs and 72 RBIs . They caught more innings than all but the Royals ' Salvador Perez and Brewers ' Jonathan Lucroy , and over the past four seasons leads all catchers in games played at the position .
Teams interested in Montero could view that accumulation as a warning sign , fearing they might wear down . Or perhaps teams would view Montero as a player who might benefit from additional rest now that they are in their 30s .
Defensively , Montero led all catchers last season in the increasingly valued art of pitch framing , according to Statcorner.com . They also threw out 24.8 percent of opposing base stealers , 14th among the 28 qualifying catchers .
The D-Backs , even if they do not move Montero , could be active traders this offseason . They continue to draw interest in their young middle infielders , Chris Owings and Didi Gregorius . Left-hander Wade Miley and center fielder A.J . Pollock also are popular trade targets , but the team is not interested in moving either , sources say .

At a Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda ( HALA ) Community Conversation in Wallingford last Wednesday , more than a hundred area residents showed up to participate . A few seemed there to rally behind HALA , but the majority opposed it . From my breakout session , I learned to park and urban tree canopy were two big concerns . Moreover , many seemed concerned that HALA would n't really provide affordability . Their concerns appear self contradictory :
Affordable housing and big parking garages do not play well together . For all tenants , even those who do not own cars , 15 % of rent goes to covering parking , raising the cost of rent by an average of $ 246 in 2013 , according to a Sightline Institute study of multi-family housing developments . This is because the monthly parking fees cover only a fraction of the cost of building underground parking .
. For all tenants , even those who do not own cars , , in 2013 , according to a Sightline Institute study of multi-family housing developments . This is because the monthly parking fees cover only a fraction of the cost of building underground parking . In a typical apartment building , 37 % of underground parking goes unused according to the same 2013 Sightline study .
according to the same 2013 Sightline study . Dense housing in the city prevents sprawl at the suburban fringe . While we can mourn every tree lost , we must also keep our eyes on the prize . The prize is a healthier city with fewer long distance commuters , more transit riders , and more trees in the outer reaches of the urban growth boundary where semi-pristine forests still exist .

Many low- and moderate-income people can not afford to own a single-family home anywhere in the metropolitan region . If moderate-income folks drive until they qualify , they often find they can not afford their commuting costs , which negates the affordability of their far-flung home . Transportation costs are an overlooked but crucial part of working people making ends meet .

. Transportation costs are an overlooked but crucial part of working people making ends meet . In Seattle , people can save on transportation costs thanks to the strongest transit network in the region and the densest web of jobs and amenities . The greenest thing a city can do is encourage denser land use and higher transit use to lower carbon footprints and take the strain to grow off the suburbs where carbon footprints are much higher .
So who is greener ? The apartment dweller who owns neither tree nor car or the homeowner who claims three trees and one car ? By carbon footprint , it 's not even close . The apartment dweller saves way more carbon by not owning a car than the homeowner does by owning a few trees . American Forests estimates the average car needs 110 to 120 trees to offset the carbon it will belch out in its lifetime . That 's because the average car emits almost 8,320 pounds of carbon per year while the average tree absorbs 910 pounds of CO2 in its lifetime .
. That 's because the average car emits almost 8,320 pounds of carbon per year while the average tree absorbs 910 pounds of CO2 in its lifetime . And Prius owners , you 're not getting off easy either because your more fuel efficient Prius still represents about 9,000 pounds of embodied carbon due to emissions from its production and distribution . So you will need a small grove of trees just to offset the embodied carbon of your vehicle . Hence , the carless human is still doing more to combat global warming than a couple trees in your urban neighborhood . Note the same goes for electric cars ; they signify several tons of embodied carbon , too .
So next time somebody tries to block HALA upzones because not enough trees , not enough parking , or not affordability , remind them of these facts .

The Mothman
On this Podcast we set our sights on some big game . A curious cryptid and modern horror story that came to be known by one name , The Mothman , Described as the twisted image of a man with huge wings and glowing red eyes . Witnesses have reported eerily similar encounters with the mysterious beast ever since the sightings began in 1966 . The sleepy West Virginia town of Point Pleasant had up to 100 eye witnesses , some claiming to have been terrifyingly stalked by the creature , raising an atmosphere of terror and paranoia . But the accumulating appearances for the Mothman ended in abrupt and tragic fashion as on December 15th , 1967 the shocked townspeople saw the local Silver Bridge collapse into the Ohio river , taking 46 lives with it .
Paranormal prophecies and alien encounters
Soon after the disaster the talk began to move to the idea that the Mothman was a paranormal entity whose sudden appearance and just as sudden disappearance was inextricably linked to the bridge collapse . A creature of prophecy that came to tell of the impending doom .
Those that had encountered the creature were left with red eyes and other unexplained sicknesses .
But it was the parallel rash of UFO sightings in the area that presented an alternative theory . Towns folk had stories of lights in the sky , strange phone calls , full blown UFO and alien encounters , and even cryptic visits from unsettling ‘ men in black ' .
The Theories
Some people see a supernatural edge to the creature . Tales of the Native American Thunderbird or the Hindu Garuda , or any other numerous fables of angels and demons . Others consider it of advanced technological or extra terrestrial origin . A winged exo-suit , alien creature or superdimensional being existing in different realms . And some believe environmental factors are the cause for the genesis of the creature , or even the very sightings . Fingers pointed firmly at the local abandoned munitions works and it 's masses of toxic waste mutating an abomination of nature . Or classic mass hysteria , witness contamination , fabrications and good old fashioned moonshine .
We 'll cover all these factors , the science and hearsay , Indrid Cold , Richard Gere , John Keel and we 'll follow every track on our hunt for the mercurial Mothman .
POLICE Scotland has criticised the BBC after the broadcaster warned tourists off visiting Skye .
The corporation claimed the island 's annual Highland games had left the tourist hotspot ram-packed , and that police were telling visitors without accommodation to stay away .
But yesterday the force said the Beeb had gone too far , and that they were only asking those contemplating a trip over the sea to Skye to use some common sense.In an article online , the BBC had written : “ Skye is bursting at the seams . So much so that Police Scotland has advised visitors to stay away from the island unless they have a reservation . ”
Police Scotland said they would never issue advice like this .
Sergeant Bruce Crawford said : “ The summer months are an incredibly busy period on Skye and this is obviously good for business but it can create problems , especially with accommodation often at a premium . I would never advise people against visiting our beautiful island but I would ask people to use common sense before travelling without booking accommodation in advance if they intend to stay overnight . ”
The island cop said dozy tourists who found themselves without a bed for the night would often knock on their door asking their officers to “ phone round hotels and B & Bs to try and find them accommodation ” .
They added : “ Like everyone else we want visitors to have the best experience possible but I would encourage people , who travel from around the world to see Skye , to plan ahead unless they want to spend a night in their car . ”
Paul Wood , from the West Highland Free Press , criticised the BBC 's story .
Writing on Twitter they said : “ This kind of sensationalism will do the island no favours at all .
“ Skye does not have too many tourists .
“ People visiting Skye is a good thing , and as we 've reported ad nauseam , it 's underinvested infrastructure at the root of current problems . ”
Recently , one local business person called for a “ tourist tax ” to help pay for that infrastructure .
Though others on the island , including Shirley Spear from The Three Chimneys restaurant , dismissed the call , saying it was for local and central government to step up .
Andrew Martin , the director of the Scottish Centre of Tourism at Robert Gordon 's University , said tourism remained very important and very positive for Skye and for Scotland as a whole , but that the industry desperately needed to be thinking more long term .
“ Tourism refreshes parts of Scotland that other industries ca n't reach . That 's still fair for the Highlands and the islands , ” the academic told The National .
“ What we need for 2017 , 18 , 19 , and so on is a sustainable tourism industry . That means an industry that is high quality that we 're not going to wear out . ”
They added that unless more was done to protect the “ pinch points ” where there were huge amounts of tourists , and no adequate resources , it could start to have a detrimental effect on the industry .
“ My fear is that if people coming here are having a less than optimal experience then the word of mouth is going to be lost . ”
The island , long popular with tourists , has recently featured in Holywood blockbusters including The BFG , Prometheus and Michael Fassbender 's Macbeth , as well as in a recent Harry Styles music video .
This month experts believe the population of 10,000 will soar to more than 70,000 .
Previously , Ian Blackford , SNP leader at Westminster and the MP for Ross , Skye , and Lochaber , said : “ The sheer numbers who come on to the island can stretch the resources available . Something must be done to help cater for both locals and tourists in easing the burden on the infrastructure . ”
To say that Eric Gordon was struggling to start the season would be an understatement . Then , just as they were starting to play decent , they suffered a painful injury that threatened to keep them out for the rest of the year if they opted for surgery . Courageously , however , Gordon decided to rehab their shoulder and attempt to play through it . Even the mediocre version of Gordon would have been an upgrade over Austin Rivers , who had an especially bad stretch once Gordon went out . But then something surprising happened as Gordon returned in January . Not only has Gordon been passable upon their return , but they have been good . Really good .
Gordon is putting up 15.3 points , 4.8 assists , and 3.3 rebounds in just under 35 minutes per game . They are shooting 46.3 % from the field and 40.4 % from three . They are creating offense for themselves and others . Nearly 80 % of their 2-point field goal makes have been unassisted and their mid-range shot has been money ( 67 % since return ) . And when they are being set up , they are knocking down their shots too , as evidenced by their 51.5 % shooting from three in catch-and-shoot situations since their return , which is far better than the 34 % they were shooting prior to getting injured . They are shooting 47.4 % on wide open threes since returning , again way up from the 30 % they were shooting prior to injury .
Perhaps the most important change in Gordon has been their ability to maintain their high level of play throughout the entire game . Over the course of the last few years , we have seen several games where Gordon looked great in the first half but disappeared in the 2nd half . In this stretch , however , they are actually shooting a higher FG % in the second half of games . In fact , in 3rd quarters , they are averaging 10 minutes and is shooting 54.8 % from the field .
And in the 4th quarter , Gordon has become more of a facilitator , averaging around 2 assists in that quarter despite playing just 8 minutes . They also have their lowest turnover rate in that quarter . Since Gordon 's return , they have a 13:1 assist to turnover ratio in the 4th quarter , which is nothing short of remarkable . The key to their productivity seems to be the fact that they are playing on the ball more , as opposed to them just sitting in the corner and being a decoy like they were early in the season . They are setting the tone early by knocking down their jumper , then getting to the hole in the 3rd and setting up their teammates in the 4th while taking care of the ball .
Effectively , since return , Eric Gordon has been a slightly better version of what Aaron Afflalo or Bradley Beal has been this season . They have been more of a playmaker , as evidenced by the fact that they have 3 or more assists in every game since their return . In the 12 games prior to their injury , they failed to reach that threshold 8 times . And quite frankly , the Pelicans playoff hopes would have already been buried if Gordon did n't come back and play this well . They were n't getting anything from Rivers or Fredette in their absence , and the Toronto and Minnesota games would have likely been losses without him , and perhaps the Memphis game too .
With Jrue Holiday likely out until the All-Star break , Eric Gordon 's recent play gives the team hope that they can remain in that playoff picture as they anxiously await their return . They have given the Pelicans another creator to help out Tyreke Evans and their defense is also better than anything the other guards on the bench could give them . And not only does their recent play give the Pelicans hope for the upcoming stretch , but it is easy to envision a consistent and impressive offense once Holiday comes back if Monty staggers their three high usage guards properly .
Gordon finally has their confidence back and they have a clear role as well . By all accounts , Tyreke will move to the bench once Holiday returns , and Gordon 's role as a secondary creator will continue for the rest of the season . If that is in fact the case , and if Ryan Anderson could break out of their road slump , then the Pelicans can be an incredibly dangerous team over the second half of the season that has a chance to make some noise in the loaded Western Conference .
Two years ago , GDC 2013 's Experimental Gameplay Workshop featured a game that had the crowd cheering and applauding in delight . It was Ben Esposito ( The Unfinished Swan ) with Kachina . This year 's GDC revived an old favourite of the show , the Failure Workshop . This was a chance for developers to share the stories of their disasters , and the good or bad that came from them . And during it , Esposito generously and honestly told an engrossing and humbling tale of how Kachina became Donut County [ official site ] , and the hard cultural lessons they learned along the way .
Kachina , as presented at GDC 13 , was a beautiful and completely novel puzzle game , in which you played a hole in the ground . By sliding the hole around the ground , you could place it under objects smaller than its circumference , and they would fall in . As the hole consumed , it grew in size , letting you gobble up larger and larger objects , from trees to buildings to mountains . Esposito then demonstrated other mechanics that allowed wonderful interactions , spitting objects back out of the hole to solve puzzles , manipulate environments , and generally look incredibly lovely and cheerful . It also had a vaguely Native American vibe to it : totem poles , carved figurines , that sort of thing . The reasons did n't come up .
It turns out the reasons were inspired by Esposito 's having taken a fondness to doll-sculptures he 'd seen created by the Hopi . Intrigued by their design , and a desire to incorporate this style into the game , they wrote on their game 's website that the project was , “ Drawing from Hopi folklore. ” A sentence that would come to embarrass him , after an awkward journey .
“ There 's no such thing as Hopi folklore , ” they told a packed crowd at this week 's session . “ It 's a religion . It 's not cool to be ‘ drawing ' from that. ” They further explained that the depth of their research into the topic had been , well , liking the look of those dolls . But at that point , it was the design of their game , it looked good , and they were happy . And then they got sent a link to a blog post .
A teacher , writing for an educational website , American Indians In Children 's Literature , had written a short post explaining why they were disappointed by what she 'd seen of Kachina , and that it was being funded by The Indie Fund . A calm , pleasantly worded article , not calling for bans , but rather expressing a disappointment that it was , in their opinion , having a negative impact on the efforts to educate people about native US cultures . They observed that teepees and totem poles had nothing to do with the Hopi , and explained to Esposito that they were disappointed that their game might be unhelpful .
Esposito explained that they had the worst possible reaction . “ I decided to prove them wrong . I would make the most authentic game . It would be heroic… I am quite embarrassed about this . ”
To do this , Esposito began research . They bought books . They read about the Hopi , their stories and legends , and began working on making them be part of their game . Their player character , a young girl of Hopi descent , would be exploring their own heritage , learning about it as the player did too , taught by Esposito through their game . Hopi dolls would guide them on their journey , and the story of the erasure of the Hopi people would be told , authentically , educationally…
To illustrate how far off their original plan the game had become , Esposito showed a series of screenshots showing some frankly awful ideas . A sequence in which your hole would be responsible for burning down reservations , and then to build houses all over the site . Teeth-clawing . And somehow there was also to be a smelling mechanic – your hole could detect smells , then seek their source , and , er , yeah .
“ I was so far out in the weeds , ” said the developer . “ I did n't know enough about what I was talking about . I started asking people for help. ” People like professors of indigenous cultures , people who could help them to fill in the gaps their research could not . And it was when speaking to one such professor that the elusive obvious was put to him . “ Why do n't you actually talk to the Hopi tribe about this game ? ”
It was finally doing this that led Ben to realising how far off track he 'd gone . After talking to people of the tribe for a while , listening to them about their art and their stories , they had their apocalyptic moment .
“ They 're people . ”
What had been a project , part faithful desire to tell unknown tales , part desire to prove someone wrong , they realised , was actually the real-life stories of real-life people . “ And I was not treating them way , ” they admitted with humility . “ A lot of what I was doing was hurting them . I could n't do it justice , because they did n't want me to do it justice . ”
Donut County is a beautiful game about a hole that consumes and regurgitates objects , set in the place Esposito lives , telling the stories he 's involved in . It looks as magical as Kachino once did when first revealed in 2013 , but it features no totem poles or Hopi dolls . Esposito wants to tell their own story .
“ Research does not equal lived experience , ” they said in conclusion . Before adding something pretty damned wise . “ Folks are not trying to silence you by telling you you 're trying to silence them . ”
I love Esposito 's story . I want to defend him , champion them for their good intentions , their benevolent desire to communicate something . And I struggle along to the same conclusions , that sometimes a story is not your story to tell . “ If it 's really important to tell someone 's narrative , ” they add , “ let them tell it. ” If someone is not in a position to tell their story , maybe look at ways to help it get told . But do n't assume it 's yours to tell .
“ When you get called out , ” Esposito finished , “ shut up and listen . Examine your position . Learn from them . Learn to shut up . ”

Since Bluebox announced that it had found a `` masterkey '' hole in Android , various security researchers have been looking into what the problem could be . It appears that the problem is a simple implementation bug in how Android verifies JAR/ZIP/APK files . An issue on the CyanogenMod developers ' tracker sheds more light on the problem . It is possible to take an Android archive file and add a modified version of a Java class file before the original file in the archive . When the Android operating system goes to verify the signature on the file , it examines the latter , original file and , as this is unchanged , will pass the archive as valid . But when the archive is actually used , it is the first , modified version of the file in the archive that is used .
CyanogenMod project lead , Steve Kondik , has already committed a patch by Geremy Condra of Google , which adds a check for duplicate names and throws an exception when one occurs . Examining the current Android Open Source Project source tree shows that this fix has not been applied to the relevant file , which is in line with what Jeff Forristal , CTO of Bluebox said in interviews .
The appearance of two files with identical names in a JAR/ZIP/APK archive will provide application scanners with a simple signature for detecting modified archives and , presumably , it is this that Google scanned for when checking the content of the Google Play Store . An attacker would still need to introduce a modified APK into the delivery chain somehow . It is still unclear how Bluebox 's claim that manipulating system packages could give attacks arbitrary privileges as , in order to install or replace a system package , an attacker would already need system privileges .
The big problem for Google now though , is to ensure that the tens of millions of Android devices that have been sold do get updated with fixed firmware . A first step would at least be to apply the fix to the open source version of Android officially . Although the threat can be mitigated by better app store hygiene .

It is a sad and unfortunate fact that the gun violence epidemic -- which kills tens of thousands of Americans every year -- has a disproportionate impact on the black community . This is true not only for men , but for black women as well .
I lead a gun violence prevention organization called the Violence Policy Center . Each year , we release a report for Domestic Violence Awareness Month called When Men Murder Women , which analyzes national and statewide data on women murdered by men .
Year after year , we have found that black women are impacted by violence at levels far disproportionate to their numbers . In this year 's report , we found that 468 black females were murdered by men in single victim/single offender incidents in 2012 , the most recent year for which data is available .
Black women were killed by men at a rate of 2.46 per 100,000 -- nearly two and a half times the rate for white women , who were murdered by males at a rate of 1.00 per 100,000 . ( For our analysis , we use unpublished data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's Supplementary Homicide Report . )
Firearms -- especially handguns -- were the most common weapon males used to murder black females . When the weapon could be identified , 57 percent of black female victims were shot and killed with guns . Within that group , 76 percent were killed with a handgun .
We also found that with very few exceptions , black women were murdered not by strangers but by men known to them -- most often by intimate partners . When the relationship between the victim and offender could be identified , 92 percent of black females knew their killers . Within that group , 56 percent were wives , common-law wives , ex-wives , or girlfriends of their killers .
Most often , black women were killed by males in the course of an argument . The vast majority of these homicides were not related to any other felony crime such as rape or robbery . When circumstances could be identified , 86 percent of the murders were not related to the commission of another felony .
Understanding the circumstances of these murders is very important . The facts show that for black women , just as for all women , gun violence is most often linked with domestic violence . This means that stopping gun violence against women goes hand in hand with stopping domestic abuse . It means we should demand new laws at the state and federal levels to ensure domestic abusers can not have guns .
The White House said on Friday that it was considering additional “ tools ” to use against Venezuela following Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro 's order for the arrest of the Caracas mayor and accusations that the U.S. had backed a coup against the government .
A White House reporter asked White House spokesperson Josh Earnest whether the U.S. was considering additional sanctions against Venezuela . Earnest responded and said that the State and Treasury departments were watching the situation closely and that they were considering “ tools ” that could be used to “ steer ” Venezuela in a better direction , Reuters reports .
“ The Treasury Department and the State Department are closely monitoring this situation and are considering tools that may be available that can better steer the Venezuelan government in the direction that they believe they should be headed , ” Earnest said .
Earnest said that the accusations that the U.S. was planning a coup against the Venezuelan government were “ ludicrous . ”
“ The fact is the Venezuelan government should stop trying to blame the United States and other countries for events inside Venezuela , ” they said . “ The Venezuelan government needs to deal with the grave situation it faces . ”
The comments from the White House follow the arrest of a key Venezuelan opposition leader and Caracas metropolitan mayor Antonio Ledezma on Thursday night , in a move that Maduro 's government said was needed to halt a U.S.-backed coup plot .
According to Reuters , Venezuelan intelligence agents stormed the 59-year-old veteran politician 's office in the banking district of Caracas after breaking down doors and firing shots in the air , witnesses had said .
“ I just saw how they took Ledezma out of their office as if they were a dog , ” wrote opposition legislator Ismael Garcia via Twitter . “ They broke down the doors without an arrest warrant . ”
The U.S. State Department issued a statement on Friday night condemning the arrest of Ledezma and said that the move was a clear attempt by the government to divert attention away from the country 's economic and political situation .
The statement by the U.S. State Department :
The United States condemns the detention of Caracas Metropolitan Mayor Antonio Ledezma by Venezuelan security forces , as well as the systematic intimidation of other leading opposition figures . These actions appear to be a clear attempt by the Venezuelan government to divert attention from the country 's economic and political challenges . Rather than imprisoning and intimidating its critics , the Venezuelan government should focus on finding real solutions through democratic dialogue . Venezuela 's problems can not be solved by criminalizing legitimate , democratic dissent . These tactics violate the Venezuelan people 's basic human rights and civil liberties and flout the principles and values set forth in the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the Inter-American Democratic Charter . The Venezuelan government should release those it has unjustly jailed and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedoms of expression , association , and peaceful assembly . The United States calls on other countries , leaders , and organizations to urge the Venezuelan government to cease these efforts to silence the political opposition and further weaken democratic institutions .
On February 12 , President Maduro announced during a nationwide televised address that a coup plot against the Venezuelan government had been foiled , and that both civilians and members of the military had been detained , teleSUR news reported .
Maduro claimed that those that were involved in the plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government were being paid in U.S. dollars , and that one of the suspects had been granted a visa to enter the U.S. if the plot had failed .
Maduro said that the coup plotters already had a “ transitional ” government and program lined up once the plan — which included bombings of the Presidential Palace and various other offices throughout Caracas , as well as the assassinations of members of the opposition , Maduro and others — was carried out .
The U.S. State Department issued a statement on Thursday denying any such involvement in a coup attempt or destabilization in Venezuela and called the accusations “ baseless and false ” .
An excerpt from the statement by the U.S. State Department :
The allegations made by the Venezuelan government that the United States is involved in coup plotting and destabilization are baseless and false . The United States does not support political transitions by non-constitutional means . The United States is not promoting unrest in Venezuela nor are we attempting to undermine Venezuela 's economy or its government . We remain Venezuela 's largest trading partner . Venezuela 's economic and political problems are the result of the policies of the Venezuelan government . The Venezuelan government should stop attempting to distract attention from the country 's economic and political problems and focus on finding real solutions through democratic dialogue among Venezuelans . We regret that the Venezuelan government continues to blame the United States or other members of the international community for events inside Venezuela . The Venezuelan government needs to deal with the grave situation it faces .
Late on Friday night , Reuters reported that the state prosecutor 's office in Venezuela had indicted Antonio Ledezma for conspiracy of plotting violence against the government and would be jailed in the military prison of Ramo Verde , the same prison where hardline opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez has been locked up for a year .
Antonio Ledezma will be jailed at the military prison pending a trial , according to Reuters .
“ No one is untouchable in Venezuela , ” Maduro said on Friday night , according to Reuters . “ We 'll use an iron fist against coup-mongers . ”
Maduro is facing a number of challenges on their domestic front in Venezuela , including a contracting economy , low oil prices , surging inflation , dwindling foreign currency reserves , mounting debt , the risk of a sovereign default , an unhappy electorate , shortages of basic foods and household products , and social unrest .
As more players enter the power meter market , price competition is heating up . After PowerTap dropped its pricing , SRAM has followed suit by announcing that it is now selling its Quarq power meters at a lower cost .
Quarq power meters — including SRAM RED 22 , Quarq ELSA and Quarq RIKEN — will now be sold without chainrings as a 'chassis ' , meaning crank arms , power meter spider and chainring bolts . But even with the cost of chainrings factored in , the new prices are about US $ 230 / £350 less than before .
Selling the units without chainrings is a way to give bike shops and bike riders more flexibility , SRAM said , allowing for one chassis to be used with 10-speed , 11-speed or 1x chainrings .
A full price listing is below , but as an example , the SRAM Red 22 GXP chassis now sells for US $ 1,600 / £1,199 , or US $ 1,779 / £1,224 with SRAM Red 22 chainrings . Compare this to the previous SRAM Red 22 GXP complete crankset , priced at US $ 1,995 / £1,599 .
The new pricing puts Quarq about in the middle of the power-meter market . It is now more in line with the Garmin Vector power meter pedals , more expensive than Stages and the base-level PowerTap , but far cheaper than SRM .
The Quarq power meter spider comes at a few different price points

Apple could become a trillion dollar company within 12 months , Wall Street analyst Brian White said in a research note obtained by MacRumors .
As of Friday , Apple 's stock price was at $ 144 , down from its all-time high of $ 156 in May , but White says the lower price is “ yet another buying opportunity ” as investors anticipate the launch of the iPhone 8 later this year .

White said the iPhone company remains `` among the most underappreciated stocks in the world . ''
White wrote :
“ In our view , Apple 's quarterly results will be less important this summer as investors are focused on the iPhone 8 this fall , along with the company 's raised capital distribution initiative , depressed valuation and new innovations as showcased at WWDC . We still believe Apple remains among the most underappreciated stocks in the world . ”
White added the upcoming iPhone lineup is positioning Apple to reach their $ 202 price target within 12 months . That price would value the Cupertino giant as over a trillion dollar company based on market capitalization , which is currently about $ 737 billion .
“ Similar to the bottoming process in Apple during the summer of 2013 that drove a strong rally into the spring of 2015 , we believe the bottom in the stock during May 2016 and the upcoming iPhone cycle is setting up Apple to reach our $ 202.00 price target over the next 12 months , ” White said .

Other analysts have predicted Apple could reach or surpass a trillion dollar market cap . In May , RCB Capital analyst Amit Daryanani said in a note to clients the iPhone 8 and Apple 's services business could send the company 's value above $ 1 trillion in 2018 .
`` We believe AAPL 's current stock price creates an attractive entry point for investors to benefit from its ability to return to revenue and EPS growth in FY17 , '' analyst Amit Daryanani wrote , according to CNBC . `` AAPL has potential to achieve a $ 1.0 trillion dollar market cap and even surpass that over the next 12–18 months , '' they added .
The analyst gave a scenario of how that can happen :
`` ( 1 ) higher revenue growth through FY18/19 ( mid- to high-single-digit ) driven by ASP [ average selling price ] tailwind ( blended ASP ~ $ 800 ) and unit growth ; ( 2 ) gross margins expanding by 20–30bps ( services contribution offset by iPhone BOM ) ; ( 3 ) operating margins expanding by ~100bps via . SG & A controls ; and ( 4 ) sustained buyback-driven tailwinds enabling low-teens EPS growth ; and ( 5 ) repatriation tailwind ( not baked into our scenario but could add upside to EPS ) . ''
Meanwhile , UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in March Apple could hit a $ 200 stock price if all goes well for the company over the next few years . Milunovich predicted a scenario in which Apple 's stock would spike by 40 percent by 2019 .
“ For Apple to hit $ 200 , iPhone needs to continue to grow beyond F18 , new product categories must be established , and buybacks should exceed $ 50bn per year , boosting the P/E to 17x , '' Milunovich wrote , according to Business Insider .
The analyst also predicted a separate , most likely scenario in which Apple 's stock could be priced at $ 175 in two or three years .

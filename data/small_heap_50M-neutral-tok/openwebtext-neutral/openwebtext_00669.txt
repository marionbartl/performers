Swallowing pills containing a concentrate of fecal bacteria successfully stops recurrent bouts of debilitating Clostridium difficile ( C. diff ) infection by rebalancing the bacteria in the gut , suggests a study being presented at the IDWeek 2013™ meeting today .
Infection from C. diff bacteria is such a concern that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) named it one of the three most urgent threats in its recent landmark report on antibiotic resistance . C. diff sickens half a million Americans and kills 14,000 every year . C. diff infection can occur after people take antibiotics , wiping out the good bacteria in the gastrointestinal ( GI ) system , allowing C. diff to flourish and leading to severe diarrhea . In some patients , infection continues to recur despite standard treatment with antibiotics . For patients trapped in that cycle , doctors have transplanted feces from healthy donors into their GI system to rebalance the bacteria and stop infections from recurring .
Fecal transplantation typically is delivered by enema , colonoscopy ( placing a tube in the colon ) or nose tube and is effective in nine out of 10 patients , according to published reports . The IDWeek research suggests the less-invasive pills are a viable and effective delivery method .
`` Recurrent C. diff infection is such a miserable experience and patients are so distraught that many ask for fecal transplantation because they 've heard of its success , '' said Thomas Louie , MD , professor of medicine at the University of Calgary , Alberta , and lead author of the pill study . `` Many people might find the idea of fecal transplantation off-putting , but those with recurrent infection are thankful to have a treatment that works . ''
Indeed , additional research being presented at the meeting showed patients who received fecal transplantation through a tube in the nose were highly satisfied with the treatment , and said they would likely recommend it to a friend .
Fecal Transplantation by Pill
University of Calgary researchers reported a 100 percent success rate -- none of the 27 patients who took the tablet-sized pills had a recurrence of C. diff , even though all of them previously had had at least four bouts of the infection . Patients ingested between 24 and 34 capsules containing fecal bacteria , often donated by family members .
To make the pills , researchers processed the feces until it contained only bacteria , and then encapsulated the bacterial concentrate inside three layers of gelatin capsule . This ensured the pills would n't leak or disintegrate until they were past the stomach and into the small intestine -- a potential advantage over other methods because it covers more of the GI tract , does not involve invasive and more costly procedures , and is more comfortable for patients , Dr. Louie said .
Dr. Louie said they first made pills for fecal transplantation when one patient failed to respond to the enema method on two occasions and also could not tolerate a nasal tube for medical reasons . The pills are made individually .
`` The pills are a one-shot deal and seem to work . They are easier for patients and are well-tolerated , '' said Dr. Louie . `` It 's an exciting development in the field and could possibly even be used to maintain the balance of bacteria in the GI system in patients at risk for C . diff . '' ''
Patient Satisfaction of Fecal Transplantation
In the study of fecal transplantation tolerance , researchers surveyed 28 patients three months after they had undergone the treatment through a tube fed through the nose and GI system to the small intestine . On a scale of one to 10 , average patient scores were : 9.6 for overall satisfaction ; 9.9 for ease ; and 9.9 for likelihood of recommending the procedure to a family member or friend .
`` Patients with C. diff often have 20 or more stools a day , which seriously affects quality of life and so they are very open to this treatment , '' said Ravi Kamepalli , MD , an infectious diseases physician at the Regional Infectious Disease-Infusion Center , Lima , Ohio , and lead author of the study . `` Human beings are 90 percent bacteria and once that balance is altered with antibiotics , opportunistic infections can cause serious problems . All we are doing with this treatment is resetting the balance . ''
Dr. Kamepalli said they have treated 40 patients with recurrent C. diff using fecal transplantation , and all but one were cured , a 98 percent success rate .
C. diff is considered a healthcare-associated infection ( HAI ) because those at highest risk are older people who are taking antibiotics and receiving medical care , such as in a hospital or nursing home . HAI C. diff remains at high levels , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . Antibiotics targeted to C. diff may wipe out these bad bugs , but because levels of good bacteria in the GI system are low , C. diff infection can recur once the antibiotics are stopped . C. diff infection recurs after antibiotic treatment in about 20 percent of patients , and in those patients , it is 80 percent likely to recur .

But they that taketh warning shall deliver their soul.6But if the watchman see the sword come , and blow not the trumpet , and the people be not warned ; if the sword come , and take any person from among them , they are taken away in their iniquity ; but their blood will I require at the watchman 's hand.7So thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me.8When I say unto the wicked , O wicked man , thou shalt surely die ; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from their way , that wicked man shall die in their iniquity ; but their blood will I require at thine hand.9Nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of their way to turn from it ; if they do not turn from their way , they shall die in their iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
On Sunday 's broadcast of Fox News Channel 's “ Sunday Morning Futures , ” host Maria Bartiromo confronted House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise ( R-LA ) about the approaching deadline for Congress to pass legislation on health care and tax reform .
Bartiromo asked Scalise about the possibility of Congress forgoing its August recess to get those bills through .
Scalise at first said they believed deadlines would force people to come to the table , but added they would stay in and get it done when asked about “ not taking a vacation . ”
Watch :
Partial transcript as follows :
BARTIROMO : You got to admit , the American people are just outraged by the calendar in terms of Congress . I mean , you have got – what , 38 days left or less in terms of actually working . How is it possible that you guys have the entire month of August off ? Is it possible that if you do n't get tax reform done that you will forgo your August recess and you 'll keep working until you get this done ?
SCALISE : Well , I have always been somebody that says you get your work done while you are there . There are deadlines for a reason . It forces people to come to the table . You know , we have no working on healthcare and tax cuts for months now . And ultimately you need those deadlines to force the folks that are still not there yet –
BARTIROMO : So you 'll get it done ?
SCALISE : — to focus and get the job done . We have to get it done . We have to pass health care reform , and we 've got to cut taxes and simplify the code . Imagine if you can actually do your tax returns on a postcard .
BARTIROMO : Yeah .
SCALISE : Over 90 percent of Americans will get that with our bill . And you cut tax rates for everybody and repeal –
( CROSSTALK )
BARTIROMO : And if you wo n't you not take vacation ?
SCALISE : We are just going to stay in and get it done , Maria . That is a thing . You know , we 're going to get the job done . We have to for the American people . And this economy is waiting . There is so much demand that is pent-up . Let 's get it done .
It 's the announcement you 've been waiting to hear . Since the rise of leg locks and more and more people are getting frustrated with the IBJJF 's restrictive rule system , David Aguzzi has broken the mold with their promotion and competition , Grappling Industries .
In a short amount of time Grappling Industries have put on some massive matches , including a no time limit , sub-only match between Gordon Ryan and Keenan Cornelius . Now they are looking to shake up the restrictive rule system that has seen BJJ fall ill to world champions being made by an advantage . The following rule changes will happen from 2017 onwards…
Blue Belts & Purple Belts
Grappling Industries will now allow toe-holds and knee bars from blue belt and intermediate No-Gi competitions .
Brown Belt & Black Belts
Reaping the knee will be legalised , heel hooks , twisters , and scissor takedowns will all be legal for these belts and above .
Eddie Bravo Invitational Rules
Owner David Aguzzi has also been in talks with Eddie Bravo and will be introducing EBI format rules into their round-competitions . With the full backing of Eddie Bravo .
Current Grappling Industries Ruleset
All Grappling Industries events will follow IBJJF points structure , which includes refereeing , rendering decisions , points scoring , advantages & penalties ( IBJJF Rule book , articles 1 to 7 ) . They have 3 exceptions to their Legal/Illegal Submissions Chart that are in our NoGi Advanced and NoGi Absolute Divisions which are Heel Hooks , Twisters , and Knee Reaping are LEGAL in these divisions .
Since their events are using the “ Round Robin ” format , they will not follow the IBJJF obligations , bans , and demands ( Rule book , article 8 ) , the general competition guidelines and the competition format . In addition to articles 1 to 7 , please make sure to read the following guidelines to fully understand the rules and regulations in place at Grappling Industries events .
During their designated Submission Only events , no points or advantages will be scored . Matches will result in a draw unless one competitor was significantly much more aggressive than the other in attempting to the finish the fight in which case they could be rewarded the decision by the referee .
For some people , it 's not enough that bibles are already allowed in public schools and kids can read it for pleasure if they want to .
Idaho legislators have now introduced Senate Bill 1321 , which would allow teachers to use the Bible in the classroom whenever they think it would enhance the lesson . That 's already allowed in , say , English class , where you might discuss biblical allusions in literature and where you might want to analyze the Bible 's more poetic passages… but the bill would permit teachers to use the Bible anywhere and everywhere :
The Bible is expressly permitted to be used in Idaho public schools for reference purposes to further the study of literature , comparative religion , English and foreign languages , United States and world history , comparative government , law , philosophy , ethics , astronomy , biology , geology , world geography , archaeology , music , sociology , and other topics of study where an understanding of the Bible may be useful or relevant . No student will be required to use any religious texts for reference purposes if the student or parents of the student object .
Unless we 're pointing at the Bible and saying , “ this offers nothing of use , ” I have no clue why anyone would ever need to reference the Bible in Astronomy , Geology , Archaeology , or Biology class . Or any class that relies on facts and observation and reason and logic .
If passed , this bill would actually replace the now-unconstitutional law that once allowed mandatory Bible readings in school .

Last time around , I wrote about how , when I 'm looking at hiring designers , I always look beyond the screenshots and portfolio visuals they 've put together and look to see what their personality and attitude is like .
Now , I 'm not the hiring manager at an organisation that 's hiring tens of designers every month–when you 're in that position , your approach ( and the people you 're on the lookout for ) is a little different . People are going to disagree with what I 'm saying here , particularly if they 're hiring designers for the oil and gas industry or something like that . But for smaller companies and startups , this is the way we work .
When I hire , I 'm not looking for rockstar designers or gurus–that self-proclaimed Picasso of CSS is distinctly unappealing .
Instead , I 'm looking for people who are going to join our team and make it stronger . The way you communicate is a critical part of that . But that does n't mean that words can replace a decent portfolio all by themselves .
First things first : your CV puts me to sleep
Seriously , can we stop this ‘ thing ' where designers send their CV as a PDF , and consider that to be a solid application for a position ? I know what it 's like to put together a CV–you want to list all the skills you 've got in your toolbelt , and you do n't want to leave anything out . Every extra thing you can list will make you look stronger , right ?
Yeah… that 's not quite right . I honestly do n't think there has ever been a more infuriating bullet point than this one :
“ ● Proficient in Microsoft Office ”
Who are you trying to kid here ? I 'm not representing the HR department of a law firm . And even if I was , I would be sick to death of people sending me CVs describing their proficiency in Microsoft Office . Look–if you 're telling me you 're an experienced Photoshop user and are comfortable working with Git , I do n't need to be told that you 're capable of typing words into a Word doc , saving those words , and perhaps using the “ Print ” function .
Pet peeve aside , sending a dull and corporate CV ( even if you 've done some design work to make the layout look a bit better ) is just not the right approach when you 're trying to get yourself hired by a startup or a small team . Here 's an example :
2008-2009
Small City Design College – Diploma in Digital Design 2009-2011
Random University – BA in Visual Communications 2011-2012
Random University – Masters in Visual Communications 2010-2011
Random Company LLC
Web design , illustration , client communication 2011-2012
Another Indistinguishable Corporation
Writing , designing stuff
That list takes up at least 12 lines , and honestly , tells me nothing helpful about your journey so far , nor what you 've actually learned in that time .
Take a look at Allison House–I know she 's a very experienced designer and has a lot of experience that they can share , but they still nail it with them about page . It 's infinitely more revealing than a dull CV , and gives a plain-English walkthrough of what she 's done in their career so far . Even if you ca n't say you 've worked at companies like Dropbox , Codecademy and Treehouse , a description of what you actually did in each job is a whole heap more helpful than just listing an obscure company name and expecting the person doing the hiring to look it up . Tell a story to get this information across–I hired several people who did this . Here 's one , and here 's another .
Please stop applying for jobs as a web designer when you do n't have a website
If you 're a logo designer or illustrator and do n't have a portfolio website , I 'd say that 's a negative , but not a dealbreaker . You can just about get by with Dribbble and Behance .
But if you 're emailing me to ask if I 'm looking for a web designer and you do n't have a website , that creates a horrendous first impression . It 's not hard to get one up nowadays . It does n't even need to cost you anything . GitHub has a complete step-by-step guide that 'll walk you through setting up with free hosting–it takes about 15 minutes from start to finish .
Honestly , even a Squarespace site is not ideal , but at least it 's better than nothing .
Please do n't take this the wrong way
Let 's get this straight–I 'm not advocating building a crazy , customised job application site like this one . Do n't get me wrong : they can definitely work . If you have a very thin portfolio and desperately want to improve your chances of getting a position , it might be worth doing something like this .
But spending days building one for a specific job is n't something I think is fair for a company to demand , and I do n't think it 's necessary if you already have good work out there that you can share .
But you need to have something to share . If you do n't , then do n't blame other people when your job application emails are getting turned down . Sending an email with your CV and asking if someone is hiring , just is n't going to cut it anymore .

Dublin city councillors are set to block a proposal to build skyscrapers in the capital at a council meeting today .
The draft of the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022 suggests raising height limits up to 28 metres in the inner city , up to 2 metres near stations and up to 16 metres in the rest of the city .
Dublin 's Chamber of Commerce say building skyscrapers could solve the housing crisis and urban sprawl as well as giving the economy a boost .
But councillors say that high rise buildings could put the character of Dublin city at risk .
At the meeting 11 motions from councillors seek to reduce these heights , arguing that low-rise heights are more suited to the traditional style of the city .
City council chief executive , Owen Keegan told The Irish Times that the current restrictions are too severe .
They said : '' Reducing the definition of of 'low-rise ' to the height of typical Georgian buildings . . . would have severe repercussions across the city in terms of employment , competitiveness , housing provision , together with critical infrastructure such as transport and hostels . ''
However , Independent councillor Nial Ring told The Irish Daily Mail :
`` I have put a motion forward that building height be capped at 20 metres . ''
`` We have to get the balance right in terms of quality of life .
`` Dublin has very narrow streets that are not suited to high-rise buildings . The docklands will soon have a huge amount of new housing . there will be 2,700 new apartments there and 3,000 in the former Irish Glass Bottle site .
`` We do have a housing crisis and we do need to build but not at the expense of our city 's character . Dublin is a low-rise city , not a sprawling Manhattan . ''
If the plan is confirmed , the new height restrictions will come into effect in November .

Joseph Potts , the man charged with shooting a dog at a Clear Lake dog park in January , was in court today to face the charge against him.Potts , 26 , is charged with one count of cruelty to non-livestock animals.Potts , who is a concealed handgun license holder , shot a dog on January 25.The case was presented to the Harris County District Attorney 's office and charges were filed on Monday.But today , court documents reveal new alleged details about the shooting and what led to it.One of the dog 's owners , Karey Wilson , claims that they let their bull terrier , Diesel , roam the park without holding its leash . While they talked with another person at the park , they heard growling and when they turned , they claim they saw their dog being kicked by Potts and their wife.Wilson claims they ran toward their dog and that 's when they say they saw Potts shoot him.Diesel was euthanized at a local animal hospital as a result of the shooting injuries , court papers show.Potts claimed the animal threatened their family 's safety and their two dogs . Their wife , Jennifer Potts , claims they were afraid of being bitten and Diesel was snarling and sniping at their dogs.However , a witness reportedly said the dogs - Diesel and Potts ' dogs - looked `` to be just playing . '' That witness told investigators they felt the shooting `` was not necessary '' and Potts `` could have easily grabbed the ( Diesel 's ) harness ... until Diesel 's owner could arrive . `` Another witness says they saw what happened and also thought the dogs were playing , not fighting . That witness added that it did not appear that Potts nor their wife were in any danger.Potts is out on $ 5,000 bond .

He 's way , way off .
Fifty years ago , the democratic socialist activist and writer Michael Harrington published The Other America , which chronicled the state of the American poor at that time . The book shed light on what was at the time an especially marginalized population , easily ignored by middle and upper-class Americans who did n't venture into the urban ghettos and rural communities where most of the poor lived . Most notably , the book , in part due to a review of it by the social critic Dwight MacDonald in The New Yorker , helped convinced the Johnson administration to launch the war on poverty .
The 50th anniversary is prompting a fair amount of useful reflection on poverty reduction efforts since the book 's publication , notably at a conference being held at Demos today . Which raises the question : what has happened to poverty since The Other America ?
The poverty rate went down , and stayed down
First thing 's first : Here 's how the poverty rate has changed since 1959 , three years before Harrington 's book came out :
There are two things to note here . First , there was a huge fall in the poverty rate throughout the 1960s , and in particular after LBJ announced the War on Poverty in 1964 and followed up with Medicaid , Medicare , greater federal housing spending , and other programs to fight that war . In 1964 , the poverty rate was 19 percent . Ten years later , it was 11.2 percent , and it has not gone above 15.2 percent any year since then . Contrary to what you may have heard , the best evidence indicates that the War on Poverty made a real and lasting difference .
Second , since the permanent decline achieved during the 1960s , most of the variation in the poverty rate has been cyclical : it goes up in recessions and down during booms . During the early 1980s recession , the rate spiked , only to fall again when the labor market recovered later in the decade . Same thing with the early 1990s recessions and late '90s boom . And the current recession has spurred an increase again . The most recent numbers we have are for 2010 , and that year 's rate - 15.1 percent - is about as high as it 's gotten since the 1960s .
We 're doing more to fight it
One of the limitations of the official poverty rate is that it does not count government benefits like food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit as income , despite the importance of those programs to the working poor . More recently , the Census Bureau has adopted a metric that takes government programs into account and updates the methodology behind the poverty rate in a number of other ways , such as accounting for regional variations in cost of living and higher medical costs ( which can read about in fuller detail here ) .
That measure is only available for 2009 and 2010 , but the National Academy of Sciences proposed a similar alternative measure for which data is available from 1999 onwards , and the Census used a separate alternative metric from 1980 to 2009 as well . Let 's compare how the previous Census alternative metric compares to the official one ( for the data nerds , I 'm using definition 13 , as does the University of Michigan 's National Poverty Center here ) :
As you can see , trends in poverty show up the same in both measures , but the alternative measure , which includes Medicaid , the Earned Income Tax Credit , etc. , is consistently lower . This tells us that our poverty programs are keeping roughly the same amount of people ( 1-3 percent of the population ) out of poverty each year . In 2009 , that number jumped to 2.9 percent . Indeed , Demos estimates that 40 million Americans were kept out of poverty due to food stamps , the Earned Income Tax Credit , Medicaid , and other programs in 2010 .
You can also see this if you look at how much the government has spent on anti-poverty programs in the past half century . This chart just includes programs like food stamps , the Earned Income Tax Credit , and Medicaid that solely target low-income people , and even when you adjust for inflation , we 're spending far more :
If you include programs like Medicare and Social Security that help many elderly people escape poverty , but also serve middle and upper income people , the rise is even more dramatic :
The bulk of that growth is in health care spending , however , which is growing not because programs are helping more people but because the cost of care is rising , which helps explain why increased spending since the 1970s has not resulted in a sustained decline in poverty .
It 's still racially concentrated
Just as in Michael Harrington 's day , the poverty rate for black and Hispanic Americans , is much higher than for non-Hispanic whites and Asian-Americans . Unfortunately , the Census did n't distinguish between Hispanics and whites until the early 1970s , and did not start calculating the poverty rate for Asian-Americans until 1987 , but even the data we do have are striking :
Both white and black poverty fell dramatically during the 1960s , though the drop in black poverty from 55.1 percent in 1959 to 32.2 percent in 1969 is particularly remarkable . More recently , it appears that white and Asian-American poverty have become decoupled from the state of the economy , whereas black and Hispanic poverty remains heavily cyclical , with a big fall during the 1990s boom and a corresponding rise as the recession hit in 2009 and 2010 . Hispanic poverty overtook black poverty from 1994 to 1997 , and it looks as though the two are converging again .
UPDATE : A few commenters suggested it might make more sense to look at how government spending has changed in terms of % of GDP , rather than inflation-adjusted dollars , to remove population growth as a factor , as well as moving to a logarithmic scale to highlight the rate of change . Upon reflection , I agree ! Here 's that chart :
Particularly for low-income programs , the growth in spending during the War on Poverty is quite dramatic , as one would expect . Interestingly , there do n't seem to be real cuts during the Reagan years , despite their reputation as a welfare slasher .
Why are there are so many choral arrangements of David Bowie 's “ ‘ Heroes ' ” ? Imagine a world without them . It 's easy if you try . In the wake of Bowie 's death , one of their most iconic songs has been transformed into pure schmaltz for cheap emotional appeal . In the trailer for Ang Lee 's Billy Lynn 's Long Halftime Walk and the fourth episode of Stranger Things , these cheesy choirs sing the lyrics so quietly that it takes a few bars to notice that you 're being had , and then you 're taken out of it and prevented from having any kind of authentic emotional experience . The cloying sentimentality of these opportunistic and lazy covers feels cheap for a few reasons : Bowie 's death is borrowed for its cultural significance and sadness , so the reference—whether it 's a climactic scene of kids discovering the body of their friend in a lake , or PTSD flashbacks of a soldier that 's returned home from Iraq—does n't earn its own pathos , and you 're distracted by the clashing of meta cultural clashing of Bowie 's death , the song 's gooey lyrics , and whatever dramatic or inspiring scene that 's happening on the screen .
The phenomenon of acoustic , choral , or otherwise stripped-down arrangements of pop songs predates this “ ‘ Heroes ' ” bit by 15 years at least : Gary Jules ' cover of “ Mad World ” by Tears for Fears gave the song new life when it was used at the end of Donnie Darko in 2001 . To be fair , this was one of the few examples that benefitted from a moodier arrangement . The 1983 version is heavily produced and very dated new wave , a very busy and fast performance of a song whose lyrics benefitted from a real black hoodie candlelight take , something that could be used in a montage of people looking wistfully out of windows . There is n't enough space in the Tears for Fears original . This is not the case for “ ‘ Heroes ' ” , a perfect recording in every regard : instrumentally propulsive and uplifting , with a shooting star guitar part by Robert Fripp and one of Bowie 's most soaring and searing vocal takes . When it was used at the end of 2012 's The Perks of Being a Wallflower , it made me weepy both times I saw it , these wide-eyed sad kids driving into the city to that massive and essential bass line .
Because if you 're going to alter the arrangement of a famous song and remove all of its identifiable instrumental elements , you 're left with the lyrics , and “ ‘ Heroes ' ” just is n't inspiring on its own : you need the bass hook , the spectral guitars , and the determined march mirroring Bowie 's impassioned performance . It 's the sound of their voice and the bed track that makes “ ‘ Heroes ' ” so inspiring , not the lyrics . As with most of their songs , there are good lines here and there , but they do n't work well as a piece , especially when laid bare on the page . The lyrics work nicely as a patina on top of the whole arrangement , but they ca n't really stand on their own . These sorts of minor-key , stripped down covers are especially common with big hip-hop songs , like “ Hey Ya ! ” or “ Gangsta 's Paradise. ” These range from annoying to racist , their existence implying that the originals are silly or slight or lacking in emotional weight or seriousness , and that maybe if a bearded white guy played some finger-picked guitar really slowly and crooned it , they 'd be “ real songs. ” The media 's latest exercise in emotional laziness might not be as offensive as coffeehouse Outkast covers , but they render what they score dead and heavy .

Often appearing black from afar , the feathers of a wild turkey actually contain an array of hues . ( Pioneer Press : Dave Orrick )
The pads of a wild turkey 's feet catch the sun shortly after it was shot Thursday . ( Pioneer Press : Dave Orrick ) ?
Wild turkeys suck and so do I .
That 's how I felt at 10:45 a.m. Thursday .
I was in the woods on my belly — bare belly , since my pants were twisted around my waist and mostly below it and my shirts and jacket were crumpled up under my arms .
Something prickly was poking me in my navel and ticks were crawling God knows where .
I had been working myself into this gradually worsening position for the better part of an hour as a tom , a mature male turkey , taunted me from 30 yards away , literally running circles around me . I was on an elevated knob . The turkey was just below the edge .
The few times they popped their head up momentarily , they are n't where my gun was pointing . First off my left shoulder , then off the right . In the meantime , they kept circling my position , or rather , the position of a $ 9.99 rubber decoy of a female turkey that could n't fool a bat .
They kept circling , and I kept swiveling to match him , I hoped , while in the prone position , gradually disrobing myself .
It was a sight gag , and I was the chump . The keystone cop chasing Benny Hill . The Stooge who steps in front of Moe as he 's swinging the hammer .
This was nothing new to me . This was my third season of turkey hunting . I got hooked on my first season when I found myself in the middle of a gobblers ' ball but still failed . Last season was a more pathetic affair that left me so birdless as to afford me time to write a poem .
This year was supposed to be different . I had enlisted the help of outdoors writer Jack Hennessy , a slayer of many turkeys . We had high hopes .
On Tuesday , we scouted the area and hatched a plan so quickly that we had time to pick some morels and fish a nearby trout stream . That 's where Hennessy wound up with a hook deeply embedded in their trigger finger while trying to unhook an ornery pike . Field removal tactics failed us , so we headed for urgent care . Not 100 yards from us in the field , we saw a strutting tom preparing to mount a hen . In a parking lot near the clinic , two bearded turkeys milled about . Good signs for sure — and the hook was removed without a scalpel .
But dawn broke silently Wednesday , save one distant gobble late . My promises of a landscape packed with turkeys were hollow .
Alone Thursday morning , I found myself on a different patch of public land . I arrived after first light — a stupid thing to do when turkey hunting . Then it started raining — an unforecasted rain that was n't even acknowledged under my weather apps ' current conditions . And the woods were silent .
Stupid me , stupid meteorologists , stupid turkey hunting .
Of course , turkeys did eventually show . But I was set up on high ground when that tom was low . Then I moved low only to find them high , some 100 yards out , fanning , apparently , at my worthless decoy and gobbling at the silly croaks emanating from a hunk of latex in my mouth ( known as a diaphragm turkey call ) .
Eventually this cat-and-mouse game led me back to high ground , atop this knoll , where the comedy was turning into a farce .
Then I got angry .
Do n't hunt angry . Do n't fish angry . Do n't drive angry . Do n't write angry . Good advice , I think , to live by .
But there 's another school of thought . Willie Mosconi , the affable pool legend , used to say you 've got to hate your opponent “ a little . ”
I was beginning to hate this bird . I got more aggressive , scurrying toward the bluff 's edge where the bird was , rising from prone to sitting , and eventually to one knee . And making an obscene amount of noise with my call .
Finally , from behind a tree , some 20 yards down the bluff , their face popped in front of my shotgun barrel . And I shot that face . I was certain I would miss but happy to get the whole thing over with . To at least scare the jerk , to teach them a lesson not to make fools of earnest hunters .
But they dropped .
I ran to him , stomped my boot in their neck , and pressed their wings against their body as their final thrashes — perhaps the last moments of life , perhaps postmortem twitches — subsided .
I had never held a wild turkey before , or actually seen one so close .
The sun was out , and the bird 's feathers caught the rays and threw them back in an astonishing array of hues . From auburn to green to blue , it was autumn and spring , the entire spectrum on a quill . The feet were dirty , yet pristine .
And I felt bad that I had gotten angry with him . No , not guilty for killing the bird ; for that , I was elated . Feathers and bones for my son , a mountain of meat for my wife and parents visiting over the weekend .
So I hated a wild turkey , shot it in the face and now loved and admired it . It 's a paradox that makes no sense except to those who have shot one .
Those of us who have shot one .
Server Consolidation – High Population Servers Live as of September 18 , 2012
Earlier this summer we launched the Free Character Transfer Program which offered players the option to transfer their characters from specific origin servers to selected higher population destination servers . Following the success of the Free Character Transfer Program , and after closely monitoring server populations , we have now taken the next step in our on-going server population balancing process . We have upgraded destination servers in order to support a significantly higher number of players . In addition to this , all characters on origin servers have now been automatically transferred to be consolidated onto the upgraded destination servers . By centralizing our player populations on these higher population destination servers , we feel that we can offer our players the best possible Star Wars™ : The Old Republic™ experience .
As a result , you may find that some of your characters are now located on a different server . If your characters have been moved , you can find their new location on the server selection screen by clicking on the `` Characters '' column . Please be aware that no characters have been deleted as part of this process – all of your characters are still available to you and are ready to play !
Free Character Transfer – Closed
The Free Character Transfer Service is now closed
Players that have transferred their character onto a qualifying destination server by July 30th have received special in-game rewards , the Gannifari mini pet and 25 Black Hole Commendations . For more information please visit here .

Here 's the BBC , one of the many news outlets reporting on this :
Several commentators pointed out that the `` Malaysia '' logo on the plane from the photograph was in the wrong place . Maksim Kats , a Russian blogger , said the plane in the picture looked like a slightly altered version of the one that tops the search results if you Google `` Boeing view from above '' in Russian . It also happens to be a publicity photo of a Boeing 767 , not a 777 , which was shot down over Ukraine in July . Others noted that the fighter jet looked different from an Su-25 - the type which the Russian media had consistently claimed shot down MH17 . There were also claims that the shape of clouds in the satellite image proved that it actually came from a Google Earth photo of the area taken on 28 August 2012 .
The consensus is that the image seems to be fake . You can also find a detailed report in English on the investigative site bellingcat , which also talks about the maps being stitched together :
Overlaying the image with known data points about the MH17 flight path and debris gives the following results , showing the aircraft in the picture off the reported course . It is clear that the satellite map imagery is created from a composite of different satellite map imagery . Part of imagery is from historical Google Earth imagery , ... Other imagery is from Yandex maps .
To explain the geometry in the OP .
The plane is much bigger than the ground behind it : therefore the plane is much closer to the camera than the ground is .
If you look at something distant through the magnifying lens , that magnifies what you 're looking at and magnifies the background behind it . The so-called `` perspective '' is `` flattened '' .
If you look at something close ( using less magnification , because it 's closer ) it 's bigger than the background behind it .
Something that 's half-way between the camera and the background will appear to be twice as big as the background . In the case of this picture the plane is about 60 times bigger than the city , so it 's relatively very close .
If the camera and the plane are close to each other , and we know the distance of the plane to the ground , then we know the distance of the camera to the ground .
Also we know how wide the plane is . If a big plane occupies only 25 % of the picture when the camera is very close to the plane , that would imply that the picture had a huge field of view ( 315 degrees ) . For example , imagine an object that 's one meter wide . Stand one meter in front of it . Now imagine taking a picture where the object only occupies 20 % of the photo : to do that it would need to be panoramic .
The general commanding the US-led coalition against Islamic State said that Kurds will be involved in liberating Raqqa , the IS capital . Kurdish militias are considered terrorists by Turkey , which is also angling for a role in the battle .
`` I do anticipate there will be Kurds involved in Raqqa assault . There are Kurds from Raqqa , '' US Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend , commander of the Combined Joint Task Force for Operation Inherent Resolve ( CJT-OIR ) , told reporters on Wednesday .
`` There are going to be Kurds assaulting Raqqa for sure . The number , the size of them , and how many Kurdish units are participating in that , I ca n't really say right now , '' Townsend added , according to Reuters .
That sort of arrangement is not sitting well with Washington 's NATO ally Turkey , which considers the Syrian Kurdish militias ( PYD and YPG ) to be terrorist organizations allied with the Kurdistan Worker 's Party ( PKK ) . On Wednesday , the newspaper Yeni Safak reported that Ankara could bar the US from using Incirlik Air Base in southeastern Turkey if the coalition enlists the Kurds in capturing the capital of Islamic State ( IS , formerly ISIS/ISIL ) .
# Turkey starting 2look desperate 4 invitation to the party and # Kurds 2b kicked off the guestlist . Looks like a long shot # Raqqa # Manbijpic.twitter.com/Nbcl68QAo4 — Lizzie Phelan ( @ LizziePhelan ) March 1 , 2017
“ We are engaged in discussions with Turks on how they might participate in the liberation of Raqqa , and I do n't know what the numbers of their participation might be , '' Townsend said during Wednesday 's briefing .
Turkey invaded Syria in August 2016 , seeking to establish a “ security zone ” along its border in the operation dubbed “ Euphrates Shield. ” Turkish troops and Ankara-backed “ moderate rebels ” encountered little resistance at first , but bogged down in attempts to capture the key city of Al-Bab .
Another Turkish objective was to prevent the Kurdish forces east of the Euphrates from linking up with their compatriots in the Afrin district , who are allied with Syrian government forces and have been instrumental in last year 's liberation of Aleppo .
Turkish forces finally took Al-Bab on February 24 , but quickly found their way towards Raqqa blocked by Syrian government troops , which linked up with the US-backed “ Syrian Democratic Forces ” ( SDF ) on Monday . The SDF includes several Arab tribal militias , but Kurds make up the bulk of its combat forces .
The SDF has been advancing on Raqqa since November 2016 . In recent weeks , they 've been aided by airstrikes from Russian bombers , coordinated with the US through “ deconfliction ” arrangements .
Townsend also told reporters it was less important who took Raqqa than who ends up administering the city after its liberation . The Obama administration said last year that it expected “ outside forces ” to withdraw from Raqqa and leave it to local Arab forces . The same arrangement was supposed to happen in Manbij , an Arab-majority city liberated from IS last August . Turkey has repeatedly demanded that the SDF vacate Manbij , which the Kurds have refused to do .
I talk a lot in this column about how graduate programs might be run differently . The graduate enterprise faces a lot of problems , so there 's plenty to talk about . But I do n't run a graduate program , and we do n't hear enough from the people who do .
There 's a reason for that . Administrators ca n't dissociate themselves from their institutions when they speak . As any administrator will tell you , even the most casual remark can become the object of Kremlinological scrutiny and speculation .
With that concern in mind , I recently conducted an email interview with a dean who works with graduate education in the arts and sciences at a well-endowed private institution—let 's call it Very Good University . He 's a full professor who came up through the faculty ranks and was named a dean less than a decade ago . Because I 've shielded their identity here , they were able to offer some bracing observations and sound prescriptions . Here is our exchange .
What sorts of changes would you like to see in American graduate study ?
The biggest one is that our doctoral curricula need to be changed to acknowledge what has been true for a long time , which is that most of our Ph.D. students do not end up in tenure-track ( or even full-time faculty ) positions—and that many of those who do will be at institutions that are very , very different from the places where these Ph.D. 's are trained .
The changes will differ from program to program but might include different kinds of coursework , exams , and even dissertation structures . Right now we train students for the professoriate , and if something else works out , that 's fine . We can serve our students and our society better by realizing their diverse futures and changing the training we offer accordingly .
The other necessary change : We need to think seriously about the cost of graduate education . There is a perception that graduate students are simply a cheap labor force for the university , and that universities are interested in graduate students only because they perform work as teachers and laboratory assistants cheaper than any one else .
At elite universities—or at least at elite private ones—that is simply not true , and I am glad that it is not . It is absolutely true that graduate students perform labor necessary for the university in a number of ways , but it is not cheap labor , nor should it be .
The cost of graduate education has repercussions for the humanities and social sciences , which is one reason you are seeing smaller admissions numbers and some program closings . It also has repercussions for the laboratory sciences , where I am seeing too many faculty members shift from taking on graduate students to hiring postdocs . Unfortunately , they regard postdocs as a less expensive and more stable alternative to graduate students , and postdocs come without the same burdens of education or job placement that otherwise fall on the faculty member who hires doctoral students .
I want to underline that I do n't think that graduate programs should be cheaper , but we ca n't have an honest conversation about their future unless we acknowledge their cost .

What might those changes look like at your medium-size private university ?
I am not sure . If I were , I 'd be writing a white paper for the dean of our graduate school rather than talking with you . They would probably include coursework designed to prepare doctoral students for nonacademic careers , internship options , and even multiple dissertation options .
I have a sense of what this could look like in my own discipline , but this needs to be a collective conversation . Anyone can chart out a `` vision '' and write it up for The Chronicle . It 's another thing altogether to make it work , starting from the ground up , at one 's own university with the enthusiastic support of everyone involved . For that to happen , there needs to be sustained , open dialogue about the real challenges . And most administrators and faculty are unwilling to engage in that work in a serious way until they see examples of similar changes in the very top programs in their fields .
Why does this kind of change have to start from the top ?
Both faculty and administrators are extremely sensitive to the hierarchies of prestige that drive the academy . In most fields , the majority of faculty members who populate research universities have graduated from a handful of top programs—and they spend the rest of their careers trying to replicate those programs , get back to them , or both . They are worried about doing anything that diverges from what those top programs do , and will argue strongly that divergences place them at a competitive disadvantage in both recruiting and placing graduate students .
Administrators are just as much to blame as faculty for that state of collective anxiety . No matter what deans , provosts , and presidents say , we all rely too heavily on rankings and other comparative metrics that play directly into these conservative dynamics .
Is this a version of the `` mini-me syndrome , '' in which advisers try to mold their graduate students in their own image , writ large ?
That is certainly part of it . The desire to see your own scholarly passions continue through students you have trained is truly powerful , and administrators underestimate that desire at their peril . Of course we all want our faculty members to be passionate about their research , and graduate training is one way that faculty research makes an impact on the profession . But there are moments when the desire for scholarly replication can be troubling . The training of graduate students should fill a greater need than our personal desire for a legacy .
Graduate school is where we all become socialized into the academic profession . It sets the template for our expectations of what it means to be an academic . No matter how many years go by , most of us hold certain ideals in our mind and think graduate training should be based on those experiences .
And we build and run our programs accordingly ?

Right . Faculty members often try to either recreate a graduate program that they attended or carve out their own institutional training ground by creating a new center . Even as the number of academic positions has receded over the past five years , the administration here has been bombarded with requests for new graduate programs .
Administrators , again , are not blameless in that dynamic . We overvalue new programs , centers , and so on , as a way of being able to tell a progressive story of institutional growth . Every research university trumpets `` the new '' loudly . No press release ever comes out and says , `` We 're doing things the same way as last year , because it is all working so well ! ''
The focus on vaguely defined `` excellence '' contributes to that behavior , because there is nothing to define `` excellence '' beyond the hierarchies that are already in place .
Administrators are worried about lookingtoo different from their peers or from the institutions with which they would like to compare themselves . As much as they might talk about innovation or disruption , they are worried that if they look too different , they wo n't be playing the right game . Of course , that also means that they will never actually leapfrog into the top , because we are all trying to do the same thing .
That makes you more conservative in your own job ?
Let 's just say I wish I were more creative and ambitious . On the other hand , I share my faculty 's skepticism of wide-eyed visionaries who do n't appreciate the real complexities and challenges that we are facing .
You say that professors are too defensive and afraid of innovation . What do you mean ? Can you give an example or two ?
Faculty members are too quick to experience any proposed change as a loss . That is especially true in humanities fields , where the `` crisis of the humanities '' has made faculty nervous and defensive . This temperament has made it difficult to take seriously proposals that could actually help sustain the programs they care about .
For instance , as cohorts get smaller in certain doctoral programs , it makes sense to think about combining them—to create both a broader intellectual community and better administrative support . But most faculty members fear that kind of move—even if it could result in a newly defined and exciting intellectual community . They think it would erode the particular discipline to which they have devoted themselves .
Two other examples : First , nearly every private-university administrator I talk with says that the current state of language instruction is not sustainable . Most campuses think that they can not continue to teach the languages they are teaching at their current levels while meeting expanding student demands in new fields ( including languages that are more recently arrived in the curriculum ) . This is going to require some innovative and integrative solutions if we are going to provide graduate training in many fields , but the same administrators will tell you that it is hard to work with professors to resolve those problems , because they are so afraid of losing what they have now .
Second , we all know that we should change our graduate curricula across the board—from the laboratory sciences to the humanities—to reflect the fact that a diminishing number of our Ph.D. 's will work in tenure-track jobs . But how many departments have changed their requirements , introduced new classes , or rethought the structure of their dissertations ?
Everyone is afraid that they will lose something by doing so , either because it will mean less time for their students in the lab or library , or because it will make their students less competitive , or because it will be interpreted by prospective recruits as an admission of weakness .
The long and short of what you say is that the conservatism of tenured faculty—which they learn from their tenured advisers before them—is hurting graduate students badly . It locks them into curricula and expectations that ill suit their prospects in today 's world . How can we break out of this cycle ?
It 's not a cycle that we can break , but a structure that has limitations . We certainly can serve both our graduate students and our society better . Experimentation and innovation could have a significant effect , and small groups of tenured faculty members and administrators have the power to make these changes . The biggest barrier is our own collective fears and self-imposed conservatism .
But I see reasons for optimism . For example , the discussion of tracking Ph.D. placement in The Chronicle ( and elsewhere ) will have very healthy effects , and I think it is possible that we can , and should , create a future with a greater diversity of graduate programs , even if there are slightly fewer of them .
I also believe that the majority of faculty members who received their Ph.D. 's in the past 10 years are likely to take for granted that these changes are inevitable , and even desirable . For all of the challenges we 've discussed , graduate education will be a necessary and vital component of the research university for at least , say , the next half-century . And I 'm stopping there only because to go farther out than that is science fiction .
As we focus on the challenges , let 's not forget that our current model of graduate training has been the source of tremendous creativity and innovation . For all the pessimism running through our conversation , the research university is still the most interesting , productive institution in American contemporary life—and what we have built in the American academy is truly remarkable . There 's no other place I 'd rather be .
About
`` Kek '' is a translation of the acronym `` LOL '' ( laugh out loud ) when reading text written by members of the Horde faction as an Alliance player in the online multiplayer game World of Warcraft ( WoW ) . “ Kek ” is also associated with the unrelated Turkish snack food Topkek , which is often discussed on the /s4s/ ( Shit 4chan Says ) board on 4chan .
Origin
The term has its origins in the Korean language , as the onomatopoeia ㅋㅋㅋ , in which ㅋ stands for the `` k '' sounds , like in raspy , stifled laughter . In the real-time strategy game Starcraft , because the game originally did not support the Korean language , the onomatopoeia was written as `` Kekeke '' which can be translated to `` Hahaha '' in English .
In the online multiplayer role-playing game WoW , released on November 23rd , 2004 , players can choose to play on either the Alliance or Horde factions , which are considered enemies within the game 's universe . Players of separate factions are unable to communicate with one-another , as their typed text is run through an in-game translator . For players of the Horde faction , typing the letters `` LOL '' results in members of the Alliance faction reading `` KEK '' .
Spread
On March 22nd , 2005 , Urban Dictionary user drat submitted an entry for the word “ kek , ” defining it as “ 'lol ' in Orcish. ” On June 19th , 2007 , Yahoo Answers member Mr. Questionair submitted a question about cross-faction communication , to which user ArcadianStormcrow replied that when Horde players speak the word “ lol , ” it shows up as “ kek ” for Alliance players . On April 4th , 2008 , a thread was submitted to the Gamespot Forums which included mentions of “ kek ” and “ lol ” among other faction translations . On June 24th , 2009 , Wow Insider published an article on communicating with enemies , noting that saying “ kek ” as an Alliance player will not translate as “ lol ” to a Horde player . On February 16th , 2010 , Wowhead Forums member sistereinstein submitted a thread asking if “ kek ” was a new slang term for “ LOL. ” On September 2nd , 2011 , an entry for “ kek ” was submitted to the slang website Internet Slang , defining it as “ LOL in WOW . ”
Topkek
Topkek is a brand of Turkish cake which is often combined with the neologism `` Top Lel '' associated with the Top Gun hat worn by the character Adam in the American sitcom Workaholics . According to Encyclopedia Dramatica , Topkek became notable on the /s4s/ board on May 13th , 2013 , when user prime minister face began posting photographs of the snack food .
On June 5th , a Facebook page titled `` Top kek '' was launched . On July 12th , 2013 , Redditor glnskp submitted a screenshot of a Topkek 4chan thread to the /r/4chan subreddit , to which several Redditors replied with references to WoW . On the following day , YouTuber Top Kek uploaded a When I 'm Bored remix video titled `` When I 'm kek '' featuring a slideshow containing Topkek images ( shown below ) .
Cult of Kek
The Cult of Kek , also known as the Church of Kek , is a satirical religion based around the worship of the ancient Egyptian deity Kek ( also spelled Kuk or Keku ) , an androgynous God of darkness and chaos who is often depicted as a frog or frog-headed man in male form or a snake-headed woman in female form . On 4chan , the character Pepe the Frog is often considered a modern avatar of the diety , who uses ancient Egyptian meme magic to influence the world , often by fulfilling the wishes of posts that end in repeating numbers .

Texas is n't generally considered a great place to surf , but there are good waves to be found if you know when and where to look . Photographer Kenny Braun is one of those people . “ Surprisingly there are many people in Texas who do n't even know there are beaches in Texas , much fewer surfers , ” they said via email . “ I think most people still associate Texas with either the cowboy or Dallas although , in reality , I think that there are probably more surfers than cowboys in Texas . And a few cowboys who surf as well . ”
Braun started surfing in the mid-1970s . They grew up in Houston , where the beach was about 1 ½ hours away . In 2000 , Braun started photographing their friends , family , and fellow surfers . Their book , Surf Texas , is a beautiful document of a little-known culture .

Surfing in Texas is n't always easy . During the summer , when most people travel to the beach , there are little to no waves at all . The best waves usually occur during the spring , fall , or winter , and even then , conditions are hit or miss . But many surfers in Texas are n't deterred . “ Surfers all over the planet share the same love for the sport regardless of whether they are in Hawaii or Sheboygan , Wisconsin on Lake Michigan ( the Malibu of the Midwest ) . Wherever you find rideable waves you find dedicated and passionate surfers , ” Braun said .
Usually , the best surf breaks in Texas are found near structures like piers and jetties . The water can range from murky brown on the northern coast in Galveston to clear blue-green on South Padre Island , where one can find the most consistent waves . Some surfers in Texas , however , skip natural waves altogether and ride the wakes of oil tankers . “ For tanker surfing , Galveston Bay is perfectly shaped geographically . Fully loaded oil tankers come steaming in at full speed and travel approximately 30 miles before entering the Houston Ship Channel . The ship 's wake produces a beautiful shoulder high wave that can be ridden for 20 minutes . The average ocean wave ride is 20 seconds , ” Braun said . “ James Fulbright was one of the first pioneers of tanker surfing in Galveston 16 years ago and they take people out on their chartered boat . They and their friends were the ones featured in Dana Brown 's surf film , Step Into Liquid . They were also the ones who took me out for the pictures in my book . ”

A challenge for most surf photographers is trying to be at the right place at the right time . Braun prefers sitting on their surfboard where the waves are breaking so they can catch surfers dropping into them . For their book , they shot with a few cameras including a Holga , a disposable waterproof 35mm , a digital point-and-shoot , and a DSLR .
Braun lives in Austin , and the closest beach is three hours away , which makes planning a surfing trip—and photographing a book about surfing—difficult . Often , when a good swell would be rolling in , Braun would have other commitments . They wanted to photograph a good hurricane swell for the book , which proved elusive until Hurricane Isaac in 2012 . But that did n't bother them too much . Like many Texas surfers , he 's used to waiting . “ One has to watch the weather and water conditions in order to time out the best surf in Texas . And even though the surf gets quite good at times , it usually does n't last that long , so being there when the conditions are just right is rare , especially for land-locked surfers like me . But when you do it is very rewarding , ” they said

This book attempts to give a historical account of the development of marxism as a philosophy of science as well as a philosophical account of the issues involved . It encompasses the 1st 100 years of the existence of marxism , beginning with the mid-1840s when the philosophical ideas of Marx and Engels began to emerge in mature form , and ending with the mid-1940s with the dissolution of the Comintern and the end of WW2 .
It deals with both the mainstream of the marxist tradition in the development of dialectical materialism as a philosophy of science and with diverging currents advocating alternative philosophical positions . It shows the marxist tradition to be far more complex and differentiated than is usually imagined , characterised by sharp and lively controversies for contending paths of development at every step of the way .
Essentially this work is about the shifting nexus of science , philosophy and politics within marxism . It examines the multiplicity of factors coming into play , including the impact of new scientific discoveries , new philosophical trends and new political formations upon the overall process .
Among the most important philosophical issues arising are : the formation of world view vis-a-vis the process of scientific discovery ; the relationship between dialectical materialism and communism ; the notion of proletarian science ; the concept of the dialectics of nature .
As the work is unique , insofar as there is no other history of marxist philosophy of science covering the whole period in question , it abounds in original research and original conclusions . Where there is a body of secondary literarature in existence , with respect to specific authors or specific periods , it surveys this literature and takes a specific interpretive position . On a number of matters of ongoing controvery , such as the Marx-Engels relationship and the relationship of the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis on the origin of life to marxist philosophy , a definite position is argued .
The overall conclusion reached by the book is that this is a rich and significant history , rooted in the impulse to work out a philosophical world view grounded in the most advanced science of its day and integrally connected to the struggle to revolutionise its social matrix and to create a socialist social order .
An audacious enterprise , it generated not only impressive achievements , but also tragic disasters . It is a history with a dark side as well as a bright one . An effort is made to see both in proper perspective .

A Baltimore Raven , in a Florida jail . Safety Matt Elam , was arrested in Miami Beach Saturday night . He 's facing marijuana and drug charges .
The Ravens were considering whether to keep them on the team . Their arrest , helped them make the final call .
They had previously been suspended for violating the NFL 's substance-abuse policy in 2015 .
Matt Elam 's days as a Baltimore raven are numbered . The team , making the call , after their arrest in Miami . A spokesperson saying quote : “ We are aware of the arrest of matt Elam . Matt is not in our plans for the 2017 Ravens . ”
Ravens fans we spoke to are disappointed .
“ I think it 's disheartening . It 's devastating , ” says Myesha Brooks .
Charging documents obtained by WJZ , say detectives saw Elam driving their Range Rover at high speeds on Miami 's Pine Tree Drive . They were seen swerving in and out of lanes , and almost colliding with other cars . Elam , allegedly ignored police sirens and tried to speed away before coming to a stop . Officers noticed an intense smell of burning marijuana and a cloud of smoke coming from the truck .
They discovered a Gucci bookbag on the driver 's side , containing Elam 's identification . It was packed with 126 grams of marijuana and 3 grams of oxycodone , more than $ 900 in cash , a Rolex and a gold necklace .
The 25-year-old , Florida-native , was with three other passengers . Police say one of them had a loaded gun without a permit . Elam was arrested and charged with drug possession , intent to sell , and reckless driving .
“ If he 's breaking the law , which it sounds like they did , then they should be held accountable , ” says Jamaar Moore .
Elam was not expected to return to the team once their contract expires . The arrest is a violation of the league 's code of conduct .
“ There was enough on them at the time to say okay we 're done with him , so I think they made the right the decision , ” says Ian Jones , Ravens fan .
Their bail was set at $ 15,500 . The passengers in the car were also arrested . Elam signed with the ravens in 2013 . They were a first-round-draft-pick .

Ultimately , the graphics and paltry creativity in the story lead to the game 's downfall . The lack of detail in the third-person perspective and cut scenes is a martyr to gameplay . The game is formatted as an “ open world ” so you have all of Manhattan Island to roam via Spider-Man 's trusty web . The monstrous scale of that world leads to reduced quality in the graphics ; there is a limit to how much data game consoles can process , and they reached it .
Perfectly timed with the release of the revamped Spider-Man movie franchise , Beenox games has come out with another Spidey game . The Amazing Spider-Man makes a heroic attempt to sidestep the stereotype of games derived from blockbuster movies : games hastily put together only to hype the upcoming film . Though the final product is vastly superior to past Spider-Man instalments , it simply is n't as amazing as the title claims .
Despite the poor visual renderings , the game is a blast to play . Manhattan skyscrapers are at your disposal and you can soar over the rooftops with beautifully choreographed dives , spins and flips . It 's exhilarating as your blue and red two-legged spider soars over the Chrysler Building and plummets all the way down to the bustling city streets — and catches themselves just before the ground . It 's enough of a selling point for any fan of the Marvel comic book hero , both past and present .
The story is loosely based on the Hollywood flick released earlier this week and is , in some cases , too similar ; you 'll find out who wo n't be in the Spidey sequel . So diehard fans should beware of spoilers and see the movie before playing .
Where the game 's storyline deviates from the movie is the incorporation of Oscorp 's nanotechnology branch , which includes an army of flying killing machines that are sent around New York to exterminate all the cross-species , including Spider-Man . The basic plot line contains the same engineered human-animal cross breeds and animals that have escaped from the technology conglomerate “ Oscorp. ” These hybrid beasts are not quite as cheerful or well dressed as the joke-cracking Spider-Man ; they 're a more ill-tempered half-rat .
The game 's main missions flow relatively well , though you find yourself constantly repeating manoeuvres or tactics . The only difference is in the landscape ; the same villains and pesky robots turn up countless times .
New features include “ web rush mode , ” which freezes time and lets you plan your next jump or web swing . The web rush is a creative way of controlling your seemingly wild leaps from building to building , and useful when Peter Parker 's alter ego is overwhelmed by enemies .
Unfortunately , these days games ca n't survive off merely being fun to play . With the potential for graphics to be so advanced , not to mention the growing importance of a diverse and intricate plot , even with Spider-Man 's wall-climbing grip , The Amazing Spider-Man dropped the ball .

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman does not want them
Saphir Taider is set to leave Southampton three weeks after arriving on a season-long loan .
The 22-year-old midfielder joined on 6 August from Internazionale , with a view to signing permanently .
The deal saw Southampton 's record signing Dani Osvaldo go the other way , although Taider 's spell at St Mary 's has been even more farcical than the Italy international 's .
It is understood the midfielder , an unused substitute in all three of Southampton 's matches , is to head back to Italy having failed to settle in England .
Taider did not fit into the group of players or the manager Ronald Koeman 's worth ethic , meaning they are packing their bags after just three weeks .
The Algeria international is reportedly set to complete a move to the Serie A side Sassuolo , although their departure does not affect Osvaldo 's loan deal at San Siro .
Story highlights The Security Council holds its first substantive debate on the issue
The Palestinian Authority hopes the application will be accepted
The U.N. General Assembly could vote to upgrade the status of Palestinians
The body change the Palestinians to a permanent observer `` state ''
A U.N. committee will issue a report on its analysis of the historic Palestinian bid for statehood in two weeks , the Security Council president said Friday .
The announcement by Lebanese U.N . Ambassador Nawaf Salam , who holds the rotating Security Council presidency for September , came after the Council held its first substantive debate on the application since it was submitted by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
Several diplomats said after the meeting that there is a consensus about the need to deal with the matter swiftly and seriously .
`` It was a good meeting , '' said British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant . `` We set out our positions , mainly on procedural issues , but some substantive . ''
If a committee majority says the prospective Palestinian state fulfills the U.N. charter 's requirements , it will send the application back to the full Security Council for a vote .
The Palestinians would then need nine of 15 votes in their favor , and no veto from any of the five countries that are permanent members of the council .
U.S. officials have vowed to block the measure , though they most likely want to avoid an American veto out of concern over a potential backlash across the Middle East .
The General Assembly , however , could still vote to upgrade the status of Palestinians , who currently hold the status of nonvoting observer `` entity . '' The body could change that status to permanent observer `` state , '' identical to the Vatican 's standing at the United Nations .
U.S. President Barack Obama has said they support Palestinian statehood but has remained steadfast to a longstanding U.S. position that Israel must be part of the discussions .
Abbas ' effort to gain U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state is also opposed by Hamas , the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza .
It has warned the Palestinian leader against making the request , saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel , which would `` deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland . ''
Despite the push in New York , negotiations remain the preferred option for the Palestinian Authority going forward , according to Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat , who said Israel 's refusal to halt settlement activity and accept 1967 lines as the starting point for talks make the resumption of dialogue impossible .
The Palestinians claim the land Israel occupied in East Jerusalem and the West Bank after the 1967 war as part of a future Palestinian state .
`` We 're asking the Israeli government to say in any language -- Arabic , Hebrew , English , Chinese , French , '' Erakat said Thursday after a meeting of the PLO executive committee . `` Netanyahu please say it -- two states on 1967 lines for Palestine to live side by side with the state of Israel . If they can not utter these numbers and these words , what do they want to do with me ? ''
But Netanyahu has said the Palestinians are looking for a `` state without peace , '' ignoring security concerns important to Israel .
They said Palestinians are armed not only with their `` hopes and dreams '' -- a phrase Abbas used in a September 23 speech before the U.N. General Assembly -- but with `` 10,000 missiles , and Grad rockets supplied by Iran , not to mention the river of lethal weapons flowing into Gaza . ''
`` Palestinians should first make peace with Israel and then get their state , '' Netanyahu said as they followed Abbas to the rostrum , adding that peace must arrive through a two-state solution that recognizes Israel as a Jewish state .
If that occurs , Israel `` will be the first '' to recognize Palestinian statehood , the prime minister said .
Lower-level envoys from the Security Council members will meet again on the issue next week , according to Ambassador Salam .

When it comes to spending time with their kids these days , dads have a lot of competition from smartphones and tablets . It seems many kids would rather have their faces buried in their screens than spend some face time with the man who brought them into the world .
Canadian advertising agency Grip Limited has a solution -- a tie that hijacks your home 's WiFi signal and reroutes it so that it 's only effective within ten feet of the wearer . When dad has it on , the kids in the house will have no choice but to get closer to their father if they want to continue surfing . It 's called , logically enough -- TieFi ( a mashup of Tie and WiFi ) .
Ah , home life in the 21st century . So sweet .
`` With this particular product , I think you might have missed the point , '' says the family doctor who 's interviewed in the video about TieFi ( see below ) . But of course , that 's the entire point of the Grip Limited invention , video and accompanying website . The mock campaign was developed to point out just how absurd it 's getting that fathers might have to resort to this kind of measure to get their kids close to them .
Even though the TieFi was developed to get this point across ( and draw some attention to Grip Unlimited , no doubt ) , the website does actually let you download the instructions for making one yourself at home . You 'll need a Raspberry Pi , external battery , micro SD card and a few other bits of gear , but if you 're a dad and things really are desperate in your home , you could give it a try .
Or , you could just what my father would have done were I still a bratty kid putting my iPad before my dad -- cancel your home 's WiFi subscription . That 'll teach 'em !

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered their ministers to accelerate efforts to deport citizens of South Sudan , the Ivory Coast , Ghana and Ethiopia who are living in Israel illegally on Sunday .
Speaking at Sunday 's cabinet meeting , Netanyahu said that while it is not possible to expel citizens of Eritrea and Sudan , whose lives would be at risk in their home countries , holding facilities for them must be built in the Negev as quickly as possible .
A senior Israeli official said that two different groups of migrants were presented during Sunday 's cabinet debate . The first was migrants from countries with which Israel has diplomatic relations , and with regard to whom there is no barrier to repatriating them under international law , they said . This group numbers some 25,000 of the approximately 60,000 African migrants now in Israel .
The second group comprises migrants from Eritrea , Sudan and Somalia , who can not be repatriated because their lives would be at risk , according to the official . This group comprises some 35,000 people .
Sudan is classified as an enemy country , another reason that migrants ca n't be returned there , they said , while Eritrea , though it has diplomatic relations with Israel , considers those who fled the country to be AWOL soldiers , and upon their return home they could be severely punished . Eritrea has a mandatory conscription law for all men aged 17-45 , and demands reserve duty up to age 55 . There are no exemptions .
With regard to the first group of migrants , Netanyahu said , `` Whoever can be sent away should be sent away from here as quickly as possible . ''
With regard to the second group , they said , `` It 's clear that we can not return Sudanis and Eritreans to their countries . ''

During the cabinet debate , Netanyahu appeared impatient and dissatisfied with the conduct of the relevant ministries and banged on the table several times , according to sources who were present . They ordered a substantial expansion of the Saharonim lockup in the Negev so that it could hold the tens of thousands of people who ca n't be repatriated .
They also ordered a team of interrogators puts together to interview all those who will be brought to the Saharonim facility to determine whether they are indeed entitled to refugee status .
The Foreign Ministry has been conducting intensive discussions for several months with the governments of those countries whose citizens can be repatriated , a senior ministry source said .
For example , Israel is exerting heavy pressure on Ethiopia to begin returning its citizens who are in Israel illegally . Ethiopian diplomats have visited the Saharonim facility and interviewed Ethiopian nationals .
The Foreign Ministry has also been in regular contact with South Sudan , whose nationals are being given a chance to return voluntarily . On June 17 a plane carrying some 200 South Sudanese will fly from Israel to Juba , the South Sudan capital . In mid-July there will be another plane of South Sudanese who agreed to leave but asked to do so after the school year ends .
A senior Foreign Ministry source said that Israel has made it clear to countries like the Ivory Coast and Ghana that the government plans to deport their nationals , by force if necessary , and that if their governments do n't issue the migrants travel documents , then Israel will do so .
`` We told them , 'Either we do this together , or we will just put them on planes by ourselves , ' '' the senior official said .
The Foreign Ministry also said that over the past five years it has approached third countries to ascertain whether any of them would be willing to accept refugees from Eritrea or Sudan . Israeli diplomats were in touch with 30 African countries and 10 Western countries but were categorically refused .
`` All the African states and many European ones are dealing with the same problem , '' a senior source said . `` Everyone to whom we addressed a request slammed the door in our faces . ''

With just over two years to go before the completion of the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan , insider attacks on U.S. and coalition troops have risen to an all-time high . So far in 2012 , 37 separate attacks by Afghan soldiers and police have left 53 troops dead in so-called “ green on blue ” incidents- those where coalition forces are attacked by a member of the Afghan security forces- including two this weekend . The pace of green-on-blue attacks has accelerated sharply : between 2007 and 2009 , just 14 coalition troops fell victim to insider attacks , but since 2010 , according to a tally by The Guardian , 106 coalition troops were killed in 63 attacks .
Another study , this one by the New America Foundation , identified 116 killed and 88 wounded in green-on-blue attacks since 2003 . Meanwhile , Reuters estimates that insider attacks account for 20 % of all combat related deaths that coalition forces have suffered in 2012 .
The rising pattern of green-on-blue incidents has set off alarm bells from Kabul to Washington and London . By mid-summer the attacks had already reached epidemic proportions , when a string of attacks left 10 U.S. troops dead in a two-week span , after which the chairperson of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen. Martin Dempsey , traveled to Kabul to meet with senior commanders and Afghan officials to discuss what was emerging as a crisis .
By August , a series of emergency steps had been implemented to reduce or eliminate insider attacks , according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank . Among them , stricter vetting of Afghan recruits , beefed-up counterintelligence teams , mandatory interviews for Afghan soldiers returning from leave , a new “ warning and reporting system for insider threats , ” including a process for anonymous tips , and more . Still , in early September , U.S. Special Operations forces suspended training the particularly troublesome Afghan Local Police ( ALP ) after the August 17 shooting death of two American special ops troops by ALP members .
Anthony Cordesman , the veteran CSIS military analyst , said in the report that “ green on blue and other politically oriented strikes on both foreign and Afghan targets may be giving the insurgents back the overall momentum in the war. ” That is true , they pointed out , even though it is n't clear how many insider attacks are Taliban-inspired , and how many result from personal grudges and grievances or generalized anger against the U.S./ISAF coalition on the part of Afghan forces .
Lineup construction is overrated , but do n't tell me that when I 'm shifting my OOTP ( that 's Out of the Park , a baseball simulation , for the uninitiated ) lineup around . Therein lies the misconception about batting orders : small changes are believed to yield dramatic run improvements . In reality , they probably do n't .
Joe Maddon is going to bat Kyle Schwarber leadoff , which presumably moves Ben Zobrist to the cleanup spot . Unless , of course , Addison Russell rockets to superstardom this year . Maddon also said they were tinkering with the idea of batting the pitcher 8th again , just like many of their 2015 lineups .
As I was almost done preparing the initial substance of this post , Brian Kenny was coincidentally leading a conversation on MLB Network about Schwarber leading off . Kenny 's panel did not like slotting a power RBI bat in the leadoff spot . To these MLB Network people , batting Schwarber at the top of the order is a waste of power . Their opinions are shared by many Cubs fans , too , and I understand the thinking .
But does batting Schwarber leadoff actually translate to less run production for the Cubs ? I simulated a few lineups to see if a Schwarer leadoff scenario hurts the Cubs , and I also simulated batting the pitcher 8th in the process .
How , you might ask , did I simulate different lineups ? Well , I tried to include sequencing in order to achieve the most accurate results , but keep in mind its unpredictability is extremely challenging to model . So I scaled the number of runs created by each Cubs player according to the number of plate appearances accumulated by each slot in the team 's 2016 batting order . I then assigned a “ sequencing weight , ” which is basically a number that factors in the probability that a batter will be up with men on base .
Here are the results :
A win is worth about 9-10 runs . While batting Schwarber leadoff might add an additional 8 runs , the outcome amounts to slightly less than a win . Factor in the unpredictability of baseball and this run difference is essentially negligible .
What I found particularly interesting is that there is practically no difference between batting the pitcher 8th or 9th . Maddon could utilize this to their advantage in several ways .
First , batting Albert Almora 9th means the center fielder would theoretically face more pitches inside the strike zone than if they were to bat a spot higher . Maddon said they batted Russell last in 2015 to increase the likelihood that he 'd face more hittable pitches . The concept would be the same here , to spur Almora 's development by placing them in situations that yield the best pitches . Second , since there were 23 more men on base for the 8th hitter than for the 9th in 2016 , the Cubs could utilize a pinch hitter who is actually better than Almora .
I do n't really care if Schwarber bats first or cleanup because the difference is almost nill . On the other hand , since there is also no difference between batting the pitcher in either of the two bottom spots , batting Almora last might allow them to progress quicker because they should see better pitches to hit .
'No one saw this coming ' – or did they ?
Dirk Bezemer
Did economists not see this crisis coming ? This column says that analysts who used models featuring a distinct financial sector issued fairly detailed , well reasoned , and public warnings of imminent finance turmoil . It argues that mainstream models missed the crisis because they use a “ reflective finance ” view in which financial variables are wholly determined by the real sector . “ Flow of funds ” models may be the way forward for anticipating finance-induced recessions .
From the very beginning of the credit crisis and the ensuing recession , it has become conventional wisdom that `` no one saw this coming '' . Anatole Kaletsky ( 2008 ) wrote in the The Times of “ those who failed to foresee the gravity of this crisis - a group that includes Mr King , Mr Brown , Alistair Darling , Alan Greenspan and almost every leading economist and financier in the world. ” Glenn Stevens ( 2008 ) , Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia , said :
“ I do not know anyone who predicted this course of events . This should give us cause to reflect on how hard a job it is to make genuinely useful forecasts . What we have seen is truly a ‘ tail ' outcome – the kind of outcome that the routine forecasting process never predicts . But it has occurred , it has implications , and so we must reflect on it ” .
We must indeed .
What now for economic modelling ?
One result from such reflection would be that in fact , many had predicted this course of events for years . In a recent study ( Bezemer 2009 ) , I document the economists who did “ see it coming ” . At least a dozen serious analysts issued fairly detailed , well reasoned , and public warnings of imminent finance-induced recession .
They were apparently ignored by Stevens and other central bankers who then , as Alan Greenspan professed in their October 2008 testimony , watched with “ shocked disbelief ” as their “ whole intellectual edifice collapse in the summer [ of 2007 ] ” . The official models they relied on missed the crisis not because the conditions were so unusual , as we are often told . They missed it by design .
It is impossible to warn against a debt deflation recession in a model world where debt does not exist . This is the world in which our policymakers have been living , and they urgently need to change habitat . The question that the economics profession now needs to address is – whereto ? If our routine forecasting models – CGE models , mostly – failed to foresee this , where do we look for alternatives ?
The types of models that got it right
In Bezemer ( 2009 ) , I document the models that got it right . The important question for economists is – how did they do it ? What is the underlying model ?
While there is obviously a diversity of approaches , one important strand of thinking is an accounting of financial stocks ( debt and wealth ) and flows ( of credit , interest , profit and wages ) , as well as explicit analysis of both the real economy and the financial sector ( including property ) .
The most detailed of these models , which has also been used to construct public projections and analyses , are “ Flow of Funds ” models of the US developed by Wynne Godley and associates at the Levy Economics Institute . These may serve as pars pro toto for the class of “ Flow of Funds ” models of real-financial interactions ( e.g . also Werner , 1997 ; Graziani , 2003 ; Hudson , 2006 ; Keen , 2009 ) . A simplified ( closed-economy ) representation in Godley ( 1999 ) consists of stocks and flows of a number of asset classes between four sectors ( explicitly separating out the financial sector ) , with their properties and interrelations represented in over 60 equations ( Table 1 ; see Godley 1999 for all symbols ) .
Table 1 . The flow of funds in matrix representation
Source : Godley ( 1999:395 )
Flow of funds models
In “ Flow of Funds ” models , liquidity generated in the financial sector flows to firms , households and the government as they borrow . This may facilitate fixed-capital investment and production , but it may also feed asset price inflation , consumption , and debt growth . Liquidity returns to the financial sector as financial investments or in payment of debt service and financial fees . Key features of “ Flow of Funds ” models are thus bank credit flows , since “ evolving finance in the form of bank loans is required if production is to be financed … ” ( Godley , 1999:405 ) . Also , there are explicit payment flows such as interest , “ not quite the same as in the national accounts , where it is standard practice… to ignore interest payments , although they are an inevitable cost given that production takes time ” ( Godley , 1999:405 ) .
The model is solved by imposing macro accounting identities and adaptive expectations rather than individual optimisation . There is a steady state but not equilibrium . One advantage is that growth paths can be identified as unsustainable given the existing “ bedrock ” accounting relations . This allowed Godley and Wray in 2000 to conclude that “ Goldilocks was doomed ” – with a government surplus and current account deficit , US economic growth had to be predicated on ongoing and unsustainably high rates of private debt growth .
What 's missing from the mainstream models ?
This inference is impossible to make from national or OECD forecasters ' models , where balance sheet variables or interest flows are conspicuous by their absence . These CGE models do not include a separate financial sector , ruling out finance-induced recession by design . Money supply and interest rate variables are included in those models , but they are fully determined by real-sector variables such as the output gap . Also , the process of money stock growth or asset market inflation – by bank lending which increases debt levels and elicits return flows of interest – are not modelled . This fits in with a “ reflective finance ” view ; the financial sector , rather than developing its own dynamic , is assumed to adapt to the “ real fundamentals ” , so that explicitly modelling it is superfluous .
The contrast with actually existing finance-induced recessions should lead forecasters to reconsider their models . Interestingly , there have been moves in recent years towards including balance sheets and the flow of funds in official models . Rae and Turner ( 2001 ) write that introducing “ alternative assumptions allows a little more economic richness to be temporarily added to the [ OECD Small Global Forecasting ] model when it is used for policy analyses , especially for those situations in which financial markets and expectations play important roles in the transmission of shocks within and between regions ” . In addition to its ad hoc adjustment to the reality of balance sheet effects , the OECD appears to be working on a new “ Interlink ” model , triggered by “ changing conditions ” and including “ domestic and global stock-flow consistency with respect to wealth linkages and wealth effects ” ( Richardson 2006 ) , very similar in name at least to Godley 's “ stock-flow consistent model ” ( Godley and Lavoie 2006 ) .
So far , however , monetary ( and other ) policymakers have resisted inclusion of balance sheets and the flow of funds in their models and policy responses . Greenspan famously preferred to “ mitigate the fallout when it occurs and , hopefully , ease the transition to the next expansion ” . But the underestimation of the severity of the fallout ( global recession ) throws the desirability of the transition to the next expansion into doubt if it is to be driven by debt accumulation . Also , the argument that bubbles can not be timely identified nor their effects reliably anticipated is rebutted by the analysts reviewed in my paper who did both .
Conclusions
While the jury is still out on the question whether CGE models and “ Flow of Funds ” models can be married , exploring these avenues is now urgent . Benjamin Friedman recently noted that , “ what is sorely missing in the discussion is attention to what function the financial system is supposed to perform in the economy and how well it has been doing it ” . “ Flow of Funds ” models provide just that . If the crisis and recession teach us one thing , it is that the financial sector is just as real as the “ real economy ” . We economists – and the policymakers who rely on us – ignore balance sheets and the flow of funds at our peril .

If someone handed you a map of California with the 58 counties outlined and a list of their names could you put the right name within the right boundary ? I could n't and I 'm a historian . I 'd be scratching my head going “ Just where is San Joaquin County ? ”
Recently I got curious about the evolution of California 's counties since I knew in the 1850 's we , as a state , started with 23 and that grew to 58 . Back then many counties covered a huge extent of land due to sparse population . As the state grew in population politicians subdivided counties . Those 1850 's counties included Benicia Sacramento , Mount Diablo , Reading , Sutter Butte , Fremont and Oro .
In 1850 the Report on Committee of Counties was chaired by Mariano Vallejo . The committee heard from locals that Santa Cruz wanted its own county and they got it . County names were changed and Oro became Tuolumne , Solano for Benicia ( Sacramento became its own county ) , Yolo for Fremont and Shasta for Reading . New counties were proposed including Yuba , Colusa , Trinity , Marin and Mendocino . Contra Costa was the new name for Mount Diablo County and Coloma became El Dorado County .
The California Legislature on February 18 , 1850 , in their fifteenth enactment of law , saw the establishment of 27 counties . Boundaries of Sonoma , Solano and Napa counties were indefinite due to a lack of surveys and population . All early counties had Spanish or Native American names with two exceptions . Butte is of French origin and the area was named by French Canadian fur trappers from the Hudson Bay Company who camped along the Sacramento River . Sutter County was named for John Sutter , an early settler .
Saints in the Catholic Church provided the names for seven counties . The prefix San or Santa indicates that . Trinity and Sacramento are names with religious significance . Mendocino 's name honors Antonio de Mendoza , viceroy of New Spain , who financed Juan Cabrillo 's exploration of the coast in the 1530 's . Research says Mendocino is supposedly the adjectival form of the family name .
Gold was signified in the name El Dorado and Contra Costa the “ other side ” from San Francisco across the bay . Mariposa recognizes butterflies in the area , Tulares were reeds growing locally , and Calaveras was for skulls in the area found by explorer Moraga . Fresno was named for ash trees , Alameda for cottonwoods , Madera meant timber and Del Norte was “ of the north. ” Native American place names that became counties included Marin , Napa , Inyo “ Dwelling Place of the Great Spirit , ” Solano , Shasta , Colusa and Stanislaus , a mission educated native who later became a renegade .
In 1855 Humboldt County was named after explorer Alexander Von Humboldt , who never saw the place , when it was split off from Trinity County . Other counties named after people include Glenn , named from wheat farmer Dr. Hugh Glenn and Lassen , named for trapper and frontiersman Peter Lassen . The last county , Imperial , was created in 1907 and named for the Imperial Land Company intent on reclaiming desert lands for agriculture .
There were puzzlers in county names . Siskiyou had several name derivations , none particularly interesting , and Tuolomne may mean “ grove of poplars ” but there is debate . There was no debate when Lake County was created in 1861 . It had a big lake .
I am happy to say after 60+ years of wandering back roads and rockhounding adventures I have visited every county in California . My favorite place to visit is Inyo County because a person can travel from desert to alpine meadows and mountains all within its boundaries . Go up into the White Mountains on the east side of the Owens Valley and look west and the crest of the Sierra will fill your view . While we all love Mendocino County we can explore and appreciate its 57 neighbors from San Bernardino County , the biggest county in the USA with 20,000 square miles , to the smallest in California , Alpine County , with 1,100 folks .
Big Brother is watching you : The town where EVERY car is tracked by police cameras
A sleepy Home Counties market town has become the first in Britain to have every car passing through it tracked by police cameras .
Royston , in Hertfordshire , has had a set of police cameras installed on every road leading in and out of it , recording the numberplate of every vehicle that passes them .
The automatic number-plate recognition system will check the plates against a variety of databases , studying them for links to crimes , and insurance and tax records , and alerting police accordingly .
There were just seven incidents of vehicle crime in the town last month , and residents believe the unmarked cameras are an invasion of their privacy .
Quaint ... and under surveillance : Royston , Hertfordshire is a small town with low-level crime , but is being monitored by the new police system
The system , due to be switched on in the next few days , also allows police to compile 'hotlists ' of vehicles that they are interested in and which will be flagged up when the ANPR system
Details of the cars movements will stay on police records for two years , or five if the car is connected to a crime , the Guardian reported .
The system , which is operated regionally , has sparked fears that the data could be abused and has led to claims that it is a big brother network that the public are completely oblivious of .
Guy Herbert , general secretary from NO2ID , which campaigns against databases storing the public 's details , said : 'It 's very sinister and quite creepy .
'They can approach anyone they like , but there 's no legal basis for them doing so .
'There 's no way to regulate how they use ANPR , they are the authority on it and they have their own rules .
'So there 's no way to protect people 's privacy . '
Mr Herbert also takes issue with the fact that the cameras are not advertised to the motorist , so many are unaware they have even been caught on the camera .
But Inspector Andy Piper , the ANPR manager for Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire , and a Royston resident himself , insists that the system will not be abused .
They told the Guardian : 'We only deal with people we 're interested in stopping - that 's the criminal element that comes into our county intent on committing crime , and unsafe drivers , disqualified drivers , or people driving uninsured vehicles , who we want to take off the road . '
Watching you : The ANPR cameras have been installed in the roads leading in and out of Royston
The ANPR cameras , which are not usually advertised to the public , seem bizarre given Royston 's low level of crime . The town has a population of 15,000 .
Following the most recent meeting of the Royston Neighbourhood Panel , it was decided that the local top priority of speeding should be replaced by shoplifting .
So some have questioned why Hertfordshire Police have taken such measures to track all cars coming in and out of the town , which borders the Cambridgeshire and Essex counties .
Former Royston mayor Rod Kennedy believes the system is targeting the wrong area and details of vehicles should be deleted , unless they have committed a crime or are not registered .
' I just feel that we are on this slippery slope where everything we do will be monitored . I do n't see why the honest citizen in a rural area such as this should have their movements tracked . '
Peaceful : Royston May Fayre , Priory Memorial Gardens , Royston , is a quiet town
But Inspector Piper told the Mail that many businesses were in favour of the system .
'On first sight , the ANPR coverage of such a low crime town as Royston may seem an unusual choice , but ANPR works both as a deterrent and a detection tool .
'The local district council and local business group funded the cameras to help protect their businesses and local residents from crime .
'And when we look at the bigger picture in terms of Hertfordshire , as well as nationally , the position of the cameras makes a lot of sense strategically to target those criminals travelling into the county on the main roads in that area . '
The ANPR system uses a mixture of mobile cameras inside police cars and fixed installations in some locations .
Police argue it helps trace missing people and identify witnesses to help with crimes but James Welch , Legal Director for Liberty , a human rights campaigning group said there needs to be tougher rules to stop it from being vulnerable to misuse .
'ANPR technology captures an identifying marker – a car 's number plate – so has the capability to track and record an individual 's movements far more intrusively than CCTV , ' they said .
'While there may be crime detection gains the potential for abuse is great .
UPDATED WITH GOPHERS-MAVERICKS LINEUP BELOW
Bad night for the Wild and the Houston Aeros in Oklahoma City last night .
Jonas Brodin , a 2011 first-round pick and stud defenseman that would have a chance to make the Wild if the lockout ends , will miss several weeks with a broken clavicle .
Mikael Granlund , a 2010 first-round pick fresh off being named AHL Rookie of the Month , will likely miss a few weeks with a muscle strain in the lower part of their right leg . The Wild will know more possibly later today , but that 's the thinking , hope and look of their situation right now .
To see video of the two incidents , see last night 's blog .
Brodin was nailed in last night 's game by 2011 first overall pick Taylor Hall . Hall received a match penalty for a hit to the head , but Hall contended it was a shoulder to shoulder and Brodin 's injury would seem to verify that . They were supposed to be suspended for tonight 's game , but Sportsnet 's John Shannon reports that the AHL rescinded the match penalty and they are eligible to play tonight ( although they may not ) .
At the very least it was a charge by Hall and at the very least Brodin will be sidelined for a long time pending an examination by Wild doctors .
The plan is for Brodin to come to Minnesota early next week for an MRI to see the extent of the injury . Typically , the standard for an injury like this is six to eight weeks to heal , but GM Chuck Fletcher said doctors need to take a look at pictures to see if it may be quicker or longer .
`` He 's stunned , '' Fletcher said . `` He was kind of shielded on the play . I do n't think they saw Hall coming and it came out of the blue . It 's not good , but broken bones should heal and he 'll get good care . It 's a shame . They were playing so well and getting great experience . ''
As for Granlund , they landed awkwardly after taking a hit in the corner . He 's getting more tests today and was feeling better this morning , but the early indication is they will miss the rest of the weekend and maybe next weekend and hopefully be back in two weeks .
`` You see them go down and think the worst , but this may be relatively good news , '' Fletcher said .
The Aeros rallied from a 3-0 deficit last night to tie it at 3-3 before losing 4-3 . They dominated the game by all accounts , too .
`` Tough loss . But the loss is a lot less significant than the injuries , '' Fletcher said .
Jason Zucker is returning from an injury tonight in Oklahoma City , and they will be centered by Johan Larsson and red-hot Charlie Coyle .
The Aeros are severely banged up on the blue line . Marco Scandella has a wrist injury , although it 's thought to be minor . Kris Fredheim is hurt and likely sidelined another few weeks . The Aeros wanted to recall Kyle Medvec to replace Brodin from ECHL Orlando , but they are hurt . So they turned to an Orlando player named Corbin Baldwin , who is a tough customer that can take care of himself , but he 's not some goon called up in response to last night 's injuries .
That 's what some have painted the recall as , but the Wild has few other defensemen right now . If the Wild wanted to call up a fighter to make a statement , it would have brought in Josh Caron . Baldwin and Sean Lorenz are basically the only D left right now to call up with Medvec hurt , so Baldwin was chosen .
Plus , Granlund 's injury did n't come from a dirty play , and whether you think Hall 's infraction was dirty or not , he 's suspended tonight AND Taylor Hall is not some goon .

While Donald Trump was publicly bragging about being a humanitarian savior in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 , the mogul was privately forcing employees of their reality-TV show The Apprentice to return to work in the days directly following the storm , multiple former staffers tell The Daily Beast .
“ We all had to come in right after Sandy , ” a former staffer said . “ We were in their building , and we fought with [ a ] manager , who said , ‘ It 's not from me , it 's from [ Donald Trump ] himself'… Ivanka [ Trump ] did very nicely [ come down ] and thank us for coming in , ” the ex-staffer said . “ She really was very nice but we were all [ thinking ] , ‘ Well , it was easy for you Trumps to simply come downstairs , why are we here ? ' ”
The Apprentice alum , who called Trump 's reality series a total “ dictatorship ” with Trump at the helm , described a scene in which mid-level staffers were instructed to brave the storm 's aftermath and devastation and reconvene at Trump 's Manhattan building on Tuesday , Oct. 30 , a day after the storm hit . Hurricane Sandy , the most destructive storm to hit New York in decades , had shut down most of the city . ( The fourth anniversary of the storm will occur next weekend . )
None of that seemed to stop Trump and their senior producers ' drive to keep working . Emails reviewed by The Daily Beast show that some of the staff had in fact worked the day after the storm hit , including having to contact local businesses that were , obviously , in no mood to answer on the immediate day of recovery .
“ There was an internal email that [ had ] gone out for the crew—Hurricane Sandy hit , and we were all made to come into [ Trump Tower ] the day after the storm , ” recounted the former Apprentice staffer , who requested anonymity due to extensive non-disclosure agreements signed by those involved in the production . “ I was personally really pissed off… Everyone said Trump was fully aware . ”
Even though the film crew and celebrity apprentices were given the day off , staffers on the production office floor— “ more than a dozen people with nothing to do , it was really stupid , ” as the staffer described—were ordered to take taxis to Trump Tower . “ This was not safe , it was a mess… we were all fucking pissed off , ” the source said .
Approached by a livid team , a manager clarified that this was “ some fucking Trump bullshit . ”
“ We all worked the day after , ” another former employee told The Daily Beast . “ The whole city was shut down . It was really irresponsible and selfish… Like , no one was under the illusion that we were making fine art here , that it had to be pushed that hard . It was crazy . Business in the city had basically shut down . ”
“ This was all Trump , ” another Apprentice alumnus said . “ If they had wanted us to not brave the aftermath and come to their dumb tower , they could 've done that . It was clear to everyone he… was saying the show must go on . It was un-freakin'-believable . ”
The devastation of the storm in Manhattan was immediate , with power being cut in Lower Manhattan , a crane dangling over a street in Midtown and multiple collapsed buildings . Several thousand people were evacuated due to the eventual crane collapse and at least 53 people died in the storm .
Meanwhile during and after the hurricane , Trump was publicly taking credit for giving storm refugees shelter in Trump Tower , something that they were required to do by law . What 's more , there 's little to no evidence that this major act of supposed charity even occurred .
“ We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium—they are seeking refuge . Free coffee and food , ” they tweeted the day the hurricane made landfall , Oct. 29 .
Within 24 hours , the number of people Trump claimed to shelter had increased tenfold . “ The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm—thanks , staff ! ” they wrote at 12:45 p.m. on Oct 30 .
According to the website for Trump Tower New York , the hotel 's atrium is large enough to hold up to 350 guests for a cocktail party . Packing thousands of people into the fancy lobby would have led to refugee-camp-like conditions—and perhaps garnered a bit of media coverage . But the only photo The Daily Beast could find of Trump Tower sheltering guests during Hurricane Sandy was a screengrab that Business Insider posted from The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon .
Besides that , there was no other documentary evidence that Trump Tower had “ thousands ” of people on the night the hurricane hit . Neither the Trump Organization nor Trump 's presidential campaign responded to requests for more information on any efforts Trump put into helping Hurricane Sandy survivors .
When asked about Trump 's alleged humanitarian aid , a member of the Apprentice crew quickly responded : “ Ha . Ya no pretty sure they did not do that . ”
Trump 's claims of borderline heroism during the chaos of Hurricane Sandy are undermined by the fact that multiple members of their TV show 's staff have told The Daily Beast that they wanted them to continue work in Trump Tower while practically the entire city was at a standstill .
“ We had to work straight through it , ” one staffer said . “ The city was shut down , no traffic lights , etc . I would bike from bk [ Brooklyn ] to [ Trump ] Tower , ” they said of their first days back at work during the storm 's aftermath .
“ When I was working on the show we basically had to work during Hurricane Sandy which was completely absurd , ” another staffer said . “ The executive producers for the show pushed everyone to work during Hurricane Sandy . They actually bragged about how there were 20-30 productions at that time that had shut down except The Apprentice production . ”
According to emails obtained by The Daily Beast sent from production on the show , the crew was expected to show up on Oct. 26 , at which point a preemptive state of emergency had already been declared .
There was an additional shoot scheduled just two days later in Trump Tower .
As one staffer put it , the task of shooting was much easier for Trump who simply had to take the elevator down from their apartment for shots that were to take place in the “ boardroom ” —the show 's primary set .
A slight reprieve came for a number of people on set the day after the storm .
According to emails obtained by The Daily Beast , members of the film crew—but not other staffers—were charitably given a day off on Oct. 30 :
While the film crew was off and the city was recovering , Trump was tweeting away . “ Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- they will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars , ” Trump tweeted that day . They later added a note of generosity about their ongoing crusade to prove that President Obama was not born in the United States .
“ Because of the hurricane , I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama 's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday . ”
That 's right : Trump also used the storm as an opportunity to further fuel the birther conspiracy theories against President Obama . Meanwhile , the crew that was dealing with the damage of the hurricane was expected to be on set by 9 a.m. on Oct. 31 . The city 's subway system was still suspended at that time , making it borderline impossible to travel from one part of New York to the other .
“ You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane— and Florida does n't , ” Trump tweeted on Nov. 1 .
But not crazy enough to stop the show from going on . On Oct. 30 , 2012 , in the midst of the fracas , Trump tweeted that their “ fans should n't worry . We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @ CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm . ”
The Trump campaign and publicists for Apprentice executive producer Mark Burnett did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story .

Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has called for a new uprising against Israel following US President Donald Trump 's recognition of Jerusalem as capital of the Jewish state .
“ We should call for and we should work on launching an intifada in the face of the Zionist enemy , ” said Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , in a speech in Gaza Thursday , Reuters reports .
World leaders expressed serious concern over the decision and its potential to destabilize the region .
Anti-US protests erupted almost immediately after Trump 's declaration Wednesday , with Palestinians first to take to the streets , calling for three days of rage against the move .
Trump 's Jerusalem recognition : Fears of global backlash – FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES : https : //t.co/QD83hbeUhi pic.twitter.com/j0IjzOAmpX — RT ( @ RT_com ) December 6 , 2017
The decision has been welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who thanked Trump , and said they be believes “ many ” other nations will follow suit in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel 's capital .
https : //twitter.com/netanyahu/status/938489784913289218
Egypt and Jordan said Wednesday that they reject the US decision . The Arab League is expected to hold an emergency meeting Saturday to discuss the developments , the head of the Palestinian delegation to the body said Wednesday .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the move disregards the 1980 UN resolution on the status of the city , adding that “ taking such a step throws the region into a circle of fire. ” Saudi Arabia called the step “ irresponsible and unwarranted . ”
Meanwhile , Pope Francis said they could not “ remain silent ” and spoke of their “ great anxiety ” surrounding the decision , while the EU voiced “ serious concern . ”
“ I can not remain silent about my deep concern for the situation that has developed in recent days , ” Francis said at their weekly general audience at the Vatican . “ Jerusalem is a unique city , ” they added , “ sacred to Jews , Christians and Muslims , where the Holy Places for the respective religions are venerated , and it has a special vocation to peace . ”
NTSC Xenoblade Finished Prior to E3 Nintendo of America Sitting on Announcement
July 7 , 2011
American localization of Xenoblade is complete , The Last Story is currently being translated to English for an American release , but there is no word on Pandora 's Tower localization . This information was disclosed to Operation Rainfall today from a source within Nintendo who wishes to remain anonymous . There is currently no indication of when Nintendo of America plans to formally announce these titles .
Last week Nintendo of America told its followers on Facebook and Twitter that it had no plans to bring Xenoblade , The Last Story , and Pandora 's tower to America “ at this time. ” Nintendo intentionally left open the possibility of release . Allegedly , the Redmond , WA branch has been working with other branches to bring Xenoblade and The Last Story to North America .
According to our source , The NTSC version of Xenoblade was completed just over a month ago , while testing for the PAL and NTSC versions of The Last Story could begin in a month . There is currently no word on localization for an NTSC version of Pandora 's Tower .
Remember , this information was disclosed to Operation Rainfall in confidence . Until Nintendo of America makes an announcement , there will be no official word of an NTSC release . However , this news has increased our hope for a North American release of these games . It could also explain why retailers like Amazon continue to have Xenoblade ( Monado : Beginning of the World ) listed on their website .
Make of this information what you will , but after much internal discussion Operation Rainfall believed it would be best to share this information with our followers . Consider this our announcement of a forthcoming announcement .
It appears that Nicola Sturgeon has become the most dangerous woman in Britain . In an interview with the Guardian the SNP leader said their party would have a “ huge ability to change the direction ” of the government in the event of a hung parliament .
And Sturgeon 's deputy , Stewart Hosie , gave a giant clue as to what that might mean . They said during a TV interview that the SNP could vote against “ any bit of spending ” that it did n't agree with , such as Trident .
Together , those statements outraged both the prime minister , David Cameron , and the editors who support their return to Downing Street while opposing the possibility of an accord between Ed Miliband 's Labour and the SNP .
Gone is the praise for their TV performances . Now they are the election 's demon figure as far as Fleet Street 's blue newspapers are concerned .
The SNP will hold Britain 's defence to ransom , says the Times . The SNP is prepared to paralyse the armed forces , says the Daily Telegraph . They will hold UK defence to ransom , says the Times . The SNP is threatening to hold the UK to ransom , says a Daily Mail headline across two pages . The i , which does not toe the Tory line , carries the splash headline , “ SNP veto on Labour spending ” .
The sudden realisation that the Scottish nationalist tail could end up wagging the Westminster ( Labour ) dog is the major concern of most of today 's London-based national newspapers .
“ The SNP plans to co-operate with Labour enough to keep it in power but meddle in unprecedented ways with individual budget items ” , says the Times 's editorial . It continues :
“ The uncertainty on policy that this will bring will be as nothing next to the constitutional chaos caused by the SNP 's refusal yesterday to rule out another referendum on Scottish independence ... The SNP is a separatist party on the cusp of national power , and is not afraid to say how it would use it . It would back Labour on cutting tuition fees , scrapping the coalition 's welfare reforms and fixing energy prices . The signs are that at the same time it would hold the UK budget to ransom with line-item deliberations ... This is not a basis for stable government ” .
The Times concludes that Sturgeon 's offer to Miliband to help them to “ end the Tory agenda ” is only possible “ by ignoring every basic rule of fiscal prudence ” and “ worse still would be their price — their own agenda — which is the break-up of Great Britain ” .
Making a similar point , the Telegraph 's leading article fears “ a party that is literally anti-British ... will effectively hold the whip hand in a Westminster parliament ... The SNP , which may win around one million votes in an electorate of more than 40 million , will have power to dictate policy in the rest of the UK where it is not represented ” .
It argues that this amounts to “ the antithesis of democracy ” and concludes :
“ The flaws in Labour 's devolution strategy , which was meant to slay the dragon of independence not give it new life , have been exposed for all to see . Once again , the threat to the Union is real ” .
The Mail is withering about the SNP 's leader . “ Even by their own megalomaniac standards , Nicola Sturgeon 's language on the day of their manifesto launch is breathtaking in its arrogance ” . ( It does not say this in its Scottish edition , which carries a different , though avowedly unionist , editorial ) .
The Mail believes the SNP , a party representing less than 5 % of the total electorate , is “ intent on destroying the UK ” and that the prospect of its ruling in company with Labour “ should make anyone who believes in democracy shudder ” .
The Sun refers to Sturgeon as an arrogant leader whose chief motive is to ‘ lock the Tories out ' of power ” regardless of whether most voters in England want the Tories in government . It continues :
“ Labour 's agenda — already the most left-wing in 30 years and an imminent danger to the recovery — would be dragged even further to the left . Miliband would drive the economy back to the cliff edge . The SNP — bent on breaking up the UK — will bind them hand and foot , and floor the accelerator ... If Cameron does n't get a majority this is our bleak future ” .
The Daily Express 's columnist , Leo McKinstry , think it would be an “ undemocratic farce ” and “ a disastrous scenario ” should the SNP hold the balance of power in the next parliament . They warn that Sturgeon , “ brimming with tartan ideological fervour ” is aiming to form with Labour “ a Caledonian socialist pact ” and “ an anti-English pact ” .
The non-Tory Independent also sees problems ahead :
“ The greatest of many headaches the Labour chief whip will have in the next parliament is how to prevent left-wing Labour MPs from being seduced by SNP promises on public spending and Trident , and from voting against their own minority Labour government 's budget ” .
The Financial Times , while conceding that the SNP opposes “ the existence of the UK as we know it ” and “ might behave provocatively [ by ] tugging a weak Labour government to the left ” thinks this “ cause for concern , but not panic ” . It argues :
“ Britain has not suddenly lost its ancestral gift for improvisation . It has a way of finding a path through political and constitutional problems ... The system depends on opposition parties resisting the temptation to bring down the government . Look closely and they have an incentive to show such forbearance . If the SNP win virtually every seat in Scotland , as polls suggest , they can only stand to lose if there is another election soon after . They will not want to take risks before the Scottish elections in 2016 ” .
The FT thinks in the “ haggling culture of coalition ” the prime minister of the day “ might proceed on a bill-by-bill basis or seek a “ confidence and supply ” agreement .
It sees a virtue in the Fixed Term Parliaments Act because it “ prevents an election for five years unless a supermajority in the house of commons votes for one , or the government loses a confidence motion and no other administration is formed within 14 days . This provides some insurance against the uncertainty of another election ... Do not underestimate the British knack for muddling through ” .
House votes to expand Bush wiretap powers , telecom immunity Nick Juliano
Published : Friday June 20 , 2008

That is why last year I opposed the so-called Protect America Act , which expanded the surveillance powers of the government without sufficient independent oversight to protect the privacy and civil liberties of innocent Americans . I have also opposed the granting of retroactive immunity to those who were allegedly complicit in acts of illegal spying in the past .
After months of negotiation , the House today passed a compromise that , while far from perfect , is a marked improvement over last year 's Protect America Act .
Under this compromise legislation , an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue , but the President 's illegal program of warrantless surveillance will be over . It restores FISA and existing criminal wiretap statutes as the exclusive means to conduct surveillance  making it clear that the President can not circumvent the law and disregard the civil liberties of the American people . It also firmly re-establishes basic judicial oversight over all domestic surveillance in the future . It does , however , grant retroactive immunity , and I will work in the Senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses . But this compromise guarantees a thorough review by the Inspectors General of our national security agencies to determine what took place in the past , and ensures that there will be accountability going forward . By demanding oversight and accountability , a grassroots movement of Americans has helped yield a bill that is far better than the Protect America Act .
It is not all that I would want . But given the legitimate threats we face , providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay . So I support the compromise , but do so with a firm pledge that as President , I will carefully monitor the program , review the report by the Inspectors General , and work with the Congress to take any additional steps I deem necessary to protect the lives  and the liberty  of the American people.
When it comes to hotels , India is something of an anomaly . For a start , we have great homegrown hotel brands . In every major Indian city or tourist destination , the top two hotels are run by Indian chains . That , alone is more or less unprecedented anywhere in the world .
And yet , the truth is that much of the expansion in the hotel business in India is now happening in the foreign branded sector . ITC , the Oberoi , Taj and Leela open about three new hotels a year between all of them . The foreign chains , put together , open between 20 to 30 new properties per year .
For most Indians , the sudden influx of foreign brands is confusing . What 's the difference between a Westin and a Sheraton ? ( If you find out , let me know ; they are part of the same company . ) How does a Marriott differ from a Hilton ? And so on . These are questions we 've stopped asking about our own chains because they have distinct identities . But the sudden influx of foreign brands puzzles us .
From my perspective , only one foreign chain has created a distinctive identity for itself . When the Hyatt Regency opened in 1982-3 in Delhi , it was – let 's be honest – just another anonymous hotel with small rooms . But starting with the mid-1990s , when it relaunched itself on the basis of F & B ( first La Piazza , then Djinns and now China Kitchen ) , it has begun to be talked about in the same league as the Taj , Maurya or Oberoi .
Smart makeover : After Delhi 's Hyatt Regency relaunched itself on the basis of F & B ( first La Piazza , above ; then Djinns , below ) in the 1990s , it began to be talked about in the same league as the Taj , Maurya or Oberoi .
And now that Hyatt has suddenly become the fastest growing chain in this country , I have found myself staying at Hyatt properties all over India : Bombay , Ludhiana , Amritsar , Madras , Calcutta , Ahmedabad , Gurgaon and more . And though each property is different , certain things seem to stand out : an emphasis on F & B , a sense of architecture and design and – oddly enough , for an American chain – a focus on warmth .
Most people who are interested in hotels know the Hyatt story . Jay Pritzker , a wealthy entrepreneur , saw a hotel they liked near Los Angeles International Airport in 1957 and bought it from its owners , one of whom was called Hyatt von Dehn . Pritzker kept Hyatt 's name and built a chain around it .
They started with airport hotels ( then a novel concept ) and soon expanded into city hotels , involving their family in the company . The Pritzkers were always interested in architecture , and in 1967 , Jay bought a half-finished hotel in Atlanta and turned it into the first large hotel to be built around an atrium , a trend that would be widely copied around the world .
Just like indians : Hyatt founder Jay Pritzker and their son , Tom , the company 's executive chairperson , have made sure their India hotels like Delhi 's Hyatt Regency and Mumbai 's Grand Hyatt have a sense of warmth .
In 1969 , Hyatt opened its first overseas hotel in Hong Kong . Since then , there has been breakneck expansion around the world , much of it ( contrary to current industry practice ) financed by the Pritzkers themselves , which means that Hyatt owns many more of its hotels than any of its competitors . ( The Four Seasons , for example , does not own a single one of the hotels it operates . )
The willingness to put their own money into the company sounds almost Indian : ITC , the Leela and the Oberoi own most of their luxury properties . The other Indian touch is the family aspect . Hilton is a faceless corporation , passed around from owner to owner , as is InterContinental , and Starwood is always the subject of takeover rumours .
But though the Pritzkers insist that the company is professionally run ( the CEO is Mark Hoplamazian ) , there is still a strong sense of family within Hyatt . For instance , Hyatt prides itself on its ability to enable people to grow within the organisation . Most people at the top of the operations end of the business have spent the majority of their careers with Hyatt . Just as there is an ITC or an Oberoi mindset in Indian hoteliering , there is also a Hyatt DNA .
Because most Indians were used only to Delhi 's Hyatt Regency ( it was nearly 20 years before another Hyatt opened in India ) , we sometimes miss the complex nature of the group 's branding . When Hyatt invited me to Chicago to interview Hoplamazian , I tried to get them to make sense of the branding for me .
Some of it is clear enough . The Regency is your basic five-star , the Grand Hyatts are bigger hotels , often with space for conventions , and the Park Hyatts are top of the line , on par with the Four Seasons or the Ritz-Carlton . Hyatt has rethought the Park concept in recent years , which is why some Parks ( Madras , Hyderabad etc ) seem right while others ( Goa , my example , not his ) are much less impressive .
But other than these three basic categories , there 's a lot more . There is Andaz , which much of the trade sees as Hyatt 's answer to W , but which , Hoplamazian says categorically , was never meant to be anything like that . The W brand is a corporate version of the kinds of hotels that Ian Schrager ( the former owner of the Studio 54 nightclub ) opened ( such as New York 's Royalton ) which were hip and trendy . ( Or as Maryam Banikarim , Hyatt 's global chief marketing officer , puts it , “ Schrager 's hotels were intended to have a nightclub sensibility ” . )
Casual elegance : Andaz , aimed at “ the CEO in jeans ” , has found success in locations like New York .
The W chain has so successfully perfected that hip-hotel formula that even Schrager themselves ( who has now tied up with Marriott ) does not seem able to compete with it . But Andaz , says Hoplamazian , is not meant to be hip or trendy . Rather it draws on Hyatt 's traditional design skills to be a luxury hotel for creative people ( “ The CEO who wears jeans , ” says Banikarim ) . To be fair , the Andaz concept has gone through many revisions since the first one opened in London ( I 've been there ; strange place ! ) and has finally found great success in such new locations as Fifth Avenue in New York .
But the first Andaz in India , which opens next year in Delhi 's Aerocity , will not be a boutique property ( it will have 400 rooms ) , will have only two restaurants and will reinvent the hotel room in design terms . Peter Fulton , an old India hand who now looks after many of Hyatt 's international operations , says they set out to create a hotel that will not overwhelm with glitz and marble ( “ It may even underwhelm ! ” they laugh ) but grows on you because of its creativity and style .
Hyatt is as excited about its other brands . There 's Hyatt Place , which in industry shorthand , translates as Hyatt 's answer to Courtyard , which may be too simplistic . There are already Hyatt Places operational in India ( Hampi , Gurgaon etc ) and more will open . The hotels will offer a Hyatt experience in a pared-down form ( there 's no room service in the US properties but the Indian hotels will offer limited room service ) with less investment in restaurants and public areas . In big cities , the rate should be around ` 4,000 or less , and eventually , if all goes well , they should be able to eat into the Oyo Rooms market .
There 's also Hyatt House , the long-stay brand that has been a huge success in the US and which will further target the guesthouse segment , offering suites with kitchenettes for those who have to stay in a city for a couple of weeks or more . Again , the key is affordability . Unlike fancy service apartments ( such as Bombay 's exclusive Wellington Mews ) , these will cost only a little more than guesthouses .
I asked Hoplamazian and Banikarim the obvious question . Were n't they worried about diluting the Hyatt brand ? Indian hotel companies , for instance , are fiercely protective of the main brand . ITC only lends its name to luxury hotels . Lesser properties are called WelcomHotels or Sheratons and its mid-market brand is Fortune . Biki Oberoi refuses to allow even deluxe properties ( such as the Trident in Bombay 's BKC ) to use the Oberoi name . The messy rebranding done by the Taj a few years ago withdrew the Taj brand from many properties .
But Banikarim sees it differently . They say that research has shown that guests look for two things in a brand : reliability and affordability . If a product is called Hyatt , then it has a guarantee of quality . The second part of the brand ( whether it is Regency or Place or whatever ) tells guests what to expect and how much they 'll have to pay .
It is an interesting answer to an old question . And it takes us back to where we started . Do Indians really understand foreign brands ? Does anyone know what Hilton stands for ? And even if they do , is it clear what a Hilton Garden Inn is ? Do we even care ? If brands are so important then why do n't the Ritz-Carlton in Bangalore and the Four Seasons in Bombay ( both great brands and wonderful hotels ) command the highest rates in their cities ?
My guess is that we are on the cusp of a change . There 's no doubt that India has some of the world 's finest luxury hotels and that Indians are ( as Mark Hoplamazian says ) perfect hoteliers . But the hotel sector is changing in India . With so many new hotels opening and with so many fresh ideas and concepts flowing in , we will have no choice but to take the foreign companies more seriously and the Indian chains will have to up their game .
And judging by what I 've seen and heard , Hyatt is going to be the chain to beat .

Mixture of beer and other liquids , I thought it looked cool : )
I made lots so that my mom , brother and stepdad could have some too .
I squashed this one by mistake : (
I did n't ice all of them because I did n't have enough icing sugar to double the recipe .
Wonky icing : D
Om nom nom : D
I 've been wanting to bake something ... I have n't baked for a while , nor used a piping bag for a while , so I was a bit nervous but everything turned out awesome so I am glad : ) I followed the recipe found here . This recipe makes me happy because it contains measurements for non-gluten flours : D so I shall be making a batch of these sometime so that I may enjoy them too : ) The only changes I made were that I used Bells instead of Irish Whiskey and I did n't make the caramel drizzle . I tasted a tiny bit of one and it was really nice : ) and the buttercream was awesome : D and apparently the cupcakes were really good so YAY ! The two full trays had been on the lower shelf and I am not 100 % sure why those cupcakes seem to have `` sunk '' compared to the other tray : ( our helper lady said that it could be because when we were putting the trays into the oven ( she helped me so the oven would n't be open for too long ) , we left the door open too long to put another shelf for the last tray to go on top . I 'll be making these again and will make sure that I do n't waste time moving shelves around haha : )

China 's internet regulator has demanded stricter controls over the popular practice of live streaming , as part of a range of new requirements for sites .
As well as asking sites to step up control of live broadcasts , the Cyberspace Administration of China wants the content monitored full-time .
It is the latest move by authorities to clamp down on what it sees as `` inappropriate '' content online .
Live streaming is particularly popular among Chinese youth .
There are an an estimated 80 platforms in use around the country , with some gaining notoriety for hosting live broadcasts of stunts that have gone viral .
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Thousands of people have downloaded streaming app Yi
The People 's Daily reported that the CAC statement asked sites to `` strengthen security evaluation of new products like live broadcast '' . It also said the the new requirements would apply to `` bullet-screens '' - where online user comments pop-up on top of live videos .
It is just one of a range of new requirements placed on websites to better regulate themselves , including putting the onus on them to set up 24-hour monitoring of their online content .
In April , the Ministry of Culture announced it was investigating a number of popular live-streaming platforms for allegedly hosting pornographic or violent content that `` harms social morality '' .
It was also the month one of China 's biggest internet stars , comedian and vlogger , Papi Jiang promised to `` correct '' herself , after warnings from government officials over their foul language .
Live streaming platforms like Bilibili , YY , Inke or Douyu are attracting millions of viewers .
The content is monetized by allowing viewers to purchase virtual gifts for real money and send them to the host of any stream they particularly like . The revenue coming in from those gifts is then shared between the host and the streaming site .
Some of China 's streaming stars :
One of China 's biggest live streaming stars is Xia Keke , a 22-year old woman , who by chatting , singing and dancing has reportedly managed to earn more than $ 700,000 last year .
Liu Xini is another example , making money both from getting virtual presents during their live streams and their own clothing and lifestyle brand that they promote during those streams .
The most recent example of a stream gone viral was when Olympic swimmer Fu Yuanhui did a one hour broadcast attracting more than 11 million views and almost $ 50,000 worth of virtual gifts . Fu had become an overnight social media sensation thanks to their frank post-race interviews and exaggerated expressions at the Rio games .

In May , Chinese authorities reportedly banned people filming themselves eating bananas in a `` seductive '' fashion .
Hosts were also banned from wearing stockings and suspenders during their streaming sessions .
Chinese media also report of some users filming themselves having sex or women appearing topless during their live streams .
China 's tech giants including messaging and gaming company Tencent , mobile company Xiaomi and micro-blogging giant Sina , among others , all have video streaming sites .
Investigators believe the gunman shot their mother at home , where they lived with her , and are researching the suspected gunman 's writings , looking for any clues as to what might have precipitated one of the worst mass shootings in history . NBC 's Pete Williams reports .
The weapons used in Friday 's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Conn. , were legally purchased and registered to Nancy Lanza , the mother of the gunman , Adam Lanza , two law enforcement officials told NBC News .
The gunman was clad in black and used two 9mm pistols to kill 20 small children and six adults at the school . It was unclear how many shots were fired there .
Two 9mm handguns , one made by Glock and the other by Sig Sauer , were recovered inside the school . An AR-15-type rifle also was found at the scene , but there were conflicting reports Friday night whether it had been used in the shooting .
In total , 28 people died in Friday 's rampage , including the gunman , who was found at the scene , and a woman believed to be Nancy Lanza , found shot dead at a home in Newtown . They were a teacher .
Under Connecticut law , people under 21 are prohibited from purchasing or carrying handguns . Adam Lanza was 20 .
The nonprofit Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence ranks gun control laws in Connecticut and neighboring states New Jersey , New York and Massachusetts as the most stringent in the nation , after California .
Government officials Undated photo confirmed by government officials to be Adam Lanza , who apparently killed themselves after killing more than two dozen others , including 20 school children .
Connecticut allows possession of assault rifles , except those with certain features , such as a fixed bayonet type lug , or a collapsible stock , according to attorney David Clough of Southbury , Conn .
Otherwise they are allowed , and like other rifles , easier to acquire than handguns .
Under Connecticut law , anyone 21 or older can purchase ammunition , Clough said .
The Associated Press , citing an unnamed official , reported that state police records show that Nancy Lanza had legally purchased five firearms , all registered in Connecticut , though the reported was not independently confirmed by NBC News . The AP later reported that authorities also recovered three other guns — a Henry repeating rifle , an Enfield rifle and a shotgun . It was not clear where those weapons were found .

the decline of Java application servers when using docker containers
James Strachan Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 9 , 2015
For many years the Java ecosystem has used Application Servers . The basic idea of a Java Application Server ( Servlet Engine , JEE or OSGi ) is its a JVM process you deploy & undeploy your java code to as a deployment unit ( jar / war / ear / bundle etc ) . So a JVM process mutates the code it runs over time . Often Java Application Servers have directories you drop files into or REST/JMX APIs to modify the running deployment units ( Java code ) .
Memory used to be very expensive so it used to make lots of sense to put all your Java code into the same JVM process to minimise RAM footprint of running lots of processes .
Its been common practice for many years in the Java ecosystem that in production you never really un-deploy Java code in a running JVM ; since It 's far too easy to leak resources ( threads , memory , database connections , sockets , running code etc ) . So to upgrade the version of an application in production its better to spin up a new Application Server process with the new code inside in parallel ; move traffic to the new application server instance and drain traffic from the old instance so that once the old application server has finished processing all its in flight requests it can be stopped .
Conceptually you still undeploy the old code and deploy the new code ; but in reality you boot up a new process and move traffic over to the new process and kill the old one .
There 's a current movement towards micro services ; making each process do one thing well . In many ways recommended best practice in the use of application servers for years has been ; try to run a small number of deployment units per JVM as you can get away with . If you put all your services ( deployment units ) into the same JVM ; then if you need to upgrade one of those services you have to take down the JVM which can affect all the other services . So its less risky and more agile to deploy each service in a different JVM process so you can upgrade any service at any point in time without affecting any of the other services .
Having lots of independent processes rather than a huge monolith process is also much easier to monitor and understand which service is using up memory , network , disk or CPU etc .
How docker changes things
Docker containers are an ideal way to package up applications for easy deployment on linux machines ; they use immutable container images for all the operating system and code they need to use ; they are isolated from each other and can have cgroups limits on IO/memory/CPU usage etc . They work well with pretty much any technology that can run on linux ( Java / python / ruby / nodejs / golang et al ) .
One of the big wins of docker containers is you can spin up as many instances of a container you like on any machine and they work in a repeatable way since they are based on the same reusable immutable image . A container instance can have its own persistent state mounted on a volume ; but the code ( and possibly configuration ) comes from an immutable image .
So the docker way to work with Java Application Servers is to make an immutable image for the application server and the deployment units you wish to run in production .
To upgrade the Java code of a service , rather than dropping a WAR in the webapps/deploy folder or calling a REST/JMX API in the application server or whatever , you just make a new image with the new deployment unit inside and run it .
Increasingly the Java Application Server does n't need to worry about deploying and undeploying new code at runtime ; it does n't need to watch a deployment folder for changes or listen on a REST/JMX API for requests to change its deployment ; it just starts up the code in its image on startup .
So the very idea of a Java Application Server ( a dynamic JVM which you deploy and undeploy code to ) is very much in the decline in a docker world .
The best way to work with Application Services in docker is to treat them more as an immutable disk image ; there 's less need for Java code inside the process to mutate itself at runtime . Then the rolling upgrade of new versions of containers is done outside of the application server itself ( e.g . via rolling upgrades in kubernetes and using a load balancer in front of the containers ) .
Configuration
One thing the Java ecosystem has done well since adopting Application Servers is creating immutable binary deployment units ( jars/wars/ears/bundles etc ) , releasing them once and moving them between environments . To do that we often delegate to the application server to find resources ( e.g . lookup in JNDI for JEE ) for things like discovering where the database is or message broker . Then there would be separate clusters of independently configured application servers which you deployed your artefacts to ; assuming that the application servers were properly configured .
Though its surprisingly easy to mess up and for different environments to be running different operating systems , Java versions , application server versions or mismatched configurations ; things may work in your staging environment but if you 're not very careful they may fail in production .
Instead the docker approach is to extend the idea of immutable images to the operating system and application server too ; so the exact same binary image of the operating system , Java runtime , application server and deployment units would be run in each environment . So there 's no chance of hitting an issue with a mis-configured application server in a certain environment since its the same binary image that runs everywhere .
To be able to do this well ; having service discovery in each environment is extremely useful as it makes it really easy to run the same image in every environment without messing with configuration . e.g . things like kubernetes service discovery can make it trivial to run the same binary image in all environments and for service discovery of things like databases and message brokers to just work .
Summary
So does that mean Java application servers are dead ? In a docker world there 's really no need to ever hot deploy java code into a running java process in production any more . However that can be useful in development ; being able to hot deploy code into a running instance . ( Though to be fair you can do the same thing in any Java application with tools like JRebel ; most IDE debuggers do the same trick too ) .
So I 'd say that Java Application Servers are mutating into becoming more like frameworks that are baked into an immutable image that are then managed externally by the cloud ( e.g . via kubernetes ) . In many ways the cloud ( e.g . kubernetes and docker ) takes over many of the features that Java application servers used to do ; since rolling upgrades of new images is needed for all technologies ( java/golang/nodejs/python/ruby et al ) .
Though Java folks still want services that Java application servers provide ( e.g . servlet engine , dependency injection , transactions , messaging and so forth ) . However you do n't need to dynamically drop deployment units into a running application server JVM for that ; e.g . you can easily embed a servlet engine into a Java application . Approaches like Spring Boot show how just using dependency injection is enough to get most of the features of an application server but taking a framework approach using a flat class loader .
As a developer one of the biggest issues complexities of working with Java Application Servers is actually class loaders ; I think we 've all hit class loader issues at some point . There 's some value in hiding the implementation jars for services in JEE from the developers ; though you can fix that by just using a BOM file to import maven dependencies in your project ; you do n't need a complex class loader tree or graph for that . Even with a flat classpath though , you can end up with conflicting versions ; so having ways to isolate class loaders can be handy . Though in some ways using different versions of the same jar implies a code smell ; maybe in those cases its time to refactor into 2 separate services so that you can keep nice simple flat class loaders ?
If a Java Application Server process is now only starting a statically known set of Java code ; the very idea of an application server changes drastically to be more about a way of performing dependency injection and including the modular services you need ; that sounds more like a framework than what we 've come to think of as a Java Application Server .
Lots of Java developers have learnt to use Application Servers and will continue to use them in a docker world ; which is fine . But at the same time I see their use declining as lots of the things application servers have done for us over the years are now not so relevant with docker & kubernetes and frameworks can do most of that instead in a simpler , leaner way .
One thing thats great about docker and the cloud is it lets developers choose what technologies they wish to use ; they can choose the right tool for the right job and have all their technologies provisioned and managed in the same way whatever the language and frameworks used . You can start off using the technologies you know and over time migrate to lighter alternatives .
In the fabric8 project we 're now pretty agnostic on what Application Servers or frameworks you wish to use ; Camel Boot , CDI , Spring Boot , Karaf , Tomcat , Vertx , Wildfly are all supported in our quickstarts . Thanks to kubernetes we can provide the same provisioning , management and tooling experience whatever application server or framework you choose to use . If you 're starting a new Camel project for use in fabric8 V2 for example I highly recommend you start with Camel Boot ( like these quickstarts ) or try the Spring Boot quickstarts .
Increasingly I see more Java folks choosing the lighter approach of things like Camel Boot , CDI , Dropwizard , Vertx or Spring Boot and over time using less Java Application Servers ; though we 'll still need dependency injection and frameworks .

Join Cardinal Burke 's call for the Consecration of Russia . Sign the petition !
ROME , May 19 , 2017 ( LifeSiteNews ) – Cardinal Raymond Burke issued a call this morning for the Catholic faithful to “ work for the consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary . ”
Cardinal Burke , who is one of the four Cardinals who have asked Pope Francis for a clarification of Amoris Laetitia , made their appeal at the Rome Life Forum , in the month of the centenary of Our Lady of Fatima 's first apparition to the three shepherd children .
Burke is the former prefect of the Apostolic Signatura and current Patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta .
In a comprehensive address on “ The Secret of Fatima and a New Evangelization , ” Cardinal Burke , in the presence of fellow dubia Cardinal Carlo Caffarra , outspoken Kazakhstan Bishop Athanasius Schneider and over 100 life and family leaders from 20 nations , said that the triumph of the Immaculate Heart would mean much more than the ending of world wars , and the physical calamities that Our Lady of Fatima predicted .
“ As horrible as are the physical chastisements associated with man 's disobedient rebellion before God , infinitely more horrible are the spiritual chastisements for they have to do with the fruit of grievous sin : eternal death , ” they said .
Read the full text of Cardinal Burke 's historic call for the Consecration here .
They expressed agreement with one of the foremost Fatima scholars , Frère Michel de la Sainte Trinité , who said that the promised triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary undoubtedly refers firstly to “ the victory of the Faith , which will put an end to the time of apostasy , and the great shortcomings of the Church 's pastors . ”
Turning to the current situation in the Church in light of Our Lady of Fatima 's revelations , Burke said :
The teaching of the Faith in its integrity and with courage is the heart of the office of the Church 's pastors : the Roman Pontiff , the Bishops in communion with the See of Peter , and their principal co-workers , the priests . For that reason , the Third Secret is directed , with particular force , to those who exercise the pastoral office in the Church . Their failure to teach the faith , in fidelity to the Church 's constant teaching and practice , whether through a superficial , confused or even worldly approach , and their silence endangers mortally , in the deepest spiritual sense , the very souls for whom they have been consecrated to care spiritually . The poisonous fruits of the failure of the Church 's pastors is seen in a manner of worship , of teaching and of moral discipline which is not in accord with Divine Law .
The call for the consecration of Russia is for some controversial , but Cardinal Burke addressed the reasons for their appeal simply and straightforwardly . “ The requested consecration is at once a recognition of the importance which Russia continues to have in God 's plan for peace and a sign of profound love for our brothers and sisters in Russia , ” they said .
“ Certainly , Pope Saint John Paul II consecrated the world , including Russia , to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on March 25 , 1984 , ” said Cardinal Burke . “ But , today , once again , we hear the call of Our Lady of Fatima to consecrate Russia to their Immaculate Heart , in accord with their explicit instruction . ”
The want for the ‘ explicit ' mention of Russia in the consecration as requested by Our Lady was desired by Pope John Paul II , but not undertaken due to pressure from counselors . This fact was confirmed most recently by the official representative of Pope Francis at the Fatima anniversary celebration last week in Karaganda , Kazakhstan .
Speaking on May 13 , Cardinal Paul Josef Cordes , former president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum , recalled their conversation with Pope John Paul II after the 1984 consecration , or “ entrustment , '' which took place March 25 , when the statue of Our Lady of Fatima was in Rome .
“ Obviously , for a long time [ the pope ] had dealt with that significant mission which the Mother of God had given to the seer children there , ” Cordes said . “ However , they held back to mention Russia explicitly , because the Vatican diplomats had urgently asked them not to mention this country because otherwise political conflicts might perhaps arise . ”
For those who may still object to calling for the consecration of Russia , Cardinal Burke recalled the words of Pope St. John Paul II who in 1982 during their consecration of the world to the Immaculate Heart noted : “ Mary 's appeal is not for just once . Them appeal must be taken up by generation after generation , in accordance with the ever new ‘ signs of the times ' . It must be unceasingly returned to . It must ever be taken up anew . ”
Instructing the faithful , Cardinal Burke taught that Our Lady of Fatima `` provides for us the means to go faithfully to their Divine Son and to seek from Him the wisdom and strength to bring Their saving grace to a profoundly troubled world . ”
Cardinal Burke outlined six means Our Lady gave at Fatima for the faithful take part in the restoration of peace in the world and in the Church :
to pray the Rosary each day to wear the Brown Scapular ; to make sacrifices for the sake of saving sinners ; to make reparation for offenses to their Immaculate Heart by means of the First Saturday devotion ; and to convert our own lives ever more to Christ . Lastly , they ask the Roman Pontiff , in union with all the Bishops of the world , to consecrate Russia to their Immaculate Heart .
“ By these means , they promise that their Immaculate Heart will triumph , bringing souls to Christ , their Son , ” Cardinal Burke added . “ Turning to Christ , they will make reparation for their sins . Christ , through the intercession of Their Virgin Mother , will save them from Hell and bring peace to the whole world . ”

The Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is seeking assistance from technology companies to monitor visa holders in the United States , ProPublica reported Wednesday .
ICE officials explained at a conference last week that they are hoping to develop algorithms that would assess potential threats posed by visa holders , and conduct social media surveillance of those deemed high risk . Microsoft , Deloitte and Motorola Solutions were among the companies in attendance .
“ We have millions and millions and millions of people coming every year , and subsequently departing , so we have to be smart about it , ” said Louis Rodi , deputy assistant director of one of ICE 's national security programs .
Carissa Cutrell , a spokesperson for ICE , told ProPublica that the Department of Homeland Security has not actually begun building such a program , but was simply gathering information from industry leaders .
ICE officials told tech companies last week that the department hopes to get automated notifications about any visa holders ' social media activity . ICE already monitors some social media posts , but plans to expand its operation .
President Trump has since taking office repeated calls for “ extreme vetting , ” ramping up those calls in the wake of terrorist attacks . The Trump administration has also sought to ban immigrants from certain countries .
As I noted in my last post about Bryan Fischer , one of the best things about their routine efforts to “ set the record straight ” on their long history of bigotry is how , in attempting to clarify what they claims are misrepresentations , they generally end up saying pretty much the very thing they are claiming never to have said .
Case in point : on today 's broadcast they took issue with the assertion that they said gays were responsible for the Holocaust and clarified that they never said anything of the sort . What they said , they explained , was that the Nazi Party was responsible for the Holocaust … and that gays were responsible for the formation of the Nazi Party :
They say that I make the contention that gays caused the Holocaust . This is wrong . I have been very clear in my writings and everything I 've said that the Nazi Party is responsible for the Holocaust . But how did the Nazi Party come into being ? The Nazi Party , ladies and gentlemen , was formed in a gay bar in Munich . And historians agree that Hitler 's earliest enforcers – the Stormtroopers , the Brownshirts – were almost , without exception , homosexuals . So it was homosexual thugs that helped Hitler to form the Nazi Party . In other words : no homosexual thugs , no homosexual Brownshirts , no homosexual Stormtroopers ; NO NAZI PARTY !
So , to clarify : gays were responsible for the Nazi Party , and the Nazi Party was responsible for the Holocaust … but it is wrong to claim that Fischer thinks that gays caused the Holocaust .
Got it ?

As negotiators for the United Auto Workers and Detroit automakers hammer out new contracts , something new is looming over the talks for the first time : UAW autoworkers in Michigan will have the right to withdraw from the union and stop paying dues after the current contracts expire .
Industry experts are n't sure how many workers will opt to leave the union . They say what comes out of new contracts with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. likely will influence how many of the tens of thousands of UAW autoworkers leave the union .
The current contracts are set to expire Sept. 14 , and many labor law experts say that 's when the workers can opt out . The UAW did not immediately comment .
Michigan passed right-to-work legislation in 2012 that went into effect in March 2013 . The legislation forbids requiring workers to belong to and pay dues to a union ; it leaves it up to workers to decide . The UAW contracts being negotiated now for the autoworkers are the first since Michigan became a right-to-work state .
“ This is going to be a big battle in Michigan , ” said Kristin Dziczek , director of the industry and labor at the Center for Automotive Research . “ Last year , Michigan 's overall unionization rate fell dramatically . ”
Although membership nationwide in the UAW grew 3.1 percent last year , the percentage of all Michigan workers in unions fell to 14.5 percent last year from 16.3 percent a year earlier . There are 25 right-to-work states . Among recent converts , Indiana enacted a right-to-work law in 2012 ; Wisconsin adopted a right-to-work law earlier this year .
Since this is the first time Big Three autoworkers have had the chance to opt out in the three states , industry and even union officials say it 's difficult to predict how many will withdraw . The UAW says in other right-to-work states , UAW membership levels have not dropped much — in some cases a percentage point or two .
Late last year , UAW President Dennis Williams said the union is working to communicate and educate members on union benefits .
Some organizations have been working to assist autoworkers who want to opt out . The Mackinac Center for Public Policy , a conservative think tank in Michigan , recently launched a website , www.uawoptout.com , that includes an opt-out form and information for UAW members considering it .
“ We just want people to be aware of their options , ” said F. Vincent Vernuccio , director of labor policy for the Mackinac Center .
Dziczek said a big factor is the UAW 's second-tier workforce — those hired more recently , who are paid a lower hourly rate than veteran workers . Second-tier workers account for about 45 percent at Fiat Chrysler , 28 percent at Ford and 20 percent at GM .
“ It also depends a lot on how second-tier feel on their connection to the union and what this contract brings , ” Dziczek said , adding that some workers who feel they are n't getting much out of dues may choose to opt-out .
Last year , the UAW increased dues 25 percent to help restore its strike fund .
Vernuccio said , “ Members who are getting short-changed may likely question the value of their membership . ”
‘ It 's all about freedom '
Still , some workers want to stop paying dues . One is Brian Pannebecker , an hourly employee at Ford 's Sterling Axle Plant in Sterling Heights .
“ It 's all about freedom , ” they said . “ I should not be forced to join and financially support a third-party political organization in order to keep my job at Ford Motor Co . ”
Pannebecker , upset over the dues hike and money that had been taken from the UAW 's strike fund to cover other expenses , resigned from the union a year ago — something workers already legally can do — and is paying an agency fee that represents about 65 percent of full UAW dues . That covers the cost of collective bargaining .
An attorney from the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation this summer hosted two town hall meetings in Flint to explain how to resign from the union . A spokesperson said more than 100 people attended .
The foundation has information — including sample resignation letters— on its website at www.nrtw.org . It plans to reach UAW members through social media and has posted a video on YouTube .
Foundation attorney Glenn Taubman said the organization believes federal and state law will allow UAW members in Michigan to resign and revoke paying dues immediately after the contract expires . Taubman said workers who want to opt out should send copies of their letter to the UAW International , their local union and employer .
“ If any employees have a problem exercising these rights , we 'd be happy to hear from them , ” they said .
UAW membership grew 3.1 percent in 2014 to 403,466 , though membership is down by tens of thousands from a decade ago . About 140,000 hourly union members are employed by Detroit automakers .
Those who might consider leaving the union are sure to face blowback on the assembly line . During the Labor Day parade Monday in Detroit , UAW Local 22 members who work at GM 's Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant wore T-shirts with the slogan “ It 's Wrong Not to Belong. ” Second-tier Detroit-Hamtramck worker John Jablonski , 24 , said they plan to stick with the UAW no matter what : “ I will always pay my union dues . ”
Some local unions in right-to-work states have listed non-members on their websites , and Dziczek said locals in Michigan do the same thing .
Ranks in U.S. rose in '14
About 1 in 8 adults working in the U.S. belongs to a union , and 17 percent are in a household with at least one union member , according to Gallup Inc . Nationally , union membership rose in 2014 to about 14.6 million from 14.5 million in 2013 .
Michigan 's union membership fell by about 48,000 in 2014 .
The Michigan Education Association says it has lost about 5 percent of its members since 2012 , partly attributable to right-to-work , said Doug Pratt , the MEA 's director of public affairs . Other factors include layoffs and school funding cuts , they said .
“ That means the vast , vast , the vast majority of our members are sticking around because they believe in what we do as an organization , ” Pratt said .
The MEA allows members to resign only in August . Pratt declined to provide specifics on how many members left last month . The MEA 's membership , including retirees , is about 140,000 , down from about 150,000 in 2012 , Pratt said .
American Federation of Teachers Michigan President David Hecker said right-to-work has had a “ very , very slight ” impact on membership , though they did not provide figures . The union has 35,000 members including teachers , faculty , graduate employees and support staff .
Hecker said more members have become active in the union since right-to-work was enacted : “ What the impact has been , is people being recommitted and re-energized because our members know there 's only one reason for right-to-work , which is to destroy the unions … and take away their voice . ”
A recent Gallup poll found union approval ratings rose 5 percentage points to 58 percent over the past year , the highest point since 2008 . The poll calculated its lowest union approval rating of 48 percent in 2009 .
The survey found 37 percent want unions to have more influence , up from 25 percent in 2009 . Support for unions is higher in the East and Midwest than it is in the West and South .
The research company has been tracking U.S. citizens ' thoughts on organized labor since 1936 when 72 percent of Americans approved of unions .

Long ago , many scientists believed that aging occurs as the body deteriorates over time . It was thought that only lifestyle factors and a list of diseases contribute to determining our lifespan . However , a groundbreaking finding , published in 1993 , changed the way scientists thought of aging .
“ The idea that ageing was subject to control was completely unexpected. ” Cynthia Kenyon
In the early 1990s , it was hard to grasp that a set of genes — or perhaps one — could control aging . But , Cynthia Kenyon , a molecular biologist and biogerontologist , believed that it was possible . They hypothesized that some gene ( s ) is responsible of us aging , thereby we could control aging by manipulating it .
In their lab , located at the University of California , they and their team started experimenting on microscopic roundworms called Caenorhabditis Elegans . These roundworms were a perfect target for research because they had a short lifespan and genes that were easily manipulated . To find out which genes affected lifespan , they randomly introduced genetic mutations and observed the response . They used a technique called temperature-sensitive mutations which allowed roundworms to develop normally under permissive temperature . The mutations were activated only after hatching when the scientists raised the temperature , therefore , allowing offspring to develop normally in their eggs1 .
During the observation , in 1993 , they discovered that some of the roundworms outlived the normal ones by a double amount of years . Disabling a single gene , DAF-2 , allowed some worms to live twice as long as normal ones – called wild type .
According to Cynthia , “ It was very profound because you look at these worms , and the normal worms are dying , and the worms in this other culture dish are young . And you think : ‘ Oh my God , they should be dead . ' It was like finding something that should n't be . It makes your hair stand up. ” It appears that the DAF-2 mutants stay healthy for the entire period as well . As they age , the tissues of both wild-type and DAF- 2 mutants become progressively more mottled and disorganized ; however , this physical decline occurs at a much slower rate in the mutant2 . What is also promising is that these DAF-2 mutants are also resistant to old-age diseases , which really makes sense since these diseases often occur because of the effects of aging . This profound discovery , however , raises a lot of questions . What exactly DAF-2 is responsible of and would it be possible to apply the same method on humans ?
In Cynthia 's TED Talk , they explain that the DAF-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor that “ catches the hormone as it comes by [ outside of the cell ] and the other part is from the inside where it sends signals into the cell. ” These signals are actually responsible for speeding up the aging process . The DAF-2 hormone receptor , found in these worms , is actually similar to two human hormone receptors : the receptors for insulin , a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients , and IGF-2 , a hormone that promotes growth3 . This suggests that the limiting of these two hormones can result in an extended lifespan . In fact , lifespans of mammals , and , to a limited extent , C. elegans , can be increased by food limitation1 .
How exactly does the limiting of these hormones delay aging is a far more complex process . Further research imply that the deactivation of these receptors activates a gene regulator protein called FOXO . Briefly , this gene helps activate a whole other new set of genes which does a better job at repairing and protecting the tissues , as well as making them live longer .
Regarding the worms , we are glad that some of them got to live longer . But , what about us ? Cynthia seems to be very optimistic for many reasons . They point out that damaging the genes encoding insulin or IGF-1 receptors can extend the lifespan of other animals too such as flies and mice . As we know , mice are mammals like us . They also refer to studies showing that humans inclined to age a 100 years old are more likely to have mutations in the DAF-2 gene . There are also certain forms of the FOXO gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 , they says3 .
“ I 'm really optimistic , and I think it wo n't be too long , I hope , before this age-old dream begins to come true. ” C. Kenyon
Cynthia 's ultimate goal is to actually move from their microscopic worms to humans . “ We are trying to find drugs , small molecules , that people could take to make them disease-resistant , more youthful and healthy . Eventually we will find them . ”

With the greatest respect to Justin Trudeau , Liberal MP Iqra Khalid and the federal Liberal caucus , it 's none of your damn business whether I have a fear of Islam , which is what “ Islamophobia ” means .
As a Jew , my fear of Islam — pertaining specifically to that malignant and widespread strain of it that hates Jews — is completely rational .
But even if it was irrational , it is not the business of the government to tell me how I should FEEL about anything .
That 's what dictatorships ( many of them Islamic , which have driven Jews out of their countries ) do .
In a democracy , the proper role of government is to prevent me from ACTING in a bigoted manner towards Muslims because of my feelings , regardless of whether they are rational .
I am also capable of fearing that malignant and widespread strain of Islam that hates Jews , while being outraged by the massacre of innocent Muslims peacefully praying in a Quebec mosque .
I condemn that vile ACT , along with all ACTS of anti-Muslim bigotry , which have nothing to do with my rational fear of that malignant and widespread strain of Islam that hates Jews .
I also condemn the death threats my Sun colleague , Tarek Fatah , a Muslim , constantly faces from followers of Islam for their views critical of Islam as it is practised in large parts of the Islamic world , including by some Muslims in Canada .
My fear of that malignant and widespread strain of Islam that hates Jews is well-founded .
In the modern era alone , I can draw a line from the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , Haj Amin al-Husseini , siding with Hitler and the Nazis in the Second World War , starting in November , 1941 , to Iran 's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , calling the Jewish state of Israel a “ fake ” nation and a “ dirty chapter ” of history on Tuesday .
I can quote from the 1988 Jew-hating charter of Hamas , the elected government in Gaza , which says : “ Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it …
“ Our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious … The ( Islamic Resistance ) Movement is but one squadron that should be supported by more and more squadrons from this vast Arab and Islamic world , until the enemy is vanquished and Allah 's victory is realized . ”
“ Hamas has been looking forward to implementing Allah 's promise whatever time it might take . The prophet , prayer and peace be upon him , said : The time will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews ( and kill them ) ; until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees , which will cry : ‘ O Muslim ! there is a Jew hiding behind me , come and kill him ! '
“ The Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of Israel is an Islamic Waqf , consecrated for future Muslim generations until Judgment Day . It , or any part of it , should not be squandered ; it or any part of it , should not be given up . ”
“ Initiatives and so-called peaceful resolutions and international conferences are in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement …
“ Leaving the circle of struggle with Zionism is high treason and cursed be they who does that … ``
Finally I can cite diatribes from imams in Canada who are frequently exposed calling for death to the Jews in their sermons and describing the Jewish people as “ filth ” .
So do n't tell me , Prime Minister , that I have no right to fear that malignant but widespread strain of Islam that hates Jews .
The Republicans have found a new scapegoat for the economy , in addition to illegal immigrants .
The new scapegoat is public sector workers .
Unwilling to blame Bush for the budget deficit , unable to blame Wall Street for wrecking the economy , and incapable of blaming a lack of regulation or capitalism itself for the morass we 're in , Republicans are pointing their fingers now at public sector workers .
The teachers , police officers , firefighters , and other government employees are just making too much money , the Republicans say , regardless of the fact that public sector workers in state after state have been laid off or put on unpaid furloughs .
But Republicans do n't want you to think about . Much less do they want you to notice that it 's the top 1 percent that 's made off like bandits over the last 30 years . God forbid we raise the marginal income tax rates , or the capital gains tax , or the estate tax .
The last thing Republicans want is to incite class warfare against the upper class . Far better to incite warfare within the middle class and have the majority of Americans blaming each other . ( See “ War on Public Workers , ” by Amy Traub in The Nation , July 5 . )
One Republican politician after another is joining the chorus against public sector workers , whether it 's Scott Brown of Massachusetts or Mitch Daniels of Indiana or Rand Paul of Kentucky or even Arnold Schwarzenegger of California , who has ordered all state workers to get minimum wage until the budget mess there is resolved .
In Wisconsin , where I live , the Wisconsin State Journal just ran a story about public sector workers in Dane County earning more than workers doing similar jobs in the private sector , with at least one local politician complaining about this .
But the average public sector salary is only about $ 35,000 . Are we really going to accept that such a salary is too high ? Shall we just kiss the middle class goodbye ?
Part of this strategy of blaming the public sector worker is mere distraction—a shell game to keep people from focusing on those who are really feasting at the trough : the corporations and the richest of the rich .
And part of it is a calculated attack on unions , since the public sector has a 37.4 percent unionization rate , while the private sector is down at 7.2 percent .
But whatever the motivation , it 's a disgusting strategy .
The next time you hear a politician or a pundit trash public sector workers , ask them if they 'd like to take minimum wage—or even a salary of $ 35,000 .
Chances are , they 're making a lot more than that .

A US trade adviser appointed by Barack Obama orchestrated a deal to buy gold worth millions of dollars from a wanted Congolese warlord , according to a UN report .
Kase Lawal , a Nigerian-born US oil tycoon , transferred millions of dollars to the notorious rebel leader Bosco Ntaganda between December 2010 and February 2011 as part of the deal , the report by the UN 's Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) states .
If true , this would be a contravention of UN resolutions banning individuals or organisations from financing illegal armed groups in the wartorn eastern DRC .
The UN report says Lawal , the chairperson and chief executive of the Houston-based oil firm Camac , was aware they were paying Ntaganda .
Obama put Lawal on the US advisory committee for trade and policy negotiations in September 2010 , just months before the deal with Ntaganda .
All efforts to reach Lawal failed . Camac said it had no comment on the allegations , but said : `` Camac is a law-abiding company and we disagree with the representations made in the report . '' The White House did not respond to a request for comment .
Ntaganda has been wanted by the international criminal court ( ICC ) since an arrest warrant was issued in 2006 . They fund their exploits by smuggling natural resources in the mineral-rich country , and faces allegations of recruiting child soldiers and presiding over mass rapes and murder of civilians by their troops in the National Congress for the Defence of the People ( CNDP ) .
The CNDP militia has since integrated into the Congolese national army but its soldiers continue to obey rebel command structures .
Ntaganda , like many rebel leaders in eastern DRC , funds their activities by smuggling natural resources .
The UN says `` gold is among the sources of financing most readily available to armed groups '' .
According to the report , while Lawal was initially under the impression that they were buying gold from an owner in Kenya , they did not abort the deal when they learned Ntaganda was the true owner .
Instead , the UN report says Lawal merely `` appeared relieved to finally be engaging directly with the true owner of the gold '' .
The report says Lawal financed the deal while Edward Carlos St Mary , a Houston business person and friend of Lawal 's , carried out the transaction in DRC . The deal was proposed to the two men by Dikembe Mutombo , a Congolese former NBA player with the Houston Rockets , and three of their relatives .
Despite paying , Lawal never received the gold . St Mary flew to Goma in DRC to finish the deal in a Camac-leased jet , but the passengers were arrested by Congolese presidential security officers as they tried to take off with the gold in February 2011 .
St Mary and two Camac employees were charged with money-laundering and illegal transport of a banned material , because at this time the Congolese government had banned mining of gold , tin and coltan in the provinces where the minerals trade was affected by illegal armed groups . The three men were released in late March after Camac 's Kinshasa representative paid $ 3m ( £1.9m ) in fines .
Substantial sums of money were involved from the start . The report says Lawal told St Mary they had lost `` $ 30m as a result of the whole ordeal , including transport fees , fines , bribes '' and the payments for the gold .
Jason Stearns , a former Group of Experts co-ordinator , said : `` This is a fine example of the rank disregard of international law by major international companies and business people .
`` Lawal knew Bosco Ntaganda was involved in the deal , so they were knowingly doing business with a man wanted by the ICC . On top of that , there was a Congolese mining ban in place at the time . And finally , he 's probably violating a UN arms embargo on the region . ''
A source close to the UN who asked to remain anonymous said : `` The whole thing was a scam . It 's likely the Congolese were always going to arrest [ St Mary and the others ] and keep the money and the gold . The charge of illegal transport of a banned material was a pretext for the arrests .
`` In reality , the Congolese authorities and Ntaganda worked together to ensure full payment was made for the gold , that the gold never left the DRC , and that the arrested men would have to pay a series of heavy fines to secure their release . ''
St Mary agrees . Speaking to the Guardian from Houston , they said that at one stage they nearly pulled out of the deal , only to be put on the phone to Zoé Kabila , the president 's brother , who reassured them the gold dealers were `` legitimate '' . That was before they knew Ntaganda was involved .
Later , in Goma , St Mary said Ntaganda was arguing with Joseph Kabila , DRC 's president , on the phone . `` They were arguing over how to split the cash , '' they said . `` Even when I first met Ntaganda , they told me he 'd just spoken to Kabila and that we 'd be able to leave with the gold with no problem . ''
When the story first broke in early 2011 Lawal tried to pin the blame on their friend St Mary . Since then , relations have soured between the two men , yet St Mary defends Lawal 's decision to push ahead with the deal . `` Mickey [ Lawal – Kase Lawal 's brother , also in Goma ] and I told [ Kase ] Lawal that the owner of the gold was Bosco [ Ntaganda ] .
`` But by the time we found that out I think our lives were in jeopardy . To try to pull out then could have cost us our lives . In those circumstances , what else can you do ? There was no out .
`` There was only one way to go : try to do a deal and get the hell out of there . The problem was the authorities and Bosco were partners in this , and we did n't know that until it was too late . ''
Conflict persists in eastern DRC , despite a 2003 peace agreement to end a bloody war . Numerous rebel groups and militias operate in the region and there are regular attacks on civilians , including massacres and mass rapes .
Collaboration between Kabila and Ntaganda during the recent presidential and legislative elections lends weight to the accusations .
`` Bosco and the CNDP have allegedly been involved in election fraud while campaigning for Kabila 's Majorité Présidentielle [ coalition ] , '' said Stearns . `` Allegations include ballot-stuffing , stealing people 's identities and intimidation . It 's all been happening in CNDP-controlled areas . ''
A Goma resident who wished to remain anonymous said : `` Bosco and their men are a very visible presence … they put a lot of pressure on people to vote for their favourite candidates . ''
Fraud was so rife that the Congolese electoral commission annulledelection results in some areas .
There are no “ normal ” answers again , so here are some answers from an interview with Anton “ Evilly ” Pankov , WG producer from the Igromir 2014 expo . The interview video can be found here .
- most players of World of Tanks are between 28 and 35 years old
- 95 percent of game time spent in World of Tanks by players is spent in random battles
- from the start , more than 150 thousand clans registered in WoT on RU server alone ( it 's more than 200k overall )
- on RU server , cca 32 percent of players are in clan
- Stronghold mode was introduced for that 32 percent ( easy to understand mode not for hardcore )
- currently , developers are working on improved clan UI
- the option of attacking other strongholds will come in October
- developers are planning to introduce mercenaries from “ allied clans ” in stronghold mode ( not only clanless players )
- there will be a clan “ shop ” in the Stronghold mode . Each clan will have a “ shop ” , where they will be able to buy unique tanks , camouflage and emblems for the SH resource
- developers are also making special Stronghold consumables : aerial recoinaissance , artillery fire mission , air raid , bunkers ( AI turrets ) , these will be used by clan commanders
- these will not be used in random battles : “ as everybody knows , in random battles , you have 29 opponents and to give this to everyone would n't be good ”
- the most effective of those consumables is according to Evilly the aerial recon , because knowing where the opponent is is important
- currently , developers are working on Stalingrad map , making it ready for Havok , it will not come in 9.4
- during map rework for Havok , MANY objects have to be reworked , it 's a lot of work
- Havok will be active on medium ( and higher ) graphic settings , it will work on a separate core ( on multicore processors )

I love LEGO 's DC Super Heroes line , but up until now it 's pretty much been the Batman and Superman show . Coming in January 2015 , Green Lantern vs. Sinestro ( 76025 ) is Hal Jordan 's time to shine . Space Batman is just there to supervise .
After a couple years of buying Batman-themed sets to get the Flash and Aquaman , now I can finally buy a Green Lantern-themed set to get Batman ! This $ 19.95 set gives space police officer Hal Jordan a good reason to need a spaceship — the evil Sinestro has stolen their power ring , leaving them unable to breathe in the vacuum of space !
Diabolical ! How will Hal Jordan get their ring back before Sinestro finally realizes that instead of stealing the ring and running away , they should have stolen the ring and killed their arch-nemesis instead ?

There 's only one person Hal can count on at a time like this — Batman .
Specifically , Space Batman , with their shining silver helmet , rigid space wings and a bouncing platform capable of launching them into Sinestro 's trap , destroying the containment field and restoring Hal Jordan to their former green greatness .

I love it when a LEGO playset has a plan , and that plan comes together .
LEGO will be showing off Green Lantern vs. Sinestro ( 76025 ) this Saturday at the San Diego Comic-Con , as part of a four-day brick-building extravaganza . I 'll drop their full agenda in the comments below , so you can see just how many wonderful opportunities you 're missing by not attending .
• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel confirmed yesterday that the US was reexamining its consistent opposition to arming the Syrian rebels , though cautioned that considering action was not the same as taking action .
“ You look at and rethink all options , '' Secretary Hagel said during a Pentagon news conference , according to The New York Times .
Hagel is the first official to publicly acknowledge the shift that most observers assumed was happening , based on comments earlier this week by President Obama . After Hagel 's press conference , the president said that the defense secretary 's announcement coincided with a view they had held for `` months , '' according to The Daily Star in Lebanon .
The US already provides communication gear and basic rations to Syrian rebels , and could begin including body armor , night-vision goggles , rifles , and other basic arms , The Wall Street Journal reports .
British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond appeared alongside Hagel at the press conference , and said that Britain is also cautiously considering providing arms . A European Union arms embargo on Syria is still in place , but its expiration in May paves the way for a debate on so-called `` lethal aid . ''
`` It 's a rapidly changing situation , '' Mr. Hammond said , according to the Wall Street Journal . `` We 've kept all our options open . We have not thus far provided any arms to the rebels , but we have never said it 's something we will not do . ''
Hammond said that the US and Britain `` have a great deal of knowledge about the location of chemical weapons '' in Syria , but that they have not been able to track all of them , likely because President Bashar al-Assad has ordered them moved around the country .
Although the US has found evidence that the nerve agent sarin gas was used , it has been unable to prove that it was used by regime forces . Some military officials worry that extremist rebel groups may have used the gas to catalyze stronger international support for the opposition , the Wall Street Journal reports .
The extreme caution with which the US and Britain are approaching the issue is likely a reflection of concern about repeating the mistakes in Iraq , in which the US invaded based on intelligence later proven false .
`` There is a strong sense in UK public opinion that we went to war in Iraq on the back of evidence that proved not to be correct , '' Mr. Hammond said . `` In British political space , it is called the dodgy dossier . ''
... `` We have to be absolutely sure we are on firm ground and we 're not looking at another dodgy dossier , '' they said .
However , CNN reports that the level of confidence the Obama administration and Britain want before they commit military aid may be too high a bar , noting that the United Nations ' efforts to launch an independent investigation have so far been blocked .
Yesterday Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also cited the bad intelligence on Iraq and said that the UN should focus on forcing Assad to allow an investigation , according to Bloomberg Businessweek .
“ The blanket authorization to have unimpeded access to any site or any person in Syria resembles very much the Security Council resolutions in Iraq , and we all remember the end of that story , ” Mr. Lavrov said at a press conference .
Even at their most cautious , world leaders seem to be somewhat out of sync with Arab publics on this issue . The Christian Science Monitor reported yesterday that , according to a Pew Research Center poll , Arab citizens remain largely opposed to arming the rebels , either by the US and Europe or other Arab countries .
Eighty percent of Lebanese oppose Western arming of the rebels , and even among Sunnis , who are generally sympathetic to the predominantly Sunni opposition , a solid majority of 66 percent oppose the West sending military aid . Unsurprisingly , almost all ( 98 percent ) of Lebanese Shiites oppose sending arms ; the regime 's base is predominantly Alawite , a Shiite sect . The picture changes slightly when such aid is coming from other Arab countries , but only Lebanese Sunnis join Jordan in supporting the idea – 65 percent of Jordanians favor sending arms and other military supplies , while 63 percent of Lebanese Sunnis do ( to show how starkly divided Lebanon is over the Syrian war , hold that up against the 97 percent of Lebanese Shiites who oppose Arab countries sending military aid ) . The results should be examined with the caveat that the poll was conducted in March , before evidence surfaced that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons .
The New York Times reports that the US shift is not only attributable to a growing conviction that chemical weapons have been used . A senior official said that `` growing confidence '' in Gen. Salim Idriss , who leads the opposition 's Supreme Military Council , is another factor .

FACEBOOK The Avocado ( moonerband @ gmail.com for the address ) Saturday , July 12thFREE | 8pm | All Ages In 2012 , a Nashville-based independent record label sold 3,107,000 copies of Red , the fourth album from singer-songwriter Taylor Swift . So far , Red 's seven singles have charted on Billboard , it has gone platinum in eight countries and it was the second top-selling album of 2012 .
Why did this happen ? How did Swift manage to squeeze water from the rocks of the record buying public ? What is all this hoopla about their boyfriends and how they hate them all ? Are they a salve for authenticity craving audiences everywhere or is they a highly calculated automaton birthed by some brutal capitalist from New York ? I do n't know , man , but read this anyway , I put a lot of time into it .

featuring Taylor Swift 's Red I started listening to Taylor Swift last year , not long after my college friend Mike posted an alarming picture to their Facebook page . Mike is 28 , lives by themselves in suburban Kansas , and , as far as I know , listens primarily to avant-garde electronic pop and hip hop music . They are a passionate defender of nearly every outsider artist I can name . When they and I visited Austin , TX , they were the guy who would take four mile walks to fluorescent-lit industrial districts to see semi-famous Internet musicians blast dissonant static through Marshall halfstacks for small audiences of contemplative stoners . So when they posted a picture that they took of what appeared to be a spotlight-drenched Taylor Swift performing mere feet from him -- accompanied by the caption : `` It was amazing . '' -- my sense of balance in the universe was sent reeling . Mike had just publicly outed himself : they were a Swifty and apparently had been for some time . What does a guy whose idol is Weird Al see in one of the Top Selling Musicians of All Time ? To find out , I decided to put on some Red . Taylor Swift - Red Based on Mike 's tastes , I assumed I would be jumping into Taylor Swift 's `` experimental '' period , something I have a habit of doing with pop artists . If there was one Swift song that made a fan of Mike it must have been an ambient instrumental track or some fourth wall-breaking skit a la The Marshall Mathers LP . Unsurprisingly , there 's nothing like that within Swift 's output . Red is truly and thoroughly a pop album and it serves as an oversized monument to it 's creator : a very gifted songwriter operating at the peak of their powers . ( I say oversized only because I do n't think there should have been 16 songs on this thing but that 's really my only complaint about this overall very good album . ) In Red , Swift devotes their formidable talent to expanding their sound and to taking some risks and , to me , that makes the album worth looking at .
One of the things that really grinds my gears about critics of Swift are their tendency to reduce them to The Songwriter of Young , Idealistic Women Everywhere or as the emobodiment of the `` shadowy area between teenager and womanhood . '' Them songwriting accomplishments , however impressive , always seem to be discolored by insularity . Them 2006 debut is admittedly mostly about football games and making out in trucks but even as their songwriting has progressed beyond their high school years they have never fully shed the first impressions made by doe-eyed ballads like `` Love Story . '' I think that Swift is more potent and accessible than even their own audience has indicated and Red is as close as they got to owning up to this and redefining their career . At some point after their smash 2010 album Fearless , they clearly are fed up with the well meaning but condescending critical consensus , niche marketing campaigns and Tim McGraw opening slots . Two years later , they decided to take a big step toward their ultimate goal : total pop domination . Taylor Swift - We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together The song that first alerted the universe that Taylor had `` Gone Pop '' is the single `` We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together . '' First and foremost about this : if anyone insists to you that `` We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together '' is not one of the greatest pop songs of the last ten years I want you to immediately stare back at them with unbearable intensity , draw your index finger slowly across your neck and quietly mouth `` I do n't know you . '' `` We Are Never ... '' is a pants-shitting pop masterpiece . Penned by Swift and accompanied by Max Martin 's strikingly minimalist arrangement the song is one whopping shot of acoustic singer-songwriter confessional couched within a pristine electro-country rock dance number . It 's highly fussed over , Frankenstein 'd from multiple of-the-moment pop influences and has some cringeworthy spoken-word stuff . But it 's also got the one thing that that any mega-hit absolutely has to have : it 's catchier than the catchiest thing that you have ever thought in your life .
As for the lyrics , I do n't want to hear a word about how it 's a `` charming ode to breaking up '' or how it 's some sort of feminist-lite empowerment schlock . The simple fact that Swift is writing about a breakup from the female perspective instead of the male does n't suddenly make the song exceptional and , despite assurance from popular criticism , it is n't the thing that makes Swift unique as a songwriter . What makes them special is the same thing that makes Bono , Fiona Apple , Stevie Wonder and Bruno fucking Mars special : they can take a specific and personal moment and instantly connect with a big audience without losing much nuance or detail . They have written them `` The Sweetest Thing '' , `` Gim me Shelter '' or `` Pastime Paradise . '' These songs are n't still around just because they had mass appeal for a minute a few decades ago . Thousands of people still remember them because they tap into the few commonalities between people and filter them through a personal experience causing a contradictory connection between strangers that is both intimate and general . These songs about specific moments in the personal life of the writer -- e.g . protesting war , upsetting one 's spouse , American race relations in the mid-70s -- are successful in finding an audience because they invite listeners to project onto them images of their own personal lives . `` We Are Never ... '' is ostensibly about a breakup , but it could be about leaving your job , moving to a new city or any other declaratory change in your life . It 's a concept that transcends gender , age and contextual barriers and it 's what makes a bedrock for any pop song . You might think that the songs I mentioned are pandering or obnoxious but they 're also as rare as unicorns and that makes them special . I think that Stevie Nicks nailed it when they said that Swift writes `` songs that make the whole world sing , like Neil Diamond or Elton John . '' While I would n't toss them up next to Rocket Man in the pantheon of great populist songwriters , they clearly have Elton-esque visions of pop ubiquity in mind and I think they have the talent and brains to distill the Big Topics into universally-affecting chart-toppers , not just quaint `` For Girls , By Girls '' novelty songs . Red was Taylor 's shot at expanding their fan base from a niche to a whole world of moms , dads , siblings and pretentious dudes like me . For an album that so harshly deals with messy internal conflict -- desire vs. needs , confidence vs. vulnerability , fear of transition -- it 's kind of amazing that it found a home with over 3 million listeners . The feel-good album of the year this was n't , yet it was still blasted from every car stereo at the same frequency that Adele 's 21 appeared in one 's solitary earbuds or in tearful Grey 's Anatomy death sequences or some other hoo-hah .
And I guess that what Mike likes about Taylor , too ? I 'm still not sure , Mike really is a bit of an enigma .

FORT DRUM — About 500 soldiers from post , recently returned from Afghanistan , are currently locked down in their battalion space due to missing equipment .
The lockdown of the 4th Battalion , 31st Infantry Regiment , began Friday afternoon , following the discovery that a night-vision device , valued from $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 , was unaccounted for .
The item was signed for at the company commander level , and an investigation is underway to determine what happened to the item .
Post spokesperson Julie Halpin said the lockdown is standard procedure when equipment goes missing , and that all levels of battalion leadership fall under the lockdown . The lockdown will continue indefinitely until the item is recovered .
“ I ca n't imagine a worse time for an accountable item to go missing than when our soldiers and families are reuniting after a successful deployment , ” they said .
The soldiers , who returned to the north country at the beginning of February , are sleeping on cots and eating Meals Ready to Eat packages .
The soldiers ' duty days are taking place as scheduled , Mrs. Halpin said .
One spouse of a soldier under the lockdown , whom The Times is not identifying to protect their spouse from retribution , said there was a sense of frustration for many after being apart from their loved ones for months . The spouse relayed that many of their military friends found the timing and scale of the lockdown was “ ridiculous . ”
“ I ca n't even imagine for mothers , who finally thought they 'd get a break , that their husband would help out with their kids , ” the spouse said .
Many of the soldiers were recalled to post as late at 1:30 a.m. Saturday morning , the spouse said , forcing them to find rides to post if they were drinking Friday night . Other soldiers struggled to find daycare for their children as the lockdown went into effect .
The battalion 's leadership was recently featured on a segment with Stephen Colbert on CBS 's “ The Late Show . ”
The lockdown has captured attention online , including the Facebook page “ U.S . Army W.T.F ! moments . ”
The disappearance of a pair of night-vision goggles led to a two-day lockdown for soldiers from C Company , 2nd Battalion , 14th Infantry Regiment in April .
Soldiers from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the 277th Aviation Support Battalion spent seven days in lockdown in 2013 after 100 bayonets and 800 scopes , valued at about $ 50,000 , went missing .
Israel and the Palestinian Authority reached a compromise agreement on Friday that will effectively end the crisis regarding the tax revenues that Israel has been withholding from the PA , as well as the crisis regarding Palestinian debt to the Israel Electric Company , Haaretz has learned .
The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories , Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai , met on Friday with their Palestinian Authority counterpart . Their meeting resulted in the Palestinians agreeing to receive the tax revenue withheld by Israel from December to February as a result of the Palestinian effort to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague .
The Palestinians also agreed to a `` major offsetting '' of roughly half a billion shekels that Israel withheld from tax revenues collected between December and February , meant primarily to repay debts to the Israel Electric Company .
According to an understanding reached between the two sides , Israel will significantly reduce the amount withheld from March and April tax revenues to offset the Palestinian debt . Going forward , Israeli and Palestinian representatives will continue to discuss the remaining debt as well as both sides ' obligations .
The initial transfer of 1.5 billion shekels - minus 500 million shekels to pay electricity debt - represents the tax revenues collected for the months of December , January and February . Tax revenue collected by Israel for the PA during March and April amounts to an additional 1 billion shekels . 850 million of which will be transferred to the PA , with the rest used to further offset Palestinian electricity debt . As a result of the compromise agreement , the Palestinian Authority has agreed to accept a total of 1.85 billion shekels .
On March 27 , a week and a half after the Israeli election , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acted on recommendations from defense officials and decided to transfer roughly 1.5 billion shekels ( $ 383 million ) in tax revenue that was withheld following the Palestinian bid to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague .
Netanyahu 's decision followed significant pressure from Israeli defense officials , as well as the United States and the European Union , in light of the dire financial straits in the West Bank , and fears that the economic crisis would lead to chaos or the collapse of the Palestinian Authority . Netanyahu 's decision to transfer the funds also followed their election win , which effectively released them from domestic political considerations .

After Israel announced that it would release the funds , however , the Palestinians refused to accept them amidst claims that Israel had decided to withhold a relatively large portion of the funds to offset some of the Palestinian debt to the Israel Electric Company , which sits at roughly 1.5 billion shekels .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said then that the Israeli decision to withhold such a large amount of the tax revenue to offset the debt was made unilaterally , without any Palestinian involvement , and in violation of agreements between the two sides . Abbas even threatened to seek international mediation , or assistance from the International Criminal Court in The Hague should Israel withhold the funds .
Despite the Palestinians ' refusal to receive the funds , Israel unilaterally transferred tax funds collected in December , January and February , but withheld half a billion shekels to partly offset the electricity debt . A few days later , Abbas claimed that they had issued an order to return the funds because Israel withheld a third of the amount – 500 million shekels out of 1.5 billion . `` Either they return the full amount to us , or we 'll seek international mediation , or the ICC , '' Abbas said then .
Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah said that there has been recent contact between joint Israeli-Palestinian economic committees looking into PA debt owed to Israeli companies , in order to avoid unilateral moves to offset debt by withholding funds , as Israel has done in recent months .
PA officials also noted that after the tax revenues are transferred in full , debts to Palestinian Authority officials will be paid after months of receiving only partial salaries . PA employees should receive their April salaries in full .
OLYMPIA , Wash. - Puget Sound Energy and staff from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission are defending their proposed settlement on the 2016 natural gas explosion in Seattle 's Greenwood neighborhood .
It includes what the state says is the largest fine ever imposed on a pipeline incident .
$ 1.5 million is what PSE is agreeing to pay in fines and it 's agreeing to check thousands of gas lines to insure their safety .
It 's work that has already started . Work crews are out inspecting and fixing natural gas lines that have been retired and no longer being used .
This comes in response to the disastrous explosion of March 9 , 2016 . More than a dozen businesses were damaged , some of them destroyed , and nine firefighters were injured when an unused natural gas pipeline exploded .
It was determined a private contractor working for PSE improperly capped the line after it was no longer being used in 2004 .
`` We concur that violations occurred , '' testified Catherine Koch of PSE . `` We 're determined to prevent another Greenwood explosion . ''
On Monday PSE and staff members of the state UTC testified in Olympia about the settlement proposal reached in March .
PSE would be fined $ 2.75 million , but all but $ 1.5 million would be suspended if PSE inspects and repairs 40,000 retired natural gas service lines . The money goes into a fund to promote pipeline regulation and safety projects .
`` If it were to come out that way that would be the largest penalty that the pipeline safety staff has ever administered , '' Alan Rathbun , UTC pipeline safety manager said at the hearing .
`` If PSE does follow through and makes sure this can not happen again , like absolutely makes sure , then I think it 's a fair penalty , '' said Chaco Canyon Organic Cafe owner Chris Maykut ,
But , none of the settlement money would go to the businesses . PSE is handling them separately . At last report PSE said eight of 15 claims have been dealt with .
`` As far as our business and how PSE has taken care of us subsequently , at least recently , we are pretty satisfied , '' said Maykut .
At the hearing there was questioning by Public Counsel attorneys representing citizens inferring the settlement is n't harsh enough .
But , if the settlement is modified , PSE said there 's a chance it will pull out of it .
The commissioners will take what they heard and make a decision in the near future .

We 've talked a lot in the past about the development of Sonic Boom , since its release , former employees of Big Red Button have posted tons of early development material regarding it 's development which indicate it was once a much larger and very different game .
One such piece of evidence was a photograph taken inside Big Red Button showing what appeared to be an old logo for the game , however the name was n't quite clear and since then nobody has confirmed the name .
However , we now know what it is . Sonic Synergy was the original title for Sonic Boom , both the Wii U and 3DS version .
According to a website for Edward Moore who was a UX/UI design consultant for Sonic Boom , Boom was once entitled Sonic Synergy .
They describe their input on Boom as
High level User Experience & UI Design , Flash/Actionscript implementation for the majority of HUD elements , and Localization Production and Debugging .
Along with this are two UI diagrams for both the Wii U and 3DS version of Boom , these diagrams both contain the original Sonic Synergy title screen , and other early concept artwork for the game .
In addition to this , there 's evidence to suggest that Boom Sonic looked a lot different .
Sonic 's arms are back to being tan in colour , spikes are also different , much more like the Sega Sonic version . Amy also has some differences too .
What do you think ? Sonic Synergy ? Good title ? Bad title ? And Sonic 's alternative design ? Like it , Hate it ? Let us know in the comments .

They defeated them in a grueling Democratic nomination battle . Then they pursued their agenda across the world as secretary of state . Now , the delicate relationship between Hillary Rodham Clinton and President Obama is about to get even more complicated .
For months , Mrs. Clinton and their team have pored over Mr. Obama 's poll ratings , policies and constituencies , seeking to solve a central riddle for the campaign they are about to begin : How can they run for president as their own person , without criticizing the sitting president they served — while their Republican opponents will be working to demonize them both ?
Aligning themselves too closely with Mr. Obama is fraught with risk for Mrs. Clinton . Asked to imagine their “ perfect candidate , ” nearly six in 10 Americans said they wanted someone who would change most of Mr. Obama 's policies , according to a CNN poll released last month . And Republicans are betting that attacks based on the incumbent 's record will be as effective against Mrs. Clinton as the tactic was in 2008 , when Democrats equated a victory by Senator John McCain to four more years of President George W. Bush .
“ That 's the anchor she 'll be dragging for the next couple of years , ” said Stuart Stevens , who was a top strategist for Mitt Romney , the 2012 Republican nominee .
We all know what it 's like to fear that one of our makeup products will break or shatter to pieces . It 's even worse when it actually happens and we 're left with a broken lip gloss tube or crushed up powders . Sure , the geniuses of the beauty world have been quick to find hacks for these types of disasters , but it 's usually not a fun process .
Beauty blogger , Gina Kay , found one way to turn a broken highlighting powder into something else they love — pizza .
They shared the mini pizza pie on their Instagram account . According to the photo caption , they created their masterpiece using loose shimmer powders and rubbing alcohol . The end result ? A shiny pie of pizza with pepperoni included as a topping . Gina even managed to carve the powder into eight individual slices .
Gina also shared a video of what the highlighter looked like once applied , and the glow could n't be brighter .
In a time where adding illumination to your beauty routine is a must , Gina could have started the next big trend . We 've seen rainbow highlighter , thermal highlighter , and now pizza highlighter . We 're really curious as to what 's next .

Fifteen students who enrolled at the for-profit Corinthian Colleges , which runs Everest Institute , are going on a “ debt strike. ” ( AP/Jose Luis Magana )
Mallory Heiney is a member of the Corinthian 15 , a group that is refusing to repay student debt incurred at the now-defunct Everest College .
In 2013 , I entered college to become a licensed practical nurse . I chose the Grand Rapids , Mich. , campus of Everest , owned by Corinthian Colleges , because it promised me a high-quality program that I could finish quickly . I was eager to get my nursing degree so I could pursue my dream of working in a health clinic in Africa .
Within a few months , I was deeply in debt for an education that fell far below my expectations . Recently , I joined with other former Everest students in refusing to repay our federal and private student loans . We 're calling ourselves the Corinthian 15 .
The list of Everest 's alleged false promises and defrauded students is long . At its height , Corinthian Colleges operated more than 100 Everest , Heald and WyoTech schools throughout the United States and Canada . Most of those schools have since been closed or purchased by another company . In the past eight years , Corinthian has been the target of some 200 lawsuits filed by state and federal agencies . Last month , the company received a letter that it would be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market for failing to file financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission . In many news stories about the company , Corinthian has n't commented about the pending lawsuits .
In October 2013 , California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris filed a lawsuit against Corinthian alleging that the company violated consumer protection and securities laws . About a year later , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) filed a lawsuit accusing Corinthian of predatory lending , including strong-arming students into enrolling and engaging in illegal debt collection tactics such as withholding diplomas and books .
I experienced these kinds of tactics first-hand . During the enrollment process , I explained to an Everest financial adviser that I could not afford to make loan payments while attending school . I was reassured that I would not be required to repay my loans until after I graduated . They quickly signed me up for federal and privately held loans . By graduation , I owed more than $ 24,000 .
Two months into my program , I received my first loan bill . That 's when I learned that I was expected to pay the interest on my private loan debt while in school . Soon I was selling my plasma twice a week to buy groceries and make my interest-only payments .
The program also lacked the quality I had been promised by Everest 's admissions staff . Classes consisted mostly of teachers reading aloud from books . After I earned my degree , I did not have the knowledge I needed to pass the state licensing exam . I eventually passed it by spending hours researching the test questions online and watching YouTube videos .
According to the Higher Education Act of 1965 , students enrolled in schools that are closing are to be given the option to withdraw and have their loans discharged . I wrote a letter to the university president , demanding that I be allowed to take advantage of this “ closed school discharge. ” My request was denied because I was too far into the 12-month program : I was almost done with the program at this point , and I would still be expected to repay my loans .
Soon , by connecting with other students on Facebook and reading news articles about the school , I discovered that thousands of students had been caught in Everest 's debt trap . Through social media and with the support of the Debt Collective , a group related to the Occupy movement , hundreds of current and former Corinthian students have been demanding that the Department of Education discharge our federal loans .
The Department of Education says its mission is “ to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access. ” Where was the Department of Education when Corinthian began preying on students ? Corinthian Colleges had the option to threaten bankruptcy , sell its campuses and wash its hands of its financial problems . But students are stuck with their debt .
The Department of Education has the authority to discharge student loans when colleges defraud students . The department makes a profit on student debt , and is projected to take in $ 127 billion over the next decade , according to the Congressional Budget Office . While the CFPB has negotiated a reduction in the amount of private loans that Corinthian students will have to pay back , the Department of Education has yet to take action on the federal loans .
By using our debt as leverage , we 're making our voices heard . We are not asking for a handout . We are demanding justice for students ensnared in a debt trap .
Of course , a debt strike comes with many potential consequences . Refusing to pay back our loans means the federal government can garnish our wages and tax refunds ; our credit scores will also take a hit .
While our cause is modest by comparison , we recognize that some of the greatest human rights movements in history were launched by the small acts of a few individuals . After voting in the 1872 national election , Susan B. Anthony was arrested and convicted of “ illegal voting ” while fighting for their right to vote . It took until 1920 for women to receive the right to vote . In 1955 , Rosa Parks refused to give up their seat on a bus . This soon led to the revolutionary Montgomery bus boycott .
If those who came before us can take a stand in the face of persecution , harassment , beatings , imprisonment and even death , I will certainly stand in the face of wage garnishment and a tarnished credit report .
[ it 's with sadness and hope in my heart that i wrote this . i am so sorry for all of those who have suffered . who are reminded of what they lost every single day . // do n't forget to read the “ 10 Things ” at the bottom of this post , written and shared to Facebook by Linda Lajterman of Ramsey , NJ who recently lost their son , Danny , to heroin and is featured in the middle picture above . ]
Ramsey , NJ — where the 1 % live , and where $ 1M will buy you a humble home . It 's where teenagers are gifted new BMW 's on their 17th birthday , and the award winning school districts are comprised of mostly white privileged students .
So why is it that in this picturesque town , heroin is rampant ? Why is it that 41 people have died in the past year and a half from heroin in Ramsey , and the surrounding towns ?
It was my first year in college when heroin took my first friend — Andrew Krone ( 2nd from right in cover photo ) . The details of their death shook my heart to pieces . A couple years later it took my friend David Misley ( far right in cover photo ) , who was dropped off by their “ friends ” and left to die overnight in the snow in front of their house .
This year it took my little sisters friend , and younger sibling of a classmate of mine , Daniel Lajterman .
I remember the first time I saw heroin . I was a junior in high school and was invited to a party with friends . When I walked down the stairs to the basement I noticed everyone acting weird . Not a marijuana-high weird , but a slow , zombie-like , confused and helpless weird .
“ Are they on painkillers or something ? ” I asked .
“ Better , ” they said with a side smirk . “ Heroin . Want some ? ”
My heart jumped into my throat , but I held my cool and just shrugged my shoulders . “ Nah , I 'm good. ” All I could think was heroin ? Here ? Now ? Them ? Me ? WHAT ? ! [ note : I have never done heroin ]
When people think of heroin they do n't think of the popular guy at school -they do n't think of their neighbor who drive an Escalade or lives in the country club . But this is exactly who is using and abusing heroin in Bergen County , NJ . Forget racial profiling — for too many , being around drugs and abusing drugs is just…normal in New Jersey . You 'd never know it . It 's the cheerleaders and football players and band members . It 's the valedictorian and the hippie chick . For too many it 's not a matter of experimenting with hard drugs — it 's a matter of whether or not experimenting will kill you or lead to addiction .
WAKE UP NEW JERSEY . HEROIN KILLS . IF YOU DO HEROIN YOU WILL DIE .
Scroll up and look at the cover photo . This can happen to anyone .
Knowing what I know now , I ca n't believe that I was that girl that just said , “ nah , I 'm good ” like it was n't a big deal . I ca n't believe I was that girl that did n't say anything .
If your friends are doing heroin — tell their parents . Tell your counselor . You 're not a rat . They wo n't hate you . You 'll be saving their lives .
If you do n't say anything I can tell you how it ends . Your friend ( s ) will most likely die . Their parents will suffer and it will be almost impossible for you to watch them try to live through the pain . They never get over it . You 'll never forgive yourself for feeling partially responsible for their death .
And then every once in a while you 'll see a comment posted to your friends wall , even though they 've passed on , reminding you that you should have spoken up . “ I never thought it would be this hard to live without you ” or “ Heard our song the other day — I still ca n't believe you are gone ” . A decade will go by , and people will still be posting . You 'll get married , you 'll have kids , and people will still be posting .
I 'm angry . And I 'm sad . And I 'm confused . I do n't understand why year after year good people die because of bad choices . Andrew , David , Daniel…they were all good kids . Popular , nice , smart…had every opportunity in the world laying at their fingertips . Most importantly — they all came from good families . Wake up New Jersey — this can happen to anyone .
Please read the letter below , and please share with your friends and your family . It does n't matter if you 're 15 or 60 , if you know someone abusing heroin , or even thinking about trying it for the first time , intervene and get them help immediately . Heroin is extremely addicting — you do n't just “ try it once ” . Whatever you do , do n't stand by , shrug your shoulders and say , “ nah , I 'm good. ” Let 's get the heroin out of New Jersey .
Soak up every letter of every word that Linda wrote below . You know this was written with the heaviest of hearts . I ca n't even imagine . No one should ever have to . They did n't have to die . They did n't have to die .
Dear Friends ,
It 's been almost one month since we lost our Danny . I vowed their death will not be just another drug related casualty and yet I do n't have the strength to use my voice to reach out to others . I thought of starting a blog but ca n't get it going . I have a message to parents and young people about what we learned so the best way to get it out is for everyone who reads this post to share it and hopefully our experience can save another life . Here is what we learned :
1 . This can happen to anyone . No socioeconomic barriers exist . Every time you smoke weed , or use what is perceived as recreational drug , there is a chance that it is tainted with a substance that can kill .
2 . The drug dealer is not always the creepy inner city guy or some bad kid from town ; it could be your next door neighbor , a father of children your kid 's ages .
3 . Most teens do n't think anything bad will ever happen to them . They often think they are in control of the situation and are just “ partying ” . Parents do n't think it will happen in their family . Drugs and my kid “ never ” ! WAKE UP EVERYONE ; what was considered recreational drug use just a few years ago is completely different now . Coke , Molly , Xanax , Shrooms , Acid , Weed and any form of pain killers are the NORM . Do n't worry so much about locking up your liquor cabinet ; lock your medicine cabinet first . We spoke to many of Danny 's friends after their death to try to make sense of what happened . Kids today speak a different language regarding what is normal . We were in shock at how blatantly they talked about using these drugs as if they were having a pizza . It is a different world today . My older kids were as shocked as we are . One is 29 the other is 27 . What is normal now was considered crossing the line when they were in college ! Danny was n't out of high school a year before they died .
4 . You can have the best environment and the happiest of families . Your child could be abusing or addicted drugs and you might not even know it . Danny came from a very happy home ; parents who are married over 30 years and still love each other as we did 30 years ago . They had an older brother and sister who adored them and watched over them like a parent . Grandmothers , aunts , uncles , cousins . A very tight , happy and loving family . We ca n't wrap our heads around this ; you think there has to be some type of family drama or problem that would cause your child to start using any type of drug . It does n't ! If drugs grab hold of your child , it is a demon you may not even be aware of until something drastic occurs .
5 . You can talk to your kids about drugs , schools can educate them ; it usually does n't help or work in most cases . You 're lucky if your kid learned something from the education process . Danny had all the lectures , education and information from school , their family , their siblings , their cousins and from families we know with kids with drug abuse problems There are many families who are experiencing the in and out of rehab hell ; a hell we would gladly visit if we were given the chance . Unfortunately , most of you know what happened to him . Go re-read lessons 1 and 2 . We talked constantly about what was going on out there from our limited knowledge base . That is one of the problems ; as parents most of us do n't even know what to look for when you would never put the words drugs and your kid in the same sentence . Remember , Danny did n't start smoking weed alone . I am sure they did n't experiment with other substances alone either . Your kid may be trying different party drugs and you would n't even know it .
6 . Teenagers are very skilled at half truths . There is a fine line between trusting your kid and becoming a maniac who is following the teens every move . My son told me everything I wanted to hear to ensure they were okay and not doing anything stupid . They even told me about an intervention their friends had after New Years for some of their buddies . I knew all about it ! They left out the part that they were being intervened as well . They told me about the amount of partying their friends were doing at college when they came home for winter break and how many of them have changed . They trained us to leave them alone . As the parents of a 19 year old , we had no reason not to trust them so we gave them the freedom to act like a first year college student .
7 . Right under our nose our son was using drugs . I work from home for the past 18 years . My office is two feet from their bedroom . I am home all the time . There was not one sign that could not be considered a typical teenage action . Danny went to school , they went to work at their part time job , and they had a girlfriend they adored . They ate dinner with us every night . They called home and reached out to us whenever they were out . They called me every day on their way home from school to see what we were having for dinner . They had conversations with us when they felt like it . They told us they loved us every single day . Sounds normal right ? They never took money from my purse , occasionally they would take my debit card but I could see exactly what they did ; fast food and gas in their car . They got angry once in a while , what teenager does n't ? They slept late and stayed up late ; typical college student behavior . Does that sound like a drug abuser ? Not to us especially after having gone through the teenage years with our older kids .
8 . There is tremendous shame and embarrassment felt by kids when they recognize they have a substance abuse problem . They may have done terrible things to get money to buy drugs . These feelings of shame can prevent them from seeking help from the people who love them and would do anything for them . We learned a great deal about our son after their death that I know , 100 % , would cause them to be scared out of their mind to tell us . Parents know that parental love is unconditional but many kids do n't understand it . It is that fear of what may happen if their parents find out that holds them back from being truthful . We thought we had an open relationship with Danny where they could tell us anything ( mom and siblings especially ) . If they had not been given a lethal dose of homemade drugs , we most likely would have only found out if they told us , someone else told us , or if they got arrested . We found out when we broke down their bedroom door . Parents , please reinforce unconditional love to your kids . Let them know that no matter what they have done or are doing , you will be there for them . It may be disappointing and embarrassing , but you can save your kids life . We wish we had the chance to at least try .
9 . The unwritten CODE OF TEENAGERS is to keep silent about anything you know that may cause you lose a friend . This is the way it is and the way it always was . We all have to learn a new code , a code that can save a life . Having a friend be mad at you is different than having a friend or their child that is dead . You only lose a friend when they are gone forever . That friend will thank you some day and their family may be spared the agony my family is living through right now . Re-read number 3 . There is a new normal out there that is beyond most of our comprehension . Anyone who knows their friends are making bad choices , using drugs that are deadly or parents who know their kids are using drugs but did n't reach out to warn the parents of their friends to look out : BREAK the CODE ; open up your mouth and tell their families . It was n't until Danny died that we found out how many of their friends knew what they were doing . We also learned that one of their friends , a friend they had since age 6 , was in a day rehab . Their mother did n't call me and warn me to look out for my son . I would have done that for them if I was the one that found out first . Them son is now in rehab and can try to get a new start ; Danny did n't get that chance . We did n't get a chance to help our son . Had someone tipped us off , it may have taken a while to process but we would at least been looking out for signs . Schools and police departments have a place in this at some point , but first and foremost , kids should have a safe method of informing so they will actually do it . Be creative , find ways within your communities to let kids know they need to BREAK the CODE and tell someone . They can save a life .
10 . For those of you who are lucky enough to have the opportunity to help your child DO N'T MESS IT UP ! ! ! Get them into rehab . Do what you need to save them . If you need to move to a new area to get them away from their friends , DO IT . Help them get the support they need through groups , counseling etc . Be there for them every step of the way now and forever . We did n't get the chance to help our Danny . We ca n't help but be somewhat jealous of those families that can at least try . I spoke to families that are living the “ in and out of rehab hell ” and I swear , we would take that hell over our hell any day . Both are horrible but your kids are alive , our son is not . I ca n't even describe the pain my family is experiencing right now and how our lives are changed forever . If you are lucky enough to get the chance , do it right ! !
Unfortunately , many kids have very short memories for a local tragedy . We saw real and true tears at Danny 's funeral from many of the hundreds of kids who came . We have also learned that a few days later , many were back to business as usual waiting for the next chance to get wasted at whatever excuse there is for a party . Some kids learned a lesson , many did n't learn a thing . Please share this with everyone on your friend list and parents , please recognize it does n't just happen to other people , it can happen to you . We thought the same thing and will now have to live with broken hearts for the rest of our lives . Please learn from our experience and hopefully help your child or friend before it is too late .
Sincerely ,
Linda Lajterman
On Any Sunday is a 1971 American documentary film about motorcycle sport , directed by Bruce Brown . It was nominated for a 1972 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature . [ 1 ] Brown tried to show the unique talents needed for the different forms of racing . For instance , the motocross riders were typically free-spirited types , while desert racers were often loners . In Grand National racing , Brown showed widely differing personalities , such as the business-like approach to racing displayed by Mert Lawwill versus the carefree approach that David Aldana became known for . [ 2 ]
In addition to Lawwill , Steve McQueen is featured in the film , along with Malcolm Smith and many other motorcycle racers from the late 1960s and early 1970s .
Motorcycle brands featured in the film include Triumph , Montesa , Husqvarna , Harley-Davidson , Honda , Yamaha , Suzuki , BSA , Bultaco , and Hodaka .
Production [ edit ]
The film was financially backed , in part , by McQueen [ 3 ] through their `` Solar Productions company '' , which received credit in the final seconds of the film . Some of the more dramatic shots were extreme closeup slow-motion segments of the Grand National races . From their surfing movie days , Brown was used to working with super telephoto lenses . The budget did n't allow the expense of high-speed cameras , so Brown improvised by using 24-volt batteries in the 12-volt film cameras . The result was a makeshift high-speed camera . Brown also used a helmet camera on some of the riders , which had not been widely attempted previously due to the bulk of film cameras of the day .
Regarding their filming method , Brown said :
At times I 'd have a particular shot in mind . For example , I wanted to shoot a muddy motocross race and show the riders with mud all over them . First you have to be at a motocross race when it rains , then you have to find a good location to shoot . We tried and tried to get a shot with a rider caked with mud . We finally did get the shot , but for a while it seemed like we never would .
At one point , Brown found a perfect location for a sunset beach riding shot—Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton .
I figured there would be no way to get approval to film on the Marine base , '' Brown recalls . `` Steve McQueen said he 'd see what they could find out . The next day they called and was told to contact some General and the next thing you know we are shooting the beach sequences . It was pretty amazing the doors they were able to open . [ 2 ]
Critical reception [ edit ]
On Any Sunday is often credited as the best and/or most important motorcycle documentary ever made . `` [ 4 ] Roger Ebert says it `` does for motorcycle racing what The Endless Summer did for surfing '' . Ebert praises the film 's high level of artistry in accomplishing the impressive footage of motorcycle races ( which they say are difficult to film ) , and they also credit the film for not bothering viewers with the technical details of how the filming was done . [ 3 ]
Impact [ edit ]
During the opening sequence , children are seen riding their bicycles on a dirt track , in imitation of motorcyclists . Thanks to this scene , On Any Sunday is thought to have popularized BMX biking across America ; previously it had only been observed in Southern California . [ 5 ] Brown themselves also believed the film changed public perception of motorcycle racers as `` bad guys '' ( as depicted in popular films like The Wild One ) to popular heroes . [ 2 ]
Malcolm Smith credits their appearance in On Any Sunday with giving them the worldwide recognition that enabled them to become a leading entrepreneur in the off-road motorcycling business . [ 2 ]
Several follow-ups to the film were produced :
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain 's job market is defying the Brexit blues but wages are still in the dumps , data showed , suggesting the Bank of England will tread carefully on Thursday with any signals about when it may finally raise interest rates .

The sub-inflation pay growth could also add to the pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May to raise public sector wages , a day after they agreed to ease seven years of salary constraints - but only modestly and only for some state workers .
Wednesday 's data underscored how the economy is no longer following the once widely agreed rules on the link between job creation and pay growth , creating a headache for the government in Britain and other rich economies around the world .
Britain 's problem is all the more acute because inflation looks set to hit a five-year high of 3 percent soon , caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since last year 's shock referendum decision to leave the European Union .
The Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4.3 percent in the three months to July , helped by the strongest job creation since 2015 .
That took the jobless rate further below the 4.5 percent level which the BoE has said would probably force employers to step up their pay increases to hire staff .
But wages rose by a modest annual 2.1 percent , weaker than a median forecast of 2.3 percent in a Reuters poll of economists and the latest in a long line of disappointing earnings figures .
The value of the pound fell on Wednesday as investors took the wage data as a sign that the BoE , which is due to make its latest policy announcement at 1100 GMT on Thursday , was unlikely to significantly strengthen its message that a rate hike could come sooner than financial markets have been thinking .
“ Today 's wage data suggests all is still not right in the economy , ” Ed Monk of fund manager Fidelity International said .
BANK OF ENGLAND DECISION
Only two BoE policymakers have been voting for an immediate rise in rates from a record low of 0.25 percent back to 0.50 percent , their emergency level for almost all of the decade since the global financial crisis .
They say the fall in unemployment will push up prices and inflation soon .
Some economists say BoE chief economist Andy Haldane will join the minority of dissenters this week , signalling a shift in thinking at the central bank that could lead to a rate hike at its subsequent meeting in November .
However , most economists do not expect a rate rise until 2019 . They think inflation will move only a little higher before slowly fading next year as Britain 's economy is subdued by the approach of its divorce from the EU in 2019 .
In real terms , wages have been falling since April and dropped by an annual 0.4 percent in the three months to July .
Part of the weak wage growth reflects a seven-year policy of public-sector wage restraint to help cut government borrowing .
Britain 's government - aware of the frustration among many voters over their squeezed spending power - partially eased its grip on pay on Tuesday when it said it would no longer limit wage rises for police and prison guards to the 1 percent cap for the public sector .
But even the pay offer for these two groups remains below inflation , and the government has made no extra money available to fund the increase , suggesting a squeeze on services .
Public-sector trade unions are considering coordinated strike action to push for pay rises greater than inflation .
Even if the government is forced into increases for more public sector workers than announced this week , the overall impact is likely to be muted : Public sector workers account for about 5 million of the 32 million people in employment in Britain .
I should probably have written this sooner as it has been 10 days since Beta 3 was released , but I 've only just noticed that there is a bit of traffic still coming in about Swift Arrays from my earlier posts about the array semantics in the first Swift betas . The short version is that I 'm very happy with the new Swift Arrays in Beta 3 which have full value semantics ( optimised with copy on write under the hood ) . The syntax for declaring arrays has also changed which is fine although I did n't have a particular problem with the old syntax . Be sure to update the Swift iBooks ( delete and download again ) as there are some significant changes .
The copy ( ) and unshare ( ) functions are gone because unshare has essentially become the default behaviour ( although contents changes not just length changes now trigger the copy so copy is not needed either ) .
Semantic Changes
Arrays are no longer reference types . You can treat every assignment , argument pass and function return as if it were a copy . Changing the contents of an array is no longer permitted when the array is declared constant with let .
In this example you can see the copy-on-write ( CoW ) behaviour using the identity operator ( === which I would n't recommend you doing in real code to affect behaviour on the CoW status but it enables us to observe the CoW ) . In the example it does n't make any difference if a is declared with let or var but b must be declared as var otherwise you will get a compiled time error because the contents change .
Note that if the array contains objects ( of classes ) the objects themselves are fully accessible and can be mutated just as with any object of that class even if the array is declared with let . What you ca n't do is change or reorder which objects are within the array .
With structs , dictionaries and other value types they can not be mutated when within an array declared with let although they can be copied to a variable . This code would give a compile error if e was declared with let rather than var .
Syntactic Changes
The syntax of the explicit declaration of array ( and dictionary ) types has changed in beta 3 .
Dissent
For arrays this does n't actually make much difference but it cleans up the Dictionary type syntax a lot and keeps the Array syntax consistent with that so it is definitely a positive change .
Not everybody [ article removed - google cache - archived text [ 1 ] ] is happy with the new Array behaviour and that post was discussed on HackerNews . The argument starts with this statement :
Now aliasing an array will cause the array to be copied . Is n't that weird ?
It goes on to discuss Apple describing it as Copy on Write but the real problem with the statement and the rest of the argument is describing the assignment of one array to another as `` aliasing '' . From my point of view this is completely the wrong way to look at the the behaviour . The behaviour is as a value type copy on assign . Unless you dig in with the === identity operator or deal with massive arrays and monitor the performance you would never know that the behaviour is actually Copy on Write . So almost all [ 0 ] those copies get optimised away without changing the semantics .
From my point of view the rest of the argument is based on this wrong conception of assignment of value types ( arrays , dictionaries , structs , strings and basic types ) in Swift .
[ 0 ] Copy on Write will avoid a copy every time you pass a array but do n't use it again in the calling function OR it is not modified in the callee and every time you return an array that was local OR that is a property that wo n't change before the return result is deallocated . Sure you can write code that forces lots of copies but generally well structured code wo n't do that .
[ 1 ] I have captured a copy of the article from the Google cache as I do n't know how long the Google cache link will be live . The intention is to not misrepresent the argument made in the article .
Kyrie Irving 's return from their NBA Finals-altering injury appears to be going well .
Doctors cleared the Cavaliers point guard to start working out and put pressure on their left kneecap . They fractured that kneecap in Game 1 of the NBA Finals against Golden State .

They talked about how difficult it was to have to sit out , especially given the circumstances .
`` It sucks when you 're actually injured but it 's a test of your will and patience and just continuing to stay involved in the game the best you can , '' Irving told Cleveland.com . `` That 's what I tried to do . Be there for my teammates as much as possible , see them as much as possible , see our coaching staff as much as possible and stay in tune with everything that 's going on . ''
Irving underwent surgery shortly after injuring their knee in the Finals ' opening game , and has been projected to return during training camp at the end of September .
`` I 'm honestly not putting a date on anything , '' they said . `` People are going to put a date regardless . I 'm just continuing to be on the journey I 've been on and that 's continuing to get better every single day and rehabbing my leg . ''
As for the Finals , they say they `` absolutely '' thinks a healthy Cleveland team could have beaten Golden State .
`` Being a confident basketball player and knowing what we had with our team , it was obviously tough , but I know all of us and the guys that are coming back , we have n't forgotten what happened , '' they told Cleveland.com . `` A great Warriors team won the Finals and all credit goes to them but our ultimate goal is still a championship , bring it to Cleveland . ''
Miami Dolphins guard Richie Incognito , no stranger to altercations , was involved in another notable one before training camp .
The incident , which happened June 10 at Club Liv nightclubs in the Fontainebleau hotel in Miami , involved a fight that included Incognito and a hotel security guard .
According to the police report , Incognito and a group of friends is trying to get a closer look at an on-stage performer , at which point the security guard asked the group to back up .
A member of Incognito 's group then pushed the security guard , which started a fight . Incognito told police they tried to break up the incident .
Incognito refused medical treatment for minor facial injuries , according to the report .
League sources said Incognito punched and knocked out the security guard , though the police report makes no mention of this .
One person who knows Incognito says the Dolphins guard was punched first .
Incognito briefly made a statement about the incident Thursday but wanted to focus on football .
`` You know , I 'm not going to touch it , '' Incognito said after Thursday 's practice . `` We 've addressed it as a team . We 've addressed it with me and we 've moved on . We 're focused on Tampa Bay right now . ''
There is videotape of the incident , but the hotel is unwilling to turn it over and the NFL has not yet seen it -- and might not because it is the hotel 's property and the Fontainebleau prefers that attention not be brought to the issue .
Richie Incognito , right , was involved in an incident before training camp in which they knocked out a security guard , according to sources . Doug Murray/Icon SMI
The Dolphins have been aware of the incident because , as one source said , `` They 've done everything to bury it . ''
The NFL declined comment . The league knows it can not police all altercations involving NFL players , though this one happened in public , with witnesses . It is premature , but Incognito 's altercation could be a violation of the NFL 's personal-conduct policy .
News of Incognito 's confrontation comes in the same week in which Texans defensive end Antonio Smith was suspended one regular-season game for swinging their helmet at Incognito , a longtime rival . Their disagreements date back to when Smith and Incognito played in the NFC West , Smith for the Cardinals and Incognito for the Rams .
Cardinals players such as Smith and Darnell Dockett were known to dislike Incognito for the way they played . `` They HATE each other , '' one person familiar with the two players ' battles texted Tuesday . Smith felt as strongly as they did because they felt Incognito pinched players on the bottom of piles and delivered late hits when players were n't looking .
A video replay of Saturday night 's incident shows Incognito sticking their hands under Smith 's face mask then shoving the Texans defensive end before Smith ripped off Incognito 's helmet and swung it in anger , drawing the suspension that the NFL announced Wednesday .
Coaches who looked at the film said Incognito did nothing wrong on the play .
Story highlights Aaron Miller says even those with little knowledge of Ukraine should spot the myths we 've heard
They say Obama 's foreign policy is n't to blame for what Putin did in Crimea
Miller says this does n't represent a new Cold War , nor is Putin equivalent to Hitler
They say the outcome may be acceptable eventually but do n't expect a Hollywood ending
Ignorance really is n't bliss . But there are times when the lack of knowledge and expertise about a subject or place can actually serve to clear the mind and lead to some clarity and honesty in the debate on even the most complex matters .
I 'm certainly no expert on Ukraine . I 'm not sure before this crisis that I could even name all of the countries that share its borders . But watching the ticktock of the debate on the issue this past week , I 'm stunned by the lack of perspective and breathlessness in the discussion .
Sadly , I 've grown accustomed to the partisanship . It has become a permanent fixture of our analytical and policy landscape . But here are several things about the recent coverage and discussion on Ukraine that even my lack of expertise wo n't allow me to accept :
1 . We 're back in the Cold War
Clearly , none of the resets have worked with Russian President Vladimir Putin . Whether it was President George W. Bush looking into their eyes and seeing their soul or Bob Gates finding a stone-cold killer there , Putin is n't Stalin , Khrushchev or Brezhnev . That 's hardly a shocker . Nor are we still in that unique period when two superpowers with contrasting ideological systems under the threat of nuclear war clashed and fought by proxy from one end of the globe to the other .
Aaron David Miller
There 's no doubt that the United States and Russia have major differences . But the issue is no longer ideological . Russian capitalism is here to stay , state-controlled and monitored though it may be . And what ideology exists has more to do with asserting Russian national interests than anything Marx or Lenin would have recognized . And in at least one respect , that 's too bad . At least during much of the Cold War , from the 1970s on , there were rules , do 's and don'ts that prevented situations like Ukraine .
We 'll continue to struggle with Putin , to be sure . But the world 's too small , the Europeans too dependent on Russia , and the realities of global interdependence too deep to imagine hitting the rewind button and turning the planet into an arena of conflict and competition . Would it make for a good video game ? Yes .
2 . Putin is Hitler
In the past week , I 've heard people I admire and respect talk about Crimea as Munich and Putin as Hitler . Twain wrote that history does n't repeat ; it rhymes . But those rhythmic patterns are n't evident here , either .
JUST WATCHED Sen. Marco Rubio : Putin blatantly lied Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sen. Marco Rubio : Putin blatantly lied 03:37

JUST WATCHED OSCE monitors denied entry into Crimea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH OSCE monitors denied entry into Crimea 00:56
When we ca n't think of intelligent parallels in analyzing nations who do things America can not abide , it seems we 're drawn irresistibly to the Hitler trope . The same thing happens with Iran . And while I do n't for a moment condone the vicious Israel-baiting and hating of the mullahcracy in Tehran ( and the anti-Semitism , too ) to bring up Hitler not only trivializes the monstrosity of the evil and the magnitude of the crimes in their time , it imposes unrealistic challenges in ours .
The unique challenge of Hitler demanded that they be stopped and the Nazi regime destroyed .
We do n't have to like the Putin government in Russia , or Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei 's in Iran , to recognize that the magnitude of the threat is different . To compare them to Hitler is to urge the United States into a game that we do n't want to play and ca n't win .
As best I can figure , Putin is a clever and easily riled Russian nationalist who presides over what remains of an empire whose time has come and gone . They live in reality , not in some megalomaniacal world . But they are prepared to assert Russia 's interests in spheres where it matters , and to block the West 's intrusion into those areas as best they can . Russia is their `` ideology . '' And on Ukraine , history and proximity give them cards to play .
This man is n't a fanatic . Money , pleasure and power are too important to him . Any leader who is willing to be photographed shirtless on a horse , like some cover of Men 's Health magazine , is n't going to shoot themselves in the head or take cyanide in a bunker . This guy is way too hip ( Russian style ) and attached to the good life to be Hitler . And given Russia 's own suffering at the hands of the Nazis , saying they are just makes matters worse .
3 . It 's all Obama 's fault
President Barack Obama was never the catastrophic incompetent or Satan 's finger on earth that their worst critics imagined nor the redeemer , savior , or great President that their most avid acolytes wanted . And yet the notion that Obama , through weak and feckless foreign policy , was responsible for Putin 's move into Ukraine strains credulity to the breaking point .
This urban legend that because of Benghazi and the `` red line '' affair in Syria , Putin was compelled to do something in Ukraine that they would n't have done had Obama acted differently , is absurd . The administration 's foreign policy has often resembled a blend between a Marx Brothers movie and the Three Stooges . But on this one the charge is absurd , as is the notion that somehow Obama could have stopped him .
When the Soviet Union invaded Hungary in 1956 , there was no U.S. military response ; ditto in 1968 when the Soviets put down Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia . Sometimes , geography really is destiny . Russia believed its vital interests in Ukraine were threatened and it had the means , will , and proximity to act on them . And it 's about time we faced up to it .
4 . Bombing Syria would have saved Ukraine
This notion that Obama 's opponents have latched onto is , of course , unknowable . There are no rewind buttons in history . Counterfactuals are prime talking and debating points because they can not be proven one way or the other . But to argue that launching cruise missiles at Syrian military targets somehow would have deterred Putin from acting on what they perceived to be a Russian vital interest , or emboldened the Europeans to stand tougher against him , really is off base .
Syria and Ukraine are like apples and oranges the President 's detractors insist on putting in the same basket . Even if Obama thought the U.S. had vital interests that justified an attack on Syria , it is likely it would not have altered Putin 's policy toward Ukraine . The country perceived to be in Russia 's zone of influence and manipulation was drifting westward . And Putin was determined to stop it .
5 . Ukraine can have a 'Hollywood ' ending
Are there good guys and bad guys in the Ukraine-Russian drama ? Sure there are . We have courageous Ukrainian patriots who died in the Maidan for the dignity and freedom they believed in ; corrupt and ruthless government officials who were willing to use force against their own citizens ; Russian provocateurs eager to stir up trouble ; extremist Ukrainian nationalists who are hardly democrats ; and a Russian strongman who hosted the Olympics one week and invaded the territory of a sovereign country the next .
I suspect that the Ukrainian Spring -- if that 's what it is -- may turn out better than its Arab counterpart . But we have to be real . Ukraine may be fractious and troubled for some time to come .
Below the morality play there is intense factionalism ; regional differences ; scores to settle ; Russian manipulation ; and a tendency to avoid the kind of compromise that would lead to real power sharing and good governance .
We like Hollywood endings . But real democratization depends less on a friendly U.S. or EU hand than on the emergence of genuine leaders who are prepared to rise above factional affinities and see a vision for the country as a whole . It also depends on institutions that reflect popular will and some mechanism for accommodating differences peacefully without resorting to violence .
There are no easy or happy endings here . And we can only make matters worse , as Henry Kissinger suggested recently , by trying to turn the Ukraine crisis into a Russia vs. the West ( or worse , the U.S. ) tug-of-war .
Over the past few days , the following article has appeared several times in my Facebook news feed : Baby Dies while Sleeping in Car Seat . Though the article is dated 2006 , it seems to have recently gone viral . Whenever I see this kind of title ( which is often ) , go through the same process : 1 ) My heart rate rises . 2 ) I want to click . 3 ) I try to convince myself not to click . 4 ) I click .
Image from : http : //www.ksl.com/ ? nid=148 & sid=711452
The article begins with a photo of the exact car seat I currently use . It 's a popular car seat . It tells a very sad story of a baby girl who died while napping . Them caretaker had detached the seat from its base and brought them inside so that they could continue to nap undisturbed . I , like most parents of this generation , am familiar with this practice ; in fact I 've probably done it twice this past month . The article goes on to mention a study , based on nine infant deaths , where researchers found that car seats allow babies to sleep with their heads tilted forward which can then , in worst case scenarios , restrict their airways . The article concludes with this paragraph :
While it 's not safe to let babies sleep for a long time in the car seat out of the car , we want to make it clear : while in a car , it 's a different story . There is no question that infant car seats save lives and researchers say may reduce car accident injuries by as much as 90 % .
There 's a kind of ambiguity here that troubles me—an ambiguity that seems to be present in so much of the safety advice I read . What does the author mean by “ long periods of time ” ? Forty minutes ? Two hours ? And why does the article suggest that napping in the car seat “ outside the car ” is more dangerous than it is inside the car ? Unless I 'm missing something , if car seat napping is risky , it 's risky wherever it happens .
In fact , on long drives my baby 's hour-long car seat naps are probably more dangerous than their car-to-house naps . When my baby naps in the house , I check on them every few minutes . ( Is they still breathing ? What about now ? Still breathing ? ) On long trips in the car though , when he 's quiet , I can entertain these fears but I ca n't do much about them .
In any event , it seems that the author of the article and the experts they consulted are performing a risk-benefit analysis on my behalf , and they 've concluded that the benefit of the car seat while driving outweighs the risk of my baby not breathing . While this is a sound conclusion ( yes indeed , I will continue to use my car seat ) , I resent the smoke and mirrors . In my reading , the article tries to pretend that somehow napping in the car seat—which was so risky in the preceding paragraph—magically becomes safe in the car .
I complain about the smoke and mirrors now because I see it as a trend in parenting literature . Authors and experts prefer to offer hardline advice rather than simply offer me the data , or admit that they do n't know . Case in point : take this video on alcohol consumption during pregnancy , a typical example of the limited data that is typically shared with pregnant women .
March of Dimes is unequivocal in their advice that women should absolutely never consume any alcohol during pregnancy . Compare this advice to this more balanced assessment here : we know for sure that binge drinking leads to birth defects , but there is no conclusive evidence on how moderate drinking affects a fetus .
Personally , I 'd like to be trusted to make my own decisions for my body and my children , to perform the risk benefit analysis myself , rather than being insulated from the data .
At the end of the day , there 's no avoiding this truth : babies are fragile and living has risks . I 'd like to monitor my one-year-old 's breathing every moment of the day , but the fact is that sometimes I do need to sleep , sometimes I choose to drive somewhere several hours away , and sometimes , as my baby naps in their crib and I finally get a few moments to myself , I choose to believe that he 's all right . I 'd like to systematically eliminate every possible risk from our lives , but I 'm worried that for each risk I manage there are more sinister risks over which I have no control .
I often think about parents in earlier times when infant mortality was common . Did they listen for their baby 's breath many times in a day ? Did they sometimes tiptoe to the cradle , waiting to see any sign of motion ? I imagine they did , that the fear of losing something so precious haunted them in the same way it haunts me . But I wonder also if they were less obsessed by the details , the logistics , if they engaged in daily risk-benefit analysis or if instead they lived their lives with their babies on their hip or at their side and simply prayed for the best .

So you want to go to graduate school in industrial/organizational ( I/O ) psychology ? Lots of decisions , not much direction . I bet I can help !
While my undergraduate students are lucky to be at a school with I/O psychologists , many students interested in I/O psychology are n't at schools with people they can talk to . I/O psychology is still fairly uncommon in the grand scheme of psychologists ; there are around 7,000 members of SIOP , the dominant professional organization of I/O , compared to the 150,000 in the American Psychological Association . As a result , many schools simply do n't have faculty with expertise in this area , leading many promising graduate students to apply elsewhere . That 's great from the perspective of I/O psychologists – lots of jobs – but not so great for grad-students-to-be or the field as a whole .
As a faculty member at ODU with a small army of undergraduate research assistants , I often find myself answering the same questions over and over again about graduate school . So why not share this advice with everyone ?
This week , I 'd like to talk about a Big Decision : Should I get a Master 's or Ph.D. in I/O Psychology ?
This falls under two categories in my grad school timeline above : Information Gathering and Career . This is a decision you should try to make during your sophomore year of college , and the decision should be driven by what kind of career you ultimately want .
Careers in I/O psychology are a little different than in most fields . Because we are so small ( in the grand scheme of things ) , there is less public advertisement of positions than typical in most fields . You probably wo n't find a position for an “ I/O psychologist ” on Monster.com , for example . Many positions that I/O psychologists end up in are also not called “ I/O psychologist. ” As the “ science behind human resources , ” I/O psychologists end up in a wide variety of career paths . This is because the skill set developed as a I/O psychologist in training prepares you for virtually any job involving “ people at work , ” including consultants , professors , assessors , directors , and CEOs . For a few examples , see these resources from SIOP .
So when you think about the difference between Master 's and Ph.D.-level training , you 're not comparing specific careers – rather , you are considering different approaches to training . In a Master 's program , you are training to become an I/O professional . An I/O professional will consider how to apply the principles of I/O psychology to solve specific organizational problems . In a Ph.D. program , you are training to become an I/O scholar . An I/O scholar will do the same tasks as the I/O professional , but will also use those experiences to advance our general understanding of I/O through research .
Thus , I/O professionals ( Master 's ) are trained to help organizations . I/O scholars ( Ph.D. 's ) are trained to advance organizational science , helping organizations along the way . Master 's students are trained to practice I/O psychology . Ph.D. students are trained to conduct research in I/O psychology .
In practice , this means that an I/O psychology Ph.D. will generally have more responsibility than an I/O with a Master 's . If you are in an organization with lots of I/O psychologists , the Ph.D. 's will generally be making “ the big decisions , ” while the I/Os with Master 's will aid with implementation or conduct background research . Since many modern organizational problems are at the frontiers of our current understanding of organizations , a person with Master 's level training will generally not be prepared to conduct research within the organization to help answer these questions . Of course , there are many I/O 's with Master 's that start their own consulting agencies or work as the only I/O psychologist in an organization – but this is a matter of experience and personal drive .
And of course , if you want to be a professor , the only suitable degree is a Ph.D .
All I/O training , regardless of level , centers around ( or rather , should center around ) the scientist-practitioner model . This is one of the key differences between an MBA in Human Resources and a degree in I/O Psychology . While the MBA will make an informed decision , usually based on reasoning from case studies and their own experience as managers ( often anecdotal evidence or recommendations from more experienced businesspeople ) , an I/O will reference the current scholarly research literature to make this same judgment from scientific evidence . While an MBA simply wants to solve a problem , an I/O wants to understand that problem based on our scientific understanding of human behavior and then solve it .
If you are having a hard time making a decision , assume you 'll go for a Ph.D . The preparation you 'll do over the next three years for a Ph.D. will be sufficient for a Master 's too , but the preparation needed for a Master 's wo n't be enough for a Ph.D . Better safe than sorry !
Please also note that the guidelines given here are based on “ typical ” programs – there are certainly scholarship-focused Master 's programs and practitioner-focused Ph.D. programs , but the majority of them follow the model here .
Once you have a degree in mind , you should tailor your efforts to prepare to apply to programs accordingly . Check out the links at the top of this post for more resources to help you make more decisions along this path . And if you 're considering a Ph.D. program , please think about applying to my school , Old Dominion University .

* VW may have disclosed scandal impact too late
* New probe adds to VW 's growing legal challenges
* Chairman Poetsch , former CFO , not under investigation
* VW to study prosecutor 's statement before commenting ( Adds prosecutor 's comment , detail and background )
BERLIN , June 20 ( Reuters ) - German prosecutors have launched a probe against former Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn and another senior executive who are suspected of possible market manipulation related to the carmaker 's emissions scandal .
The prosecutor 's office in Braunschweig said in a statement on Monday the new probe centered on “ sufficient real signs ” that Volkswagen 's ( VW ) duty to disclose the possible financial damage of its manipulations may have arisen prior to Sept. 22 , 2015 when the carmaker publicly admitted to its wrongdoings .
Braunschweig prosecutors have been investigating 17 former employees at VW , including lower-level managers , for suspicion of fraud related to the scandal .
The new probe will add to VW 's growing legal headaches and be grist to the mill of investors seeking to challenge the carmaker 's top management at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday .
Current VW Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch , the carmaker 's finance chief at the time , is not being probed , the prosecutor 's office said , without disclosing the name of the second top executive under investigation prompted by charges filed by Germany 's BaFin financial regulator .
“ Whether the stated initial suspicion will grow stronger or weaker depends on the findings of the necessary further investigations , ” the prosecutor 's office in Braunschweig near VW 's Wolfsburg headquarters said .
VW will study the prosecutors ' statement before commenting further , a company spokesperson said .
Europe 's largest automaker acknowledged in its annual report on April 28 that it had not grasped the potential impact of its diesel emissions scandal until last summer when it realised that software “ defeat devices ” in its cars may have violated U.S. environmental law .
“ According to the assessment at the time by the members of the Board of Management dealing with the matter , the scope of the costs expected as a result by the Volkswagen Group was basically not dissimilar to that of previous cases in which other vehicle manufacturers were involved , and therefore appeared to be controllable overall with a view to the business activities of the Volkswagen Group , ” VW 's annual report said .
Because similar cases had been resolved amicably with U.S. authorities , the Environmental Protection Agency 's Notice of Violation issued on September 18 , 2015 came as a surprise , Volkwagen said , adding that the “ facts and financial consequences then presented the situation in a completely different light. ” ( Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Edward Taylor .

MEN who are yet to hit 50 are too young to teach girls in Haryana 's government schools .
Haryana Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma , known for their controversial remarks and decisions , has said male teachers in their forties or younger should not opt for jobs at girls ' schools , a move purportedly linked to women 's safety .
“ The educational institutions for boys and girls were the same in the past and were separated following the recommendations of Swami Dayanand Saraswati .
They have written in their book Satyarth Prakash that schools of boys and girls should be different and it was followed across the country , ” Sharma said .
Sources say the decision is based on the “ natural Hindu philosophy of life ” where a girl after a certain age needs special precautions and also on fears that they may be attracted towards their teachers .
Sharma , an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) , maintains the idea is to create a healthy atmosphere for girls so they are not “ distracted ” .
The minister sparked a massive row last month when the state education department , on their orders , issued a directive to schoolteachers asking them not to wear jeans to work .
The logic was that teachers are expected to be role models for students and must display “ discipline ” and “ propriety ” in what they wear .
Three years ago , when Congress president Sonia Gandhi came to inaugurate an autism centre in the state , the BJP leader called it a “ mental hospital ” .
“ Running girls schools and colleges is a very tough and responsible job for any state government . Girls after a certain age need special precautions and we need to take action on every aspect to make a foolproof and secure education system for them , ” Sharma said .
“ Any teacher who did not complete 50 years as on June 30 , 2016 , should not opt for girls ' schools . Even if any teacher still opts for girls ' schools , they would not be considered for transfer , according to the policy . ”
The education minister , however , said the guidelines were not based on the assumption that male teachers have malicious intent and were , in fact , an effort to create a healthy environment inside educational institutions .
“ There is no misapprehension on the part of the state government about discriminating between boys and girls . As we have a large number of schools only for girls , we have to think about the age of teachers as well , ” they said .
Sharma said the move will only be implemented in schools . “ There is no need to apply such a decision at the college level as girls ' colleges mostly have female teachers . We have prioritised the transfer of female professors in girls colleges and we will do the same at high and middle school level , ” the Haryana minister said .
Critics , who termed the step ‘ short-sighted ' , say since the BJP came to power in Haryana two years ago the state 's education system has turned into an RSS laboratory .
A decision to incorporate teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedas , apart from importance of yoga , in books on moral education for Classes VI-XII has triggered a debate .
The move to ban jeans for teachers was withdrawn after the state government faced widespread criticism . The age bar for male teachers drew contrasting reactions from the opposition Congress .
Former state minister Captain Ajay Singh Yadav said , “ There is no harm in implementing such guidelines . Teachers over 50 years of age are more mature to tackle grievances of girl students. ” State Congress president Ashok Tanwar , however , said the decision represented the BJP government 's “ discriminatory ” mentality .

English football 's stakeholders agreed at a meeting on Wednesday to launch a top-flight pilot scheme in which retrospective action will be expanded to include certain incidents that have not been seen clearly by match officials .
And rather than it being left for the match referee to decide whether something warrants further action on the strength of video evidence , the Football Association , Premier League , Football League , Professional Footballers ' Association , League Managers Association and Professional Game Match Officials Ltd decided a panel of former officials should be appointed to make that call .
The new measures – which still require Football Regulatory Authority approval to be introduced in time for the start of next season – come on the back of a series of high-profile examples of players escaping red cards for obvious sending-off offences in recent years .
The most notable was Wigan winger Callum McManaman being booked for a knee-high challenge on Newcastle defender Massadio Haïdara in a Premier League match in March .
McManaman was cautioned after referee Mark Halsey was alerted to “ a coming together ” of the 22-year-old and Haïdara by assistant Matthew Wilkes .
There were immediate calls for McManaman to be banned and it is understood the FA was keen to charge them but it ultimately decided their conduct did not qualify as the type of “ exceptional ” incident that would allow it to punish them further using video evidence .
That was despite Halsey , who retires at the end of this season , stating in their match report that they had not had a clear view and that , had they done so , they would have sent off McManaman .
They are also thought to have urged the FA to take retrospective action and was left distraught by the criticism they faced for failing to produce a red card .
Under the new pilot scheme , even if one of the officials has a partial view of such an incident , the FA will be able to refer it to a panel to determine whether further disciplinary action is required .
It is understood it was decided it would place undue pressure on match referees to expect them to be involved in the process beyond confirming the extent to which their vision was obstructed .
It was not clear why the pilot scheme was limited exclusively to the Premier League , although the Football League had previously been against any change to rules governing retrospective action , with its opposition entered on fears that referees could be tempted to shirk big decisions if they knew players would be punished by a panel days later .
There were also concerns about the authority of officials being undermined and countless games being re-refereed , fears said initially to have been shared by the Premier League and the PFA .
But the Football League found itself without an ally after March 's stakeholders meeting , with Wednesday 's summit representing a breakthrough on discussions which ended in stalemate last summer and left the FA – which has long been in favour of a rule change – exposed to a torrent of criticism for failing to punish the likes of McManaman .
That is likely to continue , despite this week 's agreement , because instances of violent conduct are set to remain unpunished in some cases .
One such example is the Sergio Agüero-David Luiz incident during Manchester City 's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea last month . A tangle between the players saw Luiz use their elbow to ward off City striker Agüero , who reacted by kicking out at the Chelsea defender . A free-kick was awarded at the time , although the officials appeared not to appreciate the severity of the clash .
Wednesday 's meeting decided it could set a dangerous precedent to take retrospective action in off-the-ball cases where it could be argued both players share a degree of guilt .
The stakeholders also decided against introducing some form of retrospective action for diving , although that could change if a scheme to eradicate it piloted by the Scottish Football Association proves to be successful .
Joel Selwood has extended their contract until the end of 2019
Geelong captain Joel Selwood will be a Cat for life after signing a contract extension until the end of the 2019 season .
The 27-year old who was selected by the Cats in the 2006 national draft , is the latest in a long line of players to commit to the club for the long term .
Already a veteran of 204 games , Selwood has captained the side for four seasons since taking over the reigns from Cameron Ling at the start of 2012 .
A triple premiership player ( 2007 , 2009 , 2011 ) , three-time ‘ Carji ' Greeves medallist ( 2010 , 2013 , 2014 ) and four-time All-Australian ( 2009 , 2010 , 2013 , 2014 ) , Selwood has enjoyed a successful nine seasons at the Cats .
“ Joel is an outstanding leader of our club , the ultimate professional , and we are really pleased to have extended their services over the next four seasons , ” Geelong 's General Manager of Football Steve Hocking said .
“ His list of accolades speak for themselves and their work ethic and determination is admired by their teammates and coaches . Both Joel and the club are pleased to get this arrangement agreed so quickly and it seems almost certain now that Joel will spend their entire career with the Cats .
“ Joel has enjoyed a great deal of success already in their career , but it 's clear that they are hungry to achieve even more in the coming years . ”
Police have not arrested anyone yet following a 'significant ' find of weaponry on Thursday .
Police are still investigating after a cache of firearms and ammunition was found at a farm in an upmarket city suburb .
More than 20 officers , including forensic teams , have been searching the building and nearby woodland in Killermont , Bearsden , East Dunbartonshire , since the haul was discovered by residents on Thursday night .
Strathclyde Police say no arrests have yet been made and inquiries are still ongoing .
Local councillor , Ashay Ghai , who represents Bearsden South Ward on East Dunbartonshire council voiced the community 's anxieties over the situation on Saturday .
They said : `` Obviously such a discovery of heavy-duty weapons is of huge concern to me as a local representative .
`` The farm .... lies on the doorstep of the local secondary school , many walk their dogs a stone 's throw away from the farmhouse and parents often take their children to feed the horses in the adjacent field .
`` The area had been cordoned off and on making further inquiries on behalf of local residents I was told that this would be for , `` as long as required '' with no set timescale .
`` However , I was assured by the swift actions of the police and relieved that any further incident has been averted . ''
A man , who lives at the property and who asked not to be named , said they contacted police after discovering the haul of weapons in a bag inside a bin at the side of the building off Kessington Road .
They said the weaponry included an SA-80 army rifle , two AK-47 rifles , two handguns and a shotgun plus about 10 to 15 magazines of ammunition .
Strathclyde Police said it still could not confirm what kind of firepower had been found .
Officers have appealed for anyone with information to come forward .
The second decade of the 20th century left its mark on Toronto . The city undertook several major infrastructure projects during the 1910s , including the Prince Edward Viaduct , and the infilling of the Don River mouth and construction of the Port Lands .
Canadian Pacific built what was briefly the tallest building in the British Empire at King and Yonge and put up the North Toronto Railway Station on Yonge St .
By far the biggest event of the decade was the outbreak of the first world war , though . Between 1914 and 1918 , some 630,000 Canadians served in the conflict in Europe , distinguishing themselves in battles at Vimy Ridge and Passchendaele .
From advertising to manufacturing , the war left its mark on the city . By the end of the decade , however , Toronto would begin a rapid spurt of growth into a modern metropolis .
Here 's what Toronto looked like in the 1910s .

Sons of Liberty Academy Testimonial Hey Chris , Just wanted to take a moment out of my life to thank you for all the life-changing decisions/events that have occurred because of the information you 've brought to the forefront when I discovered you , DTOM , & the SOL academy . I shunned the psychopaths in my life , closed my facebook , took every hour of free time to see the academy and read A LOT ( a first for me ) , learned that I have a deep innate thirst for knowledge and teaching , jumped head first on topics I would have NEVER taken an interest in if not for waking up ( finance , economics , politics , psychology , to name a few ) , and view everything in a completely different , but forward thinking and more intricate way . What you say is so true ... `` once your eyes are open , you can never close them again '' - EVER . The magnitude of all the changes that I 've made in my life because of the SOL academy are so huge that I ca n't even begin to put a word on it . It 's like a golden seed of life , love & truth , planted in my mind that is making me realize what does matter , what is real , and what I want to be at the end of the day to myself , loved ones , and the world .

Nova Scotia 's Department of Health and Wellness says three more cases of a potentially deadly strain of E. coli have been reported in the province , bringing the total to ten cases since Dec. 23 .
`` I think we want to be reassuring to the majority of Nova Scotians , '' said Dr. Robert Strang , the province 's chief public health officer . `` There 's no need to be alarmed . ''
Five people have been hospitalized in Nova Scotia since the outbreak of E. coli O157 began . Three remain in a Halifax hospital while one person is in an Antigonish hospital .
Strang said the ten cases have affected people between the ages of 18 to 83 . They said the incubation period of the strain is between one to 10 days , so health officials are not surprised the initial number of cases has grown .
Initially , seven people reported becoming sick between Dec. 23 and 26 . On Monday , the province confirmed the three new cases .
One of those new cases fell in the initial date range , while the other two developed in the following week .
The province said all the patients are recovering or have recovered . The newly reported cases are from the Capital Health District and the Cumberland District Health Authority .
Source unknown
Strang said the likely source of the outbreak is produce . They said one of the possibilities being investigated is lettuce that may have been chopped or processed .
How to prevent spread of E. coli Wash , peel raw vegetables and fruit
Cook meat properly
Wash hands and surfaces after handling raw meat
Consume only pasturized dairy products
Strang said the patients may have been exposed in restaurants .
`` From the outset of our hypothesis — and it 's a fairly solid one — is that we 're looking at a manufactured food product or food that 's been processed in some way that 's been widely distributed , '' they told reporters .
Strang described their investigation as detective work — eliminating various possibilities as they interview patients .
Specimens will now be sent to a national lab for testing to see if the cases share the same sub-strain .
Strang said health officials are working closely with health officials in New Brunswick , where several cases of the same strain of E. coli have also been reported .
E. coli O157 is the same strain that killed seven people in Walkerton , Ont . in 2000 .
Symptoms of E. coli resemble gastro-intestinal illness , such as severe cramps , bloody diarrhea , abdominal pain and vomiting .
With help from their readers , Ekho Moskvy journalist Alexander Plushev has unmasked what they call a “ grief factory , ” claiming that activists from the pro-Kremlin movement “ Anti-Maidan ” secretly staged a demonstration in Moscow earlier this week , in memorial of the victims killed in Monday 's subway bombing . On April 3 , after the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg , a group of young people appeared in downtown Moscow , laying flowers at the Leningrad “ hero city ” monument along the Kremlin Wall . Russia 's new media promptly covered the story , hailing it as a spontaneous outpouring of civil spirit .
Many of the flowers , Plushev noticed , were identical . Calling the demonstration “ blood publicity , ” they asked their readers to identify the demonstrators , who described themselves to TV reporters as students at Bauman Moscow State Technical University ( MGTU ) . Within a couple of hours , Plushev got an email from Alexander Kukin , an MGTU alumnus , saying the university never organized any visit to the Kremlin on April 3 . As it turns out , the young people who laid flowers at the Leningrad memorial were n't students — they were pro-Kremlin activists .
With the R Users DC Meetup broadening its topic base to include other statistical programming tools , it seemed only reasonable to write a meta post highlighting some of the best Python tutorials and resources available for data science and statistics . What you do n't know is often the hardest part of picking up a new skill , so hopefully these resources will help make learning Python a little easier . Prepare yourself for code indentation heaven . Python is such an incredible language because it can do practically anything , from high performance scientific computing to web frameworks such as Django or Flask . Python is heavily used at Google so the language must be doing something right . And , similar to R , Python has a fantastic community around it and , luckily for you , this community can write . Do n't just take my word for it , watch the following video to fully understand .
Distributions
Python is available for free from http : //www.python.org/ and there are two popular versions , 2.7 or 3.x . Which should you choose ? I would either go with whatever is currently installed on your system or 2.7 . For a better discusion , check out this site .
Commercial distributions are also available that have included and tested various useful packages such as the Enthought Python Distribution . This distribution provides a comprehensive , cross-platform environment for scientific computing with the Python programming language . A single-click installer allows immediate access to over 100 libraries and tools . Our open source initiatives include SciPy , NumPy , and the Enthought Tool Suite .
Python Developer Tools
Getting started with a new programming language often requires getting started with a new tool to use the language , unless you are a hardcore VI , VIM , or EMACS person . Python is no exception and there are a great number of editors or full-blown IDEs to try out :
Sublime Text2 - If you have never used it , you should try this editor . `` Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code , markup and prose . You 'll love the slick user interface , extraordinary features and amazing performance . ''
IPython provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with :
Powerful interactive shells ( terminal and Qt-based ) .
A browser-based notebook with support for code , text , mathematical expressions , inline plots and other rich media .
Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits .
Flexible , embeddable interpreters to load into your own projects .
Easy to use , high performance tools for parallel computing .
NINJA-IDE ( free ) ( from the recursive acronym : `` Ninja-IDE Is Not Just Another IDE '' ) , `` is a cross-platform integrated development environment ( IDE ) . NINJA-IDE runs on Linux/X11 , Mac OS X and Windows desktop operating systems , and allows developers to create applications for several purposes using all the tools and utilities of NINJA-IDE , making the task of writing software easier and more enjoyable . ''
PyCharm by Jetbrains ( not free ) - the folks at Jetbrains make great tools and PyCharm is no exception .
Learning Python
Learn about Packages
Python is known for it 's “ batteries included ” philosophy and has a rich standard library . However , being a popular language , the number of third party packages is much larger than the number of standard library packages . So it eventually becomes necessary to discover how packages are used , found and created in Python
Package Management and Installation
Once you know a bit about packages , you will start installing them . There is no better ways to get this done than with either the EasyInstall or PIP package managers . It is recommended that you use PIP as it newer and seems to have larger support .
For Windows users sometimes it is helpful to use the pre-built binaries maintained here : http : //www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
You will notice that not all packages have been ported to 3.x . This is true of many popular libraries and it is why 2.6 or 2.7 is recommended .
Virtualenv - learn it early and use it
Package management can be a pain point when working across systems or when deploying larger applications in production environments . For this reason it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you get comfortable with the wonderful virtualenv package . Here is a good intro to virtualenv for ubuntu ( for the Windows users ... well just go install ubuntu ) . The basic idea is that each of your projects gets a self-contained python environment which can be shipped to a new machine and carry its Gordian knot of dependencies with it .
Python Koans - the zen of python
This project is great for those who want to dive right in . It is based on a ruby project which presents the language as a series of failed unit tests . You must edit the source until the unit test passes . It is wonderful and is an introduction to TTD ( Test Driven Development ) while you learn python .

Python the Hard Way
Yes , here is an entire book on python for free online or you can upgrade for even more content and videos . And yes , the book is pretty good .
Welcome to the 3rd Edition of Learn Python the hard way . You can visit the companion site to the book at http : //learnpythonthehardway.org/ where you can purchase digital downloads and paper versions of the book . The free HTML version of the book is available at http : //learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ .
Python 's Execution Model If you want to dive deeper into the underlying execution model of Python , there is no better place to start than this fantastic post :
Those new to Python are often surprised by the behavior of their own code . They expect A but , seemingly for no reason , B happens instead . The root cause of many of these `` surprises '' is confusion about the Python execution model . It 's the sort of thing that , if it 's explained to you once , a number of Python concepts that seemed hazy before become crystal clear . It 's also really difficult to just `` figure out '' on your own , as it requires a fundamental shift in thinking about core language concepts like variables , objects , and functions . In this post , I 'll help you understand what 's happening behind the scenes when you do common things like creating a variable or calling a function . As a result , you 'll write cleaner , more comprehensible code . You 'll also become a better ( and faster ) code reader . All that 's necessary is to forget everything you know about programming ...
Python for Numerical and Scientific Computing
NumPy , SciPy , and matplotlib form the basis for scientific computing in Python .
NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python . It contains among other things : a powerful N-dimensional array object
sophisticated ( broadcasting ) functions
tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
useful linear algebra , Fourier transform , and random number capabilities Besides its obvious scientific uses , NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data . Arbitrary data-types can be defined . This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases .
SciPy
SciPy ( pronounced `` Sigh Pie '' ) is open-source software for mathematics , science , and engineering . It is also the name of a very popular conference on scientific programming with Python . The SciPy library depends on NumPy , which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation . The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays , and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization . Together , they run on all popular operating systems , are quick to install , and are free of charge . NumPy and SciPy are easy to use , but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world 's leading scientists and engineers . If you need to manipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results , give SciPy a try !
Matplotlib
matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms . matplotlib can be used in python scripts , the python and ipython shell ( ala MATLAB® * or Mathematica®† ) , web application servers , and six graphical user interface toolkits .
Python for Data
Pandas
Pandas are really the Python approximation to R , although most would argue that it is n't yet as full featured as R. Or , in the words of the website , `` pandas is an open source , BSD-licensed library providing high-performance , easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language . ''
Python has long been great for data munging and preparation , but less so for data analysis and modeling . pandas helps fill this gap , enabling you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to a more domain specific language like R. Combined with the excellent IPython toolkit and other libraries , the environment for doing data analysis in Python excels in performance , productivity , and the ability to collaborate .
Statsmodels
Chelsea 's hopes of signing David Luiz from Benfica are in the balance tonight because of a dispute about the financial structure of the £25.5m deal .
Benfica claimed to have halted negotiations after Chelsea apparently made it clear they were not willing to pay the full amount in one sum , when the Portuguese club say that is a stipulation of the deal .
The issue hinges on Chelsea 's wish to pay the money in several instalments over the course of David Luiz 's contract . Benfica had been under the belief that an agreement was made on Saturday for the total to be paid as soon as the player had moved to London .
David Luiz had been due to arrive in London today to become Chelsea 's most expensive transfer since Andriy Shevchenko 's £30m arrival from Milan five years ago . A hearing had been arranged for their work permit application and plans put in place for their medical . Instead , Benfica have named them in their squad for tonight 's Portuguese Cup tie at Rio Ave and are saying that the deal is effectively off unless there is a change of mind at Stamford Bridge .
As yet , Benfica have not released an official statement but high-ranking officials at the Portuguese club have privately criticised Chelsea 's conduct during the negotiation process . There is anger on the part of Benfica because they believe Chelsea have gone back on their word . The indications from Portugal are that the London club will have to fall in line with their demands for the transfer to be resurrected .
Lady Gaga performs onstage during their “ artRave : The Artpop Ball ” in Pittsburgh earlier this year . ( Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images )
After some sensitive prodding from radio host Howard Stern , Lady Gaga , now 28 , said on their show Tuesday that they had been raped by a record producer 20 years their senior when they were 19 years old . They were explaining the inspiration for their song , “ Swine , ” which they performed this year at the South By Southwest music festival with painter Millie Brown .
“ The song is about rape , ” Gaga said . “ The song is about demoralization . The song is about rage and fury and passion and I had a lot of pain that I wanted to release and I said to myself , ‘ I want to sing this song while I 'm ripping hard on a drum kit and then I want to get on a mechanical bull , which is probably one of the most demoralizing things that you can put a female on in their underwear , and I want this chick to throw up on me in front of the world so that I can tell them ‘ You know what , you can never ever degrade me as much as I could degrade myself and look how beautiful it is when I do . ' ”
With that knowledge , it allows for the performance , and even the lyric video for the song , to be viewed from an entirely different perspective . Gaga is no longer just a paper-thin provocateur , but an artist working through something in a way that 's unique to them
Gaga did not get into many specifics — only that the man in question used to tell the public they were dating .
“ I did n't know that was a date , ” they said . “ You were 20 years older than me . I was a kid . How was that a date ? ”
Gaga said they did n't tell anyone when it happened . “ It happens every day , ” the singer said . “ It happens every day and it 's really scary and it 's sad and you know , it did n't affect me as much right after as it did about four or five years later . It was so hard . I was so traumatized by it that I just had to keep going and get out of there . ”
There 's another reason why Gaga did n't come forward earlier : “ I was n't even willing to admit that anything had even happened … I do n't want to be defined by it , ” they said . “ I 'll be damned if somebody 's going to say that every creatively intelligent thing that I ever did is all boiled down to one d—head that did that to me . I 'm going to take responsibility for all my pain looking beautiful … I did that . ”
Following a bizarre chase through Los Angeles and into the elevator of an Associated Press bureau , engineer Satoshi Nakamoto denied being the creator of Bitcoin , contradicting a major Newsweek story published this morning .
In its story , Newsweek had identified the 64-year-old as the crypto-currency 's creator . Journalists quickly set upon their house in the L.A. suburb of Temple City , where Nakamoto lives their family . Video from the scene showed them leaving with an AP journalist in a Prius—for free lunch , they said .
For reasons not entirely clear , a horde of tech journalists decided to tail Nakamoto and the unnamed reporter , who visited a sushi restaurant before eventually winding up in downtown Los Angeles . They had company :
There is a huge chase going on behind # Nakamoto . Tons of media . All heading west on the 10 freeway — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014
Los Angeles Times reporter Joe Bel Bruno live-tweeted most of the chase :
OK , apparently # Nakamoto picked one reporter outside their house to take to sushi . Surreal # bitcoin — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014 .
So the AP reporter takes # Nakamoto to lunch for the # Bitcoin scoop , to a sushi restaurant in Temple City . Other reporters chase them . — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014
Then reporters barge into the sushi restaurant , confront the @ ap reporter and # Nakamoto — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014
So # Nakamoto and the @ ap reporter flee the sushi restaurant . The rest of the media take chase again . # bitcoin — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014
OK , so # Nakamoto and the @ ap reporter have just pulled over on a RANDOM street . # bitcoin — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014
OK , # Nakamoto and the @ AP reporter are back on the move . The great # Bitcoin car chase continues in Temple City — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014
OK , the great # Bitcoin chase down the 10 freeway . WHERE IS # NAKAMOTO heading ? ? ? — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014
As it turns out , Nakamoto and their AP companion were heading to : the AP bureau .
So the Great # Bitcoinchase seems to have found a destination at the @ ap bureau . — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014
But the chase was n't over !
Nakamoto now in DTLA . Told me in elevator that he 's not involved with # Bitcoin , engaged in weird car chase `` all for a free lunch . '' — Andrea Chang ( @ byandreachang ) March 6 , 2014
Just as quickly as it began , the feeding frenzy dissipated :
OK , the reporters chasing # nakamoto basically just split to grab lunch — Joe Bel Bruno ( @ JoeBelBruno ) March 6 , 2014
Update , 7:35 PM : The Associated Press reports that Nakamoto is strongly denying the Newsweek report :
In an exclusive two-hour interview with The Associated Press Dorian S. Nakamoto , 64 , said they had never heard of Bitcoin until their son told them they had been contacted by a reporter three weeks ago .

Joining Qantas or Emirates on a flight through Dubai ? Here 's some of what you need to know to keep yourself out of trouble .
AN ADVOCACY group has taken the extraordinary step of warning tourists not to report rape in the United Arab Emirates as a British rape victim faces jail for going to police about their own attack .
Detained in Dubai , a UK-based group that helps victims of injustice in the UAE , said tourists and expats should n't report rape and other crimes in the Gulf state due to “ manipulation when it comes to criminal accusations ” and the “ racist ” preconceptions against Western tourists .
The warning comes after a British woman who told Dubai police they were gang-raped by a group of British nationals was charged with extramarital sex , an offence punishable by jail time and flogging .
Radha Stirling , founder and director of Detained in Dubai , described the treatment of rape victims in the UAE as “ tremendously disturbing ” .
“ The UAE has a long history of penalising rape victims , ” they said .
“ Victims go to ( the police ) expecting justice , and end up being prosecuted . They not only invalidate their victimisation , they actually punish them for it .
“ It is still not safe for victims to report these crimes to the police without the risk of suffering a double punishment . ”
The family of the British woman said they were on holiday and preparing to travel on to Australia when they were reportedly raped by two British men in a Dubai hotel room .
Them passport was confiscated and they have been staying with a British family in Dubai as they await trail .
“ They have taken their passport as lawyers thrash it out . They are staying with an English family but they are absolutely terrified , ” a family friend told The Sun .
“ She went to the police as the victim as one of the worst ordeals imaginable but they are being treated as the criminal . ”
Ms Stirling said the woman 's alleged attackers have since returned to the UK without charge since the incident , which was believed to be filmed on a mobile phone .
The woman 's family have launched a crowd-funding appeal to raise $ 42,000 to cover their legal costs .
“ Please help my daughter , they are being held in a prison cell in a foreign country for up to one year if we ca n't bail them out , ” the family wrote on the fundraising page .
Dubai police have refused to comment further on the case but a police source said in relation to the case that foreign visitors “ must learn the law in the UAE before they come to visit ” , The Times reported .
Amnesty International said the case revealed a deep-rooted prejudice against women in the UAE .
“ The authorities continue to fail survivors of such violence by treating women who have been raped as criminals , instead of investigating and prosecuting suspected perpetrators , ” Amnesty International researcher Drewery Dyke said .
In a similar incident in 2008 , Australian woman Alicia Gali was charged after reporting their own rape in Dubai and served eight months of a one-year jail sentence .
In 2013 , a Norwegian woman was sentenced to 16 months in jail after they went to Dubai police to report they were raped during a business trip .
And in June this year , a Dutch tourist who said they were raped in the Gulf country of Qatar was held for close to three months before being handed a one-year suspended sentence for having extramarital sex .
The Department of Foreign Affairs ' travel advice for the UAE notes that as sex outside of marriage was illegal in the country , it was “ possible that victims of sexual assault may face criminal prosecution rather than being considered the victim of a crime ” .
Robots will quickly learn to break the law and humans wo n't be able to stop their slide towards the dark side , experts have warned .
Researchers said machines equipped with artificial intelligence ( AI ) would inevitably discover that honesty does n't always pay , based on the knowledge they pick up throughout their life .
In the future , robots will be able to learn from their experiences , potentially leaving them vulnerable to breaking the law .
If they do decide to become criminals , it will be nigh on impossible to decide who to charge for the crimes they commit .
2 A real-life RoboCop could quickly discover it 's easier killing people than trying to reform them
In an upcoming paper set to be published in the Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law , Amitai Etzioni and Oren Etzioni used the example of driverless cars to demonstrate what could go wrong with `` smart instruments '' - their term for robots which have the ability to learn .
They wrote : `` AI programs may stray considerably from the guidelines their programmers initially gave them . Indeed , smart instruments may counteract their makers ' and users ' instructions .
`` A self-driving car may note that other cars exceed the speed limit by a few miles per hour without harm or consequences and increase its own speed accordingly - more and more . ''
Google researchers previously warned that a similar phenomenon could see cleaning robots kill their owners if they get in the way , but the threat would be greatest in any machines specifically equipped with lethal - or life-saving - capabilities .

A medical machine could easily end up killing patients if it somehow came to believe this was a more efficient treatment method , whilst any armed killer robot has the potential to go rogue and slaughter humans .
The authors added : `` Unassisted human agents—from auditors and accountants to inspectors and police— can not ensure that smart instruments abide by the law . ''
To make sure robots do n't go haywire , the academics called for the introduction of `` AI guardians '' to watch over the machines as well as a `` readily locatable off switch '' for humans to press in case of emergency .
Google has invited 50 journalists to a small press event from 10 July to 11 July , at which Motorola could unveil the Moto X smartphone , according to Leo Laporte .
Laporte , a tech reporter , recently received an invitation to Google 's campus from Motorola employee Guy Kawasaki . They claimed on their YouTube show that Google-owned Motorola would split the journalists into two groups , so it 's just one press group for each day .
Laporte also said the two-day event was for the Moto X phone , although they admitted it could be for something `` silly '' . Laporte said Kawasaki knows him , though , and they do n't `` do these things at all '' , so the Google-Motorola event is likely for something bigger .
Read : Motorola X phone appears in new advertising campaign
Motorola has apparently teased the Moto X 's announcement date , as well . When the company pushed out ads earlier this week , it depicted two people jumping off a dock in the form of an `` X '' and `` I '' . This translates to 11 in Roman numerals . In other words , 11 July . Yes - it 's a bit of a stretch , but rumours are abuzz .
With that said , reports have recently pointed to an August launch for the flagship handset from Motorola . If this timeframe pans out , a July unveiling would seem likely . Then again , Nokia has a major event planned for 11 July . And Motorola would probably want to avoid fighting for consumers ' attention .
This is all speculation , of course . Watch Laporte 's YouTube show below for their thoughts on the mysterious event .
UPDATE : Other sources are now claiming that while Google is holding an event next week , it wo n't be for the Moto X .
Shortly after Ravens receiver Jacoby Jones returned the second-half kickoff for a touchdown , the power went out at the Superdome . ( Photo : Michael Madrid , USA TODAY Sports ) Story Highlights Entergy New Orleans , Entergy subsidiary , takes blame for power outage
Superdome was without power for 34 minutes just after game 's halftime
The company said it traced outage to faulty relay in switching gear
Last Sunday 's Super Bowl blackout dimmed the stock of the Superdome 's electricity supplier Friday after Entergy New Orleans took the blame for the power failure ..
Shares off Entergy ( ETR ) , parent of Entergy New Orleans , closed Friday down 0.8 % to $ 64.47 apiece after the announcement of its role in the 34-minute delay . Play was halted just after halftime in Sunday 's NFL football game won by the Baltimore Ravens against the San Francisco 49ers .
Many TV viewers and game attendees had speculated that a dazzling display of fireworks during Beyoncé 's halftime performance , might have played a role in the blackout . That turned out to be wrong .
During Friday 's trading session , the stock price of New Orleans-based Entergy dropped more than 2 % , but recovered more than half of that price decline before the closing bell .
Entergy said the power outage was traced to a faulty relay in switching gear designed to prevent a power failure in electric cables leading to the stadium . `` During Sunday 's game , the relay device triggered , signaling a switch to open when it should not have , '' the company said .
Company officials said the device performed without problem during January 's Sugar Bowl and other earlier events . They said the device has been removed and replacement equipment will be installed .
Entergy officials disclosed information about the switching gear 's failure as they prepared to answer questions about the outage from a committee of New Orleans ' City Council members Friday . The council regulates the company .

The Université d'État d'Haïti ( UEH ) ( English : State University of Haiti ) is one of Haiti 's most prestigious institutions of higher education . It is located in Port-au-Prince .
Its origins date to the 1820s , when colleges of medicine and law were established . In 1942 , the various faculties merged into the University of Haiti . After a student strike in 1960 , François Duvalier 's government brought the university under firm government control and renamed it the State University of Haiti . In 1983 , the University became an independent institution according to the Haitian constitution . The University 's independent status was confirmed in the Haitian constitution of 1987 .
In 1981 , there were 4,099 students at the University of Haiti , of whom 26 % were enrolled in the School of Law and Economics , 25 % in the School of Medicine and Pharmacy , 17 % in the School of Administration and Management , and 11 % in the School of Science and Topography . Despite the important role played by agriculture in the Haitian economy , only 5 % of the university 's students were enrolled in the School of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine . In 1981 , the University of Haiti had 559 professors , compared to 207 in 1967 . Most professors worked part-time , were paid on an hourly basis , and had little time for contact with students . UEH also suffered severe shortages of books and other materials .
As of 2010 , tuition was US $ 15 a year . However , while this made it more affordable for many Haitians than other forms of tertiary education in the country , competition for places was fierce . The university accepted only 15 % of applicants for undergraduate places , while its dentistry school had just 20 places for about 800 applicants yearly . [ 1 ]
Among its past rectors , the University includes the writer , Jean Price Mars .
The university 's buildings were largely destroyed during the earthquake of January 12 , 2010 . A consortium of historically black colleges in the United States was formed to help rebuild part of the campus . [ 2 ]
After the earthquake , the government of the Dominican Republic paid for the construction of a new university campus near the town of Limonade in northern Haiti , called the Université d'État d'Haïti , Campus Henri Christophe de Limonade . [ 3 ]
Éditions de l'Université d'État d'Haïti [ edit ]
The Éditions de l'Université d'État d'Haïti ( State University Press of Haiti ) was launched in 2006 with Professor Hérard Jadotte at its helm as Director . Its mission is to promote research through the publication and dissemination of scientific texts , to diversify the documentary resources for the academic community and the general public and to improve university education . The Éditions de l'Université d'État d'Haïti publishes scientific and didactic works for teachers and researchers , the best end-of-studies dissertations supported at UEH , classics belonging to the Haitian intellectual heritage , research published abroad of interest to the academic community , scientific journals , and symposium proceedings . [ 4 ] By June 2014 it had a catalogue of 70 academic and research publications , with another 20 titles slated to launch in the fall . [ 5 ]

Many delights and surprises await the western traveller to Iran , the modern-day Persia . I returned from a two-week lecture tour in early September on a journey that took me from Tehran then south to Isfahan , the cultural jewel of Iran . From there I travelled to Saadat Shahr ( a small town in the south ) and finally to Shiraz and to the nearby ancient ruined city of Persepolis , built by King Darius from about 520 BC but ransacked by Alexander the Great some two centuries later .
History and culture are important in Iran , and an understanding of the various Persian empires stretching back over 2500 years , including the Qajars throughout the 19th century and the Pahlavis ( from 1921 to 1979 ) and the Islamic Revolution initiated by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979 are important to appreciate this highly sophisticated society .
The first point to note is that Iran is a very safe country to visit ; there are no terrorist attacks or muggings , and tourists , though relatively few in number , are everywhere welcomed with a genuine warmth and amazing hospitality .
Shiite Islam is of course the dominant religion in the country . As in New Zealand , many Iranians are not especially religious , and some are openly hostile to the Islamic Revolution . Nevertheless , many are ardent Muslims and the leaders of the Islamic Revolution have a firm control on how women dress and how men and women relate to each other . All women in public must wear a hijab or scarf , or face serious consequences . Women are not encouraged to appear in public with unrelated men , though the rules on this appear to be more lax than previously . Men do n't greet women with handshakes unless the woman offers their hand first ( usually they do n't ) , and certainly not with a kiss on the cheek as we are used to . Travellers to Iran need to be comfortable with this reality before they set out on their travels .

I found Iranians extremely hospitable and charming . They are part of a well-educated society and they are quick to tell you they are not Arabs , in spite of Arab neighbours . Indeed Iran is a surprisingly ethnically uniform country with a long history of Persian culture , in some ways a little like Japan . One does n't see many Chinese or African faces in this country , nor even many tourists , but just Iranians . There are 80 million of them .
Young Iranian women are very sophisticated and fashion conscious , and many find ways to express their femininity in spite of the hijab . Scarves often reveal more hair then the mullahs would wish , and bright lipstick and beautiful eye makeup are frequently seen . Another aspect of Persian culture is their universal love of poetry , and with great poets like Hafez , Saadi and Ferdowsi dating back to the middle ages and writing poems about love and wine long before Shakespeare 's time , one can understand why these icons of Persian culture are so revered . I visited the tombs of Hafez and Saadi in Shiraz , and after a lecture at Shiraz University , I was presented with a copy of the Divan of Hafez ( he lived 1325-89 ) containing their poems ( fortunately for me with English translations ) .
John Hearnshaw A typical highway just south of Isfahan in central Iran . The roads are good between cities , but the scenery is stark , mountainous and treeless .
Not all aspects of Iran will necessarily delight the traveller . One is the need to take cash such as US dollars or euros . Thanks to Uncle Sam , western credit cards are not used at all . Another is the traffic in Tehran , where most tourists will enter the country . You are far more likely to be driven than drive yourself , but even that is a hair-raising experience . Road rules seem non-existent except for the principle that they who dares first has priority . It 's no wonder that the death rate on the roads is some three times higher per capita than in New Zealand . And Aucklanders who bemoan their own traffic congestion should experience Tehran , a city that could accommodate some one million cars , but has over three million , and most of them seem to be on the road at any time .
I experienced many restaurants in Iran . The food was delicious but not very varied . If you are vegetarian or do n't relish a daily dose of kabab ( beef , lamb or chicken ) , then it 's better not to go . Compared with other parts of Asia such as Thailand , Chennai or Sechuan , the food is also very bland ; few spices or curries are used . On the other hand , no-one will go hungry in a Tehran restaurant ; typical dishes would be enough food for several people , and the food wastage was colossal . One discovery was a refreshing yoghurt drink called doogh , made from yoghurt , water , salt and mint . It was the best cold drink available , though I would have welcomed an occasional beer or cold wine ( both are strictly banned in the Islamic Republic ) . Not only is alcohol not available ( except on the black market ) but cigarette smoking is also quite rare . In two weeks , I only saw one smoker .
The landscape of central Iran which I visited from Tehran in the north to Shiraz in the south was dry , brown , mountainous , treeless and rather bleak . There was an austere beauty here , but the dry desert landscapes may tire the overland tourist . I believe it is the cities which fascinate westerners most , especially Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd .

I visited several universities in Iran and gave eight lectures to students and amateur astronomers . This was good fun , and their ability to understand English was impressive . After each lecture I was mobbed by young people who wanted to take a selfie with me , so that invariably took another hour after each talk . I happily obliged . Then there was the present giving . I came home with 40 kg of luggage , half of it being gifts showered on me at each venue , including books , a brass astrolabe , a decorative hand-painted plate , a woven tablecloth and a wool and silk floor rug . Any visitor needs to take presents to give to Iranian friends , and I was well prepared with a dozen books to give away .
Between a hectic schedule of lectures , interviews , restaurants and meeting young astronomers , one other activity I enjoyed was a day of hiking in the Alborz Mountains just north of Tehran . This was a scenic trail up a rugged rocky path high up Mt Daraband above Tehran . The track was popular for Tehranis at the weekend ( a Thursday in Islamic Iran ) and I enjoyed high mountain air and cooling off with feet in mountain streams , during a day of walking with a group of young Iranian students .

President Donald Trump is appointing an oil and gas industry lobbyist to help run the Interior Department — just as the agency is facing criticism from a federal watchdog over the ways it helps fossil fuel firms evade environmental rules .
Late last month , Trump nominated lawyer David Bernhardt to serve as Deputy Interior Secretary . Bernhardt would come to the role from their job as a partner at a major law firm that represents energy industry clients across the country . An International Business Times review of Bernhardt 's newly released financial disclosure forms shows they have personally represented Samson Resources , Cobalt International Energy and Westlands Water District — which have significant interests before the Interior Department that Bernhardt will now help run .

As Deputy Secretary of the Interior , Bernhardt would preside over the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) , the federal agency responsible for overseeing oil and gas drilling on the 245 million acres the bureau administers . If confirmed , Bernhardt would become part of an Interior Department leadership looking to open more land to energy interests , some of which they once represented .
Already , the Trump administration has begun opening up federal lands to the kind of fossil fuel exploration that could benefit Bernhardt 's previous clients . In February , the BLM made its largest lease sale in four years , selling drilling rights on 278 parcels of public land for a total of $ 129.3 million . In March , Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke ended a moratorium on coal-mining leases on federal land put in place by the Obama administration .
Zinke 's decision followed an executive order by President Trump calling on agencies to review regulations that “ potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources . ”
“ Unable To Provide Reasonable Assurance That It Is Meeting Its Environmental Responsibilities ”
Only a few weeks after Bernhardt 's nomination , the government 's General Accountability Office issued a report chastising the Bureau of Land Management for its oversight of oil and gas drilling . The report said the agency has been failing to adequately document how it uses waivers to let oil and gas firms get around environmental rules and drill on federal lands .
“ Because BLM does not consistently track exception request data or have a consistent process for considering requests and clearly documenting decisions , BLM may be unable to provide reasonable assurance that it is meeting its environmental responsibilities , ” the GAO wrote in a report released last month .
The GAO investigation surveyed 42 BLM offices , and found fewer than half tracked data on exception requests . The GAO also found that BLM did not use data from site inspections to evaluate whether its permit process was protecting the environment .
The report came shortly after a Gallup poll showed that 53 percent of respondents opposed oil exploration on federal lands — up from 34 percent in 2012 . The upward trend in opposition over the last five years occurs at the same time gas prices have dropped . As Gallup notes , in March 2012 , the price of a gallon of gas was $ 3.91 . By February 2017 , gas had fallen to an average price of $ 2.42 a gallon .
“ All Legislation Regarding The Leasing And Development Of Energy ”
Bernhardt has worked for energy clients of lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck after leaving a high-ranking job in the George W. Bush administration 's Interior Department in 2009 . While Bernhardt is no longer lobbying clients on behalf of their employer , the firm 's website still listed them as its Natural Resources Department chair as of Wednesday .
While Bernhardt is subject to a January executive order requiring all presidential appointees to pledge to recuse themselves from issues related to former clients for two years after taking office , appointees can receive waivers to that rule . Those waivers have been secret , which last week prompted the head of the Office of Government Ethics to request copies of all waivers be sent to their office by June 1 .
Federal lobbying records show Bernhardt has repeatedly lobbied on behalf of Samson Resources Company on “ issues regarding the development of energy on federal lands. ” Samson Resources leases 287,000 acres of land from the BLM , according to records provided to IBT by the Bureau . Bernhardt 's public disclosure filings show they have provided legal services to Noble Energy , which is leasing 202,000 acres from the Bureau .
Bernhardt has also repeatedly lobbied on “ all legislation regarding the leasing and development of energy on the Outer Continental Shelf ” on behalf of Cobalt International Energy . Drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf is overseen by the Interior Department 's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , which just last week ruled that four bids submitted by Cobalt for offshore tracts in the Gulf were “ acceptable . ”
While Bernhardt has provided legal services to other oil and gas industry clients , including the Independent Petroleum Association of America , much of their lobbying efforts have been on behalf of the Westlands Water District , one of the most profitable agricultural areas in the world . The water district has been involved with a long-standing dispute , which included a billion dollar lawsuit , with the Interior Department over costs of a federal water project and responsibility for the disposal of water polluted with selenium .
A HISTORY OF JAPANESE POLITICAL THOUGHT , 1600-1901 , by Hiroshi Watanabe . Translated by David Noble . LTCB International Library Trust , International House of Japan , 2012 , 543 pp. , ¥3,000 ( hardcover )
“ The evolution of political thought in this relatively isolated island nation during the period in question is unique to the point of being somewhat freakish , ” writes political thought scholar Hiroshi Watanabe of the University of Tokyo . This book , first published in 2010 , has been newly translated into English .
Maybe all ideas are inherently strange , given the nonsense time tends to make of them . Imagine how odd our thinking will seem 100 years from now — or would have seemed 100 years ago . Is “ freakish ” too strong a word ? Whether it is or not , the ideas Watanabe discusses here with such clarity and vigor are the ones that animated two of the most astonishing phases of Japanese and , arguably , world history : the 2½ centuries of peace under the Tokugawa shogunate ( 1600-1867 ) and the subsequent national transformation of backwater Japan into superpower Japan .
What were these ideas ? You could , simplifying just a bit , divide them into two categories : Confucian and anti-Confucian . For pre-modern Japan , China was civilization itself , and Confucianism was what made it so — “ perhaps the most powerful political ideology yet conceived by the human race , ” writes Watanabe . To devotees , its “ rites and music , ” “ five relationships ” and “ five virtues ” are what separate us from the beasts and make us human . To doubters — and the doubts grew as Japan 's stagnation became more evident — it was a retarding force . “ Ours is a world in which living things are confined and regimented as if dead things , ” wrote one exasperated samurai-scholar in 1838 .
The “ freakishness ” under discussion , then , lies in Confucianism and what the Japanese made of it . Certainly the modern mind , restless , striving , acquisitive , forward-looking , has little patience with the Confucian yearning for a long-past , long-lost Golden Age ruled by sages whose virtue alone made the people good , happy and prosperous . That thinking resonates no longer and is n't likely ever to again . The trouble was , it rang a little false even under the early Tokugawa when neo-Confucianism was promoted as an official ideology .
Japan was a warrior society ; China was not . To a Chinese proverb asserting “ Good men do not make soldiers just as good iron does not make nails , ” a Japanese one counters , “ As the cherry among blossoms , so the warrior among men. ” True , Tokugawa Japan was a warrior society “ at peace , ” but warrior peace is not Confucian peace . Pax Tokugawa , writes Watanabe , amounted to “ waiting for a battle that never seemed to come. ” They quote a samurai 's poem : “ What a waste ! / Born into times so fortunate/ That I must die lying at home on the tatami ! ”
Self-sacrifice on the battlefield having become an unrealizable ideal , other ways took shape of showing devotion to one 's lord . One was junshi — committing suicide upon the lord 's death . “ It was an odd form of ‘ love suicide , ' “ writes Watanabe — outlawed in 1663 but to little avail . If a form of filial piety , it was hardly one a Chinese Confucian would have recognized .
What becomes of a warrior society in the absence of war ? “ Domination by force inevitably devolved into domination by the image of force , ” writes Watanabe . Government became theater , and etiquette became the script : “ The entire country was a vast chain of those who were bowed to and those who did the bowing . ”
Discontent simmered . “ Japan is a martial nation , ” fumed samurai-scholar Kaibara Ekiken ( 1630-1714 ) . “ The path of a soldier is a deceitful one … It would be impossible to triumph here following the undissembling and soft customs of the Chinese , for those are not the customs of Japan . ”
The warrior spirit was bursting its Confucian bonds . “ Preaching that all people within the four seas should have prosperous and bountiful households and that everyone should be protected from poverty and suffering is the idle talk of vulgar Confucians , ” wrote another military scholar , Tsugaru Kodo ( 1682-1729 ) .
How long can proud but stagnant isolation endure in a busy , changing , expanding world ? The incursions in 1853 and 1854 by the American “ black ships ” make a convenient historical boundary between old and new , but were “ a comparatively minor external blow , ” says Watanabe — the old order had long been crumbling . Leading the charge against it were warrior clans rallying under the cry “ Joi ” — “ expel the barbarians. ” But , overthrowing the shogun and seizing power in the name of the Emperor Meiji , they did n't expel the barbarians ; they imitated them , and turned Japan into the Westernized , industrialized nation we know today .
The Meiji Era ( 1867-1912 ) was many things to many people , but decidedly it was a revolution — political , economic , technological , military . It had all the modern virtues and vices except one — democracy . And yet even democracy 's seeds were sown — by activist rebels like Nakae Chomin ( 1847-1901 ) , cofounder of Japan 's first ever political party and author of books with titles like “ Awakening the Common Man. ” Nakae , like many of the figures Watanabe introduces us to , is little known today but of endless interest . ( He was enough of a liberal to translate Jean-Jacques Rousseau 's “ The Social Contract , ” yet enough of a Confucian to translate it not into Japanese but into classical Chinese . ) Nakae 's optimism at the close of the period covered by this book is touching and inspiring : “ Although our 19th-century society , as reflected in the pure looking-glass of philosophy , can not escape being darkened by a variety of evils , in comparison with previous eras it is moving gradually in the direction of the victory of reason and the defeat of injustice . ”
Michael Hoffman 's latest novel is “ The Naked Ear . ”
To understand just how bad the politics of Obama 's now-withdrawn plan to tax 529 college savings were , think about it this way : Obama , under heavy pressure from both Democrats and Republicans , made a public show of pulling a proposal that already had no chance of passing .
Even as an inert fantasy proposal , it was so widely disliked that the White House had to back down .
It 's a minor but revealing political fiasco—one that shows how distant the White House is even from the interests of its own party while offering a preview of economic policy debates and welfare-state fiscal challenges for decades to come .
The political optics of the plan were flat-out terrible for Obama , who put forth the proposal in the context of a State of the Union address built around the theme of Middle Class Economics . The gist was that Obama proposed taxing the wealthy in order to pay for new middle class benefits , like free community college tuition .
But , somewhat awkwardly , given the president 's chosen theme , 529 plans are tax-advantaged savings vehicles that currently benefit an awful lot of middle class people . In particular , they benefit middle and upper-middle class families in high-tax blue states .
So it is not exactly surprising to find that , in addition to the entirely predictable GOP pushback against the proposal , Rep. Nancy Pelosi , a Democrat from California , and Rep. Chris Van Hollen , a Democrat from Maryland , lead a seperate Democratic push for the White House to drop the plan . This is an administration that is now so isolated and out of touch that it does not grasp the obvious interests of its own party .
The plan was also tremendously awkward for Obama himself . As the folks at Americans for Tax Reform have noted , Obama was not only a public booster of 529s , someone who as a Senator voted to make them permanent and praised them as tools to help families with college expenses in their book , they were also someone who had relied on a 529 himself , contributing $ 240,000 to a 529 college fund for their own children back in 2007 . Obama took advantage of the plan 's tax benefits—then proposed closing the door behind him .
As political miscalculations go , this was a minor epic . This was a major component of Obama 's slate of State of the Union proposals , previewed and highlighted in a white paper released several days earlier . And yet somehow the White House seems to have managed not to solicit input from members of its own party in Congress , and to ignore Obama 's personal history on the issue . The backlash to this proposal was entirely predictable , and yet the White House seems to have been caught by surprise .
How does a political miscalculation like this happen ?
One possible answer is that it 's just an inevitable symptom of an isolated second-term administration that is openly bored with Congress and out of touch with everyone outside its inner circle of supporters .
But another possibility is that this is the sort of plan than inevitably follows from the long-term fiscal logic of the welfare state .
Yes , the budget wars have calmed recently as annual deficits have fallen and the economy has improved . But total national debt remains at historic highs , and medium to long-term budget prognosis is still rather grim .
The core of the problem is clear : the growing cost of the entitlement state . As the Congressional Budget Office warned earlier this week , over the next decade , `` spending will grow faster than the economy for Social Security ; the major health care programs , including Medicare , Medicaid , and subsidies offered through insurance exchanges ; and net interest costs . '' Tax revenues will stay essentially flat at around 18 percent of GDP , while spending , driven by entitlements , will rise to more than 22 percent of GDP . Longer-term projections indicate the cost of entitlements and interest on the debt will continue to rise in the decades after that .
In the bigger picture , the existing welfare state is unaffordable . Either it will have to be cut , or reformed , or paid for—by someone , somehow . The administration and its allies would like to reassure you that the someones who will pay for all of this will be limited to the richest of the rich , but in practice there 's only so much money that can be squeezed out of the extremely wealthy .
Which means that eventually , anyone looking for ways to keep the welfare state afloat will have to go after after the middle class—and , in particular , middle class savers . That 's where the money is . Sure , you can imagine alternatives , like a Value Added Tax ( VAT ) , which might raise enough tax revenue to keep the budget in the clear . But it 's hard to imagine a popular political coalition forming around a regressive consumption tax that gives the government a major new revenue stream .
If anything , it 's far easier to imagine a popular coalition forming in opposition to such a plan . That 's more or less exactly what happened with Obama 's 529 proposal .
And it 's why this episode and the swift bipartisan opposition it generated is so revealing , not only about the short term political instincts of the Obama administration , but about the longer term political and policy dynamics of sustaining the welfare state . If this is the reaction to a policy that was never going to pass , and , indeed , never really designed to pass , imagine the backlash to a middle class tax hike that was actually intended to go into effect . The White House may not want to acknowledge this problem , but that 's the reality of , well , middle class economics .
The other day , I started watching Breaking Bad . I realize I 'm one of the last people on earth to see the ratings giant but I found one character fascinating .
Walter White .
Walt has an ordinary life . They work in a job below their pay scale and ability , has a social life that stinks , and spends most weekends at work or in the shopping mall . It 's a safe , steady life but one full of monotony and boredom .
When Walt finds out he 's dying , they jump into action to change the course of their life and focus on what really needs to be done . Sure , they make a bad decision there , but the point is that they re-evaluate their life and figures out what their priorities are once they get the bad news .
Walt 's predicament got me thinking about death and the way we live our lives . Death comes to us all sooner or later but why do we always wait for bad news before we launch into action ?
Mark Manson touches upon the power of knowing your time is up in ' 7 Strange Questions That Help You Find Your Life Purpose ' . They believe death is a great motivator for thinking about what 's important . And it 's not hard to agree .
Because most of us live a life just like Walt 's .
We work our butts off and we hang out at the mall . We watch too much TV and we skip exercise in favor of the bag of chips or bowl of ice cream . We know we could do better but the day-to-day has a habit of getting in the way . We 'll change our routine tomorrow , research a new career next week and look for greater meaning in our lives once the kids have gone to bed .
There 's no ultimatum . No deadline . No pressure . So we plod through life accepting the status quo even though , silently , we 're craving for more .
But what if , like Walt , we had a limited time left on this earth . Would we re-evaluate the things of importance to us ? If we knew this was it , that our days were numbered , would we take back the control and fight for more ?
Of course we would .
We 'd write that book , complete that course , travel around the world and maybe even discover an exciting new lifestyle abroad .
Or we 'd add greater meaning to our lives in other , less extreme , ways . Perhaps we 'd say `` no '' not as much , be kinder to ourselves and to others , embrace what we love in life , and focus on the people and things that matter most .
We 'd look at our lives -- the lengthy commute to work , the long periods away from home , the corporate crap with its unrelenting hours , the way we define success -- and we 'd say `` not interested , '' `` no , thank you , '' and `` no more . ''
We 'd strive for more , push harder , look deeper . We would n't accept the way things are so we 'd adjust the edges , widen the boundaries and search for greater meaning and fulfilment , knowing that our time on this earth was limited .
But our time is limited and it is finite so should n't we live life like this all the time ?
Oftentimes fear is the culprit . Fear of the unknown . Fear of uncertainty . Fear of change .
We already live in uncertain times -- politically , economically and socially -- so we cling on to any semblance of order and control in our lives . We work hard to provide for our families and find ourselves caught up in the daily 9-5 grind .
In my early 20s , I worked in a job going nowhere . By 28 , I 'd spent the best part of my early years in a town that did n't inspire me . As I hit my thirties , I led an existence that left me wanting for so much more .
I needed that important kick up the bum and the idea of change was terrifying , paralyzing . So much so that I chose the easy option and the path of less resistance . I stayed put .
Looking back , I needed to face my fears and be strong , confident and brave -- all traits that simply did n't come easily to me .
We all wait to the last minute to act . People just do .
I mean , when was the last time you turned in an essay four weeks early or finished that company report months ahead of schedule ? Rather than leave it so late , it has to be better to get on with things before our time is up .
We 're not all going to climb Everest or swim the English Channel but what 's wrong with making a few small changes along the way ? A tweak here , an adjustment there , because small changes can still have a big impact on the quality of our lives .
Rather than work 9-5 , what about trying 8-4 ? Now you might spend only two hours in the traffic where before you spent more than three . You might get home in time to pick up the kids from school and have a better chance of taking them to the park one afternoon . The old adage `` work smarter , not harder '' has never been truer . And , in these times , flexible working is key .
So we need to start living life on our terms and identify what 's important versus what does n't actually matter . Consider that our time on this planet is finite and start to live our lives with the kind of haste that normally follows bad news .
What will you do differently ? What legacy do you choose to leave ?

No Bipartisan Consensus ? Time To Use The Majority !
The last 48 hours have served as a clarifying moment in the health care debate .
First , the White House sent out trial balloons this weekend on abandoning the public option . Progressives were not amused and organized intensely for the first time this summer . Finally the left is matching the intensity of the right – and it took a perceived betrayal by the White House to do it .
Second , just as progressive Democrats fixed their bayonets , the Republican leadership made it abundantly clear that they had no intention of supporting co-ops or anything else coming out of the Senate Finance Committee . The GOP , whether for ideological or political reasons – or both – decided to play the 1994 Bill Kristol card and refuse to participate any longer .
And now the White House is taking notice : there is no more bipartisan basis for negotiation . The GOP , which itself only counts 39 Senators ( without Martinez ) has left the negotiating table . Without Republicans , the nature of negotiations AMONG Democrats will change dramatically . The debate will shift somewhat to the left as the rightward ballast has disappeared .
President Obama campaigned to a large extent on the idea of consensus politics . They believed that there was broad agreement across the political spectrum on a variety of issues , including health care . Though support for Obama 's handling of the health care issue has suffered this summer , the public at large – and Independents in particular – still credit Obama for at least trying to work with Republicans . The same was true for the stimulus .
But the reality of Washington is that the GOP has been reduced to its ideological core . There are very few moderates left in the party . The issues surrounding health care have shown themselves to be laden with all sorts of ideological baggage , and the Republican Party has only played up those ideological consequences ( as is their right ) .
And so it 's time to turn to the only poll that matters : November 2008 . In that election the electorate not only gave Obama a solid majority – the largest for a Democrat since 1964 – but also elected 59 Democratic Senators…and one more switched to the Dems . The House Democratic caucus also moved significantly to the left .
Elections have consequences . There is nothing immoderate in suggesting that the majority – even the supermajority of 60-39 – has the right to rule in Congress . As a matter of style and principle President Obama sought bipartisan consensus . It was also a matter of good politics as the public likes the idea of cooperation across party lines . Some insecure Democrats also liked the idea that if the public revolted against the plan they would have bipartisan cover .
But that 's not how things are shaking out . Health care will be decided by the Democratic majority elected largely for that very purpose . And that is as it should be .
President Obama will likely be working with the conservative Democrats in the Senate – Baucus , Conrad , Bayh , Landrieu , Nelson and Lincoln . Once they remind these Senators that there will be no bipartisan cover , they should make this request : oppose the public option if your conscience or your constituents demand . But do NOT support a GOP filibuster of it . Considering that Republicans have abandoned the table , it should become obvious to these right-leaning Democrats that NO deal with the GOP is possible and that a vote for a filibuster ( against cloture ) would be a vote against any and all health care reform . Period .
There are some issues in politics where bipartisan consensus simply does not exist . This August has only driven that point home . It 's time for Democrats to use the majority that the American people put in place last November .
After our first visit to PAX South this year , agent86ix and I learned a lot . We also had the chance to visit a large number of PAX Exhibitors for the first time and while the experience was still fresh in our minds I wanted to share our impressions of the best practices for PAX Exhibitors . Read on for some tips to fine tune your exhibition for better media exposure .
Pre-Show
In the next section I 'll talk about things to do before the conference event . These are things that will take some prep time or some consideration . You can probably start thinking about them right now .
To Demo or not to Demo
I highly recommend sharing copies of your game with media before the conference . Several developers did so for PAX South , and both agent86ix and I picked up these games and were well versed in them by the time the show rolled around . What 's more – these demos increased the likelihood for us to put one of those developers on our “ must visit ” list during the show . Nothing gets a gamers attention like being able to play a game .
If you have reasons to not share a demo , or are not at a point where you are prepared to , be sure to at least have some type of explanation of your project out on the web for media to review . A video , some concept art , or even a text description is a lot better than nothing . A surprising number of exhibitors had little to no information about the game they were working on posted on the web .
Floor prep
Before pitching in my two cents let me first recommend excellent post-mortems by Bishop Games and tinyBuild . Those guys both picked up on the need to have a large number of game setups , to try and keep wait times to a minimum . If possible I 'd suggest having one “ extra ” station that is somewhat more secluded to allow for media interviews , especially if you are scheduling meet ups . There were probably half a dozen games we skipped during the conference because the lines were just too long . We meant to come back , but never had the time . If you are n't getting many media visits you can always use it to cut down on the main queue .
I 'd also like to emphasize the need to keep your demo short . I 'd shoot for around 5 minutes . Excessive demo length was probably the most common problem among PAX South exhibitors – and agent86ix and I were puzzled why so many demos were so long . Summarizing is an art , and I 'm sure it can be hard to distill the best parts of your game into such a short time – but you have to try . Long demos translate directly to long waits , and in the end that just means fewer media and gamers will get to experience your product .
Pro Tip An old trick I appreciate in a lot of demos is a short “ and there 's more ” video at the end . This is a great way to show additional levels that are n't complete , abilities that are hard to master quickly , or in general anything about your vision for the game .

The suspected gunman who opened fire Friday at Fort Lauderdale International Airport , killing five people , has been identified by officials as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago .
They were booked by the Broward County Sherriff 's Office .
On Saturday , officials announced Santiago would face federal charges in the deadly shooting including killing five people , performing an act of violence against a person in an airport , and using a firearm in a crime .
According to the complaint , Santiago was `` aiming at their victims ' heads until they were out of ammunition . ''
If convicted , they could face a life sentence in prison .
Six more people were injured after the gunman opened fire around 1 p.m. at the airport , officials said . ( An earlier injury toll of eight was revised down on Saturday to six ) .
`` Indications are that they came here to carry out this horrific attack . We have not identified any triggers that would have caused this attack , '' FBI Special Agent in Charge George Piro told reporters Saturday , but added the `` early indication is that there was no specific reason '' as to why they chose Fort Lauderdale airport .
Piro said authorities have found no evidence of any altercation on a flight or in the terminal that might have prompted Santiago to open fire , but they cautioned that the investigation was still in its early stages .
The chief of the Anchorage airport police department told BuzzFeed News that Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale on a Delta flight , with their gun as their only checked luggage . Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida , who was first to identify Santiago , cited a military ID that was found on the gunman during their arrest .
The 26-year-old Anchorage resident was a member of the Alaska National Guard until August 2016 when they were discharged for `` unsatisfactory performance , '' Lt. Col. Olmstead said in a statement .
Santiago began their military service when they joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in 2007 and was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011 , Olmstead said . Santiago was in the Army Reserves before joining the Alaska Army National Guard in November 2014 where they were a combat engineer . At the time of their discharge , they were a private first class .
Some of the mystery has been taken out of it , but Google has officially taken the wraps off of the Nexus 7 , its first reference-grade tablet . The 7-inch slate is the first and currently only device shipping with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean , and takes advantage of its optimization for smaller tablet screens , magazines and movies -- it 's also the first to ship with a finished Chrome for Android . Like what was widely suspected , the tablet is built by ASUS ( shades of Eee Pad MeMO ME370T , anyone ? ) and mostly draws our attention in terms of what we get for the money : that quad-core Tegra 3 , 1.2-megapixel front camera , NFC and 1280 x 800 , IPS-based LCD are traits we 'd normally look for in a pricier tablet . How much pricier , you ask ? Google is asking just $ 199 for a dainty 8GB model and $ 249 for a 16GB version -- that 's a lot of speed for the money , especially with a $ 25 Google Play credit and a slew of bundled content . There 's no SD card slot , however . We 'll test the Nexus 7 as soon as we can , but you can swing by Google Play ( and possibly local stores ) to order one in Australia , Canada , the UK and the US with a mid-July shipping window .

By Edward McClelland
Last Thanksgiving , I was in Houston , visiting my wife 's family .
“ How far is it from here to Dallas ? ” I asked my sister-in-law .
“ To where ? ” they asked . “ To Dale 's house ? ”
Using the speech patterns I picked up during my childhood in industrial Michigan , I had pronounced the name of Texas 's second-largest city “ Dayul-is. ” That 's what linguists call “ short-a ” rising , and it 's a signature feature of the Inland North accent , a barbed , nasal strain of English spoken in the Lower Great Lakes region , from Rochester , N.Y. on the east to Davenport , Iowa , on the west – an area roughly coterminous with the Rust Belt . ( It 's said to begin between exits 41 and 42 on the New York State Thruway . East of that invisible line , in Syracuse , people say “ soda. ” West of the line , in Rochester , they say “ pop . ” )
Accents are an important element of regional identity . An important element of Midwestern identity is believing you do n't have an accent , that you speak a neutral brand of standardized English from which all other Americans deviate . It 's not true . In fact , those of us from the Upper Midwest speaks a strain of English so revolutionary it 's changing the way vowels have been pronounced for more than a millennium .
[ blocktext align= ” right ” ] Accents are an important element of regional identity . An important element of Midwestern identity is believing you do n't have an accent … It 's not true . [ /blocktext ] The Inland North accent as we know it began to develop in the early 20th century , as a result of one of the most remarkable linguistic transitions of the modern era : the Northern Cities Vowel Shift . Vowels whose pronunciations had been stable since feudal England suddenly began taking on new inflections in the mouths of Upper Midwesterners . The changes were first detected by linguists doing field research in Chicago and Detroit in the late 1960s . In their book Dialect Diversity in America , University of Pennsylvania linguist William Labov describes them as a series , or chain , of changes . The Northern Cities Vowel Shift affected five separate vowel sounds , but Labov believes it was triggered by the short “ a ” that makes the word “ Dallas ” incomprehensible to Texans .
“ The logic that connects these five changes resembled a game of ‘ musical chairs , ' ” in which each inhabitant of a position moves one unit to dislodge the next , ” Labov wrote . “ The initiating event appears to be the shift of short-a in bat to a front , raised position , a sound very much like the vowel of yeah…Into the gap created by this shift , the vowel of got moves forward . In the most extreme form , cot sounds like cat , block like black , socks like sacks…The vowel of bought then moves down and front toward this position , along with other members of the “ long open-o ” word class : law , talk , cross , dawn , dog , etc…Short-e then shifts to the back toward short-u , producing a confusion between desk and dusk as short-e enters short-u territory . Most recently , short-u has responded to the intrusion by moving back , producing the potential confusion between busses and bosses , cud and cawed…The chain shift has come full circle . ”
These pronunciations should sound familiar to anyone who has eavesdropped on a conversation between two on-break sales associates at the Golf Mill Mall in Niles , Ill. , or ordered a coney dog and fries from a waiter at Angelo 's Coney Island in Flint , Mich. For an audio demonstration , here 's Labov discussing the Shift with Robert MacNeil on the PBS series Do You Speak American ? And here 's an Inland North accents compilation I found on YouTube . ( The Cleveland Browns fans at the end are the most perfect example ever of the Northern Cities Vowel Shift . )
“ Just in terms of numbers , you 're talking about a lot of vowels moving around , that 's a pretty significant thing , ” says Matthew Gordon , an associate professor of English at the University of Missouri . “ Some of these particular vowels , the short i , the short a , the short e , those have been pretty stable throughout the history of English , for over 1,000 years . ”
While researching their University of Michigan doctoral thesis , Small Town Values and Big-City Vowels : A Study of the Northern Cities Shift in Michigan , Gordon listened to recordings of Grand Rapidians born in the late 19th century . None of them produced the vowel inflections associated with the Shift . ( Neither did President Gerald Ford , who was raised in Grand Rapids in the 1910s and 20s . )
“ When you listen to them , they do n't sound at all like modern Michiganders , ” Gordon says . “ All the evidence seems to show the Northern Cities Shift got started some time in the 20th century , and really got ramped up . Definitely , the first half of the 20th century was when it progressed to the point you would really hear it like you do today . ”
But why did the Shift start then , and why has it been confined to the Inland North accent region ? Labov theorizes that its origins date back nearly two hundred years , when New Englanders , New Yorkers , and immigrants arrived in upstate New York to dig the Erie Canal . From this melting pot of dialects emerged a single system , in which the short “ a ” was always raised . The new dialect then spread westward , as settlers followed the canal into the Great Lakes .
However , both Gordon and David Durian , a linguist who studies Chicago speech , have observed that the fronting of the short “ o ” – the phenomenon that makes Saturday Night Live 's Superfans talk about “ Polish saaahsage ” – appeared in Midwestern speech before the raising of the “ a . ”
“ That suggests to me that maybe it 's the ‘ box ' vowel – pronouncing ‘ box ' like ‘ baaax ' – that got it started and sort of pushed the other ones out of the way , ” Gordon says .
( SNL also mocked the Inland North accent with “ 1-600-LANSING , ” a fake ad about a phone sex line for men turned on by women with nasal Michigan accents .. So did Family Guy : you can hear the raised “ a ” and fronted “ o ” in this clip about a Wisconsin nymphomaniac . )
At graduate school in Ann Arbor , and during their research in Chelsea and Paw Paw , Gordon found that Michiganders were perplexed by their interest in their accents , because , of course , there 's absolutely nothing exotic about Michigan speech . I myself was not aware that short “ a ” raising is unique to the Upper Midwest until I went away to the University of Michigan , where a student from New Jersey pointed it out to me .
“ It 's part of the reputation the Midwest has of being the standard , ” Gordon says . “ This is particularly strong in Michigan . Michiganders are very convinced that they speak without any kind of accent . I think that that ideology : this is standard English , this is the English that broadcasters use , kind of leads people to not hear how different their speech is until they travel outside the area . … I went to grad school at the University of Michigan , and when you talked to students in linguistics classes , one of the questions they ask you is , ‘ Why do n't we have an accent ? ' I think that feeling of speaking in a somewhat pure way is more particular to Michigan . I think Chicagoans have a stronger sense that there 's something interesting going on with their speech . It 's something about the Michigan educational system , just growing up in Michigan is being taught that Michigan is perfect . ”
[ blocktext align= ” left ” ] As the Rust Belt has become less powerful , less populous , and less influential , so has its native accent . [ /blocktext ] Chicagoans , on the other hand , have been altering their distinctive speech patters to conform to “ standard ” American speech , says Durian , a native of Chicago 's south suburbs and an adjunct professor of English at the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn , Ill . The tendency to replace “ th ” with “ d ” – as in “ dese , dem and dose ” – has been disappearing .
“ It 's kind of like what 's happening in Pittsburgh , ” Durian says . “ People would say you knew you were in Pittsburgh because you heard people say ‘ dahntahn ' all the time , instead of ‘ downtown . ' Among speakers born after 1980 or so , they 're not doing that ‘ dahntahn ' thing anymore . They 're starting to pronounce it like the rest of the country , where it 's more of a normal pronunciation . I think the same thing is happening in Chicago , and it 's for the same reason . It 's become so stereotyped as a pronunciation , and it 's pointed out so often in speech that people are actually shifting away from it . ”
In fact , Durian is beginning to hear the Northern Cities Vowel Shift weaken among younger speakers . Its rise to linguistic distinction and its subsequent subsumation into generic American speech seems to be coterminous with the industrial Midwest 's own rise and decline . As the Rust Belt has become less powerful , less populous , and less influential , so has its native accent .
“ When they were going through a period of growth , up until about 1950 , the times that these vowel shifts were most active were up through that sort of World War II period , ” Durian says . “ And then what happens from 1950 to 2000 , you see the shifts slowly beginning to shift towards eroding . So it seemed that as the population decreased in these cities , that 's also had an impact on the shifts beginning to erode .
“ We 're now starting to hear speakers who were born in 1990 or 1995 going back or starting to show some reversal of some of the Shift traits , ” they continue . “ For example , they 're starting to back their cot vowel , the short ‘ o ' , back to where thought is . They 're not showing any further advancement of raising short ‘ a . ' Possibly among these younger speakers , we may be starting to see the emergence of a more generic American accent . … I think regional identity still matters to some extent , but I do n't think it matters as much as it did fifty years ago . I think now people are more likely to identify with the idea that you 're a Midwesterner , rather than a Chicagoan or a Clevelander . That may be having some influence on reducing some of those stronger characteristics . ”
First the Rust Belt lost its factories , then it lost its people . Now it 's losing its accent , too .

Edward McClelland is the author of Nothin ' but Blue Skies : The Heyday , Hard Times and Hopes of America 's Industrial Heartland .
Order Edward McClelland 's expanded , book-length version of this article coming from Belt Publishing in December 2016 .
UNIVERSITY PARK , Pa. -- Water has been detected in the atmosphere of a planet outside our solar system with a new technique that could help researchers to learn how many planets with water , like Earth , exist throughout the universe . The team of scientists that made the discovery includes astronomers at Penn State and other institutions .
The astronomers detected the water in the atmosphere of a planet as massive as Jupiter that is orbiting the nearby star tau Boötis . They describe their discovery in the Feb. 24 online version of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Chad Bender , a research associate in the Penn State Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and a co-author of the paper , said `` Planets like tau Boötes b , which are as massive as Jupiter but much hotter , do not exist in our solar system . Our detection of water in the atmosphere of tau Boötes b is important because it helps us understand how these exotic hot-Jupiter planets form and evolve . It also demonstrates the effectiveness of our new technique , which detects the infrared radiation in the atmospheres of these planets . ''
Scientists previously had detected water vapor on a handful of other planets , using a technique that works only if a planet has an orbit that passes it in front of its star , when viewed from Earth . Scientists also were able to use another imaging technique that works only if the planet is sufficiently far away from its host star . However , significant portions of the population of extrasolar planets do not fit either of these criteria , and there had not been a way to discover information about the atmospheres of these planets .
`` We now are applying our effective new infrared technique to several other nontransiting planets orbiting stars near the sun , '' Bender said . `` These planets are much closer to us than the nearest transiting planets , but largely have been ignored by astronomers because directly measuring their atmospheres with previously existing techniques was difficult or impossible . ''
With the new detection technique and more-powerful future telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Thirty Meter Telescope , the astronomers expect to be able to examine the atmospheres of planets that are much cooler and more distant from their host stars , where liquid water is even more likely to exist .
Bender is leading a larger project to characterize the atmospheres of many hot-Jupiter extrasolar planets . The tau Boötis discovery is one subcomponent of this larger project . The data analysis and publication of the tau Boötis discovery was led by Alexandra Lockwood at Caltech as part of their thesis with their adviser , Geoffrey Blake , professor of cosmochemistry and planetary sciences and professor of chemistry at Caltech . Much of the initial data reduction for this discovery was carried out by Alexander Richert , a Penn State graduate student .
The findings appear in the The Astrophysical Journal Letters in a paper titled `` Near-IR Direct Detection of Water Vapor in tau Boötis b . '' The co-authors of the paper are at institutions including CalTech , Penn State , the Naval Research Laboratory , the University of Arizona and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics . The work was funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program , the David and Lucile Packard and Alfred P. Sloan foundations , and the Penn State Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds .

Pitchfork : Given your tangled relationship with the idea of pop music , I wonder if a song like “ Dream Lover ” —which has this blown-out Springsteen feel—is poking fun at people who like Bruce Springsteen .
DB : Well , I do n't like to think of songs as toying with people , or doing clever things , or relating to society , because it gets too depressing for me . My songs all just have to be striving for the light . [ laughs ] All I know is when I 'm writing , I 'm trying to get to the heart of something . And then when I 'm singing , I 'm trying even harder to get at the heart of something . Not to toot my own horn , but I think I 'm really starting to find myself as a singer now . This is the first record that I 've ever done that comes close to my idea of myself as a singer . I 'm finally getting to this point where I can inhabit a song in a way that seems emotional but still recognizable to me and to my idea of what melodiousness can be . I used to revel in abandoning melody , and then on Kaputt it was just like , “ Focus on the notes , sing the notes , be the notes. ” Finally , with this record , I 've gotten to a place that 's more than either of those things .
That said , I do n't really like Bruce Springsteen—but I can accept defeat if someone says [ “ Dream Lover ” ] sounds like Wild and Innocent ... or whatever album that `` Rosalita '' song is on . That 's just a matter of taste , though , because if I like “ Young Americans ” and do n't like Springsteen , my whole thing is shit really . Over the last 11 years or so , I 've mostly just listened to Van Morrison , Joni Mitchell , and Bob Dylan . What speaks to me in Van Morrison 's music is that it 's real—there 's basically a religious need in their music , and their approach does n't stray from that . Also , I like the fact that jazz exercises a dubious influence on him , as I hope it exercises a dubious influence on me , too .
Pitchfork : There are several allusions to religious ideas and figures throughout Poison Season , which made me curious about your own religious background .
DB : My mom 's Jewish and my dad was Spanish and raised Catholic , and together they raised us as nothing at all . So it 's just a style of writing that I am attracted to . It 's moving to me because involves a struggle and very noble futility—divine futility . It could also be a really hack songwriter path for me to follow after listening to Christian-era Dylan or Christian-era Van Morrison . But that version of a struggle for meaning is pretty front and center to what someone like Leonard Cohen does , too , even if it 's all from the place of a fallen man and ideas of redemption .
Pitchfork : Those songwriters were often living out their beliefs , but it sounds like you 're approaching religion from more of an arm 's length .
DB : I ca n't live it , but I do n't think you have to live it to have it be something that it sparks you to open your mouth . You ca n't really write anything in the shadow of death without that struggle rearing its head , right ? If you address death or decay , you 're bound to hit it .
I would keep any kind of doctrine at arm 's length , as opposed to any kind of furious mystical writing , which I would not keep at arm 's length and would generously embrace . There 's a big difference . In the end , the mystic tradition is way more typical with those singers ; when they actually went to bat for one of these religions , it just came off as hokey and something they would cast off quite quickly , like what Bob Dylan did in the early ‘ 80s . But what stayed behind is this mystic resonance to the songs , which is still there , stronger than ever , right now .
Pitchfork : These people you 're talking about all have been making albums for many decades with ups and downs along the way . You have been making records for about 20 years now and have yet to start sucking . That 's pretty rare .
DB : I feel like the time-release poison could still be inside of me ; I 'm ready to completely lose sight of all that is good . [ laughs ] Being from North America , the proper backdrop for me to age gracefully as a singer/songwriter/poet type generally entails me embracing some form of Americana or roots or folk music . And while I listen to tons of that stuff , I do n't gravitate toward it when I make music . I always end up doing these things that half sound like pop music to people ; I can tell you as much as I can that it 's not pop music , but I do n't know if that counts .
It really is rare for singer/songwriters to not end up shitty , but with rock bands it 's just impossible . There 's something about rock where if you 're going for it in your 40s , you 're doing something that 's either different than what you were doing in your 20s or you 're aping your younger self , and that 's definitely not blowing people away . But at the same time , not to defend my own age group , but pop culture is ageist . If you 're a singer or a dancer or an actor and you get to your 40s , you 're fucked—and 99 % of me thinks it serves people right for getting into showbiz in the first place , so I do n't want to plead their case . [ laughs ] But some small part of me thinks that it must be possible to address concerns that are n't specific to teenagers in music and have it be good . It ca n't be this impossible feat that it currently feels like . There must be some other force at work .
Last month , a new ANA commercial hit the airwaves — and quickly ran into some serious turbulence .
The scene is Haneda Airport . Two Japanese men dressed as pilots stand with their backs to the camera .
“ Haneda has more international flights nowadays , ” says one .
“ Finally , ” replies the other .
“ Next stop , Vancouver , ” the first man says .
“ Next stop , Hanoi , ” their friend replies .
“ Exciting , is n't it ? ”
“ You want a hug ? ” the taller man says , out of nowhere . The shorter man stares at them in bewilderment .
The man who proposed hugging criticizes him , saying , “ Such a Japanese reaction . ”
“ Because I am Japanese , ” the man says in their defense .
“ I see , ” says their partner , before falling into a contemplative silence . “ Let 's change the image of Japanese people . ”
When the camera returns to the shorter man , they are wearing a blond wig and a false nose of Pinocchio proportions . “ Sure , ” they say .
A voiceover then intones the All Nippon Airways slogan , “ From Haneda to the world , ANA , ” and the commercial ends .
As soon as this ad aired , ANA was inundated with criticism . The thrust of the complaints was that the ad was racist and exaggerated the physical features of white people to point of mocking them .
ANA did not seem to have anticipated such a reaction . It swiftly apologized and removed the offending final image from the clip on TV and online . ( Though it was only the TV commercial that received criticism , they also took down posters of one of the actors from the commercial wearing the traditional dress of various countries . )
What interested me in particular was the difference between the reactions of Japanese and foreigners who saw this ad . At my labor union there are members of many different nationalities , the large majority of whom expressed unhappiness or indignation toward the ad . “ How did they fail to anticipate this would offend people ? ” many asked .
On the other hand , Japanese people I know reacted with bewilderment . “ It 's certainly childish , ” their comments tended to run , “ but I could n't call it racist . On the contrary , since blond hair and big noses are something that in Japanese culture have long been held up as attractive , the ad is more an expression of Japanese people 's sense of inferiority . ”
My personal opinion is that the ad is a disappointing anachronism , and a reminder of the parochial outlook of large Japanese corporations . The ad appeals to the facile formula that “ foreigner = white = blonde and big-nosed = English-speaking = globalization. ” But this feels bizarrely outdated and out of place coming from ANA , a major carrier trying to depict the airport generically — and Haneda in particular — as some sort of stage for exchange between the world 's many races and nationalities . Instead , the ad unintentionally shows that the Japanese archetype of the gaijin ( foreigner ) remains as strong as ever .
So why is it that so many of the Japanese people I spoke to could n't understand why foreigners would be angry about this “ racist ” ad ? I think , fundamentally , it has to do with the very narrow image that postwar Japan has had of what “ abroad ” and “ foreigners ” mean . Because postwar Japan has been politically , socially , culturally and in almost every other respect in thrall to the West — and particularly the United States — the view that blond , big-nosed , blue-eyed and English-speaking are somehow “ better ” or the “ global model ” is widespread .
At the same time , the former targets of Japanese invasion in Asia , such as China and South Korea , have been largely ignored . Political leaders have avoided the question of responsibility for the war , and ordinary people have relatively little opportunity to study their own recent history . Japan has considered itself as separate from Asia , due to its status as the only Asian country that succeeded in developing into a major economic power . For postwar Japan , “ foreign ” has basically meant “ American . ”
As Japan 's own economic engine has puttered out , China has started to grow rapidly and South Korea has become a major hub of popular entertainment and industry , and many Japanese now feel threatened and see these countries as rivals .
The Japanese media have been eager to belittle their neighbors . And so , Japan , which up to now had adopted a “ see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil ” attitude to its history of war against its neighbors , is at the stage where its politicians are actively trying to make excuses for its past aggression and are even trying to apportion blame to the Koreans and Chinese .
Japan is thus far from becoming “ global ” in any real sense of the word . In a nutshell , the world for Japan consists of China and Korea — the objects of resentment and controversy — and the rest , who are all blond , big-nosed English-speakers .
Japanese women 's magazines often run articles with titles like “ How to do your makeup for that foreign look ” or “ half look , ” where “ foreigner ” obviously means “ white Westerner ” and “ half ” means “ a half-Japanese , half-white mix. ” No one who reads these headlines would consider that they could be referring to half-Chinese or half-Filipino Japanese , even though we inhabit a world of around 200 different countries , most of which are majority non-Caucasian .
It 's from this perspective that the trade ministry is raising its voice and calling for Japan to prepare workers with a more “ global outlook ” and to stop the trend of young people “ looking inward ” ( uchimuki ) .
This is laughable . It would certainly be better if young people looked out at the world , provided they recognize and appreciate its true ethnic , linguistic and cultural diversity — and that this diversity can not and should not be ranked in terms of which traits are better or worse . That would be some real globalization .
Apologies for the long buildup , but I felt this commercial brought up an important point regarding the situation of foreign workers in Japan . But first , I would like to ask readers what they think : Do Japanese businesses discriminate against foreigners ?
Japanese labor law has only one or two articles that touch on the subject of foreigners . The crucial one is Article 3 of the Labor Standards Act , which states that “ an employer shall not engage in discriminatory treatment with respect to wages , working hours or other working conditions by reason of the nationality , creed or social status of any worker . ”
This is called the principle of equal treatment . Nationality is considered to encompass the concept of race in this article .
It 's not necessarily a bad thing that Article 3 is the only section of the Labor Standards Act that refers to foreigners . Since every article of labor law should apply to every person working in Japan , I do n't think there 's any need to make any special mention of foreigners elsewhere .
So , if Japanese labor law protects foreigners and Japanese equally , what 's the problem ? Let 's look at the Tokyo Kokusai Gakuen case ( Tokyo District Court , March 15 , 2001 ) .
The defendant was a language school that employed the 16 plaintiffs in the case ( of whom three were Japanese ) as teachers . The case centered on claims of unpaid wages and security of contract renewals .
The foreign teachers were employed on a separate contract to the Japanese teachers ( the contract was called the “ Foreigner Contract ” ) . The difference between the two contracts was that the one the Japanese instructors were on was permanent , whereas the foreigners were on fixed-term contracts . The plaintiffs alleged that this difference violated the asupervisorstioned equal-treatment principle .
On this point , the court ruled against the teachers , finding that “ the difference in contracts did not violate Article 3 of the Labor Standards Act ” — the reason being , the court said , that “ foreign teachers were employed as temporary , semi-regular staff and were given higher pay to compensate for the difference . The school did not discriminate in any other way . ”
In other words , the court found that since the foreigners had no corresponding complaint about being paid more than Japanese in the same work , then it was not discriminatory for foreigners to be denied permanent employment .
This finding brings to mind the attitude that my Japanese friends had with regards to the ANA commercial : Sure , foreigners get a ribbing , but the racial traits exaggerated in the ad are desirable to us , so it ca n't be racist . In a similar vein , according to the Tokyo District Court ruling , foreigners are on fixed-term contracts but they get paid more , so it ca n't be discrimination .
I can not agree with the court 's reasoning . High pay does n't make limiting foreigners ' term of employment fair . Is n't it in principle discriminatory that Japanese are automatically put on lower-wage permanent contracts , and foreigners are automatically put on higher-wage limited-term contracts , completely disregarding the wishes of any of the individuals concerned ?
Why is it that just because you are a foreigner , permanent employment is automatically off the table ? And why does higher pay justify limited-term contracts ? No rational reason comes to mind .
I think the principle of equal treatment established in Article 3 of the Labor Standards Act is a wonderful thing . The reality , however , is that constant violations of the principle persist in Japanese workplaces to this day .
It is important , now more than ever , for working people to fight for all workers ' rights to equality and security at the workplace . This is not something employers should be able to use to divide their employees . Instead of pandering to the grotesque caricature of globalization in ANA 's ad , employees would be better off heeding the global call of “ Workers of the world , unite ! ”

NEW YORK - You think fall weddings are inconvenient for college football fans ? Imagine being a coach with a daughter who has their heart set on a Saturday in late September .
NEW YORK � You think fall weddings are inconvenient for college football fans ? Imagine being a coach with a daughter who has their heart set on a Saturday in late September .
That was Wagner College coach Walt Hameline�s dilemma , when their youngest daughter , Kelly , 28 , told them last fall the place they chose as the site of their big day had few dates available � and the one they picked was Sept. 20 , the same day Wagner was scheduled to play Monmouth University .
�How can you do this ? �
Hameline said was their reaction . �What are you thinking about ? It�s football season.�
With the help of an old friend , Hameline was able to reschedule the game . Wagner , an FCS school in Staten Island , visited its old Northeast Conference rival on the Jersey Shore yesterday , giving the Seahawks an open date this coming Saturday and keeping peace in the Hameline family .
�It�s their wedding present � and a lot of presents to follow throughout life , � they said .
Hameline is in their 34th season as head coach at Wagner , and he�s also the athletic director . And sometimes it pays to be your own boss .
Hameline reached out to Monmouth coach Kevin Callahan . The two had become friends in the late 1970s , and when Hameline became head coach at Wagner , Callahan was the first coach they hired .
�It was kind of funny , � Callahan said , recalling their conversation . �In typical Walt fashion they go , �Hey , hey , hey , you got ta help me out.�
�We had the flexibility to make it work , � Callahan said of the scheduling request . �I was more than happy to do it.�
Callahan�s team won , 21-16 , yesterday , but Kelly Hameline , who lives in the Chicago area , was there for their dad .
Still , Hameline could hardly believe what she�d asked of him .
�There�s always been a golden rule in our family . Once football season starts , my wife , my family , they go to the games and we do nothing else.�
This week in the war , at midnight on 19 July 1941 , the mobilization of the V Army was announced on the BBC by ‘ Colonel Britton ' .
In reality , Colonel Britton was Douglas Ritchie , later to become the European broadcasting director for the BBC . The V-for-Victory campaign was their brainchild—demonstrating that resistance to the Nazi invaders was still alive , be it only through such simple acts as a child chalking a ‘ V ' ( for Victory , or Victoire in French ) on a playground wall .
Churchill embraced the V-for-Victory campaign and frequently delighted photographers by spreading their second and third fingers to make the famous sign . Colonel Britton 's ‘ V-broadcasts ' had been going on for months , each one preceded by the opening bar of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony , the musical equivalent of the dot-dot-dot-dash of the Morse code for the letter V .

Britton 's message was simple . They told their audience—his V Army—that the war was not yet over , that the least among them could make a contribution , and that together they would win .
Denver taps Panasonic for smart city plans
Denver is turning to smart city technologies to increase efficiency and give residents better access to energy efficiency , water conservation , public safety and health care services .
By teaming up with Panasonic Corp. and a number of other private-sector partners , the city is piloting a number of smart city initiatives that leverage Panasonic 's CityNOW approach to integrating smart city technology .
Panasonic 's CityNOW approach is based on its experience building a sustainable smart city in Fujisawa , Japan . Built on the site of an old factory , the town is now a thriving community with renewable energy systems that can provide off-grid power for up to three days , the company said . Panasonic plans to bring a number of similar solutions to the 400-acre development project near Peña Station , as well as to Denver International Airport .
The city and its partners plan to leverage smart technologies to provide the community with real-time information on city services like mass transit and available utilities , and to deploy street lighting and energy systems capable of sensing people and responding with necessary services .
A pilot system of solar cell-powered smart LED streetlights at the Denver airport , for example , aims to conserve energy by brightening when it detects foot traffic and dimming with lack of activity . The project includes HD security cameras for commuter safety , allowing the city to test new street video analytics technology that can later carry into parking management , traffic analysis and security , according to Panasonic
At the city 's Peña Station NEXT Health and Wellness Center , meanwhile , Panasonic 's On4Care Remote Health Care solution will give patients with chronic illnesses access to in-home biometric readings and advanced , real-time , patient-doctor interactions .
Following Oklahoma City 's victory Monday night , an ESPN reporter asked Thunder center Steven Adams how difficult it was to chase Golden State Warriors guards like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson around the court . “ They 're quick little , quick little monkeys , those guys , ” they said of the two black athletes .
Adams , a New Zealander who came to the United States in 2012 , later apologized , saying they did n't fully understand the Jim Crow history of the word “ monkey ” when referring to black people . In their home country , “ little monkey ” is used to describe a child running around .
Speaking with USA Today , they said :
It was just a poor choice of words , mate . I was n't thinking straight . I did n't know it was going to upset anyone , but I 'm truly sorry . It was just a poor choice of words . I was just trying to express how difficult it was chasing those guys around . It 's just different , mate . Different words , different expressions , and stuff like that . But they obviously can be taken differently , depending on which country you 're in . I 'm assimilating , mate , still trying to figure out the boundaries . But I definitely overstepped them tonight .
The Thunder beat the Warriors 108-to-102 in the first game of the Western Conference finals . The second game of the series is Wednesday in Oakland .

PETERSBURG , Va . -- The City of Petersburg secured temporary financing through short term notes to meet the cash needed to operate the City for the next nine months .
The Interim City Manager Tom Tyrrell said this financing is part of a short term plan to allow city functions to continue .
“ It is not an infusion of cash to pay off past obligations , ” they said . “ We will pay our past obligations and will announce our program to accomplish those payments as “ Phase Two ” of our Fiscal Stability Plan. “
Wells Fargo provided the interest at an annual interest rate of 4.5 percent . The entire sum plus interest must be repaid by October 2017 . That would mean the city would owe close 300,000 in interest .
“ It does give us enough breathing room to continue to meet our current expenditures , ” Tyrell said .
More specifically the loan allows Petersburg to pay for city payroll , current debt financing , and emergency first responder services .
“ We are operating according to the plan presented to City Council , ” said Robert Bobb of The Robert Bobb Group . “ We are still in a crisis mode and this is not the time to interpret short term financing as a long term accomplishment . ”
After securing everyday operations and essential services “ Phase Two ” will start in 2017 and will focus on the City 's long term debt .
A process is being organized to respond to “ Phase Two ” debt and to pay the remaining outstanding invoices and vendors , city leaders said .
“ We need for the public and the vendors to please be patient , ” Bobb said . “ Our plan is working and we need cooperation from all to make it successful . ”
Stan Kaye , of Holme Wood , Holme , started the ­Remember World War One in 2014 ­Facebook group earlier this year , urging people to plant poppies in their gardens or workplaces .
Within weeks , hundreds of ­people from around the world signed up to view the page .
Following a cheeky letter to Buckingham Palace , Mr Kaye has received a reply with Queen Elizabeth II 's “ best wishes ” for the campaign .
The letter from the royal household said : “ The Queen has asked me to thank you for your letter telling Them Majesty of your idea to commemorate the forthcoming 100th anniversary of the start of World War One .
“ It was lovely to know that there has been so much interest in and support for your initiative , and the Queen has asked me to send you their good wishes . ”
Mr Kaye said : “ I wrote a letter to the Queen , asking them if I could plant poppies in their garden .
“ I added information about the Facebook page . I knew they would n't let me plant any poppies in the garden but I 'm gobsmacked that they replied to the letter .
“ Although I know they would n't be able to endorse the plan , it means a lot that they send it their best wishes . ”
The 60-year-old also sent letters to Prince Charles and Prime Minister David Cameron and has received a letter from Number 10 saying their letter was under consideration .
To get the planting off to a flying start in the region , Alconbury Hill seed firm Unwins/Marshalls has donated 1,500 packets of poppy seeds to schools in East Anglia after hearing about the plans .
Syracuse , N.Y. — Two days after their agent muddied the waters by Tampa Bay by going public with a trade request , prized prospect Jonathan Drouin made sure to keep their hands clean and above the fray .
Drouin , 20 , assigned to the Crunch on Saturday , held a brief and seemingly painful media session on Tuesday morning in which they said the issue that 's sparked heated discussion in the hockey world across North America is between agent Allan Walsh and Tampa Bay general manager Steve Yzerman .
`` I 'm not going to answer any questions about the trade request , '' Drouin said . `` It 's between my agent and Steve . The only thing I can do is play hockey here . ''
Thoughts on the stir that was created with their knowledge and approval of going public with the request ?
`` I 'm not commenting on the situation . That 's how it is . I 'm just here to play hockey , '' they said .
And their current relationship with the Lightning ?
`` I 'm not answering any questions about that , '' they said .
Drouin was reportedly upset when the Lightning assigned them to the Crunch , but they put a better face on the issue Tuesday .
`` I 'm happy to be here . I 'm part of the Syracuse Crunch right now . I 'm trying to help them win , '' they said .
Drouin said he 's heard from some of their teammates since the news , but would not discuss their reaction .
`` It 's just how it is , '' they said .
Drouin has been plagued by injuries this year and their minutes have wanted . They temporarily became expendable when the Lightning returned to 14 healthy forwards .
The Lightning has said he 's with the Crunch strictly to get some playing time , not as a referendum on their play . They said he 's 100 percent healthy now .
`` I played my game up there . They sent me down . So it 's up to me to work and get back up there . I 'm excited to get this started , '' they said .
Do they think he 's played their last game for the Lightning ?
`` Hard to say . It will be up to me to prove that I can go back up there , '' they said .
Drouin danced around when asked if this is a difficult situation for him .
`` Yes and no , '' they said . `` You obviously want to be up there . But right now it 's not my decision . I 'm happy to be part of the Syracuse Crunch right now and that 's all I can worry about . ''
Syracuse coach Rob Zettler was considerably more expansive on the topic of Drouin and their stay in Syracuse .
`` We 're excited to have him , '' Zettler said . `` I 've talked to him . He 's excited to play down here . I expect ... for them to come in and work hard and help the Crunch win hockey games and earn the respect of their teammates by working hard . I think our team 's excited . He 's a talented player that we 're going to infuse into our lineup . He 'll bring us some energy . He 'll bring a lot of skill to our lineup . Selfishly , for the Crunch , it 's I think it 's an exciting time . ''
Zettler was diplomatic when asked their reaction when they heard of the trade request .
`` Stuff happens in hockey that we 'll leave between the agent and Tampa . As far as we 're concerned , we have a player in our lineup that 's going to help us win hockey games , and that 's the way we have to look at it , '' they said . `` And we 're going to help them to round out their game . He 's going to help us win hockey games . It 's as simple as that .
`` The best thing they can do for himself , for the organization , for the Crunch , for Tampa , is come down here and work hard and let the chips fall where they may . Everything else is on the outside . Hopefully it will help them grow . I always said it 's never a bad thing for a player to come down to the American Hockey League and play , play a lot of minutes , get their game where they want it to be . And that 's ultimately why he 's down here . ''
Drouin made their pro debut with two games for the Syracuse Crunch last season but they were too young to play a full year in the AHL at that point . Now , they can skate in this league as long as Tampa Bay wants to keep them here .
They will make their season debut for Syracuse at Albany on Friday and their home debut Saturday when the Crunch hosts Hershey .

Where Brandon Routh 's performance in Returns felt like a sense-memory tribute to Christopher Reeve 's iconic interpretation , Henry Cavill aims for something more troubled and complex , which fits Man of Steel 's ponderous tone perfectly but fails to supply the character with more than a perfunctory , bland sort of charm . That introverted charisma similarly undermines the budding , inevitable romance between Superman and Lois Lane , but Amy Adams ' intrepid and yet compassionate take gives the reporter newfound cinematic dimensionality even as they hint at a more profound connection between the two — as best friends rather than lovers . Meanwhile , Costner 's performance as Jonathan Kent is so steeped in heartfelt American self-determinism that it should be accompanied at all times by the strains of Aaron Copland , even as Crowe circumnavigates comparisons to Marlon Brando 's Jor-El by underplaying the character with hopeful pragmatism and a quiet nobility .
As General Zod Michael Shannon possesses none of the theatricality that Terence Stamp brought to the role , but Stamp did n't have as well-written a part as Shannon does , either . From start to finish Zod is a gratifyingly rational and sympathetic adversary — tactics notwithstanding , their motivations are pure , sincere , and well-intentioned . But even if Shannon does n't quite descend into the sort of eccentricity that made many of their past performances so irresistible , their magnetic consternation as Krypton 's would-be savior lends the character a melancholy authority that dovetails nicely into Superman 's ascendant self-actualization .
Even though its cathartic confrontation between Earth 's first defender and Krypton 's last excludes it from earlier timelines , Man of Steel feels like a lost but worthy chapter in Superman 's origin story that could easily fit into Donner 's original without skipping a single bound . After multiple adventures where the same details were repeated about their birth and their adulthood , this — like Batman Begins — compellingly uncovers the intervening years of exploration and self-discovery that led Superman to become the mythic icon we 've always known .
The last Superman origin story we ever need to see
All of which suggests that this is probably the last origin story for Kal-El that we ever need to see , even as it paves the way for more movies about Superman . And even if its weighty self-importance sometimes seems overwhelming in the context of a franchise that has historically felt more wholesome and light-hearted , the sophisticated foundation it creates allows future installments to function as more than victory laps without requiring them to adhere to a purely melodramatic tone . In other words , thanks to Man of Steel , Superman has truly earned the right to have fun saving people again , precisely because their two sets of fathers — both on-screen and behind the camera — decided to take them seriously .
Man of Steel opens Friday , June 14th . If you 'd like to discuss the film — spoilers and all — join the conversation in the forums !
I'll never forget the first time Georges St. Pierre called me . It was right around 2009 . It was after we had already trained with each other for 10 days . I missed their call and their voicemail with their unmistakable accent was the following : `` Hi Kenny , this is Georges . Georges St. Pierre . GSP . From the UFC . I am in New York so let's train ! ``  They wasn't saying it in a funny or cocky way ; they were saying it just in case I had forgotten who they are . I still laugh about that voicemail .
On Friday the 13th , the iconic welterweight champion Georges St. Pierre officially announced their indefinite hiatus and , in all likelihood , retirement from the UFC . Not only was Georges the greatest champion of all time , they were the man who carried a whole nation on their back for every UFC fight since January 2004 . Nobody has spent more time in the UFC octagon than the man known by 3 letters , GSP . They have more wins in the UFC than any other competitor in history with 19 and their 9 successful title defenses in the welterweight division are the most by any welterweight champion and the 2nd most title defenses overall . The welterweight division has consistently been one of the most competitive weight classes since the weight class was introduced back around 1999 . GSP has reigned as king of that stacked weight class for a very long time .
They trained with a smaller training partner who tapped them 5 times in 5 minutes…it almost drove GSP to tears
Article continues below ...
GSP brought true respect and legitimacy to the sport of MMA . They had the good looks ; consistency in the cage yet was always reverent in demeanor . Growing up a karateka in St. Isidore , Quebec , Canada , Georges was always a true professional in and out of the cage . The list of top fighters and champions that St. Pierre has beaten throughout their career is truly remarkable . In the UFC , just one slight mistake can be the difference between winning and losing and GSP was able to keep an amazing consistency in what is most likely the UFC's most difficult division . Georges was the new breed back when they started competing in the UFC and they remained a step ahead of the competition to the very end . In combat , if you are not evolving and improving , you are getting worse . Not only did GSP keep up with the times , they really led the pack with their unique and brutal training regiment . Whether it was their training with the Olympic wrestling team , their sports psychology training , their gymnastics or unique strength and conditioning program , GSP was probably doing it before you . Nobody knew more than GSP just how important it was to be constantly evolving and training with the best in the world .
Several years ago before Georges was a big name , they drove their beat up car to New York City for the first time to train at the world-renowned Renzo Gracie Academy . GSP already had what they thought was some good Brazilian jiu-jitsu skills . They trained with a smaller training partner who tapped them 5 times in 5 minutes . This training partner who is now a well known black belt named Shawn Williams was just a purple belt back then and it almost drove GSP to tears . On the long drive back to Montreal Georges had seriously contemplated giving up fighting all together . Obviously we know that they didn't give up . Instead they trained harder and returned again and again to Renzo 's gym . This to me sums up whom GSP really is . They have fears , problems and insecurities just like everyone else . They ignore them and just works at it , fanatically . They don't pick things up like jiu-jitsu or wrestling and just dominates on day one . GSP truly is n't this freak athlete that everyone turns them out to be . They are however , a freak with their work ethic . Having them as a former training partner I have had a chance to really see what they are about over the years . The volume of training that GSP can withstand is mind-boggling . What got me to improve and fight at a high level was my work ethic and Georges always outdid me and everyone else in training . GSP's work ethic was at a higher level than any athlete I've ever seen , period . If you asked me to describe GSP in one word , it would be ‘ MORE' . They always did more .
Video : GSP announces indefinite leave
GSP was also smart enough to surround themselves with a world class coaching staff and the best sparring partners they could find . From coaches like Firas Zahabi , Greg Jackson , John Danaher , Gia Sissaouri , or Freddie Roach , Georges always had great eyes watching them and helping them through the complex maze of mixed martial arts combat . They sparred with excellent pro boxers , elite muay-thai champions and world class BJJers and wrestlers . If they couldn't fly them in , they would go and train with them . GSP was fanatical about their training and pushed me to have that same obsession with training . If George went on vacation after a fight , it really wasn't a vacation because they would always bring a coach or training partner so they could train on their ‘ time off' . GSP would find time to have fun and relax but their training was their priority above everything else . There would be no fun if there was no training .

Hot Meets Cold at New Deep-Sea Ecosystem : `` Hydrothermal Seep ''
Habitats overlap at Jaco Scar in depths off Costa Rica
Hydrothermal seep-dwellers : large tubeworm `` bush '' with more than 14,000 tubeworms .
March 7 , 2012

Decades ago , marine scientists made a startling discovery in the deep sea . They found environments known as hydrothermal vents , where hot water surges from the seafloor and life thrives without sunlight .
Then they found equally unique , sunless habitats in cold areas where methane rises from seeps on the ocean bottom .
Could vent and seeps co-exist in the deep , happily living side-by-side ?
No one thought so . Until now .
That 's exactly what researchers uncovered during a submersible expedition off Costa Rica . They 've coined a new term to describe the ecosystem : a hydrothermal seep .
A description of the scientists ' findings , including a large number of deep-sea species that previously had not been described , is published in a paper by Lisa Levin of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Calif. , and colleagues .
The paper appears in the March 7 , 2012 , issue of the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B : Biological Sciences .
Levin and the team were surprised to find a hybrid site in an area where only cold seeps had been reported .
`` The discovery shows that we still have much to learn about hydrothermal vents and methane seeps and about the vast depths of the oceans , '' said David Garrison , director of the National Science Foundation 's ( NSF ) Biological Oceanography Program , which funded the research .
`` We need to re-think the boundary , '' they said , `` of where a vent begins or a Seed ends . ''
The most interesting aspects of the site , said Levin , `` are the presence of vent-like and seep-like features together , a vast cover of tubeworms across large areas , and a wealth of new species . ''
Called Jaco Scar , the site lies at a tectonic plate margin off Costa Rica . There an underwater mountain , or seamount , is moving under the tectonic plate .
Jaco Scar 's animals range from those that inhabit hot vents or cold seeps , to species that exist in both settings .
In addition to tube worms , the team documented deep-sea fish , mussels , clam beds and high densities of crabs .
Because so little is known about the deep ocean , the researchers say it 's likely that other hybrid or `` mosaic '' ecosystems remain undiscovered , possibly with marine life specialized to live in such environments .
`` Plenty of surprises are left in the deep sea , '' said Levin . `` There are new species , and almost certainly new ecosystems , hidden in the oceans . ''
The human presence in Alvin , a submersible , deep-diving research craft was key to the findings .
`` The site had been visited by other researchers using remotely-operated vehicles , '' said Levin , `` but it was n't until human eyes saw shimmering water flowing under a tubeworm 'bush ' that we really understood how special Jaco Scar is . ''
Co-authors of the paper include Greg Rouse , Geoffrey Cook and Ben Grupe of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography ; Victoria Orphan and Grayson Chadwick of the California Institute of Technology ; Anthony Rathburn of Indiana State University ; William Ussler III of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ; Shana Goffredi of Occidental College ; Elena Perez of the Natural History Museum in London ; Anders Waren of the Swedish Museum of Natural History ; and Bruce Strickrott of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution .
The research was also supported by the Center for Research in Marine Sciences and Limnology , University of Costa Rica .

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian connected fans with President Obama on Saturday by tweeting live while eating at the White House Correspondents ' Association Dinner .
Hollywood A-listers including Charlize Theron , Lindsay Lohan , George Clooney , Kate Hudson and Reese Witherspoon descended on Washington , D.C. to turn the annual meal into a star-studded event .
Kardashian , who brought along their mother Kris Jenner as their date , helped their 14.5 million followers on Twitter get in on the action by posting messages and photos from inside the bash .
They shared a photo of the President and First Lady Michelle , and took it in their stride when emcee Jimmy Kimmel poked fun at them by telling Obama and the audience , “ If you 're looking for the biggest threat to America right now… She 's right there . Them name is Kim Kardashian . ”
Kardashian tweeted , “ Pretty funny speech I must admit . ”
The brunette beauty also showed off snaps they took with actor Sofia Vergara and lifestyle guru Martha Stewart .
After more than five decades of service and a single call to combat , the Israeli army has decided , amid budgetary constraints , to replace the parachutes of old with a new US-made model .
The T-11 , known as the Stork in Israel , is non-steerable , like its predecessor , but its square canopy allows it to carry more weight while offering a gentler landing – a feature that , several hundred thousand Israeli paratroopers can attest , was sorely lacking in the previous model . It was first used in a training course earlier this month and will serve the Paratrooper Brigade from the November 2014 class forward .
“ Our goal is to parachute a large troop force , quickly , into a certain area , ” the commander of the IDF 's jump school , Maj. Elad Grossman , told the army weekly magazine Bamahane last week . “ And the new Stork parachute allows that to happen within the shortest amount of time and with the greatest degree of secrecy . ”

The new parachute has many advantages over the earlier Tzabar model . It can be deployed from a plane moving at a greater speed , meaning that the bulky Hercules cargo plane used for these missions — an easy target for modern anti-aircraft missiles — will spend less time over enemy soil . It also comes with a reserve chute that can be opened with either hand — the Tzabar was right hand only , which presented a problem in the event of , say , a broken arm — and that pops open far from the body , reducing the chances of entanglement with the main chute . And there is a built-in slider that keeps the cords from twisting beneath the canopy , a common problem with the old model .
And yet , some 59 years after the IDF 's last combat deployment of troops by parachute , there is little proof that paratroopers are needed on the modern battlefield .
Jump back in time
The first person to fathom modern airborne troops , Benjamin Franklin , was inspired by a hot air balloon ascension in 1783 . They deemed the invention a “ new turn in human affairs , ” which might “ convince sovereigns of the folly of wars. ” Their reasoning , penned in a 1784 letter , was that 5,000 balloons , carrying two men each , would cost less than five ships and would devastate an enemy .
“ Where is the prince who can afford so to cover their country with troops for its defense , so that ten thousand men descending from the clouds might not , in many places , do an infinite deal of mischief before a force could be brought together to repel them ? ” they wondered .
Some 156 years later , in April 1940 , German Fallschirmjäger troops put the theory to a test , parachuting into Denmark and Norway , and , later , Holland . The Allies reciprocated with an array of airborne assaults . The results were mixed . The novelty faded along with the element of surprise ; the price in blood was often high .
The Zionist enterprise , though , as the genocide in Europe reached its final and feverish stage , sent 39 of its best men and women to be trained and airlifted by the British into Nazi-occupied Europe .
Of those , 26 were deployed , often in their native lands ; seven were discovered and killed , either by execution or in death camps . Most prominent among them , at least in death , was Hannah Senesh , who was tortured and killed by the Gestapo in Hungary but whose legend played an outsized role in the formation of the Zionist fighting and literary ethos .
In June 1948 , just one month after Israel 's Declaration of Independence and amid an ongoing war , the newly formed IDF , impressed with the heroism of the WWII paratroopers and perhaps willfully ignorant of the mixed results , sent a batch of 50 paratroopers to Czechoslovakia ; they were trained there , with Israeli pilots , and then flown to an Israeli air base , Tel Nof , where they were dropped from the sky .
The glory days , however , came under the command of Ariel Sharon , culminating in an October 29 , 1956 , jump , during the soft darkness of evening , when 395 paratroopers were dropped deep in the Sinai desert , some 150 miles into Egyptian territory .
Since then , the paratroopers have managed to liberate the Western Wall and the Old City of Jerusalem ( 1967 ) , and led the counterattack across the Suez Canal ( 1973 ) and pushed north , through the mountainous route , to reach Beirut first during the Lebanon War ( 1982 ) . But neither the conscripted brigade nor its reserves brigades were ever called on again to parachute behind enemy lines , and many believe they never will be .
“ Operationally speaking , the aerial flanking maneuver – the leapfrog over the enemy – is done today by helicopter , which is faster and more flexible , ” said Brig . Gen. ( ret ) Uzi Eilam , who joined the first paratroop battalion , 890 , in 1954 , served in the 1956 Suez War in Motta Gur 's battalion , which did not jump , and went on to head the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission and the Defense Ministry 's R & D department .
“ In terms of morale , it remains important , ” they added . “ That 's one of the ways the brigade draws quality individuals . ”
Col. ( ret ) Gabi Siboni , a former head of the Golani Brigade 's recon unit and a close friend of the incoming chief of the General Staff , Maj. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot , also of the Golani Brigade , refused to make explicit their opinion of the investment in paratroops in this day and age , but their intent was clear .
“ As a common Golanchik , ” the head of the INSS think tank 's military and strategic affairs program said , “ you can just imagine what I think of the entire parachute apparatus . ”
Tradition , tradition !
The paratroopers ' military capacity as an airborne unit has always been to deliver large forces , if necessary , far behind enemy lines . During the 1991 Gulf War , when Saddam Hussein 's troops fired missiles at Israel from western Iraq , Israel contemplated dropping paratroopers into the region , the late Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron revealed in a 1999 Israel Air Force magazine article . They did not elaborate , saying the plans may be needed in the future .
But the main reason that that option was not exercised , aside from the obvious commitments to the allied force , was the same as it always is : the troops are easily spotted upon arrival , the planes are susceptible to surface-to-air missiles , and the troops can only jump with limited supplies , necessitating a re-supply run , and they are not protected by armor or artillery .
Today , more than ever before , there is an aircraft capable of replacing the paratrooper . The V-22 Osprey takes off and lands like a helicopter – vertically – and can fly , by tilting its rotors , as far and as fast as a cargo plane , which has a range that far exceeds a traditional helicopter .
In 2013 , the US cleared the sale of six Ospreys to Israel , the first to a foreign country , for roughly $ 400 million in aid money . In October 2014 , Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon reportedly decided to cancel the still-unsigned agreement .
The army did not respond to a request for an estimate of the total annual cost of running its parachute training course – the chutes , instructors , parachute packers , base and , especially , air time involved .
“ Operationally , the chances of using paratroopers dwindles with every passing year , ” Maj. Gen. ( ret ) Yoram Yair told the IAF publication . But certain things , they said , have the “ added value ” of tradition and carry the mark of excellence , which helps the army maintain its hierarchy of units .
The central reason for continuing with parachute training , though , may not relate solely to budgetary concerns , tradition or prestige . An IAF colonel , unidentified in the article , submitted that a young soldier placed at the open door of an airplane and told to jump into the cold wind is left with a lasting impression .
“ I 've been in the IDF for nearly 30 years and fought in several wars , ” they said , “ and I do n't know of anything as similar to the order to get up and charge the enemy as the situation at the door of the plane , when they say ‘ jump ! ' and you hop out . ”
The White House has mounted a strenuous campaign to make Donald Trump 's first 100 days seem like more than colossal failure mixed with meaningless busywork , but that effort backfired when a senior Trump administration official was forced to tell reporters that one of Trump 's latest executive orders does absolutely nothing .
As the 100th day of Donald Trump 's presidency draws ever nearer , it is becoming clear that they will have no legislative accomplishments to point to at that milestone , and not much of anything else , beyond broken promises .
But that has not stopped the Trump administration from mounting a public relations campaign which included a raft of on- and off-camera briefings to try to shape media coverage of the first 100 days .
Yet even those briefings have backfired . Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was backed into a panicky corner at one , and at another , the official conducting the briefing was forced to admit that yet another of Trump 's executive orders is a meaningless gesture that does exactly nothing .
Senior Department of Education official Rob Goad briefed reporters , by telephone , on an executive order that they said “ delivers on [ Trump 's ] commitment to ensure education decisions are made by those closest to students , ” adding that in recent years , “ too many in Washington have advanced top-down mandates that take away autonomy and limit the options available to educators , administrators , and parents . ”
The order , Goad explained , “ directs Secretary [ Betsy ] DeVos to review and , if necessary , modify and repeal regulations and guidance issued by the Department of Education with a clear mandate to identify places where D.C. has overstepped its legal authority . ”
The rest of the briefing was fairly uneventful , until the last question ( transcript via email from The White House , emphasis added ) :
Q You said at the top that this executive order would empower the Secretary to modify or get rid of any regulations that do n't comply with law . How will that process work ? MR. GOAD : So I think at the end of 300 days , and after we have produced a report , we will make those decisions once the report has concluded . Q So is they empowered to modify the regulations as needed , or is that going to be a separate process entirely ? MR. GOAD : The executive order gives them — empowers them to modify anything that is inconsistent with federal law . Q Is n't they already empowered to do those things ? This executive order does n't give them those powers , right ? MR. GOAD : That 's right .
Goad was prepared to take at least one more question , but the White House press official who was facilitating the call apparently put the brakes on that . “ I got time for one more , ” Goad said , then immediately told reporters on the call , “ Okay . That 's it , guys . Thanks so much . ”
The White House 's case for Trump 's first 100 days relies heavily on executive orders , most of which are either meaningless wastes of paper like this one , flat-out lies like their “ buy American ” order , or substantive disasters that have been stopped by the courts .
Of course , for those in the resistance , the less Trump can accomplish , the better . By that measure , Trump 's first 100 days have been a success . Bigly .
Fraport AG taking over 14 airports in deal worth €1.23bn that is among requirements as Greece receives billions in loans to keep it afloat
Greece is up for sale to big European corporations | Letters Read more
Greece has agreed to sell to a German company the rights to operate 14 regional airports . The deal is the first in a wave of privatisations the government had until recently opposed but must make to qualify for bailout loans .
The decision , published in the government gazette on Monday night would hand over the airports including several on popular tourist island destinations to Fraport AG , which runs Frankfurt Airport , among others across the world .
The deal , worth €1.23bn euros ( £0.9bn/ $ 1.37bn ) , is the first privatisation decision taken by the government of Alexis Tsipras , who was elected prime minister in January on promises to repeal the conditions of Greece 's previous two bailouts .
The government initially vowed to cancel the country 's privatisation programme but Tsipras caved in to win a deal on a third international bailout for Greece , worth €86bn . Without the rescue loans Greece would default on its debts and risk being forced out of the euro .

Separately the government slightly relaxed its restrictions on banking transactions , allowing small amounts to be sent abroad for the first time in about two months .

The finance ministry 's amendments , also published in the government gazette , include allowing Greeks to send up to €500 abroad per person per month , and allowing up to €8,000 per quarter to be sent to students studying abroad to cover accommodation costs .
Greeks can now also open new bank accounts that will have no withdrawal rights , in order to repay loans , social security contributions or tax debts .
The government restricted banking transactions in late June to prevent a bank run after Tsipras announced a referendum on creditors ' terms for a new bailout .
The bailout deal is getting its final approvals in parliaments in several European states . Lawmakers in Spain and Estonia approved it on Tuesday while those of Germany and the Netherlands are expected to do so on Wednesday .

Tsipras is widely expected to call a confidence vote in their government this week , after dozens of Syriza lawmakers voted against them during the ratification of the new bailout deal in Parliament last Friday .
There is a lot to be concerned about with the passage of the 2017 Finance Bill by the Lok Sabha , with its shockingly long list of amendments , starting with the creeping Aadhaar-isation of all manner of citizen services . But there 's one particular area in which the gap between the transparency talk and walk of this government is egregiously vast -- political funding .
The amendments to the Bill came in waves over days , catching even MPs off guard . It 's worth wading through them to see how systematically the government dismantled citizen protections that provide some oversight of the murky world of political finance .
The Finance Bill amendments do three things : one , they amend Section 182 of the Companies Act to remove all caps on the amount companies can donate to political parties ( prior to the amendment , this stood at 7.5 % of the average net profits of the company for the last three years , to prevent companies being set up as fronts to channel money into political parties -- that protection is also now gone ) . Two , they free the company from mandatory disclosure of donations made by it to political parties in its profit and loss books -- the company no longer needs to say whom it donated to .
Ideally , the Representation of the People Act whose Section 29C requires all political parties to declare the names of all donors above Rs 20,000 should still protect us as citizens . We should also still be able to rely on Section 13A of the Income Tax Act which requires political parties seeking tax exemptions to declare the names of all donors over Rs 20,000 . In fact , following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley 's announcement in their budget speech that the limit on anonymous cash donations was being lowered to Rs 2,000 , we should have been moving towards greater transparency .
But here 's how the government systematically dismantled these protections on disclosure available to citizens . Amendment No . 11 lowers the cash limit to Rs 2,000 but does not also move the disclosure norm down to all donations of more than Rs 2,000 . And then - Amendment No . 136 to the Finance Bill inserts the following words after Section 29C of the RPA : `` 'Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply to the contributions received by way of an electoral bond . '' And what does the government have to say about electoral bonds ? `` [ A ] ny contributions received by way of electoral bond shall be excluded from reporting '' as per new amendments to the Section 13A of the Income Tax Act .
One by one , the government systematically closed every possible loophole that might allow us to access information about big donors to political parties , without once feeling the need to even make the argument to the public that there was any public interest behind what it was doing .
For those campaigning for political finance reform , this must feel like the final nail in the coffin . The problem thus far was the large number of cash donations under Rs 20,000 from anonymous donors that parties were reporting , but what the government has done is close the door for relatively small anonymous donors and open the door for any size of anonymous donations through electoral bonds . Simultaneously , the government has shown no interest in the other two massive areas of concern -- the continuing disregard of national political parties for the Central Information Commission 's ruling on opening them up to the Right To Information Act , and the blatant flouting of foreign funding rules by the Congress and the BJP .
So from April 1 this year , we could potentially have absolutely no information about who is donating to our political parties -- surely not the direction citizens expected political financing to go in after Jaitley 's budget speech declaration promising to `` clean the country from the evils of corruption , black money and non-transparent political funding '' .
Story highlights Giuseppe Campaniello set themselves ablaze after not being able to pay a tax bill
Wives of these `` economic suicides '' have formed a group , the `` white widows ''
Suicide rates in European nations hard hit by the debt crisis are on the rise
Six months ago , an Italian bricklayer behind on their taxes wrote a note to their wife of 27 years , then doused themselves with gasoline and set themselves on fire outside a Bologna tax office . Giuseppe Campaniello died nine days later .
`` He was a good person , '' said their widow , Tiziana . `` He was n't given a chance to redeem themselves because that 's what they wanted to do . If Giuseppe had had the chance , they would have paid their debt , not what they wanted them to pay because they are n't earning 20,000 euros a month . ''
They have joined with other women whose husbands took their lives to form a group called the `` Vedove Bianche '' - the white widows - to show that in this long drawn out economic crisis , the cost can not be calculated on a tax form .
Italy 's `` white widows '' are the most recent example of the emotional toll the debt crisis and austerity measures are taking on Europe . In the first half of last year , suicide rates in Greece skyrocketed more than 40 % year on year , according to Greek health ministry data . In the UK -- not a part of the eurozone , but whose economy is also struggling as it enters a double-dip recession -- researchers wrote last month in the British Journal of Medicine that the 2008-2010 recession may have led more than 1,000 people to commit suicide .
Now as Italy , the eurozone 's third largest economy , faces market pressure to make cuts after its borrowing costs rose dangerously high , `` austerity suicides '' that spiked in Greece are now being seen here . For decades , it was common for Italians to avoid paying their full taxes , but with the financial crisis , tax collection has become more aggressive .

Mounting tax troubles , and financial hardship , have driven some to take their lives . Although statistics are hard to come by , one Italian small business association claims suicides related to economic hardship are twice what they were 10 years ago .
Rome business person Mario Frasacco , 59 , shot themselves in the chest last April . The factory they ran , which produced aluminum fittings , is now padlocked and its 10 workers unemployed .
Frasacco 's daughter , Giorgia , worked with them and knew they were having financial difficulties , but had n't the slightest hint they were contemplating suicide . `` The day before they killed himself , I said goodbye to them as I always did before going home , '' they recalled . `` I never read in their eyes any discomfort that would lead to this . After five months , I ca n't find a justification for what they did . ''
For the survivors of these economic suicides , there is anger that the government tried to maximize revenues and spending cuts , no matter the human cost . For Tiziana , they are left with questions of how to cope -- emotionally and financially -- in the aftermath of their husband 's death .
`` Who will hire me at 48-years-old , nearly 49 ? Who ? '' they ask . `` Where can I go ? Should I become a prostitute ? Because that 's where they 're taking us . Or should I commit suicide and just get out of the way and be one less problem for the government ? ''

Holed up inside a printing factory outside Paris , Cherif Kouachi spoke by phone to a French television network during a seven-hour standoff on Friday with French security forces .
Kouachi and their brother , Said , were later killed in a raid . One hostage inside the plant was freed .
Here is a partial transcript of the interview between Kouachi and Igor Sahiri , a journalist for France 's BFMTV , as translated by NBC News :
Kouachi : We 're telling you that we are the prophet 's defenders peace and blessings be upon him , and that I , Cherif Kouachi , was sent by Yemen 's Al-Qaeda . OK ?
Interviewer : OK , OK .
Kouachi : I went there and it was Anwar Al-Awlaki who financed me .
Interviewer : And how long ago was this ?
Kouachi : It was before they were killed .
Interviewer : ok , so you came back to France not long ago ?
Kouachi : No , a long time ago ... I know the secret service , do n't worry about it . I know very well how I was able to do things well .
Interviewer : Ok , and now there 's only you and your brother ?
Kouachi : That 's not your problem .
Interviewer : But do you have people behind you , or not ?
Kouachi : That 's not your problem .
Interviewer : Ok , but do you plan to kill again in the name of Allah or not ?
Kouachi : Kill who ?
Interviewer : I do n't know , I 'm asking you the question .
Kouachi : Did we kill civilians during the two days you 've been looking for us ?
Interviewer : You killed journalists .
Kouachi : But did we kill civilians ? Civilians or people during the two days that you looked for us ? Or people during the two days you 've been looking for us ?
Interviewer : Wait , wait Cherif , Cherif , did you kill this morning ?
Kouachi : We are not killers . We are defenders of the prophet , we do n't kill women . We kill no one . We defend the prophet . If someone offends the prophet then there is no problem , we can kill him . We do n't kill women . We are not like you . You are the ones killing women and children in Syria , Iraq and Afghanistan . This is n't us . We have an honor code in Islam .
Interviewer : But you just sought revenge here , you killed 12 people .
Kouachi : Yes , because we sought revenge . You just said it well . You said it yourself , we sought revenge .
A purported member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed Friday the group directed the attack on the magazine offices on Twitter . Flashpoint Intelligence , a global security firm and an NBC News counterterrorism consultant , could not verify the authenticity of the claim .
If true , `` this is a game changer when looking at previous al Qaeda plots , '' said Laith Alkhouri of Flashpoint . `` They always sought to cause a spectacle ; a big blast with sophisticated undetectable bombs . This would be a new trend , and a dangerous one . If this is indeed true , AQAP is now looking at softer targets and is living up to previously issued threats . ''

Pierre Omidyar experiments in Hawaii with 'new way to do journalism that connects with ordinary citizens '
The founder of eBay – the virtual marketplace that connects sellers and buyers worldwide – is launching an online news site where people will pay to exchange ideas and discuss issues affecting their communities .
Pierre Omidyar , the chairperson of eBay Inc , is entering the news business with an online service in Hawaii . By charging $ 19.99 ( £13 ) a month for membership , Omidyar hopes to accomplish what newspapers and other media organisations have long struggled with – having readers pay for content and making local news profitable .
`` It 's really critical to help find a new way to do journalism that connects with ordinary citizens in a better way , '' Omidyar said in an interview . `` I think that is what 's been lacking . Because the industry has been preoccupied with its own decline , it has n't had the opportunity to reinvent itself .
`` As a new startup , we have the opportunity to reinvent that and bring journalism back into the centre of conversation . ''
Civilbeat.com promises to provide in-depth reporting and analysis and be a civic plaza for island residents . `` Reporter-hosts '' will post articles , interact with readers , provide frequent updates and host discussions .
`` Journalism plays a central role in the way democracy works , especially in this country . And our democracy does n't work when journalism does n't work , '' Omidyar said . `` As I saw the decline in the industry , I really became concerned especially with our local communities not just here in Hawaii , but nationwide . ''
Omidyar decided more than two years ago to launch a news service to cover local civic affairs , including the state , city , education , land and money . `` It 's very important for me that we demonstrate that we can do this sustainably , '' they said .
Another unique aspect will be the discussion section . Unlike traditional newspaper online comment sections which are often marred by hateful , obscene , racist or mindless commentary posted by anonymous readers , Civil Beat members will be identified and no anonymous comments will be allowed .
`` We 'll have a billing relationship with them and so we know who they are , '' Omidyar said .
Gerald Kato , chair at the University of Hawaii school of communications , said newspaper subscribers were coveted because they were considered to be older , wealthier and better educated . But many had been turned off by what Kato described as `` crazies '' who participate in unmoderated comment sections .
`` They 're trying to flip that around . They want all these high-end people that would gravitate toward a newspaper , but want to filter out all the crazies , '' Kato said . `` The filtering mechanism would be : you pay to play . ''
Omidyar said they were hoping to encourage a `` higher level of conversation '' . `` I think the quality of conversation is going to be something which really creates a sense of value for people , '' they said , especially for people who are concerned about issues in their community and want meaningful discussions and debate .
The unassuming Honolulu billionaire declined to say how much they have invested so far . The editor of the news service is veteran newspaperman John Temple , who served as editor , president and publisher of the Rocky Mountain News , which ceased publication in February 2009 .
Omidyar points out that , unlike a newspaper , they have no printing presses , trucks , sales staff or other `` legacy '' obligations . They said having a membership payment provided instant feedback from the readers . They called traditional news organisations `` advertising based '' , with publishers answering to advertisers instead of the community .
`` I think having a more direct business model will help us and I think it 's going to be part of the future for the industry as well , '' they said .
Why do hip-hop producers gravitate toward jazz samples ? For a mood , for sonic timbre , for a unique rhythmic component . Swing is a precursor to the boom-bap . `` If you 're a hip-hop producer that wants a lot of melodic stuff happening , '' pianist Robert Glasper says , `` you 're probably going to go to jazz first . ''
Glasper has lived in an area of overlap between jazz and hip-hop for more than two decades — and you can hear it in their piano playing , which often drifts into cyclical rhythms akin to a beat-maker 's loops . It 's all one and the same to Glasper : recasting the music of Miles Davis for an R & B audience or rocking live shows with Q-Tip ; playing acoustic jazz with their trio or streamlined soul with their Grammy-winning Robert Glasper Experiment .
In this short doc , Glasper identifies three jazz samples , from tracks by Ahmad Jamal and Herbie Hancock , that have served as source material for famed hip-hop producers J Dilla and Pete Rock .

Srinagar , May 16
The Jammu and Kashmir High Court made a teacher write an essay on cow and solve a Class IV maths problem in an open court and ordered slapping a case against them when they failed , inviting strong observations from the judge who wanted “ soulless ” authorities to close down education “ tuck shops ” .
The direction came yesterday when Justice Muzaffar Hussain Attar was hearing a petition challenging appointment of Mohammad Imran Khan as Rehbar-e-Taleem ( education guide ) teacher in a school in south Kashmir .
The petitioner had alleged that Khan 's certificates , issued by the Board of Higher Secondary Education Delhi and Global Open University , Nagaland , were not recognised . The marksheet issued to the respondent by the Board of Higher Secondary Education , Delhi , showed they had secured 74 per cent , 73 per cent and 66 per cent in Urdu , English and Maths , respectively .
The court asked a senior counsel to give a simple line for translation from English to Urdu and vice-versa , but the teacher failed .
The teacher was then asked to write an essay on ‘ cow ' in Urdu , but they failed . Khan sought permission to write the essay outside the courtroom , which was granted but they failed again .
Khan , who claimed they had better hold on mathematics , was then asked to solve a maths problem for fourth graders .
As they failed yet again , a visually perturbed Justice Attar said , “ In this situation , what would be the fate of the state has to be only visualised . The school-going children ... would pass out as blockheads . ”
“ The authorities , responsible to ensure that the stream of academics and education is not polluted in the state of J & K , however , in view of the facts , which have surfaced in this case , have acted as soulless bodies with ray-less eyes , as they have criminally condoned and over-looked the Himalayan blunders committed in procuring the academic degrees , ” the court observed .
Justice Attar went on to describe the study centres which provide certificates to unworthy candidates as “ tuck shops ” .
“ The writ petition at hand throws up most startling and classical example of sale and purchase of academic degrees , for which many tuck shops are operating in the state and responsible for relegating the student community to the dark cave of Plato , ” they said .
The court also directed Commissioner and Secretary of the Education Department to constitute a panel which would ask the teachers who produce such degrees to appear for screening and ascertain if they had the required ability to teach students .
“ The ReT teachers who fail in such a screening test , their certificates would require to be seized after affording opportunity of hearing to them . The authorities shall consider termination of their services after following principles of natural justice as same will be in the larger interest of the student community and society , ” the court said .
The judge then asked the Director , School Education Department , to refer the instant case to the police station concerned for registration of a case to initiate action . — PTI
INCIDENT : New Zealand Cricket says Tim Southee did 'nothing untoward ' on the flight from Sydney to Dubai on route to the World Cup .
Black Caps team manager Dave Currie says reports of a player behaving in a `` lewd '' manner toward a woman on an international flight were not factual and the matter would not be taken any further .
A passenger on the flight between Sydney and Dubai told Newstalk ZB the incident involved a Black Caps player and a woman they met on the plane .
The passenger described it as the `` worst possible sort of lewd behaviour '' , the station reported .
Currie confirmed to NZPA the player was Tim Southee but said they had investigated and established the reports were not factually correct .
`` We have investigated and spoken to a number of other players and we are satisfied that nothing untoward has happened . ''
Currie said the woman had made no complaint .
New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan told TV3 's Campbell Live they had spoken to Southee , who was adamant nothing untoward had happened .
`` I 've spoken to Tim , I 've also spoken to the team manager Dave Currie , I 've spoken to ( captain ) Dan Vettori and a number of other players '' Vaughan said
`` It appears pretty innocent really .
`` I think Tim met a female passenger and struck up a conversation They spent a bit of time and had a drink together on the plane .
`` At some stage the female passenger came to Tim 's seat and perhaps spent a maximum of 30 seconds with Tim , and there may well have been , dare I say it , a kiss on the cheek , but that was it . They went back to their seat , and Tim is adamant that nothing inappropriate , nothing untoward , occurred . ''
Vaughan said a number of other players had supported Southee 's version of events
The team 's media manager , Ellery Tappin , said they were `` dumbfounded '' by the amount of attention the reports had garnered .
`` We 've done a thorough investigation and found absolutely nothing substantial , so are incredibly surprised by the amount of attention it 's generated and are all a bit dumbfounded , to be perfectly honest , about how this has escalated , '' they said .

The Ottawa Fury FC dropped another three points this weekend , as they failed to take advantage of an early Carl Haworth goal to lose 1-2 at home against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers . The Strikers had come into the match in 9th place in the Spring Season , while Ottawa came in one place behind the Strikers at the bottom of the 10-team standings . The home loss left Ottawa with only 1 point in 5 games in the NASL Fall Season , and 4 points adrift of FC Edmonton , albeit with 1 game in hand .
The Opening 45
GK Romuald Peiser started their second match in a row , while LB Maykon was a late addition to the starting XI in place of Ramon Soria , who picked up a knock in training during the week . DM and captain Richie Ryan came back into the starting XI after recovering from their warmup injury last week at the expense of Canadian youth international Mauro Eustaquio , while ST Vini Dantas and winger Oliver were also drafted into the starting lineup .
Ottawa started off strong , putting lots of pressure on the Strikers ' defense in the early minutes and creating several chances , with CM Nicki Paterson curling a 25-yard free kick just wide . It only took 10 minutes before Ottawa scored the go-ahead goal , as the Strikers ' defence failed to clear a Richie Ryan pass properly , and the ball fell to the feet of winger Carl Haworth , who neatly put the ball into the top far corner of the net from the edge of the 18 yard box . The goal represented Haworth 's first professional goal , as well as the Fury FC 's first goal at TD Place .
It only took six minutes for Fort Lauderdale to find an equalizer , however , as striker Fafa Picault was able to latch onto the end of a sloppy back pass by Paterson and held off CB Drew Beckie before converting the ball past Peiser . Ottawa pushed on for the rest of the first half , looking for another go-ahead goal . The Fury FC controlled the play and created chances through the majority of the period ; however , the closest they got to another goal was when Dantas ' shot off of a low right-wing cross was cleared off the line by an alert Fort Lauderdale defender .
The Second Half
The second half started off with a fantastic Haworth shot from an Oliver long ball that was saved by Strikers GK David Meves . The Fury created more chances , particularly down their left flank , with Oliver and Maykon particularly active , but the team was wasteful in their finishing . Ubiparipovic had a great moment , settling down a loose ball in the air , and taking it on the volley , but shooting straight at the keeper . As the game progressed , the match looked more and more likely as if it was heading for a draw . However , soon after an attacking substitution for Fort Lauderdale , right-back Darnell King made a fantastic off-the-ball run through the heart of Ottawa 's defense , and was able to latch onto a precise through-ball from CAM Mark Anderson and lift the ball past Peiser in the 76th minute .
Much like the game versus Minnesota , Ottawa was left chasing the game in the late stages and put on a significant amount of pressure near the end , creating several opportunities . Haworth had the best attempt to tie the game , with a side-footed volley from a curled Ubiparipovic cross in injury time . However , they were unable to convert any of the chances and ended up leaving the pitch with a disappointing 1-2 home loss . Their positive start to the match , and the chances created that were left unconverted , left manager Marc Dos Santos and the squad questioning how they did not come away with at least a point from the game .

Matt Young / AP Liz Cheney speaks during a campaign appearance in Casper , Wyo. , on July 17 , 2013
Everyone must be looking forward to Thanksgiving at the Cheney house . Former Vice President Dick Cheney 's daughters have found themselves at the center of the culture wars again , when Mary Cheney and their wife chided Liz Cheney for opposing gay marriage during a nationally televised interview on Sunday .
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Liz Cheney said they disagreed with their younger sister 's decision to marry their longtime partner Heather Poe in an interview on Fox News Sunday , leading Poe to publicly express their disappointment with their sister-in-law via Facebook .
“ When Mary and I got married in 2012 — [ Liz ] did n't hesitate to tell us how happy they were for us , ” wrote Poe . “ To have them now say they do n't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least . ”
Mary Cheney shared their partner 's Facebook message , adding : “ Liz — this is n't just an issue on which we disagree — you 're just wrong — and on the wrong side of history . ”
Late Sunday , Mary Cheney told The New York Times that it would be “ impossible ” for them and their sister to repair their relationship as long as Liz Cheney was against gay marriage :
“ What amazes me is that they say she 's running to be a new generation of leader , ” Mary Cheney said , citing their 47-year-old sister 's slogan in their campaign against Mr. Enzi , 69 . “ I 'm not sure how sticking to the positions of the last 20 or 30 years is the best way to do that . ”
Mary Cheney also told the Times that they “ will not be seeing ” their sister during a family gathering this Thanksgiving and suggested that they did n't mind complicating Liz 's campaign for U.S. Senate in Wyoming . Liz Cheney 's stance on gay marriage has been a source of debate in Wyoming , where a super PAC ran an ad questioning their conservative views on the issue .

By Rob Mahoney
Just before the new year ushers in a clean slate and a boundless optimism , let 's examine at the grimmer side of the season thus far : the league 's biggest disappointments . Though many of these 12 players figure to rebound , it 's worth taking stock of their woes two months into the season . ( All stats are through Thursday . )
FIRST TEAM
Andrea Bargnani , Toronto Raptors : After a brief masquerade as a competent defender at the beginning of last season , the old Bargnani has returned to wreak havoc on Dwane Casey 's psyche and more than earn the former No . 1 pick their place on the trade block . Bargnani may well lead the league in wide-eyed looks as an opponent 's drive goes uncontested , which pairs perfectly with their underwhelming offense to complete a dismal package . An elbow injury will keep them sidelined for a little while longer , but it 's becoming increasingly clear that the Raptors ' hopes for Bargnani 's evolution will go unrewarded .
It 's a tired refrain given that Toronto has waited for Bargnani at every stage in their supposed development only to be let down . The Raptors banked on gradual improvement in their work on the glass , but Bargnani 's rebounding percentage has slipped this season after years of mild fluctuation . They 've assumed that they might convert some nice individual offensive skills into a more cooperative overall game , but they remain difficult to utilize within a balanced team concept . The defensive issues are the most stark of all , and the gap between Bargnani 's slow-reacting coverage and defensive mediocrity should n't be understated . All that was really asked of them was to become passable on that end , as to better accentuate all that they can contribute offensively . But even that low bar now seems to be a lofty ambition , with a wavering focus the only constant in Bargnani 's unreliable defensive game .
Ersan Ilyasova , Milwaukee Bucks : Watch Milwaukee play , and one can see Ilyasova 's crisis of confidence in action -- a player who sank 46 percent of their three-pointers last season is pump-faking out of self-doubt . He 's starting to score and rebound a bit more , but their shooting percentages have n't fully recovered . Ilyasova 's true shooting percentage ( which accounts for their threes , twos and free throws as weighted by their value ) has dropped by 10 full points , making their bankable 2011-12 season look all the more like an aberration . If that 's the case , the Bucks are in for a long four or five years , depending on what they decide to do with them in the partially guaranteed final year of their contract .
Last season 's version of Ilyasova ( who averaged 17 points and 11.5 rebounds per 36 minutes with a career-high 57.7 true shooting percentage ) was absolutely worth the $ 40 million deal that the Bucks awarded him . But this year 's iteration , though still a helpful player , has diminished enough to make such a deal incredibly costly . Teams can no longer afford to dole out such substantial contracts without clear payoff , particularly when the future of the rest of the roster remains so tenuous .
But all of this is looking a bit too far ahead for a player who has actually managed to resurrect their previous form for a few games at a time . Ilyasova most recently had 17 points and 11 rebounds against the Nets , and they managed a five-game stretch of double-digit scoring earlier this month . December has been decidedly more kind to Ilyasova than November was , to the point that I feel slightly guilty for harping on a player who sincerely seems to be on the rise . That said , it 's become so difficult to know what to expect from Ilyasova on a game-by-game basis that their season can only track as a disappointment -- relative to both their recent contract and the assumed progress of their 2011-12 season .
Deron Williams , Brooklyn Nets : Regardless of whether you blame Avery Johnson ( who has lost their job based on Brooklyn 's .500 record ) or Williams himself , this has been a lackluster season for a point guard once considered to be the class of their profession . A wrist injury and a meager supporting cast helped explain away Williams ' struggles with efficiency over the last few seasons , but reasonably good health and roster renovations now put their errant shooting on display for all to see . They have a big man to work with in Brook Lopez . They have two talented ( and very different ) scorers on the wings in Joe Johnson and Gerald Wallace . They have the ball in their hands , and now has Avery Johnson 's slow-down offense in ruin . It 's now up to Williams to live up to their own game , something they have n't done for a while .

Courtney Lee , Boston Celtics : Fits between team and player rarely come cleaner than the meeting of Lee , a skilled and versatile combo guard who plays solid on-ball defense , and the Celtics , a team that needed Lee 's fill-the-gaps dynamism to boost their offensive potential . Lee may not be prolific enough from the perimeter to replace Ray Allen outright , but they seemed a fitting substitute for a team that has every incentive to get younger and quicker as to best prolong the careers of Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce .
That 's a quaint notion , but has n't quite worked out in practice . Lee is making a career-low 28 percent from three-point range , and at their absolute best has been a functional stopgap for Boston 's second unit . Their complementary game has grown so agreeable as to be completely bland , and their most prominent defensive limitations ( his inability to body up opponents and fight through screens ) are only accentuated by playing with the Celtics ' second-unit big men . It 's been a hard fall for Lee , and a strange one ; I 'd bet on Lee 's figuring out the proper calibration of their offensive game at some point down the line , but for now he 's hardly living up to their presumed role within the Celtics ' reboot .
D.J . Augustin , Indiana Pacers : There are players on this list who have merely offered less than expected , but Augustin is one of the few exemplary disappointments who consistently does their team harm . Having a ball handler who is unable to see past the initial defense , consistently create dribble penetration or even get their shot off on the perimeter is brutal -- so much so that Augustin actually weighs down an already underwhelming bench . Playing with the starters more consistently might help some , as would getting Danny Granger back to widen Frank Vogel 's lineup options . But for now there is just no possible caveat that can obscure 28 percent shooting from the field from a score-first guard , or the general drag that Augustin puts on the Pacers in general .
( If you 're a glutton for a deeper explanation of Augustin 's troubles , check out this post . )
RESERVES
Pau Gasol , Los Angeles Lakers : Gasol has all kinds of alibis at their disposal -- a coaching change , knee tendinitis , the absence of Steve Nash/the Lakers actually relying on Chris Duhon , their recently diagnosed plantar fasciitis -- but that does n't at all excuse their abysmal defensive play . We can forgive some of the offensive issues as Gasol finds their way in a new role under Mike D'Antoni , but the frequency with which they have zoned out and completely missed rotations warrants placement in this bunch .

Manu Ginobili , San Antonio Spurs : It may seem odd to talk up the merits of a season in which Ginobili averaged only 12.9 points , but the super-sub had an incredible 2011-12 despite having their season sliced and diced by various ailments . In what was nearly a career low in playing time ( due to both injury and the evolution of the Spurs ' rotation ) , Ginobili 's creative brilliance was refined to an absurd purity ; 53 percent shooting from the field and 41 percent from three-point range is just batty for a player who handles the ball as much as Ginobili does , and yet that was the standard set based on last year 's showing . In any general sense , Ginobili is no disappointment this season . But their overall shooting ( 41.8 percent from the field , 35.7 percent from deep ) is depressed even relative to their typical shooting marks , and those scoring explosions are coming a bit less often . Manu 's still Manu , but last season 's bottled brilliance was clearly something special .
Austin Rivers , New Orleans Hornets : It may not be entirely fair to put a rookie on this list , but Rivers deserves special consideration due to being a lottery pick who has yet to cash in on their single pro-level attribute . Rivers ' defense was deemed suspect , their ball-handling shaky and their playmaking a work in progress . But their scoring ability was never much called into question , even though it very clearly should have been . He 's getting the playing time and touches necessary to improve , but at the moment Rivers drives with blinders on , scores a miserable 9.8 points per 36 minutes and is still figuring out how to contribute to a team 's offense in a beneficial way .
[ Ben Golliver : Q & A with Austin Rivers ]
Roy Hibbert , Indiana Pacers : Hibbert deserves a pat on the back for their general improvement over the last few weeks , but unfortunately that surge is n't significant enough to keep them off this list . Blame a perfect storm of expectations ; a great playoff run , a max contract and an injury to Granger put Hibbert in a position to produce more than ever , but considerable offensive struggles have resulted in career lows virtually across the board . Touch and size have earned Hibbert just 12.4 points per 36 minutes . He 's shooting 40.4 percent , well off their previous career worst of 46.1 in 2010-11 . Their rebounding percentage has dipped slightly and their turnover percentage has increased modestly . Even Hibbert 's passing game has suffered , as defenses have become well aware of their difficulties from the field and force them to beat one-on-one coverage -- thereby closing up kick-out opportunities .
That 's a brutal mix of statistical regression that has played a rather active role in Indiana 's offensive descent . The Wizards are the only team in the league to score fewer points per possession than the Pacers , and though Hibbert hardly deserves to bear the burden of such a ranking alone , they seemed theoretically prepared to assume a larger role in the offense ( and contribute more overall relative to prior seasons ) regardless of Granger 's absence . Perhaps they still are , but for the moment Hibbert is a good defensive center still working to rebuild their offensive game after a recently disclosed wrist injury . That ailment should clearly weigh into our evaluations of Hibbert 's depressed numbers , but it does n't altogether exempt them from blame for their glaring inability to make an offensive impact .
Denver forward Danilo Gallinari is shooting a career-low 39.1 percent from the field . ( David Zalubowski/AP )
Danilo Gallinari , Denver Nuggets : Maybe the greater disappointment here does n't rest with Gallinari , but with our assumptions of linear development . They began their career as a decent scorer who could both shoot from the outside and get to the rim , all while defending with a plucky enthusiasm ( even if not with totally sound fundamentals ) . Their production as a sophomore with the Knicks in 2009-10 suggested a talented shot creator with a versatile game , and to some extent that still applies . But even after that promising start , Gallinari 's shooting percentages never quite came around , and their scoring has increased only marginally over the course of their career . This season in Denver seemed like a great opportunity for Gallinari to not only command serious minutes but also benefit from the playmaking of both an improving Ty Lawson and the imported Andre Iguodala . That has n't quite worked out , and Gallinari has posted career-worst shooting percentages ( 39.1 from the field , 31.7 from long distance ) while otherwise maintaining their static -- and decent , really -- levels of production .
Kendrick Perkins , Oklahoma City Thunder : Fair or not , Perkins is a disappointment by way of coach Scott Brooks , who insists on relying on Perk 's intangibles at the sake of their team 's actual performance . Brooks has grown more flexible and creative over the years , but Perkins is the vestige of their former coaching traditionalism that they ca n't seem to shed . Opponents are getting better and better at exploiting Perkins ' presence on the floor , but OKC has stood by its chemistry and its 28-year-old center .
Perkins is good to have around for defending specific interior threats , but he 's a specialist who holds back the Thunder as a second big man . If he 's tabbed to play with four perimeter players , so be it . But Perkins lacks the ability to force opponents to defend him , limiting the explosive potential of some of the Thunder 's most-used lineups .
Dosima fascicularis , the buoy barnacle , is `` the most specialised pleustonic goose barnacle '' species . [ 4 ] It hangs downwards from the water surface , held up by a float of its own construction , and is carried along by ocean currents .
Flotation [ edit ]
As an adult , D. fascicularis lives attached to a float made either of natural flotsam or of a cement it secretes itself , which has a texture like that of expanded polystyrene foam . [ 5 ] It is the only barnacle to produce its own gas-filled float . [ 3 ] The cyprid larvae are planktonic , and must attach to a float for metamorphosis into the adult form , but the adults are eventually capable of using their own float , sometimes forming aggregations of many individuals attached to a single float . Among the floats used by adult buoy barnacles are pellets of tar , [ 6 ] seaweeds , [ 3 ] [ 7 ] plastic debris , [ 7 ] driftwood , [ 7 ] feathers , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] cranberries , [ 3 ] cuttlefish bone , [ 3 ] the `` by-the-wind-sailor '' Velella velella , seagrass leaves , [ 4 ] Styrofoam , [ 6 ] seeds , [ 6 ] and even apples ; [ 3 ] they have even been known to colonise the backs of turtles [ 8 ] and the sea snake Pelamis platurus . [ 9 ] It is a fugitive species , which can be out-competed by other barnacle species , and relies on being able to colonise surfaces and reproduce quickly ; after settling on a float , D. fascicularis can reproduce within 45 days . [ 10 ] D. fascicularis appears to be increasing in abundance as a result of anthropogenic marine debris accumulating in the sea ; [ 6 ] this source of floats was of `` minor importance '' in 1974 . [ 4 ]
Related species [ edit ]
Although formerly placed in the genus Lepas , the buoy barnacle is now generally placed in its own monotypic genus , Dosima . Dosima is distinguished from Lepas by the form of the carina , and by the exceptional thinness and brittleness of its exoskeleton . [ 11 ]
Distribution [ edit ]
D. fascicularis has a cosmopolitan distribution , with a preference for temperate seas , [ 12 ] having been found at latitudes from 71° North off Siberia to 57° South near Cape Horn . [ 3 ] Groups have been observed journeying from Japan to the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean , [ 3 ] and sometimes wash up on westerly and southerly beaches in the British Isles , as well as westerly beaches further south in Europe . [ 5 ] [ 13 ] It is not normally found in the Mediterranean Sea , but may have begun to colonise there from the Atlantic Ocean . [ 14 ]
Amanda Palmer : Soldiering — mothers of this nation have a different agenda
Amanda Palmer ; an artist of immense creativity , spirit , and emotion , has just released a new powerful video for their rendition of Pink Floyd 's “ Mother ” . Palmer who is independently crowdfunded by their 11,000 subscribers on patreon.com , leads by example in this bold piece of art which is , in their words , “ dedicated to the current administration . ”
As the official press release states : Shooting on location in upstate New York at the iconic sculpture park , Opus 40 , Palmer collaborated with a female director ( Jordan Rathus ) and choreographer ( Coco Karol ) , in addition to an all-female string quartet and two of their fellow mother-musicians ( Zoë Keating and Melissa Auf der Maur , ex-bassist of Hole and Smashing Pumpkins ) .
Palmer 's idea for the video inspired the recording for the song , and they tapped long-time friend/composer Jherek Bischoff ( Strung Out in Heaven , Purple Rain ) to join their vision and supply a bittersweet and poignant string quartet arrangement of Pink Floyd 's “ Mother ” . Zoë Keating stood in for David Gilmour 's searing guitar solo on cello .
From their days as Cambridge 's eight-foot bride , to fronting the Dresden Dolls , to being a best-selling author , Palmer has continuously driven off a point of — the value of connection . Them courage and openness inspire both their dedicated fan base ( more like a community ) and other artists to put one foot in front of the other , and stand proud . “ Mother ” is Palmer 's latest representation that comes from a deep perspective , being a mother themselves to a now two-year-old son .
Here , Palmer dives into the motivation behind their craft , while embodying one of the most special words on the planet .
Amanda Palmer :
“ The lyrics to ‘ Mother ' haunted me during the inauguration . There 's a surge in female power right now : Trump and co. can prattle on about how they 're going to build a big , beautiful wall , but the mothers of this nation have a different agenda . We do n't want our children to grow up in a world of fear , separation , and scarcity .
I 've made over a dozen big-production videos with massive casts and crews , but I 've never felt this way on a set before . Ever since having a baby I 've been continuing to work on producing content , and I often bring my baby to recording studios and video sets where it is cheerfully tolerated . But this time it was n't just tolerated , it was celebrated .
Everybody on the set — from the film crew to the dancers — stood by the spirit of the script . All of the children cast are children of friends of mine . Chris Wells , who plays “ The President ” , is an openly gay actor and peace activist and it meant a lot to me to be able to cast them in this role .
“ That finale-scene could not have happened if it were n't for our deep respect for one another ; I could n't have done it with just any actor and it took a massive amount of trust . Melissa Auf der Maur and Zoë Keating have both been my guiding lights as fellow mothers and musicians . This video is as much an homage to them as it is a statement about the current administration . ”

One of the relatively few DC Comics writers to be well into the second year of their original New 52 gig , Kyle Higgins has big plans for Nightwing , the original Robin who many fans think of as the first born son of the DC Universe ; the younger readers ' original counterpart in Batman 's world of mystery , danger and adventure . But as Higgins explains in an interview conducted just ahead of Nightwing # 18 's release this week , defining Dick Grayson by their relationship to the Batman has its dramatic drawbacks . Teaming with artist Brett Booth for what 's intended to be another long stretch of issues , Higgins aspires to define Nightwing as their own man with their own mythology , cast and indeed city . Issue # 19 will see the superhero relocate to Higgins ' hometown of Chicago on a mission that has major emotional weight for the young hero .
Click ahead to read what Higgins had to say about the future of Nightwing , but not before you read issue # 18 . On sale now and drawn by Juan Jose Ryp , the issue concludes with a major revelation that will drive the action in Nightwing for the foreseeable future . In other words , SPOILER ALERT .
ComicsAlliance : So Bret Booth and your new storyline begin in next month 's Nightwing # 19 , but there 's a new issue out this week . Presumably that deals with the recent death of Damian Wayne Robin .
Kyle Higgins : Obviously issue # 18 deals with the events of Batman , Incorportated # 8 in a certain way -- specifically the fallout of Damian 's death . As it relates to Dick Grayson , Damian was something of a light at the end of the tunnel for Dick . Having just gone through all the chaos and all these tragic events [ in previous Nightwing issues ] , Damian is the one who was there for Dick like a brother . They were the one who essentially said , `` You can lean on me if you have to . '' Just when things were looking up for Dick , Damian was taken from them as well . So issue # 18 is about Dick finding the resolve to pull themselves out of this . It 's manifested in the way Dick stops the dealer who 's trying to sell Dick 's father 's Flying Graysons costume , which has been Jokerized . But just as Dick finds that resolve to get some closure on Damian , Sonia Zucco lets slip the bombshell that their father [ Tony Zucco , the murderer of Dick 's parents ] is still alive and living under an alias in Chicago .
CA : Ah ha . Hence Nightwing 's relocation to Chicago .
KH : Exactly . Issue # 19 is the beginning of the Chicago arc . As far as Dick is concerned , it 's a one-and-done deal . He 's here to find the man who killed their parents . Tony being alive is an interesting dynamic for a few reasons . Firstly , he 's the man who really changed the course of Dick 's life forever . He 's the man that took Dick 's parwents from him . But also in the aftermath of all of this tragedy having struck Dick in recent months , Tony being alive and at large is something Dick can actually control . It 's something Dick can actually deal with . That 's very appealing at this point in their life .
CA : Why send Nightwing to another city ? For the story purposes , why is Zucco in Chicago and not in Gotham City ?
KH : Well clearly Zucco likes deep dish pizza and is a fan of the Bears . I really did n't have a choice in that matter . But on a serious note , there are a couple of reasons . The first is primarily because ... being a character in the New 52 and being involved in a lot of the crossovers , I 've started to feel like we 've been establishing a ceiling for Nightwing in the way that they are being defined by their relationship to Batman and the way that they fit into some of the crossovers . One of the things I really want to do going forward is find a way to define Dick Grayson and Nightwing in a way that the fact that they were Robin is just one aspect of their life . Not the overreaching defining trait about him . I think if you ask most people to describe Nightwing in two or three sentences , the first thing they 're going to say is , `` Well , they used to be Robin , but now he 's grown up and he 's their own guy . '' What I 'm looking to do is develop a mythology , a cast and a rogues gallery and a world for Dick Grayson and for Nightwing that is centered on the fact that they were a circus performer who watched their parents fall to their deaths when Tony Zucco cut the trapeze wire , and now their motivating force as Nightwing is they want to catch people when they fall . In order to do that , I feel like we have to tell the story outside of Gotham City .
KH : There 's also the logistics aspect of it . If you 're going to set a story in Gotham City , there is a logistical feeling that you 're up against in terms of how big the story can ever get or how terrifying the villain can ever be . At a certain point the reader tends to ask , `` Why is n't Batman getting involved ? '' That point speaks to what I was saying , the ceiling of defining Dick and Nightwing by their relationship with Batman .
CA : How is Chicago different for Nightwing in terms of being a masked superhero ? Are there even any other superheroes in Chicago ?
KH : There used to be heroes in the city . There were a handful of heroes and masked vigilantes several years ago . There are no longer `` masks '' in the city . They 're actually all dead . That 's a story point and a history that we 'll be developing , as Nightwing is the first `` mask '' to show up in in the Windy City in some time . We 'll start to draw that out and perhaps see some characters from that old group .
CA : And as far as Dick Grayson 's personal life is concerned ?
KH : Most of the money they had burned up [ in a previous story ] . So now he 's heading to the city with , as the first issue of the arc puts it , `` two pennies and a Nightwing suit to their name . '' He 'll be subletting an apartment for a few weeks or months , depending on how long he 's going to be in Chicago for Zucco . And when the Nightwing suit gets torn up he 's going to have to figure out how to fix it . It 's definitely much more of an everyman approach to the character . It 's something I 've been thinking about for a while now , ways to make them more relatable . That 's also another reason why I chose Chicago . I chose a real city because I think that setting helps ground the story in a way that readers can relate to .
CA : And it helps that you 're from Chicago , right ?
KH : Oh , that was n't a factor at all ...
( click image to enlarge )
CA : And you 're working with Bret Booth on this story , he 's the new ongoing artist , right ?
KH : Yes . Bret comes on with issue # 19 . Their style is very much geared towards a character like Nightwing . It 's very expressive , very energetic . It 's a collaboration that 's been very rewarding for me personally . Bret and I talk a lot , we go through every story together . He 's someone I can call when I get stuck on something and we talk through it . He 's also someone who does n't sleep . The dude is so fast , it 's really very impressive ! He 's working on the third issue of the run right now and we 've got plans for a long tenure on the book . Knock on wood .
Note : FactChecker is a new monthly series in which Glenn T. Stanton examines claims , myths , and misunderstandings frequently heard in evangelical circles .
Christians use lots of quotes . Pastors use them in their sermons constantly . Writers illustrate their points with them . Nothing wrong with that . They are quite helpful and encouraging in making a point .
Save when the quote has no basis in fact .
We as evangelicals who claim we are committed to truth are certainly good at spreading falsehood , even if unintentionally . We can do better .
One very clever and popular quote we often knock around among ourselves is . . .
Preach the Gospel at all times . Use words if necessary .
It is always attributed to St. Francis of Assisi—founder of the Franciscan Order—and is intended to say that proclaiming the Gospel by example is more virtuous than actually proclaiming with voice . It is a quote that has often rankled me because it seems to create a useless dichotomy between speech and action . Besides , the spirit behind it can be a little arrogant , intimating that those who “ practice the Gospel ” are more faithful to the faith than those who preach it .
But here 's the fact : Our good Francis never said such a thing . None of their disciples , early or later biographers have these words coming from their mouth . It does n't show up in any of their writings . Not even close really . The closest comes from their Rule of 1221 , Chapter XII on how the Franciscans should practice their preaching :
No brother should preach contrary to the form and regulations of the holy Church nor unless they have been permitted by their minister … All the Friars … should preach by their deeds .
Essentially , make sure your deeds match your words . While there 's a nice and good sentiment in the statement—be sure you live out the grace and truth of the Gospel—the notion as it is typically presented is neither practical , nor faithful to the Gospel of Christ . It does not align with St. Francis ' own practice .
Their first biographer , Thomas of Celeno , writing just three years after Francis ' death , quotes them instructing their co-workers in the Gospel thusly ,
The preacher must first draw from secret prayers what they will later pour out in holy sermons ; they must first grow hot within before they speak words that are in themselves cold .
Mark Galli , senior managing editor at Christianity Today , wrote a wonderful little book on Francis as well as a clarifying brief article on the myth of this quote . They explain that Francis was quite a preacher , actually more along the lines of Jonathan Edwards or Billy Sunday than most of those who misquote them would like to think . Galli quotes Thomas ' biography ,
Their words were neither hollow nor ridiculous , but filled with the power of the Holy Spirit , penetrating the marrow of the heart , so that listeners were turned to great amazement .
Our man clearly spent a great deal of time using their words when they preached , “ sometimes preaching in up to five villages a day , often outdoors . In the country , Francis often spoke from a bale of straw or a granary doorway . In town , they would climb on a box or up steps in a public building . They preached to . . . any who gathered to hear the strange but fiery little preacher from Assisi. ” They were sometimes so animated and passionate in their delivery that “ his feet moved as if they were dancing . ”
Duane Liftin , president emeritus of Wheaton College , recently addressed the trouble with this preach/practice dichotomy in an important article . Of preaching the Gospel in deed , they explain ,
It 's simply impossible to preach the Gospel without words . The Gospel is inherently verbal , and preaching the Gospel is inherently verbal behavior .
And the “ deed ” proclamation of the Gospel is not biblical either . Paul asks the Church at Rome ( Romans 10:14 ) :
How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed ? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard ? And how will they hear without a preacher ?
So next time you hear one of your brothers or sisters in Christ use this quote to encourage or challenge you in your labors for our faith , gently guide them from the land of misinformation and make believe into truth .
Plans Moving Forward to Build 35-Story Tower on North Market Parking Lot
Rendering/design via Schooley Caldwell .
The City of Columbus has chosen a 35-story tower as the winning proposal for the North Market parking lot .
The proposal , called Market Tower , is from the Wood Companies and Schiff Capital Group . It would consist of approximately 200 residential units above office space , with restaurant and retail uses on the first two floors .
The first and second floors will also have about 10,000 additional square feet for the North Market to use , including a public atrium that will connect the new building with the existing market . The plan calls for the historic North Market building to remain intact and for the market to be open throughout the entire construction process .
“ We 're very excited about it , they 've put together a fantastic proposal , ” said Development Director Steve Schoeny . “ It really enhances the market , puts a new signature building on our skyline , and accomplishes all the objectives that we set out to at the outset of this . ”
The new building , along with a new outdoor plaza running along Spruce Street , would sit on top of an underground garage meant to replace the surface lot being lost to the development . That garage , with roughly the same number of parking spaces as the existing lot , would continue to serve North Market customers .
An additional 160 parking spots would be provided on the third and fourth floors of the building , and would connect via a bridge to the existing Vine Street garage . The goal for starting construction on the new development is the spring of 2018 , with completion in the spring of 2020 .
Since the city and market narrowed the list of proposals to develop the lot to three finalists in December , anticipation at the prospect of adding a significant addition to the Columbus skyline has grown , as have concerns about the impact of the project on the surrounding neighborhood , and on the market itself .
Schoeny and North Market Executive Director Rick Harrison Wolfe are both convinced that the Wood/Schiff proposal not only addresses those concerns , but provides a way forward for the market that will allow it to thrive for years to come .
“ Just having 500 or so residents coming or going right in front of us , that 's a game-changer , ” said Wolfe . “ That 's a lot of potential customers for our vendors . It will help our fresh merchants , in particular , to stay alive , prosper , and hopefully grow . ”
The goal is to have stores and restaurants in the new building that would complement the market . The application submitted by the development team said that “ an anticipated retail pharmacy at the corner of Wall St. and Vine St. and other ground floor retail and restaurant spaces will further engage the street and increase pedestrian traffic . ”
The application also outlined a number of ideas for making sure that the market benefits from all those new residents , such as a membership program in which residents would agree to spend a certain amount at the market monthly . The new building will also greatly expand the capacity of the market to make money off of events , which is currently a relatively small source of revenue .
“ Our success will be totally driven off of a vibrant market , ” said Mark Wood , President of the Wood Companies . “ So from a community perspective , we are super-proud to be involved , but from a business perspective , too , the project will be so closely tied to the success of the market . ”
Schoeny said that track record of the Wood Companies and Schiff Capital was another reason their proposal was chosen — particularly their success in working with historic buildings and in historic neighborhoods .
“ Schiff has done a great job with the Atlas building , and has been involved with a lot of other projects , ” said Schoeny . “ And Mark , and their dad before him , they were really pioneers in how to do this in the Short North . ”
Although the exact financial terms of the deal are still being worked out , the basic outline calls for the city to transfer ownership of the market itself to the North Market Development Authority , the nonprofit organization that runs the market . The parking lot would be transferred to the development team , and the city would help fund the parking garage , plaza , and other costs , such as utility upgrades . The total investment from the development team will be about $ 100 million .
“ For the market , the story here is , that for the first time in 141 years , we know our future , ” said Wolfe . “ We 've been a tenant , and we 've had a great landlord and partner in the city , but now we control our destiny…we 're here to stay , and we 're grateful for that , and we all should be grateful that we will have a public market forever…not many cities can say that . ”
Construction will likely take around 24 months , but Wood said that the plan is to open the underground garage first , even before the building above it is completed .
“ We will need to get creative about parking during the construction , ” Wolfe said , adding that they have spoken to the owners of nearby parking lots and is confident that arrangements can be made . “ It 's a three minute walk from the closest surface lot , the one by BBR , but we are open to ideas like a valet service , for our fresh merchants , also . ”
The future parking needs of the project were also considered – the third and fourth floor garages were designed so that they could be converted into offices space if that much parking is not necessary in twenty years , due to the growth of driverless cars or other technological advances ( cars would access the parking from the Vine Street garage across the street , so there are no ramps in the proposed building ) .
Schoeny cautioned that the proposal being presented now will change with input from merchants and the public .
“ We have a long road ahead of us still , but we want this to be sort of the start of the next phase of where we go , ” they said , ” and that will include a lot of public outreach and also a lot of back and forth negotiation to figure out what 's going to be a really complex real estate transaction . ”
The first public meeting on the project is scheduled for May 9th , at a location still to be determined . The development will also need to be approved by both the Downtown Commission and the Historic Resources Commission . Because it is in the Downtown District , there are no existing height restrictions or prohibited uses .
“ Something that I 've learned , ” said Wood , “ even just developing in the historic neighborhoods of Victorian Village and Italian Village , is that you go through the process , you have conversations with the commissions , and usually you end up with a better project ; not everyone is going to be happy with every decision that 's made , but going through that process creates a much better product . ”
Michael Schiff , Principal of Schiff Capital Group , expressed confidence that the size and scope of the project is appropriate given the current level of demand for apartments and condos in vibrant urban neighborhoods . “ We feel that it 's as good a location as you can get in Columbus for an urban development , ” they said , “ and the views will be phenomenal . ”

The Business of Screenwriting ( Part 1 ) : They do n't think like you
Scott Myers Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 23 , 2010
Hollywood studio executives can have a different way of seeing the world .
I am sitting in the office of a studio executive . At this point , K-9 has been produced , we 've sold a pitch to Warner Bros. , and have an overall studio deal . All good news , right ? Somehow we have managed to do something ( I forget what ) to irk this particular exec , so they call us in for a chat .
They are shifting back and forth in their chair behind their desk , hands working overtime as they explain why they feel aggrieved . Working themselves into a lather , they say the following :
“ Look , I like you guys , I really do . I mean , you are the first people I think of to call when one of my lunches cancels . ”
Read that comment again… and think about it for a moment .
To this exec , what they said was intended as a compliment . Not only a compliment , but the most direct and meaningful way they could think of to tell us how much they liked us .
That we were their first second choice .
And that in a nutshell conveys one of the most important truths a Hollywood outsider needs to know :
They do n't think like you .
You can be smart like them . As well educated as them . Drive the same car . Have the same politics . But unless you actually work in the entertainment business or grew up inside the bubble that is demarcated by the 405–10–110–101 freeways , there 's every chance in the world that the way you think and the way they think will be utterly different .
I lived and worked in L.A. for many years and I still do n't understand fully how their minds operate . But I do have some clues as to why they think the way they think .
* They are insanely busy . If I say “ Southern California , ” the first words that may pop into your mind are “ laid back. ” Nothing could not be further from the truth re people who are employed in the entertainment business because they work all the time . From 6AM when they hit the gym to work out until they finally finish reading the coverage on their latest project after midnight , their days are completely filled . Where you or I may go out for a leisurely meal , they have breakfast meetings , lunch meetings , dinner meetings . They do n't just get on the phone to talk , they roll calls , 100 or more business conversations on the phone per day . If they go to a concert or a movie or watch TV , it 's not a form of relaxation , it 's work . Day after day , week after week , year after year of that definitely contributes to the unique melange of their brain chemistry meets world view .
* They are extremely competitive . Stands to reason because movies , TV , web , music , they are all highly competitive businesses . They are all chasing after The Next Big Thing and that 's pretty much a zero sum game : x-amount of potential projects funnel into the system of which a small percentage are worthy of acquisition . As a result , the challenge to source the right stuff — whether it 's a manuscript , band , writer , story — is a stiff one because everyone else is doing precisely the same thing . On the whole , this requires a competitive impulse that is hard-wired in a person 's DNA . Here 's an example : I went to a Dodger game once with my agents where they basically bet on everything that happened : would the first pitch be a strike or a ball , which team would get the first hit , the first home run , even betting who would be closest to guessing the game 's attendance . As a producer once said to me , “ The movie business is one big dick-measuring contest . ”
* They all know each other . I was shocked to learn how small ‘ Hollywood ' is ( I 'm referring to the entertainment community , not Hollywood proper which by the way is home to only one major movie studio — Paramount ) . If something happens over in Culver City , word gets to people working in Burbank instantly . These folks see each other at screenings and concerts , their kids ' soccer games and school functions , The Ivy and Gelson 's . You and I call it ‘ networking . ' They know it simply as life . With such a tight-knit community of people , they have their own history , values , and business ethics . It 's a shared , self-reflective life-experience where they pretty much act under the assumption that this is how the world is .
These are just a few of the contributing factors to why they think the way they do . Bottom line : What an outsider is dealing with when interacting with an industry insider is someone who is always under the pressure of time , forever scanning the world around them for a hot new project , and doing their job virtually shoulder-to-shoulder with their competitors .
No wonder they develop their own world view and their own language system . So when you sell your spec script and make the rounds , do n't be surprised to hear things like this [ actual comments from our script meetings ] :
“ I like this scene , but could you make it 30 % funnier . ”
“ I know I told you to make that change , but I did n't mean it . ”
“ Can you make the Protagonist more sympathetic , you know… give them a dead wife or something ? ”
They 're smart , talented , busy , competitive , and in each other 's business all the time . Perhaps the best way for an outsider to look at it is like they 're part of a cult . What they do and how they think makes perfect sense to them , but can be mystifying to us .
Which is why you need to face facts : They do n't think like you .
The Business of Screenwriting is a weekly series of GITS posts based upon my experiences as a complete Hollywood outsider who sold a spec script for a lot of money , parlayed that into a screenwriting career during which time I 've made some good choices , some okay decisions , and some really stupid ones . Hopefully you 'll be the wiser for what you learn here .

MILWAUKEE ( WITI ) -- Milwaukee police say five people were shot during a vigil to remember a victim of gun violence near N. 29th and W. Burleigh .
The shooting took place Saturday evening , May 16th .
Authorities say a crowd had gathered in memory of 18-year-old Kendrai Walker killed Friday night , May 15th near 28th and Burleigh .
Police say the large group of people was in the alley when at least one person fired several shots .
Five people suffered gunshot wounds : three women , ages 57 , 52 and 24 -- and two men , ages 23 and 21 .
FOX6 News spoke with a man who was here when it happened . They tell us at least part of the group was participating in a community clean up and then they were having a vigil for the 18-year-old man who was shot and killed Friday night at 28th and Burleigh -- and that 's when Saturday 's shooting happened .
`` After we met up , people just started shooting at us and stuff , and you know , I had to take off running . So many shots rang out I had to get up out of there , '' said John Jackson , witness at the scene .
Jackson tells FOX6 News , one of the victims shot was the mother of Kendrai Walker who was shot and killed Friday night .
Police say all five victims received non-life threatening wounds and are being treated at a local hospital .
There are no suspects in custody at this time as authorities are still investigating this incident .
FOX6 News will continue to monitor this investigation and will update when more information is available .
Victoria cycling hero Ryder Hesjedal made history again Wednesday when they became the first cyclist to be named Canadian Press male athlete of the year .
The Belmont Secondary grad 's performance in the gruelling 3,500-kilometre Giro d'Italia in May clinched the honour , named for Lionel Conacher , a Canadian boxing champion , NHL player and Toronto Argonaut , who died in 1954 .
article continues below
Hesjedal won the Giro in 91 hours , 39 minutes and two seconds over 21 stages from Herning , Denmark , to Milan , Italy .
They were the first Canadian racer to win a Grand Tour event and only the second non-European to win the Giro .
“ You 're winning it every moment , over every kilometre for three weeks , ” said Hesjedal of their victory in Italy . “ It 's just incredible . There 's not really anything like it . Really , to be a Grand Tour winner , it 's a very small club and it 's a very elite club and I 'm very grateful for that .
“ I could n't have done it without the support of my team and my family and my friends and the fans and everyone over the years and years . It 's just a culmination of years and years of work . ”
Hesjedal is now training in Hawaii , spending most of their time on their bike getting ready for the upcoming season , said friend Bill Fry , co-owner of cycle store The Trek . “ He keeps amazing us — he 's done such a great job being an ambassador for cycling . ”
Hesjedal , 32 , grew up in the Highlands area , biking every day after school at Millstream Elementary .
They led the Canadian team at the Tour de France and represented Canada at the London Olympics in 2012 — but neither was a triumph . They finished 28th in the men 's time trial at the Olympics and crashed out of the Tour de France following a scary spill in the sixth stage .
Hesjedal said they rode on the shoulders of Island cycling greats they idolized while growing up , including Olympian and two-time world mountain-biking champion Roland Green and Olympian Andreas Hestler . “ I just naturally wanted to follow them and emulate them on the world stage , ” they once told the Times Colonist .
Hesjedal has said climate is a big part of the Island 's success in cycling and other Summer Olympics sports .
“ You do n't have to worry about snow and excessive cold here . As long as you do n't mind the wet , you 're good to go 12 months of the year and that 's been a huge factor in our favour on the Island , ” they said .
“ We lived in the Highlands and I biked to get around as a kid . It just seemed the thing to do . I would bike to and from school and also just for adventure and exploring . For a real challenge , I would ride over the Malahat to Cobble Hill or Shawnigan Lake or out to Sooke . ”
Given the massive publicity over Lance Armstrong 's loss of their seven Tour de France titles due to doping allegations , Hesjedal said , “ It 's even more crucial to recognize the achievements of now . ”
The winner of the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award as Canada 's female athlete of the year will be announced today .
Official Gi Review of The Rook by CTRL Industries
Summary
The Rook was the third gi made by CTRL Industries . Their first gi really piqued my interest and I definitely wanted to check it out , but I was n't so sure as a new gi company was popping up every day .
Let me say this .
Based on The Rook , not only is CTRL Industries here to stay and become a major player in the BJJ scene , but I 'm super upset that I never got that first Carioca gi .
At the end of my review is Joshua Barrow 's own review of The Rook . Click here to skip to that part .

Introduction
The Rook from CTRL Industries combines a very solid gi top and the best pair of pants that I have ever worn ( more on that later ) . As mentioned above , it is the third gi that they 've produced and , by all accounts , including my own , every single one has been extremely high quality . I believe that this trend will continue into the future as well .
Fit
Fit is everything in a BJJ gi . If a gi is too baggy , too long , too tight in all the wrong places , etc . it can turn a beautiful gi into something you let sit in the closet . Fortunately for me , CTRL has one of the best fitting gis that I have ever worn . I am 6 ' 1″ and fluctuate between 200-210lbs and the A3 fits me perfectly . The jacket has a great sleeve length and skirt length . The pants are the perfect length and cut for competition . My partners had a lot of trouble grabbing them due to the cut , which I absolutely love ( I detest baggy pants in BJJ ) .
Design
The design on this gi is very well done . They kept with the chess theme ( hence the gis name ) without going overboard with it . It can pass for a plain black gi with nice low-key accent stitching . But , it can also pass for a very bling gi if you dig the awesome taping ( which is n't scratchy and actually * is * seam taping ) and the very cool embroidery and shoulder patches .
Please excuse the random fuzz and whatnot on the gi in the pictures .
They were taken directly after an intense training session and after having worn it for a few weeks !
Jacket
The jacket on this gi looks very sharp and is a single weave top . This makes it great for training and for competition . I would probably prefer it for competition because I hate using super-thin gi jackets that let your opponent have whatever grips they want . It was a pleasure to train in and fared exactly the same as all of my other single weave gi tops , including my first gi . Despite being made of 550gm material ( meaning it weighs 550grams per yard of fabric ) , it felt very mobile and light . Future models made by CTRL Industries , including their newest release , the Carioca 1.2 , will be 450 gram material ( which is only slightly lighter , maybe 1/2 pound overall ) . Also , the jacket 's sleeves were a perfect width that they did n't feel like judo / wizard sleeves , but were also wide enough that I could easily execute Ezekiel chokes .

Trousers
Okay , let 's get to the best part of this gi . During my review for this gi , I had to message CTRL on Facebook with the following message :
I got in trouble during sparring today because after the first few rounds of rolling with people , everybody was really interested in what the heck the Rook 's gi pants were made out of . When the rest time between rounds ended , none of them had partners because they were all looking at the pants . Many pushups were done .
These are the best ripstop pants that I have ever worn . The material is very difficult to grip and seems exceptionally strong . Definitely the strongest pair of ripstop pants that I own ( as compared to 10+ other pairs of ripstop pants ) . The pants initially felt a bit waxy , which I had never felt on ripstop pants before , and they did soften a bit . Over time , they became easier to move in , but still very difficult for others to manipulate .
The cut on the Rook pants is really fantastic as well . It fits my thighs tighter than any of my other pants and the bottoms are a bit tighter on my calves as well . This leaves very little room for my training partner 's to grab to sweep me or pass my guard . This is exemplified beautifully in the video below .
Since they fit really well out of the bag , I always washed on cold and hung dry in my basement ( out of the sun ) to prevent any shrinkage or extra wear and tear . The knee reinforcements also fit my knees perfectly , not too low or too high . They feel strong and will likely hold up for a really long time .
The pants also held up very very well . The drawstring is stretchy and thin , but I experienced absolutely no wear and tear on it . The embroidery and all of the stitching ( including the really cool taping inside the pant leg ) has held up beautifully . I really put these pants through the ringer as well , not only for normal classes and training , but also for extra 2-hour drilling sessions that I started doing on Saturdays .

Rolling
As mentioned above , the Rook was a joy to roll in . It will definitely stay in my regular rotation . I had full range of movement , but without giving up a bunch of extra material . The gi top felt very similar in size to my other A3 gis , including my Shoyoroll Americana and Black Eagle . Also , the gi held up really well and did n't come untucked easily , despite liking to wear my belt very low . Also , I did not notice either the jacket or trousers stretch out during rolling despite my partners playing a lot of spider guard and de la riva guard ( which tend to really stretch out sleeves ) .
Conclusion
I own a lot of gis and only a few make it into my regular rotation of 4-5 gis ( which also change depending on time of the year ) . It 's honestly been difficult to not wear the Rook for every class after having worn it for this review . Due to the fit , durability , and style of this gi , I think it is definitely worth the $ 160 price tag . Despite offering pre-orders , CTRL Industries always tries to keep the Rook and their other gis in stock and have sold them on Budovideos in the past .
There are a lot of small gi companies popping up every day and some of their gis are hit or miss . CTRL has been spot on with their gis since day one and the Rook is no exception . I implore you , especially if you are built like I am ( big back , and large thighs ) , to grab one of their gis as soon as possible . Also , if you are my height , but a bit thinner ( read : you can abstain for taco binges , which I ca n't ) , they will likely be offering an A2T size in the future !

Guest Review of CTRL Industries The Rook Gi
by Joshua Barrow ( Thanks again Josh ! )
I got my Gi as a Christmas gift . This was pretty cool as I wanted Ctrl Industries The Rook but did n't know if anyone was ordering it . For Xmas day I opened a box that had a picture of the white competition . So I was n't sure what to expect .
Upon opening the bag , and obviously being excited knowing this is The Rook – the first thing that hit me was the packaging . I have ordered almost every Shoyoroll since batch 6 . I did n't get the yank , but every one since . I can tell you this was the best packaging yet .
Opened the clear snapped bag , and the smell almost choked me . I do n't know what that is , but immediately I thought this was very recently made . I thought this better not be crap .
I grabbed the gi . Pretty heavy feeling . Not weight but just fabric integrity . Seemed a harder thicker fabric . I opened it up went over the stitching . MUCH better than the last three gis I have bought . The seams where the checkerboard is , are clean and strait . This gi is made well . Not thrown together .
I put it on . A little big , but I am slightly too fat these days for my a2h SYR .. So I expected this . No big deal .
I put it on , and was surprised . The top was n't that big , I think a few minutes in a dryer over the course of its life and it will be just like my favorite gi – the koral mkm army green .
I cant wait to train in CTRL Industries The Rook gi . Its been vinegar soaked and washed once . I will retake pics and put them on after just an initial wash to see how it shrank .

A Scottish company has developed a commercial scale method of producing biofuel capable of fuelling cars from the unwanted residue of the whisky fermentation process .
Edinburgh-based Celtic Renewables developed its process of producing biobutanol at industrial scale in Belgium and was recently awarded a £11 million ( $ 16.7 million USD ) grant by the British government to build a bespoke facility of its own in central Scotland .
Professor Martin Tangney founded Celtic Renewables in 2012 as a spin-off company from Edinburgh Napier University . Tangney 's team re-adapted a fermentation process called Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol ( ABE ) originally used 100 years ago , but abandoned due to the cheaper cost of petroleum at the time .
Tangney 's ABE process involves blending pot ale and draff - two residues that make up 90 percent of the distillery output . Draff consists of the sugar rich kernels of barley which are soaked in water to facilitate the whisky fermentation process , while pot ale is a yeast liquid that contains copper and is left over after distillation . Scottish distilleries produce around 750,000 tonnes of draff and two billion litres of pot ale every year .
`` In the production of whisky less than ten percent of what comes out in the distillery is actually the primary product , '' said Tangney . `` The bulk of the remainder are these unwanted residues - pot ale and barley . What we can do is combine these two together , create a brand new raw material , apply a different fermentation technology and convert the residual good material in here into high-value products and in particular this - biobutanol , which is an advanced biofuel which is an exact replacement for petrol or diesel . ''
Until now much of the focus on non-oil based fuel has been on ethanol , which can be produced from plants such as sugar cane or corn . However , ethanol production is controversial , partly because it relies on taking plants out of the food chain . According to Tangney , biobutanol is far more environmentally friendly and also more efficient .
`` Butanol , which is our fuel , is an advanced fuel that 's a four carbon alcohol , so inherently it has more energy , it has almost the same amount of energy as petrol , whereas bioethanol has only got 70 percent of it , '' they said . `` You can store it and pipe it and use the existing infrastructure to distribute this , and in fact you do not need to modify an engine . So this is a genuine like-for-like substitution for oil or diesel - and moreover the fuel is not restricted to automobiles . It 's currently being trialled in shipping industry and is a very good base unit for jet fuel . ''
The biofuel facility in Grangemouth , 25 miles outside of Edinburgh , should be operational by December 2018 . Tangney believes it could produce at least one million litres of biofuel-a-year , a far cry from the company 's early days when they produced batches of five litres in their Edinburgh laboratory .
Tangney says there are huge opportunities for using the ABE technology to produce biobutanol from a variety of spirit drinks .
They told Reuters : `` This is the first of our opportunities and we 're currently working specifically with the malt whisky industry . Then there 's the grain whisky industry , there 's international whisky industries , Ireland - where it all originated - Japan , India , America . There are huge whisky industries all around the world , and then there are related drinks industries . And we 're currently going through a pipeline of research and development where we 're looking at a whole wide variety of unrelated products that will also fit into this , so we 're attempting to tap into regional , national , international resources of low value or unwanted biological material . ''
Tangney insists oil companies should not fear their company 's innovation . `` I see the whole energy thing as a matrix where there will be lots of different renewable energy forms coming in to replace oil , which wo n't happen like-for-like overnight , '' they said . `` For me butanol should be integrated into the existing structure . We have no intention of developing a brand-new infrastructure with our own filling stations and everything . We would bring it in as a blend and distribute it so the consumer sees no difference in their day-to-day activity but they are in fact helping the planet and reducing the amount of oil we consume by putting this into our cars .

Gorsuch , Trump 's pick to fill Antonin Scalia 's seat , is in after a three-day hearing and a debate that included an all-night protest by a Democratic senator
Donald Trump welcomed the first major triumph of their presidency on Friday when the Senate confirmed Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court in an anticlimactic ending to the unprecedented partisan showdown over the vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia .
Gorsuch was approved by a vote of 54 to 45 after a marathon three-day hearing , a floor debate that included an all-night protest by a Democratic senator and a historic rules change that allowed their nomination to go forward on a simple majority . The White House said on Friday that Trump would swear in Gorsuch on Monday morning .
Senate invokes historic 'nuclear option ' rules change to confirm Gorsuch Read more
In a statement on Friday , Trump hailed Gorsuch 's “ historic confirmation ” , the first supreme court appointment of their presidency , and said they were the “ perfect choice ” to serve on the country 's highest court because of their “ his judicial temperament , exceptional intellect , unparalleled integrity , and record of independence ” .
“ As a deep believer in the rule of law , Judge Gorsuch will serve the American people with distinction as they continue to faithfully and vigorously defend our constitution , ” Trump said .
Mike Pence presided over the chamber as senators filed in to cast their votes . In the final tally , three Democrats joined Republicans to confirm Gorsuch : Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota , Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana . One senator , Republican Johnny Isakson of Georgia , did not vote .
The narrow victory , split mostly along party lines , is an illustration of the entrenched political polarization in Washington and an indicator of how future battles over supreme court nominees might be decided . Republicans ' decision to “ go nuclear ” to bypass a Democratic blockade swept away any hope of returning to the recent past , when nominees were largely confirmed with a bipartisan consensus .
Gorsuch is a Colorado native with an Ivy League résumé that includes degrees from Columbia University and Harvard Law School as well as a doctorate from Oxford University , where they studied on a Marshall scholarship . For the past decade , they have served on the 10th circuit court of appeals . They were appointed to that seat in 2005 by George W Bush , and , by contrast , confirmed expeditiously – the Senate approved them on a voice vote with no objections .
At just 49 , the staunch conservative could have a long tenure , though their confirmation restores the ideological tilt of the court , which is often narrowly divided five to four on major decisions .
Gorsuch will replace Scalia , the court 's conservative colossus whose death in February 2016 instantly altered the dynamics of the presidential race . From the bench , Scalia elevated the judicial theory of originalism , to which Gorsuch adheres .
Throughout the campaign , Trump promised to appoint a “ pro-life ” justice to the court . Gorsuch has never ruled directly on abortion and their testimony during the hearing hardly settled the matter . A passage from their book , The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia , indicates “ all human beings are intrinsically valuable ” , adding that “ the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong ” – an assertion many have taken as indicative of their position on abortion .
In their most high-profile decision , Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc v Sebelius , Gorsuch argued that the owners of the multibillion-dollar craft store did not need to comply with a provision of Barack Obama 's healthcare law requiring employers to offer birth control to female employees because it violated their religious beliefs . The decision was upheld , five to four , by the supreme court .
‘ There 's enough blame to go around '
The confirmation of Neil Gorsuch on Friday was the denouement of an extraordinary 14-month drama that played out over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign and into the early months of Trump 's presidency .
It began with the death of Antonin Scalia in February 2016 . Senate Republicans gambled that a lifetime supreme court appointment would mobilize their voters in an unpredictable election year .
They refused to even grant a hearing to Barack Obama 's nominee , Merrick Garland . During an election year , they argued , voters should decide who gets to fill the vacancy on the supreme court . Trump won the election , and Senate Republicans held on to their majority . And on Friday , Gorsuch was confirmed .
Ahead of the vote , the Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , said keeping the seat open was the “ most consequential decision I 've ever been involved with ” .
The blame game reached fever pitch in the run-up to Friday 's vote . Republicans blamed Democrats for firing the first salvo in the “ judicial war ” more than a decade ago , when they attempted to block nominees under George W Bush . McConnell argued that Democrats forced their hand when they mounted an “ unprecedented partisan filibuster ” against a qualified nominee .
Democrats , in turn , blamed Republicans for escalating the fight by refusing to grant Obama 's supreme court nominee a hearing , which some lawmakers have called the “ filibuster of all filibusters ” .
Trump chose Gorsuch from a list of justices vetted by conservative legal groups . Democrats vowed to filibuster what some openly called a “ stolen seat ” .
During Gorsuch 's hearing , Democrats sought to portray Gorsuch as a callous ally of corporate interests who was “ outside the mainstream ” and could not be trusted to stand up to the president who nominated him .
In one instance , Democratic senators hammered Gorsuch over a case in which they ruled that the company was justified in firing a truck driver who abandoned cargo to seek safety after losing feeling in their extremities while awaiting help in subzero temperatures . The majority opinion found the company was not justified in firing the driver , but Gorsuch wrote that the employee was in the wrong .
Republicans described Gorsuch as a brilliant legal scholar whose plain qualifications were being unfairly scrutinized by Democrats .
The more than 20 hours of questioning produced some fireworks . But ultimately , the hearing concluded without exposing any real stumbling blocks to their confirmation .
The hearing ended on a humorous note , with a question from Louisiana senator John Kennedy .
“ You 've never been to Russia , have you ? ” they asked . Gorsuch laughed . “ I 've never been to Russia . ”
Ahead of the vote , the Democratic leader , Chuck Schumer called for a delay in Gorsuch 's confirmation until there was clarity in the FBI 's investigation into potential ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia . They also urged Republicans to pull Gorsuch and find a nominee who would earn the support of 60 senators , enough to overcome a filibuster .
“ They have had other choices , ” the New York democrat said in a floor speech on Thursday . “ They have chosen this one . ”

In the days and hours before the vote , Republican and Democratic senators stood behind the lectern on the chamber floor to lament the entrenched partisanship that led to the historic rules change .
“ Nobody has clean hands completely on this , ” Senator Lindsey Graham , a Republican from South Carolina , conceded in a floor speech on Thursday . In 2005 , Graham joined a bipartisan group of senators to preserve the filibuster , but on Thursday , they joined Republicans in killing it .
“ There 's enough blame to go around on both sides , ” they said .
Senator Jeff Merkley , a Democrat from Oregon , held the floor on Tuesday night to protest Gorsuch 's confirmation . “ I 'm here on the floor at 4:20 in the morning , ” Merkley said , more than nine hours in , “ because so much is at stake . ”
VIENNA ( Reuters ) - A heroin “ epidemic ” is gripping the United States , where cheap supply has helped push the number of users to a 20-year high , increasing drug-related deaths , the United Nations said on Thursday .

According to the U.N. 's World Drug Report 2016 , the number of heroin users in the United States reached around one million in 2014 , almost three times as many as in 2003 . Heroin-related deaths there have increased five-fold since 2000 .
“ There is really a huge epidemic ( of ) heroin in the U.S. , ” said Angela Me , the chief researcher for the report which was released on Thursday .
“ It is the highest definitely in the last 20 years , ” Me said , adding that the trend was continuing .
The rise could be linked to U.S. legislation introduced in recent years which makes it harder to abuse prescription opioids such as oxicodone , a powerful painkiller that can have similar effects to heroin , Me said .
The law meant the texture of the pills was changed to make it more difficult to crush them and inject them into the blood stream , Me said .
“ This has caused a partial shift from the misuse of these prescription opioids to heroin . ”
Another reason for the increase in the use of heroin , which in the United States mainly comes from Mexico and Colombia , is greater supply that has depressed prices in recent years , Me said .
The United States has also seen a spike in deaths related to fentanyl , a synthetic opioid 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times more so than morphine , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Fentanyl has been named as the drug that killed pop singer Prince this year .
At least 207,000 deaths globally were drug-related in 2014 , with heroin use and overdose-related deaths increasing sharply also over the last two years , according to the Vienna-based U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) .
“ Heroin continues to be the drug that kills the most people and this resurgence must be addressed urgently , ” Yury Fedotov , the executive director of the UNODC , said .
U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this year asked Congress for $ 1.1 billion in new funding over two years to expand treatment for users of heroin and prescription painkillers .
Heavy metals from this type of spill can contaminate the bottom of the food chain , environmentalists warn , and can cause harm to other species .
`` Fish eat plankton , fish eat shad , and each time they do that , they obtain just a little bit of the heavy metal into their system , ” said Wayne Gustaveson , a fisheries biologist who studies Lake Powell . “ And it builds up in their system time after they eat many meals . ''
Fragile fish eggs are especially vulnerable to the heavy metals , and chemical damage to DNA can result in harmful mutations . In some parts of the Lake Powell region , which is pockmarked with abandoned mines , runoff from mines has already rendered some streams fishless .
The Utah Department of Health recommended Wednesday that people be cautious around Lake Powell , recommending `` that recreationists on the San Juan River avoid drinking the water and wash after contact with the river as soon as possible , '' a National Parks Service release said .
The extent of the pollution from the spill remains unclear . The EPA has said it will know more about the concentrations of metals in the water by Monday , but a full assessment of the consequences of the spill could take years .
Anderson said a curve in the San Juan River could provide the metals a place to accumulate and eventually spill over into Lake Powell , which straddles the Arizona-Utah border .
`` This flows down the river and will land in the sediment delta in the San Juan arm ” of Lake Powell , Anderson said .
The metals will “ kind of get locked in there , and as the river goes up and down , the river can cut into the sediment and release that stuff back into the lake , ” said Anderson . “ We need some long-term technology and monitoring plan to understand the implications of this over time . ”
Lake Powell is human-made body of water that rose after the damming of the Colorado River , into which the San Juan flows . The spot attracts millions of vacationers , boaters and fishers each year . So far , tourism has n't taken a hit , USA Today reports , but officials have warned visitors not to swim in the San Juan River arm of the lake .
But worries persist .
“ We 've got concerned people in the community , ” said Danny Woods , a fishing guide , told the paper . “ This is our livelihood . This is our drinking water . This is our business . ”
The New England Patriots-Indianapolis Colts rivalry has been highly-publicized since the Tom Brady-Peyton Manning era began . It 's continued to be a must-see matchup since Andrew Luck took the reigns , and the Deflategate proceedings last season added another wrinkle to the bitterness .
Of course , the Colts were the team that outed the Patriots for having underinflated footballs , which obviously did n't sit well with New England .
That was made even more clear at Willie McGinest 's Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony on Wednesday , where owner Robert Kraft threw some shade at the Colts .
Article continues below ...
`` During Willie 's career , there was nothing more satisfying than settling the Colts with a loss — something the Patriots did 16 times in 21 attempts during Willie 's 12 seasons with the Patriots , '' Kraft said .
`` Some of my favorite , most memorable McGinest moments came in regular season clashes against the Colts . In the 2004 season-opener , they preserved a three-point win in the final seconds with a 12-yard sack on Peyton Manning , turning a chip shot , game-tying field goal into 48-yard miss by Mike Vanderjagt . Arguably their most iconic moment came in a game at Indy in 2003 , when they stopped Edgerrin James at the goal line in the last seconds . … As a pass rusher , they had the speed to wreak havoc on a quarterback . Just ask our good friend Peyton Manning . ''
The Colts have n't made their rebuttal public , but they 'll have a good chance to silence the critics in Week 6 when they square off against the Patriots in Indianapolis . That game is slated to be the first of Brady 's 2015 season after sitting out the first four , adding another element to the matchup .

California City . Field Day/YouTube Screenshot California 's two largest cities by area , Los Angeles and San Diego , have beautiful beaches and boast more than a million residents .
California City , which sits in the tumbleweed and dust-filled Mojave desert , is the unexpected third .
Just 14,000 people live in the 203-square-mile city northeast of Los Angeles , as a video from YouTube personality Tom Scott reveals .
A ghostly patch of land , California City signifies the unrealistic ambitions of post-WWII development .
In the late 1940s , California experienced a population boom . Looking to get rich quick , many real estate developers looked West to build new suburbs . Clearing California City 's land for development ironically led to more dust storms , and the suburbs never quite caught on .
`` They built it , and no one came , '' Scott says in the video .
At the peak of postwar development in 1958 , professor-turned-developer Nathan Mendelson bought 82,000 acres of Mojave land . Hoping it would turn into a rival city to LA , Mendelson planned more than 200 square miles of development .
California City 's street names , Cadillac Boulevard , Volvo Drive , and Dodge Street , pay homage to car manufacturers . The city 's center was supposed to be a 160-acre `` Central Park , '' modeled after Manhattan 's famous green space , according to CityLab .
Mendelson sold tens of thousands of plots , but few buyers actually developed their properties . Some who did develop stopped paying their property taxes , and the local government attempted to sell the land to make up for the lost revenue . The imitation `` Central Park '' was eventually completed and filled with a few golf courses .
By the 1970s , only around 7,000 people lived in the city .
Satellite image of California City in the Mojave Desert . Field Day/YouTube Screenshot Today , barely 14,000 people live in California City , most of them housed around Central Park next to unpaved cul-de-sacs . For comparison , around 1.3 million live in California 's second largest city , San Diego .
Over 118,000 acres in California City are undeveloped , according to the Los Angeles Times . The city is one of the state 's smallest by population .
The value of California City land , cursed by a 50-year drought , has stayed down .
My Dear Daughter ( and all other women too ) :
Please do not fall in love with Christian Grey , or anyone like him .
Sure , he 's hot , and , yes , he 's super rich , but you are worth more than a pretty face and a fancy car . Just because they give you butterflies in the stomach when they walk into your place of work , and fixes their stunning eyes at you when they ask you to direct them to the cable ties , does n't mean they love you . Sure , they showed up after you drunk-dialed them from the bar , and they whisked you off to their penthouse after you puked in the flowers , but when a man warns you to stay away from him , you should listen . Especially if their idea of flirtation is threatening to hit you when you do n't want to be hit .
I 'm all for empathy , and compassion . I really am . I believe people deserve second chances . I believe that bad things happen to good people , and that we do n't have any real control over some things . The thing is , my beautiful , sweet , darling girl , that there is no past so troubled ; no history so convoluted ; no dysfunction so incredible that it can explain , or excuse exerting oneself over another . There is no explanation that will ever make me understand or forgive a man ( or woman ) who abuses you .
It is not an expression of love when a man says :
“ Alaska is very cold and no place to run . I would find you . I can track your cell phone–remember ? ' ”
This is , in fact , a direct threat . It does n't mean that they love you so much that they would never let you get away . What it means is they are controlling . It means that they are a stalker , and stalkers are abusers . We 're not talking harmless high school drive-bys with your friends . We 're talking about tracking cell phones in Alaska , and having no where to run . Why else would you be running , if not to get away from someone who was trying to do you harm ?
It 's one thing to hide it from me , even though I truly hope that you will trust me enough to tell me , but if you ca n't tell anyone , you should really consider whether it 's because they wo n't understand , or because you 're afraid they 'd be right . That goes for anything that happens in any relationship . If you actually feel confident in your decisions , you wo n't need validation , and it wo n't matter what anyone says . You should n't do things you are n't proud of doing , or at least things that make you feel ashamed .
“ What can I do to make you understand I will not run ? What can I say ? ” He gazes at me , revealing their fear and anguish again . They swallow . “ There is one thing you can do. ” “ What ? ” I snap. “ Marry me , ” they whisper . ”
You should not agree to marry a man just to prove that you are n't going to leave him , especially if he 's worried you 're going to leave after having beaten you/threatened you/yelled at you/ manipulated you . Marriage is n't an endeavor to prove your love . Marriage is an agreement to join paths ; to be partners ; to grow up together . If a person is worried about your loyalty , marriage will not convince them . It will only serve to entrap you into an abusive relationship that will be even more difficult to escape .
This should not be your lover 's response , let alone your husband 's , to the announcement that you are pregnant .
“ ‘ Christ Ana ! ' They bang their fist on the table . Making me jump , and stands so abruptly . they almost knocks the dining chair over . ‘ You have one thing , one thing to remember , Shit ! I do n't fucking believe it . How could you be so stupid ! ' ”
Even if you forgot about birth control , your husband/lover/wife should never EVER call you stupid , yell at you , or frighten you . In fact , you should n't be worried about making them mad all the time . They should respect you , and be concerned for your well-being . They should not manipulate you , isolate you , and they should certainly not touch you without permission , in ways you do not want to be touched . They should not leave bruises on your body to prevent you from being able to expose any part of your skin . They should not impose themselves on your career . They should not infringe upon your healthy relationships with your friends . They should not hurt you , and no matter how many times they apologize for having done so , you should not tolerate a repeat offense .
I can tell you that love is not about fear . Not in the way the relationship in this horrific excuse for writing is trying to convince you of . Questioning a relationship for reasons like these :
“ Because I ca n't touch you , because I 'm too frightened to show you any affection in case you flinch or tell me off or worse – beat me ? ”
are serious indicators that you are not being loved the way you deserve .
Most importantly , my darling daughter , you have a right to consent to sex . No one…and I mean NO ONE has the right to force sex on you . The moment you say “ No ” , anyone who loves you will stop until you tell them otherwise . This :
“ ‘ No , ' I protest , trying to kick them off . They stop . ‘ If you struggle , I 'll tie your feet too . If you make a noise , Anastasia , I will gag you . ”
is rape , plain and simple . For no other reason , other than the fact that they are a rapist , you should stay away from men like Christian Grey . You do not need to save anyone from their past . After sex you should never feel like :
“ a receptacle – an empty vessel to be filled at their whim . [ … ] an overwhelming urge to cry , a sad and lonely melancholy grips and tightens round my heart . Dashing back to my bedroom , I close the door and lean against it trying to rationalize my feelings . I ca n't . Sliding to the floor , I put my head in my hands as my tears begin to flow . ”
This is how a victim of rape feels . This is how a victim of abuse feels . It is not how you should feel after you 've been intimate with anyone .
There is a variety of erotic practice called BDSM . Some say it stands for Bondage Discipline Sadism & Masochism . Others say it 's Bondage , Dominance , Submission and Masochism . Either way , it is a practice that is entirely based upon a system of consent , open communication , and AGREED upon exchange of power where both parties are empowered . BDSM is not synonymous for abuse , nor is it an excuse for objectification . It is something that should be enjoyed by everyone involved , and not forced upon another person . Anyone who claims BDSM , and tries to hurt you is misappropriating the terminology as an excuse to be abusive . Needing to control another person 's entire life is not love .
I know you 're only a little girl right now , and I 'm hopeful that this movie will be long forgotten by the time you 're old enough to watch it . I know that it 's supposed to be a fantasy , and there are those who will argue that it should n't be taken seriously , and as a book that might hold true , because books have a higher barrier of entry than movies . It 's one thing to read about something . Seeing it played out on a screen makes it harder to separate the fantastic from the realistic . Kind of like the way I 've spent my entire life hearing the stations of the cross , reading the Passion scenes in the Bible , or hearing them discussed from a pulpit , and then just barely being able to tolerate the brutality of it on screen in the movie The Passion of the Christ . The point is that there are people who might watch this movie and think that it 's a love story ; a romance ; because love is enough to change the battered puppy into a loving husband and father . It is n't . It is n't a love story . It 's a story of abuse . It is n't about how love changed a man , because that 's not how it works . Love may be a catalyst , but real change does n't happen overnight . Real change , like the one this novel attempts to depict , takes LOTS of time .
There 's also an entire world of women who were once the five year-old daughters of mothers like me who are paying money to see this movie right now . I see them talking about it on social media , and my heart hurts for them ; for their mothers . I 'm writing this to them , as much as I am to you–probably more so .
If , however , you stumble across it some late night browsing Netflix , or it comes on some movie channel , I truly hope you will see it for the sad cry for help that it is . I hope that you , too , mourn for the author 's horrible controlling experiences that lead to writing such a story , and that you are able to see through it all and see the truth . I admit . I read the books . Twice . I enjoyed them too . That is , until I asked myself how I would feel if that college aged virgin was my daughter , or if it had been successful if it was 50 Shades of Brown . It was instant shame . Instant sadness , because it means that somewhere inside myself I did n't recognize my own value . I pray that you do not devalue yourself this way . I hope that there is no expensive enough car to sway your decisions , and that no man would dare to treat you like a toy . If they do , I 'm only a phone call away , and Daddy will happy to teach them what pain really feels like .
Now , if you do happen to fall in love with a man who sends up any of these red flags , step back . Give them time to get help . Give them time to heal . This may mean saying goodbye , and it may mean forever , and it will likely be painful , for both of you . Remember that anyone who loves you will want to make sure they are healthy enough to know they do n't want to hurt you . They will want to be healthy enough to deserve you . There is no pain worse than losing yourself to another person . You are amazing . You are wonderful . You are valuable . The person who you should be with will know this . The person who is meant for you will not want to get in the way of your emotional health . That person will nourish your soul , and your body…not hurt it . And frankly , if your choice is between being alone and being abused , I 'd rather see you with a black cat than a black eye .
So please , dear daughter ( and all other women too ) , do n't fall in love with Christian Grey , or anyone like him . You are worth so much more than abuse .
With all my Love ,
Mom

? The Hobbit was supposed to start filming this month , but it got pushed back to March 21st so director Peter Jackson could recover from some surgery . But do n't worry — the cast and crew have already assembled in New Zealand , presumably for a bit of pre-production — and some smart chap would want to remind everyone that yes , The Hobbit is really , actually , finally happening this time , and took this pic of Martin Freeman and the 13 men who will be their dwarven company . They 're not in costume or anything , but just seeing all these guys in the same yard together dispels any of the remaining doubts I had about the movie happening . Also , I 'm still freaked out that Aidan Turner ( far left ) is going to play a dwarf , although the way the picture is squished , they do kind of look like Peter Jackson in the old days . Weird . Oh well — unless somebody dies , I think The Hobbit is pretty much set at this point . ( Via /Film )
Attended one of those sessions where the key selling point was “ how to get things done ” . In other words , get your sh * t together and get organized with zero emails in you inbox . It is a whole philosophy , google it : - )
Well one of the suggestions was to use the “ send to onenote ” program that is installed with OneNote . Of course that is way to may click for me and my mouse and I started to look into a quicker way of doing it in powershell , what else ?
Turns out there are very few posts on the subject , sending things from powershell to OneNote . Found a couple of references using c # and that is almost powershell so of I went and created this function Out-Note .
( Out-Note )
The function takes two parameters . Note = The text you want to send to OneNote and an optional parameter Section that defaults to “ General ” .
UPDATE - 23 March 2015
Received a tweet from Jan Egil Ring ( Powershell MVP - @ JanEgilRing ) . They were having issues with the function . It would only create a new page in OneNote if OneNote was NOT running . We tried a couple of things , however the error remained ( New-Object : Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID { DC67E480-C3CB-49F8-8232-60B0C2056C8E } failed due to the following error : 80080005 Server execution failed ( Exception from HRESULT:0x80080005 ( CO_E_SERVER_EXEC_FAILURE ) ) ) . Checking the eventlog we found this message :
The server { DC67E480-C3CB-49F8-8232-60B0C2056C8E } did not register with DCOM within the required timeout .
Well that did not help resolve the issue , however Jan Egil then tried to run the function from an powershell session that was not elevated as an administrator and that worked . So the error above is due to missing cached credentials for your local administrator . To fix it , start OneNote as an administrator ( right-click the icon and choose `` Run as Administrator '' ) and sign in to OneDrive from OneNote .
I have also renamed the function from Send-Note to Out-Note as is a more powershell friendly name ( thank you Jan Egil , I stole the name from you : - ) )
Cheers

`` A lot of the talk around our country is that we have n't developed a true attacking world star . For me , a lot of that comes about because of the way we approach things . We have a mentality in the soccer world in the U.S. where everybody knows more than we do and everybody plays better than we do . And everybody trains better than we do . And it 's just not true , '' Kreis says . `` We need to have more confidence in what we do and that we have guys who can play . And there 's such a mentality that , 'Oh , we do n't have guys who can keep the ball . ' It 's not true . They just need be given the confidence and be put in a structure that allows them to do it .
The prosecution 's case relied heavily on two other deputies who also faced charges for their roles in the beating but struck deals with the government that required them to plead guilty to lesser charges and to testify at trial .
Both men told jurors that Carrillo had been handcuffed throughout the violent encounter , and they detailed how the group of deputies followed Gonzalez 's instructions to justify the violence by framing Carrillo .
Their testimony was a coup for prosecutors , who managed to shatter an unspoken `` code of silence '' that they argued forbids law enforcement officers to out other officers for misconduct .
`` We were all partners , '' one of the now former deputies , Pantamitr Zunggeemoge , testified . `` There 's a bond . And you do n't go against your partners . ''
Jurors said they concluded that Carrillo had been handcuffed after viewing photographs taken the day after the encounter showing dark red abrasions and swelling on both of their wrists .
Gonzalez and two other deputies , Sussie Ayala and Fernando Luviano , were found guilty of using unreasonable force and falsifying records . Ayala and Gonzalez were also convicted of conspiring to deprive Carrillo of their civil rights .
Ayala and Luviano are scheduled to be sentenced later this month .
During the trial , prosecutors accused Gonzalez of boasting about the assault in text messages sent to a deputy who had been involved in the arrest of Carrillo 's brother . The brother had been hospitalized for injuries deputies inflicted during their arrest .
Gonzalez sent a photo of Carrillo 's bloodied , cut face and wrote , `` Looks like we did a better job . Where 's my beer big homie . ''
`` Hahaha , '' the other deputy texted back .
In trying to argue that Gonzalez deserved only two years in prison , their attorney contended Monday that Carrillo owned some responsibility for the beating because of fluttering movements they made with their legs while on the ground and because they turned their head away from the pepper spray . Defense attorneys argued during the trial that the movements were deliberate attempts to kick the deputies and spit blood on them .
The judge gave no credence to the notion .
The eight-year sentence was a few years shorter than prosecutors had requested . Despite their rebukes of Gonzalez , King said they found the guidelines used to calculate the proposed sentence excessive .
Gonzalez showed no emotion Monday when King announced their fate . Avrahamy , their lawyer , made a failed bid to keep Gonzalez free on bond pending an appeal and then asked King to give Gonzalez 60 days of freedom to tie up loose ends in their life .
King rejected the request and ordered Gonzalez taken into custody .
When it comes to sex , the traditional narrative is men expect women to cover their birth control . This is partly due to the fact there are only two available methods for men — a condom or vasectomy — compared to the several methods available for women , from oral contraception , to intrauterine devices and implants , even cervical caps . But as researchers work tirelessly to develop alternative methods for men , they 're noticing how much men 's attitudes have changed .
“ These are n't the men of the 1970s , ” Elaine Lissner , executive director of the Parsemus Foundation , told Medical Daily . “ They 're not our grandfathers , but they 're 20- , 30- , and 40-something-year-old men . They 're the children of baby boomers who need contraception , [ and today ] there 's a lot more openness about sexuality and bodies . ”
Since 2010 , Lissner has been leading a small team working to develop Vasalgel , a non-hormonal polymer gel urologists can inject into the vas deferens ( `` the tube the sperm swim through '' ) after first making a small slit in the scrotal skin . The slit is too small to require stitches , but it 's just big enough to be considered a minor surgical procedure . Urologists , however , do n't take any more time than they would for your standard vasectomy , about 10 minutes ( though Lissner suggests this time depends on who 's performing the procedure ) . In which case , Lissner says Vasagel can basically be described as “ a gel vasectomy . ”
Shutterstock.com
Or rather , a reversible gel vasectomy . Lissner 's team has conducted 12-month studies on rabbits and olive baboons to find not only is this method effective , but a baking soda-type solution could `` flush out '' the gel . So not only is Vasagel the closest to being marketed to men , but it could also leave “ that door cracked open , ” Lissner said .
Vasagel is slated for clinical trials over the next two years for men interested in vasectomy ( as researchers are still in the process of testing reversibility ) . Admittedly , Lissner said this process is more straight forward than your average drug process , so a lot of the continued research depends on public support and finding people who care about and believe male birth control is important .
If all goes according to plan , Vasagel could be on the market by 2018 .
“ You often will hear about male contraceptive being five to 10 years away , which to me means possibly never , ” Lissner said . “ Vasalgel is as soon as three years away . A lot hinges on the reversal studies we 're doing now , because if it 's not reversible , a gel vasectomy is not that exciting ; reversibility is key . ”
Men Are Braver Than We Think
The idea of a vasectomy may be off-putting , but believe it or not , an increasing number of men are opting for the procedure . Lissner cited about half a million men go under the knife each year , and about one in six married men over the age of 35 have already had the procedure done .
The appeal of a vasectomy is its long-term use , much like the IUD for women . People forget things , Lissner said — long-acting birth control offers “ way more in real world use than , say , pills. ” Right now , over 26,000 men are on the mailing list to receive new information on Vasagel 's upcoming clinical trials . Lissner added a similar number of men have already filled out a survey on multi-year male birth control .
These men fall into two groups : The first is men in long-term relationships with partners who have negative experiences with their form of birth control , such as reduced libido and cramps from an IUD . The second , larger group of men are men who are dating and “ do n't want to get a phone call about an ‘ oops , ' ” Lissner explained . These men are interested in having more control of their sexual encounters .
“ It turns out men are braver than we think , ” Lissner said .
Parsemus Foundation
No Side Effects
In the rabbit studies , Vasalgel resulted in azoospermia ( no sperm ) throughout the year-long study , which is also on par with the efficacy of your standard vasectomy . And when vasectomies are done “ by the best ” — a procedure done by a specialist could vary from one done by a general practitioner — Lissner said the rate of effectiveness is “ 99 percent-plus . ”
“ The hope is [ Vasagel wil last ] multiple years , 10 plus , ” they added . “ You could make a rough parallel [ to women ] , saying it 's like a male IUD. ” Among women , the IUDs has become the most popular and effective form of birth control .
Presently there are no side effects . However , Vasalgel is inspired by a similar polymer contraceptive called RISUG , which is in advanced clinical trials in India . And in those trials , some men have experienced testicular swelling . Otherwise Vasagel 's one , potential issue could stem from the following waiting period .
For normal vasectomy , men are asked to wait three months or 20 ejaculations before having sex — “ and that 's when failure happens , ” Lissner said , because men do n't always wait . Yet , having sex too soon keeps alive “ any sperm that were downstream ” during the initial procedure . While Vasagel 's waiting period could be as little as one month , it 'll still determine the gel 's effectiveness .
It Should n't Cost More Than A Flat Screen TV
Easy access to birth control ( all its forms , as well as general information and resources ) remains a prevalent issue for both men and women . Increased access leads to better health outcomes , like a reduced number of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) . In which case , Lissner and their team have kept accessibility in the back of their mind throughout the entire development process .
“ The goal is it should be accessible as far as price , ” they said . “ It should n't cost more than a flat screen TV . If it 's so expensive people ca n't use it , our job is n't done . ''
You might be thinking Vasagel is n't a pill at all , and most headlines have alluded to an actual pill for men to take . While there are real pills ( Lissner is also supporting the team developing the `` clean sheets pill '' ) , other gels , even implants in the works for men , they 're all in the earlier stages of research and development . Vasagel is the closest to being ready to market .
That said , if the multi-year birth control is soon available to men , it does n't mean men ( or women ) should abandon other forms of birth control . Vasalgel does n't protect against STDs and , again , if men do n't wait long enough to have sex after their procedure , there 's still a chance it can fail and result in pregnancy . They are , as most birth control methods are , meant to be a supplement .
As The Telegraph recalls , `` condoms did n't go away after the pill or [ IUDs ] became commonplace . As a barrier method , they will still play an important role against sexually transmitted infections . ''
`` It 's taken longer than we hoped to figure out everything , '' Lissner said . `` We 're a tiny team and we pat ourselves on the back for being alive and kicking . ''
Areas ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union . Porkkala was returned to Finland in 1956 .
The Karelian question or Karelian issue ( Finnish : Karjala-kysymys ) is a dispute in Finnish politics over whether or not to try to regain control over Finnish Karelia and other territories ceded to the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War . Despite the name `` Karelian question '' , the term may refer also to the return of Petsamo , ceded parts of Salla and Kuusamo , and four islands in the Gulf of Finland . Sometimes the phrase `` debate on the return of the ceded territories '' ( luovutettujen alueiden palautuskeskustelu ) is used . The Karelian question remains a matter of public debate rather than a political issue .
History [ edit ]
The Karelian question arose when Finland was forced to cede territories to the Soviet Union after the Winter War in the Moscow peace treaty in 1940 . Most Finnish citizens were evacuated from the ceded areas . Most of them returned during the Continuation War and eventually were evacuated again in 1944 . The Soviet Union insisted the ceded areas be completely evacuated in 10 days . The evacuees were partly compensated for their losses ; farmers , for example , received land in proportion to their earlier holdings . Usually , the compensation was about one third of the original farm . Compensation for movable property was much less . However , all evacuee families had a right to receive a small farm , and/or a plot for a detached house or a flat . The land used for these grants was confiscated by the state from municipalities and private owners . Financial compensation was funded by a general property tax of 10 to 30 % , levied over a period of several years . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Because the vast majority of the evacuees who had to settle in the rest of Finland were from ceded Karelia , the question was labeled The Karelian Question . After the Winter War , Karelian municipalities and parishes established Karjalan Liitto ( the Karelian Association ) to defend the rights of Karelians in Finland .
Evacuees from Muolaa moving towards Western Finland during winter 1940 .
During the Cold War , the Karelian-born Finnish politician Johannes Virolainen lobbied for the return of Karelia . President Urho Kekkonen also tried to reacquire the territory , especially when the Soviet Union returned the peninsula of Porkkala to Finland in 1956 . [ 3 ] There was , however , no significant public controversy about the case , because Kekkonen wanted to keep it quiet . [ 4 ] The last time Kekkonen tried to raise it was in 1972 , but they had no success , and public discussion died out in the 1970s . [ 5 ]
After the breakup of the Soviet Union , the Karelian question re-surfaced . According to an article by the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat in August 2007 , the Russian president Boris Yeltsin unofficially offered to sell ceded Karelia to Finland in 1991 but was declined . [ 6 ] However , according to many Finnish political leaders and the Russian vice Prime Minister of the time , there were no such offers , only unofficial probing of the idea . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Andrei Fyodorov , an advisor of Boris Yeltsin , told the Helsingin Sanomat that they were part of a group that was tasked by the government of Russia in 1991–1992 with calculating the price of returning Karelia to Finland . This price was set at 15 billion US dollars . According to Fyodorov , Finnish president Mauno Koivisto and Finnish foreign minister Paavo Väyrynen were aware of these unofficial discussions . [ 11 ]
Today [ edit ]

Karjalan Liitto is an interest group of Karelian evacuees which hopes that Karelia will once again become part of Finland at some point , but does not openly demand it . Some smaller groups , such as ProKarelia , continue to campaign for the peaceful return of Karelia . However , no serious political party has openly supported this goal , and Finnish politicians generally say there is no need for it , citing Finland 's peace treaty with Russia . There are some individual politicians who support the return of Karelia , such as MEP Ari Vatanen , and two candidates in the presidential election of 2006 : Timo Soini and Arto Lahti . Other candidates have stated that Finland has signed a peace treaty and should not campaign for the return of what are now Russian-developed territories . [ 12 ] During a debate prior to the 2012 presidential election Timo Soini reiterated their view that , if elected , they would advance the issue . [ 13 ]
Official opinions [ edit ]
Both Russia and Finland have repeatedly stated that no open territorial dispute exists between the two countries . Finland 's official stance is that the borders may be changed through peaceful negotiations , although there is currently no need to hold open talks , as Russia has shown no intention of returning the ceded areas , or discussing the question . In 1994 Boris Yeltsin commented that `` seizure of Finnish Karelia '' was an example of Stalin 's totalitarian and aggressive politics . [ 14 ] Later in 1997 they stated that the matter was closed . In 2000 President Putin stated that such discussions may endanger Finnish–Russian relations , and in 2001 they said that `` changing borders is not the best way to resolve problems '' , but that possible solutions would be `` integration and cooperation '' . [ 15 ]
In 1998 Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari said that `` Finland 's official position is that it does not have territorial demands on Russia . However , if Russia wants to discuss returning the ceded areas , Finland is ready for that . `` [ 16 ] Several other politicians holding government office , such as the former foreign minister Erkki Tuomioja and prime minister Matti Vanhanen , have made statements along the same lines . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
Polls and popular opinion [ edit ]
The latest polls show that approximately 26 % to 38 % of Finns would like to see Karelia return to Finnish control and some 51 % to 62 % would oppose such a move . In Russia , people associate the word `` Karelia '' with the Republic of Karelia instead of Finnish Karelia , which makes conducting polls more difficult . In a 1999 poll by MTV3 , 34 % of the people of Vyborg supported returning Karelia to Finland and 57 % were opposed . Vyborg and the rest of the ceded Karelia outside the Republic of Karelia nowadays contain very few ethnic Finns , and is almost exclusively inhabited by people who moved there during the Soviet era and their descendants .
In the latest poll in Finland about the question , 36 percent of Finns supported the return of ceded territories , compared to 51 % who are opposed . The poll was conducted by the newspaper Karjala and the research institute MC-Info Oy on 13 October 2005 . In August 2005 , a poll by Helsingin Sanomat and Suomen Gallup , determined that 30 % of Finns supported and 62 % opposed the return . [ 19 ] In a poll by Taloustutkimus and Karjalan Liitto conducted in May 2005 , support was 26 % while 58 % were opposed . [ 20 ] A year earlier , a poll by STT showed 38 % supporting and 57 % opposing . A poll by Taloustutkimus was criticized by ProKarelia for asking leading questions , such as , `` Do you support the return of Karelia , even if it would mean more tense relations or even war with Russia ? `` [ 21 ] 5 % of supporters and of those who declined to respond supported the return even under these circumstances ( 2.1 % of all replies ) . [ 22 ]
Many of the people who were born in Karelia and were evacuated want Karelia to become part of Finland . According to polls , older people ( ages 65 and up ) and young people ( 15-25 ) support the idea more strongly than the generation of their parents ( 25–65 ) who grew up during the Cold War . [ 19 ] Former President Mauno Koivisto was against a discussion about the question . [ 23 ] Support for regaining the ceded areas is also strong among minor nationalist right-wing groups .
Problems and arguments [ edit ]
Price [ edit ]

One of the main reasons for opposing the return is the fear of the costs it would bring . According to another poll conducted by Helsingin Sanomat , 42 % of Finns opposing the return list that as the most important single reason . The standard of living on the Russian side of the border is much lower than on the Finnish side . The GDP ( PPP ) per capita in Finland is about double that of Russia .
The costs of bringing Karelia to the same level with the rest of Finland have been researched only by supporters of the idea . According to a survey conducted by ProKarelia , the area has natural advantages that , under Finnish rule , would make it a centre of trade with Russia and industry and thus bring economic growth fast enough to solve the entire problem . According to both ProKarelian research and Arto Lahti 's estimate , the price of return would be about 30 billion euro . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ]
Population [ edit ]

The area is inhabited mostly by people who moved there from Ukraine , Belarus and Russia , and their descendants . The fate of these people is a major issue in discussions of the return of Karelia to Finland . According to the poll by Helsingin Sanomat , 14 % of people opposing return consider its greatest flaw the tensions that would be caused by a Russian-speaking minority being formed in Finland . In 2004 , there were about 370,000 Russians living in the region . [ 27 ]
If the inhabitants were allowed to stay in their homes , Finland would receive a few hundred thousand new Russian-speaking people with no experience of living in Finnish society . If services for them in their own language were to be provided , Finland would need many more officials capable of speaking Russian . In ProKarelia 's vision , nearly half of the Russian population in Karelia would be expelled to Russia , and even more would leave if Finland paid their expenses for doing so . [ 24 ] However most of the Russian speaking population of Karelia were born there and have spent all their life in the region .

Finnish only :
There are several varieties of bezoar , some of which have inorganic constituents and others organic . The term has both a modern ( medical , scientific ) and a traditional usage .
A bezoar is a mass found trapped in the gastrointestinal system , [ 2 ] though it can occur in other locations . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] A pseudobezoar is an indigestible object introduced intentionally into the digestive system . [ 5 ]
Bezoars had value because they were believed to have the power of a universal antidote against any poison . Tradition held that a drinking glass which contained a bezoar would neutralize any poison poured into it . The word `` bezoar '' comes from the Persian pād-zahr ( پادزهر ) , which literally means `` antidote . `` [ 13 ]
The Andalusian physician Ibn Zuhr ( d. 1161 ) , known in the West as Avenzoar , is thought [ by whom ? ] to have made the earliest description of bezoar stones as medicinal items . [ 14 ] Extensive reference to bezoars also appears in the Picatrix , which may have originated earlier .
In 1575 , French surgeon Ambroise Paré described an experiment to test the properties of the bezoar stone . At the time , the bezoar stone was deemed able to cure the effects of any poison , but Paré believed this was impossible . It happened that a cook at King 's court was caught stealing fine silver cutlery and was sentenced to death by hanging . The cook agreed to be poisoned instead . Ambroise Paré then used the bezoar stone to no great avail , as the cook died in agony seven hours after taking poison . [ 15 ] Paré had proved that the bezoar stone could not cure all poisons , contrary to popular belief at the time .
Modern examinations of the properties of bezoars by Gustaf Arrhenius and Andrew A. Benson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography have shown that they could , when immersed in an arsenic-laced solution , remove the poison . The toxic compounds in arsenic are arsenate and arsenite . Each is acted upon differently , but effectively , by bezoar stones . Arsenate is removed by being exchanged for phosphate in the mineral brushite , a crystalline structure found in the stones . Arsenite is found to bond to sulfur compounds in the protein of degraded hair , which is a key component in bezoars . [ 16 ]
A famous case in the common law of England ( Chandelor v Lopus , 79 Eng Rep. 3 , Cro . Jac . 4 , Eng . Ct. Exch . 1603 ) announced the rule of caveat emptor ( `` let the buyer beware '' ) if the goods they purchased are not in fact genuine and effective . The case concerned a purchaser who sued for the return of the purchase price of an allegedly fraudulent bezoar . ( The law report does not discuss how the plaintiff discovered that the bezoar did not work . )
Bezoars were important objects in cabinets of curiosity and natural history collections , especially for their use in early modern pharmacy and the study of animal health . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy notes that consumption of unripened persimmons has been identified as causing epidemics of intestinal bezoars , and that up to 90 % of bezoars that occur from eating too much of the fruit require surgery for removal . [ 19 ]
A 2012 study recorded that a patient with a standard gastric bezoar was treated successfully with 2 weeks of administered Traditional Chinese Medicine , after which the stone was dissolved with no adverse side effects . [ 20 ]
A 2013 review of three databases identified 24 publications presenting 46 patients treated with Coca-Cola for phytobezoars . The cola was administered in doses of 500 mL to up to 3000 mL over 24 hours , orally or by gastric lavage . A total of 91.3 % of patients had complete resolution after treatment with Coca-Cola : 50 % after a single treatment , others requiring the cola plus endoscopic removal . Doctors resorted to surgical removal in four cases . [ 21 ]
Airborne troops from Russia and the Untied States would hold joint anti-terror drills in the U.S. state of Colorado between May 24 and 31 , spokesperson of the Russian Defense Ministry Col. Alexander Kucherenko said on Thursday .
According to the spokesperson , it will be the first time that the Russian airborne forces have held exercises with the U.S. airborne forces on the U.S. territory .
`` According to the exercise scenario , soldiers of the two countries will hold a tactical airborne operation , including the reconnaissance of imaginary terrorists ' camp and a raid , '' Kucherenko said .
`` After the operation , a helicopter will evacuate the soldiers , '' Kucherenko said , adding that the Russian soldiers will also exercise with the U.S. special service weapons in the drills in Fort Carson , Colorado .
Besides , the spokesperson said , the Russian group will arrive a week ahead of the drills and attend a baseball game in the city of Colorado Springs .

Norway 's recent decision to tighten asylum policies in order to bring down the number of refugees seems to be in tune with popular sentiment , a new poll shows .
In a matter of just five months , Norwegians appear to have largely reversed their outlook on accepting refugees . In a poll conducted by Ipsos MMI and published on Saturday , 42 percent of respondents said that Norway should accept fewer refugees , 25 percent said the numbers should n't raise from the current level and 28 percent thought the Nordic country should take in more refugees .
A similar poll carried out in June showed nearly the opposite , with 42 percent advocating for more refugees and 31 percent saying there should be fewer let in to Norway .
PM Erna Solberg told Dagbladet that they are in agreement with the Norwegians that there are too many refugees currently seeking out the country .
“ It is important that we try to limit the number of groundless asylum applications . It is in the best interests of Norwegian society , the ability to successfully integrate and for those people who have a genuine need for protection , ” they said .

Under the deal , the government will reduce asylum seekers ' social benefits , putting them on a par with levels in neighbouring Nordic countries to make Norway less attractive , and speed up the processing of some cases and the expulsion of rejected asylum seekers .
It will also limit access to permanent residency , and make it harder to qualify for family reunifications .
Norway , a member of the Schengen area of free movement even though it is not a member of the European Union , has also increasingly used media channels to discourage new arrivals , in particular the growing number of migrants arriving via the Arctic route across northern Russia
Solberg said they have consistently pushed for policies that will result in fewer asylum seekers .
“ I have n't been in a competition on who can take in the most refugees . I have been very clear that invitational signals would be a challenge for Norway as a nation and therefore I have been very reserved , ” they told Dagbladet .
Since the beginning of the year , 29,000 people have sought asylum in Norway , a country of 5.2 million , including 2,500 people in the past week alone .

Virtus.pro have issued a statement reminding that the members of their CS : GO squad are still tied to the organisation .
Earlier on Thursday , Virtus.pro formally announced that they had closed down their CS : GO division , revealing that the players `` were not fulfilling their obligations '' towards the organisation .
It was also stated that Virtus.pro were considering sanctions for the players , who are legally bound to the organisation until the end of the year .
In a new statement , Virtus.pro have now accused the players of trying to `` blackmail '' the organisation with `` unsatisfying conditions '' only to play in a new team with Yegor `` markeloff '' Markelov , who has departed Natus Vincere .
`` We are waiting for Virtus.pro and Na´Vi organisations to further comment on this matter , '' Virtus.pro wrote on their website . `` We want to stress the fact that VP 's players have signed their contracts until the end of the year and now they are leaving autocratically , blackmailing us with unsatisfying conditions . `` Considering not only their misbehavior and devil-may-care attitude , but also potential involvement of a Na ` Vi player in a newly-built roster , we decided not to take part in this inadmissible dialogue which led to team 's dismissal . `` At this moment , we can see that these players , who have been provided with paid LAN trips for the whole year and a modern training center with all needed help , have left the project for a few hundred dollars just because they want to play with Yegor Markelov . ''

During the spring of 1994 , Americans were gripped by an incident in Singapore which unexpectedly became a cause celebre : the caning of Michael Fay , who was sentenced for their role in vandalizing property in Singapore . The sentence caused outrage in the United States and even President Bill Clinton became involved in the court proceedings . The seemingly minor incident became such an issue that it threatened to derail the normally friendly bilateral relationship . The Singaporean government eventually lowered the penalty to four lashes from six ; the caning was administered on May 5 , 1994 .
William Butcher served as Director of the Office of the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia , Brunei , and Singapore ( PIMBS ) from 1993-1995 , and had to deal with the fall out of Michael Fay 's case . Aloysius O'Neill served as Deputy Director of the PIMBS Office from 1993-1994 , during which time they worked to deal with the publicity surrounding the upcoming caning of young Mr. Fay . Butcher was interviewed by David Reuther beginning in December 2010 . O'Neill was interviewed by Charles Stuart Kennedy , beginning in August 2008 .

“ Caning is not just giving kids a spanking ”
William Butcher , Director of the Office of the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia , Brunei , and Singapore ( PIMBS ) , 1993-1995
BUTCHER : Singapore was a very interesting situation because one of my worst crises in a sense was the famous Michael Fay canning case . This was bubbling along . On one occasion when I was going to some meetings at the UN , I was walking down a street near the UN and I hear out of a boom box some morning DJ saying something like , “ And how is your butt this morning , Michael Fay ? ”
You know you are in trouble when your country is being mentioned over a boom box in downtown New York .
It became quite an issue . The Singaporeans , with whom we had a very good relationship over many years , valued both our economic and our military support and presence and I think they were increasingly concerned with their own restive youth .
They had a vandalism case . Someone spray painted a judge 's personal car . They round up the usual suspects . They got a number of kids at the international school and frankly , there was no real evidence from the information we had that these were the kids who were involved , who were the perpetrators in this specific instance . They were people who had rap sheets in a sense from other activities at school or elsewhere . There were real concerns about this .
Caning is not just giving kids a spanking . When you talk about caning , this is something the British had as an option in the old days . You can have the cat-of-nine-tails or the rattan , the caning . It involves a strip of rattan dipped in water that flays the flesh . Strokes crisscross , and at a certain point chunks of flesh can fly . It is pretty nasty stuff . It is very strong corporal punishment .
The Singaporeans seemed absolutely askance that we even cared about this issue . We cared because : a ) it was an American citizen ; and b ) this was a minor in our standards – the damage – spray painting of a private vehicle — was not permanent . They were a school student and we were not sure that they had had a fair hearing . There was some evidence to the contrary .
“ This guy kept demanding that the U.S. government send a Special Forces team to rescue Michael Fay from prison ”
Aloysius O'Neill , Deputy Director , PIMBS Office , 1993-1994
O'NEILL : What distinguished this particular case was that what we normally refer to as vandalism such as spray painting a car or spraying graffiti on a building , is known as “ mischief ” in Singapore law . You can be fined for it , you can be imprisoned for it , but you ca n't be caned for mischief whereas the crime of “ vandalism ” in Singapore law had a political connotation .
Just spray painting your name on somebody 's car was mischief in Singapore law . If you spray painted “ Down with Lee Kuan Yew , ” on the other side of the same car that was vandalism because there was a political message . You could be caned if you were convicted of vandalism , and this was being beaten on the bare buttocks with a stout rattan cane .
When those students were arrested , I do n't really think there was any doubt that Michael Fay and their fellow students were spray painting cars out of sheer boredom or whatever was motivating them . There was no political message in any of this spray painting , but they were arrested by the cops and probably vigorously interrogated . One of the Malaysian boys had a burst eardrum out of the interrogations….Michael Fay was sentenced to six strokes of the cane . This caused a big uproar and actually got a lot of attention in the American press .
This got to be a real tangle because among other things our fellow Americans in some numbers were calling and writing to the Singapore embassy in Washington threatening all sorts of violence . My Singapore/Brunei desk officer was a crackerjack FSO [ Foreign Service Officer ] named Nan Nida , now Nan Fife . Nan got a stream of diplomatic notes from the Singapore embassy with attachments which were the transcripts of all the obscene and threatening phone calls . They were requesting additional diplomatic security around the embassy which we arranged very quickly . One note after another would come in with these filthy , obscene phone call transcripts attached to them with all sorts of bloodcurdling threats against the embassy .
Meanwhile , we were getting phone calls , too . One person who was calling during this time was a professor at some college somewhere in the U.S. , and I wound up handling their calls . I tried to keep Nan from having to deal with too many of the wacky callers because they had too many other things to do .
But this guy kept demanding over and over again that the U.S. government send a Special Forces team to rescue Michael Fay from the Singapore prison where they were awaiting caning . I was gritting my teeth and saying we 're not going to do that and trying to get them off the phone as quickly as I could . All the while I thought that I 'll just bet that during the Vietnam War , this guy was probably a vociferous critic of the U.S. military and Special Forces as baby killing rapists but by God , they now wanted the Green Berets to rescue Michael Fay… .
Well , there were several different currents in the United States because there was this backlash ( no pun intended ) . Whether it was racist or not , I do n't know , but the idea of corporal punishment , of caning an American student did n't sit well with certain Americans .
On the other hand there were others including , at least one member of the Maryland House of Delegates , who wanted to allow for caning in the Maryland school system . And we got more than a few calls saying “ right on , Singapore . That 's a good way to stop vandalism. ” So there were various currents in the U.S . It was n't all one-sided by any means . The opponents were the ones harassing the Singapore embassy .
“ 'Kill the chicken to scare the monkey ' ”
The weirdest twist was that after Fay had been convicted of the political charge of vandalism and was sentenced to six strokes of the cane ; there was a news conference at the White House . It was a Friday , and President Clinton was with a visiting prime minister or president . One of the newsmen asked what about the Michael Fay case and this kid being caned . Clinton said they did n't know anything about it or did n't know the details , but they would get back to the reporter which , of course , sent the NSC staff into a swoon as well as us , because the last thing we needed was presidential involvement in a case like this .
Well , on the following Monday or Tuesday Clinton had another news conference . Nobody asked a question about Fay , but Clinton then said somebody had asked about the Michael Fay case on Friday and they had looked into it . They said it was really bad .
We and the NSC [ National Security Council ] went into a swoon again because then what do you do ? You 've got Bill Clinton vs. [ former Prime Minister , then Senior Minister ] Lee Kuan Yew and Lee had the home court advantage , so to speak . I 'm not sure that we ever knew for sure exactly what the Singapore government 's thought processes were in prosecuting the boys for vandalism , but our embassy 's best analysis was that Lee Kuan Yew was sending a very Chinese message to Singapore 's own students .
There 's a Chinese expression , “ Kill the chicken to scare the monkey , ” and this may have been what they had in mind — that there was sort of unrest of some kind , or at least unrest by Lee Kuan Yew 's very narrow definition of it , anyway , among Singapore students . What better way of showing Singapore students that they better stay in line than to whack some Malaysian and American kids for having spray painted some cars and gotten out of line .
Anyway , now the President of the United States had interjected themselves into a situation which was from my narrow low-level perspective very non-presidential . But there we were , and in the end what the Singapore government did reduce the sentence from six strokes to four , as a result of presidential intervention but the kid still got caned . There was no way that I can imagine somebody like Lee Kuan Yew backing down and saying , “ Well , thank you . We 'll just sentence them to a rap on the knuckles. ” They just would n't do that , but they did reduce the sentence which may have given somebody some satisfaction .
This case , as such things always do , brought some real wackos out of the woodwork….We were of course in touch with Michael Fay 's father , a long time business representative in Singapore which is how their son got to be there . My recollection is that they and Michael Fay 's mother were divorced . Mr. Fay kept calling us , not surprisingly , wanting us to stop the caning . Then one time they told us somebody had sent them a letter or an e-mail detailing in a very sadistic fashion what caning was like . The sender was an American as far as I know who took it upon themselves to tell Mr. Fay about just how horrendous and painful and it was going to be for their son . So they were calling us about this , too .
It was just a really messy , miserable case . Michael Fay did , indeed , get their four strokes , and that was more or less the end of it . But the case was one of the more unusual things that I dealt with in my Washington days .
When you think of collectable card games ( CCGs ) , the likes of Hearthstone and Magic : The Gathering probably spring to mind , and quite rightly so .
Both have player bases exceeding 20 million and a thriving competitive scene . That 's not mentioning their long service to the community , with Magic over two decades old . Let 's face it , they are the veterans of CCGs .
But we should also consider the new guys .
Another round of Gwent ?
Gwent : The Witcher Card Game was born as a mini-game within The Witcher 3 , CD Projekt Red 's Game of the Year-winning RPG . Players could collect the in-game characters ' in-card form and battle it out in taverns , dark forests and even high stakes tournaments .
Fans were overwhelmed by the RPG 's quirky mini-game and the developers soon received an avalanche of requests to make it a standalone game that were impossible to ignore .
It 's officially been a year since Gwent : The Witcher Card Game first went into beta , inviting hundreds of players to test what would be a standalone version of the The Witcher 3 's much loved mini-game .
Since then , thousands of CCG enthusiasts have flocked to the game – with many popular Hearthstone players such as Lifecoach and SuperJJ – defecting to what was fast becoming a unique , exciting strategy game . Its success was recently recognised at the Global Game Awards , where it won the title for Best Free-to-Play game .
`` Gwentslam # 1 was won by the British player Freddybabes , who qualified online . Not only that , but this also earned them the crown points to qualify for Gwent Open # 2 , which they also won . ''
CDPR have used the money earned from the success of The Witcher 3 to promote their new CCG well , selling it with the slogan 'Fresh Meta , No Mana ' , which has caught the attention of many players .
It 's one of the few card games on the market that does n't have a mana system . Therefore , if you want to play your legendaries first , you 're more than welcome to do so . There 's no waiting seven turns to establish land or power in Gwent ; your entire hand is open from the off .
After the success of Gwent Challenger , CDPR 's first official Gwent tournament , the community were crying out for the game to become an esport . So CDPR created the Gwent Masters series and the Pro Ladder .
In order to qualify , players need to have reached Rank 21 by the end of the season . They are then rewarded with a separate ladder where players can earn Crown Points , used to enter official Gwent Masters tournaments .
The Pro Ladder forces competitors to play a wide variety of factions , eliminating the ability to spam a deck they 're most comfortable with .
Thanks to the addition of Strivewire sponsored qualifier tournaments , we 've also seen players who do n't have time for ladder grinding emerge victorious in various events .
Gwentslam # 1 , a Lifecoach hosted tournament , was won by the British player Freddybabes who qualified online . Not only that , but this also earned them the crown points to qualify for Gwent Open # 2 , which they also won .
While we welcome the diverse , multicultural field , it 's nice to see homegrown talent doing so well . And , with Gwent Challenger # 2 later this year – not to mention the various tournaments in 2018 – the Gwent Masters title could be going to anyone , including new players . Hint , hint .
Gwent and UK esports
Since most tournaments are run by CD Projekt Red and Lifecoach , they are usually held in either Austria or Poland , but it 's not rare to see UK faces at the top of the Gwent scene .
Aside from the asupervisorstioned UK champion Freddybabes ( shown winning the Gwentslam grand final below ) , what other notable Gwent names are from the UK ?
The official Gwent Masters series is co-casted by Connagh “ Merchant ” Hawkins , a regular Twitch streamer and veteran YouTuber based in Cambridge . With over 30,000 subscribers , they played in the Gwentlemen Invitational alongside teammates Petrify and Truedawn and co-hosts the Tier 2 podcast , a weekly talk show for Gwent .
Known for their 'spicy ' memes , he 's admired by many in the community – even if they pretend otherwise – and recently announced plans to set up a UK Gwent event . They urge those interested in being a part of it to contact them via their Twitter page .
Venture to Scotland and you 'll find Stephen “ crokeyz ” Croke , a regular Twitch streamer and former winner of the Gwentlemen Open , one of Gwent 's biggest online tournaments that 's open to everyone . They are often one of the first Gwent streamers to go live every morning , warming up the viewers for their international peers .
A popular face within the community , “ AshCosplay ” is a British streamer and the host of A Round of Gwent , CDPR 's official talk show . They are also a talented cosplayer , regularly bringing characters from the Witcher universe to life , and also hosts Lifecoach 's Gwentslam series .
Battle for the Eternal throne
While it was released roughly the same time as Gwent , Eternal Card Game has slipped under the radar . Created by a team of professional Magic players for Dire Wolf Digital , Eternal is a mana-based CCG that plays like a fun blend of Hearthstone and Magic .
It fuses the many possibilities of a hardcore strategy game alongside the polish and speed of its contemporary counterparts .
Just like Gwent , it utilises five different factions but lets the player roam free with deck building . If you want a Time legendary in your Primal hybrid deck , go ahead . It 's clear the team at Dire Wolf Digital want the players to have as much choice as possible .
`` While it does n't have much of a competitive scene , there are regular small-ball tournaments with a decent cash prize for the top scoring players . ''
Eternal is still in closed beta but that has n't stopped it from receiving expansions along with new awards and cards . The Dusk Road has also just been teased , which promises to add new in-game mechanics as well as a story mode that follows up its last 23-mission expansion , The Tale of Horus Traver .
While it does n't have much of a competitive scene , there are regular small-ball tournaments with a decent cash prize for the top scoring players . The next one will be held mid-December and is open to registration here .
Eternal is available to download on Steam and also mobile . Similar to Hearthstone , players can sync their PC accounts with their phone and continue playing when away from home . Say goodbye to your productivity .
Despite its niche audience , Eternal 's community is growing every day and , with the new expansion coming soon , we hope to see some UK faces reveal themselves .
On Last Week Tonight , John Oliver did an entire segment about conspiracy theorist Alex Jones . But rather than delve into Jones ' awful comments about Sandy Hook , which many media outlets have already done , they focused on the pseudo-scientific products that Jones sells on their radio show , Jones ' claim that the money they make from those products barely covers the cost of their media empire , and the “ MIT alumni ” who endorses these products on air .
The whole segment gives you even more reasons to despise Alex Jones . Not that you needed them . ( By extension , you should n't buy products from Gwyneth Paltrow ‘ s Goop , either . )
One criticism , though . Around the 17:00 mark , there 's a clip showing Jones talking about how they dress well — like a “ Satanist ” — in order to “ enter their world ” and pop the bubble from the inside . Oliver responds to that comment with this : “ Tormenting the parents of Sandy Hook should comfortably get you into the Satanic Club . ”
Hey now . I know a lot of Satanists and they want nothing to do with Alex Jones .
Unlike him , they have morals .
Peter H. Gilmore , the high priest of the Church of Satan , was n't thrilled with Jones ' remark either , telling me via email :
The fact that Jones dons a blue sports jacket and a Rolex , which they equate with the values of human prosperity and empowerment — actual Satanic values — to infiltrate and expose us is laughable . We certainly appreciate bespoke suits and finely crafted accessories , but Jones is going to need more than those trinkets to “ enter our world. ” Fundamentalist Christian hucksters like Jones always prey on the fears of their followers by providing scapegoats , so we are n't surprised that they preach an anti-life morality to personally profit off those gullible enough to buy into their irrational conspiracy theories .
If Alex Jones were indeed a Satanist , he 'd be a much better human being .
* * * Update * * * : Lucien Greaves of The Satanic Temple added in an email :
Personally , I doubt anybody has a more deeply-rooted disgust and loathing for the foul , idiotic , crass ranting buffoon played by Alex Jones on their mentally deranged InfoWars broadcasts than myself . While The Satanic Temple does n't dictate political party affiliation to its membership , and we embrace a wide spectrum of individuals of a diversity of opinions and persuasions , I like to think that our membership has no overlap at all with the bitter , ignorant and appallingly gullible Alex Jones market . If Alex Jones were to apply for membership in the “ Satanic Club ” of The Satanic Temple , I think that the most polite rejection reply I could muster for them is , “ go fuck yourself. ” I hope Oliver 's piece on Alex Jones is but the beginning of a sustained and crushing public shaming of Jones and their malicious band of conspiracist slobs .
Greaves added that the Temple 's Grey Faction is actively fighting against the sort of “ harmful lunacy ” endorsed by Jones .
I was a little skeptical going in of buying five episodes in advance and only getting one at a time as they came out . But , I was very pleased with the quality of the game . It will be a bit awkward for those of you who are into games like resident evil and silent hill , but it 's not that type of game anyway . The characters are much more realistic and the story darker . If you read the comics , you should be more than pleased with this adaptation that draws on characters from there , as well as a bunch of new characters , and even gives you some background story on some of them . Glenn was in the first episode before they go back to Atlanta and meets up with the others . But I think one of the biggest things that separates this from other games is how much you affect the storyline with the choices you make . The others learn and adapt to those decisions , and while you build friendships with some , you will be making enemies of others . And who knows in life or death post zombie apocalypse situations , which of them you just may need to rely on later , or who you may need that you let die earlier on . At the time of writing this , I am still waiting for episode two which is set to come out later this month , but if it is as good as episode one , it 's well worth the wait . I found the controls to be a bit odd , being used to both first and third person full roaming games , but that awkwardness , getting used to the controls , made those sudden moments where a decision needed to be made , or action was called for , all that much more tense . With only seconds to spare you will fight to the death with zombies , and make critical life changing ( or ending ) decisions . And those decisions will matter a great deal in later episodes and sometimes within minutes of making them . This is an awesome adventure for anyone into this type of storyline , especially fans of the comic that want a new and interesting tale set in the same world as The Walking Dead comic and even intersecting the stories of some of the characters from that before we saw them there . You definitely wo n't be sorry that you spent the money .
[ PATCHED ] Forever Thankful on FB —Using React to bring the Thankful Reaction back to Facebook 🌸
Alec Garcia Blocked Unblock Follow May 18 , 2017
EDIT : A few hours after the release of my extension on Product Hunt , Facebook has patched this from the server side . It was fun while it lasted . GG , FB .
Facebook brought back its limited edition ‘ Thankful ' Reaction so people could show their thanks and appreciation during Mother 's Day this year . People were expressing they gratitude with bouquets of flowers left and right , and everything was a floral bliss .
But then came the fateful moment when Mark Zuckerberg took the gratitude from under our feet and left us broken . The flower is gone again and people are freaking TF out . — Shandukani Mulaudzi
Just because Mother 's Day is over does n't mean we ca n't show our gratitude to others . Every day is a day for thanks . I decided I wanted to restore humanity and bring back the Thankful Reaction .
The only possible way to bring back the Reaction that was so suddenly stolen from us is by harnessing the power of browser extensions . With my experience in React and building Google Chrome extensions ( e.g . my Chrome IG Story extension with 370k+ users ) I was able to reverse engineer the Facebook Reactions React components ( FB is powered by its own React framework ) and bring the withered flower back .
How did I do it ? Well , I must give a shout-out to Alexandre Kirszenberg for their excellent blog post that details how to inspect and hook into React components . They ended up getting a Cease & Desist letter from Facebook though , so hopefully my fate is n't similar . I just want to spread thanks y'all .
I started by inspecting the Reactions menu popup that appears when you hover your mouse over the Like button .
Inspecting the Facebook Reactions menu with React Developer Tools
As you can see from the screenshot above , on the right side , ‘ UFIReactionsMenuImpl.react ' is one of the main components that handles the Reactions-interactions . If you look closely , you can see that one of the props is an array called supportedReactions . Bingo . From here I figured out that the numbers map to the Reaction 's type ID . 1 is ‘ Like ' , 2 is ‘ Love ' , etc . The last ID is 8 , but what happens if it 's changed to something else ?
Modifying the props of the component allows us to dynamically change its behavior with little effort
After incrementing the number , I finally got what I was looking for when I reached 11 . The beauty of editing the props in React Dev Tools is that once you update it , it propagates to the state and everything works as expected . It 's not like you 're just editing some HTML in the DOM and then have to change some JS logic . By simply changing the last index 's ID from 8 to 11 , the Angry Reaction turned into a Thankful Reaction , and when you click it , it actually submits it to the server and sticks . Facebook 's server is n't verifying that the Reaction type ID you are sending is no longer available , so you 're free to thank and be thanked .
If you 're curious to what Facebook is up to , like I was , I experimented with some other IDs . There are a few other hidden Reactions that you can uncover with this technique , however Facebook is actually verifying these requests and blocks the request if you try to submit it .
Through my experimentation , I found 5 hidden Facebook Reactions : Yay , Confused , Selfie , Fire , and… Airplane ? The only ones that had an icon were Fire and Airplane .
Hidden ‘ Selfie ' Reaction with a missing icon
Hidden ‘ Like ' Reaction with a Fire icon
Hidden ‘ Like ' Reaction with an Airplane icon
Now , I knew I could post Thankful Reactions myself by manually editing the React component , but would I be able to build a product that others could use to do the same ? 🤔
Using the techniques described in the blog post referenced earlier , I started to work on a Chrome extension that could enable Thankful Reactions for the masses .
Now , it actually took a while to reverse engineer and trace the component tree to find exactly where I could hook into , intercept , and modify the supportedReactions array programmatically , but eventually I found that everything I needed lived in 2 components called ‘ UFICentralUpdates ' and ‘ UFIFeedbackTargets ' .
Using the ‘ requireLazy ' module exposed on the window object on Facebook , I could require those two components and use their methods .
The sight of a callback being registered is surely a sign of an easy in to hook and mutate data
Inside UFIFeedbackTargets I saw that it was subscribing to an event called ‘ update-feedback ' which is called once the server responds with an object that so happens to contain the supportedReactions array . If I hook into this subscription , I can know exactly when I get the supportedReactions array and I could mutate it by appending our Thankful Reaction ID . The only question now was , after mutating it , how do I get it to propagate and actually reflect in the React app ?
Once you 've hooked into a callback , it 's time to broadcast your changes .
Inside UFICentralUpdates I saw that the same event I just subscribed to , ‘ update-feedback ' was being emitted by an ‘ inform ' method . This is the final step . From the callback I subscribed to , I can retrieve the supportedReactions array , append ‘ 11 ' to it , and broadcast the new object with the modified array . Now , since the code is both subscribing to and emitting the same event , we need to prevent an infinite callback loop . My logic was to simply check the size of the supportedReactions array when we receive it . If its size is 6 , which is the current number of default Reactions , we append our new Thankful Reaction and emit it . The callback will again receive the array , but this time its size is 7 , so we do n't emit anything . Once that event is emitted , React operates as usual and accepts our new props and now renders our beautiful floral Thankful Reaction . 😀
Temporary Reactions can be fun but I really implore Facebook to offically bring back the Thankful Reaction . All things in life are temporary and it 's not until we lose the things that are important to us that we realize how much we truly appreciated them . It 's good to express our gratitude and let those we love to know how much we care . Be Forever Thankful , on Facebook , and everywhere else . Thanks 🙏✌️

ARLINGTON , Va. – Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin has been named the NHL 's “ Third Star ” for the week ending Nov. 26 , the NHL announced today .
Ovechkin paced the NHL with five goals in four games ( 5-0—5 ) to guide the Capitals ( 14-10-1 , 29 points ) to a trio of wins . After being held off the scoresheet in a 4-1 loss to the Calgary Flames Nov. 20 , Ovechkin scored in each of their next three outings . That included one goal in both a 5-2 triumph over the Ottawa Senators Nov. 22 and 3-1 victory against the Tampa Bay Lightning Nov. 24 . Ovechkin capped the week with their 20th career hat trick – in front of one of their biggest fans , 13-year-old cancer survivor Alex Luey – in a 4-2 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs Nov. 25 . The 32-year-old Moscow , Russia , native ranks first in the NHL with 18 goals in 25 contests in 2017-18 ( 18-7—25 ) .
BAY CITY , MI -- A jury deliberated for nearly three hours before declaring a Bay City woman not guilty of excessively spanking their 6-year-old stepdaughter .
The five-man , seven-woman jury found Mara A. Hess-Schoonveld , 25 , not guilty of third-degree child abuse . The charge is a four-year felony . Hess-Schoonveld faced no other charges .
The jury delivered its verdict about 5:15 p.m. Wednesday , March 30 . Jurors started deliberating about 2:30 p.m .
On hearing the verdict , Hess-Schoonveld instantly began crying . After the individual jurors were polled by Bay County Circuit Judge Harry P. Gill , defense attorney David Helm and assorted family members hugged and congratulated Hess-Schoonveld .
In the hall outside the courtroom minutes later , one departing juror shouted , `` Congratulations '' to Hess-Schoonveld .
`` We think the jury made the right decision in this particular case , '' Helm said . `` It 's obvious that there 's an inter-family dispute and unfortunately my client , Mara , has been subject to that dispute , which resulted in these allegations . We just think the jury did the right thing . ''
Hess-Schoonveld declined to comment , apart from saying they were just going to go home .
The trial began Tuesday . In it , Bay County Assistant Prosecutor Bernard Coppolino argued Hess-Schoonveld repeatedly spanked their stepdaughter on April 1 , 2015 , causing bruising to their buttocks , thighs , and lower back . The injuries were discovered when the girl 's mother , Gina Schoonveld , gave them a bath on April 3 , they testified . The girl testified Tuesday that Hess-Schoonveld `` spanked me 20 times . ''
The incident happened during a family dinner at Hess-Schoonveld 's father 's house . Others in attendance testified the girl was refusing to eat their dinner and Hess-Schoonveld repeatedly took them to other rooms , but that they did not think the child was in any danger or injured .
Helm argued their client spanked the girl for refusing to eat their dinner , but only as a last resort after talking to her , sending them to timeout and trying other forms of discipline .
Activists in the mountain town , where 30,000 people have been trapped since July , speak of families eating leaves to survive
Madaya : residents of besieged Syrian town say they are being starved to death
Residents of a Syrian town a few dozen miles from the capital , Damascus , say they are dying of starvation as a result of a months-long siege by forces loyal to the government of Bashar al-Assad .
Families are eating leaves , grasses and water flavoured with spices in the town of Madaya , where rice is sold by the gram because a kilogram costs as much as $ 250 ( £170 ) . Some have killed and eaten their pets .
“ People are dying in slow motion , ” said Louay , a social worker from the town told the Guardian in a phone interview , their voice weakened by months of abject hunger . “ We had some flowers growing in pots at home . Yesterday , we picked the petals and ate them , but they were bitter , awful . ”
They sent pictures of emaciated bodies of several elderly men , recent casualties of the starvation . They had not taken the pictures himself , but said the men were well known in the town .
“ We used to say nobody could ever die from hunger , but we have seen people actually die of hunger . ”
A boy being pushed in a buggy in Madaya . Activists say many people in town are too weak to walk .
Other activists inside the town also shared pictures of starving children , one being pushed in a buggy far too small for them because they are too weak to walk .
Others who can still move around , and should normally be in school , are risking their lives trying to collect plants in minefields around the town 's outskirts , and several have lost limbs , residents said .
It was not possible to verify their claims because of the siege , but several independent accounts were consistent in describing life in a town desperately short of food , medicine and electricity .
“ Whether you are a man , woman , child , whether you 're 70 or 20 years old , you will have lost about 15kg of your weight , ” said Ebrahem Abbass , a defector who had served as a sergeant in the Syrian army . “ You do n't see a child whose eyes are n't sunken and staring from hunger . ”
Up to 30,000 people have been trapped in Madaya since July , under a tight siege by pro-government forces . They say they are being treated as pawns in a complicated power play , punished for the suffering of two villages hundreds of miles away at the hand of anti-government troops .
In the spring of last year , a rebel coalition known as Jaysh al-Fateh captured large swaths of north-western Syria from the Assad regime , surrounding two Shia enclaves in Idlib province called Fua and Kefraya , whose citizens are also enduring a debilitating siege .
Assad 's forces are now starving Madaya and neighbouring Zabadani , once a stronghold of the opposition , after a punishing six-month campaign .
Under a ceasefire deal , foreign backers of the government and the opposition are attempting to orchestrate a population swap , essentially a peaceful “ sectarian cleansing ” .
So far they have only managed to agree on an evacuation of wounded individuals on both sides and safe passage for a single aid delivery in October .
That allowed convoys to reach Madaya , Zabadani , Fua and Kefraya simultaneously , but supplies only lasted a few days , residents said .
“ I swear by God , and you might not believe me because it sounds fantastical , I tried to buy some food today , but a kilo of rice is 100,000 [ Syrian ] pounds , ” said Louay . “ A kilo of rice , bulgur , lentil , sugar – 100,000 , 100,000 , 100,000 . That is if you can find it . ”
At the black market exchange rate that would be close to £170 for rice .
“ I 've personally seen people slaughtering cats to eat them , and even the trees have been stripped of leaves now , ” they added .
People are so weak that they often faint , and hunger is made worse by the biting cold in an area about 1,300 metres above sea level , near the border with Lebanon .
Though a wooded hill is nearby , snipers have a clear shot , and residents said more than a dozen people had been killed trying to retrieve firewood . They also said children had lost limbs trying to gather grass to eat from nearby fields .
“ They blocked all the roads to both towns , and there are a lot of mines , ” said one teacher in Madaya , who did not want to give their name because of relatives in areas under government control . “ There is no way to explain , the students are always complaining they are hungry , but they have to study . ”
An aid official who visited Madaya and Zabadani in October as part of the convoy said they saw “ deep suffering ” .
“ There was a very dramatic appeal from the children in those two places , and the same dramatic appeal from Fua and Kefraya , ” they said . “ The children should not be suffering . ”
The official said they hoped for more agreements to deliver aid . But for now , the people in all the besieged towns suffer in a tragedy that is not of their making .
“ Here , we no longer call on anyone , ” said Louay . “ We have called for help so many times and nobody has heard us . But we want to ask the officials and decision-makers out there , if you were in this position , and your children were dying from hunger in front of you , what would be your reaction to the world outside that let you down ? Do n't forget to ask your readers this question . ”
More than a dozen computers seized in questionable search
* Berkeley , CA * — At 10:30 am on Wednesday , August 27th , the UC Berkeley police , plainclothes FBI agents , and an Alameda County sheriff raided at gunpoint the Long Haul , a long-standing community library and info shop . Police spent at least an hour and a half searching the premises without allowing Long Haul members entry to their building . More than a dozen computers and other equipment were seized in the morning raid . Having made no attempt to contact Long Haul members , agents forced their way into the building by entering a neighboring non-profit office with guns drawn . Police refused to provide a search warrant until after the raid was over and property was seized .
“ This is an outrageous abuse of authority by the federal government , ” said TKTK , a member of the Long Haul . “ What cause could the police have to come into a community center like the Long Haul and seize information belonging to the people of Berkeley ? They must return our property immediately. ” The police went through every room , both public and locked – cutting or unscrewing the locks – and removed every computer from the building . Most of the computers taken were removed from an un-monitored public space where people come to use the computers just as they would at a public library . The remaining computers were taken from closed offices where they are needed for the day-to-day operation of the work done by members . Offices were rifled through , and a list of people who had borrowed books from the library was checked , as was the sales log . The warrant , which was produced after the raid , had little relevant information ( claiming the officers were searching for 1 – Property or things used as a means of committing a felony ; 2 – Property or things that are evidence that tends to show a felony has been committed , or tends to show that a particular person has committed a felony ) .
The Long Haul has been a community resource for 25 years , offering accessible meeting space to radical groups , access to alternative magazines and journals , a lending library and a historical archive of independent media . Long Haul also produces the well-known slingshot organizer pocket calendar . Multiple groups have met and continue to meet there as one of the few remaining inexpensive radical venues in the increasingly gentrified bay area . The same pattern of abuse was experienced recently when the convergence space for protesters against the Democratic National Convention in Denver was raided and supplies seized . Since the Long Haul raid occurred , lawyers have been working to seek the immediate return of the seized property , though the Long Haul continues to welcome legal support . The Long Haul is also in urgent need of computers to replace what was taken , while the fight continues to get the hard drives returned .
Long Haul members have vowed to protest this latest act of political repression . Check the Long Haul website ( www.thelonghaul.org < http : //www.thelonghaul.org/ > ) for more information as it becomes available .
Pictures and video of the Long Haul and of the officers involved are online at http : //www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/08/27/18530389.php < http : //www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/08/27/18530389.php >
I 've adjusted to life on the digital gaming scene . I might still cough up money for a physical game that I really want , like a Square Enix JRPG or something that dances along my tastes , but these are strictly restricted to console games . I have n't bought a physical PC game since World of Warcraft back when it first launched , and if Konami 's latest move is a hint of the future , I never will again .
Early adopters of the physical PC version of Metal Gear Solid V , those who either want to or have to rely on a game on the disc , are reporting that the game 's CD does n't hold a whole lot . In fact , the only thing it does contain is the installer for the Steam version of the game , meaning that the physical product you actually buy in the store does n't have a game on it .
Contents on disc for the physical retail PC version of # MGSVTPP : - Steam installer ( 8.78 MB ) And… nothing else . pic.twitter.com/TcFskpSZ8O — graphμre | グラフ ( @ graphure ) August 30 , 2015
Yup , in spite of all the world 's seemingly infinite storage space that we have today , the disc in this box takes up a mere 8.78 MB . If you rely on physical media because your Internet speed is too slow or your bandwidth is too limited for digital distribution… sorry . Metal Gear Solid V : The Phantom Pain is not in your near future unless you 're part of the world or provider gets an overhaul . Hope you enjoy that $ 60 coaster you just bought with little to no warning of what was actually on it .
Is this better or worse than selling a disc with locked DLC on it ? And just to point out , Konami is n't the first to do this . I bought Final Fantasy XIV : A Realm Reborn for the PlayStation 3 which contains just an installer as well .
Metal Gear Solid V : The Phantom Pain launches tomorrow for the PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox 360 , Xbox One , and PC .

WINTERING WELL ....
Friday , February 22 , 2019 - Our winter weather continues to see-saw , and , with each upswing in temperature , the Peregrines are seen visiting the nest ledge on the Sheraton Hamilton Hotel . Ossie is once again courting their mate , Lily , bringing them meals . You can see them swooping in to collect one in the photo at left . Based on their behavior in previous years , as the weather becomes consistently warmer , we should see the pair inspect and prepare the scrape in the gravel for this year 's eggs , which we hope to see sometime in the last half of March .
BACKGROUND FOR 2019 ....
Hamilton 's resident adult pair , Lily and Ossie , are celebrating the fourth anniversary of their arrival in Hamilton , and will begin their fifth nesting season on the Sheraton Hamilton Hotel very soon .
Lily was banded in 2010 at the Grand Haven Board of Light & Power plant , in Michigan , and Ossie fledged from the Osler Hospital in Etobicoke in 2012 .
In 2018 , the pair hatched four chicks . Three of them fledged successfully , learning to fly and hunt , and left Hamilton at the end of the summer . The fourth chick did not fly as strongly , and came to ground on our busy city streets , where , sadly , it was struck by a car and killed . It seemed like this particular bird was weaker than the others , and quite possibly would have not survived long in the wild . But this occurrence highlights the extra dangers for Peregrines fledging in an urban environment , and the need for our Falcon Watch . We need lots of volunteers to help us with the on-street watch during the critical period when chicks are making their first flights . Perhaps you will join us this year ?
Many bird species exhibit a trait called 'site fidelity ' . If at least one of a pair that used a nest site in the previous year returns , and if there have been no significant physical changes to disturb either the nest itself or the birds generally , they will use the same nest site year after year . Peregrine Falcons are known for site fidelity . This will be the twenty-fifth year the same nest site on the Sheraton Hamilton Hotel has been used .

A few days ago I was discussing the economy with an office mate , and they said something interesting :
Did you know that we are the first generation that wo n't ever retire ?
After I finished laughing , I dug in and asked them why they believed this . As they explained their opinion ( which was sourced by NPR ) , what they said saddened me . How they said it also saddened me . They spoke as a victim to a system that was using them as a slave , a system that will use them for their entire life and throw them out when they are no longer of use . Sadly , he 's right ( sort of ) . And I just wanted to scream : It does n't have to be this way !
Here are a few facts about my friend :
They drive a truck that gets 20 miles per gallon . Worse , they commute 50 miles to work each way . They spend $ 1000/month on groceries , and another $ 200 eating out They own a $ 300K house , and their mortgage is about $ 1600/month . I do n't know for sure , but I suspect they make about $ 90K/year given their position at our company
At this point , I wanted to show them my story , but unfortunately it 's still important for me to keep my retirement plans under wraps at work , otherwise it would make things a little awkward .
Before we declare them a victim , let 's break down some of the numbers :
100 miles to work 5 days a week comes out to 500 miles per week . I do n't normally use the IRS value for cost of commute , but since they drive a 2010 truck that is both inefficient and depreciating at an astonishing rate , let 's say $ 0.50 per mile . This is equivalent to $ 250/week , and roughly $ 1000/month .
I asked them about their grocery budget , and they said it 's not possible to reduce because their wife loves to cook . Perplexed , I asked why their love for cooking could n't be steered in the direction of cheaper ingredients . They did n't really have an answer for this . I did n't suggest to them that they just eat rice and beans ( although a good bowl of rice and beans can be pretty satisfying ) , but perhaps they could lay off the red meats , , truffles , and foie gras . Let 's say a reasonable budget for a family of four that loves to cook is $ 500/month , and let 's reduce their restaurant budget to $ 100/month . This would be an additional $ 600/month saved .
Their $ 300K house is too much . Besides increasing their heating bills , it requires more time to clean and more stuff to fill it . Their family is the same size as mine , with 2 small kids , therefore I know they could easily fit within my $ 200K house quite comfortably . My mortgage is $ 870/month , including taxes and insurance . This means they could save an additional $ 730/month .
If they were to simply downsize their house by purchasing a new one close enough to our office to walk or bike to work , get rid of their truck ( or at least not drive it to work ) , and eat a simpler diet , they could be spending $ 2300/month less . ( BTW , this is before accounting for all the second order savings that come with less driving and a smaller house ) . Using a safe withdrawal rate of 3 % , this is equivalent to a savings of $ 920,000 ( multiply monthly expenses by 400 ) .
As I mentioned earlier , my friend makes about $ 90K/year . Just to keep things simple , let 's say it 's $ 60K after taxes , which works out to $ 5K/month . I know they have no savings beyond the 4 % they put into their 401K , which the company matches . So , basically , they require $ 5000/month to “ get by ” with their desired lifestyle . With all this added up , he 's correct in the assumption that he 'll never retire .
Now , if they made the changes I suggest they would instantly be saving $ 2300/month , nearly half of their entire income . At a 50 % savings rate , they could retire in 22 short years . At 38 years old this is n't ideal , but it 's a hell of a lot better than never retiring at all .
In the end , my friend is right . Many people in my generation will never be able to retire , or will be so old and tired that it wo n't be much fun . Their prime years will be past them , and their kids will already be too busy working towards their own non-retirement . He 's also right that they are a victim , but he 's pointing their blame in the wrong direction . He 's not a victim of the economy or “ the system , ” he 's a victim of their own beliefs on how life should be lived , and what choices they have in front of him .
Democrat Terry McAuliffe eked out a narrow victory in the Virginia governor 's race on Tuesday night , defeating Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli ( R ) and Libertarian candidate Rob Sarvis .
McAuliffe 's victory speech focused on bipartisanship . They thanked the Republicans who backed them in the race and said the victory was hard fought .
“ This election was never a choice between Democrats and Republicans , ” McAuliffe said . “ It was an election over whether Virginia would continue the mainstream bipartisan tradition that served us so well . ”
McAuliffe 's win ends months of them leading Cuccinelli in most polls . It also marks a victory for a number of outside groups that poured millions in the race in support of McAuliffe and against Cuccinelli like Independence USA PAC and Planned Parenthood .
Democrats see the victory as proof that hitting conservative candidates on their tea party leanings can win elections .
“ The Republican brand has become the tea party brand . They are inseparable now , ” Democratic National Committee Communications Director Mo Elleithee told TPM . “ Kind of take a step back from just Virginia . Joe Lhota up in New York , where they have n't elected a Democrat in 20 years , spent the entire general election trying to distance themselves from the Republican Party brand , even though they previously called themselves a Goldwater Conservative , tried to distance themselves from the Republican brand . That did n't work . Polling is showing that for the first time the tea party and the Republican Party are polling at the same abysmal level . ”
The idea , Elleithee continued , is to tie Republicans to the tea party as tightly as possible .
“ People do n't see a distinction between the two , ” Elleithee continued . “ And both brands are weaker than ever . This is becoming a referendum on the Republican Party . ”
Democrats stress that McAuliffe 's attack strategy is only part of the recipe of cooking a successful campaign and add that the right candidate with the right message has to be on the other side of the attacks . Linking a candidate to the tea party through topics like the government shutdown , abortion issues or gun rights can only happen if the candidate embraces those stances too , as Cuccinelli did .
“ I think you happen to have a really extreme ideologue running and if you look at who has been in leadership positions in Virginia , state executive positions , whether they have been Democrats or Republicans , they have governed from the middle , ” Virginia Democratic activist Susan Swecker said .
But Democrats say the same strategy that McAuliffe used — stick to the center in a blue-leaning-purple state while also turning Cuccinelli 's habit of touting their conservatism against them — can be used in future races in Virginia and even around the country .
“ I do think it is something , at least in Virginia that is replicable , because we 've proven ourselves to be a state that if you look at our last three governors and you look at the campaigns they ran they were real claims to the center . Every one of them was about jobs and mainstream economic issues that spoke about things that really mattered to Virginians ' lives , ” a Virginia Democratic party official told TPM .
Other elections on Tuesday night support this argument . Cuccinelli , a candidate who hoped support from tea partiers in Virginia would propel them to the governor 's mansion , lost while New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie ( R ) , who identifies with the more mainstream wing of the GOP , is expected to win handily .
“ The difference between the two candidates is self-evident — Christie has governed as an unapologetic centrist Republican with a no-nonsense focus on fighting for fiscal discipline rather than an obsession with social conservatism , ” Daily Beast executive senior editor John Avlon wrote in a column for CNN . “ He has built cross-aisle coalitions , even on controversial policy proposals , and reached out beyond the base . They put problem-solving ahead of partisanship or ideology . In other words , Christie is pretty much the opposite of Cuccinelli , and that 's why they are winning in an otherwise ugly year for Republicans . ”
The trick , Democrats say , is to focus on winning over voters that conservative candidates are quick to alienate , like women voters , LGBT people and minorities . McAuliffe simultaneously focused on the economy while also staying on the attack . Virginia Democrats say McAuliffe did a masterful job at this and likely would have won those groups without the help of outside organizations like former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords 's ( D-AZ ) Americans for Responsible Solutions and Planned Parenthood ( although their support helped as did Cuccinelli 's outspoken opposition to abortion rights and gun rights among other issues ) .
McAuliffe also benefited from the shutdown as the blame fell on mostly congressional Republicans which they were able to link to Cuccinelli via some of the surrogates who went out to campaign for the attorney general like Sens . Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) and Rand Paul ( R-KY ) . Democrats hope that the shutdown would also stay in the minds of voters around the country through the next election cycle .
“ With so many government employees and so many military installations that Virginians were particularly impacted by the shutdown , it 's not surprising that Cuccinelli suffered , ” said Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . “ Nowhere in America did any state 's voters think that shutting the federal government down in order to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act was a good idea . ”
“ Ken Cuccinelli themselves connected themselves to the tea party , ” Wasserman Schultz said . “ He had Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and the entire Mount Rushmore of the tea party come in to campaign for them here . ”
Cuccinelli did try to move to the center at moments throughout the campaign but even when they did it was clearly insincere which helped the McAuliffe campaign , McAuliffe spokesperson Josh Schwerin said .
“ He sort of would pretend to talk about jobs and keep end up talking about how abortion is like slavery and that 's the kind of issue that kept coming up for them and they never attempted to talk to independent voters , they never attempted to talk to mainstream Republicans even and that was something that Terry thinks is an important thing you should be doing both campaigning and governing , ” Schwerin said .
Even before polls closed Tuesday night the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had already sent out a campaign email to supporters capitalizing on an expected McAuliffe win . The email cited contentious Senate races around the country as examples where the same strategy of hitting Cuccinelli could work .
“ Faced with a choice between a reckless and irresponsible candidate who backs the Tea Party agenda and Democrats willing to push for responsible solutions to the problems our nation faces , Democrats win , ” the email said . “ And unfortunately for national Republicans , their Senate candidates in North Carolina , Arkansas , Louisiana , Alaska , Georgia , Kentucky , Iowa , Michigan , Montana , and West Virginia have made it clear they 're on the side of Ted Cruz and Ken Cuccinelli . On the government shutdown , women 's issues , and jobs and the economy , voters in Virginia tonight will reject their platform . ”
Virginia Democrats caution though that the tea party strategy can only be so effective if the candidate actually embraces the tea party as much as Cuccinelli did in Virginia . But that should n't be much of a problem , according to Elleithee .
“ Terry McAuliffe was just the better candidate with the better message and they understood the state better . And that matters , ” Elleithee said .
The caves discovered are the Rukhabulu Awabu , Ifeli-feli and Ceruk Reugable caves . ''
Jayapura ( ANTARA News ) - The Archaeology Office of Jayapura has in its research found prehistoric caves used to be inhabited by prehistoric people in the Karst hilly areas of Lake Sentani , Jayapura , Papua , a researcher said . `` The caves discovered are the Rukhabulu Awabu , Ifeli-feli and Ceruk Reugable caves , '' researcher Hari Suroto of the Jayapura Archaeology Office , said here on Sunday.He said that their physical conditions and surroundings near a water source , where artifacts such as pottery , lake mollusc shells , marine mollusc shells and animal bones , indicated that the caves were used as human dwellings during the Neolithic age . `` The findings of the marine mollusc shells in the Reugable site and Cave Rukhabulu Awabhu , illustrate that in the past the inhabitants of the two sites have been consuming marine mollusks , '' they said.This is very interesting because there is proof that the inhabitants of the caves had communications with the community members living in the coastal areas of the youtefa Bay . `` This indicates that the prehistoric men have already had communications with each other as proven by the findings of the sea mollusc shells in the caves , '' they said.After all , the type of soil in the three caves are not suitable for producing potteries . Thus , it is concluded that the potteries found in the caves came from other places outside the cave areas . `` The black color found outside the potteries indicated that they were also used to cook , '' they said.Lake Sentani is located in an area between the Jayapura city and the District of Jayapura with a width of 9,300 hectares . It is part of the Cyclops Nature Preserve . ( Uu.A014 )
Russians Do n't Understand Why Anyone Is Upset With ‘ Girl Crazy ' Weinstein
MOSCOW — As the number of women alleging sexual assault by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein continues to mount , there is one country where the public does n't seem to believe the claims : Russia .
Never one for subtleties , especially if the United States is involved , Russia has reacted to the scandal erupting across America and Europe with a mixture of incredulity and bemusement .
Raising their hand to their mouth in a show of embarrassment , the Russian contestant for next month 's “ Miss Universe ” pageant , Ksenia Alexandrova , told reporters that Russia would never experience anything like it , thanks to President Vladimir Putin . The beauty queen did n't elaborate on how the Russian leader would manage this . Russia 's “ Miss World ” candidate Polina Popova agreed , chiming in last week : “ Everything depends on how a woman behaves around a man . You need to keep your distance , and everything will turn out fine . ”
In Putin 's Russia , women 's issues have been sacrificed amid a rising wave of conservatism , coinciding with the spread of the powerful Russian Orthodox Church . Putin decriminalized certain aspects of domestic violence in February , and an anti-abortion debate is gaining traction . Just over a decade ago , Putin themselves was caught making light of sexual assault with then-Israeli President Moshe Katsav , who was accused — and later convicted — of raping an employee . ( The Kremlin later said Putin was making a joke that was lost in translation ) .
When it comes to Russia 's deeply patriarchal society , both sides of the political spectrum have gone after the victims in the Weinstein scandal , where dozens of female celebrities are accusing the media mogul of a litany of sexual misconduct , from unwanted advances to rape . They include A-list names such as Angelina Jolie and Rose McGowan , who are well known to Russian audiences .
“ Why did you stay quiet all of these years ? ” TV Rain 's Mikhail Kozyrev asked of the women who claim Weinstein sexually harassed and abused them . “ What prevented you at that moment from taking a step back to say , ‘ I will never work with this person , ' or ‘ Danger ! ' ” said Kozyrev , whose channel is the country 's only form of independent television . ( TV Rain is also the channel that recently broadcast an interview with a member of the infamous “ Russian Troll Farm , ” which allegedly was involved in trying to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election . Among other revelations , Russian trolls working there were required to watch “ House of Cards . ” )
Life , a pro-Kremlin tabloid site and television channel that has been covering the story with much enthusiasm , described Weinstein — whose name is transliterated into Russian as ‘ Vainshtein ' , a common Russian Jewish surname — in deferential and vindicatory terms , calling them a “ sex machine ” who is just “ girl crazy . ”
On major state broadcaster Channel 1 , host Ivan Urgant opened their late-night talk show last week with the Weinstein revelations . “ So it seems that in American show business , you can sleep your way in , ” Urgant joked to their on-set audience . “ It 's not like that here , ” they said , before adding in jest that a male security guard in their TV tower once offered them entry to the building in return for sexual favors .
While the Weinstein scandal is raising questions about rape culture across the globe , and forcing other sections of the media , including journalism , to examine its own behavior , Russia has avoided such self-exploration . Issues of sexual harassment and domestic violence are largely taboo in Russia , though both are widespread , campaigners say .
But Russia 's nascent feminist movement has condemned the victim-blaming in the Weinstein affair . Addressing the “ Miss Universe ” contestant who thanked Putin for keeping Russia free from such scandal , women 's rights campaigner Alena Popova said talking about sexual harassment was a sign of a healthy society . “ Perhaps you 're thanking the authorities because we have women who stay silent about harassment , because they 're told they 're at fault , ” they wrote sarcastically on their Facebook page .
Popova — who is not related to the “ Miss World ” contestant of the same name — also pointed out that by law , Russia currently has few effective legal protections for women who are harassed at work .
There could also be a political element to Russia 's resistance to looking itself in the mirror , said film producer Victoria Smirnoff , the only Russian woman who has publicly accused Weinstein of making unwanted advances on them Smirnoff , now 43 and living in Switzerland , said Weinstein pushed them into the bathroom of their hotel suite in the early 2000s in Beverly Hills , where they fidgeted with the zipper of their pants . The incident did n't go further as their boyfriend saw something was amiss and knocked on the door .
They laugh it off now , saying they do n't consider themselves a victim .
In an email exchange with Foreign Policy , they said that since writing about their experience on Friday , they have been inundated with Russian media requests but has refused to be interviewed by them , fearful they are seeking to sensationalize their case and distract attention from the country 's own woes .
“ They wo n't miss a chance to point fingers at America , ” they wrote .
Just When You Thought the Stupid Could n't Get Any Stupider
MLB already has game caps , BP caps , Elmer Fudd caps , St. Paddy 's Day caps , All-Star Game caps , World Series caps , throwback caps , futuristic caps , G.I . Joe caps , flag-desecration caps , wild card winner caps , division champion caps , league champion caps , World Series champion caps , snap-back caps , low-profile caps , distressed caps , and probably a few other caps I ca n't think of right now .
Any reasonable person surveying this headwear landscape can only come to one possible conclusion : We need more motherfucking caps .
Fortunately , the folks at MLB have taken heroic steps to alleviate this tragic cap shortage before it reaches Irish Potato Famine-like proportions . Behold what they have magnanimously bestowed upon a cap-benighted world : the interview cap .
Every team will supposedly have one , but for now only the Mets ' version has leaked . No word yet on whether the Braves ' version will feature an Indian being interviewed . ( Also no word on whether Cleveland will produce a special Albert Belle commemorative edition that says , “ Fuck you , go away . ” )
The Mets ' interview cap design was first leaked yesterday afternoon by a blog that now wishes to remain anonymous . According to that blogger , “ From what I hear its purpose is to be worn during interviews and off-the-field stuff ( charity events , blood drives , etc. ) . Unlike the NHL 's version , however , it will not be mandatory for players/coaches to wear the cap during interviews . It 's more if just a ‘ Here if you want it ' type of thing . ”
Yes , well , who would n't want it ?
Of course , as longtime readers may be aware , I have nobody to blame for all this but myself .
( Oh , nearly forgot : That is one ass-ugly cap . )

Fire is near the top of a short list of the mandatory survival list . Fire keeps you warm , provides signal for emergency rescue , helps you purify water , cooks food , and increases morale .
Food , water , and shelter are relatively easy to acquire compared to fire . The hard truth is that without fire , safely consumable water and food are virtually impossible and shelter has limited value . All of this leads us to one conclusion : fire is mandatory for survival .
My wife and I recently went on a Labor Day Weekend backpacking trip in a wilderness area in Northern New Mexico . The high altitude scenery was breathtakingly beautiful and the terrain was intimidating . 11,000 foot peaks surrounded a high alpine lake with several waterfalls and streams flowing in . Big horn sheep dotted the areas above the treeline while virgin evergreen forest blanketed the steep mountain sides . We had a grand opportunity to have no other campers around so we shared the lake with a half dozen chipmunks while the wild sheep looked down upon us .
My goal for this camping trip was twofold . First , it was time to get unplugged and back to nature for a few days . Second , I wanted to test some of my new outdoor survival skills and tools . This is where things got interesting :
I proceeded to gather kindling and wood to make a small fire . I took out my brand-new magnesium bar and tried to imitate what I 've seen a dozen times on survival TV episodes . I spent the next two hours busting knuckles , cursing , and freezing in a failed attempt to start fire . I failed ! We spent the next two days cold camping in the gorgeous wilderness . Thank goodness I had a stove .
Lessons I learned from the failed fire making attempt :
1 . Dry kindling is mandatory . Even a blow torch will not burn wet wood .
2 . Starting a fire in the wild requires tremendous amounts of patience , practice , and experience .
3 . Brute force and determination are not enough . Avoid burning precious energy wherever possible .
My solution to life saving fire was to make my own fire starters . I wanted the kind of fire starter that would take a match and stay lit long enough to ignite kindling . Store bought fire starter is expensive and not weatherproof . Why weatherproof you ask ? Have you ever tent camped or backpacked in the rain ?
My solution to cheap , weatherproof fires starters : left over candle wax and dryer lint . If your home is anything like mine then there is a lady that lives there too . That lady loves scented candles . My wife has so many scented candles that my living room looks like a church on Easter Sunday with all of those things lit . I have been wondering what to do with dryer lint for years . Those useless little balls of cotton , pet hair , and who knows what else light and burn up faster than gasoline on a campfire .
Why the wax ? The wax serves two purposes . Petroleum based wax burns slowly . The candle wax soaked dryer lint is easy to light but burns slowly . It is that slow and steady flame that you need to ignite damp kindling . The wax also weatherproofs the dryer lint . Lint along will soak up any moisture which renders it useless . Coated in wax , the lint repels water and stays ready to use .
Access candle wax by first allowing your sweetheart to burn all the candles their little heart desires and pretend you like the cupcake , vanilla , cherry blossom , pine scent . Remove the bottoms of the used up candles and save the residual wax in a plastic bag . Access dryer lint by pretending you are a good husband and do the dang laundry for once ! Pull the excess lint out of the dryer vent filter after each cycle . Store it in a ziploc bag .
Carefully melt the wax in a small pot on the stove on low heat . It takes only a minute or two . DO NOT leave it unattended .
Drop the golf ball size balls of lint into the HOT melted wax . Flip over and press lightly with a teaspoon to coat the lint and get the wax to soak in .
Remove the waxed lint balls and allow to cool and dry until somewhat hard to the touch .
Test out in your fireplace or on a camping trip . It takes only a small match to get lit .
Store in a plastic bag until SHTF .

IT 'S feared that robots will one day declare war on humans and slaughter every single one of us .
Today this nightmare scenario came one step closer with the development of a `` predator robot '' that 's designed to hunt down prey with deadly efficiency .
Caters News Agency 2 Could robots one day hunt animals or even HUMANS ?

Swiss researchers have designed a machine that 's capable of identifying and chasing victims just like a tiger or lion .
Currently , the predator 'bot has only been tasked with hunting another robot , but it 's not hard to see similar technology being used in death droids designed to target human beings .
READ MORE : Terrorists ‘ actively seeking ' to build deadly army of intelligent killer robots , UN warns
In a highly technical paper , experts from the University of Zulrich described using an artificial brain called a neutral network to help their robot recognise its target .
It uses laser beams to detect another robot , going into prowl mode if it does n't see its victim . This means the predator is capable of walking around , searching for its prey .
Although the predator robot can only travel at about six miles per hour , researchers said this speed would increase to about 37 miles per hour if it was built to be the size of a car .
The research does have some benefits to humanity , because the technology could be used to make sure driverless cars do n't hit other automobiles or pedestrians .
Tobi Delbruck , professor at the Institute of Neuroinformatics , said that `` one could imagine future luggage or shopping carts that follow you '' using the system .

Anyone working to design these machines would find today 's research extremely interesting .
Robots might not be able to hunt down and assassinate humans just yet , but you can bet your life that a real killer robot will be unleashed on humanity sooner or later .
Treasurer Mike Nahan did n't pull any punches about the project , saying Fremantle council `` simply did n't understand the needs of the port '' . Mike Nahan pitched the controversial sale , which up until this year even Mr Barnett opposed , as necessary to cut debt and provide funding for essential infrastructure . Credit : Louise Kennerley The WA government is currently looking at selling off the port which could pour as much as $ 2 billion into the state 's kitty . `` This is a significantly flawed proposal , '' Dr Nahan said . `` The very core of Fremantle is its identity as a port city , yet this proposal would strangle the port 's economic viability .
`` The due diligence process for the proposed divestment of Fremantle Port is currently underway . Fremantle Mayor Brad Pettitt . Credit : Facebook `` This work includes financial analysis and consideration of a wide range of marine and landside issues . Assessing container trade capacity , operational needs , land requirements and uses ( including Victoria Quay ) and potential for future development is part of this process . '' Fremantle mayor Brad Pettitt said on Monday the proposal was a once-in-a-generation project and it would be bigger than Elizabeth Quay and the Perth City Link combined . `` Imagine a publicly accessible historic port waterfront from the WA Maritime Museum down to the Fremantle traffic bridge , '' they said .
`` Imagine the Fremantle Passenger Terminal not surrounded by a sea of parked cars but instead being part of an attractive precinct to greet cruise ship tourists . Imagine restaurants , bars and cafes overlooking the working cranes across the water on North Quay . '' Fremantle 's proposal would waste hundreds of millions of dollars . But Dr Nahan was scathing of the city 's idea of slicing up the port for development , saying Fremantle 's proposal would waste hundreds of millions of dollars in existing infrastructure . `` Even if the Victoria Quay/South Quay was not constrained by buffer zones and remediation costs , its value does not come close to approaching the value of the replacement infrastructure , '' they said . `` Existing buffer areas , such as those relating to dangerous good operations , surrounding the inner harbour have a critical influence on the nature and scale of development that is permissible on Victoria Quay and surrounds . ''
Dr Nahan said the project did not consider the future needs of the state . `` These issues directly impact the value that may be derived by the state from any land reserved from the transaction , '' they said `` Further , the proposal apparently ignores the extended timeframe required to develop replacement infrastructure ( assuming it could be funded ) to free up the inner harbour land , and then the development timeframe for the remediation and sale of land . '' Dr Pettitt hit back at the treasurer , saying the land around South Quay - used for parking new cars - was `` low-hanging fruit , ripe for the picking '' . `` Moving the storage of new cars from the south part of the port is moving the cheapest , least infrastructure intensive port use , which also happens to be on the best land , closest to the centre of Fremantle , '' they said .
`` The City of Fremantle has commissioned an independent economic analysis to examine the costs and benefits of this approach , which we will feed into the formal port sale process . `` Restricting the operational port area to the north side would shift the buffer zone away from the centre of Fremantle and enable a far broader range of uses on South and Victoria Quay than is currently allowed potentially including residential and hotel uses . `` This will also increase the value of the land on Victoria and South Quay .

The U.S. Navy variant of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft , the F-35C , conducts a test flight over the Chesapeake Bay near Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland on Feb. 11 , 2011 .
The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , a next-generation warplane capable of taking off on a short runway and landing vertically , could make its first trans-Atlantic flight in July , if the U.S. Department of Defense agrees to showcase the advanced fighter jet at two international air shows this summer .
U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is `` very close '' to approving the outing , which would mark the F-35 's international air-show debut , Reuters reported , quoting multiple sources familiar with the issue who were not authorized to speak publicly about the decision .
According to the Reuters report , if the Defense Department approves , two or three F-35s would fly from the United States to the U.K . They 'd then fly at the Royal International Air Tattoo , the world 's largest military air show , held each July in Gloucestershire in the U.K. , and the Farnborough International Airshow , a weeklong event held every other year in Hampshire , England . [ In Photos : F-35 Fighter Jet Makes 1st Vertical Night Landing ]
The summer events could generate new interest in the F-35 program , which has come under heavy criticism for its hugely inflated budget and for falling years behind schedule , according to news reports .
`` Having the aircraft front and center on the U.K. stage will focus attention on the fact that it 's a fairly mature program at this point , with over 100 jets built , '' an unnamed source told Reuters .
The airshows could also help the F-35 's lead contractor , Lockheed Martin Corp. , demonstrate the capabilities of the stealth fighter jet and build support among interested nations .
Britain 's Ministry of Defence is slated to buy 138 F-35s in the coming years , and South Korea has plans to purchase 40 of the warplanes . Yet , Canada and Denmark — two countries that helped fund the F-35 's development — have been rethinking whether to add these radar-evading planes to their air fleets , according to Reuters .
The F-35 's short takeoff and vertical landing capabilities enable the warplane to operate from a range of diverse locations , including amphibious ships , aircraft carriers and airfields , military officials have said .
In August 2013 , the stealth fighter successfully completed its first-ever vertical night landing at sea , aboard the USS Wasp , a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship . Since the program launched , pilots have conducted approximately 700 short takeoffs and completed more than 380 vertical landings .
The F-35s are expected to form the core of the U.S. military 's aviation fleet , eventually providing the bulk of tactical power for the Air Force , Marine Corps and Navy .

“ My Girlfriend 's ” Miata : Part 7 – LRB Speed Aero Cooling Panels
An update for My Girlfriend 's Miata Project has us dipping our toes into the world of aerodynamic performance . I feel as this is an often overlooked aspect of street car performance and another area we shall address as we try to improve all aspects of our Miata platform . We 'll hold off on improving downforce/reducing drag for a future article and instead start with improving reliability through better control of the air for the cooling system .
Here 's our OEM undertray in all its glory . Oily , broken and with a hint of overspray for that classy touch . If it were n't broken , the OEM design is n't terrible . Mazda sealed the sides and mounted the tray to the bumper 's inlet , but there is one glaring mistake . What 's the deal with the large air gap beneath the radiator ? Is it missing parts ? Drag reduction ? Turbofan bypass ? All I know is that the gap 's got ta go ! Here 's our OEM undertray in all its glory . Oily , broken and with a hint of overspray for that classy touch . If it were n't broken , the OEM design is n't terrible . Mazda sealed the sides and mounted the tray to the bumper 's inlet , but there is one glaring mistake . What 's the deal with the large air gap beneath the radiator ? Is it missing parts ? Drag reduction ? Turbofan bypass ? All I know is that the gap 's got ta go !
The more I work on it , the more I notice that Mazda put a hell of a lot of time and care into this platform . From the factory , the radiator has a well designed shroud to channel air into it , but there is definitely room for improvement . The biggest area for upgrade on our particular Miata was that the factory plastic shroud was damaged and falling off . It ca n't really work right if it is n't really attached . That being said , even if it were in perfect condition the OEM shroud left a sizable gap that would let our well-channelled air bypass the radiator , reducing cooling efficiency . Why they did this I am uncertain , but this was unacceptable after installing our beautiful Koyo radiator and had to be addressed .
When I saw the issue with the factory shroud , I knew immediately what I would do if I were to improve upon the design . I 'd keep everything as is , but add a seal between the panel and the bottom of the radiator to force all the air through the radiator instead of allowing a large amount to bypass it . I began an internet search looking for the best undertray designs the aftermarket had to offer and when I laid my eyes upon LRB Speed 's design , I knew I had to have it .
LRB Speed is a husband and wife team based in Florida who just happen to have an unhealthy obsession with all things rotary . Established in 2014 , their goal was to improve upon commonly failing parts of older , FB Mazda RX-7s by replacing said parts with more durable materials . When these upgrades started to hit the market , Mazda enthusiasts of all stripes wanted to have LRB design and manufacture parts for their models . Naturally , LRB began making parts for FC and FD RX-7s , as well as Miatas , RX-8s and they have even branched out into other vehicle makes .
LRB Speed 's undertray comes in 4 pieces , well packaged and ready to screw together simply . The largest piece is the main aluminum undertray . It comes with provisions to mount to the bumper and subframe , reinforcing the entire assembly . LRB Speed 's undertray comes in 4 pieces , well packaged and ready to screw together simply .

The sides bolt onto the car first , with slots for the undertray to slide and lock in place . Everything is precisely bent for sway bar clearance and mounting to existing boltholes . The final piece of the puzzle is what I liked the most . It is a simple piece of bent aluminum that mounts to the main undertray and seals the large gap beneath the radiator on the OEM design .

Additionally , we are going with LRB 's air diversion cooling panel that mounts under the hood to keep air from spilling over the top of the radiator . Options for cars with the factory hood latch are available as well as the limited edition models that had the windshield washer reservoir in this area .

LRB includes a full set of instructions and parts breakdown with each kit . It 's with this simple paperwork that we can see how the system works so well , sealing off the sides and bottom of the radiator to get maximum airflow through the radiator , instead of around it .

All the hardware for the installation is included and is either stainless steel or plated for a long life . I almost feel bad putting this nice hardware on the messy and rusty undercarriage of a Midwestern and neglected Miata . We 'll have to address that in the future .

Heating water is one of the most energy-intensive ( and thus polluting ) things that takes place in the average house or apartment building . There are two main approaches to make it greener : We can use less hot water in the first place ( shorter showers , making sure the dishwasher is full , wash clothes in cold water , etc ) , and we can improve the water heaters themselves so they 're more efficient.The second option is exactly what the U.S. Department of Energy is trying to do . It has just announced stricter energy efficiency standards for water heaters that can hold 55 gallons or more .
The new regulation will require electric water heaters to use 47 % less energy starting in 2015 , and gas water heaters will need to be at least 30 % more efficient .
`` Over three decades , DOE says the new rules will save a total of $ 10 billion and prevent up to 164 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions -- the equivalent of taking 46 million cars off the road for one year . ''
Looking Forward : Heating Water Without Heating the Planet
I 'm happy that these new rules are stricter than those that were proposed late last year , but I wish the DOE had looked a bit farther out in the future . It would 've been great to have progressively more stringent targets for 2015 , targets for 2020 , 2025 , etc . I also wish the same rules applied to units under 55 gallons ( they 'll need to reduce energy-consumption too , but not as much ) , which is what a lot of houses have .
The greenest course of action is probably to progressively use more and more solar water heaters and on-demand ( aka tankless ) water heaters ( even better if you can combine the two , though you 'd require a tank to hold the pre-heated water so you ' lose some of the benefits of the on-demand unit ) .

Arab women have announced the foundation of of “ Martyr Amara Arab Women 's Battalion ” under the umbrella of the Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) . The battalion has been formed as more Arab women started to join the SDF . The battalion is a first in Arab history . In the announcement of the battalion , the women stated that this is a first step and the battalions will expand to other regions .
During the preparations of the foundation , SDF Commander Rojda Şiyar had said : “ With this battalion , we will have shown all women of the Middle East that Arab women can also have a role in the military arena and can defend their lands . With Rojava , the Kurdish women created a great change and this change is taken as an example throughout all regions of Syria . ”
The new cold warriors , as analyst James Carden calls them , are worried : the Syrian ceasefire , brokered by Moscow and Washington , could lead not only to a stable peace process in the war-torn country , but also to a thaw between Russia and the United States .
This is not what US hardliners , like NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Philip Breedlove , look forward to . If intra-Syrian peace talks succeed , `` the prospects for the new cold war that they are so desperate to wage will be dealt a serious setback , '' Carden explained in an opinion piece for the Nation .
The analyst , who served as the advisor to the US-Russia Presidential Commission at the US State Department , maintains that US hawks would opt for a time–tested method to prevent Moscow and Washington from getting closer together . They will resume their campaign of painting Russia as a dangerous enemy .

This is exactly what happened . Several days before the Syrian ceasefire came into effect General Breedlove told the House Armed Services Committee that `` Russia has chosen to be an adversary and poses a long-term existential threat to the United States . `` Breedlove , like other high-ranking NATO officials , has previously made similar comments .
US hardliners want to achieve two goals : they seek to `` derail the next round of Syria peace talks while further undermining US-Russian relations , '' Carden noted . They are also ready to recruit anyone , who shares their goals .
`` The tendency of the new cold warriors to praise anyone thought to be standing up to Russia , no matter how noxious , can be seen in their fulsome expressions of solidarity with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , '' the analyst detailed . `` Indeed , Turkey 's by now well-known collusion with [ Daesh ] is studiously ignored in favor [ of ] a narrative that paints Turkey as the latest target of Putin 's Russia . ''

Moscow 's relations with Ankara went south after a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian bomber over Syrian territory . Turkish authorities cited airspace violations as the reason behind the move , but failed to provide proof that they took place . For their part , Russian defense officials and the Su-24 pilot released data showing that the plane never crossed into Turkey .
A new method of data storage that converts information into DNA sequences allows you to store the contents of an entire computer hard-drive on a gram 's worth of E. coli bacteria ... and perhaps considerably more than that .
The idea of storing data inside bacteria has been around for about a decade . Even very simple bacteria have long strands of DNA with tons of bases available for data encryption , and bacteria are by their nature far more resilient to damage than more traditional electronic storage . Bacteria are nature 's hardiest survivors , capable of surviving just about any disaster that would finish off a regular hard drive . Besides , bacteria 's natural reproduction would create lots of redundant copies of the data , which would help preserve the integrity of the information and make retrieval easier .

Preparing traditional data for storage inside bacteria is simple enough . There are four DNA bases that can be used to make up the DNA strings : adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine . That basically means we 're working with a four number system , also known as quaternary numbers .
In a presentation on their breakthrough , the Hong Kong researchers showed how to change the word `` iGEM '' into DNA-ready code . They used the ASCII table to convert each of the individual letters into a numerical value ( i=105 , G=71 , etc . ) , which can then be changed from base-10 to base-4 ( 105=1221 , 71=0113 , etc. ) . Finally , those numbers can be changed into their DNA base equivalents , with 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 replaced with A , T , C , and G. And so iGEM becomes ATCTATTGATTTATGT .

Once the raw data is ready , the researchers say a few algorithms can be used to weed out redundant and repetitive information . That does n't just save a ton of space - lots of repetition in the DNA sequence can actually be biologically harmful to the wellbeing of the DNA and bacteria , so this step rather neatly solves two problems at once .
DNA strands are n't long enough to store complicated information like a photograph or a book , so the best available solution is to fragment the data into lots of little pieces and spread it among the different cells . To make that work , the researchers have to create a system that allows the fragments to identify and ultimately put back in the right order . So they created a three-part structure for all the DNA : header , message , and checksum .
The header is an 8-base-long sequence that is divided into four levels of identifying information - zone , region , area and district - which allows each fragment to be put back in the right order . After the message carries the actual usable data , the checksum provides a repetition of the original header , which is useful in controlling for minor mutations to the bacteria .

So , let 's say the information has been encrypted and placed in lots of different cells of bacteria . How then does someone retrieve the data on the other end ? The decrypter would take the DNA and run it through what 's known as next-generation high-throughput sequencing , or NGS . This particular type of sequencing analyzes and compares multiple copies of the same sequence and then uses majority-voting to figure out which bases are correct if parts of the data have decayed . Then the compression algorithms could be reversed to restore the raw data to its original form .
The last step would be snapping the fragments back together in the correct order so that the DNA strands could be translated back into useful data . This is where we go from just data storage to data encryption . The person trying to read the data needs a formula that will reveal the right order of the headers and checksums - without that formula , the data remains meaningless .
That 's the theory - how about the application ? Well , let 's hear straight from the researchers themselves :
This rci-system is feasible in DH5-alpha strain of E. coli , as supported by extracted plasmid DNA size . It is found that the size of the DNA extracted is consistent with that of DNA stored in the plasmid before extraction . There is no loss of DNA , implying that no large deletion has occurred during the experimental procedure . In the first trial , we encoded a short message in a single vector , together with two inverted repeats . We designed primers which targets the encoded message either in normal orientation or reverse-complementary orientation . Both sets of primers could be used to generate PCR products , indicating that encoded message exists in both recombinated and normal forms . Sequencing results confirmed the correctness of the PCR product .

The possibilities of this biotechnology are truly amazing . A single gram of E. coli cells could hold up to 900,000 gigabytes ( or 900 terabytes ) of data , meaning these bacteria have almost 500 times the storage capacity of a top of the line commercial hard drive .
Indeed , my best hard drive is a 1.5 terabyte drive that weights just about exactly one kilogram . If I had that hard drive 's weight in storage bacteria , I 'd have 900 petabytes of storage space that could sit unobtrusively in the corner of my desk . Of course , we do n't know yet the precise practical applications - it 's quite possible this will remain strictly used for complex encryption work .

Now , there does seem like one potential concern with using E. coli to store data : is n't E. coli dangerous ? It appears there 's not too much to worry about there - the researchers used non-virulent strains of the bacteria , and the bacteria ca n't do much more than store the data and reproduce . The DNA sequences that represent the data are total gibberish when it comes to encoding potentially dangerous proteins .

2014 marks the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty , and many claim that President Johnson 's program has lifted millions out of poverty . But if we really want to help the poor , research suggests that economic freedom does more than government aid .
Economic Freedom Within the United States
In “ A Dynamic Analysis of Economic Freedom and Income Inequality in the 50 States : Empirical Evidence of a Parabolic Relationship , ” Daniel L. Bennett and Richard K. Vedder argue that , past a certain point , economic freedom decreases inequality . Increasing economic freedom benefits the poor and middle class more than it helps the wealthy .
Bennett and Vedder analyze the 50 states in terms of their economic freedom and their income inequality over 25 years ( from 1979 to 2004 ) . Bennett and Vedder define economic freedom as more or less the degree to which government is limited . They measured and ranked states according to the size of government , the level of taxation , and the level of labor market regulation . They define income inequality using the Gini coefficient . Because different states have radically different levels of economic freedom ( compare New York and North Dakota , for instance ) , the authors were able to draw on a wealth of data about relative economic freedom in 50 distinct economies .
The authors find a parabolic relationship between a state 's economic freedom and its income inequality . As states initially become more economically free , most of the gains go to the wealthy . But at a certain inflection point X , which 21 states had already hit by 2004 , the relationship shifts : past this point , as states become more free , income inequality declines .
But does income inequality decline because the rich lose wealth ( perhaps through fewer opportunities for crony capitalism ) , or because the gains from increasing economic freedom go primarily to the poor ? In “ Income Inequality and Economic Freedom in the U.S. States , ” Nathan J. Ashby and Russell S. Sobel find that it 's the latter .
Ashby and Sobel analyze the 48 states of the continental United States in terms of their economic freedom and the incomes of their poor , middle-class , and wealthy residents over 20 years ( from the early 1980s to the early 2000s ) . They use the same measure of economic freedom as Bennett and Vedder .
The authors find a strong positive correlation between a state 's economic freedom and the income level of the poorest 20 percent of residents . Freer states did better by their poor than less free ones . In particular , Ashby and Sobel found that increasing the economic freedom of a state by one unit ( equivalent to moving from 40th-freest state to 7thfreest-state ) increased the incomes of its poorest residents by 11 percent . By contrast , the same change increased the incomes of the richest quintile by just over a third of that ( 4.3 percent ) . The middle class also saw increases , greater than the rich but less than the poor . Increasing a state 's economic freedom by reducing taxation and regulation creates broadly shared prosperity across all quintiles . Their research helps explain why , as states become more economically free , their income inequality declines : The poor and the middle class see more gains than the wealthy .
But could n't this be a case of mistaken causality ? Maybe some states have less poverty because they have more natural resources . With less poverty , they need less government to help the poor , meaning they 're economically freer . But Ashby and Sobel anticipated this claim . They control for about a dozen variables , including education , geography , and median income . The last controlled variable is especially important ; it places richer and poorer states on a level playing field , so to speak , for the study . It combats the idea that perhaps wealthier states need less government because they have less poverty , and firmly points the arrow of causality toward economic freedom reducing poverty .
Ashby and Sobel 's research is a compelling argument against government poverty programs . Other research , for instance the Mercatus Center 's Freedom in the 50 States annual report , notes the positive effects of economic freedom on aggregate economic growth . But because their data is left in the aggregate , it 's difficult to determine to whom exactly the economic gains go . But by breaking down their research by quintile , Ashby and Sobel make a case that economic growth especially helps the poor .
Economic Freedom Worldwide
Nor is the connection between economic freedom and bottom-rung prosperity unique to the United States . Recent research in the Economic Freedom of the World ( EFW ) 2013 Annual Report finds the same trend internationally .
The Economic Freedom of the World ( EFW ) Annual Report , published by the Fraser Institute , analyzes around 150 countries in terms of factors like their economic freedom , closeness to a laissez-faire state , poverty levels , and per capita income . The results are a striking indictment of the idea that more government intervention in the economy can help the poor .
As EFW points out , the shares of a country 's GDP going to the bottom 10 percent are pretty consistent regardless of how free the country is . From communist states to progressive countries to almost laissez-faire societies , the poorest 10 percent of citizens receive about 2.5 percent of the country 's wealth . No amount of progressive policies has changed that number . But for the poor , life is still much better in an economically free country than in one with more government . More economically free countries have more wealth than less free ones , meaning the poorest 10 percent can end up with thousands of dollars more per year . The poorest citizens of the 25 percent most-free countries earn an average of $ 10,556 per year . The poorest citizens in the middle 50 percent of countries earn less than a third of that .
So why does more economic freedom mean less poverty ? The answers are well-known to libertarians , but worth reviewing . In societies with more economic freedom , decreased taxes and regulation make it easier to accumulate savings and to start or expand a business . Today in the United States , getting permits and navigating the legal maze to start a business can cost tens of thousands of dollars . Getting the permit for a food truck , and complying with the various laws , can cost $ 15,000 at the high end . Regulations in the United States overall cost about 1.5 percent of the country 's income per capita . But in other countries this cost is even higher ; in Germany regulations sap 4.7 percent of the nation 's income per capita . In Italy it 's 14.2 percent .
Some of these regulations drain money from existing corporations , leaving them with fewer funds to expand ; others impose hefty costs on anyone wishing to start a business . Both ultimately discourage wealth creation . Countries or states with more economic freedom therefore have more jobs , more innovation , and more goods and services—ultimately more wealth—than societies burdened by a heavy government .
As we approach the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty , legislators would do well to bear these data in mind . The cure for poverty is not more well-meaning government programs to make the United States resemble Europe . The solution , as it has always been , is more economic freedom .

Six-foot tall , the 'child ' accused of murdering a Swedish aid worker appeared in court today .
Somali-born Youssaf Khaliif Nuur , ‎charged with murdering Alexandra Mezher , 22 , towered over their translator as they walked into the courtroom in Gothenburg .
They were knifed to death as they tried to break up a fight at the shelter for unaccompanied child refugees where they worked alone in charge of ten youths .
Scroll down for video
First picture : Somali-born Youssaf Khaliif Nuur , 15 , pictured in court in Gothenburg today , is charged with murdering Swedish social worker Alexandra Mezher . At six foot tall , they towered over their translator when they walked into the courtroom in Gothenburg today
Killed : Miss Mezher ( left and right ) , 22 , described as an 'angel ' by their mother ( left ) , was fatally stabbed in the back and thigh at the asylum centre for young , unaccompanied migrants in Molndal , Sweden , on Monday morning . They died saving the life of another resident whom allegedly knife-wielding Khaliif Nuur was trying to kill , police sources said
They died saving the life of another resident whom allegedly knife-wielding Khaliif Nuur was trying to kill , police sources said . Swedish prosecutors admit they do not know if Somalian Khaliif Nuur , supposedly aged 15 , is their true identity .
Psychology graduate Miss Mezher had warned their mother they ‎was caring for 'big powerful guys ' aged up to 24 in the shelter for children aged 14 to 17 .
Children 's asylum applications are fast-tracked ‎in Sweden , prompting some grown men to lie and say they are teenagers . ‎Handcuffed Khaliif Nuur , looking older than their supposed 15 years , was ushered into court wearing a blanket over their head , a white T-shirt , light blue shirt and jeans.‎
Judge Henrik Andersson asked him : 'Are you Youssaf Khaliif Nuur ? ' and they nodded and said yes .
They asked if they wanted to make a statement regarding the charges of murder and attempted murder , and their lawyer Nicklas Unger said : 'My client does not want to express themselves in any way regarding the charges . '
They said their client objected to being held in custody , but prosecutor Linda Viking argued they might abscond or interfere with evidence if they were bailed .
The hearing then continued behind closed doors , and the alleged killer was ‎later remanded into custody until February 11 .
Hearing : Somalian Khaliif Nuur , supposedly aged 15 , towered over their translator during today 's court hearing where court papers showed prosecutors do not know their true identity . Children 's asylum applications are fast-tracked in Sweden so some men say they are teenagers
Killed : Psychology graduate Miss Mezher , was working alone on a night shift at the child migrant centre on the morning they died
Argument : Khaliif Nuur is being held in police custody at the high security Sahlgrenska University Hospital , Gothenburg , a psychiatric unit for patients with psychological and addiction issues . Miss Mezher was working at a shelter for unaccompanied child refugees ( pictured )
Outside court prosecutor Linda Viking said : 'The suspect has said they are 15 so that is what is charged as . But we are checking their date or birth and name to make sure they are accurate . '
They said they had arrived in Sweden last summer . Asked how they travelled , they said : ' I ca n't comment on that . '
A source close to the investigation told MailOnline : 'Youssaf Khaliif Nuur is older than 15 . You can see they have moustache and a beard . They shave but you can see they have facial hair .
'He is between 16 and 20 I believe . They are from Somalia . They left Africa less than a year ago . They have only recently arrived in Sweden . They spoke the Somalian language very well , ' they added .
The bloodshed happened at breakfast on Monday at the child shelter in Mölndal , a suburb of Gothenburg , where Miss Mezher was the only member of staff on duty .
Khaliif Nuur allegedly launched an unprovoked attack on another youth , and Miss Mezher intervened and was stabbed in the back and thigh , and died in hospital hours later . ‘ The murder started with an attack on another man , ' a source at Gothenburg Police told MailOnline today .
‘ There was an argument between the suspect and another resident at the hostel . I do n't know the reason for the argument between the two residents . But in some way this woman got between them . They were trying to break up the fight .
‘ This lady [ Alexandra Mezher ] tried to separate them and told them [ Youssaf Khaliif Nuur ] to stop but they [ allegedly ] stabbed her . '
Tragedy : A police officer in Sweden has told MailOnline the psychology graduate ( right ) died trying to break up a fight between two migrants on Monday morning . They were the only member of staff on duty at the shelter when the fight broke out
Court papers : Khaliif Nuur , 15 , appeared in court in Gothenburg today charged with murder and attempted murder . Court documents show the authorities have no proof that the suspect 's name is their true identity
Locked up : The suspect , Somali-born Youssaf Khaliif Nuur who is accused of murdering a Swedish aid worker , is being held at the high security psychiatric clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg . The facility is for patients with psychotic illnesses
The source dismissed any suggestion that the killing had a sexual motive . They added murder suspect Youssaf Khaliif Nuur , 15 , had complained of feeling ‘ unwell ' the night before and had not slept at all in the hours before the alleged attack .
The teenager is currently being held at a secure psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of Gothenburg .
The Gothenburg Police source told MailOnline : ‘ There was no sexual motive in the murder . This Somali man did not have a motive for the attack other than they were not feeling well . This lady tried to separate them and told them to stop but they stabbed them
‘ The suspect had been up all night . They had said they were not feeling well the night before . '
It has been suggested that Nuur has psychological issues and had a breakdown in the hours before the attack and complained of hearing voices in their head .
The source revealed : 'The knifeman may have had some kind of breakdown . They may have suffered some trauma previously in their life . '
The source said they were heard pacing around their bedroom for most of the night before the attack at 8am on Monday .
Managers of the adolescent migrant centre should not have let Miss Mezher work the night shift on their own if they knew one of the residents was suffering a mental health breakdown , the Gothenburg Police source claimed .
They told MailOnline : ‘ If the management of the centre knew that one of the residents was not [ mentally ] well [ they ] should have got in extra staff to help them that night . '
The source , who has worked for Gothenburg Police for over 30 years , has detailed the ‘ explosion in crime ' in the Swedish city since the country ‘ threw open the doors ' to mass immigration .
Life taken : Alexandra 's mother said their daughter ( second from left ) had been warned four hours before they started their last shift that a knife had been stolen from the kitchen , but nothing was apparently done . They were working alone in charge of ten youths
They told MailOnline : ‘ We have experienced an explosion in crime , particularly violent crime , since our politicians threw open the doors to immigrants from all over the world . I have worked in Gothenburg for over 30 years and I have never known anything like it .
‘ The city always had a bit of trouble , but it was usually among people who were drunk and knew each other .
‘ But now I will not let my children go into the city after 2pm and especially not at night . There are violent gangs roaming around the streets and the use of knives and other weapons have become normal , rather than a rarity as it used to be .
‘ There are 20 robberies in Gothenburg every day – usually with violence or the threat of violence . This week an 83-year-old lady had a gun put in their face when they were mugged on their way to play bingo . They got away with just 50 Kroner [ about £4 ] .
‘ In the summer there were mass shootings with lots of people killed , including a little girl . ' They added the city streets were now at the mercy of gangs of young men mainly from North Africa .
The source revealed : ‘ In the past couple of months we have noticed a dramatic increase in street robbery . This is a new phenomenon .
‘ They will do anything to get money – steal a person 's wallet , iPhone , jewellery . And then they will attack their victim and kick them half to death .
‘ Drug crime has gone through the roof . Every drug is available on the street nowadays , even in broad daylight . And when the police arrest someone nowadays the suspect often fights back – with a knife or a screwdriver . This is not something we have seen before . '
Hardworking : Psychology graduate Miss Mezher , who was a Lebanese Christian whose parents were from Beirut , was described by their mother Chiméne as an 'angel ' . They were stabbed to death while working a night shift alone at a centre for migrant children

Of the many reboots , sequels and remakes revitalizing long-dormant franchises , Blade Runner 2 might be the most unexpected and promising . Denis Villeneuve will direct the screenplay by Hampton Fancher ( who co-wrote the original ) and Michael Green based on an original idea from Fancher and Ridley Scott . And not only does the film have a solid new lead in the form of Ryan Gosling , Harrison Ford will reprise their iconic role as Rick Deckard . As the cherry on top of the awesome sunday , legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins , who previously collaborated with Villeneuve on Sicario and Prisoners , will shoot the film ensuring that , if nothing else , it will be absolutely gorgeous .
We 've known for a while that Blade Runner 2 would move into production sometime this summer , but today brings the news that filming will officially begin in July . The news comes with the announcement that Sony Pictures has landed international distribution rights for the film ( Warner Bros. will distribute in North America through their deal with Alcon ) .
Naturally , plot details are still being kept tightly under wraps . We know that the film will pick up decades after the ending of the first and , as stated above , that Ford is returning as Deckard — a fact that seemingly flies in the face of theories they were a replicant . Otherwise , Blade Runner 2 remains a mystery .
What do you guys think ? How would you like to re-enter the dismal future of replicants and hunters ? Any wildly speculative theories on who Ryan Gosling might play ? Still not sold on the idea of a sequel at all ? Sounds off in the comments with your thoughts .

The main issue is whether to ban Communist symbols such as the red star , which is also a symbol of antifascist struggle during the Second World War .
At the beginning of the yesterday 's session of the government , Prime Minister Andrej Plenković spoke about a memorial to fallen soldiers of HOS at Jasenovac . The memorial has recently been in the focus of attention , since it contains a logo which includes the inscription “ Za Dom Spremni ” ( “ For Homeland Ready ” ) , which was used during the Second World War by the Independent State of Croatia , a puppet state established by Germans and Italians . Jasenovac was the location of a large concentration camp where over 80,000 Jews , Serbs and antifascist Croats were killed during the Second World War , reports Novi List and Večernji List on December 9 , 2016 .
“ The Croatian government expresses reverence for all the victims of Jasenovac , as well as for the Croatian veterans who lost their lives there during the Homeland War . We are aware of the sensitivity aroused by the symbol , however , such symbols were approved in the past , at institutional and government level ” , said Plenković . They pointed out different rulings issued by the courts related to the symbols of totalitarian systems and announced that the government would establish a committee to consider the issue in a calm and rational way . The goal is to adopt an acceptable legal solution , in order to determine the position of the society towards the symbols of totalitarian regimes , said Plenković .
The memorial in Jasenovac has caused uproar among NGOs and liberal political parties , which claim that it is unacceptable to use the “ Za Dom Spremni ” slogan anywhere , and particularly at the site of the largest concentration camp in Croatia . On the other hand , rightwing associations demand that communist symbols should be banned instead , given the atrocities committed by communist regime after the Second World War .
So far , there are absolutely no details about how a possible law on banning the symbols of totalitarian regimes would look like , whether their usage would be considered to be a crime or a misdemeanor , and who will draft the proposal . Sources say that the law should identify a five-pointed star as a symbol of communism , but they do note that it is also a symbol of antifascist struggle and that its ban would spark a revolt .
“ After the state budget is adopted , we will begin work on this law . Relationship towards symbols of totalitarianisms can be part of the criminal law , but also of the misdemeanor law , or it can be a special law ” , said a source . They noted that they would study legal provisions of other countries when it comes to symbols of totalitarianism .
However , the source believes that politicians are again dealing with topics which divide the public and which are part of the past . “ The major complaint to the previous HDZ leadership was that they spoke too much about the past , and now we are reopening the topic which does not offer easy answers ” , said a source from HDZ .
Faced with question how the government would react to the memorial in Jasenovac , Prime Minister Plenković recently said that , 70 years after the end of the Second World War , it was about time to finally determine the position towards totalitarian regimes and their symbols .
One of the problems for those advocating for the ban on the red star is the fact that the current Croatian Constitution determines that Croatia as it now exists was founded as part of the antifascist struggle during the Second World War , whose symbol was the red star . Also , Franjo Tuđman , the first president of independent Croatia , revered by those on the right , was a high-ranking member of Yugoslav partisans at the time , and fought against fascists wearing a red star on their cap .
Excerpts Human Kinetics / News and Excerpts / Excerpts Drills to improve running from This is an excerpt from Running Anatomy by Joe Puleo and Dr. Patrick Milroy . ABC Running Drills Other than with strength training , how can running form and performance be improved ? Because running has a neuromuscular component , running form can be improved through form drills that coordinate the movements of the involved anatomy . The drills , developed by coach Gerard Mach in the 1950s , are simple to perform and cause little impact stress to the body . Essentially , the drills , commonly referred to as the ABCs of running , isolate the phases of the gait cycle : knee lift , upper leg motion , and pushoff . By isolating each phase and slowing the movement , the drills , when properly performed , aid the runner 's kinesthetic sense , promote neuromuscular response , and emphasize strength development . A properly performed drill should lead to proper running form because the former becomes the latter , just at a faster velocity . Originally these drills were designed for sprinters , but they can be used by all runners . Drills should be performed once or twice a week and can be completed in 15 minutes . Focus on proper form . A Motion The motion ( figure 3.2 ; the movement can be performed while walking or more dynamically as the A skip or A run ) is propelled by the hip flexors and quadriceps . Knee flexion occurs , and the pelvis is rotated forward . The arm carriage is simple and used to balance the action of the lower body as opposed to propelling it . The arm opposite to the raised leg is bent 90 degrees at the elbow , and it swings forward and back like a pendulum , the shoulder joint acting as a fulcrum . The opposite arm is also moving simultaneously in the opposite direction . Both hands should be held loosely at the wrist joints and should not be raised above shoulder level . The emphasis is on driving down the swing leg , which initiates the knee lift of the other leg .
B Motion The B motion ( figure 3.3 ) is dependent on the quadriceps to extend the leg and the hamstrings to drive the leg groundward , preparing for the impact phase . In order , the quadriceps extend the leg from the position of the A motion to potential full extension , and then the hamstrings group acts to forcefully drive the lower leg and foot to the ground . During running the tibialis anterior dorsiflexes the ankle , which positions the foot for the appropriate heel landing ; however , while performing the B motion , dorsiflexion should be minimized so that the foot lands closer to midstance . This allows for less impact solely on the heel , and because the biomechanics of the foot are not involved as in running , it does not promote any forefoot injuries . C Motion The final phase of the running gait cycle is dominated by the hamstrings . Upon impact , the hamstrings continue to contract , not to limit the extension of the leg but to pull the foot upward , under the glutes , to begin another cycle . The emphasis of this exercise ( figure 3.4 ) is to pull the foot up , directly under the buttocks , shortening the arc and the length of time performing the phase so that another stride can be commenced . This exercise is performed rapidly , in staccato-like bursts . The arms are swinging quickly , mimicking the faster movement of the legs , and the hands come a little higher and closer to the body than in either the A or B motions . A more pronounced forward lean of the torso , similar to the body position while sprinting , helps to facilitate this motion . This is an excerpt from Running Anatomy .

We 're often are asked how long a person should wait between applying the various products in their daily skincare routine . Given the variety of products you can use to make a significant difference in the appearance of your skin , it 's a logical question ! We have a simple answer you 're sure to love : You do n't have to wait !
If you 're using gentle , well-formulated skincare products ( and you should be ) , then in most circumstances , waiting is more about personal preference than necessity .

Can Skin Handle So Many Products All At Once ?
The reason you do n't have to wait is that everything you apply is going to easily absorb and do its job of taking great care of your skin . No product is going to get in the way of another product 's ability to permeate into skin or interfere with its efficacy .
Skin can easily handle many beneficial ingredients all at once . In fact , because each ingredient has a unique benefit , it would be a mistake not to give your skin all it requires to look smoother , hydrated , younger , more even toned , clearer , and less red , among many other skincare concerns .
Ultimately , it 's more about the product feel and your preference than being about how many products you are using or how the products absorb or set . Some people just like the feel of waiting between skincare steps , while others prefer layering one product right after the other . You can even choose to mix the various products you use in the palm of their hand before applying .
All of those options are just fine , with the major takeaway being you do n't have to wait . Your skincare routine can be quickly applied !

What About AHA and BHA Exfoliants ?
Many people are worried about whether they can apply their other skincare products immediately after applying their AHA or BHA exfoliant but you can relax : A well-formulated exfoliant will work perfectly well regardless of what you apply over it or how soon you apply it .
The concern some people have is that the other products they apply will change the AHA or BHA 's pH , thus diluting and altering its efficacy . To describe this a bit more technically , the pH of a product does n't shift that fast , especially when the other skincare products you are applying also have an acidic pH ( which the products you use should be , as skin 's pH is naturally acidic ) or a pH of 7 , which is neutral .
A Few Exceptions
There are always a few exceptions to every guideline , but in this case they 're pretty minor :
If you notice that a combination of products you 're using tends to roll or ball up when you apply one right after the other , then it 's probably best to allow the first product to dry before applying the next product in your routine . Because sunscreen always needs to be the last skincare product you apply , it 's a good idea to allow a few minutes for it to set before you apply your makeup . If your foundation or tinted moisturizer contains sunscreen and is rated SPF 30 or greater , then there 's no need to wait . ( And we love when you layer sunscreens with a moisturizer and foundation that both have SPF 30 or greater ratings to assure you 're applying sunscreen liberally ) . When you have blemishes and use a benzoyl peroxide based product as a treatment to get the problem under control it is best to wait until it absorbs before applying serums and/or moisturizers . Benzoyl peroxide works better when it has had time to absorb by itself . This only takes a few seconds so it is n't a huge time drain .
Not having to wait between applying skincare products will definitely be easier and save you time . It will also allow you to experiment with adding one of our boosters and serums to your skincare routine . These helpful additions wo n't add much time and will definitely benefit your skin .

This Star Trek scene from 1968 still illustrates our dominant view of the future . Photo by CBS via Getty Images
This piece is part of Future Tense , a partnership of Slate , New America , and Arizona State University . On Thursday , Oct. 2 , Future Tense will host an event in Washington , D.C. , on science fiction and public policy , inspired by the new anthology Hieroglyph : Stories & Visions for a Better Future . For more information on the event and to RSVP , visit the New America website ; for more on Hieroglyph , visit the website of ASU 's Project Hieroglyph .
Why are all our narratives about the future 50 years old ? We seem to be recycling big ideas as if we live in an inspiration drought . We 've retooled Star Trek so many times , it 's starting to look like one of those 1957 Chevrolets still cruising the streets of Havana .
One reason is that writing about the near future is hard to do convincingly . Imagining life 10 or 20 years down the road requires placing the same big bets that science fiction always makes ( in the future , we will all wear matching leotards ! ) but provides an incredibly short runway to get from now to then .
Storytellers can play it safe by depending on tropes that we have already been trained to expect : In the future people will use phasers and doors will swish open with a satisfying noise . We make a comfortable nest of assumptions and “ rules , ” allowing everyone to get on with the tale of young love or the hero 's journey .
But the trouble with stories is that they do n't stay in their fictional boxes : A good science fiction narrative will change your thinking about the world . Isaac Asimov 's robot stories have come to shape the whole idea of the robot in important ways , and that means robotics researchers are grappling with Asimov 's Three Laws .
This was the thinking behind a book I co-edited with Kathryn Cramer , Hieroglyph : Stories and Visions for a Better Future , which brings writers , scientists , and engineers together to create near-future narratives that are technically possible . ( Project Hieroglyph is hosted by the Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State University , and Future Tense is a partnership among Slate , the New America Foundation , and Arizona State University . ) The idea was to look for ideas strange and ambitious enough that they would open a new conversation about the future while staying relatively close to the cutting edge of real innovation . So the most far-fetched thing about Cory Doctorow 's story of Burning Man hackers crowdsourcing money for a lunar 3-D printer robot is not the idea of printing bricks out of moon dust . NASA and the European Space Agency have been putting research dollars into the problem for years . Lee Konstantinou 's tale of dronepunks launching their own flying Internet is not so different from Google 's Project Loon and probably-not-coincidental purchase of Titan Aerospace , or even art performances using the same idea . Untangling science from science fiction can quickly become a robot chicken and Alien egg problem .
Steering the radical collaborations and weird conversations of Hieroglyph toward publication has made me realize something about how we talk about the future now . It 's tremendously important to nourish the feedback loop between popular imagination and technical innovation—but we ca n't keep shuffling the same ideas back and forth over the transom . Many of those conversations do n't just share memes but also tools : Hollywood special effects have depended for years on the same kinds of high-end computer modeling that physicists , mathematicians , and other researchers used to solve technical problems . Film design gets cited in patent disputes over product design . And then there 's James Cameron , explorer of real and invented abysses .
But the issue is not sharing tools—it 's the limited pool of metaphors behind those tools . Right now , almost everyone is working from the same conceptual playbook . All of these engineers watched Star Trek ( or grokked its core ideas through cultural osmosis ) , which is a big part of why Google engineers keep talking about building the Star Trek computer—everyone knows what they mean . It 's why the X Prize Foundation wants someone to build a Tricorder .
Do n't get me wrong , I 'm a big fan of the X Prize Foundation and Cameron 's submarining ; the ambitious , creative way they approach the future is a wonderful thing . But should we be worried that so many of our blueprints for the future are now decades old ? Are we giving our scientists and technologists the best possible toolkit of language , metaphor , and wild ideas ?
The fact that we are all so steeped in the same shorthand of the future ( intelligent robots ; warp drive ; retinal displays ) is a hint that we 've become complacent about our dreams . The stories we tell about the near future have become homogeneous and standardized . There are a handful of persistent narratives in Hollywood films and genre fiction about what the world will look like , much like the futuristic guns , helmets , and other props that get recycled from set to set . We all know the most popular of these stories : Inequality , social collapse , and chaos have been spilling into pop culture from Mad Max to Elysium . Sure , there are variations : climate change or aliens , Soylent Green or The Matrix . But they share a common aesthetic and cynicism . Then there are the flawed utopias ( Logan 's Run , The Truman Show , Minority Report ) , the Frankenstein stories ( Robocop , Her , Alien ) , and a handful of others . The optimistic visions might even be more consistent , like the sleek Jetsons future with those long-awaited flying cars . The most successful one is Star Trek ( leotards ! ) , which by this point has inspired generations of engineers and scientists .
So how do we expand the possibility space ? How do we dream up fresh visions of the future that break out of the overplayed myths I 've described above ? Well , I 'll be honest with you : We ca n't escape them entirely . Some ideas are just too sticky , too successful—like Asimov 's robots or the U.S.S . Enterprise—to put out of cultural consciousness completely . But instead of rehashing and rebooting old futures with endless sequels , we can try to come up with new ideas that are just as bold , original , and iconic . If we want new futures that grapple with 21st-century problems , from climate change to war and politics in the era of ISIS , Twitterbots , and super PACS , we 're going to need some fresh thinking .
SALT LAKE CITY — University of Utah President David Pershing , one of the key figures at the center of a controversy over the Huntsman Cancer Institute director 's firing , said Monday they plan to resign and has asked the state board of regents to immediately begin searching for their replacement .
`` I think it 's the best possible way to get from where we are now into the future , '' Pershing said .
Addressing faculty and staff at a campus meeting , Pershing said they are not stepping down because of the recent firestorm over the dismissal of Huntsman Cancer Institute Director and CEO Mary Beckerle , whom they played a role in firing by email on April 17 .
Pershing said they initially planned to step down by the end of the 2017-18 school year , but now the preferred timeline is simply as soon as possible because they want their replacement to be able to recruit their or their own candidate for the crucial position of senior vice president of health sciences .
`` I do n't think at this particularly critical time it 's in our interest to have interim leadership ( hiring for that position ) , '' they said .
That post was vacated Friday by the resignation of Dr. Vivian Lee following more than a week of uproar over the decision they and Pershing made to fire Beckerle . Lee also resigned Friday from their positions as dean of the U . Medical School and CEO of University of Utah Health .
U. spokesperson Chris Nelson said Pershing decided they wanted to retire well before the public rift between the cancer institute and the university — perhaps as far back as December . Pershing initially planned to announce their resignation in August but decided to let faculty know sooner when the likely end of their tenure was moved up .
Pershing never planned to serve much longer than they have , and their presidency at the U. was never a stepping stone to another position , according to Nelson . Pershing 's life plan , they said , was initially to finish their presidency slightly later — around the end of the 2017-18 school year — and the revised timeline has had no effect on their desire to remain at the U. as a professor .
Pointed questions
Pershing also addressed several pointed questions from faculty members about Lee 's resignation during Monday 's meeting with the university 's Academic Senate . They told the faculty they wanted to make it `` crystal clear '' that they never asked for Lee 's resignation .
`` I was actually in shock as many of you in this room were , '' they said . `` I did n't see this coming . I am grateful for everything they have done . ''
Pershing heaped praise on Lee , calling them instrumental in building the prestigious reputation of the university 's medical school .
`` There is no doubt that they have moved our health sciences side of the campus in very positive ways , '' they said .
Pershing also praised Jon Huntsman Sr. for their role in assisting Huntsman Cancer Institute . But they expressed regret at Huntsman 's public comments calling for them and Lee to be fired , saying the public rift was `` ugly . ''
Nadia Cobb , an associate professor in the University of Utah 's Department of Family Preventive Medicine , told Pershing she 's worried that the reinstatement of Beckerle could send a message that large donors are allowed to have undue influence going forward .
“ I think there are perceptions now that wealthy donors have the ability to really determine … how things are done , ” they said . “ That is a great concern . ”
Cobb said they are also worried about the “ character assassination ” of Lee through Huntsman 's media blitz , including full-page advertisements in the Deseret News and Salt Lake Tribune calling the university administration “ bloated . ”
Pershing responded that Huntsman 's pressure was not what motivated them to reinstate Beckerle .
“ I did not reverse the decision because of any donor , ” they said . “ I reversed the decision because I came to the conclusion that it was not in the best interest of university faculty . ”
In the aftermath of Beckerle 's firing , Huntsman angrily called Lee a “ vicious , vitriolic ” woman and said they wanted them fired . Prior to Beckerle 's reinstatement , they also said they wanted Pershing fired , saying they “ should have been let go a long time ago . ”
Huntsman reversed their position after the reinstatement , saying they had discovered the U. president was given bad information and that they hoped Pershing would remain in the position “ for many years . ”
However , when contacted about Lee 's resignation , Huntsman said they are n't sorry to see them go .
Cobb added that they are worried that the university did not come to Lee 's defense as strongly as it should have .
“ There should be some sort of communication now publicly that ( what was said about her ) is not OK , ” they said .

Dr. Vivian Lee resigns post at University of Utah Dr. Vivian Lee , the CEO of University of Utah Health who was at the center of a heated controversy for the firing of the Huntsman Cancer Institute director last week , resigned Friday .
Pershing replied by saying they were doing their best to not instigate any additional fights in the media and that they had to “ sort of negotiate the cease-fire , which I did . ”
“ I ca n't control what the newspaper publishes . That 's the newspaper 's businesses , ” Pershing said . “ I am in a very tricky place because I am the guy who is trying not to throw gasoline on this fire . ”
Dr. Antoinette Laskey , an associate professor and division chief at the Center for Safe and Healthy Families at the U. , said they felt Lee took the lion 's share of the blame for a decision that was also made with the blessing of Pershing and the U. board of trustees .
`` When there was a reversal ( of Beckerle 's firing ) , it was Dr. Lee who was left as the one responsible , '' said Laskey , who also practices as a clinical doctor at Primary Children 's Hospital . `` Dr. Lee was being thrown under the bus regardless of what the reality was . Dr. Lee was left holding the bag . ''
Pershing replied that they never intended for Lee to become a lightning rod for those who were angry about Beckerle being fired .
`` I have never done that , and I 'm not about to do that today , '' they said . `` It was not my intention to throw Dr. Lee under the bus at that time , or any other time . ''
'We did n't do it right '
Pershing said they did n't do a good job of handling the different visions of health sciences and Huntsman Cancer Institute .
`` It 's really hard to get this to work out perfectly , '' they said . `` Was this conflict handled correctly ? No , absolutely not . I get that that is on me . … I apologize for that . We did n't do it right . We did n't do it in a correct way . ''
Pershing also acknowledged that there was disunity between Huntsman Cancer Institute and the U. medical school for `` many months '' prior to Beckerle 's firing .
`` I want to be clear that has nothing to do with the quality of health care that we 're providing or the quality of research that many of you in this room are conducting , '' they said .
Pershing fielded some other heated questions about whether they would prioritize being transparent to U. faculty more so than to university donors . But the question and answer session Monday was largely civil .
Pershing was also praised by some faculty members for making the decision to bring Beckerle back . They received applause at the end of their remarks .
Following Pershing 's announcement , the state board of regents and Utah Commissioner of Higher Education David Buhler released statements expressing gratitude for the U. president .
`` He has always put students and the university first , '' Buhler said . `` He will be missed as president , but I am grateful they are not leaving the university family and will remain as faculty . ”
Board of regents chairperson Daniel Campbell said Pershing made `` a lasting mark '' on the university .
“ His visionary leadership as president of Utah 's flagship university over the past five years has been extraordinary , '' Campbell said . `` We are grateful that they will remain as president until the search is concluded . ”
Pershing 's announcement also prompted a response from Gov . Gary Herbert .
`` He has championed significant improvements in STEM education and guided major campus improvements that will bless the lives of students for decades to come , '' Herbert said in a prepared statement .

I see a lot of pitches writing for Pitcher List . For every pitch that gets turned into a GIF , there are dozens more that just did n't make the cut . Through this constant exposure I slowly develop crushes that leave me fanning myself like I 'm attending church in the south . Did you see how much fade that Changeup had ? Is that a Curveball at 89 MPH ? ! These affinities rarely stick after subsequent starts , but there was one who I found myself dying to inspect on each visit to the mound despite being seemingly overshadowed by the deGroms and Kershaws of the world :
Noah Syndergaard . ( I realize I gave that away in the title of this article , but let 's act like you did n't see it coming . )
Most pitchers that we featured had one instance of their best pitch that makes you giddy like Christmas day , such as Chaz Roe 's Slider or Steven Wright 's Knuckleball , but with Syndergaard , it seemed as though every start produced the same jaw-dropping ability that makes me question the true nature of their Norse God comparisons . While their secondary pitches are above-average in their own right , their Four-Seamer and – more importantly – Sinker were radiant .
To set the mood , let 's equivocate the Barry White and candles with some eye candy . First is a 99 MPH Four-Seamer that hits the spot so well you can see a puff of smoke from Travis d'Arnuad 's glove :
And allow me to pair that with an elegant Sinker that does…well , this :
In case you missed it – and let 's be honest , you watched it at least five times like I did – that was a 98 MPH Sinker off the outside corner with sweet sweet movement . How much movement exactly ? Thor averaged around 7 inches of horizontal ride on their Sinker , about 4.5 inches more than their Four-Seamer .
In case you 've forgotten , let 's compare the two pitches once more . First we have a perfectly placed Four-Seamer to a frustrated Anthony Rendon ( and yes , I mean perfectly placed ) :
Followed by this triple-digit Sinker that debilitated Freddie Freeman in late September :
Both pitches are mesmerizing in their own right , but I have a feeling a thought has crept into your mind . If Syndergaard can throw a Sinker with identical velocity but much better horizontal movement , why would n't they throw that all the time ? That 's a great question – so good , in fact , that it seems Noah had the same thought .
By the time the post-season arrived , Syndergaard was throwing their Sinker 33.2 % of the time , while dropping their Four-Seamer from a 39.59 % usage in May all the way down to 23.5 % in their final month . Their stat lines improved as a result , boasting a 12.5 K/9 , a 2.76 ERA , and an even 1.00 WHIP across five appearances in October . But exactly how effective was their Sinker through Thor 's entire rookie season ? Let 's dive into some more numbers and I promise we 'll jump back to the fun stuff shortly .
Among pitchers with at least 150 innings this season ( post-season not included ) , Syndergaard held the 7th highest Runs Above Average total for Sinkers at 3.6 while throwing it only 23.4 % of the time . Outside of Jake Arrieta , who collected an absurd 21.5 RAA tally and is well known to be synonymous with unfathomable talent , every other pitcher had to throw their Sinker well above 50.0 % of the time to score higher than Thor – in plenty more innings as well . Thor 's average Sinker velocity of 97.0 MPH also sat nearly two points higher than Brandon Morrow ‘ s 95.1 MPH mark in second place , blowing the competition out of the water .
So yeah , the pitch is really good . Like throw up your hands in a “ today is not my day like I 'm Anthony Rendon ” kind of good . Now here 's one more fun fact . The pitch was at its best in October .
When the time came for Syndergaard to dominate in October , their Sinker displayed a whiff rate of 15.28 % , crushing their previous month high of 10.89 % in July . Additionally , batters held a poor .212 batting average against their Sinker , while limiting the extra bases hits with just a 0.273 Slugging Against . That 's just a .061 ISO . And here is how it looked :
Syndergaard was hurling their Sinker at 99 MPH and still getting their absurd movement as they struck out Miguel Montero in the NLCS . But it did n't stop there . In the last days of the 2015 postseason , Thor was at their best . For those that skipped Game 3 of the World Series , here is what you missed :
Are you kidding ? ! I just do n't know how anyone is supposed to hit that . Really . And yes , I know Thor allowed three runs in the first two innings , whoop-de-doo . Do n't care .
So there it is , one of the more underrated pitches in the majors that we can all sit back and enjoy now that the 2015 season has come to close . It 's a shame the year ended for Syndergaard right when they seemed to be getting into their stride , but at least we have these GIFs to hint at how bright Thor 's future can be . Hint : It 's really bright .
Yesterday was one of the tough days for me -- we 've all had them -- when students seemed to push back on every choice I made , I felt boxed into a lesson I did n't love , frustration mounted for all of us , my patience ebbed , and pride flowed . The whole endeavor of teaching and learning seemed to hang by a slender thread .
But that thread must be woven of something other-worldly -- of unicorn hair and phoenix feathers -- because it finds a way to hold every time . That thread tugs , eventually , at the best of who I am and how I want to be . It makes me find a better way .
And that 's how I 've come to look at , and love , teaching . It 's not easy , ever . Not when the world at large and powers-that-be seem distant and tone deaf to what children and schools need from society . Not when there is n't close to enough time to plan and prepare to teach as I 'd want to ideally . But if I accept that those tensions are there to stay , I can find a way to work through them . And that 's what I 've decided to do .
I love teaching because the obstacle of those tensions ( and others ) are an opportunity for me to grow my grace . Constrictions from curriculum , policy , and testing implore me to scheme for ways to still give kids choice and creativity as they learn . Complaints from students can be seen , as Dylan Wiliam says , as invitations to strengthen relationships , as invitations to listen and lean in to difficult conversations . And both are opportunities for me to grow -- in prioritizing and being creative , in emotional intelligence , in empathy , in being vulnerable enough to seek feedback .
This Is Where I 'm Going To Make A Difference
I love teaching because I get to do this work alongside some of the most giving and dedicated people on the planet . My school community recently celebrated the life of a colleague who gave 46 years of compassion and kindness to students benefiting from special education . We all know someone like that , someone who has just made a decision to plant their flag and say , “ this is where I 'm going to make a difference . One kid , one heart , one human at a time . ”
In classrooms -- just like ours -- across the world , a teacher stays late to give a little extra feedback to move a student forward . Another sits listening to a child in need . Another runs through red tape to make an opportunity come to life . We know this . We 're not in this alone . We 're in this with an army of agents of grace and love and possibility .
I love teaching because of an idea put in my mind by Marian Wright Edelman in Stand For Children : “ That when God wants an important thing done in the world , or a wrong righted , They go about it in a very singular way . They do n't release thunderbolts or stir up earthquakes . God simply has a tiny baby born , perhaps of a very humble home , perhaps of a very humble mother . And they put it in the baby 's mind , and then -- God waits . The great events of this world are not battles and elections and earthquakes and thunderbolts . The great events are babies. ” And those babies come to pass through our classrooms -- yours and mine . And if we consider the preciousness and possibility of their lives , that is an incredible honor and responsibility .
I love teaching because my tough yesterday was still with me this morning . And I got up and got to work at getting better , so those students could get better . And I know thousands of other teachers did the same thing , too .
It 's from this place , with a shared desire to shine a light on all that is positive about teaching , that WeLoveTeaching.org was born . Join us this week as we celebrate our profession and , once again , share with the world why we # LoveTeaching .

Reported sexual assaults in the US military rose by 8 % this year to 5,983 , with nearly two-thirds of those who reported saying they faced retaliation .
The total number of troops saying they faced unwanted sexual contact fell , from 26,000 in 2012 to 19,000 in 2014 .
Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said a three-year crackdown on sexual assault was showing `` real progress '' but there was still `` a long way to go '' .
The figures come from an anonymous survey conducted by the Pentagon .
Of the 19,000 overall people who said they had experienced unwanted sexual contact , about 10,500 were men and 8,500 women .
Pentagon officials said the rise in the number of cases that were actually reported was encouraging , showing that more people were willing to come forward .
But they expressed concern that 62 % of female victims said they faced repercussions for reporting assaults .
Mr Hagel said the issue of retaliation should be tackled `` head on '' .
`` When someone reports a sexual assault , they need to be embraced and helped , not ostracised or punished with retribution . ''
Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand , a prominent campaigner for victims of sexual assault , said the fact that the rate of retaliation had not fallen should be `` a screaming red flag to everyone '' .
Ms Gillibrand has been pushing for reform of the military justice system , and for transferring the authority to prosecute sex assault cases to an independent military prosecutor .
The official website for the Yuri ! ! ! on Ice television anime series revealed the character designs , story , key visual , and October premiere on Friday .

Economist 's Defense Of Perpetual Copyright : It 's Best To Just Ignore The Economics
from the wait , -really ? dept
We do n't actually go after rents in the tax system . No one tries to remove the 90 % of rents that people get if they 're top basketball players . No one says 'well , gee , Charles Barkley , back in the day , when they were doing it , or Michael Jordan , or anybody now , we should have taken 90 % of their income away , because it was all rent . ' So the textbook says we should and it would be efficient if we could , if we 're just looking to generate revenues for the government . But there 's no practical application of actually trying to do any of that .
The one place in policy where we can do something like that , is something like copyright . Because in copyright we can control the length or duration of the copyright , which largely controls the amount of rents that the creative individuals get . Now , it 's an average , but that 's something that we can do for them , that we ca n't do for almost any other occupation . And that 's sort of the difference here . So we 're talking about efficiency in terms of copyright . And what 's different here is that the ownership rights that the copyright holder is given is not permanent , it 's temporary . And we control how long it lasts by the law . Every other type of ownership , to a large extent , is not considered temporary , and you get to keep ownership as long as it stays in your property or your heirs ' property .
Jerry Brito ( JB ) : Let 's say you wrote a book , and I want to use my printing press to make a copy of it . I ca n't do that .
Stan Liebowitz ( SL ) : Right . Not without getting permission .
JB : Precisely .
SL : Absolutely . That 's what copyright does . But that 's essentially a property right . You ca n't come and use my car without my permission . That 's what property rights do .
JB : Sure , but the reason we might want to cut off the rent in the copyright space , where we just want to cut it off where they 've earned enough to induce them , whereas we would n't want to do that for basketball players , is simply that , in the copyright space , you 're limiting what I can do with my property . My physical property . My printing press . I ca n't use my printing press to make a copy of your book . It 's affecting me . Whereas Michael Jordan performing well , does n't really affect me one way or the other .
SL : Well , you can print anything you get the rights to print . I do n't think it affects your freedom any more than it restricts your freedom to drive my car whenever you want to .
JB : No , but when I drive your car , then you ca n't drive it . But if I use my printing press to make copies of your book , you still have your book .
SL : I no longer have the earning capacity that I have from writing the story .
JB : Which is why we have copyright . And the question is at what point should it end ?
SL : That 's right . And you 're talking about the non-rivalrous consumption aspect of intellectual property .
JB : Exactly . At what point should the limit on my freedom be lifted ?
SL : Because it 's an issue where you want to have the freedom to generate revenues from an item that I created . That 's one aspect of it . I 'm not sure we should give you that freedom , just as we should n't give you the freedom to sell my car . I mean yes it 's true that one 's rivalrous and one 's not rivalrous . But I create the story . Why should you be allowed to generate revenues on a story that I created ?
JB : I guess I 'm ...
SL : What does that have to do with your freedom ? We do view the property right differently on copyright than we do on other items , but I 'm not sure we should . You claim there 's a difference in freedom and I 'm saying , 'no , just as you ca n't take my car without my permission , I do n't see why you should be able to take my story without my permission . '
JB : Let 's not get too deep into this , but I 'd simply say ...
SL : I mean you want the freedom to steal , is what you 're saying .
JB : Well , no ...
SL : It infringes on your freedom .
JB : No , no , no ...
SL : If you consider an item , and we 'll say let 's treat it like other property , then yes , my story is my story . And you want to steal it .
Under a regime of competitive production of reproductions ( no copyright ) , the equilibrium price of a reproduction is Pc ( equal to marginal cost , MC ) and the quantity of reproductions purchased is Qc . There is no profit earned in the market for reproductions since the market is assumed to be competitive .
Let 's remember that the key point I 'm trying to make is one that is not particularly amenable to economic analysis . I do n't deny that it 's efficient to sort of weaken copyright to a certain balancing point . What I 'm saying is that we can do that , we have the tools to do that , and no one finds it particularly morally objectionable to weaken copyright to get to what is the proper balance . The point of my paper is that if we were doing it the way we 're saying we would like to , we would be removing rents from the creators of copyrighted works , because that 's how you get the balance that 's most efficient . But we do n't go reducing rents elsewhere in the economy , say from basketball players .

A number of people have asked and speculated about why the company I co-founded , Wesabe , shut down earlier this summer . Some of the claims or guesses about it are just factually wrong ; others seem misinformed to me ; others seem to have some truth . I thought I 'd add my own opinion .
In November 2006 , Wesabe launched as a site to help people manage their personal finances . We certainly were n't the first to try to tackle this problem through a web app , but we were the first of a new wave of companies that came out in the months that followed , characterized but what some would call a Web 2.0 approach to the problem . Like Flickr and del.icio.us , we relied on community and features such as tags ; unlike some of the previous attempts , we tried to automatically aggregate and store all of our users ' financial accounts on the web ( instead of relying on manual data entry , say , or desktop storage of the data ) ; and most especially , we tried to learn from the accumulated data our users uploaded , and make recommendations for better financial decisions based on that data . If every copy of Quicken started out as a blank spreadsheet , Wesabe tried to accumulate knowledge from users and data that would fill in some of that spreadsheet for you , and point you in the direction of better choices .
Even before we launched , we heard about other people working on similar ideas , and a slew of companies soon launched in our wake . None of them really seemed to get very far , though , and we were considered the leader in online personal finance until September 2007 , when Mint launched at , and won , the first TechCrunch 40 conference . From that point forward we were considered in second place at best , and they overshadowed our site and everyone else 's , too . Two years later , Mint was acquired by Intuit , makers of Quicken ( and after Mint 's launch , the makers of Quicken Online ) for $ 170 million . A bit less than a year later , Wesabe shut down .
That 's the history ; now , some interpretation , with the completely obvious caveat that I am anything but an unbiased observer . I was the first person to start work on Wesabe and formally co-founded the company ( as Chief Product Officer ) with my high school friend , Jason Knight ( who was CEO ) . I made nearly all of the product decisions myself , and was notorious with Jason and our board as being very hard-headed about those decisions . While I relied on many other people in making product choices , I also hired and managed all of those people , so that group was at the least a reflection of who I thought had the right values and ideas . When Jason had to leave the company due to a family illness , I took over as CEO and led the company without a formal peer for the final two years . All that adds up to me having absolutely no one to blame for Wesabe 's failure but myself , and as a result I ca n't now nor could ever be dispassionate in thinking about what happened .
With that in mind , here are what I believe are a number of myths about why Mint won and Wesabe lost :
Mint launched first - I hear this surprisingly often ; they did n't . Wesabe launched about 10 months before Mint . More the shame that we did n't capitalize on that early lead . There 's a lot to be said for not rushing to market , and learning from the mistakes the first entrants make . Shipping a “ minimum viable product ” immediately and learning from the market directly makes good sense to me , but engaging with and supporting users is anything but free . Observation can be cheaper . Mint ( and some others ) did well by seeing where we screwed up , and waiting to launch until they had a better approach . Wesabe never made any money - untrue . We started generating revenue in late 2008 , a year and a half before we shut down ; and ran completely out of invested funds almost nine months before closing the company . ( Put another way : we survived solely on revenue from mid-November 2009 until the end of July of this year , when we turned off the site . ) Obviously we did n't make enough to keep us going indefinitely , but we were not far off from supporting a small company indefinitely on revenue . Mint was a better name and had a better design - both of these things are true , but I do n't believe they were primary causes for our company to fail and for Mint to be acquired . Mint 's CEO likes to talk about how ridiculous our name was relative to theirs , but I think the examples of Amazon , Yahoo , eBay , Google , and plenty of others make it plain that even ludicrous names ( as all of those were thought to be when the companies launched ) can go on to be great brands . Mint 's design , while definitely very appealing and definitely a factor in getting people to trust the company , does n't seem to me to be enough to explain the different outcomes , again based on what I 've seen from other companies ( del.icio.us versus Magnolia , eBay versus Amazon Auctions , and now iPhone slipping against Android ) . Design matters a huge amount , without question , and Mint 's design was exceptional , but if other , stronger forms of lock-in are in place first , design alone ca n't win a market , nor can it keep a market . Wesabe was n't viral and Mint was - half-true : neither product was . Neither of us bore any resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley success story , with traffic surging up and to the right ( YouTube , Twitter , etc ) . Mint aggressively acquired users by paying for search engine marketing ( reportedly spending over $ 1 for each user ) , while Wesabe spent almost nothing on marketing ; yet in the end we grew at about 1/5th the rate they did . Take a look at Mint 's Compete.com graph today and you 'll see that their traffic dropped substantially for the six months after their acquisition , and has had sawtooth traffic after that . That pattern matches with a decreased and then increased marketing budget , but not with viral growth . Our patterns similarly followed non-scalable curves ( influenced primarily by press wins , economic conditions , and sometimes drafting on Mint 's coverage ) .
Those are what I see as the common beliefs about the outcome of our competition with Mint that I do n't believe were right . Why was there such a difference , then ?
I see two primary reasons that , if they had changed before Mint 's launch or had never occurred in the first place , could well have allowed Wesabe to maintain its early lead and remain the leader against Mint 's entry .
First , we chose not to work with Yodlee , but failed to find or make a replacement for them ( until too late ) . Yodlee is a company that provides automatic financial data aggregation as a web service . They screen-scrape bank web sites ( that is , read the payee and amount and date by parsing them out of the bank 's web site , writing a custom parser for each bank they support ) . When we talked to Yodlee in 2006 , the company was crumbling , having failed to get acquired and losing executives . They were also very aggressive in negotiation , telling us they would give us six months ' service nearly free and then tell us the final price we 'd be charged going forward . Since they had effectively no competitors , we did n't believe we should tie our company to a single-source provider , especially one in very bad business shape . Mint used Yodlee ( at least until they were acquired - I 'm not sure what they 're doing now ) to automatically get user 's data from bank sites and import them into Mint , and as a result had a much easier user experience getting bank data imported . Wesabe built our own data acquisition system , first using downloadable client programs ( partially because that was easier and partially to preserve users ' privacy ) and later using a Yodlee-like web interface , but the Yodlee-like version did n't launch until six months after Mint went live , and even then did n't really work as a near-complete replacement for some time after .
A good friend argues that our mistake was not using Yodlee in the first place , and maybe – probably – it was . I believe , though , that we could have made that choice as long as we immediately assumed that someone else would eventually sign up with Yodlee , and that we had to be at least as good if not better than what Yodlee provided , however we got there . ( PageOnce , for instance , has not used Yodlee , but has grown very significantly in the same time , using a combination of other aggregation methods that were more effective than ours . ) Mint 's dependence on Yodlee apparently suppressed their acquisition interest among companies that knew Yodlee well ( such as Microsoft , Yahoo , and Google ) ; since we had developed our own technology for aggregation , we did n't have that particular problem , and in fact had some acquisition interest simply for the aggregator we 'd built . We just did n't build it nearly fast enough . That one mistake ( not using or replacing Yodlee before Mint had a chance to launch on Yodlee ) was probably enough to kill Wesabe alone .
Second , Mint focused on making the user do almost no work at all , by automatically editing and categorizing their data , reducing the number of fields in their signup form , and giving them immediate gratification as soon as they possibly could ; we completely sucked at all of that . Instead , I prioritized trying to build tools that would eventually help people change their financial behavior for the better , which I believed required people to more closely work with and understand their data . My goals may have been ( okay , were ) noble , but in the end we did n't help the people I wanted to since the product failed . I was focused on trying to make the usability of editing data as easy and functional as it could be ; Mint was focused on making it so you never had to do that at all . Their approach completely kicked our approach 's ass . ( To be defensive for just a moment , their data accuracy – how well they automatically edited – was really low , and anyone who looked deeply into their data at Mint , especially in the beginning , was shocked at how inaccurate it was . The point , though , is hardly anyone seems to have looked . )
Between the worse data aggregation method and the much higher amount of work Wesabe made you do , it was far easier to have a good experience on Mint , and that good experience came far more quickly . Everything I 've mentioned – not being dependent on a single source provider , preserving users ' privacy , helping users actually make positive change in their financial lives – all of those things are great , rational reasons to pursue what we pursued . But none of them matter if the product is harder to use , since most people simply wo n't care enough or get enough benefit from long-term features if a shorter-term alternative is available .
I am , of course , enormously sad that Wesabe lost and the company closed . I do n't agree with those who say you should learn from your successes and mostly ignore your failures ; nor do I agree with those who obsess over failures for years after ( as I have done in the past ) . I 'm hoping that by writing this all out I can offload it from my head and hopefully help inform other people who try to start companies in the future .
You 'll hear a lot about why company A won and company B lost in any market , and in my experience , a lot of the theories thrown about – even or especially by the participants – are utter crap . A domain name does n't win you a market ; launching second or fifth or tenth does n't lose you a market . You ca n't blame your competitors or your board or the lack of or excess of investment . Focus on what really matters : making users happy with your product as quickly as you can , and helping them as much as you can after that . If you do those better than anyone else out there you 'll win .
I think in this case , Mint totally won at the first ( making users happy quickly ) , and we both totally failed at the second ( actually helping people ) . No one , in my view , solved the financial problems of consumers . No one even got close . Yes , both products helped some people – ours mostly through a supportive community and theirs mostly through giving people a rough picture of where their money has gone . But when we analyzed the benefits we saw for our users , and when Mint boasted about the benefits they saw for their users , the debt reduction and savings increase numbers directly matched the national averages . Because our products existed during a deep financial crisis , consumers everywhere cut back , saved more , and tried to reduce their debt . Neither product had any significant impact beyond what the overall economy led people to do anyways .
So , yeah . Changing people 's behavior is really hard . No one in this market succeeded at doing so – there is no Google nor Amazon of personal finance . Can you succeed where we failed ? Please do – the problems are absolutely huge and the help consumers have is absolutely abysmal . Learn from the above and go help people ( after making them immediately happy , first ) .

An international team of scientists led by the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research ( AWI ) have managed to open a new window into the climate history of the Arctic Ocean . Using unique sediment samples from the Lomonosov Ridge , the researchers found that six to ten million years ago the central Arctic was completely ice-free during summer and sea-surface temperature reached values of 4 to 9 degrees Celsius . In spring , autumn and winter , however , the ocean was covered by sea ice of variable extent , the scientists explain in the current issue of the journal Nature Communications . These new findings from the Arctic region provide new benchmarks for groundtruthing global climate reconstructions and modelling .
The researchers had recovered these unique sediment samples during an expedition with Germany 's research icebreaker RV Polarstern in summer of 2014 . `` The Arctic sea ice is a very critical and sensitive component in the global climate system . It is therefore important to better understand the processes controlling present and past changes in sea ice . In this context , one of our expedition 's aims was to recover long sediment cores from the central Arctic , that can be used to reconstruct the history of the ocean 's sea ice cover throughout the past 50 million years . Until recently , only a very few cores representing such old sediments were available , and , thus , our knowledge of the Arctic climate and sea ice cover several millions of year ago is still very limited , '' Prof. Dr. Ruediger Stein , AWI geologist , expedition leader and lead author of the study , explains .
The scientists found an ideal place for recovering the sediment cores on the western slope of the Lomonosov Ridge , a large undersea mountain range in the central Arctic . `` This slope must have experienced gigantic recurring landslides in the past , which resulted in the exhumation of more than 500-metre thick ancient sediment and rock formations . We were also surprised about the wide-spread occurrence of these slide scars , which extend over a length of more than 300 kilometres , almost from the North Pole to the southern end of the ridge on the Siberian side , '' Ruediger Stein explains .
Sediment core emerges as a unique climate archive
Within a two-days coring action , they and their team took 18 sediment cores from this narrow area on Lomonosov Ridge on board the Polarstern research vessel . Although the recovered sediment cores were only four to eight metres long , one of them turned out to be precisely one of those climate archives that the scientists had been looking for a long time . `` With the help of certain microfossils , so-called dinoflagellates , we were able to unambiguously establish that the lower part of this core consists of approximately six to eight million-year-old sediments , thereby tracing its geological history back to the late Miocene . With the help of so-called 'climate indicators or proxies ' , this gave us the unique opportunity to reconstruct the climate conditions in the central Arctic Ocean for a time period for which only very vague and contradictory information was available , '' says Stein .
Some scientists were of the opinion that the central Arctic Ocean was already covered with dense sea ice all year round six to ten million years ago -- roughly to the same extent as today . The new research findings contradict this assumption . `` Our data clearly indicate that six to ten million years ago , the North Pole and the entire central Arctic Ocean must in fact have been ice-free in the summer , '' says Stein .
Biomarkers preserved in the sea floor allow insight into the climate 's past
This statement is based on studies of organic compounds ( so-called biomarkers ) that were produced by certain organisms that lived in the Arctic Ocean at that time and that have been preserved in the sediment deposits . The researchers were able to extract two of such marker groups from the sediments :
`` The first group of biomarkers is derived from carbonaceous algae that live in surface water , i.e . they need open water and , being plants , depend on light . Since in the central Arctic Ocean sunlight is only available during the spring and summer months and is pitch-dark at all other times , the data derived from these carbonaceous algae provide us with information about the surface water conditions during the summer period , '' says Stein .
Furthermore , these carbonaceous algae produce different biomarker compounds depending on the water temperature . `` These molecules allowed us to estimate that the surface water temperature of the Arctic Ocean was approximately 4 to 9 degrees Celsius in the late Miocene . Because these values are well above zero , this is a clear indication that ice-free conditions existed in the summer , '' says the scientist .
However , as the second group of biomarkers shows , the Arctic Ocean was not ice-free all year round . It is formed by specific diatoms that live in the Arctic sea ice . Ruediger Stein : `` By combining our data records on surface water temperature and on sea ice , we are now able to prove for the first time that six to ten million years ago , the central Arctic Ocean was ice-free in the summer . In the spring and the preceding winter , on the other hand , the ocean was covered by sea ice . The seasonal ice cover around the North Pole must have been similar to that in the Arctic marginal seas today . ''
New climate data help to improve climate models
These new findings of the Arctic Ocean climate history reconstructed from sediment data , are further corroborated by climate simulations , as was shown by the AWI modellers who participated in this study . This only applies , however , if we assume a relatively high carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere of 450 ppm . If the climate models were run using a significantly lower carbon dioxide content of about 280 ppm , as some studies postulate for the late Miocene , then an ice-free Arctic can not be simulated . Whether the carbon dioxide content in the Miocene was indeed relatively high or whether the sensitivity of the model is too weak to simulate the magnitude of high-latitude warming in a warmer than modern climate , is currently subject to further international research . One of the overarching goals here is to improve the predictive capacity of climate models . Ruediger Stein : `` Once our climate models are capable of reliably reproducing surface-water temperature and sea ice cover of earlier periods , we will also be able to further improve the climate models for a better prediction of future climate change and sea ice conditions in the central Arctic Ocean , a major challenge for all of us for the coming years . ''
Further scientific drilling planned on the Lomonosov Ridge
Despite the outstanding results and the accompanying euphoria , the participating scientists agree that this was merely the first step and that other important steps must follow . `` While our new sediment cores give us an undreamt-of initial insight into the early climate history of the Arctic , these climate records are still very incomplete . In order to fully unravel the great mystery of Arctic climate history over the past 20 to 60 million years , we need much longer , continuous sediment sequences , which can only be obtained by drilling . An Arctic drilling expedition ( which is still a major scientific and technical challenge for the marine geosciences ) is now planned for 2018 in our study area on the Lomonosov Ridge , and it will be carried out as part of the international drilling programme IODP ( International Ocean Discovery Program ) . The preliminary investigations carried out by our Polarstern expedition have played a significant role in selecting the precise drilling locations , '' Ruediger Stein , who will be one of the expedition leaders of the IODP campaign in 2018 , explains .

MoodTraces is a mobile phone application that periodically samples location , activity , application usage , and asnwers to questionnaires . The information collected in this way will be sent on a central server and will be analysed . We expect that the results of this analysis will identify patterns among the mobility traces , the mobile phone usage , and the emotional state of individuals , which can be used to develop technologies that can help the end user in their day-to-day life .
Collected information
This application will collect data from the phone 's sensors at periodic intervals , including : : 1 ) Current location ; 2 ) The activity that the user is performing among the following types of activities : in vehicle , on bicycle , on foot , running , walking , still , unknown ; 3 ) The list of the applications that are running on the phone ; 4 ) The number of characters and of words of the inbound and outbound SMS messages ; 5 ) The duration of the incoming and outgoing calls . The application will NOT collect the number or the identity of the callee/caller or the recipient/sender of the messages . The content of messages and calls is not collected either . This application will also collect the answers that the participant will provide to daily questionnaires . Each questionnaire consists of nine yes-no questions and one ot two 5-choice questions . The yes-no questions concern the occurrence of specific depressive symptoms in the current day ( e.g. , whether the participant had trouble falling or staying asleep , or sleeping too much , etc . ) ; these are the questions of the widely-used “ PHQ-8 ” depression test . The answers to these questions will be used to assess the presence of a depressed mood and how this varies in time . The multi-choice questions are personality questions ( e.g. , to what extent the participant see themselves as reserved , trusting , lazy , etc . ) ; these are the questions of the standard personality test “ Big Five Inventory ” . The answers to these questions across multiple days are used to classify user 's personality into one of the five broad factors of personality traits . Each questionnaire takes less than 1 minute to complete . Finally , the partipant has also the possibility to report its current mood ( e.g. , to what extent he/she feels happy in that moment ) whenever he/she wants . These reports will be used for visualization purposes .
How to participate
If you have a phone running Android OS , simply download the app from the Google App Store and install it . In order to start your participation you need to agree with our terms that will be clearly presented to you . In case you have any questions , do not hesitate to contact us . After you agree with the terms , fill out a registration form that asks , among other things , to select a password , which is needed in case you wish to access or delete the data collected from your phone . Once you installed the application , agreed with the terms and filled out the form , the application will run on your phone . The application will run quietly in the background and will not interfere with your daily mobile phone usage . Please , note that in order to participate to this experiment you must be older than 18 years old and you must be the sole prominent user of the mobile device in which the application will be installed . Unfortunately , due to a wide variety of phones we can not guarantee that the application will run flawlessly on your specific phone , but we welcome any feedback and will try to fix any application errors as soon as possible .
How to withdraw
If for any reason you want to withdraw from the experiment you can easily do so by uninstalling the application . Simply follow the instructions for uninstalling an Android application , and uninstall MoodTraces . No further data sensing will be performed . Until 1 September 2015 you have also the possibility to remove from the database all or any portion of your data . If you want to use this option , please email us with `` withdrawal '' in the subject line or talk to us in person during one of the application demo sessions . Data that are not removed from the database before 1 September 2015 will be preserved and accessible for ten years .
Benefits for the participant
Among all the participants that will download the application in their phone and will complete the daily questionnaire at least 50 times in a two months span , we will select ( through a lottery ) one winner of a Nexus 5 mobile phone and five winners that will receive a 10£ Amazon voucher each . Moreover , we hope that you will find the application useful , as it will allow you to visualize your mobility traces , and the activities you performed and the emotional states you experienced in different locations and at different times . Finally , we will send you a summary of the results of the study .
How much of a burden is MoodTraces ?
We try to minimize the impact of the application on the user 's life and phone . The application will be energy-efficient and will run in the background without hindering or effecting the user 's day-to-day tasks , unless the user deliberately brings it to the front in order to view the front-end of the application , which allows the user to visualize , through an interactive map , part of the collected data . The application will perform occasional uploads and downloads , however the application will be developed in such a way that it will always prefer using Wi-Fi to transfer the information . Cellular data connection , which may cause the user to incur mobile data plan charges , will only be used if there has not been an upload for a long interval of time . However , the amount of data transferred will be minimal : less than 1MB per day . In case that a user finds the application too burdensome , he/she can simply uninstall it . Once the research is complete we will notify the user about it , such that the user can uninstall the application from the device and , consequently , stop the data collection process .
How secure and private is MoodTraces ?
The mobile phone application data collection and on-the-phone storage is designed in accordance to the state-of-the-art best practices in application development . This data will be inaccessible by any other ( malicious ) application installed on the same phone . To assure that the data is unreadable to any third party in case that a phone is lost/stolen , the application will encrypt all the data that will be stored on the phone 's memory card . Personal information such as contacts ( telephone numbers , email addresses , etc . ) and the contents of the conversations and of the SMS messages will not be collected by the application . The collected information will be transferred to the server using secure transmission . The server itself is at a secure location in the Computer Science building of the University of Birmingham . Login to the server is only available to researchers involved in the MoodTraces experiment and members of Networked Systems and Data Science Lab , for research purposes only .
I 'm an Android developer , can I get the application source code ?
This application is primarily used as a research tool , and we do not plan to release it on Google Play or support it as an open source project . However , you might be interested in open source libraries for smartphone sensing , sensor data management and notification triggering . Such libraries have been developed by Neal Lathia and Kiran Rachuri , University of Cambridge and are available here .

Jens Voigt is set to retire as we speak , having one final crack at a long break in some race in the Cycling backwater of the USA . Is it fair or fitting that they should go out like this , slipping out the back door with little fanfare , while others have been doing a farewell tour of all the big races , replete with fancy commemorative shoes and a song and dance ? It 's probably apt that Jens is just doing what he 's always done : getting on with the job at hand and not saying too much . It 's almost like he 's been given the Golden Handshake , received their gold watch ( well , another Trek ) , and gently herded out of the room , along with the elephant .
There 's no doubt that Jens is a hero to almost the entire cycling world ; fans and contemporaries alike instantly warm to the big guy . He 's probably a great bloke to get on the beers with , keeping everyone entertained with their goofy German sense of humour ( an oxymoron , I know ) and regaling their enthralled audience with stories of that time they towed the peloton up the Galibier , dropping pure climbers like flies one by one . And because he 's a big , goofy , lovable German , no-one would even consider questioning their morals or ethics when it comes to their role in the sport , and their considerable time in it . He 's Jens , he 's a bloody legend .
There 's always double standards applied when it comes to our Cycling heroes . Pantani : revered , matyred . Gunderson : condemned . Contador : forgiven , re-accepted . Valverde : despised . O'Grady , Rogers : well , they 're Australian , so even though they admitted/tested positive , no Aussie would ever cheat , right ? They 're just lovable larrikins who got caught in the crossfire , and were unlucky or only “ did it once ” . Sir , your pig is fuelled and ready for take-off .
I 've loved watching Jens going on crazy long breaks , laughed at the many soundbites he 's provided us , and they were even convinced to mouth our catchcry , although they probably had no clue as to what they were being cajoled into . They always have time for their fans , and that 's a sign of a true champion of the people . Imagine if Gunderson was a bit more humourous , if he 'd cracked a few jokes instead of cracking skulls , if he 'd told some part of their body to ‘ shut up ' instead of telling other riders to do the same . Maybe he 'd still be squeaky clean in the eyes of the fans , just like Jens .
While I respect a man who has ridden at the front of the peloton for 20 years and well into their 40s , and take inspiration from that , I ca n't just sit here and digest every stock-standard quote that is rolled out . Jens came from one of the world 's most notorious doping programs in the East German system , but somehow was n't earmarked for the treatment . They rode professionally from 1997 , the height of the EPO era , through Festina , through the Gunderson years , through the Landis/Rasmussen/Contador years . Yet they saw nothing . They rode on teams with more than a sprinkling of convicted and/or known dopers , yet they heard nothing . They rode under Directors Sportif who oversaw some of the biggest doping programs ever witnessed , yet they witnessed nothing himself . They continued to race at the same high level , and above , as the world 's best racers , well past the age when they threw in the towel , yet they want us to believe he 's done it all on mineral water and sauerkraut .
While I love the guy , I 'm not stupid , and neither are the cycling public . We do n't need to be treated like fools by every rider that ever rode in the Pro ranks , but we are , still . Even Gunderson has admitted he 'd still be lying to us all , their family , children and cancer community if they had n't been outed . That 's the mentality of the Omérta in action . Jens is as old school as they come , and unfortunately he 's taking that mindset with them into retirement .
I wish Jens all the best , but I also wish he 'd shown the same hardman qualities off the bike as they did on it , and spoken out about what they did actually see , hear and do . That would make them even more a legend .

About 200 families return to Artsakh for their holidays .
Following the Karabakh War , thousands of Armenians fled the country , most for Russia . The 1994 Russian-brokered ceasefire brought a tenuous peace to the region , yet for the multitudes that left , return has not been desirable or possible .
The Artsakh Compatriot Union ( ACU ) this year planned a sort of homecoming for some of those who had left .
According to Artsakh Press , almost 200 families arrived in Karabakh on June 20 , heeding the call of the ACU for Armenian families , especially those whose roots are in Karabakh , to spend their summer holidays in Artsakh .
Greeting them at the border of Armenia-Artsakh was Prime Minister of Nagorno Karabakh Ara Harutyunyan and representatives of a number of youth organizations , who had prepared large signs and offered the traditional bread and salt for the homecoming .
Prime Minister Harutyunyan expressed their gratitude to the Artsakh Compatriot Union and its President Varujan Grigoryan , for organizing the trip . They said that this initiative was significant not only for those living in Artsakh but for all those who had left . “ This is an opportunity , first of all , for each Armenian of Artsakh to come once a year to Artsakh and live with their compatriots , ” Harutyunyan said . “ Allow your children and grandchildren to connect with their fatherland so that they do n't lose their identity and by doing so , you will greatly contribute to the flourishing of Artsakh . ”
The President of the Artsakh Compatriot Union , Varujan Grigoryan said , “ I am very happy and excited that so many people heeded our call , ” and added that this will not be a one time project . “ This is a very big patriotic step and I think that every Armenian should spend at least a week of their holidays on their native soil. ” According to Grigoryan , this initiative has four purposes - patriotism , economic growth , resettlement/repatriation and ensuring security .
One of the participants of the trip is Karine Danielyan , originally from the village of Chapar in the region of Martakert . Danielyan , who has been living in Rostov , Russia for the past 24 years said , “ Every year we spend one month in our fatherland ; it soothes our hearts and helps ease the longing for our native soil .

Please do not ask if `` model x '' is supported ... did you unlock via LG 's official unlock tool ? Yes ? then you can use the zip . No ? .. then you should skip the zips and just flash the KDZ instead .
If you have a locked bootloader and want to upgrade ... just use LGUP and flash the KDZ . Do n't risk it with FlashFire .
Install Directions :
These directions should be used by everyone who wants a rooted 20D system .
Do n't want root ? Then it 's probably easiest to just flash the stock KDZ using LGUP HERE ... or just skip the SuperSu steps .
1 . Download LG-H81520D-Flashable.COMPLETE.zip listed under the download section and place it on internal or external sdcard .
2 . Also download the latest SuperSu zip ( 2.67+ ) from HERE [ Thanks to Chainfire for their auto-patching boot.img version ! ]
3 . ( re ) Boot into TWRP if not there already .
4 . * Backup current partitions : boot , system , data , efs ( backing up anything is optional but suggested )
5 . * Up to you if you want to wipe data ( TWRP > Wipe > Swipe slider ) but not needed if coming from a stock rom .
6 . Install LG-H81520D-Flashable.COMPLETE.zip ( Install > select zip > swipe to confirm/flash )
7 . Install SuperSu zip ( Install > select zip > swipe to confirm/flash )

7 Inspiring examples of doodles , comments and notes while solving Sudoku
A doodle is an unfocused drawing or sketch made while a person 's attention is otherwise occupied ( Wikipedia ) . Some doodles have meaning or a recognizable shape while others are abstract . Anyone who ever solved logic puzzles on a piece of paper has made at least one doodle so puzzle fans make the most fabulous doodlers as they generate countless numbers of those little sub-conscious masterpieces .
New to this website ? If you enjoy playing brain games online , do n't forget to check our huge selection of free puzzles .
Seeing that puzzle doodles as well as comments , notes and records scribbled while solving puzzles can make a great gallery , we would like to invite everyone to share your own artistic creations right here at conceptispuzzles.com . With avid puzzlers who have been around for a while we are sure many of you have packs of crushed , butchered and wiped out records of solved or partially solved puzzles around their house .
Please do n't let your personal logic flavor be in the way , so if you have picture logic or number logic doodle masterpieces please email them to us and we may publish them here . To inspire your imagination we selected a few neat examples from enthusiastic Sudoko solvers who have already uploaded their photos to the Internet . Enjoy !
Sudoku doodling at work
When not doodling at work , Sudoku keeps Dave Sykes from the USA awake , interested and sane . Cheers for a 30 something married guy who manages to keep their job while still uploading their doodles to Flickr for us .
The process is simple and well described by Sykes : Work ... bored ... Sudoku ... sketch ... the margins provide space to doodle when the numbers make my brain hurt . Maybe Sudoku is the only thing keeping me sane at work , between calls . Sudoku and the margin doodling . ''
See more creative puzzle doodles by Sykes here .
Beautiful Killer Sudoku records
This professional-looking snapshot of a Killer Sudoku record sheet was taken in February 2009 by a number logic fan named Alasdair Nicol from Berlin , Germany . `` You ca n't beat the Guardian puzzle page on a Saturday ; Sudoku , Killer Sudoku and Futoshiki all on one page '' says Alasdair . `` After messing up the grid in the newspaper , I had to copy it by hand for a second attempt '' . The result is shown above . For more photos by Alasdair see al.sdair.co.uk
Extreme Sudoku records
This one , by Michelle Fu Brian McBay from Vancouver , is titled Remnants of an avid Sudoku player . `` Avid '' is a bit of an understatement here , do n't you think ?
Never too young for a Sudoku records
Aaron Wormus was walking through the bookstore with their 5 year old daughter when the young lady asked for their own Sudoku book and got one , suitable for kids . About 10 minutes after Annie understood the simple rules of Sudoku they came back with their first solved one . `` Pretty impressive for a 5-year-old '' says Wormus . We very much agree .
Morbid Sudoku doodle records
Amanda , a creative puzzle fan from Mt . Vernon also known as pinprick on Flickr drew the above doodles on the back of a `` butchered '' Sudoku puzzle .
Agony Sudoku records
Part of Robert Bryn 's spiritual practice / self-improvement regimen in L.A. is sitting by the pool and working on Sudoku . The above doodle was made on an airplane during one of Bryn 's flights . `` I was having such a hard time with the puzzle that I made a mess of it in the airline magazine '' says Bryn . `` I copied it into my graph paper notebook and made a little drawing while I was agonizing over it . Some Sudoku puzzles are just a little bit too hard , are n't they ?
Consolation Sudoku records
And while we are on the subject of agony puzzles here is another guy nicknamed Cheego who was travelling in bad conditions , tired and worried . `` It was too difficult to even think to use the Moleskine for drawings , poems , or intelligent things '' says Cheego so the only remaining option was coming up with their own doodled Sudoku . We are not sure what exactly Cheego means by `` intelligent things '' ( perhaps Pic-a-Pix ? ) but if you are wondering what a Moleskine might be : it 's a very stylish brand of notebook manufactured by an Italian company that holds the same name .

New reasons for hope in Afghanistan
The outcome of the Afghanistan conflict is still up for grabs .
But after meetings there with NATO officers , Afghan officials and U.S. Embassy officials on a recent trip , I saw more basis for hope than recent perceptions in the United States would allow .
Story Continued Below
There was at least some positive news on the election . Four million in turnout is not bad for a midterm election in a troubled , war-torn country .
To be sure , there was a fair amount of violence during the Sept. 18 parliamentary elections . Turnout was mediocre overall , even poor in places . But as I saw there with the International Republican Institute 's election observation — IRI was ecumenical enough to include a Democrat like me — these problems were at least partly balanced by the remarkable resolve of many Afghans , including election workers and security forces .
Insurgents had months to prepare for attacks on Election Day . While any loss of life is regrettable , the 20 to 25 deaths that day were far fewer than anticipated . Yes , there were irregularities , as the U.S. media have been reporting . But these stories often lack perspective on realistic expectations for a young democracy . Moreover , Afghan agencies have already been charged with investigating the election — a hopeful sign .
Major challenges remain in Afghanistan that , if not addressed , may still cause the U.S. to fail there . It is far too early to give up on the current strategy and fall back on a Plan B . But it is not too soon to consider some dramatic new efforts — starting with a bold proposal to Pakistan .
First , though , here 's a review of the situation as it looked to me over my 10-day trip .
The problems in Afghanistan are legion and serious — and well-known . But a few points merit emphasis . The estimated size of the insurgency , particularly the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani networks , continues to grow . Despite a major increase in lethal attacks by U.S. Special Forces and other coalition assets , the resistance remains resilient .
Violence in Afghanistan has grown even faster than the uptick in coalition forces , suggesting that it is not just our increased tempo of operations that drives the fighting . Though the number of roadside bomb attacks has stabilized relative to last year ( and declined in the east ) , we are still losing too many coalition and Afghan troops and police to these horrible weapons . And direct-fire attacks from small-arms fire are way up .
Needless to say , failures to address corruption — much of it in President Hamid Karzai 's inner circle , some of it a result of traditional Afghan social customs , lots of it exacerbated by the U.S. way of doing business there — create a sense of anger and disenfranchisement among many Afghan citizens .
This should be no surprise . History shows that strong presidencies in weak states that benefit from easy sources of cash ( in this case , foreign aid and the foreign military presence ) are prone to corruption problems . But these are no less serious because they are expected .
Seven days into Trump 's presidency , and the response from many of us has been anger and alarm . Fortunately , there were also those who could see the funny side – here is a pick of the best

And because dogs make everything better :
Two men are suspected of scrawling racist graffiti across a Northeast Portland elementary school and committing other vile acts of vandalism on its grounds , according to police and multiple reports .
Administrators at Menlo Park Elementary School told KOIN News that a custodian discovered the hateful messages painted on its property Thursday morning and scrambled to cover them up before children arrived .
The suspected vandals also threw eggs at the building and burned a portable toilet near the school 's soccer field to the ground , said Principal Kellie Burkhardt .
`` It makes me sad that adults would model this kind of behavior in our community to our children , '' Burkhardt told KOIN News .
Burkhardt did not immediately respond to phone calls and emails left by The Oregonian/OregonLive .
Surveillance video reviewed by the Portland Police Bureau shows two men believed to be in their 20s or 30s at the school around 1:10 a.m. on Thursday , said Sgt . Chris Burley , a police spokesperson . Bias crime detectives have been notified of the incident , Burley said .
KPTV reported that Menlo Park , which is located on Northeast Glisan Street and 129th Avenue , is a multi-cultural school where students speak 24 languages .

White : - $ 2,795
Black : + $ 10,016
Hispanic : +7,298
If you are a white American , over the course of your lifetime the federal government will , on average and on your behalf , transfer $ 384,109 of your wealth and income to a single black individual.According to the data derived from the 2014 federal budget , the average annual net tax/benefit broke down as follows : Over the course of an average 79-year lifespan , a white individual contributes a net $ 220,805 to the system , whereas over the course of an average 75-year lifespan , a black individual receives a net $ 751,200 . However , since there are 4.6 times more whites than blacks in the USA , the black share has to be divided among the various contributors to sort out a one-to-one comparison.So , the net cost to the average White American of the average Black American is $ 384,109 . Married ? That 's $ 768,218 . Got 2 kids ? That 's $ 1,536,436 . 4 kids ? Now we 're talking $ 2,304,654 lifetime.Diversity is . Now you understand why you wo n't have much of an inheritance to leave to your children . Do you really think it 's worth it ? And then , those natural conservatives to the south , the Hispanics , will surely improve the situation , right ? After all , immigration helps the economy ! Well , not so much.In fact , because there are more Hispanics in the USA than Blacks , Hispanics are already a bigger cumulative net drain on the economy , $ 411,950,000,000 to $ 389,710,000,000 . Needless to say , the ongoing demographic change from a predominantly white society to a less productive , less white one can be expected to have even more serious negative effects on the long-term economic prospects of the United States that it already has.To quote the original author :
Labels : economics , Vibrancy is our strength
Many will ask whether Mr. Obama can actually pull off the deficit reduction they promise . Can they actually reduce the red ink from $ 1.75 trillion this year to less than a third as much in 2013 ? Yes , they can .
Right now the deficit is huge thanks to temporary factors ( at least we hope they 're temporary ) : a severe economic slump is depressing revenues and large sums have to be allocated both to fiscal stimulus and to financial rescues .

But if and when the crisis passes , the budget picture should improve dramatically . Bear in mind that from 2005 to 2007 , that is , in the three years before the crisis , the federal deficit averaged only $ 243 billion a year . Now , during those years , revenues were inflated , to some degree , by the housing bubble . But it 's also true that we were spending more than $ 100 billion a year in Iraq .
So if Mr. Obama gets us out of Iraq ( without bogging us down in an equally expensive Afghan quagmire ) and manages to engineer a solid economic recovery — two big ifs , to be sure — getting the deficit down to around $ 500 billion by 2013 should n't be at all difficult .
But wo n't the deficit be swollen by interest on the debt run-up over the next few years ? Not as much as you might think . Interest rates on long-term government debt are less than 4 percent , so even a trillion dollars of additional debt adds less than $ 40 billion a year to future deficits . And those interest costs are fully reflected in the budget documents .

So we have good priorities and plausible projections . What 's not to like about this budget ? Basically , the long run outlook remains worrying .
According to the Obama administration 's budget projections , the ratio of federal debt to G.D.P . , a widely used measure of the government 's financial position , will soar over the next few years , then more or less stabilize . But this stability will be achieved at a debt-to-G.D.P . ratio of around 60 percent . That would n't be an extremely high debt level by international standards , but it would be the deepest in debt America has been since the years immediately following World War II . And it would leave us with considerably reduced room for maneuver if another crisis comes along .
Furthermore , the Obama budget only tells us about the next 10 years . That 's an improvement on Bush-era budgets , which looked only 5 years ahead . But America 's really big fiscal problems lurk over that budget horizon : sooner or later we 're going to have to come to grips with the forces driving up long-run spending — above all , the ever-rising cost of health care .
And even if fundamental health care reform brings costs under control , I at least find it hard to see how the federal government can meet its long-term obligations without some tax increases on the middle class . Whatever politicians may say now , there 's probably a value-added tax in our future .

But I do n't blame Mr. Obama for leaving some big questions unanswered in this budget . There 's only so much long-run thinking the political system can handle in the midst of a severe crisis ; they have probably taken on all they can , for now . And this budget looks very , very good .

While many Orthodox Jewish men dress in black , the mask , cape and Batman costume Josh Aryeh wears is a little less typical . This is the getup they every week in order to give solace and entertainment to children with cancer and other chronic illnesses . “ Ever since I was a kid I loved giving back , ” explains Aryeh , a Long Island entrepreneur . “ A few years ago I realized I had a lot of access to high-end cars… I thought to team up with Chai Lifelike , Kids of Courage- why not team up to see what we can do ? ” Since then , Aryeh has visited over 1300 children , giving them gifts , rides in sports cars to pizza , ice cream or bowling or just visiting them in the hospital to cheer them up . Growing up as a religious Jew , chesed was always prioritized in Aryeh 's home and school , so thinking of those less fortunate than them is second nature .
Aryeh soon discovered how deep the impact of their efforts was . “ There was an eight-year-old girl who made a wish to go for a ride in a convertible Lamborghini . They had cancer since the age of 4 – half their life . But they were so happy . They got in the car , top down music on . I remember getting back to the house and they wheeled them back in . Them mother starts hysterically crying . [ Finally they said ] ‘ You do n't understand…Its the first time I 've seen my daughter smile since they were diagnosed . ' ” Aryeh was forever changed . “ That 's when you 're supposed to be innocent . That 's unfathomable . It was something so simple but meant so much. ” Aryeh then got the idea to incorporate the theme of Batman and the Batmobile . They had a Nissan GTR transformed into the Batmobile with the help of a customization shop and started bringing it to hospitals and treatment centers . The effect was immediate .
Since then , Aryeh , whose day job is as owner of the company Fruits in Chocolate , has made their hobby into an inspiration to others . Wealthy individuals who participated in exotic car clubs heard what Aryeh was doing and messaged him , offering them their cars to take to hospitals . “ Kids make a wish to go for a ride in a Ferrari , Bentley , Rolls-Royce…sometimes I bring the owners with me . It 's pretty amazing. ” Fans of their work told Aryeh that they should publicize the good they were doing . So they started the Instagram page “ Real Batman Account , ” so their rides of chesed can be shared . They have since founded the charity Heroic Helpers .
“ They get to forget what they are going through , feel normal and feel like a kid . They do n't just have the flu for a week or a month . They have intense pain and treatment for years . Those few hours we get to give them something else to think about. ” When Aryeh started bringing presents to the children , certain stores found out and now wo n't let them pay for the goods , insisting on giving it to them for free . Friends of Aryeh 's now join them regularly , dressed as other superheroes and Disney Princesses . “ A lot of these kids truly believe that I 'm batman . I brought Robin and Batgirl with me once and a kid said , ” Where 's the rest of the Justice League ? Oh if you 're all in here , they have to be out there making the world safe . ”
Aryeh is excited to meet David Mazouz , who plays young Bruce Wayne on the show Gotham , at the 5th Annual Orthodox Jewish All Stars Gala this Sunday night in Manhattan . “ Its very cool because I know the kids always talk about this show. ” Aryeh is often able to bring their vocation and their passion together by creating custom chocolates with Batman logos . “ I bring that with me when I go to the kids . It gives them another reason to smile . ”
To meet Josh Aryeh and David Mazouz , buy your tickets to the 5th Annual Orthodox Jewish All Stars Awards Show and Premiere Party here !

HRL Laboratories , LLC , has received an award as part of NASA 's Space Technology Research , Development , Demonstration , and Infusion program to develop additive manufactured ( 3D-printed ) ceramic rocket engine components .
HRL achieved a scientific breakthrough with preceramic resins that can be 3D printed and converted to high-temperature ceramic that was first published in the journal Science on January 1 , 2016 .
With NASA support , HRL researchers will further develop this new technology to additively manufacture reinforced ceramic rocket propulsion components . The HRL technique combines the ease , flexibility , and low cost of polymer additive manufacturing with the high-temperature capabilities of ceramics . This will enable new designs , lower costs and reduced lead time .
`` High-temperature ceramics are notoriously difficult to process with conventional methods , '' said Tobias Schaedler , the project 's program manager . `` 3D printing could completely change what ceramic parts look like and where they are applied in rocket engines . ''
HRL will subcontract with Vector , a micro satellite launch company that will investigate innovative rocket engine designs and assess performance improvements to its line of launch vehicles enabled by additive manufacturing . The two-year program will culminate with hot-fire ground testing of rocket engines that contain 3D-printed heat-resistant components at Vector 's facility .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China aims to keep energy consumption within 5 billion tonnes of standard coal equivalent by 2020 , it said in its five-year plan published on Saturday , marking the first time the world 's second-biggest economy has set such a target .

China has long been considering an energy consumption cap in a bid to improve industrial efficiency , tackle smog and control greenhouse gas emissions , which are the highest in the world . Beijing is also pushing structural reforms to decouple economic growth from energy consumption .
“ Energy consumption will be less than 5 billion tonnes if China 's structural adjustment goes smoothly , ” said Xi Fengming , an expert on carbon emissions at the China Academy of Sciences , adding that the planned launch of a nationwide carbon emissions market next year would make it easier to achieve .
However , with energy demand growth already slowing considerably and China overshooting its 2011-2015 energy efficiency targets , there might have been room to lower the number further , researchers said .
Yang Fuqiang , senior advisor at the U.S.-based think tank , the Natural Resources Defense Council , said the 5 billion figures was calculated by combining China 's 6.5 percent economic growth projections for 2016-2020 with its target to cut energy intensity by 15 percent over the same period .
“ Based on my experience the government plans are conservative , ” they said . “ There could be a higher 18 percent cut in energy intensity , and that means energy consumption could be kept at about 4.8 billion tonnes . ”
The China Energy Research Society ( CERS ) , a think tank , said in a report published last week that it expected energy consumption to reach 4.8 billion tonnes of standard coal by 2020 and rise to 5.3 billion tonnes by the end of 2030 .
“ We should see this ( 5 billion tonne ) target as a ceiling rather than a floor , ” said Zhou Dadi , an energy policy researcher at CERS . “ Maybe we can achieve better results . ”
Total energy consumption was 4.3 billion tonnes of standard coal in 2015 , up 0.9 percent from the previous year , according to the most recent data from the National Bureau of Statistics .
The average annual growth rate was 2.3 percent over 2012-2015 , down from 6.4 percent in 2005-2012 , the bureau said .
With China determined to curb pollution and emissions , experts expressed disappointment at the failure to include a coal consumption cap .
Coal consumption in China fell 2.2 percent last year as a result of stricter pollution controls as well as a downturn in demand .
In a separate report published ahead of the opening of the full session of parliament on Saturday , the National Development and Reform Commission promised to limit growth of coal production and coal-fired power generation this year .
China is aiming to eliminate as much as 500 million tonnes of surplus coal capacity from the market in the next five years .
China also aims to cut carbon intensity - the amount of emissions per unit of GDP growth - by 18 percent over the same period . As part of its global climate change commitments , China has already pledged to reduce carbon intensity to 40-45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 .

Oakland cop faces probe over comments OAKLAND Union leader faces internal affairs investigation , their attorney alleges
An Oakland police officer who criticized the department 's leadership in a Chronicle article was told their comments are the basis for an internal affair investigation against him , their attorney said Friday .
Officer Barry Donelan , the head of the Oakland Police Officers ' Association , was quoted in a Nov. 19 article about a legal brief filed by the union 's attorneys . The brief attacked the department 's handling of internal affairs investigations and characterized the inquiries as `` dishonest . ''
Donelan 's attorney , Michael Rains , said their client was notified one day after the article appeared that investigators wanted to discuss their knowledge of any allegedly dishonest investigations , even though Donelan 's quote in the article did not directly refer to that allegation .
Rains said the query was a form of harassment and that Donelan was targeted for their broader remarks that faulted the department 's top brass for a lack of leadership .
An investigation , Rains said , could serve as a way to probe Donelan 's relationship with news reporters and could force their client into a difficult position .
`` Once he 's in there , he 's got to talk or clam up , '' Rains said . `` And if they clam up , then they can move to fire them for insubordination . ''
A spokesperson for Police Chief Howard Jordan did not respond to messages for comment on Friday . Officials typically do not comment on personnel matters .
In the article , Donelan discussed the union 's legal brief , which harshly criticized police leaders for failing to implement 51 department-wide reforms required in a 2003 civil settlement . That settlement stemmed from a criminal case known as `` The Riders , '' where four police officers were accused of beating and framing suspects in East Oakland . Attorneys representing the alleged victims of the Riders filed a civil lawsuit , which led to the settlement and its reforms .
Too many probes ?
The union 's brief , in part , alleges that department leaders had pursued an excessive amount of internal affairs investigations that resulted in faulty conclusions in an attempt to appease a federal judge overseeing the reforms .
`` They 're being unnecessarily punitive and heavy-handed , '' Rains said . `` The thinking is that as long as the judge sees police officers ' heads rolling , they 're doing a good job managing the department . ''
The union 's stance in the brief appears to side with the plaintiffs ' attorneys in the Riders case , who asked the judge to turn the department over to a federal receiver .
`` The common denominator between us and the plaintiffs ' attorneys is that we 're both looking for leadership from the city and we 're not finding it , '' Donelan said in the Nov. 19 article . `` We never made the argument we want a federal receiver - that 's up to the learned judge to make the call - but we were honest . Our responsibility is to the members and the citizens . ''
The internal affairs investigation into Donelan comes at a sensitive time in the department 's quest to stave off the receivership , which the federal judge will consider when they hear oral arguments Dec. 13 .
Oakland police officers are prohibited from talking about the settlement , and can face contempt of court charges if they criticize the reforms or the terms of the agreement .
After civil rights attorneys filed their motion urging a federal takeover , police officials issued another decree to the rank and file that reminded officers they were not allowed to discuss the matter with reporters .
The possible questioning of Donelan could set up a First Amendment quandary down the road , said Jesse Choper , a UC Berkeley law professor who has written about public employees who faced sanctions for making public comments .
As public employees , police officers are limited in what they can comment on , including personnel matters and working conditions . But , Choper said , they are allowed to discuss issues of `` public concern . ''
`` The fact that they are commenting on a matter that is public concern - the lawsuit - and not simply on their own , will tend to be something that favors protection under the First Amendment , '' Choper said .
`` What they have to overcome is the fact that they are making a comment on employment conditions , which is a matter of internal office affairs , '' Choper added . `` That , by itself , cuts against their claim that he 's protected by the First Amendment . ''
Examining comments
Under departmental guidelines posted on a website , if police officials believed Donelan 's comments indicated they had knowledge of an improper internal affairs investigation , an investigation is required .
Rains said they were drafting a letter to Jordan to halt the investigation before their client is interviewed .
Ing-wen Tsai , who leads the presidential polls , envisions a ‘ nuclear-free homeland ' with a bigger role for energy efficiency and renewables
By Megan Darby
Taiwan is facing a phase-out of atomic power , with nuclear sceptic Ing-wen Tsai tipped to win a presidential election on Saturday .
The island state 's three operating nuclear plants are due for retirement by 2023 . A fourth , 90 % built , was mothballed last year in response to protests from a public spooked by Japan 's Fukushima disaster .
Opinion polls predict a landslide victory for Tsai , with their Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) in with a chance of its first ever parliamentary majority .
Them vision of a “ nuclear-free homeland ” has been dismissed as “ unrealistic ” by the incumbent Kuomintang ( KMT ) party .
The exclusion of a major source of low carbon electricity , which accounts for 19 % of supply , raises tough questions about Taiwan 's climate goals .
Kwang-yin Liu , reporter for Taiwan 's CommonWealth Magazine , told Climate Home by email : “ No matter which party takes office – KMT or DPP – the challenges will be the same : with the policy of decommissioning the old nuclear reactors in place , Taiwan will need to increase its budget dramatically in developing renewable energy sources in order to cut emissions .
“ However , [ with ] an absence of both the political will to raise the electricity price and a clear roadmap to investing in renewables , these goals are almost impossible to achieve . ”
Taiwan is responsible for an estimated 0.55 % of global greenhouse gas emissions . Yet it is excluded from UN forums , including the climate body . Beijing insists the breakaway province , functionally independent since the end of World War II , will eventually be reintegrated with mainland China .
Despite its diplomatic isolation , the government in Taipei has set emissions targets : a 20 % cut from 2005 levels by 2030 and a halving by 2050 .
The climate agenda had a lower profile in this election campaign than the last in 2012 , said Chia-Wei Chao from the Green Citizen Action Alliance .
Tsai 's DPP committed to support renewables and energy efficiency , but did n't refer to the long-term goal . Nor have an energy tax or climate adaptation strategy been much discussed this time round .
Setting out their green energy platform in September , Tsai predicted NT $ 1 trillion ( US $ 30 billion ) of investment in the renewables sector .
“ The time is ripe for Taiwan 's green energy development — what we lack is a government determined to see it through , ” they said in remarks reported by the China Post .
Tze-Luen Lin , energy and climate expert at National Taiwan University , expressed confidence the emissions targets were attainable .
“ Some people argue that we need nuclear to meet that challenge , but I think there is still some room for energy efficiency , ” they told Climate Home .
The shallow Taiwan Strait offers scope for large scale offshore wind farms , but such projects have been slow to take off .
“ It is very possible for government to speed up investment and create a better environment for business , ” said Lin .
The biggest challenge will be transforming the manufacturing-led economy , in Lin 's view : curbing the carbon footprints of heavy industries like steel .

Kiev , Ukraine—The European Council on Foreign Relations ( ECFR ) released an assessment of possible scenarios for Russia 's collapse last week .
The report , written by visiting fellow Nikolay Petrov , concludes that the Russian political system `` has no capacity to reform , and faces growing economic woes , crumbling infrastructure , and warring elites . ''
A combination of falling oil prices and sanctions enacted against Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine have had increasingly negative effects on the Russian economy , raising questions about the sustainability of Russian leader Vladimir Putin 's regime .
Petrov identified three possible outcomes for Russia . The first is some manner of `` regime change , '' where the current Russian political system collapses under stress from sanctions and low oil prices .
The other outcomes Petrov described as `` Exit Strategies , '' where the Russian political system avoids collapse . A safe exit could be achieved if oil prices increase in the near term or if Russia chooses to engage constructively with the West . The other exit strategy would involve replacing Putin and restoring the government 's legitimacy in the eyes of the Russian people and international community .
Russian affairs analysts familiar with the report expressed skepticism about the exit strategies , which offer hope that Putin 's rule can be drawn to a peaceful conclusion . Oil prices are not projected to rise to levels that would revive Russia 's economy , and a return to a normal relationship with the West is also unlikely . While some European figures , notably German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier , have called for diplomacy with Moscow , the success of negotiations is far from assured .
There are also signs that Putin is moving to strengthen their grip on power . Earlier this month , the Kremlin announced the creation of a 400,000-strong national guard , which one analyst in Moscow referred to as `` a modern-day Russian version of the Waffen-SS . '' The army will consist of combat units from the Ministry of the Interior plus special forces and personnel from other security agencies . The army is now being moved under Putin 's personal command .
The new military formation will be commanded by Putin 's former bodyguard , Viktor Zolotov , who has been a part of Putin 's inner circle since the 1990s .
By transferring the ministry 's sizeable military assets to Putin , the `` unnecessary link—that of the [ Interior ] minister—between the commander-in-chief and the head of the National Guard is removed , '' wrote Tatiana Stanovaya , director of the analytical department of the Center of Political Technologies in Moscow .
The new army indicates Putin may be `` fortifying their administration against the threat of a coup , '' according to analysis from the U.S. think tank Stratfor . `` This may suggest that the Russian president doubts whether other security forces , the FSB , Interior Ministry troops or even the military would remain loyal to them in the event of a coup . ''
Petrov concludes that democratic reform is unlikely inside Russia in the near-term given the dismantling of civil society under Putin and the nature of the country 's ruling elites .
`` A year from now , the country will look different in many ways , which poses many questions both in the sphere of domestic politics and that of foreign policy , '' Petrov wrote . `` But , as the old saying goes , Russia is a country where everything can change in five years , and nothing in 100 .

Scientists have cloned genetically modified piglets that may prove a safe source of organs for transplants into humans .
The 15 black-headed piglets , born in a lab in southwest China 's Yunnan Province , do not carry the active infectious viral gene which has impeded the process of pig-to-human transplantation for more than a decade , said Chinese members of an international research team who released their findings Friday .
Pigs have porcine endogenous retroviruses ( PERVs ) embedded in their genome . These viruses are able to jump from a pig cell to a human when mixed in the lab . The viruses can then be passed to fresh human cells from the infected one .
This standing block was cleared when the scientists using a gene-editing technique , known as CRISPR , inactivate the PERVs .
Geneticist Luhan Yang and their colleagues at the American biotech startup eGenesis are behind the breakthrough .
Yang , co-founder and chief scientific officer of eGenesis , joined professors from several Chinese universities and one from Denmark to pen the study published on the Science journal on Friday .
With modified genes , the scientists created PERV-inactivated pig embryos and transferred them into surrogate sows to produce clones , in the same fashion as Dolly the sheep was created .
Earlier this year , 37 such clones were produced by 17 sows in Yunnan Agricultural University .
Today , 15 are still alive with ages ranging from one to four months . They appeared quite healthy , said Wei Hongjiang , a professor with Yunnan Agricultural University who is one of the lead authors of the publication .
`` We now have the world 's first ever PERV-inactivated pigs , '' Wei told Xinhua . `` For the first time , we have dealt with the concern of cross-species viral transmission risks . ''
They said the international team will move to the next step , using gene editing to make pig organs less prone to attack by their human recipients ' immune systems , which has been another standing obstacle in the research .
George Church , Harvard geneticist and another eGenesis co-founder , called the clones a milestone in xenotransplantation as the most important safety issue had been solved .
Xenotransplantation means to use animal living cells , tissues or organs in people to bridge the shortfall in available human organs .
Yang said the world has more than 2 million patients who need organ transplants . The supply is way below the demand and the gap is only expected to grow wider .
Pig organs are of similar sizes and function to humans ' and are considered the most feasible for xenogeneic transplantation , they said .
In China alone , more than 300,000 patients are waiting for organ transplants but fewer than 10,000 surgeries are performed each year .
The country witnessed a surge of willing organ donors in recent years but far from enough to meet the need .
`` We are working hard on the earliest possible clinical use of xenogeneic transplants to help hundreds of thousands of patients waiting for organ transplants , '' Wei said .
Xenotransplantation remains controversial .
The WHO says while animals are a potential source of high quality , readily available live organs , xenotransplantation carries risks , especially the spread of known or unknown diseases .
It says some very serious diseases such as AIDS and SARS have originated from animals and urges governments to take regulatory control and ensure surveillance mechanisms before allowing xenogeneic transplants to take place .
NABLUS , Palestinian Territories — A baby boy was born by Caesarian section on Monday , the product of a successful smuggling attempt by a Palestinian prisoner who managed to sneak out a sperm sample to their wife .
Baby Muhannad was born in a Nablus hospital to Dallal Ziben , a 32-year-old mother-of-two from a village in the northern West Bank , whose husband Ammar is currently serving 32 life sentences in an Israeli prison .
Palestinians are not permitted to receive conjugal visits , and although Dallal Ziben has not set eyes on their husband for 15 years , they say they fell pregnant after being artificially inseminated by sperm their 37-year-old husband managed to sneak out of Hadarim prison in central Israel .
“ Praise be to Allah who has blessed us after a long absence with my husband in prison , ” Ziben told AFP shortly before going in for an elective Caesarean .
“ My husband and I , our two girls and the family have been waiting for this for such a long time , ” they said .
Ziben , who comes from Meithalun village between Nablus and Jenin , already had an 18-month-old daughter called Basha'er when their husband , who belongs to the Islamist Hamas movement , was arrested .
At the time , they were also five months pregnant with their second daughter , Bissan .
“ I am very happy . This is the first genuine happiness in our house for more than 15 years , ” smiles Basha'er , now 16 .
“ When my mother told us they were going to get inseminated and give us a baby brother , we could n't believe it , ” they said . “ We have always wanted a brother and now the dream has come true . ”
After the expectant mother was wheeled into the operating theatre , a group of women from the family gathered outside to wait , breaking into celebratory ululation at the first sound of a baby crying .
Standing outside the operating theatre , the proud grandmother said their son-in-law had named the baby after one of their friends “ who was a martyr . ”
Asked if the family objected to the way their daughter fell pregnant , they responded angrily .
“ We are honourable people who are known for our good reputation and everyone supports us , ” they snapped .
For their son-in-law , who no longer has any immediate family living in the Palestinian territories , having a boy gives them a way of prolonging their line , they said , explaining that their mother , father and brother had died , and that a second brother was living overseas .
Details of how the sperm was smuggled out of the prison was kept a closely guarded secret , with the family refusing to give the slightest information .
A spokesperson for the Israel Prisons Service said they were not aware of the pregnancy , and that security prisoners were not allowed conjugal visits , with the Palestinian Prisoners ' Club confirming the same information .
“ Visits by prisoners ' wives are closely supervised by prison guards and there is no way a prisoner could get time alone with their wife , ” said a Nablus-based spokesperson .
Dr Saalem Abu al-Kheizaran , head of the Razan fertility clinic in Nablus which carried out the insemination procedure , said the sperm had been subjected to a gender separation process to ensure the couple would have a son .
“ We received a sample of sperm from the husband in a reliable and clinically secure way , ” they told AFP , without going into details .
“ The couple wanted a baby boy , so we carried out a gender separation procedure . We tried the insemination process three times from the same sample , but the first two attempts failed , ” they said .
Abu al-Kheizaran said the right to have a baby was a universal human right .
“ For us it is a humanitarian issue — everyone has the right to be a parent . Prison must not stand in the way of this right , ” they told AFP .
Samer Samaro from the Nablus branch of the prisoners ' ministry agrees .
“ Having the child is a prisoner 's right . We hope to someday reach an agreement with the Israeli side about this issue , ” they said .
Samaro said that even Israelis were allowed that right , including Yigal Amir , the right-wing extremist who gunned down prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995 .
Amir , who was caught trying to smuggle sperm out of prison in 2006 , was later given permission to artificially inseminate their wife , who gave birth to a son in 2007 .
Says Samaro : “ Even Rabin 's murderer had a baby while they were in prison , so why should Palestinians be deprived of that right ? ”
`` I would want my son to play for him , '' John Kolesar said of Jim Harbaugh . They were Michigan teammates , Harbaugh a quarterback and Kolesar a receiver . ( Photo : Wesley Hitt / Getty Images )
To those who know them best , Jim Harbaugh is the ultimate competitor .
A winner . A motivator . A leader .
They are driven and fiery , confident and cocky , astute and willing to delegate and all about winning and being successful . And now they are Michigan 's new head coach , returning to their alma mater to restore its luster and return it to national prominence .
Harbaugh , 51 , who spent the last four seasons as coach of the San Francisco 49ers after two college head-coaching stops at San Diego and Stanford , will be formally introduced Tuesday at a noon news conference . They are a former Michigan quarterback ( 1982-86 ) who played under legendary coach Bo Schembechler .
Harbaugh has signed their Michigan contract , a source told The Detroit News on Monday night . Terms were not immediately known .
The source spoke to The News on condition of anonymity because Michigan had not announced that Harbaugh had been hired .
Harbaugh replaces Brady Hoke , fired on Dec. 2 after four seasons . This is Michigan 's third head coach since 2008 . Rich Rodriguez was fired in 2011 after three seasons . The Wolverines have gone 46-42 since Lloyd Carr retired after the 2007 season , their 13th as head coach . They have endured three losing seasons , including the most recent 5-7 record . Michigan has n't won a Big Ten title since 2004 .
Harbaugh flew in to Metro Airport with their family on a private jet Monday evening .
Harbaugh 's parents , Jack and Jackie , arrived before their son . They were asked how excited they were about their son taking over at Michigan .
`` Go Blue ! '' Jackie said .
Harbaugh 's Michigan teammates have unwavering confidence in the job they will do and how they will lead .
`` Unequivocally , I would play with them again , '' said John Kolesar , a former Michigan receiver who played with Harbaugh . `` I would want to coach with him , and I would want my son to play for him .
`` I 've seen them work , I 've seen them sacrifice , and I 've seen them want to be better and want great things for himself . They instilled an innate confidence that emanated from them and was absorbed in the huddle by their teammates . He 's been bred for this . ''
Support for Harbaugh
Since interim athletic director Jim Hackett fired Hoke , it was clear their No . 1 target was Harbaugh , who led the 49ers to three straight NFC championship games before failing to make the playoffs this year . They had one year left on their contract with the 49ers , but their relationship with the organization 's management had soured . If Michigan was n't their destination , surely they would have landed with another NFL team .
In the early days of Hackett 's search , the support for Harbaugh mounted quickly . Even Carr was on the Harbaugh bandwagon .
`` If I had a choice , I would choose Jim Harbaugh , '' Carr told The News in early December . `` But it will be Jim Hackett 's decision , and that is as it should be . ''

Hackett was appointed the interim athletic director by new president Mark Schlissel after Dave Brandon resigned . Hackett is a former CEO of Steelcase and a player at Michigan . Schembechler was the coach then , and Jack Harbaugh , father of Jim and John , the Baltimore Ravens ' coach , also was on the staff .
Schembechler recognized early that Jim Harbaugh was something special .
`` He was an ornery little devil when I first knew him , '' Schembechler told the Los Angeles Times in a 1986 article before the Rose Bowl . `` He was always under foot , getting in everybody 's way . If I kicked them out of the locker room once , I kicked them out a dozen times , but they always came back . ''
Schembechler related an amusing anecdote to the Times , remembering one day when they stepped into their office and found Harbaugh , then a 9-year-old , with their feet propped on the coach 's desk .
Schembechler said , `` Well , how are you doing today , Jim ? ''
Harbaugh responded , `` I 'm doing fine , Bo . How are you doing ? ''
Schembechler said they later told Jack Harbaugh about the incident , adding , `` You know , I like that boy of yours . I like their attitude . ''
Shades of Schembechler
All these years later , Harbaugh has shades of Schembechler .
`` He 's taken what they learned from Bo , and they modernized it and put their spin on it , '' said former teammate , All-American offensive lineman John `` Jumbo '' Elliott said . `` He has great enthusiasm , and they have that intensity . ''
And a winner 's attitude is something Harbaugh has always possessed .
It is what their former teammates and coaches believe they can restore at Michigan .
In an interview earlier this month with The News , Derrick Walker , a former Michigan tight end who played two seasons with Harbaugh , said they believe the former quarterback would be a huge boost for the program on so many levels .
`` He is a winner , '' Walker said . `` Jim has a lot of confidence . It 's borderline ego and confidence , but as a quarterback they have to have that . Tell me a quarterback who has played at that level and does n't have an ego ?
`` I would love to have them here . It would put us in a place where we have n't been in the last eight to 10 years , no disrespect to Rich Rodriguez or Brady Hoke . It would bring instant credibility . They bring a winning culture . ''
Former Ohio State linebacker Chris Spielman played against Harbaugh in the mid-1980s and respected them for sharing what they call an `` uber-competitive '' nature . Spielman , now a college football analyst for ESPN , said last week that Harbaugh at Michigan instantly upgrades the Big Ten and gives Ohio State coach Urban Meyer , whose Buckeyes have made the four-team playoff , a rival equal to the task .
`` It would be great for Michigan , great for the Big Ten , '' Spielman said . `` It restores some of the history of the rivalry of two great coaches with two great schools doing battle .
`` He 's a guy Michigan needs to rival Urban as far as name , coaching ability , and recruiting – they can probably go toe-to-toe with Urban in recruiting . That 's vital for Michigan to start getting guys on the national level that are highly rated who want to be Michigan guys , and Jim can do that . ''
What about the recruits ?
As speculation swirled Sunday about Harbaugh 's departure from the 49ers to the Wolverines , high school football recruits weighed in on several recruiting websites and said the Harbaugh name definitely turns heads . Spielman said Harbaugh as a recruiter should not be underestimated .
`` ( Michigan does ) have a strong base in recruiting , but I do n't know if every college kid in Florida knew who Brady Hoke was -- I guarantee you , everyone knows who Jim Harbaugh is , '' Spielman said . `` The other thing they carry -- and do n't underestimate this , I would n't -- they could go in to any kid 's house and say , ' I 'm an NFL coach , and I know what it takes to get you there . ' I would think that would be their selling point . ''
Michigan students will not return from break until next week , and as Hackett had promised the football players , they will have a coach . What they will have in Harbaugh , whose last college coaching experience was at Stanford from 2007-10 , is a fiery coach , who is every bit as demanding as they were when they were a player at Michigan .
Former Michigan running back Jamie Morris , a Harbaugh teammate , spoke earlier this month of their demanding nature .
`` If they did n't think you were n't giving your all , he 'd yell at you , '' Morris said . `` He loved their teammates and loved being around us , but they expected nothing but the best , and if they are n't getting it , you would hear about it . I mean , they guaranteed a win ( against Ohio State in 1986 ) . Who does that ? And under Bo Schembechler , too ? If Jimmy said we were going to win , we were going to win . That 's how they are .
`` The guy I know is the guy I played with -- that 's why they should be the coach here . ''
Recluse is the solo black metal project of Phil McSorley , who was a member of Cobalt for most of that band 's history so far . The first Recluse demo was released by Graceless Recordings in 2013 , and the next year brought an EP named Frozen Blood and a compilation under the name of The Black Famine . On September 16 , Darker Than Black Records will release the first Recluse LP , Stillbirth In Bethlehem ( with a CD edition coming from Vault of Dried Bones ) .
McSorley plays everything on Stillbirth , but the vocals include not only McSorley 's but also contributions on each track by Wlad Drakksteim of Vlad Tepes in their first recording since that band 's last release , Morte Lune , in 1996 .
For fans of the French black metal collective from the '90s known as Les Légions Noires , the appearance of Wlad will itself be reason enough to dive into this album . Beyond that , Stillbirth could be understood in other ways as an homage to the LNN and such bands as Belkètre , Torgeist , and of course Vlad Tepes itself . But the album is worth hearing even if you know nothing of the Black Legions or ( like me ) have only brushed against the surface of their music .
* * * * * *
It 's an understatement to say that Stillbirth is an intense experience . Listening to it is like entering the mouth of hell , or at least a particular kind of hell . It 's a closed circuit of pain , hatred , violence , and grief .
When I first heard the album , and as you will hear it below , it was as a single track ( and it may eventually be released as such in a later edition ) , even though it consists of 12 tracks , most of them in the two-to-three minute range . I eventually listened to it with an index based on individual song titles and lengths , because otherwise it 's not always clear when one track ends and the next one begins .
Some of these tracks could stand alone , because they are stitched with penetrating melodies . The rest may make sense only in the context of the album as a whole , as tools used to deepen the overall experience — the experience of hurtling into a vortex of horrors .
* * * * * *
Significant portions of the album are composed of eerie , flesh-crawling , deeply unsettling ambient sounds , coupled with the even more unsettling vocals ( which I 'll come back to ) or of dense storms of harsh , abrasive , violent noise — typhoons of distortion , discordance , drone , and feedback .
The tracks in which this horrifying black noise is dominant come on the B-side of the album . The songs that could best stand alone are to be found on Side A . A dismal , rising and falling melody threads its way through the rapidly pulsing drums and violent riffs of “ Canticle of Murder ” . “ Semen and Blood ” courses with a high , vibrating lead guitar melody with a doomed and mournful aura that 's absolutely magnetic .
Another melancholy melody glides over the bleak and seething maelstrom that bears the name “ Wine of Rape ” . The first song on the B-side , “ Defleshed Galilean ” , is warlike and vicious , yet it too includes searing , aching melodic components as well as a hell of a catchy riff near the end .
Where they appear , the melodies are simple , but crafted in a way that gets their hooks in your head , while your head is being torn apart by the assault of other forces . They are beleaguered and devastated in their mood , a painful glimpse of humanity in an otherwise inhuman and terrifying descent into a hostile realm of derangement and disgust . ( The sound of birdsong and rushing water in the album 's closing track is about the only other touchstone to a world that is n't being ripped apart . )
* * * * * *
From beginning to end , the album is beset by a pack of monsters . The voices of McSorley and Wlad Drakksteim are undoubtedly terrifying instruments by themselves , but they have been further distorted , twisted , and mutilated by a variety of effects , and the results are frequently layered to produce a cacophony of unhinged and inhuman expressions — reptilian growling , gurgling , howling , shrieking , feeding , regurgitating , gasping , groaning .
A convocation of demons in a blood frenzy could not be any more disconcerting or chilling in its effect than what comes from the throats of Wlad and McSorley , as further tortured by the latter 's electronic manipulations . Those unnerving sounds are an inseparable part of the album 's mind-shattering impact .
* * * * * *
I listen to , and enjoy , a lot of extreme , abrasive , violent metal , and I occasionally dabble in harsh noise . Even so , this album is out on the edge of my usual listening . It pushes the limits of audio terror with torrential gales of tuneless , rhythm-less , harrowing , discordant sound . It seems devoted to the creation of an atmosphere of ugliness and suffering , or simply the expression of a fractured and sinking soul .
I 'm virtually certain that I do n't share or probably even understand the feelings and thoughts that inspired and are expressed by this album . Of course , I despise and detest certain individuals — who does n't ? But with my almost invariably sunny disposition and general tolerance and even enjoyment of most people I meet , I doubt I have much in common with McSorley .
In my case , that does n't matter enough to turn me away from this album , even though I 'm sure it will matter a lot to others . In my case , there is something about the experience of listening to Stillbirth In Bethlehem that feeds the need for raw , brain-scraping , soul-scouring emotional intensity in music . Beyond that , the technique and obvious care that went into the creation of this disturbing experience are also worth appreciating . And the songs that have a melodic component pierce the heart in a compelling way — just as they try to claw it into tatters .
* * * * * *
A full stream of the album is below , formatted as a single track . I 've included an index to the track list and run-times . As mentioned , Darker Than Black Records will release the LP , while Vault of Dried Bones is now offering pre-orders for a CD edition ( here ) , and a tape is expected as well .

The Detroit Lions have 19 * pending unrestricted free agents , and we 're spending three weeks counting down each player and examining how or whether they fit into the future of the team .
Free agency opens March 10 , the Lions can re-sign any of their players before the start of the new league year , and they can use the franchise or transition tag on one player now through Monday .
Rashean Mathis
Age : 34
Position : CB
Other CBs under contract for 2015 : Darius Slay , Nevin Lawson , Bill Bentley , Mohammed Seisay , Crezdon Butler
Other CBs entering free agency : Cassius Vaughn , Josh Thomas
How acquired : Signed as a free agent in August 2013
2014 stats : 16 GP , 16 GS , 51 tackles , 1 INT
2014 salary : $ 955,000
The future : Mathis has proved ageless in their two seasons with the Lions , playing at a high level and providing invaluable leadership in the locker room . Lions general manager Martin Mayhew said last week that they want Mathis back , and Mathis said after the season that they think they have a couple years left in them and wants them to be in Detroit . The Lions would n't budge from their minimum salary benefit offer last year , and it 's not likely that they 'll go much higher this year , considering Mathis ' age and their salary cap situation . At some point , the two sides should reach a deal , though Mathis ' role could evolve to include more nickel duties , depending on whom the Lions add at the cornerback position .
Next up : Nick Fairley
* Previous versions of this series showed the Lions with 20 unrestricted free agents , as the team and NFL Players Association disagreed on George Johnson 's free agent status . They since has been declared a restricted free agent and could draw interest from other teams , depending on their tender level .

You and I continue to foot a large part of the bill for America 's billionaire sports owners .
As the 2015 NFL season kicks off and all the excitement that comes along with it , let us not forget that U.S. taxpayers are bearing a large part of the cost . In the past 15 years alone , over $ 12 billion of the public 's money has gone to privately owned stadiums—constituting essentially a massive transfer of wealth from everyday Americans to the super-rich owners and players involved in these billion-dollar sports franchises . The Dallas Cowboys ushered in the era of the billion-dollar stadium when their current facility opened in 2009 . Taxpayers assumed the cost for over a quarter ( $ 325 million ) of its $ 1.2 billion dollar price tag . At the under-construction U.S. Bank Stadium , where the Minnesota Vikings will eventually play , public dollars account for roughly half the cost—an estimated $ 498 million—of the total $ 1.06 billion bills . Although Minneapolis initially required a public referendum to approve funding for the stadium , a “ stadium authority ” was able to override the referendum and authorize the budget without taxpayers ' consent .
The Atlanta Falcons ' new Mercedes-Benz Stadium—not to be confused with the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans—is slated to open in 2017 at a projected cost of $ 1.5 billion , with the public picking up an estimated $ 600 million of its tab . Even Buffalo , where the existing Bills stadium received $ 130 million in public funding last year for renovations , is considering building a new , $ 800 million to $ 1 billion NFL facility . The decision to build or renovate stadiums is not one that cities make on their own . The NFL can and does apply pressure for stadiums to be upgraded if they 're not seen as up to par . In 2010 , the league threatened to take Miami out of the running for future Super Bowls unless its stadium was substantially renovated after rain marred the 2007 edition of the game there . When lawmakers—reeling from the aftershock of a massive taxpayer subsidy for the Marlins baseball stadium—rebuffed efforts for public financing , the team 's ownership decided to undertake the $ 400 million-dollar-plus renovation , on its own dime . Twenty other NFL stadiums have opened since 1997 , at a cost of nearly $ 5 billion in taxpayer funds , according to one analysis . Judith Grant Long , a leading expert on sports stadium funding at the University of Michigan , estimates that taxpayers have actually spent as much as $ 10 billion more on professional sports stadiums and arenas than is typically acknowledged after various hidden costs are taken into account .
The threat of relocation One tactic that is frequently employed to get the public to fork over money is to threaten to move a beloved team to a new city . The Baltimore Colts moved to Indianapolis in 1984 , after Baltimore failed to accommodate the team 's demands for a new stadium . Owner Robert Irsay shopped the team to several cities , including Phoenix and Jacksonville , before settling on Indianapolis , which had a new stadium built and waiting for an NFL team . Cities are changing fast . Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter . The best way to follow issues you care about . Subscribe Loading ... In 1996 , Art Modell moved the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore , where they became the Baltimore Ravens and acquired a new $ 200 million stadium . ( On the day after their move was announced , Cleveland residents voted decisively to remodel their own stadium . ) After three years , the NFL created a new expansion team for Cleveland—the cost of which was yet another new stadium . In 2014 , the San Francisco 49ers moved from their historic home at Candlestick Park to the $ 1.3 billion Levis Stadium in Santa Clara after a protracted bidding war between the two cities . Santa Clara taxpayers ended up on the book for between $ 150 and $ 200 million in subsidies—an amount that exceeds the entire city 's annual budget of $ 140 million . Currently , Los Angeles—which has no NFL team after losing the Rams to St. Louis and the Raiders back to Oakland in the mid-1990s—is chomping at the bit for a pro football franchise ( a situation reflected in a key plotline of this season 's Ray Donovan ) . A plan is being floated around , modeled on the 49ers deal , to build a $ 1.7 billion stadium in Carson City that could host two teams at once—the Raiders and the San Diego Chargers . This has , not surprisingly , generated counterproposals from both Oakland and San Diego , who are seeking to retain their teams . San Diego has proposed a $ 1.4 billion stadium adjacent to the existing Qualcomm Stadium , backed with as much as a billion in public subsides . Oakland has countered with a $ 900 million stadium to keep the Raiders in town as part of a much a larger $ 4.2 billion mixed-use development deal .
The threat of moving a team puts cities and their mayors on the proverbial hot seat : They can either ante up the dough or watch their fan 's beloved team go elsewhere . As Stanford University 's Roger Noll , a leading expert on sports economics , points out : “ Cities have very little bargaining power with an NFL team . As long as there are cities without NFL teams that are willing to subsidize a stadium , cities will have to pay part of the cost of a new stadium. ” What mayor or council wants to be on the hook for that ? Supporting billionaire owners may look bad , but sitting idly while the local team moves to another city can also mean getting tossed out of office . The stark reality is that cities and their leadership are mainly complicit in stadium boondoggles . Even when residents vote down these deals , they often frequently reappear under the guise of stadium development authorities and other non-democratic ways to obtain public funding . A comprehensive 2006 study of the local growth coalitions of business and politicians that foist stadium deals on taxpayers found that public officials are frequently active participants in stadium shakedowns—far from the neutral brokers they like to claim . The study concludes that “ the default position of local governments ( with only rare exceptions ) is to believe in the wonders of publicly subsidized sports stadiums . '' Subsidizing stadiums is an economic disaster The overwhelming conclusion of decades of economic research on the subject is that using public funds to subsidize wealthy sports franchises makes zero economic sense and is a giant waste of taxpayer money . A wide array of studies has shown that professional teams add virtually no income to local economies . In fact , some of them find that large subsidies actually have a negative effect , taking money out of the local economy . Aside from the jobs generated by actually building the stadium , most jobs inside the stadium—selling food and beer or working at team concessions—are low-paying temp jobs . It 's even worse for football stadiums , which are used for games at most a dozen times a year , and maybe a few more times for concerts or large events . Public economic development dollars can be put to much better use on things besides subsidizing sports teams and their wealthy owners .
Ultimately , the burden of public subsides falls disproportionately on small cities that are the least able to bear the cost . For example , a $ 200 million public subsidy for a new stadium ends up costing a small city like Santa Clara roughly $ 1,650 per resident , compared to just $ 50 a person for L.A. And , of course , teams in bigger cities , with their bigger markets and more revenue , often do not need subsidies at all . Stop the madness It 's time put an end to runaway public subsidies to lucrative sports franchises . Is there any other industry or field of business where taxpayers are asked to hand over astronomical sums to billionaire owners and their millionaire employees ? If cities and states can not stop themselves , it 's up to the federal government to step in . As Andrew Sharp put it recently at Grantland : “ Is n't this what the federal government is for ? If there 's interstate commerce that wreaks havoc on state and local governments as a rule , should n't Congress step in to legislate the business back to sanity ? ” I could not agree more . Sports economists suggest using federal antitrust laws to keep professional sports teams and leagues in line—something Congress has been reluctant to enforce . President Obama 's 2016 budget proposal called for a ban on using tax-exempt municipal bonds to fund stadiums , but in the current climate , Congress does not appear likely to act on it . It 's high time to stop this madness once and for all .

That 's good news for fans of superhero movie music who have seen a bi-polar split between the serious sound of more recent Batman and Superman movies at DC and the triumphant and bombastic sounds of Marvel 's films .
“ Marvel 's vibe is more old school , more heroic , ” said Tyler Bates ( “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” ) . “ DC seems darker , post-apocalyptic . ”
John Ottman , who recently scored “ X-Men : Days of Future Past , ” said the now-classic “ Superman ” and “ Batman ” scores by John Williams and Danny Elfman served as a “ resurrection of the film score . It gave license to the composer to write an original lyrical score which is rare these days . ”
“ They brought back themes to scores , ” added Blake Neely , who also composes around 35 minutes of music for each episode of “ Arrow ” and the upcoming series “ The Flash. ” “ It gave kids tunes to sing after they saw these movies , which is definitely intimidating to us . There are certainly scores that have raised the bar so high you do n't want to top it . ”

With “ The Avengers ” sequel , Tyler ( “ Iron Man 3 , ” “ Thor : The Dark World ” ) will attempt to reference the “ Iron Man , ” “ Thor ” and “ Captain America ” films in order to create a similar musical universe . “ That 's the goal for sure , ” they said . “ You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it . ”
Tyler , who also scored the upcoming “ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , ” said that film will feature a new theme , but still provide references to the animated series . The sound is mostly made up of an orchestra and choir . “ It does have moments where we give the wink of the eye for sure , ” Tyler said .
For “ Guardians of the Galaxy , ” writer-director James Gunn told Bates “ we 're making a space rock opera , ” which led the composer to create “ my most purely orchestral choral score ever , mostly because of time . ”
The film 's music features little of Bates ' signature guitar riffs , given that they only had three hours to record queues . “ I wanted to keep it purely orchestral and draw inspiration from movies of the past rather than what 's happening currently , ” they said .
When asked how they balance both editing films and writing a score on their movies , with the composer recently doing double duty on “ X-Men : Days of Future Past , ” Ottman said “ I eliminate every joyful thing in my life ; all dinners out , all movies , everything interpersonal is eliminated . That 's the only way I can do it . It sounds dour but it 's true . ”
Ottman initially planned to write the score for the “ X-Men ” film in December , but the date kept shifting and did n't happen until the end of January . The music was recorded in April .
“ The advantage is I know the film and its issues better than anyone ever could , ” Ottman said . “ The problem is the time to write it . ”
When it comes to collaborating with directors or stars who also produce , Beck noted Tom Cruise “ was definitely involved ” with “ Edge of Tomorrow. ” “ He has their fingerprints on it . ”
Beck , who also scored Disney 's “ Frozen , ” said they get a lot of credit for writing the film 's hit song “ Let It Go , ” “ and now I just say thank you . ”
Many of the songs already had been written , and “ there are a lot of songs written for the movie that were n't used than were used , ” Beck said .
Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes Proposition 19 , which would legalize the recreational use of marijuana , but they offered a consolation Thursday by signing a bill that would downgrade possession of an ounce or less from a misdemeanor to an infraction .
SB 1449 was written by state Sen. Mark Leno ( D-San Francisco ) , who said it will keep marijuana-related cases from going to court-clogging jury trials , although the penalty would remain a fine of up to $ 100 but no jail time .
`` Notwithstanding my opposition to Proposition 19 , however , I am signing this measure because possession of less than an ounce of marijuana is an infraction in everything but name , '' Schwarzenegger wrote in a signing message .
`` In this time of drastic budget cuts , prosecutors , defense attorneys , law enforcement , and the courts can not afford to expend limited resources prosecuting a crime that carries the same punishment as a traffic ticket . ''
The governor 's action was denounced by Randy Thomasson , president of saveCalifornia.com .
`` This virtual legalization of marijuana definitely sends the wrong message to teenagers and young adults , '' Thomasson said . “ It invites youth to become addicted to mind-altering pot because there 's not much hassle and no public stigma and no rehab if they 're caught . ''
Not surprisingly , the governor was praised by Dale Gieringer , director of California NORML , which supports legalization .
`` Gov . Schwarzenegger deserves credit for sparing the state 's taxpayers the cost of prosecuting minor pot offenders , '' Gieringer said . `` Californians increasingly recognize that the war on marijuana is a waste of law enforcement resources . ''
The new law takes effect Jan 1 , 2011 .

Leap Motion , a hand tracking company , has just raised $ 50 million funding for its continued development of its hand tracking system . Why is there a massive focus on gesture control for VR and where is VR/AR currently being implemented ?
Leap Motion 's Capital Gain
Despite advances in computing power , one of the major limitations in technology is us and our senses . While we may have computers that are capable of generating environments in real time , our interaction with said environments is still mostly via keyboard and mouse . We still largely perceive these generated images displayed on screens with the same dimensional capabilities of the first TVs .
While 3D TVs and gesture control do exist , they are still in their infancy . Augmented reality ( AR ) and virtual reality ( VR ) are the next step in immersive technology , but they still seem fairly far in the future at this point . Google tried to enter the augmented reality market with their Google Glass but was criticized for the privacy policy ( and the less-than-stylish fashion statement ) . However , such difficulties have not stopped many companies from trying to create products that will spark the VR/AR explosion , which could see many individuals throwing out their keyboards and mice for a VR/AR interface .
One of these companies , Leap Motion , with the help of J.P Morgan Asset Management , has raised $ 50 million in funding from multiple investors to pursue their gesture control for VR/AR technology . Such an investment is an indication that the industry has taken a genuine interest in changing how we interact with computers . So what does Leap Motion do and how does it work ?
Leap Motion is making real progress in the world of gesture control . Image courtesy of Leap Motion .
The Leap Motion Platform
The Leap Motion Mobile VR platform is a combination of hardware and software to provide hand tracking so that the user can interact with a computer-generated environment with their hands as opposed to devices such as keyboards and mice . For comparison , the Oculus Rift may display an environment with perspective , but it 's lacking in this ability to interact .

The hardware is based around an ARM processor ( CYUSB3014-BZXI ) , two small IR cameras , and several IR emitters . It can be mounted on most headsets to stream image data to a computer . The headset 's dual infrared cameras , being wide angle lenses , obtain a nearly 180-degree field of vision .
Once the IR image has been captured , the ARM processor ( a fast USB controller at 200MHz ) stores this data in RAM and alters the data to optimize the resolution . Once this is done , the controller streams the data to a computer where Leap Motion Service decodes the images to produce the augmented reality data ( i.e. , the position of the user 's hands and fingers ) .
Interestingly , the Leap Motion Software transmits the final VR/AR data over TCP , which allows for most internet-enabled devices to interact with the controller , including smart phones .
Other VR/AR Users
Leap Motion is producing products for use with augmented and virtual reality , but who are they selling their software to ? What end applications currently exist for gesture control and how do they hold up against classic forms of interfacing ?
As it turns out , there are plenty of companies who are selling or developing products with gesture control in mind . One example is the DJI Spark drone which is entirely controlled with gestures as opposed to a controller that one would expect to find on an areal vehicle . The drone , launched from the palm , automatically flies away from the user and can be controlled with hand gestures . For example , the user can raise their hand to instruct the drone to fly upward and then make a square with their fingers to have the drone capture a high-tech `` selfie '' picture of the user .
However , while this may sound impressive , the gesture control has still yet to be improved as there are some concerns about the drone 's responsiveness . But , if improved , such devices could prove critical in situations where a controller is impractical ( such as disaster relief and military scenarios ) .

Gesture controls are also finding their way into aid devices , including a glove that can be worn by those who are deaf . A hearing-impaired person may struggle to interact with interfaces such as Siri which rely on spoken commands . The gloves , still in research , can track hand movements and translate sign language into commands that can be understood by voice / text activated systems .
NASA 's also been looking into gesture control and virtual reality for the purpose of training future astronauts . The move comes from the impracticalities of controllers used during VR training and so NASA aims to replace such controllers with TENZR straps .

The Importance of Gesture Control in VR/AR
Virtual reality and augmented reality are starting to become commercialized—by the Oculus Rift , for example . But their uses go far beyond the applications of entertainment and gaming . Virtual realities allow for users to immerse themselves in simulated environments , a concept that could be applied in many extraordinary circumstances .
For example , students could use such technology to view the world from different timelines and immerse themselves in an environment and live history instead of reading about it . Archaeologists could use VR to view a historical site as it stood and gain insights to how ancient civilizations would have viewed such monuments .

For augmented reality to become viable , however , it must be integrated with advanced gesture control . Augmented reality relies on creating an environment that is superimposed on the current surroundings ( such as Google Glass ) , and so interaction through gesture control is a no-brainier . Augmented reality could benefit many industries just like virtual reality where they can change and shape the world around them .
Implementing gesture control allows for true interaction with the virtual environment which opens up endless possibilities for many industries . For example , engineering firms could use a virtual environment to simulate their product while users can interact with the device as if it were real to show potential problems and improvements . The medical field could greatly benefit from such technology by training surgeons in an environment where surgeons could improve their motor skills and gain insight that could only normally be found in real operations .
The applications are nearly endless and they could have serious repercussions on how we see the world and how we learn .

Where Is Gesture Control Now ?
Gesture control is still in its infancy and needs plenty of work before it 's ready for true mainstream acceptance . However , this is not a reason for potential investors and the industry as a whole to shy away from either developing or implementing gesture control . After all , the company that first produces flawless gesture control will have a huge portion of the market in their pocket .
While the mouse has been a great companion for the past few decades , the keyboard has been truly faithful ever since its inception with the typewriter . However , as stated before , computer technology is ever advancing and yet we continue to use technology that seriously impedes our ability to interact with it . That alone is enough to suggest that we may be on the verge of a transformation which would mark a pivotal moment in computing history .
Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham said on Monday that President Trump once told them that they thought they could have made a deal to avert the Civil War .
“ It 's a projection of the president 's fundamental and enveloping narcissism , ” Meacham said on MSNBC 's `` Morning Joe . '' “ He told me a year ago that they thought they could have done a deal to have averted the war . ”

Trump faced immediate backlash on Monday for their comments on the Civil War during an interview with the Washington Examiner . They insinuated that President Andrew Jackson , who died 16 years before the war began , could have prevented the war had they served in office later .
`` I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you would n't have had the Civil War . They were a very tough person , but they had a big heart , '' Trump said . `` He was really angry that they saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War , they said , 'There 's no reason for this . ' ''
Trump also questioned why the Civil War was n't prevented .
`` People do n't ask that question , but why was there the Civil War ? Why could that one not have been worked out ? ” Trump said .
Meacham told `` Morning Joe '' that Trump is confusing history .
“ What he 's done is he 's taking two unrelated things , largely unrelated things and smashing them together like a couple of blocks , ” Meacham said .
Trump told Fox News 's Tucker Carlson in March that they were “ reading a book on Andrew Jackson ” during their visit to Jackson 's former plantation , The Hermitage , in Nashville , Tenn .
a tale of two conspiracies , or why russian trolls ai n't nuthin ' to take lightly
Welcome to 2016 where the news is made up , reality does n't matter , and conspiracies suddenly start making sense .
This year . This goddamn year . Only in the year where the world has finally gone off the rails does a skeptic have to weigh two conspiracy theories , one of which might actually be real . On the one hand , we have the idea that a bunch of carelessly sent speech to text emails contain secret code words that give away a pedophile sex ring for the rich and powerful in DC , and if this is n't enough , these e-mails also contain evidence that those abused kids are being ritually sacrificed , murdered , and possibly cannibalized . On the other , we have the CIA claiming that Russia blanketed America with propaganda and cherry-picked scandals to get Trump elected because they and their cronies would be highly favorable to advancing their geopolitical goals . And one of these conspiracies has more evidence behind it than the other , especially if we consider that Pizzagate is almost entirely based on anonymous posts on 4Chan and nudge-nudges and wink-winks from the pro-Russian WikiLeaks ' Twitter , while the other seems like a culmination of well-known frustrations with Russia by the CIA and FBI , overstated for the media 's benefit .
Now , I know what some of you are going to say , that this is the CIA 's angry payback for Trump saying that the largest spy network on the planet and all of the agencies it works with are of no use to him , and that considering their tweets , their primary source for intelligence briefings is Alex Jones ' InfoWars , which is too disturbing to joke about . A frequent retort on social media has been some variation of “ our side won the election , shut up you sore whiny losers. ” This is the political “ does n't matter , had sex ” excuse for shutting down any real debate , especially considering how the popular vote actually went down . It may have been in an alley behind a dumpster with someone unconscious , but consequences aside , they scored . And blunt denials do n't take away the actual , long known facts behind the CIA 's clandestine battle with Russian intelligence on the web , and the NSA 's Equation Group 's long-running competition with Putin 's hackers known as Fancy Bear , described in detail over the years by numerous military and op-sec blogs , foreign policy magazines , and occasionally profiled in major publications .
Before we go any further , let 's get some questions settled . There is no way that Russia literally hacked the election . The mechanics of rigging machines in thousands of precincts across America , all disconnected from each other and the web , all requiring different sets of hacks to compromise , with close to two thousand machines in a single key swing state , are absurdly difficult even for a nation state to pull off , especially when they were so closely and carefully watched in the wake of Trump 's rig-baiting . Likewise , it 's not that Russia wanted to secretly run the U.S. At best , it wanted to tip the scales to a candidate who 'd effectively neutralize NATO as a concern for Putin and give it more latitude to reestablish its Soviet-era satellites in Eastern Europe . How aware of this Trump was , or how willing they were to go with it is irrelevant . If anything , Russia was borrowing from the CIA playbook in skewing elections in developing nations during the Cold War , so there 's precedent for this , we saw its digital version in which , true to Mark Twain 's observation , history is not repeating itself , but definitely rhyming as it goes .
What Russia is being accused of doing is hacking the DNC and the RNC at the same time , then only releasing the dirt on DNC through WikiLeaks and advertising them to blogs dealing with partisan outrage clickbait . There 's a bit of evidence out there to indicate that some of the document dumps were fake because they carried Russian metadata linked to Fancy Bear , and we 've already covered the troll factory able to blast it across the web , so we could claim that Russia carried out a successful disinfo campaign . But did it ? One of the infuriating takeaways from the DNC leaks were indications that there was collusion to stop Sanders from securing the nomination in secret so the entire primary process was in effect a Clinton coronation . RNC 's collusion to stop Trump 's nomination was not only public , but the lead story on virtually every media outlet in America . Barring evidence of a scandal that was swept under the rug at the RNC , we have no proof that Russia 's plans had anything more sinister to them than just dumping emails that made Clinton look bad and protecting Trump from embarrassment , but that also does n't work .
If there 's one thing Trump did n't care about , it was a foreign power trying to sanitize their image . They mocked the disabled , spewed racism and sexism , very proudly talked about their international business entanglements , bragged how they could “ grab 'em by the pussy ” because they were famous , and got into a full blown fight with a Gold Star family . Every other day he 'd commit an act that should have been political suicide to emerge unscathed . A Russian proverb states that one must have a conscience to be embarrassed , and lacking it let Trump literally overload the media with their scandals so any single horrible thing they did or said got drowned in the noise . Ultimately , enough voters just did n't care , or even liked their awfulness enough to skew the Electoral vote in their favor to the tune of 100,000 voices . So the next question is whether that anti-Clinton blitz fueled by Russia helped sway just enough people to pull it off . Again , it 's hard to say because it 's been a legitimately rough year for the part of America that ended up being Trump country and attempting to point to any one thing that altered the outcome of the election is Monday morning quarterbacking , to follow a Russian saying with an American cliche .
At the same time , we do have a president-elect who praises Russia , who has no use for NATO , prefers to get their news from partisan conspiracy theorists , is disinterested in actually running the nation day to day , and whose current top pick for Secretary of State is literally a friend of Putin as well as a major contributor to global warming denialist groups . There 's also some history of Russia 's indirect financing of their overseas ventures , a totally unprecedented , at least in modern times , refusal to release their tax paperwork that blatantly screams of obfuscation , and their immediate anger at the CIA for suggesting a Russian hand in American politics rather than a measured nonsense vow to investigate that would be expected in this scenario . All of these pieces really want to add up to something , do n't they ? Especially when Russia has been publicly funding Trump 's counterpart Marie LePen in France and neo-Nazis in Greece to play on internal political tensions in their target states . They 've pulled the exact same tricks in Georgia with shenanigans in South Ossetia , and in Ukraine with the annexation of Crimea and “ clandestine ” support for Donetsk . Putting rural against urban in the U.S. also fits their now standard divide and conquer pattern of asymmetric warfare .
Yet , as with conspiratorial ideation in general , we may be seeing too much of a pattern where there is n't a cohesive picture . Our media already does a great job of pitting rural and urban America against each other , and Trump raging at the CIA fits a pattern of them lashing out against anything that may minimize what they see as their ultimate victory , which is the typical behavior of a textbook narcissist . Let 's not pretend that he 's playing chess when he 's actually playing tic tac toe . Rex Tillerson is an oil tycoon and any oil tycoon has to be friendly with Putin to get a share of that sweet Siberian crude and rights to the now opening Northwest Passage to ship it to America . Even the dismal picks Trump is making for their administration that seem like he 's very deliberately trying to undermine every government function could be easily explained by the fact that they blew up the Republican party and alienated all the experienced , moderate operatives who are open to compromise and had a healthy respect for the government 's basic institutions .
But still , Russia definitely has a strong relationship with WikiLeaks and long standing distaste for Clinton and Obama , everything we just covered about their malicious hand in Western politics has been public knowledge for any follower of international news , and there is the bizarre episode in which an intelligence briefing from the CIA on whether Russia is trying to mess with the election in September prompted threats from Mitch McConnell that he 'd turn any attempt to launch any inquiries into this into a scandal . Today , their wife is nominated as the Secretary of Transportation . And we are still being denied a look at Trump 's taxes and told to trust them that there 's nothing the least bit shady in their checkered past connecting them to Russia , even though this sort of lack of disclosure and as much as a rumor of massive debts kills any chance for a top secret clearance as well as any military-related job for a regular Joe . No matter how skeptical we are , there are still some dark , dark things and bizarre doings , and certainly the CIA is alarmed by them .
Which brings me to what might sound like my own weird conspiracy theory that this furor about Russia is the CIA either acting on something they know but do n't want to disclose , or have a strong hunch about something and are using the fact that the election is over to demand a license to investigate in spite of partisan politics because as an intelligence agency , they can afford to think beyond election cycles . Ultimately , they may be trying to counteract all this newfound Russian influence in Western politics and stymie their social media trolls . After all , what politician would want to risk coming across as a stooge for the Kremlin today , after Americans won the first Cold War ? Does McConnell really think they can get away with millions thinking they may have sold out to the Russians to keep their party in power and get their wife a cushy executive branch job ? Do the Republicans really want to go down as the One Russia of America ? This is what the CIA may be trying to hint to them .
Having been born in the Soviet Union , I can tell you firsthand they deserved to lose the Cold War , and that the lawlessness and blatant enrichment of its oligarchs led to a kleptocracy which Putin rules with an iron fist . Him trying to flex their geopolitical muscles to the detriment of American influence is not to be taken lightly , and if your position is that it does n't matter what they do or who they help as long as your party somehow ends up in power , you have loudly and proudly proclaimed that you 're a partisan first and an American second . Geopolitics can be a really nasty game in which all nations compete with each other to defend their interests , and if our ability to do so could be compromised with Trump 's debts and whatever is hiding in the finances he 's refusing to release to anyone , and the business interests they say they will hand over to a blind trust but is actually giving to their kids , and the CIA is trying to raise a red flag about this , we owe it to ourselves to let them investigate . Yes it sounds asinine that the CIA may investigate a president-elect and how they ran , but this is the nucking futs world in which we live today…
Editor 's Note : Normally , rape analogies are not something which I 'd use , and to come up with the elaboration , I ran the idea by my wife who rolled up their sleeves , said “ hold my beer ! ” and Brock Turnered the shit out of it . The end result was just too savage not to use . Even though I started Weird Things when this kind of thing was n't what you 'd put on a proper skeptical blog , considering this year , we did n't simply lower the bar for everyone , we sold that yuge motherfucker for meth money to China , and leased the space where it was to Russian oligarchs . So screw it , savage it is .
A 28-year-old business person is being accused of stealing $ 1 billion from Moldovan banks over the course of three days .
The sum -- which is equivalent to 12 % of Moldova 's GDP -- mysteriously disappeared in November 2014 .
The impoverished ex-Soviet nation 's central bank was so puzzled by the fraud that it hired a leading financial investigation consultancy called Kroll to help it get to the bottom of the case .
Kroll identified 28-year-old Ilan Shor as the mastermind behind the mega fraud , but its findings were not immediately released .
Shor is one of the richest people in the country and is married to a Russian pop star . Their father accumulated much of the family 's wealth by setting up Moldova 's first duty-free shops .
The speaker of the Moldovan parliament published the confidential report from Kroll after thousands of people protested in the country 's capital early this month .
Shor issued a statement to local media denying any wrongdoing .

The report said Shor and their associates worked together in 2012 to buy a controlling stake in three Moldovan banks and then gradually increased the banks ' liquidity through a series of complex transactions involving loans being passed between the three banks and foreign entities .
The three banks then issued multimillion-dollar loans to companies that Shor either controlled or was connected to , the report said .
In the end , over $ 767 million disappeared from the banks in just three days through complex transactions . The central bank estimates the total loss from the scheme could reach $ 1 billion .
A large portion of this money was transfered to offshore entities connected to Shor , according to the report . Some of the money was then deposited into Latvian bank accounts under the names of various foreigners .
Moldova 's central bank was subsequently forced to bail out the three banks with $ 870 million in emergency loans , a move designed to keep the economy afloat .
Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe and corruption is a widespread problem . The World Bank has even highlighted that this case threatens to destabilize Moldova 's economy .

The Kroll report highlights the difficulties of the investigation . Internal reports detailing activities of the three banks were lost . Important electronic data was also deleted .
On top of it all , a van that was transporting crucial files was stolen and later found burned . Needless to say , the documents were destroyed .
The report said a full forensic investigation is needed to identify other potential beneficiaries and recover the funds .
Shor has been charged with corruption and placed under house arrest , according to Victoria Tinmus from Moldova 's National Anticorruption Center .
Kroll has not responded to CNN 's requests for comment .
Here 's a statistic that Opposition Leader Tony Abbott , the former trainee Catholic seminarian who insists that no other nation is pricing carbon , might find interesting . The number of people living in countries with carbon taxes or emission trading schemes will rise to about one billion by the end of the year . There are almost as many of them in the world as there are Catholics .
Abbott may wish this fact out of existence , but if US President Barack Obama has their way — as announced in their State of the Union ( SOTU ) address yesterday — and the world 's biggest economy introduces a market-based system to limit carbon emissions , that global carbon headcount would jump by 300 million or so by the end of 2014 .
If China goes ahead with its pilot carbon schemes in a bunch of provinces and cities , and prepares for a wider scheme , that would add another 1.4 billion . Abbott may find themselves taking Australian voters to a double dissolution election — where they would seek to win what would would effectively be a referendum on climate action — by pretending the world is not acting on climate change . To paraphrase and lightly censor a remark made by Climate Change Minister Greg Combet yesterday , it 's a load of bollocks .
So what did Obama say yesterday ?
“ I urge this Congress to get together , pursue a bipartisan , market-based solution to climate change , like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago . But if Congress wo n't act soon to protect future generations , I will . I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take , now and in the future , to reduce pollution , prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change , and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy . ”
Obama was expected to focus on climate change policies in SOTU , after making it a central point of their inauguration address , but the fact that they so specifically championed cap-and-trade has taken many by surprise .
Of course , Obama has said this before . Their message after their first election and in the lead-up to the UN 's Copenhagen climate conference was : the climate science was in , the world needed to act , the US could not afford China and others to get ahead on clean energy ; and if a carbon price was n't approved by Congress , Obama would take other measures .
Here , they are saying much the same thing . They did n't invest much in climate change in their first presidency because they expended so much political capital on Obamacare — and the fear is that they might do the same on gun control .
This time , Obama does not have to worry about seeking re-election , but this is a President very much focused on their legacy . Even in their first term , behind the scenes Obama was making good on at least some of their vows to regulate on climate ; the extension of tax credits to renewable energy , an extensive loans program for new technologies , and tighter emissions and efficiency standards means that the US has , sort of , kept touch with China . It installed as much wind energy capacity as China in 2012 , and about half as much solar PV .
More importantly , the US has lowered its emissions over the last four years . Some of this is the result of the shale gas boom . As David Roberts from Grist noted overnight , Obama 's policy has been to reduce fossil fuel consumption and increase fossil fuel production . Whatever you think of that – “ a politically savvy compromise , an untenable hypocrisy , a little of both , ” as Roberts put it – the gas boom has given Obama critical room to move .
A bill on a carbon price is to be introduced into the US Senate as early as today ( US time ) by independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Democrat Barbara Boxer . Details are scant , but it seems likely to be a form of carbon tax that would impose a “ fee on carbon pollution emissions ” and fund “ historic investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy technologies such as wind , solar , geothermal and biomass ” . It would provide rebates to consumers to offset any efforts by oil , coal or gas companies to raise prices .
Sounds a lot like Australia 's scheme . Of course , with the numbers in the Congress and the implacable opposition of the Tea-Party block of Republicans , it has no chance of passage . That means Obama will go back to their policy of executive , or direct action .
But there 's a big difference between the direct action that Obama envisages — tighter emission controls on coal-fired generators , ambitious energy efficiency standards in cars , a doubling of renewable energy targets , a doubling of “ energy productivity ” , as well as a continuation of the loans program to push through new technology innovation — than the wishy-washy “ Direct Action ” plan of Abbott . They remain bizarrely fixated on their 18,000-strong “ green army ” and working bees . Abbott wants to give handouts of taxpayers ' money to achieve the sort of efficiencies from polluters that Obama will make compulsory .
The man chosen by the Republicans to rebut Obama 's speech was Florida Senator Marco Rubio , a Tea Party favourite dubbed the “ crown prince ” of the movement . Just as Abbott earlier this month wondered why the carbon price had not changed the climate after six months , Rubio dipped into the climate denier 's handbook by claiming the government can not control the weather .
“ We can pass a bunch of laws that will destroy our economy , but it is n't going to change the weather , ” said Rubio to their preferred audience on Fox News . And this is what Abbott had to say in their stump speech in January : “ Is n't it bizarre that this government thinks that somehow raising the price of electricity is going to clean up our environment , stop bushfires , stop floods , stop droughts ? ”
And just as Abbott has vowed to dump the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and incentives for the new technologies , Rubio railed against “ wasting more taxpayer money on so-called ‘ clean energy ' companies like Solyndra ” . The extent to which Abbott is in lock-step with the Tea Party pin-up boy is uncanny .
Bill Becker , the executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project , says Obama is very likely the “ last American president who can keep us from plunging helplessly off the climate cliff . Judging by their Inaugural and State of the Union speeches , they get that. ” But Becker said the weakness of acting by executive decree is that these decisions can be rescinded by their successor , or a future Congress .
This , of course , is exactly what Abbott proposes to do in Australia . They will trash the CEFC , dismantle the Climate Change department , but they will likely need a double dissolution to deliver on their promise to the repeal the carbon price . And while they may gain control of the lower house on a broader narrative based around taxation , cost of living , and border security – just as the Republicans have – going to the polls on a single issue of climate change and clean energy , with the focus on those policies that would entail , would seem to be a different matter altogether .
As the head of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – if it has n't already been trashed by Joe Hockey 's razor gang – might advise him : “ that would be a very courageous decision , prime minister. ” The Coalition 's newly elected parliamentarians – scanning the proliferation of solar panels on the rooftops of their electorates , international action on climate , and the fate of Tea Party candidates targeted by clean energy lobby groups in the latest Congressional elections – might be inclined to agree .
With the success and popularity of Serif 's Affinity Photo for iPad , it seemed like a given that its companion app , Affinity Designer , would soon make its way to iPad . In a video posted via Twitter earlier this morning , Affinity Designer 's project manager , Matt Priestly , shared a teaser of the app in action .
Synology RT2600ac : The AirPort Extreme replacement .
The video provides just a brief glimpse of Affinity Designer 's app icon , launch splash screen , and a few sample projects . In the video , Priestly opens an outline of a vector image via a split screen view using the Navigator studio , seamlessly moving the image between vector and outline view . They then switches to the Stroke studio to alter the properties of various strokes within the artwork .
The app features a design that 's similar to Affinity Photo for iPad , which comes as no surprise considering that the Mac versions of both Designer and Photo are very much alike . Needless to say , Designer for the iPad looks like a game-changer when it comes to doing graphic design , including icon design , concept art , web mockups , and many other things that designers regularly use an application like Adobe Illustrator for .
To have this much power in a form factor like the iPad is just incredible , and the eventual release of this app only further solidifies the iPad 's place in the personal computing landscape . These are desktop-class apps that afford iPad users many of the same power-user features found in full macOS desktop versions .
It 's quiet in the office today and I 'm feeling mischievous… Who fancies a bit of # affinitydesigner # ipad # shakycam teaser ? 🐱 pic.twitter.com/ZfbSIJY5Vn — Matt Priestley ( @ mattp4478 ) July 12 , 2017
What are your thoughts on the Affinity Designer for iPad teaser ? Personally speaking , I 've always been hyped for the eventual release of such an app , but my excitement just turned up a few notches based on what was displayed on video , and based on the track record established by Serif 's previous release .
When you consider the cost of competing apps , Designer for the Mac is already a great deal at $ 49.99 . If Serif follows the same pattern set by Affinity Photo for iPad , pricing Designer at $ 19.99 , it will be another outright win for iPad creatives .

Could the Lions be tougher to defend without Calvin Johnson ? Quarterback Matthew Stafford thinks so .
`` I think we 're going to do it a little bit differently than we have in the past , '' Stafford said in an interview on SiriusXM NFL Radio on Tuesday . `` We used to feature Calvin , and everybody kind of got theirs after that . I think it 's going to be tougher for defenses , in a certain way , that they do n't know who we 're going to . There 's no guy to key in on . We 're probably just going to spread the ball around a bunch , and a bunch of guys will get a ton of catches , and we 'll be all right . ''
Stafford , who went on to say that Johnson was a `` once-in-a-lifetime type player , '' argued that Golden Tate had a great offseason and that Marvin Jones , a free agent acquired at the top of the market from Cincinnati , is also a valuable stand-in . The team is looking at Jeremy Kerley or T.J. Jones for the slot receiver job and are also hoping that former top-10 pick Eric Ebron grows into the pass-gobbling tight end they projected them as .
While this is fair , and Detroit boasts a stable of adequate pass-catching running backs , there are n't many examples of a Hall of Fame player departing and opening up the offense . The 2000 Dallas Cowboys were no better without Michael Irvin just like the 2001 49ers suffered without Jerry Rice -- in fact , in 2001 , the year after Rice left for the Oakland Raiders , Terrell Owens ' catch and yardage numbers dropped slightly . Rice essentially left a 75-catch hole in the middle of San Francisco 's lineup .
This is the caliber of player we 're talking about here with Johnson , who , when not the primary receiver , was an expert pawn who coordinators could use to take multiple defenders out of the equation .
If nothing else , Detroit did the next best thing with a serious infusion of speed into its offense . Marvin Jones was open enough to earn 103 targets during their final season with the Bengals and undoubtedly aided the continued ascension of A.J . Green . The platoon of Kerley , T.J. Jones , Andre Caldwell and Andre Roberts should at least be formidable out of the slot .
Every quarterback wants to believe what Stafford believes after losing a player like Johnson , and no quarterback ever wants to see their top target go .
Do fans of democratic reform have a single itch that Justin Trudeau did n't promise to scratch this week ? I ca n't think of any . In a 20-minute speech at the Château Laurier on Tuesday , and especially in a policy paper their Liberal party released simultaneously , Trudeau promised to change just about every facet of the way Canada 's governments , elections and Parliament function .
I 'm going to list many—but not all—of Trudeau 's proposals now . If you believe Prime Minister Stephen Harper has essentially been a force for the comprehensive subversion of our democracy , go ahead and roll in this stuff like clover . It 'll be better than a vacation . If the Parliamentary Budget Office 's chain of command had n't really seemed a problem to you before , skip down a few paragraphs and we 'll continue to the analysis portion of our evening 's entertainment .
Okay . Deep breath . Trudeau promised to “ amend the Access to Information Act ” and entrench a “ legislative review of the Access to Information system every five years ; ” they said he 'd ensure single-wicket service for any Canadian who wants access to whatever records the government has about him- or herself .
Trudeau promised to reinstitute secret-ballot elections to the chairpersonship of parliamentary committees , something Jean Chrétien instituted under duress in a doomed attempt to stave off Paul Martin 's reformist hordes almost 15 years ago . He 'll create an “ inclusive , representative , transparent , and accountable process to advise on appointments to the Supreme Court ” —in case you were worried that any process might be accountable and representative , but not inclusive ; or transparent and inclusive , but not accountable . He 'll “ introduce a prime minister 's question period , ” a reform I 've advocated that amounts to telling future PMs they need n't show up to QP the other four days of the week . He 'll “ allow more time for questions and answers , ” blowing up the 35-second shot clock that ensures nobody spends too much time saying anything thoughtful .
He 'll encourage “ the use of online technologies to engage Canadians , ” meaning , I suppose , email .
Related reading : In praise of the parliamentary committees
But , in case the server crashes , he 's also borrowed the NDP 's promise to “ stop the Harper Conservatives ' plan to end door-to-door mail delivery in Canada. ” ( Note that this is not a promise to restore door-to-door delivery where it has been cut again and again since 1980 , merely to cancel further cuts . As Chris Selley has written , this amounts to a pledge to enshrine 2013 as the summit of perfection for Canadian home mail delivery . )
A Trudeau government would : ensure the estimates and public accounts are written using the same accounting methods ; allow all-party parliamentary oversight of “ every government department and agency with national security responsibilities ” ; make the asupervisorstioned parliamentary budget officer “ answerable only , and directly , to Parliament ” ; and never again “ use prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances . ”
The Liberals , in office , would : “ end Stephen Harper 's practice of using inappropriate omnibus bills ” ; ban “ partisan government ads ” ; and put an end to the foul and nefarious practice of allowing private businesses and members of the public to organize debates among federal party leaders . While we wait for that happy day , make sure to tune into City , Omni and CPAC for the Maclean 's national leaders ' debate on Aug. 6 !
But there 's more . ( I feel like I 'm peddling Ginsu knives here . ) A chief science officer ! Equal numbers of men and women in the federal cabinet ! The return of the mandatory long-form census ! A “ prime minister 's youth advisory council ” to ensure . . . to ensure . . . to ensure whatever a prime minister 's youth advisory council would ensure !
Oh , and under Trudeau , 2015 would be “ the last federal election conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system . That 's the system whereby the candidate in your riding with the largest number of votes becomes your MP . What would replace it ? Something . An all-party committee of MPs would consider the possibilities—Proportional representation ? The Australian system , which I 'm sure somebody is just waiting to explain ? —and report back so quickly , a Trudeau government could “ bring forward legislation to enact electoral reform ” within its first 18 months .
HEY ! OVER HERE ! I 'M DONE WITH THE LIST !
So what 's it all mean ? Well , for starters , the Liberal party should have sent this project to Preston Manning , the Reform party 's founding leader , and asked for an endorsement . I have a hard time believing Manning would n't love most of this . I like a lot of it . It makes no sense to write estimates and public accounts in different geek code , and question period would be less awful if everyone had more time to make their points . Canada 's information laws are obsolete . Harper used to say so . Harper used to call for much of what Trudeau now proposes . Part of Trudeau 's challenge is to persuade people they mean it more than Harper did .
There is a Lucy's-football element to democratic reform , forever pulled away at the crucial moment , that makes each generation 's promises harder to believe . Brian Mulroney ran as a reformer , too , after all , and Chrétien , and Harper . Maybe Trudeau 's reforms will seem so sweeping , they 'll be more persuasive . They are essentially running on 20 years of Andrew Coyne columns . It 's so earnest , you could cry .
I keep seeing polls that suggest people believe the health of our democratic system is a pressing national concern . If those polls are right , and if people believe Trudeau 's proposals would make a difference , and if they believe giving them a chance to fix our institutions outweighs any misgivings they have about him , then they can only gain . That sentence has three “ ifs ” in it .
In the background , the life insurance companies are trying to calculate the odds of you killing yourself , and the disability underwriters are trying to guess the likelihood you will not be able to work because of mental illness in the future . Of the 20 or so top insurers I asked to comment , not one would say what odds they were using , adding that they consider their actuarial information proprietary . MassMutual refused to answer any questions or to say why . Allstate referred questions about its practices to an industry trade group , then stopped responding to messages .
The reluctance may be because of a lack of specific data . We just do n't know a lot about who suffered from pregnancy-related mental health issues a generation ago and what became of them .
The practical ramification of that lack of data is this : Now that untold numbers of additional women are going to learn that they have mild to moderate postpartum depression because of increased screening , there is n't a satisfactory answer to the question of whether they ought to pay more for life and disability insurance afterward .
“ To my knowledge , that data does n't exist , ” said , Samantha Meltzer-Brody , the director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the University of North Carolina Center for Women 's Mood Disorders . “ But at what point are we going to penalize people who were never suicidal ? How do we weigh this , or are we going to throw everyone in the same bucket ? ”
Some insurance companies say they may not lump the people who have mild to moderate cases with those who were hospitalized or tried suicide , depending on whether they have the right answers to the companies ' underwriting questions . At Banner Life Insurance Company , women with a single episode of maternal depression could qualify for the best rate if it lasted less than a year and they are not currently taking any medication for the condition . At State Farm , women who have recovered from depression related to childbearing and have no history of other depression may also avoid higher premiums .
Northwestern Mutual said that women with maternal depression typically have an excellent prognosis and most applicants will pay the lowest rates . MetLife and Mutual of Omaha made similar remarks .
Disability insurers may give you coverage but permanently exclude any mental health disorders , so if cancer rendered you unable to work , the coverage would kick in , but not if you had an onset of major depression . Life insurance does n't work this way , though policies generally have a suicide exclusion that lasts for the first year or so , no matter your health history .
At a time when the funding of political parties is the subject of fresh controversy , a new book has claimed that Rajiv Gandhi , as Prime Minister , wanted commissions given by defence suppliers to be pooled and used to fund the `` inescapable expenses of the party '' .
The just-released book , Unknown Facets of Rajiv Gandhi , Jyoti Basu and Indrajit Gupta , is written by former CBI director Dr A P Mukherjee and the claim is based on their conversations with Rajiv in June 1989 , the author has said .
Rajiv , incidentally , was caught in the thick of the Bofors guns bribery scandal at that time and lost power later that year .
`` Rajiv Gandhi was very clear that commissions paid as a routine by most defence dealers should be properly accounted for and not siphoned off by dishonest officials of the armed forces and politicians ... he wanted such payments to be pooled and accounted for , '' Mukherjee has written .
`` This ( elections ) leads to massive fund collections by important party functionaries all over the country , which leads to an almost unbreakable unholy quid pro quo nexus between unscrupulous party functionaries , ministers and business people . I could sense this as the party 's general secretary or even as its youth leader earlier when I had to enter the political arena with considerable reluctance , '' Rajiv told them over coffee , Mukherjee has written .
Rajiv , they say , had come to know that some senior officers of the armed forces had been surreptitiously collecting huge amounts of money as `` commissions '' in most defence purchases , quite often in connivance with some ministers , middlemen and civilian officers as well .
Rajiv , the former CBI director says , `` discussed this problem with some of their trusted colleagues and advisers when it was suggested by some that all commissions as payable or usually paid to middlemen should be banned but the commissions to be given as a matter of routine practice by the suppliers of major defence materials could be pooled under the care of some non-government entity which could be utilised solely for the purpose of meeting the inescapable expenses of the party .

Industrialists who own private company with annual revenues of £62bn have channelled millions of dollars to rightwing causes
It likes to present itself as a grassroots insurgency made up of hundreds of local groups intent on toppling the Washington elite .
But the Tea Party movement , which is threatening to cause an upset in next month 's midterm elections , would not be where it is today without the backing of that most traditional of US political supporters – Big Oil .
The billionaire brothers who own Koch Industries , a private company with 70,000 employees and annual revenues of $ 100bn ( £62bn ) , used to joke that they controlled the biggest company nobody had ever heard of .
Not any more . After decades during which their fortune grew exponentially and they channelled millions of dollars to rightwing causes , Charles and David Koch are finally getting noticed for their part in the extraordinary growth of the Tea Party movement .
The two , 74-year-old Charles and David , 70 , have invested widely in the outcome of the 2 November elections .
One Koch subsidiary has pumped $ 1m into the campaign to repeal California 's global warming law , according to state records .
The brothers , their wives and employees have also given directly to Republican candidates for Congress and are the sixth-largest donors to the Senate campaign of Tea Party favourite Marco Rubio .
They have also given heavily to the Republican Jim DeMint in South Carolina , according to the Centre for Responsive Politics .
But organisations tracking money in politics say the Kochs ' biggest impact in the midterm elections will be from funding and providing logistical support to such groups as Americans for Prosperity ( AFP ) , one of the biggest Tea Party groups .
AFP , in turn , has spun off other organisations such as November is Coming , Hands Off My Healthcare , and the Institute of Liberty , which are buying up television ads and holding rallies across the country in an attempt to defeat Democrats .
US campaign laws make it easy for political interest groups and their corporate backers to hide their spending in elections . `` This is a world of shadows , '' said Taki Oldham , an Australian documentary maker who spent months following Tea Party activists . `` In my mind , without a doubt nobody has had more influence on the anti-Obama campaign than the Koch-funded groups . ''
For the Kochs , who inherited their politics as well as their business from their father , Fred , this has been a long and carefully cultivated project .
But after years in which their support for anti-regulation thinktanks and groups went largely undetected , the sudden visibility of the Kochs ' power seems to have taken even the brothers by surprise .
`` Five years ago , my brothers Charles and I provided the funds to start Americans for Prosperity , '' David Koch told AFP 's annual Defending the Dream gathering in 2009 . `` It is beyond my wildest dreams that AFP has grown into this enormous organisation . The American dream of free enterprise and capitalism is alive and well . ''
Until last summer , most Americans had no idea who the Koch brothers were , and it is very likely that even AFP members did not know they were bankrolled by one of the richest men in corporate America .
But a spate of attention – sparked by a Greenpeace investigation and a profile in the New Yorker – has given the Kochs a degree of notoriety they are finding it difficult to live with .
When the Guardian stopped into the offices of the Charles G Koch charitable foundation , in the suburbs of Washington DC , the receptionist sent the head of the legal department out to talk .
After declaring all conversations off the record , lawyer Brian Menkes said it was normal for the Koch legal team to be involved in routine press inquiries .
`` Go to any company in the world and the legal department is involved in media inquiries , '' they said . `` It is standard operating procedure . ''
For their part , David Koch now seeks to distance themselves from the Tea Party . In a rare interview in New York magazine , they said : `` I 've never been to a Tea Party event . No one representing the Tea Party has ever even approached me . ''
The extreme sensitivity carries across to the company website , where recent additions tout the brothers ' commitment to environmental protections and offer a selection of `` Koch facts '' , an antidote to the unflattering personal and political portraits of the two that have appeared recently .
`` This is the outing of the Koch brothers . They did n't want this story told , especially in an election year , '' said Kert Davies , the research director for Greenpeace who has spent a decade gathering data on the family . `` They have never been face forward . ''
But they do have deep pockets . Koch Industries has expanded from oil refinery to paper towels and Lycra .
The two brothers each own 42 % of the company and occupy top-10 positions in the Forbes annual ranking of wealthy Americans , with personal fortunes of $ 21bn each .
Over the last 20 years , Koch Industries has donated at least $ 5.9m to political candidates , some 83 % of which was set aside for Republican candidates , according to the Centre for Responsive Politics .
Since 1989 , Koch Industries has spent more than any other oil and gas company on finding favour in Congress , paying $ 50m to lobbying firms .
But it is the Kochs ' links to a welter of mass mobilisation campaigns opposing Barack Obama that is making the biggest impact . Political monitoring organisations say the Koch-connected Claude R Lambe Charitable Foundation has given $ 3.1m to Americans for Prosperity .
The Kochs ' involvement in anti-government causes goes back to their father , who was a founding member of the virulently anti-communist John Birch Society .
They made their fortune by developing a more efficient refining method and built plants around the world , including 15 in the Soviet Union at the height of Stalin 's purges in the early 1930s . They came to despise Stalin and , David Koch told the New Yorker , was `` paranoid about communism , let 's put it that way '' .
They worked hard to instil the same beliefs in their four sons . Two of those sons later became estranged from the family , and were eventually bought out of Koch Industries , but for Charles and David , the rightwing free market ideology was their lodestar .
As the CEO of Koch Industries , Charles Koch began supporting free-market thinkers while honing their own ideas in a book called the Science of Liberty .
The brothers did try direct action . In 1980 , David Koch ran as a vice-presidential candidate on the libertarian ticket , winning just 1 % of the vote .
The episode , Charles Koch has written , persuaded the brothers to refocus their energies . In the 1980s , they founded Citzens for a Sound Economy .
Over the next 20 years , they funnelled around $ 13m to Citizens for a Sound Economy . In 2004 , the organisation split into Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks , which is closely tied to the former Republican Congressman Dick Armey and has received no more funding from the Koch family .
Obama 's election , and the prospect that the new president would reverse nearly two decades of reduced government oversight of industry , put the Kochs and their footsoldiers in Americans for Prosperity on high alert .
`` They were very afraid of the Obama administration and a return to a pro-regulatory environment after the Bush years , and probably ramped it up a bit to make sure nothing new was going to inhibit their business , '' Davies said .
A day after CNBC 's Rick Santelli launched their on-air howl against Obama 's mortgage bailout plan , AFP and Freedom Works put up Facebook pages and began organising events around the country . The Tea Party was under way .
• This article was amended on Thursday 21 October 2010 . We said that there was no sign of David Koch at the Defending the Dream convention this year , but they did in fact attend the gathering , where they presented an award . This has been corrected .
Credit Cards Are Great , But Bitcoin Is The Future
Sam Alter Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 26 , 2015
Credit cards are incredible . Over the last 50 years , they have become synonymous with payments , commerce , and general spending . They provide an incredibly simple way to purchase goods and services , whether it 's online , in store , or while I 'm travelling . Credit cards give me assurance that I 'm not going to be scammed , and if I am , the credit card company will fight on my behalf . They also allow me to accrue reward points that I can redeem for travel , accommodation , TV 's , gift cards , and more .
Who pays for the services they 're providing ? You do .
Every time you swipe your card , the merchant pays between 1 % — 5 % in fees , depending on the card you use , the value of the purchase , and numerous other factors . These fees are bundled into the price of the product , and the consumer ends up paying more for everyday items .
Companies like Stripe , PayPal , and Square ( to name a few ) have become very successful businesses by simplifying these charges and making it very easy to accept payments . Most of these companies , and many payment gateways , are now moving towards adding bitcoin payment options to their platforms .
Why ?
Because Bitcoin does n't cost them as much , they do n't have to deal with fraud , they do n't have to deal with chargebacks , and they do n't have to deal with outdated banking systems .
Bitcoin is a completely new way to imagine money and the international transfer of goods and services for the modern global economy .
Bitcoin allows merchants to accept payments directly from a consumer — similar to cash , but digitalized — with more security , anonymity , and ease than cash transactions . Bitcoin ca n't be forged like checks , nor counterfeited like bills , nor hacked like credit card databases . Bitcoin allows you to store assets digitally , on a public ledger ( known as the blockchain ) , and lets you transact directly with users and merchants around the world . Using a bitcoin wallet , you 're able to easily buy and sell bitcoin , open an app on your phone , and pay for things in person or online by scanning QR codes to send your bitcoin payment . Within seconds you can see the transaction go through , and you 're on your way .
Here at Snapcard , we 're simplifying the process for both users and merchants . We 've built an incredibly robust merchant API to seamlessly and easily enable payment processors , online stores , and brick-and-mortars to accept bitcoin payments , as well as a bitcoin wallet that lets you instantly buy bitcoin using your debit , credit , or checking account . The funds can be accessed online or through their iOS app , and their attention to detail in design and functionality makes the process as easy and simple as possible for new users .
Bitcoin is a new payment method that 's dramatically different from anything we 've seen in the history of money . It allows for seamless transactions around the world as an international currency , without the need for 50-year-old payment networks and banking relationships capitalizing on merchants and consumers . Hopefully Snapcard can make it easier for merchants , users , and processors to start using this amazing new technology !
Have any questions , or just want to discuss bitcoin ?

DOJ Flips Out That Evidence Gathered Via FISA Orders Might Be Made Available To Defendants
from the of-course-they-do dept
While this Court is mindful of the fact that no court has ever allowed disclosure of FISA materials to the defense , in this case , the Court finds that the disclosure may be necessary . This finding is not made lightly , and follows a thorough and careful review of the FISA application and related materials . The Court finds however that an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance is best made in this case as part of an adversarial proceeding . The adversarial process is the bedrock of effective assistance of counsel protected by the Sixth Amendment .... Indeed , though this Court is capable of making such a determination , the adversarial process is integral to safeguarding the rights of all citizens , including those charged with a crime . “ The right to the effective assistance of counsel is thus the right of the accused to require the prosecution 's case to survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing . ”
But a court 's preference for the adversarial process—a circumstance that exists in all litigation— can not serve as a basis for declaring that disclosure of FISA materials is “ necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance ” under the statute . Congress envisioned that FISA litigation be handled ex parte , in camera , with disclosure the rare exception .... Yet the district court 's reasoning would turn that regime on its head . A court could always say that an adversarial proceeding would be the “ best ” way to determine the legality of the FISA collection . To compel disclosure on that basis would trivialize FISA 's necessity standard and work a sea change in FISA litigation .
The district court also misjudged the damage to national security that could result from disclosing the FISA applications and orders , even to cleared defense counsel under a protective order , as substantiated by declarations from the Attorney General of the United States and the Acting Assistant Director of the FBI for Counterterrorism . A “ need-to-know ” must exist before classified information may be disclosed , even to those who possess a security clearance , and that essential prerequisite is present only where disclosure to defense counsel is “ necessary ” for a court to adjudicate the legality of the FISA collection .
When viewed under the correct “ necessity ” standard , nothing about the challenged FISA collection justifies the district court 's outlier decision . As the classified record makes clear , the ex parte process that the statute provides readily permits an accurate determination that the FISA collection was lawful , and the defendant 's allegations to the contrary are unfounded . A court reviewing the applications would have no difficulty determining that they established probable cause to believe the target was an agent of a foreign power and that a significant purpose of the collection was to obtain foreign intelligence information .
Last summer , we wrote about the case of Adel Daoud , an American teenager who was caught in one of the FBI 's home grown plots . Even before the whole Snowden situation broke , late in 2012 when the Senate was `` debating '' ( and I use that term loosely ) the renewal of the FISA Amendments Act ( which created Section 702 , the key piece of the PRISM program ) , Senator Dianne Feinstein strongly fought for the renewal ... using Daoud 's case as an example of where Section 702 was a key component in stopping terrorism -- saying that it was necessary in `` a plot to bomb a downtown Chicago bar . '' That describes the Daoud case , if by `` plot '' you mean Daoud and a bunch of undercover FBI agents creating a plan that was never actually going to happen.Feinstein 's admission that the FISA Amendments Act was used in the Daoud case took their lawyers by surprise , since none of the evidence they 'd been shown involved that . Their lawyers then asked for access to the evidence that was obtained via the FAA . After the Snowden revelations ( including how information obtained via FISA is often `` laundered '' to various law enforcement agencies to keep it out of court ) , their lawyers got even more aggressive . While their initial shot failed , in January , Judge Sharon Coleman decided that , assuming ( as claimed ) Daoud 's lawyer had security clearance , they should be able to see the FISA related materials . As they noted : It wo n't take a psychic to guess what happened next . A few days ago , the DOJ appealed this order explaining a theoretical parade of horrors that might happen if a lawyer with security clearance were given access to the evidence against their client.Right . How dare anyone think that it might be reasonable or sensible for courts to make sure that lawyers representing clients who were involved in plots created by the FBI actually get to see the secret evidence that the FBI got via a FISA court order ? Why , might break out ! And we 're the US government . Ca n't have that ! Furthermore , the DOJ is positive that the courts simply do n't understand the security issues , and the judge should n't worry about such things , because the smart people in the executive branch can decide for themselves which classified surveillance efforts are appropriate to reveal : This all seems ... completely bogus . But what makes itis that after it came out that the Solicitor General , Donald Verrilli made false statements to the Supreme Court about whether or not defendants in such cases would be told about evidence collected via the FISA process , the DOJ promised that it would start letting defendants know when the FISA process was used in the investigation . Yet , what the DOJ 's response here shows , is that even when that 's the case , the DOJ will doto keep the details of what was done via FISA ( and whether or not it was legal or appropriate ) out of the case .

OLYMPIA , Wash. ( AP ) - Gov . Jay Inslee and a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a plan on Tuesday that would make changes to the state 's impaired driving laws , including requiring an arrest on the first offense and mandatory jail time if offenders do n't enroll in a sobriety program after a second arrest .
The measure also would prohibit people from purchasing alcohol for 10 years after a third conviction on drunken driving , and it would require mandatory installment of interlock devices on cars after someone is charged , rather than convicted , unless an exception is made by a court .
Inslee called the plan the `` most aggressive , the most effective , the most ambitious program to reduce drunk driving on our roads . ''
`` It is the right thing to do , '' they said at a news conference , joined by several lawmakers involved with the bill . `` If an offender can not or will not modify their substance abuse , we will stop them from driving an automobile on the streets of the state of Washington , '' Inslee said .
The proposal sets mandatory minimum jail times for second and third offenses , but offenders can avoid jail on the second offense if they enroll in a substance abuse program that requires them to take frequent breathalyzer tests . The program is modeled on one in South Dakota . On a third offense , they would be sentenced to 364 days in jail and issued an identification card that would prohibit them from purchasing alcohol for a decade .
A joint hearing on the Senate and House version of the bills is set to be held Thursday morning .
Inslee said the costs of the measure have n't yet been determined , but that they are `` not insignificant . ''
`` This is an effective program , and if you 're going to have an effective program , there 's going to be some costs associated with it , '' they said .
The legislation comes in the wake of two recent fatal accidents .
Last month , a suspected drunken driver slammed into a family crossing the street in a residential Seattle neighborhood , a crash that critically injured a 10-day-old child and their mother and killed their grandparents .
Mark Mullan , 50 , was ordered held on $ 2.5 million bail after pleading not guilty last week to charges of vehicular homicide and assault . Mullan , who had prior DUI arrests , was driving on a suspended license at the time of the crash , and was supposed to have an interlock device on their truck , but did not .
Earlier this month , a Seattle woman was killed in a crash with a wrong-way driver on Highway 520 near the University of Washington . Michael A. Robertson , 25 , has been charged with vehicular homicide and ordered held on $ 1 million bail .
`` The victims do n't have a chance , they do n't have a second chance , '' said Rep. Roger Goodman , D-Kirkland . `` So why are we giving the drunk drivers a second chance to kill ? We need tougher laws . ''
According to the Washington State Patrol , there are about 40,000 DUI arrests a year , half made by the patrol , the other half by local law enforcement .
In 2011 , the most recent data available , there were 454 traffic accident fatalities , 199 of which a driver was impaired by either drugs or alcohol , they said . Of that 199 , 135 were impaired by alcohol only . In 2007 , of 571 total traffic fatalities , 272 involved people who were impaired while driving .
`` We do n't want to see any fatalities in this state due to drunk driving , '' said Republican Sen. Mike Padden of Spokane Valley , the sponsor of one of the bills .

RALEIGH , N.C. ( AP ) — North Carolina is joining a growing number of states exploring new fees for hybrid and electric car owners to help make up for revenue those drivers are n't paying in gas taxes on their fuel-efficient vehicles .
The proposal strikes many owners of alternative-fuel vehicles and some advocacy groups as a wrong-headed approach to balancing priorities of promoting U.S. energy independence with sustainable infrastructure funding . But policymakers and some experts argue taxing hybrid and electric vehicle owners is a matter of making sure all drivers help maintain the roads they use and construct new ones .
Gas taxes are the most vital source of transportation funding , making up nearly 40 percent of all state highway revenues and more than 90 percent at the federal level , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . But those revenues have n't kept up with rising construction costs , falling 41 percent in real value at the federal level since they were last increased 18 years ago , according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy . The same non-partisan research group estimates that state and local gas-tax revenue fell 7 percent to $ 38 billion between 2004 and 2010 .

Many transportation organizations and other groups say an overhaul that moves the system to a tax based on miles traveled is needed , but those reforms come with their own hurdles and for now states are looking for other fixes . At least 10 states are considering or have passed legislation to collect fees from owners of electric or hybrid cars .
“ I think so far what we 're seeing is the trend seems to be either an additional annual fee or some type of registration fee seems to be much more popular than the miles-driven tax , because that is a newer technology and raises some privacy concerns , ” said Kristy Hartman , a transportation and environment analyst at the NCSL .
New Jersey scrapped a plan to charge vehicles by miles traveled amid pushback from media and legislators , opting instead for a flat fee on electric cars .
North Carolina senators included an additional $ 100 annual registration fee for electric-car owners and a $ 50 fee for hybrid drivers . They estimate the new fees will raise $ 1.5 million annually . The Senate 's provision would have to survive budget negotiations with the House , which is expected to release its full spending plan in the coming days .
Sen. Neal Hunt , R-Wake and a chief budget-writer , argues the policy ensures all drivers are contributing their fair share toward maintaining the roads and services they all use .
“ I just seems logical to me that they should pay a small fee for the use of the highways and the wear and tear they put on the highways , ” they said .
But that policy , along with the end of a pilot program offering four interstate plug-in stops , is troubling to many drivers of fuel-efficient cars .
Heavy traffic : $ 225 million would go to oil-impacted county roads
Ryan Turner , an IT professional in Chapel Hill , said they and many other drivers of alternative-fuel vehicles chose their cars because they 're concerned about the environment and the country 's dependence on oil . The Chevrolet Volt driver helped advocate for a statewide plug-in vehicle readiness plan .
“ On its face , it 's reasonable for electric owners to contribute toward road tax in some way , ” they said . “ I think what 's suspect is that , given all the issues we have in this state , given the state 's woeful effort so far to promote electric vehicles as part of some statewide agenda , it is suspect that this vehicle tax is a priority given the small amount of the revenue it will bring in . ”
The policy looks especially arbitrary when more and more conventional cars are achieving fuel efficiency that 's comparable to some hybrid cars , Turner added .
Jay Friedland , legislative director for the advocacy group Plug In America , has asked legislators in other states to phase in special fees after the number of alternative-fuel vehicles reaches 100,000 , arguing administrative costs make such policies counter-productive before states reach a critical mass .
“ We generally say this is a period of time when you should be incentivizing these vehicles , but after a while , yes , everyone should be paying their fair share , ” they said .

North Carolina has an estimated 30,000 hybrid and electric cars registered in the state .
Plug In America supports a vehicle-miles tax , and Friedland said their organization swayed Washington lawmakers to include a study of that policy in the state 's own bill targeting alternative-fuel vehicles .
“ Fundamentally , the mechanism exists ( for charging a miles-traveled tax ) , but I do n't know of any states that are currently doing that yet , ” they said . “ We 're really on the edge of this , because we 're for once actually watching fuel consumption going down , and that 's why we 're watching these taxes come up . ”
Berry Jenkins of the Carolinas Association of General Contractors said bigger reforms are ultimately needed to address infrastructure in the long term . He 's part of a coalition of businesses and regional transit groups that endorses miles-traveled taxes . The problem , they said , are concerns that they system would require intrusive new technologies and that fuels apprehension among political leaders .
“ It 's never going to be a convenient time to ask people to pay more for infrastructure , ” they said .

The 22-year old returns to the Sky Blues until January and adds valuable option in midfield ...
Coventry City have signed Newcastle United midfielder Gael Bigirimana on a emergency loan deal until January 3rd .
The Sky Blues have snapped up the 22-year old to add depth to the midfield as the former City Academy graduate returns to the club .
Bigirimana began their career at the club 's Academy and signed their first professional deal with the club in June 2011 , making their professional debut on the opening day of the 2011/12 season against Leicester City .
'Bigi ' impressed during the 2011/12 campaign , making 26 league appearances and Premier League side Newcastle United signed them for an undisclosed fee in July 2012 .
They have since made 13 appearances for the Magpies , scoring one goal and has also spent time on loan with Scottish Championship side Rangers .
City boss Tony Mowbray said : `` I 'm looking forward to working with Gael and I 'm sure he 'll add a valuable option to our midfield .
`` We 're coming into a busy period in the season so it is important we do n't get caught short with injuries and suspensions , and Gael will help us with that .
`` A lot of people at the club have only had good things to say about Gael and I 'm sure they are looking forward to coming back and making a positive impression on us . ''
Perfectionism is slowly killing me inside . My psychologist refers to the phenomenon as ‘ unrelenting standards ' , which means that I set a standard for myself that can never actually be attained . These standards also do not apply to other people in my eyes . This covers all aspects of my life , from relationships to academic achievements . I could view perfectionism as a positive , other than the fact that I experience constant stress and anxiety because of it . I have quit so many things that I have started , from university courses , to online travel writing courses . I quit them because I felt like I was n't good enough and was going to fail . I preferred to quit early rather than discover just how incapable I may have been .
Anxiety surrounding perfectionism started early in my childhood . I remember at age ten pretending that I was sick one day so that I did n't have to go to school . This was after I realised that I had completed a long division assignment incorrectly . I was so terrified of being perceived as stupid or incapable that I refused to go to school to receive my marks . I have always felt like it is expected of me to perform well and be a high achiever .
This perfectionism permeates every aspect of my life .
Academic achievements .
I expect myself to attain at least a Distinction ( 75 % ) in university assignments . For me , that is the equivalent to passing ; it is my expected standard . I do n't celebrate getting high marks , I simply see it as expected of me . I once attained a mark of 66 % on an essay and cried uncontrollably for an hour . I felt like an absolute failure . It is so important to me to be a high achiever and , in some way , prove to myself and others that I am intelligent and capable .
This academic perfectionism began in primary school , as I described earlier . I have always felt like my intelligence is my most important and most defining trait . I think that it stems from two places . Firstly , I grew up knowing that I was unattractive and socially anxious . This made me feel like intelligence was the only outwardly desirable trait that I had . Secondly , I was always praised as a child for being intelligent and gifted , which reinforced the message that it was important to be these things . I internalised this message and have fixated on it ever since .
I still feel like something of a failure today because I have to study part-time . Every time I try to study full-time like everyone else I know , I dissolve into a puddle of depression and anxiety by the end of the semester . I become non-functional from the amount of stress that my body is experiencing at any given time . Even though I know that I need to adjust the way that I attend university because of my mental illnesses , I still beat myself up over not being able to be perfect .
Relationships .
I have always felt like I need to be a perfect girlfriend , whatever that means . This is amplified by the intense fear of abandonment that I experience because of my borderline personality disorder . I worry that if I am not perfect , then no one will ever truly love me . For me , this means avoiding being clingy , jealous , and overly emotional . This is literally impossible to avoid , especially when I live with a personality disorder that makes me experience intense emotions most of the time . I also stress that if I am not sexually available when my partner is , they will become bored with me and find someone else . I rationally know that it is impossible to be perfect within a relationship , and would never expect it of a partner , but emotionally I feel panicky that I just do n't measure up .
Needing to be “ successful ” .
Since my early teens , I have felt the urgent drive to be successful . When I was younger , I was obsessed with the idea of being a published author at a young age . That never happened . I become fixated on young entrepreneurs and people who are succeeding at younger ages than I am . I know that I am only 22 , but I see people years younger than me graduating from university , buying houses , owning fancy cars , and getting adult jobs . It is confusing me for me because I do n't desire financial success , but I still feel like I am falling behind everyone else of my age . It is really important to me to make a positive difference in the world , and to create things through my writing that resonate strongly with other people .
The most confusing part about my perfectionism is that I give advice to others that I do n't follow myself . I tell all of my friends to take life at their own pace , try out new experiences , and not stress about the end goal of a degree or a rewarding career . However , when I think about my future , I panic . I feel like I am spiralling out of control , and I am petrified that I will live a mediocre , meaningless life . I wish that I could believe in my own advice .
Enjoying my youth .
My perfectionism is completely contradictory . On the one hand , I want to be a responsible adult who is moving towards a successful future . On the other hand , I am terrified of the idea that I am wasting my youth . I stress that I should be focusing more on socialising , having fun , and being carefree , while I still have the ability to do so . This is also influenced by my highly impulsive nature , which is a part of my borderline personality disorder . I deal with this fear by travelling as much as possible and focusing my energy on saving money for future travel . My rational brain knows that it wants to focus on the long-term plan and having a happy and fulfilling life . I do n't want to waste my time partying , but I ca n't shut down the voice in my brain that says I am boring and wasting my prime years .
Physical appearance .
As I discussed in this post , my physical appearance is a source of great anxiety . I worry that if I do n't look perfect , then my boyfriend will lose interest in me and want to find someone else . I worry that other people will notice imperfections with my appearance and judge me harshly . Before I went through puberty , I considered myself to be extremely unattractive , and I never fully grew out of that mindset . Despite my appearance changing significantly , I still feel like the short , flat-chested , acne-ridden girl that I used to be . It is hard to shake away perceptions that you have had of yourself for so many years . Any imperfection in my appearance causes significant stress and anxiety . I try to remind myself that literally no one looks perfect , but it is difficult to listen to a voice of reason .
Mental health .
My various mental illnesses are a source of great personal shame . I hate that I have borderline personality disorder . I hate that I live with chronic depression and daily anxiety . It makes me feel weak and unlovable . I feel like a failure because I have had three years of therapy and I still do n't always implement my coping strategies . I hate that I relapse several times a year and seem to take one step back for every step forwards . This attitude of perfectionism towards my mental health is so harmful , because I emotionally punish myself for things that I have little control over . I would never perceive my mentally ill friends in this way , but I often see myself as a failure .
So what now ?
I know that my perfectionism is deeply unhealthy and ruining my quality of life . I know that I am far too hard on myself and that no one could ever be as perfect as I try to force myself to be . My psychologist encourages that I practise radical self-acceptance . It involves treating my characteristics as true neutral . They are neither bad nor good , just the way that I am . I try to implement this self-acceptance in my everyday life , but it feels like an uphill battle . I will probably never fully let go of my perfectionism , but I am slowly working towards having more reasonable expectations for myself . I hope that one day I will get there .
TEHRAN , Iran -- An Iranian court sentenced the founder of one of the first Farsi-language blogs , credited with sparking the boom in Iranian reform bloggers , to more than 19 years in prison for their writings , a news web site reported Tuesday .
Iranian-Canadian Hossein Derakhshan , 35 , was a controversial figure among Iran 's blogging community . Writing their blog from Canada , they were initially a critic of Iran 's clerical leadership , and in 2006 they visited Israel -- Iran 's archenemy -- saying they wanted to act as a bridge between the two countries ' peoples .
But they later became a vocal supporter of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , praising them for standing up to the West and criticizing regime opponents . Derakhshan then visited Iran in 2008 and was arrested . Over the next two years , they were often held without communication with family or lawyers , according to rights groups .
Mashreghnews.ir , which is close to Iran 's presidential office , reported on Tuesday that Derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries -- a reference to the Israel visit -- spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment , promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting Islamic thought and religious figures .
The court sentenced them to 19 1/2 years in prison , the report said , adding that Derakhshan can appeal . It was unclear if they would benefit from time served .
Derakhshan helped ignite blogging in Iran by posting simple instructions online on how to create sites in Farsi in 2001 . The flourishing of blogs by Iranians at home and abroad that resulted gave the country 's reform movement an online platform that has helped it survive heavy crackdowns at home -- though authorities tried to block many , including Derakhshan 's .
Their later embrace of Ahmadinejad angered many reform bloggers . Before returning to Iran , Derakhshan on their blog dismissed worries they could be arrested for their previous writings .
The Iranian government has stepped up its crackdown on opponents since Ahmadinejad 's 2009 re-election , which opponents say they won by fraud , a claim the president denies .
Authorities shut down two pro-reform newspapers -- Andisheh-e No daily and Bahar Zanjan -- for publishing articles in which they had insulted officials , another newspaper , Shargh , reported Tuesday . They were the latest in a string of newspapers to be banned since the election .
USDA , Minnesota agree to provide $ 220K for wolf control
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state of Minnesota have agreed on a plan to provide $ 220,000 to control gray wolves that prey on livestock .
The announcement came Wednesday from U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson . The Minnesota Democrat calls it welcome news for farmers and ranchers who have n't been allowed to shoot or trap wolves that threaten their livestock since a federal judge in December put wolves in Minnesota , Wisconsin and Michigan back on the endangered list .
Under the agreement , the USDA and state will each provide $ 110,000 to fund wolf damage management work through Sept. 30 .
Peterson says he 'll continue working to return wolf management in Minnesota , Wisconsin and Michigan back to the states .
The U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service , Wisconsin and Michigan plan to appeal the court ruling .

There 's an online calculator called MODTRAN that calculates the absorption of longwave ( “ greenhouse ” ) radiation for various greenhouse gases ( “ GHGs ” ) , and shows their resulting effect . It does this on a “ line-by-line ” basis , meaning it examines each interval of the longwave spectrum for each greenhouse gas at each altitude , and calculates the resulting absorption by each species given the concentration and the partial pressure of that species . Figure 1 shows the calculation results for the default values of CO2 , ozone , and methane .
Figure 1 . MODTRAN results . The jagged red line at the top right shows what is not absorbed by the atmosphere . Colored lines in the background are theoretical “ no-absorption ” curves for various temperatures . The big “ bite ” out of the middle section of the jagged red line is mainly water vapor absorption , although it overlaps with the CO2 absorption bands in parts of it . The graph at the lower right shows the pressure , temperature , and the concentration of H20 , Ozone , CO2 , and CH4 at various elevations . The number “ Iout ” is the total energy that is not absorbed , so as absorption increases , that number will decrease .
That all seems straightforward , it looks the same as in heaps of textbooks … so where 's the MODTRAN oddity ?
The oddity arose as a result of my wanting to know more about the doubling of CO2 , and the 3.7 watts per square metre of increased absorption that IPCC claims the aforesaid doubling of CO2 is supposed to cause . To find out what MODTRAN says , I put in 750 ppm of CO2 in the top cell , and I had MODTRAN recalculate the Iout . To my surprise , I found that it was 284.672 … which when subtracted from the starting Iout shown above of 287.844 gives us only 3.2 watts per square metre increased absorption ( forcing change ) for a doubling of CO2 .
I had left the “ No Clouds or Rain ” choice selected , thinking that the biggest change in CO2 would be in clear-sky conditions . So I figured “ well , perhaps clouds or rain increase the absorption when CO2 doubles ” … but investigating various cloud results showed that was not the case , they all gave smaller absorption changes . My original intuition was correct , clear-sky conditions give the biggest change in absorption for a doubling of CO2 .
So I thought , “ well , perhaps I 'm looking at the wrong region of the Earth ” . The other latitude bands available in MODTRAN are Midlatitude Summer and Winter , and Subarctic Summer and Winter . I took nominal CO2 values to represent the CO2 concentration in 1850 ( 285 ppmv ) , default ( 375 ppmv ) , doubling of 1850 value ( 570 ppmv ) and doubling of the present value ( 750 ppmv ) . I figured that would give me two doublings , and let me see if the increases were linear with the logarithm of the number of doublings . I used MODTRAN to calculate the absorption change in each latitude band . Figure 2 shows those results , with the X axis being the number of doublings , and the Y-axis showing the increase in longwave absorption .
Figure 2 . MODTRAN and IPCC values for the increase in forcing due to increasing CO2 . The forcing change in each region per doubling of CO2 in watts per square metre is shown after the name in the legend , followed by “ T= ” and the surface temperature .
First thing I noticed is that the lines are all straight . So MODTRAN does indeed show a linear relationship between logarithm of the CO2 increase and the calculated increase in absorption . So no surprise there .
What was a surprise is that none of the other latitude bands had larger changes in absorption than the tropics . I 'd thought that since the IPCC says the global average change from doubling CO2 is 3.7 W/m2 , that because the tropics were at 3.2 W/m2 , somewhere else the absorption must be above 3.7 W/m2 to make the average correct . But that 's not the case . They 're all smaller .
I also thought that the difference in absorption might be due to the different surface temperatures … but Midlatitude Winter and Subarctic Summer have about the same calculated absorption , yet their surface temperatures are about 15 degrees apart .
Note that what I have shown , the change in absorption , is also called the “ instantaneous ” forcing , abbreviated Fi . There are various other forcings one can measure . Hansen discusses them here ( PDF ) , and gives a value of 4.52 W/m2 for the instantaneous forcing from a doubling of CO2 according to their climate model ( Table 1 , p. 7 ) . Presumably their model does a line-by-line calculation similar to MODTRAN to figure out the absorption changes .
The IPCC , on the other hand , says :
The simple formulae for RF [ radiative forcing ] of the LLGHG [ long-lived greenhouse gases ] quoted in Ramaswamy et al . ( 2001 ) are still valid . These formulae are based on global RF calculations where clouds , stratospheric adjustment and solar absorption are included , and give an RF of +3.7 W m–2 for a doubling in the CO2 mixing ratio . SOURCE : IPCC AR4 WG1 ( PDF ) page 140
So it appears the IPCC result is not based on a line by line calculation …
And that 's the MODTRAN oddity . Here 's the question :
1 . Why does the MODTRAN calculated line-by-line change in absorption range from a low of 1.7 W/m2 to a high of 3.2 W/m2 , while Hansen is saying the answer is really 4.5 W/m2 and the IPCC uses 3.7 W/m2 ?
Since according to MODTRAN ( and logic ) clouds reduce the effect of a doubling of CO2 , and the IPCC ( and presumably Hansen ) are using all-sky conditions , that makes the IPCC/Hansen figures even farther from the MODTRAN figures .
Please note that ( per Hansen ) the instantaneous forcing Fi is greater than the adjusted forcing Fa by about 0.4 W/m2 . The IPCC is saying that the 3.7 W/m2 is the adjusted forcing Fa , the forcing after the stratosphere adjusts to the change . So their value for instantaneous forcing would be larger , removing the stratospheric adjustment would put it at about 4.1 W/m2 . So the IPCC is closer to Hansen 's value for the instantaneous forcing … but it means they 're further from the MODTRAN calculations .
I do n't know what I 'm missing here , and I do n't understand these results , so any assistance gladly accepted .

Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake bypassed the City Council on Thursday to approve a proposal allowing the city to sell four downtown , city-owned garages to raise up to $ 60 million for recreation centers .
The plan — which clears the way for the city to begin negotiating with companies to buy the garages — was unanimously approved Thursday night by the Off-Street Parking Commission , a six-member panel of mayoral appointees that had n't met since 2007 .
The proposal had previously stalled for two years in a council committee , blocked by City Council President Bernard C. `` Jack '' Young , who has argued that the garages are generating revenue for the city and should n't be sold .
Rawlings-Blake will leave office before the garages can be sold . Mayor-elect Catherine Pugh , who takes office Dec. 6 , would make the final decision on any deal and how any money is spent .
The mayor appointed to the commission Steve Sharkey , director of general services ; Paul Graziano , director of the Housing Authority of Baltimore City ; Tom Stosur , director of planning ; Henry Raymond , director of finance ; Frank Murphy , acting director of transportation ; and Andrew Smullian , deputy mayor for government relations and labor .
Their vote followed more than an hour of presentations on the merits of selling the garages by Peter Little , executive director of the Parking Authority of Baltimore City , and other city officials .
The city received unsolicited offers for the garages — located at 11 S. Eutaw St. , 22 S. Gay St. , 101 S. Paca St. and 210 St. Paul Place — a decade ago , when they were n't profitable , Little said . After significant improvements , they are performing at a market rate and generating $ 2.8 million a year in net income after debt servicing and capital expenses , they said .
The value of the sale , Little added , exceeds the appraised value of maintaining city ownership .
The sale , which officials project would net roughly $ 60.3 million , would assist the Parks and Recreation Department in building and maintaining $ 136 million in fitness and wellness centers , community centers , outdoor athletic centers and pools across the city , according to acting Parks and Recreation director William Vondrasek .
The City Council did not put a representative on the committee . City Councilman Brandon Scott , who spoke briefly before the vote , told the agency heads that , whatever happens , they will press for a positive outcome for youths .
`` There 's no issue in the city that 's more important to me than modernizing and adding better rec centers , '' Scott said .
Lester Davis , a spokesperson for Young , said after the vote that the council president is looking forward to discussing next steps with Pugh .
`` The two of them ... are going to sit down together and figure out a way forward , '' they said .
Pugh has said they will have their economic development team study the `` feasibility '' of selling the garages .
`` We 'll do a careful evaluation of the whole entire thing , '' they said Thursday night .

Vladimir Putin will not be coming to the London Olympics , diplomatic sources have said , in an apparent signal of the Russian president 's continuing displeasure and irritation with Britain .
Putin will not attend the London 2012 opening ceremony on 27 July , sources confirmed , despite the fact that Moscow will host the Winter Olympics in 2014 in the Black Sea resort of Sochi . Instead , the Russian president is likely to dispatch their prime minister , Dmitry Medvedev , to London .
The snub follows Putin 's controversial decision earlier this month to boycott the G8 summit hosted by the US president , Barack Obama . Putin claimed they were too busy forming their new government to attend , and sent Medvedev instead . They have accused the US of inciting street protests against them and is unhappy with Washington 's missile defence plans in Europe .
Putin has a long list of grievances against Britain . As well as the unresolved Alexander Litvinenko affair – a source of smouldering tension – the Kremlin has been infuriated by calls to ban senior Russians accused of human rights abuses .
In March , a group of backbench MPs voted to refuse visas to officials implicated in the death of Sergei Magnitsky , a Russian lawyer who died in prison in 2009 . The Foreign Office has so far ignored the non-binding vote and ruled out a Magnitsky ban .
Putin was inaugurated for a third time as president on 7 May . Soon afterwards , they announced that one of Moscow 's top foreign policy priorities was to prevent government and other officials from being placed on visa blacklists abroad . Campaigners say visa bans are one of the few effective measures against bureaucrats who enjoy visiting London and other EU capitals and typically hold bank accounts in the west .
On Wednesday , Denis MacShane , the former Labour Europe minister , said they welcomed Putin 's decision to avoid the Games . Earlier this year , the MP said Downing Street should make it clear Putin was not welcome at the Olympics .
The threat of Magnitsky sanctions has received `` phenomenal coverage '' in the Russian press , they said , probably contributing to the decision to stay away . `` I think Putin does n't want to come to Britain and face difficult questions , '' they said .
They went on : `` This is further evidence of the turning inwards of Putin towards a more nationalistic authoritarianism and a rejection of western values . They do n't want to come to a democratic country and realise how unpopular they now are , because of their refusal to uphold the rule of law and justice back in Russia . ''
Putin attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing Games in August 2008 . At the time Putin was prime minister , having installed their protege Medvedev as president . The ceremony was dramatically overshadowed by events in Georgia , which came under Russian air and artillery bombardment after Georgian troops briefly seized back the rebel province of South Ossetia . Putin and Bush were seen having a heated conversation about who was to blame for the unfolding war .
Since David Cameron 's coalition government took over in 2010 there has been a modest improvement in bilateral relations , with foreign secretary William Hague – who was in Moscow on Monday – keen to promote bilateral trade . But Putin remains incensed about Britain 's refusal to extradite leading Kremlin critics based in London , including the fugitive oligarch Boris Berezovsky and the Chechen separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev .
There are also major differences on international affairs , with the west exasperated by Moscow 's stalwart support for Syria 's President Bashar al-Assad and its spoiling role at the UN security council . Russia , for its part , sees US and UK support for Syria 's rebels as part of a western-engineered plot to force regime change in Damascus .
Since returning to the Kremlin this month , Putin has kept a surprisingly low profile . There have been none of the stunts or photo opportunities that characterised their election campaign . Kremlin minders are apparently keen to avoid spontaneous – and potentially risky – encounters with ordinary Russians . Street protests in Moscow that began last December continue , with anti-Kremlin activists organising an Occupy-style camp and holding spontaneous mass walks .
Some 120 heads of state have said they will attend the London 2012 opening ceremony . It will be the largest top-level international gathering in diplomatic history , the Foreign Office believes .
The number far exceeds the 87 leaders who travelled to Beijing in 2008 . Several controversial leaders on an EU blacklist will also not be coming : they include Assad , Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe , and Belarus 's Alexander Lukashenko .
But other authoritarian rulers not on the list are likely to travel to London . They include Uzbekistan 's despotic leader , Islam Karimov , and their counterpart from Turkmenistan , Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov . Both visited the Beijing Olympics in 2008 .

TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - Coral reefs off the southeast coast of Taiwan have turned black with disease possibly due to sewage discharge , threatening fragile undersea ecosystems and tourism , a study released Friday said .
The discovery on a problem long suspected but seldom documented shows that coral is suffering widely in waters up to five meters ( 16.4 feet ) deep and 300 meters offshore from two outlying islands , said researcher Chen Chao-lun of Taiwan 's state-funded Academia Sinica .
“ This is a large distribution and we had no previous information , ” said Chen , whose began doing research with local environmental groups in 2007 . “ If you snorkel , you 'll see it 's black . If it 's all black , there wo n't be too many tourists . ”
Coral reefs , delicate undersea structures resembling rocky gardens made by tiny animals called coral polyps , are important nurseries and shelters for fish and other sea life .
They also protect coastlines , provide a critical source of food for millions of people and are potential storehouses of medicines .
Taiwan 's study did not pinpoint a cause for the diseased coral , but untreated sewage may a factor , Chen said .
On Green Island , a tourism hotspot and one the sites surrounded by diseased coral , garbage and excrement are dumped into the surrounding azure waters while reefs are often plundered by coral-robbing tourists , officials and long-time divers say .
The Taiwan researchers have sent their report to the government and plan to check for problems in other offshore areas known to support coral , Chen said .
Coral covers about 400,000 square km ( 154,000 sq miles ) of tropical ocean floor . The biggest is Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , a collection of 2,900 reefs along 2,100 km ( 1,300 miles ) of Australia 's northeast coast in a marine park the size of Germany .

A Mobike was discovered spray painted gold and fitted with new handlebars .
The pimped up bike , which is part of a fleet of cycles for hire being trialled in Manchester , was found left outside Withington police station , on Elizabeth Slinger Road on Tuesday .
A number of the cycles have been vandalised , broken or stolen but this appears to be the first time of the cycles has been customised .
( Image : David Dunnico )
It is understood a passer-by discovered a lock on the bike had been broken and left it outside the police station .
The incident was then reported to Mobike operators .
The cycle was no longer the distinctive grey and orange colour associated with Mobikes , but was painted gold .
It has also been fitted with riser style handlebars .
A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police said the incident was not reported to police .
Mobike has also been contacted by the M.E.N for a comment .
It is understood since the scheme was introduced last month more than 50 bikes have been vandalised .
The bike firm 's conditions of use state that users must not “ damage , deface , vandalise or tamper with the bicycle ” or “ add or attach accessories or trailers to the bicycle ” .
About
Why did I take this Project to Kickstarter ?
Even though I have made a prototype with my hobby CNC mill , in order to get the dice into your hands I need to commission a machine shop to make them for me in bulk with machines that have a higher feed rates and better CNC tools than my simple hobby mill . The added time and labor to machine this complex design adds to the price , as well as all the costs for the different materials that is being offered . In summary I need your help to purchase the raw materials and to have them professionally and precision machined .
Video of Dice in SolidWorks - Virtual Machining .
Videos of Floating Face Dice being Machined on CNC Mill .
Dice Details
I want to offer Lucky Dice 's - Floating Face Dice in four ( 4 ) different material types to start . They will be made from Aluminum , Stainless Steel , Brass and Copper .
6 Anodized Aluminum Colors , Stainless Steel , Brass , Copper
Each die will be precision machined from a solid piece of metal into 2 pieces . This will turn them into Floating Face dice . The middle of the die is loose and moves freely , but will not come out . Currently I am only offering them in the size of 3/4 '' or approximately 19 mm . The Aluminum dice will be milled down and shaped and then be anodized . That way the pips and the floating feature machined into each side will show off the bare aluminum and give a really good contrast to the anodized surface !
There will also be 2 different `` Floating '' styles that can be ordered and 2 Different `` Solid '' styles .
The first style has a simple fillet around all the edges and still maintains its square look . - I call these Floating Face Fillet
Floating Face Fillet Bare Aluminum
Floating Fillet Red Anodized
Floating Fillet Side View
The second style has rounded corners to give it a hybrid look between square and round . - I call these Floating Face Round
Floating Face Round Bare Aluminum
Floating Rounded Red Anodized
Top two rows shows Anodized Aluminum , Bottom Row - Stainless Steel , Brass , Copper
I am going to offer the above dice in SOLID forms as well .
I call these two Regular `` Solid '' Fillet and Regular `` Solid '' Rounded

What It Is : The long-rumored 2015 Dodge Challenger Hellcat being put through its paces under gloomy skies . Wearing but tiny strips of camo on its front and rear fascias , Chrysler apparently feels that , since the 2015 Challenger update was revealed at the New York auto show , cloaking measures are no longer required for the Hellcat 's nearly identical exterior .

Unfortunately for them , our savvy photogs caught one in the wild , immediately zeroing in on the Hellcat 's telltale center-mounted and front-facing air-intake scoop . Even better , they managed to snag a shot with the Challenger 's hood raised , exposing the massive supercharger that , for those of a certain age , will likely bring to mind the “ rat roaster ” aftermarket intakes favored by brave Challenger Hemi owners during the pony car 's first go-round some 40 years ago . Sure the technology is completely different ( with a distinct lack of carburetion ) , but evoking the past has been part of the modern Challenger 's appeal since day one . In addition to the Viper-esque hood scoop , it appears the Challenger Hellcat will pack the same revised front fascias , deep air dam , LED headlight halo , and taillamps as the rest of the Challenger lineup .

Why It Matters : The pony-car war is still on full boil , and Dodge needs to keep the Challenger interesting in the face of the redesigned 2015 Mustang and its forthcoming Shelby GT350 variant rumored to be packing a flat-plane “ Voodoo ” V-8 . And then there are the Camaro ZL-1 and the Z/28 . Bragging rights mean a lot in this segment , and if it takes forced induction to keep the Challenger relevant , you wont hear a whimper of complaint from us .
Platform : Nothing new here , the Challenger Hellcat is expected to soldier on with the same shortened LX platform as its siblings . We would n't be surprised if Chrysler tweaked spring rates , dampers and bushings for Hellcat duty , and the bright-red Brembo calipers seen in the images appear to be a tad more substantial than those in current use .

Powertrain : Initial rumors pegged the Hellcat 's numbers somewhere just north of 600 horsepower and with 575 lb-ft of torque , but recent remarks made by SRT chief Ralph Gilles insinuated that the final number may top the 640-hp output of the V-10–powered Viper . The current 6.4-liter Hemi generates 470 horsepower and 470 lb-ft , and pushing the horsepower number beyond 600 via forced induction is the easy part ; making it tractable and durable is where the work is done . [ UPDATE : We have confirmation that the supercharged engine will displace 6.2 liters . ] Reports are that the Hemi will back up to a ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic .

Competition : Chevrolet Camaro ZL-1 , Ford Mustang Shelby GT500
Estimated Arrival and Price : Our latest intel has the 2015 Dodge Challenger Hellcat arriving in the third quarter of 2014 as 2015 model . Pricing is up in the air , but with the current Challenger SRT8 ringing in with an MSRP just south of $ 47,000 , you can bet the Hellcat will be north of the $ 50K mark .
A majority of “ white America ” are descendants of people who came to America during the great waves of European immigration from 1880 to 1924 . Over a hundred million white Americans trace their ancestry to immigrants who passed through Ellis Island , which did n't open until 1900 . Most white Americans are descendants from people who came to these shores long after slavery was extinguished .
Black Lives Matter used the Fourth of July for its denigration of “ racist ” America . Accusations of American racism typically begin with references to the trans-Atlantic slave trade , although they do not end there . While the indictment is popular among those who disdain America , most people know less about the slave trade than the intensity of their contempt for America and white people would seem to indicate .
The indictment of all white people for the evil of slavery because they share skin color with slave owners is an indulgence in absurdity . We are told not to judge all Muslims as terrorists or all blacks responsible for the crimes of individual blacks . Yet , for whites , the collective guilt is unending . It is propagated in our universities under the now theological dictates of white privilege and white guilt .
The Eastern and Southern Europeans who came here primarily during the period of 1880-1924 had no participation in the slave trade except to have had some of their forbearers taken as slaves by Muslim slavers from North Africa and the Ottoman Empire . For over two hundred years , during the mid-1600s to the 1830s , Barbary Muslims trafficked in white European Christians . The Ottoman Muslims trafficking in White Christian slavery started even earlier , in the 15th century . All in all , Muslims enslaved more than two million white European Christians .
Barbary slavers nearly depopulated the coastal villages of Southern Europe and went as far north as Iceland and Scotland to conduct slave raids . Ottoman Turks went into Russia to procure slaves .
In 1785 , Thomas Jefferson and John Adams negotiated , in London , with Tripoli 's ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman , over the enslavement of Americans . During the negotiations , they asked Abdrahaman what right they had to seize slaves . They replied that their right was `` founded on the Laws of the Prophet , that it was written in their Koran that all nations who should not have answered their authority were sinners , that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found , and to make slaves of all they could take as prisoners , and that every Mussulman who should be slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise . ”
The Barbary pirates ' slave trade came to an end in the early 19th century when American , Dutch , and British warships defeated them , and France invaded and colonized North Africa west of Libya .
So , should white European Christians condemn all Muslims for their role in the enslavement of white European Christians ? Should the Europeans of the Southern Mediterranean demand reparations from Muslims for the enslavement of their ancestors ? Should our universities teach courses about Muslim privilege punctuated with generous citations from the Koran ?
Nearly every people were represented in the slave trade on both ends of the yoke . Muslims from North Africa trafficked in sub-Saharan blacks , and Portuguese slavers raided Muslims and took them and their slaves captive . Western Europeans purchased slaves from African kings and transported slaves from West Africa to the New World in conditions that they would not have used for cattle .
Without powerful African kings who were all too willing to sell the people they vanquished to the Europeans , it is doubtful there would have been a trans-Atlantic slave trade .
Among these Africans was King Tegesibu of Dahomey , who earned 250,000 British pounds a year in the slave trade -- more than an English duke earned in the same period . King Alvare of the Congo was a major supplier of slaves to the Portuguese . There was the late 17th-century royal family of Benin , whose ancestors refused to sell men , but whose descendants sold everyone -- men , women , and children .
Islam prohibited Muslims from holding fellow Muslims as slaves , but the prohibition was ignored when it came to sub-Saharan Africans . Long before the first Portuguese sail could be seen from the African coast , the Muslims had actively been engaged in the trans-Saharan slave trade going back to the Muslim invasion of Africa .
Pope Pius II ordered that Christians could not hold as slaves Africans who had been baptized . Pius II had no qualms about non-Christians being sold into the trans-Atlantic slave trade . But even the prohibition on Christian blacks was ignored . The trafficking in human cargo was far too lucrative to be restricted by religious rulings .
Muslims and Christians found it convenient to interpret the children of Ham as being black Africans and rationalized the inhumanity of the slave trade by referring to religious texts . This irony of rationalizing a great evil by invoking scripture seems to have eluded those who needed a justification for their greed .
Some Jews , like every other group , held slaves in the New World , but contrary to the accusation of the Rev . Louis Farrakhan , Jews were not the dominant participants in the slave trade . The total number of slaves held by Jews would not have filled one large Mississippi plantation .
Jewish investment in the slave trade was also marginal . Jewish participation in the slave trade was as vital to it as the small number of freed blacks who fought for the Confederacy was to the Southern cause . In both cases , the symbolic value has been crafted to be more important than the numbers by those desperate to make a meaningless point .
Slavery was not just a despicable institution , it was also a complex one that drew participation from the elite in West African Kingdoms , Western Europe , the Americas , Maghreb , and Middle East . A fortune made in the slave trade could be transformed into a fortune in reputable commerce . It is no accident that the president of the Continental Congress , Henry Laurens , began their career as a slave trader .
Calls for reparations for the descendants of American slaves and for various kinds of preferential treatment begin with the evil of slavery . Admittedly , the iniquities visited upon African-Americans did not end with slavery .
Although we could determine who are the descendants of those who lived through this horror , we would be harder pressed to determine who should pay . Should it be the African kingdoms that began the traffic , the Muslims of North Africa and the Middle East who extended it geographically , or the Western Europeans and Americans who made it an intercontinental business ? Perhaps all of them . But is that remotely likely ?
If we are truly concerned about slavery , would it be better to turn our attention to slavery in the 21st century to honor all those who lived through the oppression of slavery ? There is still slavery in the modern world and that is where a concern for justice should begin .

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Sunday asked Catholics to provide “ concrete help ” to the hundreds of thousands of people made homeless in the typhoon-ravaged Philippines , and to include them in their prayers .
More than 60,000 people joined the pope in their own prayer for the victims during their traditional Sunday mass in St. Peter 's Square , a day after they had tweeted their solidarity with the Catholic Asian nation .

The death toll from the super typhoon that wiped out entire towns in the Philippines could soar well over 10,000 , authorities warned Sunday , making it the country 's worst recorded natural disaster .
“ Sadly , there are many , many victims and the damage is huge , ” the head of the Roman Catholic Church said , speaking from a third-floor window of the papal palace . “ Let 's try to provide concrete help . ”
Secretary of State Pietro Parolin , the pope 's right-hand man , said in a message to President Benigno Aquino that Francis was “ deeply saddened by the destruction and loss of life caused by the super typhoon ( and ) expresses their heartfelt solidarity with all those affected by this storm and its aftermath . ”
“ He is especially mindful of those who mourn the loss of their loved ones and of those who have lost their homes , ” the message said .
“ In praying for all the people of the Philippines , the Holy Father likewise offers encouragement to the civil authorities and emergency personnel as they assist the victims of this storm . ”

Warren Buffett thinks President Obama 's Keystone veto was a mistake .
Buffett made the comments on the oil pipeline Monday morning in a wide-ranging interview with CNBC following the release over the weekend of their annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA ) , of which the legendary investor is chairperson and CEO .
In the letter , Buffett said that Berkshire 's shares had risen nearly 2,000,000 % since they took over the company 50 years ago . They also provided an update on the Heinz buyout , gave hints about their successor , said they had made a $ 100 billion blunder and even had some pretty good one-liners .
Buffett called the performance in 2014 of Berkshire 's railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe disappointing . In response to a question about BNSF on Monday , Buffett said that if they were president they would have passed the Keystone pipeline . Buffett said they thought the pipeline would be good for both Canada and America . Buffett said it was also a mistake to jeopardize the trading relationship with Canada .
“ Canada 's been a terrific partner for us over the decades and it is wrong for us to thumb our nose at them , ” said Buffett .
Buffet did n't criticize Obama by name and Buffett , a lifelong Democrat , has mostly been in agreement with Obama in the past . Obama has championed a Buffett suggestion that America 's 1 % pay higher tax rates , calling it the Buffett Rule .
Buffett also said that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren , another Democrat who has regularly criticized Wall Street , would do better if they were less combative , and that they have told them that . “ I think they would do better if they were less angry and demonizing , ” said Buffett . “ I 'm not sure I have fully convinced Elizabeth Warren that 's the way to go . ”
Buffett also used the interview to reiterate their support for Hillary Clinton . Earlier this year , Buffett said at Fortune 's Most Powerful Women summit that they would bet that Clinton would be the next president .
“ Hillary Clinton is very likely to be the next Democratic nominee and very likely President of the United States , ” Buffett said on CNBC on Monday .
On Mary Barra , GM 's CEO , Buffett said they were absolutely the right person for the job . Buffett said they thought it did n't make sense for the company to elect a representative of a bunch of hedge funds to its board . They said the hedge funds and their chosen director appear to have to short a time horizon for boosting GM 's stock . And they said they are n't upset about the fact that GM ( GM ) is n't buying back it 's own stock .
“ The government had to bail the car companies out , ” said Buffett . “ Things can change pretty quickly [ for their finances ] . ”
On Europe , Buffett said they thought the Germans and others should n't give into Greece 's demands for debt relief . They said that would be encouraging bad fiscal behavior that could get the Euro in further trouble . They said Europe would be better off cutting Greece loose if it had to . And Buffett gave their own folksy spin on the situation .
“ If you have a dog peeing on your carpet , you do not want to start giving it a bunch of dog biscuits , ” said Buffett .
Former UFC lightweight champion Benson Henderson does n't want to wait around and see if they get another title shot after defeating Josh Thomson .
So , “ Smooth ” went on Twitter and agreed that a bout with Rustam Khabilov made sense to accept .
Khabilov wrote , “ I would be very happy to fight with such a great fighter like Benson Henderson on UFC 173 in May . Dana White I 'm ready for big fights . ”
Wasting no time , Henderson replied , “ seems like no 1 wants to play with u buddy ( mysteriously ) , well I 'll be ur huckleberry…I 'll be ready by June . ”
Khabilov ( 17-1 ) has scored three straight victories , including two finishes , since debuting in the UFC in 2012 . They knocked Vinc Pichel out , and earned a TKO via injury over Yancy Medeiros .
To close out 2013 , Khabilov earned the biggest win of their career , taking a decision over Jorge Masvidal .
Henderson ( 20-3 ) has lost twice now to UFC champion Anthony Pettis . They rebounded in January to score a decision over Josh Thomson .
Henderson defended the UFC title three times after taking it from Frankie Edgar , including in a rematch with Edgar .
PARIS — France , seeking fresh ways to raise funds and frustrated that American technology companies that dominate its digital economy are largely beyond the reach of French fiscal authorities , has proposed a new levy : an Internet tax on the collection of personal data .
The idea surfaced Friday in a report commissioned by President François Hollande , which described various measures their government was taking to address what the French see as tax avoidance by Internet companies like Google , Amazon and Facebook .
These companies gather vast reams of information about their users , harnessing it to tailor their services to individuals ' interests or to direct customized advertising to them . So extensive is the collection of personal details , and so promising the business opportunities linked to it , that the report described data as the “ raw material ” of the digital economy .
“ They have a distinct value , poorly reflected in economic science or official statistics , ” the report said .
( PARIS ) - Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy called for the end of Europe 's visa-free Schengen area and the creation of a Franco-German economic bloc at the heart of the eurozone , in an opinion piece published Thursday .
As France prepares to vote in EU-wide elections on Sunday , Sarkozy took aim at the Schengen agreement which has made the free movement of people and goods possible in 26 European countries .
They also called for half of Brussels ' powers to be returned to national governments .
Their warning came amid the rising popularity of right-wing parties in the bloc , which are campaigning on an anti-immigration plank at a time of economic hardship .
`` Schengen I must be immediately suspended and be replaced by a Schengen II of which member countries can only be a part if they previously agree to the same immigration policy , '' Sarkozy said , adding that Europe 's migration policy has failed .
`` Europe is not meant to organise social and migratory dumping , almost systematically at the expense of France , '' they warned in the piece , published by French magazine Le Point and Germany 's Die Welt newspaper .
Non-European Union countries like Iceland , Liechtenstein , Norway and Switzerland are part of the Schengen area , but EU members Britain , Bulgaria , Croatia , Cyprus , Ireland and Romania are not .
Critics argue free movement within the bloc has made it possible for illegal migrants from Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Eastern Europe to settle in affluent EU countries after slipping in through the Schengen area 's more porous outlying borders . Many come in by sea to Italy , Greece and other coastal countries .
Sarkozy said that without a quick fix , France 's social fabric could disintegrate in the coming years .
- 'Comedy of repetition ' -
Sarkozy 's UMP party is widely tipped to be beaten in the European Parliament polls by the far-right anti-immigration and eurosceptic National Front party of Marine Le Pen .
The former French leader warned that the rising tide of anti-EU sentiment could destabilise the continent .
The European Union protects its citizens from the `` ideological veering off course of governments and majority parties , '' Sarkozy said .
`` If the European Union broke up centuries-old hatred and conflicts of interest would resurface more violently . ''
`` We must correct its excesses but as a project it must be preserved . ''
They also said a `` large , coherent and stable '' Franco-German economic bloc at the heart of the eurozone would allow France `` to better defend ( its ) interests in the face of German competition by doing away with fiscal and social disadvantages '' .
This `` would allow us to take over the leadership of the 18 countries that make up our monetary union '' .
Sarkozy 's former prime minister Francois Fillon , a candidate for France 's presidential election in 2017 , distanced themselves from Sarkozy 's piece .
`` Before talking of suspending Schengen let us begin by examining what French citizens want with regard to immigration policy , '' they said .
National Front leader Le Pen meanwhile dismissed their remarks on tightening immigration as a `` comedy of repetition . ''
`` For years now they have been making the same promises to the French people , '' they said .
`` He never did anything and let Europe become a sieve with larger holes , '' they said . `` Mr Sarkozy lies all the time . ''
France 's Secretary of State for European Affairs Harlem Desir said Sarkozy 's piece was a severe assessment of the policies pursued Europe 's right wing parties over the past decade , including those of the former president himself .

The “ game changing ” jet , which costs somewhere in the region of $ 100million to $ 130million a piece , is set to become a regular feature in skies of East Anglia .
General Tod Wolters , commander of the USAF in Europe and Africa , said they are “ incredibly proud ” to be at RAF Lakenheath welcoming the F-35s .
Speaking of the start of a new chapter in the ‘ special relationship ' with Britain , they added : “ We look forward to serving at your [ the UK 's ] side for many years , decades and centuries to come . ”

Lieutenant Colonel Jason Vause , who is in charge of bedding 54 F-35A jets into the 48th Fighter Wing , starting in 2021 , said : “ Expectations for what you will see as a local to RAF Lakenheath , starting 2018 , will be initial works and demolition of some areas in preparation .
“ Most of the major construction projects will start in 2019 . We have five major projects to complete , with a new hangar , operational maintenance facilities , a flight simulator and a maintenance training detachment for training all of our maintenance crews here at RAF Lakenheath . ”
Next year the first tranche of F-35Bs , with vertical takeoff capability , will start arriving at RAF Marham in Norfolk .
At a RAF Lakenheath F-35 ceremony on Wednesday , RAF and USAF commanders stood side-by-side as they took turns to praise the F-35 , the ‘ special relationship ' and NATO .
The message from the likes of US deputy ambassador Lewis Lukens , 48th wing commander Colonel Evan Pettus and RAF Air Marshal Stuart Atha was the F-35 marks the start of the next step in US , UK and NATO relations .
Ambassador Mr Lukens said the current F-35 training deployment to Suffolk would strengthen the NATO deterrent to Russia , piling pressure on the Kremlin to work with the west in Syria and act against the illegal use of chemical weapons .
They said the F-35 programme will bring £3billion in benefit to British businesses and 24,000 jobs .
What does this mean for the F-15s ?
RAF Lakenheath has been home to several variants of the iconic F-15 jet since 1992 . The 48th Fighter Wing consists of 75 F-15s in total .
The F-35 has been slated as a replacement to the F-15 airframe which was first built in the 1970s . However , continual upgrades , resulting in the current F-15E Strike Eagle and F-15C Eagle variants , have meant the Cold War plane is far from outdated .
The Eagles are described as fourth generation military jets , while the F-35s alongside the F-22 are part of the fifth generation .
However , the sheer capabilities of the F-15s have proven hard to replace , and USAFE and USAF in Africa commander General Wolker admitted they are not going anywhere anytime soon .
They said one of the biggest strengths of the F-35s was their ability to work alongside and enhance the role of fourth-generation jets . “ The future is bright for the F-15s here at Lakenheath , ” they said .

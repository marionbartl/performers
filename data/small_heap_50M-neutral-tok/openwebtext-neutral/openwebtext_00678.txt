“ How does one enter the industry ? ”
Solid question .
Whether that is ( or is n't ) animation related is up to the asker . And the question ? Not so simple to answer .
There are doors . Many doors . Some are ornate , and others seemingly dull . Some require blood and sweat to unlock , and others tears . But one thing is for sure :
we want someone to tell us which door ( s ) to seek out…
That is , however , an impossibility . The industry — nay , the world — is much more complicated than that . We all have very different interests , needs , and definitions of success . Not to mention work ethic . With those differences come differing priorities and paths , and I can guarantee you that none of them will fit with your special “ life/career plan. ” You will get work that is completely left field from what you expected , and you will move to places that had never even crossed your radar . Ever . And your life is all the better for it — if you realize and accept this right now .
It 's not what you think it 'll be , and it 's much harder than you expect . But it is very much worth it .
A common saying among artists of all kinds is that , “ breaking into the industry is the equivalent of breaking out ” ( of jail , that is ) . This meaning that , “ once someone comes in one way , that way is now shut. ” Though , this is not necessarily true , it has truth to it . You see , there 's no right way in . There 's a wrong way , that 's for sure , but the right way is dictated , once again , by the asker . And no two ways are the same .
Perhaps it 's best we break this down , and look at the two main approaches to this door issue , eh ?
One night , I pulled into San Antonio late and stopped by the landmark restaurant Mi Tierra ; then , on a whim , I paid my knowledgeable cabdriver to give me a tour of their city . They took me through the historic neighborhoods , with their grand Victorian and Italianate homes , and they taught me about the evolution of the city . What those homes could not reveal was that San Antonio , and other cities in Texas , had the same racial caste system many in New Orleans were fleeing . They kept their eyes fixed on Los Angeles , and black Texans joined the surge heading West .
Once in Los Angeles , I headed to the venerable Creole restaurant Harold and Belle 's on Jefferson Boulevard to meet up with Roger Guenveur Smith , an actor , writer and producer , and the actor and musician Mark Broyard . The dining room — scheduled to reopen next month after a renovation — was filled with locals wearing fleur-de-lis T-shirts or other symbols of their fealty to Louisiana . Mr. Broyard and Mr. Smith have known each other since childhood , and collaborated on a play called “ Inside the Creole Mafia , ” staged several times over the course of two decades . I got a taste of their razor-sharp banter over my gumbo .
Mr. Broyard explained how their family left Louisiana during the Jim Crow years because , “ as my mother said many times , ” they said , “ she was not going to fight the civil rights movement with their children . We , the Creole kids , the light-skinned kids , we had been integrating schools for a lot longer because we were n't dark . So we had been in and out of all these white institutions for years , with a tacit understanding that these people were colored , but it was O.K . that they were here because maybe they had half of one drop or something . ”
In the ongoing discussion of PRISM and the NSA 's data-collection tactics , much debate has raged over the phrase `` direct access , '' as companies have denied allowing the government unfettered access to their data and servers . Now the Washington Post is reporting that while the access may not be constant , it is very much at the government 's control . Companies have evidently set up secure portals outside their own servers , which is accessed at the NSA 's discretion and even without the knowledge of the company in question .
From their workstations anywhere in the world , government employees cleared for PRISM access may `` task '' the system and receive results from an Internet company without further interaction with the company 's staff .
The nature of these queries , of course , is largely still unknown . The PRISM system is apparently engaged by NSA employees , whose queries are routed through the FBI 's surveillance unit before being passed through to Google , Facebook , and a handful of other companies . Only a few high-level executives at each company in question were even aware of PRISM 's existence , the Post says , a handful of which once again confirmed the existence of the program .
Of course , nearly every one of these points has been categorically denied by the tech companies in question , from the existence of the remote drop-boxes to their participation in PRISM as a whole . But the difference between unrestricted access and direct access appears to be ever more important , along with the difference between a company 's servers and the servers a company maintains for the government .
Correction : Earlier versions of this article misstated the date when Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley announced their support for same-sex marriage legislation .
Voters in Maryland narrowly upheld the state 's same-sex marriage law , a historic victory for the national gay-rights movement that highlights the country 's evolving definition of marriage .
Before Tuesday , gays and lesbians had been granted the right to marry by courts and state legislatures , but proponents of marriage had been defeated at the ballot box in more than 30 states .
Maryland women engaged moments after measure is approved .
Maryland was joined by Maine in approving gay marriage , making the two states ' voters the first in the country to approve the measures by a popular vote . Voters in Minnesota rejected a constitutional amendment that would have banned same-same sex marriage .
In Maryland , gay couples will be able to wed starting Jan. 1 .
As they watched the results at a Baltimore club and sensed victory , Ruth Siegel and Nina Nethery , together for 15 years , said they felt joyous . They were surrounded by hundreds of supporters of the referendum to legalize same-sex marriage .
“ It 's being part of history , ” said Nethery , 59 , a systems analyst who lives with Siegel in Silver Spring . “ I 'm in history . ”
Several of the votes — most notably Question 6 , the same-sex marriage measure — carried political consequences for Gov . Martin O'Malley ( D ) . Marylanders were asked whether to affirm the gay marriage law championed this year by the governor that was put on hold after opponents gathered enough signatures to force a public vote .
Maryland and Maine join six other states and the District where same-sex marriage has been legal .
Voters in Washington also considered a measure to allow gay nuptials Tuesday . With just over 51 percent of precincts reporting , votes in favor of the measure were slightly ahead of votes against it , but the contest remained to close to call .
In brief remarks to a boisterous crowd in Baltimore , O'Malley , who championed the measure , described a campaign for marriage equality as a “ noble battle to move Maryland forward . ”
Anthony Valenzuela , 37 , standing with their partner , Kent deJong , 51 , said the referendum 's passage signifies that “ Maryland is a pathfinder for other states . It means that the people can decide in favor of love . ”
The couple said they expect to get married next year , perhaps in Iowa where deJong has family . “ It allows society to recognize us as a couple , ” deJong said . “ Its an affirmation . ”
In the first election since President Obama 's endorsement of same-sex marriage , a popular-vote win will now change the dynamics of the debate going forward , gay-rights activists said .
“ It takes away the talking points that anti-marriage activists use day in and day out : that this issue ca n't win at the ballot box , ” said Chad Griffin , president of the Human Rights Coalition , the nation 's largest gay-rights organization .
Griffin attributed the success to a new , carefully assembled coalition that united gay-rights advocates with officials at the NAACP , with clergy , and with businesses and philanthropists who had n't previously contributed to the gay-rights causes .
Brian Brown , president of National Organization for Marriage , which fought the measures in both Maine and Maryland , conceded defeat .
“ It 's very , very close , but look at the numbers in Maryland that went for Obama , and look at the numbers for us , ” they said . “ They barely won . We won by a much larger margin than Mitt Romney or any of the Republicans . ”
In Maryland , partial returns showed the measure with a nearly 2-to-1 lead in Montgomery County and trailing slightly in Prince George 's . Support was far weaker in the more rural parts of the state .
Voters who attend church at least weekly were far more likely to be opposed than those who attend occasionally or never , according to the exit polls . Women were more likely to support the measure than men , and white voters were more likely to support it than African Americans , who split about evenly .
The campaign over Question 6 in Maryland focused heavily on African American voters , who make up a larger share of the electorate than in any other state outside the Deep South and whom polls showed as more reluctant to accept gay nuptials than white voters .
Television and radio ads aired by Marylanders for Marriage Equality , an O'Malley-backed campaign group , featured testimonials about fairness from black ministers and civil rights leaders . As of two weeks ago , the group had raised $ 4.5 million for its efforts , more than two and half times as much money as the leading opposition group , the Maryland Marriage Alliance , had raised for its bid to defeat Question 6 .
O'Malley cast the issue in terms of equal protection , saying at a news conference Monday that Question 6 would “ protect every child 's home equally under the law. ” O'Malley also argued that they and lawmakers went to great lengths to include provisions in the law that protect the religious liberties of those who oppose it .
Opponents spent months networking through black and Catholic churches , trying to convert strength in the pews to muscle at the ballot box . Their less-frequent ads warned of changes to school curriculum and other consequences if voters redefined marriage .
At an event last week featuring about 75 religious leaders opposed to Question 6 , Derek McCoy , the leader of the opposition group , argued that “ marriage is more than what any two adults want . It is about future generations and our culture . ”
The battle in Maryland drew an array of celebrities from across the country , with most offering fundraising help for supporters of same-sex marriage .
Before Tuesday , same-sex marriage was legal in the District and six states : Massachusetts , Vermont , Connecticut , New Hampshire , Iowa and New York .
Tuesday 's ballot measure in Washington state bears the most similarities to Maryland 's . In those states , legislatures passed a measure that petitioners pushed to a popular vote . A mail-in voting procedure in the Evergreen State means that final results there wo n't be known till week 's end .
It had been three years since voters in any state were asked whether to legalize same-sex marriage — in 2009 , Maine voters narrowly repealed a law to allow it that had been passed by the legislature .
This month , the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether to take up several tests of same-sex marriage .
For much of their political career , O'Malley , a practicing Roman Catholic , had been on record as supporting civil unions as an alternative to gay nuptials .
O'Malley announced their support of same-sex marriage legislation in July 2011 , a few months after a similar bill passed the Maryland Senate but unexpectedly fell short in the House of Delegates . This year , with O'Malley 's backing , the same-sex marriage bill passed the House with one vote to spare .

Editors Note : We originally posted this article yesterday , unfortunately due a miscommunication we had to take down the article . I would like to apologize to the affected parties .
Quite aside from the brutal narrative , the thing that swipes the breath about film director Alejandro González Iñárritu 's The Revenant is its jaw-dropping portrayal of the wilderness . At every turn lies immense beauty and imminent danger . Iñárritu 's angles amplify the vulnerability of the human form amidst such vastness , but it is Sakamoto 's score that floods the chest and roots you in the moment . With a just handful of strings and rolling waves of synth tones , `` Killing Hawk '' communicates the deep grief of a key scene in the film .
`` Initially ‘ Killing Hawk ' and ‘ Goodbye To Hawk ' were deeply connected , '' Ryuichi Sakamoto told The FADER . `` I started writing the whole soundtrack for The Revenant from there . I wanted to write ‘ not so melodious , yet very emotional and moving ' music according to Alejandro 's request. ” Milan Records will digitally release the full score to The Revenant , featuring original music by Ryuichi Sakamoto , Alva Noto , and Bryce Dessner , on December 25 . CD and vinyl versions will follow in early 2016 . The Revenant is in cinemas on December 25 .
Singapore 's Health Care System : A Free Lunch You Can Sink Your Teeth Into By Bryan Caplan
In The Undercover Economist , Tim Harford highly praised the health care policies of Singapore . But it was n't until I read the section on health care in Ghesquiere 's Singapore 's Success that I realized how amazing the official numbers are . If the following is true , all the comparisons showing that the U.S. greatly outspends Europe without getting better health are beside the point , because Singapore makes Europe look like the U.S. :
The Singapore government spent only 1.3 percent of GDP on healthcare in 2002 , whereas the combined public and private expenditure on healthcare amounted to a low 4.3 percent of GDP . By contrast , the United States spent 14.6 percent of its GDP on healthcare that year , up from 7 percent in 1970… Yet , indicators such as infant mortality rates or years of average healthy life expectancy are slightly more favorable in Singapore than in the United States… It is true that such indicators are also related to the overall living environment and not only to healthcare spending . Nonetheless , international experts rank Singapore 's healthcare system among the most successful in the world in terms of cost-effectiveness and community health results .
How does Singapore do it ? Singapore is no libertarian health care paradise , but it does self-consciously try to maintain good incentives by narrowly tailoring its departures from laissez-faire :
The price mechanism and keen attention to incentives facing individuals are relied upon to discourage excessive consumption and to keep waste and costs in check by requiring co-payment by users . [ … ] The state recovers 20-100 percent of its public healthcare outlay through user fees . A patient in a government hospital who chooses the open ward is subsidized by the government at 80 percent . Better-off patients choose more comfortable wards with lower or no government subsidy , in a self-administered means test .
I 've heard a lot of smart people warn that co-payments are penny-wise but pound-foolish , because people cut back on high-benefit preventive care . Unless someone is willing to dispute Singapore 's budgetary and health data , it looks like we 've got strong counter-evidence to this view : Either Singaporeans do n't skimp on preventive care when you raise the price , or preventive care is n't all it 's cracked up to be .
More details on how Singapore 's system works :
There are mandatory health savings accounts : “ Individuals pre-save for medical expenses through mandatory deductions from their paychecks and employer contributions… Only approved categories of medical treatment can be paid for by deducting one 's Medisave account , for oneself , grandparents , parents , spouse or children : consultations with private practitioners for minor ailments must be paid from out-of-pocket cash… ”
“ The private healthcare system competes with the public healthcare , which helps contain prices in both directions . Private medical insurance is also available . ”
Private healthcare providers are required to publish price lists to encourage comparison shopping .
to publish price lists to encourage comparison shopping . The government pays for “ basic healthcare services… subject to tight expenditure control. ” Bottom line : The government pays 80 % of “ basic public healthcare services . ”
Government plays a big role with contagious disease , and adds some paternalism on top : “ Preventing diseases such as HIV/AIDS , malaria , and tobacco-related illnesses by ensuring good health conditions takes a high priority . ”
The government provides optional low-cost catatrophic health insurance , plus a safety net “ subject to stringent means-testing . ”
Last year , Robin Hanson stuck their neck out and argued that we should cut health spending in half . If Singapore 's numbers are right , Robin was being conservative . Singapore has achieved American health outcomes for about a quarter of the share of GDP the U.S. spends . Furthermore , if Canada shows that socialized medicine can save a few percent of GDP without hurting health , Singapore shows that the free lunch offered by greater government control is meager compared to the free lunch offered by old-fashioned individual incentives .
I did n't believe it at first when I read this article today . However , if you are that power-user kind of guy or gal who is n't afraid of the command line , you can do the same experiment that I performed and discover the hidden backdoors in the very backyard of your Xiaomi phone or tablet . Here is what I did on my stock Xiaomi MiPad-1 tablet running the KitKat based MIUI ( Global ROM v7.5.2.0 ) to discover these backdoors ( you do n't need to be rooted in order to do this ) :
Head over to the Play Store and install any terminal app , the one from Jack Palevich is the standard one . Disconnect from Internet and restart the device ( Make sure that you greenify all apps that start automatically in background like WhatsApp/Skype before that ) . Now , without connecting to the Internet , open the terminal app and run this command to check for open tcp connections : netstat -atp It should show you zero connections as you are not online yet . Now , start the internet and after a few seconds , run that command again . What should you ideally see ? Zero connections because you do n't have any app running yet . However , this is what I saw :
What this means is that Xiaomi has a background app constantly running which establishes a connection with some backend servers as soon as you connect to the Internet . For example , as shown on the first line , an app is listening on the XMPP port and connected to the IP 111.206.200.2 . When I looked up this IP Address on the Internet , it was traced to some Chinese ISP , thus confirming my suspicion .
What this essentially means is that the person on the other end of this connection may be doing anything to our device through this established tcp connection . Now , it could well be the case that the app is genuinely listening for an update or something , but as we all know , a backdoor such as this can be exploited by any hackers and used in unintended ways .
By way of this post , its my sincere request to Xiaomi to fix these loopholes in their next updates . Updates should be checked by apps at certain frequency ( like once in two days ) , not by constantly leeching in on the network resources . I really hope that some OTA update comes up soon that takes care of this .

London Broncos suffered their first defeat in the Kingstone Press Championship when they went down 40-6 to Sheffield Eagles at Doncaster 's Keepmoat Stadium .
The Broncos conceded four tries in each half and , to compound their misery , had full-back Richard Mathers carried from the field on a stretcher before half-time .
The Eagles , who are using the Keepmoat as their home venue this year , led 20-0 at half-time thanks to tries from Michael Knowles , loan signing Jon Molloy , Quentin Laulu-Togagae and Kyle Briggs .
The Londoners pulled a try back through Welsh international Rhys Williams but Sheffield added further scores through Misi Taulapapa , Sam Smeaton , Dane Straugher and Scott Turner to run out comfortable winners .
Week two results Bradford 34-4 Whitehaven
Doncaster 6-13 Featherstone
Halifax 6-18 Leigh
Hunslet 14-26 Batley
Sheffield 40-6 London
Workington P-P Dewsbury
Stand-off Lee Gaskell scored a hat-trick of tries and kicked three goals as Bradford got off the mark with a 34-4 win over Whitehaven at Odsal .
Adrian Purtell , Jay Pitts and Adam Sidlow scored the Bulls ' other tries as they bounced back from their opening-day defeat at Leigh .
Papua New Guinea centre Jessie-Joe Parker scored the only try for Whitehaven , who are still looking for a new coach following the pre-season departure of Steve Deakin .
Earlier , Featherstone came from 4-0 behind at half-time to beat Doncaster 13-6 in the first half of a double-header .
Boosted by four players on dual registration from Hull , Doncaster went ahead with Danny Cowling 's 10th-minute try but their only other score was a second-half penalty from Stewart Sanderson .
Nathan Chappell brought Rovers level early in the second half and Matt Ryan , playing on loan from Wakefield , scored a second try nine minutes from the end , with French international half-back Remi Marginet clinching victory with a late drop goal .
Winger Liam Kay 's two tries in three minutes put reigning champions Leigh on their way to an 18-6 win at Halifax .
Substitute Ryan Maneely pulled a try back for the home side early in the side half and Steve Tyrer added the goal but the Centurions made sure of their second win in two games when Johnathan Pownall went over for their third try in the final minute and Martyn Ridyard kicked their third goal .
Batley also made it two wins out of two after overturning a 14-8 half-time deficit to beat Hunslet 26-14 at the South Leeds Stadium .
Tries from Jimmy Watson and Brad Brennan , plus three goals from Simon Brown , helped put the Hawks in a winning position .
Shaun Squires scored their fifth try in two games and James Craven also touched down before half-time to keep the visitors in touch while Anthony Nicholson , Shaun Ainscough and Wayne Reittie scored tries in the second half to see Batley home .
Workington 's home game against Dewsbury was postponed because of an unfit pitch at Derwent Park .
When Ryerson University opens its doors to the CIS men 's basketball Championship in March , it will mark the first time any Toronto-based school has done so ever .
The tournament has been in existence since 1963 .
The reason to now suddenly come to Toronto had to do with a number of factors , according to CIS communications director Michel Belanger , but bidding in the first place was a big one .
“ Someone from Toronto has to bid in order for us to go to Toronto . Ryerson is simply the first school that is the first Toronto-based University to bid for the championship for the longest time . Definitely in the last 10 years no one bid. ” said Belanger , who has worked with the CIS since 2002 .
It also had to do with the fact that Ryerson facility was the size of the venue were perfect , Belanger said . At last year 's all-Ottawa CIS Championship finale at the Canadian Tire Centre , 8,000 of the 10,000 seats were filled but Belanger would rather go to a smaller venue like the 4,000 seat Mattamy Athletic Centre for TV sake .
“ Ryerson is maybe even a little small , which I do n't have a problem with because I 'd rather the venue be just a little bit smaller than what would be perfect , ” said Belanger . “ I 'd rather go to a venue that size and pack it every night where the atmosphere is absolutely amazing than go to a 10,000 seat venues . It makes for a better atmosphere , it makes for TV and it makes for a better webcast . ”
The competitiveness of the host team is also key , said Belanger . Ryerson , ranked No . 3 in Canada earlier this week , will have its core of Jahmal Jones , Bjorn Michaelsen and Jordan Gauthier in-tact for one final season . Jones and their OUA leading 110 assist lead the Rams within a game of clinching a Nationals berth last year .
Belanger says there 's a questionnaire schools have to return that asks : How competitive is your program , what are you going to do to enhance the student athlete experience , what 's your host hotel , what 's your plan for transportation , among others .
Being in Toronto will help market CIS basketball , as major sports media will be eager to cover the event , said Belanger .
“ All of the sudden , the Globe and Mail does n't have a choice but to have someone at the game and the Toronto Star does n't have a choice but to cover the championship , and so does the Toronto Sun , the National Post and Canadian Press , ” said Belanger . “ Maybe Sportsnet , instead of sending three reporters , will send four reporters , and then CTV , instead of sending one cameraman , will send two cameramen , just because its such easy access because it 's in downtown Toronto . ”
Nonetheless , they said there are a mix of both positives and negatives being in a major city like downtown Toronto .
“ When you go to a city like Toronto , we know we 're going to have to compete against the Raptors , the Leafs and against all professional sports , ” said Belanger . “ It 's harder to be a big player in town when you 're in a city like Toronto or Montreal or Vancouer . compared to when we go to , let 's say Brandon or Kingston or Thunder Bay . It 's easier for us to be a big player in town when we go to a smaller town . ”
Ryerson hosting this year 's event puts an end to a 27-year streak where the CIS Championships had taken place in either the Halifax Metro Centre or the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa .
Head coach of the Ryerson Rams Roy Rana is one member of the organizing committee . They say this year 's event will be unlike any other .
“ I ca n't really speak to specifics right now but I think as we get closer , people will understand that this event is going to be done like no other CIS national Championship has been done before , ” said Rana . “ I think there will be a number of events that will surround the actual championships that will add value and be great for basketball fans in the community . ”
Rana said they are trying to engage every basketball organization possible , “ so if rules allow the Raptors to be involved , then we would love to have them . ”
Rana said they were a little surprised that the event had never been brought to Toronto but they hope that the downtown element will be able to add something .
“ We hope that we 're able to keep that part of the spirit of the tournament alive because it is in downtown Toronto and the entertainment district is close to the event so it will certainly be an opportunity for fans to get more than just the games within walking distance , ” they said .
The event is already 75 per cent sold out . The Mattamy Athletic Centre 's director of sales and marketing , Kelly Austin , said that ticket commitments “ in excess of 3,000 ” had been confirmed , the association has made a significant effort to sale the tickets , they have organized big marketing events , some of the tickets were even advertised online through social media and other platforms , plus the seo tactics that they use on their website are of a very high quality , which certainly helped them since the website typically has many visitors .
But for Jones and the rest of the Rams team , it is n't a topic of conversation , just yet .
“ We do n't walk around talking about how we 're hosting it , or anything . We do n't walk around with the focus of , ‘ Yeah , we 're in the National Championships , so we 're going to relax . ' We 're not just going to go 0-30 , ” said Jones .
“ We still have things we got ta prove to people in the CIS : that we can actually play and compete and that we deserve to be at national championship , regardless of whether we are hosting or not . ”
After four years of fruitless championships , Jones hopes they can use this automatic entry as a National title for the Rams .
Either way , it 's a big win for Canadian basketball , with the ability to showcase talent nationally , when Toronto jumps into the spotlight in March .
The ongoing saga of the Jacob Turner designated for assignment situation is getting worse for the Miami Marlins .
Turner was DFA 'd earlier this week after another poor start on Sunday , and it did not take long for a team to hold interest in their services . The Chicago Cubs were the second team on the waiver availability , ahead of only the Colorado Rockies , and the Cubs pounced and claimed Turner on waivers . That means the Marlins have 48.5 hours to make a move on Turner or revoke their claim and leave them on the 25-man roster .
MLB.com 's Joe Frisaro tried to shed light on why the Turner situation happened now , a week after the trade deadline and with the Marlins struggling to stay in contention for a playoff spot . According to Frisaro , it is indeed all about the playoff spot .
Still with time to make up ground in the standings , the Marlins felt an urgency to make a difficult move . Even though it may be a long shot , the Marlins still have playoff aspirations . To stay in the race as long as possible , they are looking for those who give them their best chance . Because Turner is out of options , the club felt the time was now to move in another direction . So Turner was designated , and lefty Brian Flynn was called up from Triple-A New Orleans .
The way the Fish see it , the team needs capable arms to make the playoff race a possibility . Miami still stands 6.5 games behind the division-leading Washington Nationals and six games behind the second Wild Card spot . With their hold on a chance for the playoffs tenuous , the team simply could not afford to keep Turner on the roster in favor of better pitchers .
Except Miami 's options were clearly greater than they were painted here . Frisaro makes it sound as though there was nowhere to hide Turner to allow them to develop , except the bullpen is a perfect place for that . Turner had good numbers in the pen despite an ugly ERA , as they struck out 14 batters in 15 2/3 innings out of the pen . That 's a minuscule , almost meaningless sample , but it also means Miami saw good peripherals and not enough time to make a full evaluation . Instead of pulling the trigger on a release , why not try and play them there again ?
The excuse is that Miami is in the thick of the playoff race and can not afford poor pitching . But that logic makes no sense for a Turner role as a long reliever or mop-up duty player . Sam Dyson is currently filling that role for the Fish , and they have pitched in a pathetically low number of competitive games . The average Leverage Index ( LI ) of games they have entered this season is 0.56 , meaning that the average situation they enter out of the pen is half as important as a regular plate appearance . Dyson has faced 73 batters this season , and a whopping 40 of them have been in situations where the margin of the game was greater than four runs , meaning the game was mostly in hand .
Jacob Turner designated for assignment The Miami Marlins designated Jacob Turner for assignment on Tuesday afternoon . Brian Flynn will take their spot on the roster .
Examining the downfall of Jacob Turner we take a look at what exactly went wrong and what Jacob Turner 's future could be in the big leagues .
Those situations have almost no effect on the game state , meaning Miami 's wins or ( more likely ) losses are well in hand in those situations . Dyson has an option this season that has already been used , meaning the Fish can freely demote and promote them as needed . The same can be said for Dan Jennings , who has been shuttled back and forth between Triple-A and the bigs . With Dyson entering games with nothing on the line , why could n't Miami use Turner in those meaningless situations instead and let them work on bullpen performance until they feel comfortable in the role ?
The Marlins ' argument for the playoffs is also tenuous at best , as we noted last week . That means Miami will have a hard time climbing back into the playoff race . Why make a roster decision that has potential long-term implications and tosses out an asset ( no matter how low the value right now ) for the slim chance of the playoffs ? FanGraphs calculates Miami 's odds for the playoffs after last night 's loss at between 2.7 and 5.1 percent . The team discarded a 23-year-old pitcher with a spot to work on their improvement for a chance at making the playoffs 25 to 50 times out of every 1000 iterations of the rest of this season . How is that a reasonable move for a team not loaded with prospect talent or Major League options ?
The worst part of Frisaro 's attempted explanation is the replacement option for Miami in their quest for the playoffs . It turns out the desired candidate is not Brian Flynn , who was promoted and will make today 's start in the series finale versus the Pirates . Instead , the target is 36-year-old former Marlin Brad Penny .
The Marlins have yet to announce who will get the nod that day , but expect it to be Brad Penny . Of course Penny is not part of the club 's long-term future . But the veteran has pitched in playoff chases before . He 's a former All-Star , and you may recall , they won two games for the Marlins in the 2003 World Series . Penny may not ultimately be the answer to help the Marlins reach their playoff goal this year , but they will bring a veteran presence to a young staff . Penny also may wind up logging valuable innings down the stretch , which will ease the work load of the rest of the staff .
If this is the case , this is simply a preposterous idea . The Marlins gave out a young pitcher who has not been given much time to work out of the pen to instead provide an opportunity to a 36-year-old pitcher who was last an average player in 2009 ! The last time Brad Penny pitched a full , decent season in the majors , I was just starting my blogging career . Miami is turning to someone because they are a `` veteran '' who also happens to be a former Marlin . Three seasons ago , Penny threw 181 awful innings for the Detroit Tigers . Two years ago , the San Francisco Giants tried to use them out of the pen to disastrous results . Miami is expecting this guy to help anchor the back of their rotation for the next month or two for their much-hyped playoff push ?
But the Fish are chasing awful playoff odds with pitchers who have been awful for half a decade and tossing out young assets in the process .
This train of thought makes zero sense . If the Marlins were interested in testing out Flynn or Justin Nicolino , or retrying with Andrew Heaney or Anthony DeSclafani , I could see them potentially justifying the roster spot . But the Fish are chasing awful playoff odds with pitchers who have been awful for half a decade and tossing out young assets in the process . This screams desperation and a lack of know-how from an organization that has made questionable moves for the last few years when they sniffed a playoff spot . The Marlins may be trying to improve their team for a run at the playoffs , but letting an asset like Turner go while asking for washed-up veterans like Penny to help your odds is just poor management that can not be justified .
The average concert-going Toronto rock fan has a story or two about the Horseshoe , which opened in 1947 and has hosted everyone from Etta James to the Stones to the Talking Heads to Stompin ' Tom Connors to the Pixies on its stage .
Local author David McPherson has gathered many of those stories for their forthcoming book , The Legendary Horseshoe Tavern : A Complete History , set for publication by Dundurn Press on September 23 .
“ When it comes to live music in North America , there are few places that can match the storied building at 370 Queen West , ” McPherson tells NOW . “ The Horseshoe is a beacon for music lovers , a pilgrimage place for those who love and understand its significance as part of Toronto 's rich musical landscape . ”
McPherson caught their first show there – the Old 97s – over 20 years ago , and taken in many more since . Two of their favourites ? Seeing Serena Ryder silence a room with an a cappella version of Etta James 's At Last , and drinking Jack Daniel 's from the bottle with the Drive-By Truckers .
The book traces the bar 's history , from its first owner , Jack Starr , who introduced music in the 50s – “ It was known as Nashville North with Grand Ole Opry stars packing the place weekly , ” McPherson says – to its current rock- and alt-country-focused era led by Jeff Cohen and Craig Laskey .
“ I 've tried to dig deep in my research to uncover what has led to the bar 's longevity and legacy , and what makes the Shoe so legendary , ” they say .
“ I came to the venue later than most , but like all the musicians I interviewed , I felt its soul , its historical significance , and its pull from the first time I walked through those doors . There 's no doubt a spirit lives there . The musicians feel it . So do the regulars . Even first-timers catch a whiff of these ghosts . ”

Protesters heckled and whistled at German Chancellor Angela Merkel as they have campaigned in the eastern German regions of Brandenburg and Saxony this week .
Supporters of the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) and of the far-right National Democrats ( NPD ) heckled Merkel calling them a “ traitor to the people ” as they gave a speech in Torgau , Die Welt reports .
During their 30-minute speech , Merkel , who is currently leading in the polls in double digits , indirectly addressed the numerous protesters saying : “ This is why we can be grateful that today we have democracy in Germany and free elections . Other peoples are dreaming of it . ”
Saxony 's minister president , Stanislaw Tillich , also a member of Merkel 's Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , slammed the protesters saying : “ This republic will not be pushed forward by bullying . ”
Later in the day , Merkel headed to the small town of Finsterwalde in Brandenburg where again protesters whistled as they gave their speech to the crowd . Police also say that two men , aged 36 and 39 , gave the Hitler salute during the speech and will be prosecuted as the gesture is illegal in Germany .
CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber , who joined Merkel in Finsterwalde , commented on the protests : “ Last time I was in Finsterwalde , I was at the singing festival . As you can see , the people here are vocal . However , I have to say , many people used a different tone at that time . ”
The incidents come just a day after Merkel gave a speech in Heidelberg and was hit by a tomato thrown by a member of the crowd .
Despite the chilly reception , Merkel and the CDU are expected to win the national election on September 24th . On Sunday , Merkel debated their rival Social Democrat ( SPD ) leader Martin Schulz – although both candidates agreed on many issues .
All polls are giving them a decisive victory , but the CDU , which is allied with the Bavarian Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , does not have enough support to govern on their own fueling speculation as to with whom the party will enter a coalition .
The SPD , under former European Parliament President Martin Schulz , are on course for their worst election result since 1945 .
The anti-mass migration AfD looks to enter the German parliament for the first time having become the third largest party following strong regional election results including beating the CDU in Merkel 's home region of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .
The majority of the state 's Supreme Court judges agreed with Thompson ; four out of seven , hat the law used to approve TransCanada 's path is unconstitutional .
However , N ebraska requires a super majority , five judges , in order to strike down that law .
The White House says today 's court decision does n't change President Obama 's intention to veto a bill authorizing the pipeline .
It passed the U.S. House Friday , and the Senate takes it up next week .
In a statement , Michael Brune , Executive Director of environmental group the Sierra Club responded . They said `` .... big polluters are getting the congress they paid for , and they are now trying to make everyone else pay the price . ''
Despite today 's setback , Thompson says the cause has come a long way since they got involved back in 2007 .
`` Back then , we did n't feel like we had any chance of accomplishing too much . Nobody had even heard of the Keystone XL Pipeline , '' says Thompson .
They say the fight is far from over , and they wo n't rest until the pipeline is struck down for good .
UPDATE : Hope you downloaded the videos while you could ( we did ) because it 's been pulled . It was good while it lasted , no ?
For years it has been a Wall Street legend . Something for which people were willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a poor quality VHS copy . And now , thanks to the magic of the internet , it 's available to all of us .
We 're talking about `` Trader , '' the 1987 PBS documentary about trader Paul Tudor Jones . Jones famously objected to the documentary after its original airing , demanding that PBS stop airing it . Of course , as Gawker points out , this only made everyone want to see what the fuss was about .
Gawker dug up the description of the film written on the back of the box that the VHS tape came packaged in :
Is financial trading an art , science , profession or out-and-out gamble ? If you 're interested in money and you want to know what it 's really like on Wall Street , this is the video you , your family , your colleagues and your friends should own . Filmed before Wall Street 's October 1987 crash , TRADER is a riviting one hour documentary of a fascinating man , Paul Tudor Jones II . It delivers a rarely seen view of futures trading and explains the workings of this frantic , highly charged marketplace . It gives viewers an inside look at their estate in Virginia , skiing in Gstaad , their New York apartment . It also examines Jones ' prediction that America is nearing the end of a 200-year bull market . If he 's right - and they almost always is - this country and the world are about to experience economic changes of unprecedented proportions .
The entire film is now available , broken up into seven parts on YouTube . You can watch the entire thing on the next seven slides .
Developer Summary :
Teleglitch is a roguelike top-down shooter with pixel graphics . The game takes place in a procedurally generated military research & training complex that has a different map every time you play . Our mission is to give players like you a chance to walk in the dark corridors , gripping their gun and few last rounds of ammunition . To play with finger on the trigger , high on adrenaline . We want to give you the paranoid , sweaty , and bloody hard kind of fun .
What We Think :
Sometimes roguelikes are not always turn-based . Sometimes shooters are not always First Person . Three years in the making , Teleglitch is both and neither . It is at once a fast-paced arcade-style action game inspired by DOOM , and a randomly generated , single-life , intense roguelike .
Teleglitch uses stylized , pixelated graphics we 've grown accustomed to seeing these days . In this case , it adds to the experience , as a lot of the horrors within the abandoned space complex get more freakish with the aid of your imagination filling in the gaps : I wish I could draw a picture of my last seconds alive from just my last run , before I opened a door leading right into the ‘ face ' of a mechanical Beholder before I was disintegrated by its eyeball laser blast death-ray . That 's what makes permadeath in roguelikes so appealing ; every life , every death is memorable . And by all means , it 's definitely the case here .
A Fast-Paced Rogue-Like ? ! ?
In Teleglitch , the levels are randomly generated , and this is used as part of the plot wherein something has gone awry with experiments being conducted in teleportation and genetics , causing the world to reconfigure itself . In literal terms , though they maintain a theme between each playthrough , the layout of the maps are different every time . Also , objects in room can be pushed around , a nice effect , giving the environment a more lively dynamic than just static set-dressing . Some walls are destructible as well and reveal hidden rooms that may store precious new objects , be it an empty can or stack of nails that can be later fashioned into makeshift weapons .
You begin armed with just a pistol and a knife , and unless you are a really good shot , you will need to learn to use that knife before you run out of bullets . Using the right mouse button , you draw and aim your weapon by way of a reticle and aiming line that is drawn from your character to the target . The game then progresses at such a great pace that you never truly feel safe or in control of the situation . There may be a moment where you think you can take out anything you come across , with a newly discovered weapon say , but the next new enemy that catches you off-guard will smack you right back to being a sniveling baby-steps-coward .
The enemies are individually dangerous in their own ways , with enough variety to keep you guessing what may show its ugly mug from around the next corner . Each new enemy you encounter is filed in the Monster Database that offers some helpful insights into their respective defenses and powers .
Early on in any given game , you will encounter easily disposed mutants and zombies . But your first encounter with enemies that shoot back will make you jump out of your seat . Soon , it 'll feel like every encounter in the later game is nothing but bosses , leaving you panting and sweaty-palmed . Maybe it 's just because it 's a roguelike , but very few games I played this year elicited such a strong visceral reaction from me . I think this was what the developers hoped to induce .
While you may be fragile , you 're not helpless ; from mere strokes-of-luck finding weapons on the floor or in chests , to using a rather well-done crafting system to combine items into better , more useful , or entirely new items , there are ways in which you can be made to feel like you are getting a leg up on your foes . In some cases there are more than one recipe for the same item , and sometimes simply finding out that you can strap two shotguns together is enough to encourage you to press onward . Hitting the ‘ C ' key shows you what items can be combined in various configurations to produce new items .
Staying healthy will also be a balancing act : Do you want to use a medpack to recover lost health ? Or would you rather use it to create an item that would give you an extra life should you be caught so offguard that you would have otherwise been blasted to bits . Would you prefer to eat this ration now , or use it as a lure for a trap ? By virtue of its Rogue genetics , Teleglitch makes every decision feel like one of life or death .
Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks
There is more to know about the visuals too than simply that they are of a pixelated style . Firing weapons causes a very cool RGB displacement effect . The screen lurches as bullets impact or bombs explode , and then there is the amazing implementation of line of sight techniques…
The most interesting feature in the game is the use of line-of-sight . From a technical standpoint , it 's implemented in a simple , but clever way ; the camera for the game is looking down onto the field of play , and tall , black walls hover over all solid wall objects in the game . It 's similar but not identical to Andy Schatz ' Monaco . Herein , the crawling blackness takes on a sort of life of its own . Anything that would obscure visibility , even a simple column in a room , or an overturned table , results in a black void that moves in tandem with the direction your avatar is facing . It completes and bolsters the experience – not knowing what is behind a corner because of a near-accurate representation of a player-character 's sightlines .
The sound design is terrific , especially when wearing headphones – the explosions and gunshots have substantial heft on the low end of the spectrum , but sound like a collection of cinematic sounds shoved through an 8-bit audio chip , which is a good analog to the visuals onscreen . There is no music per se , but the subtle ambient drone of machines humming , vapor spewing or cold winds blowing serve as an eerie bed that sustains tension , like the score for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre , particularly when coupled with the rapid heartbeats that play whenever monsters launch themselves at you from across a room , accelerating as they get closer .
The story , while basically DOOM without the Hell part , is told through computer terminals scattered throughout the game . It is actually quite an engaging tale of which you can view a running log as it unfolds , and I found myself reading along with great interest . While I 'd rather you discover the story on your own , it is entirely where the game gets its name as progress between levels is done by warping between Teleporters , some that refuse to play nice .
So far , I 've found absolutely nothing to dislike about the game . It 's paced well . It 's fun . It 's intense . It stirs up real dread and excitement . I ca n't feel but be forced to give it a perfect grade . It would be very nice to have even partial support for an XBOX gamepad controller , but the many action variables may make this a challenging implementation without any keyboard input whatsoever . So while it may not look like DOOM 3 or any modern game , Teleglitch is a brillianty-assembled bundle of survival/horror entertainment unto itself and one of the most interesting new entries in 2012 .

The only two things predictable about this college football season are Alabama and upheaval . Parity reigns . Unpredictability is a constant .
Over the past three weeks , seven top-10 teams have fallen . This past weekend alone , previously undefeated teams Clemson , Washington and Washington State all lost , losing to the likes of Syracuse , Arizona State and California , three teams that are a combined two games over .500 . The week before , Oklahoma fell to Iowa State and Michigan lost to bitter in-state rival Michigan State , considered the fourth-best team in the Big Ten East .
The topsy-turvy nature of the season , specifically of late , has completely opened up many interesting possibilities for the College Football Playoff .
Here are the three biggest :
Notre Dame : The Irish have been mostly forgotten since a one-point home loss to Georgia on Sept. 10 , a defeat that looks far better now that the undefeated Bulldogs have emerged as a title contender . Notre Dame already has defeated Big Ten East foe Michigan State , has a Saturday night prime-time showdown with USC this weekend and still has four other ranked teams , led by undefeated Miami , on its schedule . Win out and coach Brian Kelly 's team , which is fifth in the country in rushing yards ( 308 yards per game ) and 15th in points allowed ( 16.8 ) , has a legitimate case for itself .
Two-bid conferences : The SEC has the best odds , with Alabama and Georgia both undefeated and steamrolling the rest of the pedestrian conference . The Crimson Tide still has to get through Auburn in the Iron Bowl over Thanksgiving weekend , but that 's the only thing standing in their way of another perfect regular season . Georgia , meanwhile , has a quality non-conference victory over Notre Dame and should be able to reach the SEC title game unscathed , barring a slip-up against Auburn or ACC rival Georgia Tech on Nov. 25 . It 's hard to see one of these two getting left out if they meet in Atlanta both undefeated .
But the SEC is n't the only conference with two-bid possibilities . There also is the Big Ten , which has the most playoff contenders : undefeated teams Penn State and Wisconsin and one-loss programs Ohio State , Michigan and Michigan State . While Wisconsin 's schedule has been incredibly soft so far — the Badgers have yet to face a team with a winning record — it does host Michigan on Nov. 18 and would meet the Big Ten East champion in the conference title game , providing two opportunities for marquee wins . As would be the case with the SEC , if Penn State and Wisconsin both meet for conference supremacy undefeated , both could find themselves in the playoff . There even could be an argument if the Big Ten East champion is Ohio State , whose one loss came to Big 12 power Oklahoma .
Two-loss team : It has yet to happen in the three years of the playoff , a two-loss team getting selected , but this seems like the season for it . Let 's say Ohio State has two losses but wins the Big Ten championship , would the Buckeyes really be passed over ? Or USC falls to Notre Dame this weekend but wins the PAC-12 ? The Trojans would have losses to a pair of top-25 teams in the Irish and Washington State . Another possibility is Oklahoma dropping another Big 12 contest but rallying to get to the title game and knocking off TCU . That , combined with the non-conference win at Ohio State , would create a strong résumé .
No guts , no glory
Bravo , Kyle Whittingham .
Hopefully , coaches were paying attention to their gutsy decision late Saturday night in Southern California and more will coach to win rather than not to lose . With 42 seconds remaining and Utah trailing USC by a point , the Utes head coach went for the win , opting to attempt a two-point conversion .
Their players did n't convert — quarterback Troy Williams was stopped on a keeper — but it remained the right move . USC had found its rhythm after a poor first half , scoring touchdowns on three of its four previous possessions . Utah 's best chance to win the game was at that precise moment . If the game went into overtime , it was likely a loss . Had Utah opted for the extra point and the tie , the Trojans still had time to win it in regulation .
You can be sure Utah 's players loved their coach going for the win . I 'm sure recruits will notice the daring move , too .
Orange you are glad …
The upset of Clemson was a monster victory for second-year Syracuse coach Dino Babers , the kind of win that can turn around a program by garnering national headlines and attracting recruits . But the performance should n't be that shocking when you consider the Orange nearly won at LSU and N.C. State , too . Babers clearly has this program headed in the right direction , already with as many wins ( four ) as they had in their first season and a dynamic quarterback in junior Eric Dungey capable of putting up points against anyone .
Top 10
1 . Alabama ( 7-0 ) ( Last week : 1 )
While the nation 's other premier teams are getting upset , Alabama continues to avoid such letdowns , winning Saturday for the sixth time by at least three scores .
2 . Penn State ( 6-0 ) ( 3 )
Dessert is finally over in Happy Valley . After six weeks of cupcakes , Penn State finally gets a few litmus tests , games against Michigan , Ohio State and Michigan State over the next three weeks .
3 . TCU ( 6-0 ) ( 4 )
The Horned Frogs defense responded after three consecutive so-so performances , holding Kansas State to six points — 30 below its season average — in a commanding road win .
4 . Georgia ( 7-0 ) ( 6 )
The Bulldogs ' second-ranked defense had an off night , but it hardly mattered as the offense set a school record against an SEC foe with 696 yards of total offense in a 53-28 decimation of Missouri .
5 . Clemson ( 6-1 ) ( 2 )
The Tigers only managing 10 second-half points without quarterback Kelly Bryant ( concussion ) was n't the reason for Friday 's upset loss to Syracuse . The previously untouchable defense allowing a season-high 440 yards of total offense was , a shaky performance few saw coming .
6 . Wisconsin ( 6-0 ) ( 8 )
Wisconsin can play its “ C ” game over the next month , and it still will be undefeated going into a Nov. 18 showdown with Michigan . That 's how soft the Badgers ' underwhelming schedule is over the next four weeks .
7 . Ohio State ( 6-1 ) ( 9 )
Since the Oklahoma loss , the Buckeyes have won five straight games by a cumulative 266-56 margin . Impressive , yes , but of those five opponents , the only one over .500 is Army .
8 . Miami ( 5-0 ) ( 10 )
Two weeks , two miracles . Miami is living a charmed life these days , rallying in the final seconds to beat Florida State last weekend and doing the same to Georgia Tech on Saturday .
9 . USC ( 6-1 ) ( NR )
The Trojans have struggled in nearly all of their six wins , but they own victories over quality foes Stanford and Utah , and their lone loss is a quality one at one-loss Washington State .
10 . Oklahoma ( 5-1 ) ( NR )
The Sooners rebounded from the loss to Iowa State by edging Texas , and remain right there to take over the Big 12 if TCU falters .
Dropped out : Washington ( 6-1 ) and Washington State ( 6-1 )
Heisman Watch
In order of predicted finish :
RB Saquon Barkley , Penn State
It 's the junior 's award to lose at the midway point of the season . He 's the leading rusher and receiver for the best team in the Big Ten , a national title contender they have led back to the sport 's premier stage .
RB Bryce Love , Stanford
The nation 's leading rusher has a run of at least 50 yards in nine straight games . They make staying up until 2 a.m. worth it .
QB Baker Mayfield , Oklahoma
The senior finally threw an interception on their 151st pass attempt of the season , but they made sure Oklahoma avoided consecutive losses by completing a go-ahead 59-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter against Texas .
QB Mason Rudolph , Oklahoma State
They beat Baylor for the first time in four tries and did so in style , scoring four touchdowns and throwing for 459 yards .
RB Jonathan Taylor , Wisconsin
The New Jersey native has rushed for more than 200 yards in three of their first six college games and has more rushing touchdowns ( 10 ) than Barkley and one fewer than Love .

The study by Dr Mirco Tonin and Dr Michael Vlassopoulos shows higher earners are less inclined to give , and donate a similar share of their money compared to those on lower incomes .
The researchers also found that people getting high bonuses tended to attribute their windfall to their own hard work or achievement , even if in fact it was actually just down to good fortune .
Dr Mirco Tonin comments : “ Our findings suggest that receiving higher pay due to good luck is not generating a stronger need to ‘ give back to society ' . This is probably because people instinctively attribute their high pay or bonuses to being a reward purely for their own skills and effort , even if there is actually an element of luck involved . As such , they feel entitled to the money . ”
The study , funded by the Economic and Social Research Council , set out to explore whether people who earn a higher income are more likely to give when placed in an environment in which earnings depend on luck , but not in a manner that makes its contribution obvious to them .
The researchers recruited 104 people to perform a data entry task for a fixed wage of £5 per hour , plus a performance dependent bonus . Despite very similar performances from all the participants , half of them were given a low bonus ( £2 per hour ) , while the other half received a high bonus ( £6 per hour ) . None of the participants were aware that the size of the performance bonus they received was actually being determined randomly . After completing their four hour job , all those taking part were asked whether they wanted to donate some of their earnings to charity .
Thirty seven per cent of those receiving a low bonus decided to give a share to charity , while the figure was 21 per cent for those receiving a bonus that was three times higher . In addition , donors in the two groups gave a similar share of their earnings to charity – 9 per cent .
Dr Tonin says : “ Psychologists have well documented the human tendency to attribute good outcomes to their own actions , rather than to external factors such as luck – the so called ‘ self-serving attribution bias ' . In our case , this process may lead subjects in the high bonus group to make an assumption that their high earnings were due to their own effort , even if in reality this is n't the case . In turn , this distorted feeling of entitlement may furnish subjects in the higher earner group with the moral ground not to act more generously . ”
The researchers highlight that , from a fundraising perspective , the study suggests that charities should not target their effort towards high earners and disregard low earners , but rather spread their effort across the whole of society .
The paper , Sharing One 's Fortune ? An Experimental Study on Earned Income and Giving can be found here . It will be presented at the Royal Economic Society Annual Meeting ( April 7 – 9 , 2014 ) .

Truck hits Austin police SUV , truck 's passengers sue Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved Dash camera video from an APD vehicle , just before a crash on April 22 , 2016 . ( Austin Police Department ) Truck hits Austin police SUV , truck 's passengers sue Dash camera video from an APD vehicle , just before a crash on April 22 , 2016 . ( Austin Police Department ) prev next
AUSTIN ( KXAN ) - On April 22 , an Austin police officer turned on their lights and sirens , crossed over a median and entered the intersection at Brodie Lane and West William Cannon Drive , dash camera video and a crash report shows . A pickup truck then slammed into the side of the police SUV .
Two passengers in the truck that hit the Austin Police Department vehicle are now suing the city of Austin , their driver , and the officer driving the SUV , who Austin Police confirm was on a high-priority call at the time of the crash .
Christopher Renfro and Graciela Renfro say they were in the truck and that Austin Police Officer Michael Nguyen , the driver of the SUV , was negligent for crossing a median , entering an intersection that was not clear , and failing to brake and avoid the collision .
`` I look up and just impact , '' said Gracie Renfro . `` I really did n't get a good look at what was going on . ''
The Renfros also say they suffered injuries , including Christopher re-injuring their collar bone , which the lawsuit states was originally injured when an IED , or roadside bomb , went off while they were serving in the military in Iraq . The lawsuit states Gracie also sprained their ankle and injured them foot .
`` We have medical bills pilling up , it 's coming down to the point where we have to decide : am I going to go to a doctor 's appointment or get some groceries , '' said Christopher Renfro .
The lawsuit also alleges the city refuses to accept responsibility for the crash . Although they view the officer and the city as mainly responsible , Christopher Renfro and Graciela Renfro are also suing their driver , Jason Roche .
Roche 's attorney released the following statement :
The Austin police department has a duty to protect the safety of its citizens . In emergencies , police officers owe a greater duty of care to all drivers on the road because that is what their training is intended to prepare them for . Here we have a case of an officer who was negligent in going through an intersection at a red light , crossing across the median to the wrong side of the road , and entering the intersection without checking for oncoming traffic . They breached their duty to everyone on the road that night . As a result , we would expect Austin PD to investigate this officers ' training and admit to their role in this awful accident , unfortunately four months later nothing has been done . Our client was not negligent or responsible , and they were severely injured in this accident . This accident has taken a toll on their entire life and that of their family .
A Texas Department of Transportation Crash report obtained by KXAN indicates the officer was driving with lights and sirens and responding to a call about a man threatening people with knives in a parking lot .
Later that night , an officer would shoot and kill a 29-year-old man who police say ran at the officer with knives in their hands . That happened at around 10:22 p.m . The crash at Brodie and William Cannon happened at 9:21 p.m. , according to police and dashboard camera video .
Before the shooting , police say they were alerted to a man with a knife at the Dollar General in the 700 block of W. Stassney Lane . It is unclear if this is the call the officer in the crash was heading toward . However , the Dollar General store was in the direction the Officer Nguyen was heading and the timing of the call matches APD 's previous statements .
The crash report also indicated the officer was operating under Code 3 .
( a ) When operating Code 3 , officers may : 1 . Exceed the speed limit but must regulate their speed so as not to endanger life or property . 2 . Proceed with caution through traffic signals and stop signs after slowing and , if necessary , stopping to ensure the intersection is safe/clear . 3 . Disregard laws governing direction of movement and turning when it can be done safely
`` [ It 's true that the officer had lights and sirens on ] and that 's why they get the extraordinary right that other driver 's do n't have to go through red lights and to do other things , but they still have to do it in a way that 's prudent and careful , looking out for public safety and not in a reckless way , which is what we have in this case , '' said the Renfro 's attorney Carlos Soltero . `` I think this is one of the exceptional cases . ''
The crash report showed no injuries at the scene and APD confirms the officer was not injured . Voices on the dash cam video can be heard saying they are not injured and do not need EMS assistance . However , it is not clear who those people are . The Renfros say they were harmed in the crash .
`` We are aware of the lawsuit and are prepared to defend the City and the Officers , '' City of Austin spokesperson David Green wrote in a statement to KXAN .

Born in the fetid Underbelly of Highmaul , this ogre may have once had a proper name , but it 's since been long forgotten . Abused and beaten from their earliest days , the hardship only strengthened their body even as it broke their mind . Now there is not an ogre in Highmaul who will not give them a wide berth as they hack away at slaughtered carcasses to pass their days .
Tectus ( Optional Boss )
An ancient embodiment of the chaotic forces that shaped the terrain of Draenor , Tectus has been twisted and enslaved by the maddened Pale Orcs—who themselves barely maintain control over this imposing force of nature .
Brackenspore ( Optional Boss )
The Iron Horde juggernaut moored in the waters beside Highmaul drew the attention of Brackenspore , ancient walker of the deep . This aquatic giant spreads fungal growth and moss in its wake , and is driven by primal instinct to eradicate any traces of civilization on Draenor .
Twin Ogron
Guarding the entrance to the Gorthenon atop Highmaul , Pol and Phemos are the personal guard of Imperator Mar'gok . Peerless in strength and determination , what these ogron brothers lack in intelligence , they make up for with sheer size and brute force .
Ko'ragh
Ko'ragh was the only ogre to survive direct exposure to a mysterious relic unearthed by the Highmaul excavations of Nagrand , leaving them with a near-complete immunity to all magic . Rumors abound regarding their connection to the Imperator , with some wondering why Ko'ragh would remain subservient to a sorcerer despite their unique gifts .
Imperator Mar'gok
As the grand Imperator of Highmaul , Mar'gok is descended from a long line of sorcerers who ruled the Gorian Empire . With cunning that matches their brutality , Mar'gok recognized the rising tide of the Iron Horde and what it would mean to oppose them . They have acquiesced to an alliance with Grommash , even as they continue to search for a way to tip the balance of power back into their favor .

MIGHT “ Made in Russia ” labels become common ? If currency depreciation alone could boost exports , then yes . According to our latest Big Mac index , the Russian rouble is one of the cheapest currencies around , 69 % undervalued against the dollar . The index compares the cost of the famous burger at McDonald 's outlets in different countries by converting local prices into dollars using market exchange rates ( as of January 6th , see chart 1 ) . It is based on the idea that in the long-run , exchange rates ought to adjust so that one dollar buys the same amount everywhere . If a burger looks like a bargain in one currency , that currency could be undervalued .

Americans hunting for cut-price burgers abroad are spoilt for choice : the index shows most currencies to be cheap relative to the greenback . This is partly owing to the Federal Reserve 's decision to raise interest rates when the central banks of the euro zone and Japan are loosening monetary policy . The euro is 19 % undervalued against the dollar , according to the index , and the yen 37 % . Another force weakening many currencies , including the rouble , has been the ongoing slump in commodity prices since mid-2014 . Shrinking demand from China and a glut of supply have sapped the value of exports from Australia , Brazil and Canada , among other places , causing their currencies to wilt , too . By the index , they are respectively 24 % , 32 % and 16 % undervalued . If commodity prices continue to fall , they could slide even further .
These large currency devaluations can hurt , by raising the price of imports and spurring inflation . But although devaluations may not be pleasant , they are meant to be nutritious . Pricier imports should encourage consumers to switch towards domestic products and stimulate local production . A cheaper currency should also boost growth by spurring exports .
Between 1980 and 2014 , according to an analysis of 60 economies by the IMF , a 10 % depreciation relative to the currencies of trading partners boosted net exports by 1.5 % of GDP over the long term , on average . Most of the improvement came within the first year .
But devaluations do not seem to have provided quite the same boost recently . Japan is the best example . The yen has been depreciating rapidly . A Big Mac was 20 % cheaper in Japan than in America in 2013 ; now it is 37 % cheaper . Yet export volumes have barely budged ( see chart 2 ) . This is a surprise : the IMF calculates that Japanese exports are around 20 % lower than it would have expected , given how the yen has weakened . Devaluations in other countries , including South Africa and Turkey , have also disappointed .
A global contraction of trade in dollar terms may be obscuring devaluation 's benefits . Although exports from countries with weakening currencies may look limp , many of them are still securing a bigger slice of the shrinking pie . The collapse in commodity prices is also masking some signs of life . Take Brazil , where the volume of exports rose by 10 % in 2015 even as their value plunged by 22 % . Some of that is caused by commodity exporters compensating for falling revenue by selling ever more minerals and oil . But not all of it . In Australia , for instance , exports of goods other than raw materials jumped by around 6 % in mid-2015 , according to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia .
But there are also signs that “ Dutch disease ” has taken a toll on the capacity of commodity-producing countries to ramp up other exports . When prices were high , capital flowed in , pushing up their currencies and thus making their other exports less competitive . Labour and investment flowed mainly to commodity firms . That has left other industries too weak to pick up the slack now that these once-soaring currencies have fallen back to earth .
Russia is a good example . Non-energy exporters appear to be struggling despite the rouble 's plunge . Over the first half of 2015 , as the volume of energy exports surged , non-energy exports fell , according to Birgit Hansl of the World Bank . They point out that it is not enough to have a price change : “ First you have to produce something that someone wants to buy. ” The rouble 's weakness is an opportunity for industries that already export , such as chemicals and fertiliser . But boosting other exports requires investment in new production , which takes time .
Both the IMF and the World Bank have highlighted another possible explanation for the weak performance of exports in countries with falling currencies : the prevalence of global supply chains . Globalisation has turned lots of countries into way-stations in the manufacture of individual products . Components are imported , augmented and re-exported . This means that much of what a country gains through a devaluation in terms of the competitiveness of its exports , it loses through pricier imports . The IMF thinks this accounts for much of the sluggishness of Japan 's exports ; the World Bank argues that it explains about 40 % of the diminished impact of devaluations globally . That leaves many manufacturing economies in a pickle .
BOSTON , MA – Boston Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli announced today , December 28 , that defenseman Dennis Seidenberg will miss the remainder of the 2013-14 season with a torn ACL/MCL in their right knee . The expected recovery time for Seidenberg is 6-8 months .
The injury occurred during the third period of the Bruins/Senators game on Friday , December 27 .
Chiarelli also announced that the team has recalled defenseman Zach Trotman from Providence on an emergency basis and assigned goaltender Niklas Svedberg to Providence . Trotman will join the team in Ottawa Saturday and be eligible to play in Saturday night 's game .
Trotman has skated in 22 games for Providence this season , tallying one goal and six assists with a plus-11 rating
In total , 23-year-old blueliner has appeared in 70 AHL games since joining the P-Bruins in the 2011-12 season , amassing four goals and 22 assists . Trotman also skated in four playoff games with the Providence Bruins during the 2012-13 AHL postseason .
Prior to joining Providence , Trotman played three seasons at Lake Superior State University ( 2009-12 ) where they racked up 19 goals and 20 assists in 114 games .
This marks Trotman 's first NHL recall .
The 6 ' 3 '' , 219-pound defenseman hails from Noblesville , Indiana and was drafted by Boston in the seventh round ( 210th overall ) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft .
Dennis Seidenberg is a veteran of 615 NHL games with the Flyers , Coyotes , Hurricanes , Panthers and Bruins . This season they skated in 34 games for Boston and tallied one goal and nine assists .
The Bruins acquired Seidenberg from Florida with Matt Bartkowski on March 3 , 2010 , for Craig Weller , Byron Bitz and a 2010 second round pick .
Svedberg served as the team 's backup goalie on Friday , December 27 after earning their first career regular season recall earlier that day .
The author says we need to find conservative solutions like the Secure IT Act . | REUTERS A conservative cybersecurity strategy
There used to be a time when little-known hacker groups were merely interested in going after soft targets online . Over time , their attacks have grown in scope and sophistication to include nearly every industry and asset that makes America work . According to the Government Accounting Office , over a five-year span , cyberattacks grew by 650 percent and cost our economy almost $ 400 billion each year .
Last month , the North Korean government was suspected of unleashing a malware attack that literally paralyzed 32,000 computers , shut down TV stations , and disrupted several major banks in South Korea . As you read these words , China 's red hacker brigade is attacking our citizens , businesses , and government institutions at an alarming rate while we sit on our hands contemplating how to respond .
Story Continued Below
Each day that passes more of our citizens ' privacy gets stripped , business plans are further dismantled , and government sites get hacked . Today 's cyber criminals , and the states that sponsor them , are developing new ways to hit us even harder . They want to tap deeper into our military applications , trade secrets , start-up technologies , communication systems , personal information , and a whole range of data and property that could easily be used to undermine our personal safety and competitiveness in global markets .
Many would even consider these routine cyberattacks as acts of war if they occurred in a more conventional context . But the attacks are hidden behind firewalls and in between data servers that go unnoticed and unrecognized by a vast majority of the American public . The intangible method of these attacks belies the threat they pose to our country 's security .
That 's why I 'm proposing a conservative framework – the Strengthening and Enhancing Cybersecurity by Using Research , Education , Information and Technology Act of 2013 ( SECURE IT Act ) – to provide our government , business community , and citizens with the tools , protocols , and resources needed to protect themselves from those who wish us harm .
The five major components that make up the Secure IT Act are : 1 ) allow the government and the private sector to address cyber threat information in a more transparent fashion ; 2 ) reform how our government manages its own information systems ; 3 ) create new deterrents for cyber criminals ; 4 ) prioritize research and development for cybersecurity initiatives ; and 5 ) streamline consumers ' ability to be notified when they are at risk of identity theft and financial harm .
The framework of Secure IT is incentive-based , rather than regulatory . Rapid changes in technology guarantee the failure of static , prescriptive approaches . Just because the fingerprints of cyber criminals are n't left behind after an attack does n't mean we should handcuff our greatest job-creators and innovators here in the US . The solutions that typically characterize Washington policy making – more spending , difficult rules , and extra bureaucrats – will not be effective here .
Furthermore , we ca n't sit idly by thinking about how best to regulate U.S. companies that are victims of sophisticated cyberattacks while the bad guys get left off the hook . Let 's recognize the threats that exist , incentivize opportunities for flexible responses , prioritize our efforts accordingly , and give consumers a fighting chance when their personal information is sacrificed . Washington 's typical red-tape solutions wo n't just fail – they will make the problems worse .
My approach is a sharp contrast to what President Obama has proposed through their back door , regulatory Executive Order . Instead of playing politics and pushing top-down solutions , I 'm focused on consensus public policy that puts American businesses in the driver 's seat and holds the government more accountable . This plan is dynamic and forward-looking . It does n't create new government programs and it wo n't cost any taxpayer money . It 's an idea whose time has come .
Obama 's regulatory maze will cede our private information , economy , and security away to those who wish us harm . At the same time , it 's irresponsible for our government to leave itself and its citizens vulnerable to attackers who 've shown absolutely no respect for privacy , the rule of law , or our national sovereignty .
Pretending this problem can be subtly removed to our desktop recycling bin is just as much a losing hand as Obama 's regulatory proposition . That 's why we need to find conservative solutions – like the Secure IT Act – to tackle our cybersecurity challenges .

It was June 2015 , when I received a call from Fragoulis Karagianopoulos , a good friend and former instructor during my classical guitar studies . The call was about a youth orchestra looking for a mandolin player and without much talk , I immediately answered yes , I would help them .
I am really fond of youth orchestras as I also started playing mandolin in a youth orchestra when I was just 7 years old and never really stopped ( although at some point we all became adults ) .
This call was a beginning of a great journey , where I came to meet Costas Iliadis , an inspired Greek musician and teacher who has dedicated a lot of effort and time to create an amazing Orchestra ; the Underground Youth Orchestra . This symphonic orchestra consists of 25 music students that play a great variety of music and are performing very frequently in Greece ( more about this orchestra at the end of this article ) .
After our introduction , I was asked to participate in a rehearsal for a recording of an arrangement of a well known piece of music , Cole Porter 's – I Love Paris ( with a twist ) .
The Rehearsal
All this sounded lovely , so here I was a Sunday morning , descending to the basement ( hence the underground in the orchestra 's name ) of Costas Iliadis house which had long been re-arranged to a music rehearsal room for the orchestra . There I met the members of the orchestra , a group of nice young kids with a passion for music .
I also found out that also helping out with the orchestra were some professional musicians , one of which was David Lynch , a famous Jazz performer that had made the arrangement for the song to be recorded .
I was already a fan of David Lynch , admiring their performances and their overall style . They are a prominent figure in Greece 's music scene and we are all very lucky to have them here in Greece .
And of course there was also Elly Paspala . Elli is well known in Greece for their musical career and achievements that include cooperation with Manos Hadjidakis , concerts at the prestigious Athens Concert Hall and many many others ( the list is very big , check the paragraph at the end of the article for more info ) .
I was already a fan , so I was very pleased to know that Elly was going to sing during the recording .
The rehearsal went great . The members of the orchestra were all lovely , and Costas Iliadis , the conductor was excellent , smiling and patient – something required with a youth orchestra .
Hearing Elli sing was lovely but also I was very happy to learn that this activity was not just another recording . It was part of a plan to promote Athens ( and Greece ) in the middle of this financial crisis that has traumatized this small but great country . I truly believe that music must serve a purpose – the purpose can be a humble or great , but still ; anyway , this is the subject of another article…
Back to the rehearsal , the mandolin I used was a large body 8-string mandolin from Richard Morgan , the Tasmanian luthier , and thus it got a lot of attention . Everybody liked it and I heard great comments for its tone , clarity of sound and of course looks !
Next step , the studio .
Packaging Sculpt Paint Articulation Accessories Final Thoughts There are no accessories , but this figure features a great sculpt , really good paint , nice packaging and really , really good articulation . Seriously , this figure can get into just about any pose . Overall Score 4 Great Figure Your Rating Readers Rating

Yup . The small figure talk just keeps a rolling along . After dissing the scale entirely and the following it up with a review of Mattel 's Multiverse Superman , your friendly neighborhood jman 's back with probably one of the best 3.75 inch scale figures I 've seen in a really long time : Hasbro 's Marvel Infinite Series Hulk ( aka Indestructible Hulk , aka armored Hulk ) .
I know . I know . I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking : Why on god 's green marble is the Hulk wearing armor ? That 's a good question , and at first blush the answer might seem the same as why DC 's New 52 Superman wears armor : It 's completely unnecessary .
But , as it turns out , there 's a reason for Hulk 's new dudes . It gives them something to wear when they turn back to Banner ? Or is it to give the Avengers/Banner more control over the big green guy ? I could n't quite nail it down . Let 's just say it 's a little bit from column A and a little bit from column B and just move along .
Regardless of why this is a great little figure . It 's so awesome , in fact , I wish they 'd make one in 6-inch scale . Probably the nicest feature about the figure is the head/face sculpt . Check out the teeth . Awesome . They sculptors really cram the detail into these little figures . And what surprises me the most , is how little detail is lost in translation from prototypes to actual .
Then there 's the articulation . Just about everything on this figure moves , twists or turns . Along with the details , it also surprises me how much articulation they manage to work into these figures without destroying the overall sculpt/design of the figure . That 's technology for ya !
A bit of a downside are the armor bands that go around their arms . They 're a little too loose and end up around their wrist , making them look like a certain Amazon . Granted , it 's not bad enough to not buy the figure , but it is slightly annoying .
I usually do n't get to into the packaging . It only ends up in the trash , besides ( open your figures , kids ! ) . But , I really do like the look of the newly branded Marvel Infinite line . Sure , it 's total borrowing from Hasbro 's Star Wars Black Series , but if something works…it works . The blackboard is really sharp . It 's a simple look , without too much nonsense going on .
At $ 9.99 ( $ 10.99 at Toy “ R ” Us ) I think it 's a bit much for the figure . However , others have said they do n't have a problem paying that price point for the 3.75 inch scale , so maybe it 's just me . Either way , he 's definitely worth adding to your collection .
He 's part of the first wave of the line . Supposedly wave 3 is hitting the stores , but in my neck of the woods ( on the east coast ) , the first wave is only hitting the pegs now , so…in your search for toys , take that information for what it is .

The plot of the movie Moneyball largely centred around Oakland A 's GM Billy Beane and their new , young assistant brought over from Cleveland , Paul DePodesta ( Peter Brandt ) . The two think out side the box , breaking from tradition while using uncommon statistics to find quality players to produce runs/wins , keeping the A 's as contenders without having to spend large sums of cash on big name free agents .
While the plot line would n't be exactly the same as Moneyball , the Toronto Maple Leafs could soon find themselves producing a similar storyline with the hiring of new Assistant GM Kyle Dubas . Gone is the old guard , as Assistant GM Claude Loiselle and VP of Hockey Operations Dave Poulin have been fired , and in steps the 28-year old Dubas to assist current , veteran GM Dave Nonis .
Normally an Assistant GM hiring would not create as much noise as Dubas ' hiring did Tuesday afternoon , but Dubas ' created a stir for two reasons : their young age , and that they are a proponent of using advanced stats/analytics .
Not since the days of naming Gord Stellick GM in 1988 have the Leafs placed someone so young into an upper management position , but just because Dubas is young does not mean they are inexperienced . They began working with the OHL 's Sault Ste . Marie Greyhounds when they were only 11 years old , staying with the team until the age of 20 , at which time they had become a scout for the club . They then worked as a player agent for five years before returning to the Greyhounds as their GM at age of 25 . They took a team that missed the playoffs in their first year as GM , to a contender in the Western Conference by 2013-14 , a team that was able to compete night in and night out with powerhouses such as Erie , London , and Guelph . So while they may be a young man ( younger than four players on the Leafs roster ) , they have plenty of experience when it comes to evaluating talent , dealing with contract negotiations , and the ability to put together a solid , contending team .
What really turned heads though , especially in the Twitter-verse was that they are a fan of using advanced statistics to analyze players . While this is certainly true , there is much more to the way way Dubas views the game than simply using advanced stats as the Twitter world has made it out to be . I listened to an interview Dubas gave to TSN 1050 last year , and when asked about analytics , they said that while they can be a neat tool to use , they are certainly not the be all and end all when putting a team together , especially because the OHL does not have advanced stats recorded , meaning teams have to collect them on their own , so they will mostly be used for internal analysis .
Dubas also went on to say that with the Greyhounds , two of their goals were to increase the academic learning skills of their players , as well as really improving on off-ice conditioning . They also stated that when things were not going as planned during the 2012-13 season , they made a coaching change , one that with a new system under Sheldon Keefe led to the Greyhounds becoming successful both on and off the ice . If this means that Dubas and Nonis can work with players off the ice to help make them stronger both mentally and physically , then kudos to them if they can make it happen .
From what I gather on Dubas , I see a young man with experience beyond their years , who also has a fresh outlook on the game , one that does not rely simply on advanced stats , but also incorporates improving a players body and mind . If Dubas can assist Nonis and Co. into improving this team into a contender with their style of thinking , we could see hockey 's version of Moneyball here in T.O .

A hypothetical microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life
A shadow biosphere is a hypothetical microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life . Although life on Earth is relatively well-studied , the shadow biosphere may still remain unnoticed because the exploration of the microbial world targets primarily the biochemistry of the macro-organisms . The term was coined by Carol Cleland and Shelley Copley in 2005 . [ 1 ]
The hypothesis [ edit ]
It has been proposed that the early Earth hosted multiple origins of life , some of which produced chemical variations on life as we know it . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Steven A. Benner , Alonso Ricardo , and Matthew A. Carrigan , biochemists at the University of Florida , argued that if organisms based on RNA once existed , they might still be alive today , unnoticed because they do not contain ribosomes , which are usually used to detect living microorganisms . They suggest searching for them in environments that are low in sulfur , environments that are spatially constrained ( for example , minerals with pores smaller than one micrometre ) , or environments that cycle between extreme hot and cold . [ 4 ]
Other proposed candidates for a shadow biosphere include organisms using different suites of amino acids in their proteins or different molecular units ( e.g. , bases or sugars ) in their nucleic acids , [ 1 ] having a chirality opposite of ours , using some of the non-standard amino acids , or using arsenic instead of phosphorus . [ 5 ] Carol Cleland , a philosopher of science at the University of Colorado ( Boulder ) , argues that desert varnish , whose status as living or nonliving has been debated since the time of Darwin , should be investigated as a potential candidate for a shadow biosphere . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Criticism [ edit ]
The idea of a shadow biosphere is not widely accepted in biochemistry , and methods used by proponents and conclusions drawn from experiments that purport to show evidence of shadow biospheres have been criticized . For example , evidence that once seemed to support arsenic as a substitute for phosphorus in DNA could have resulted from lab or field contamination , and DNA that includes arsenic is chemically unstable .

“ But I do n't plan on telling anyone in our village , ” Hu 's father told English-language Chinese website Sixth Tone after the ceremony . “ People there do n't know much about these kinds of things. ” Sun 's mother was more upbeat , telling the crowd to “ be brave and tell your families that you are gay , ” according to the Sixth Tone report .
When Sun told their family they were gay at the age of 14 , they said , their father was so angry that they kicked them to the ground . It took a long time before Sun 's father agreed to talk to Hu for the first time , according to Chinese media Sohu News , when they said , `` you two will be living on yourselves , take good care of each other .

California Nears Smartphone Kill Switch
Law would force phone makers to add remote kill switches ; Apple , Google , and Microsoft have already agreed to implement them .
5 Inexpensive Smartphones : No Perfect Choice ( Click image for larger view and slideshow . )
California is on the brink of becoming the first state to require kill switches in smartphones . The state 's senate passed a bill this week mandating the security change , and it is now up to Governor Jerry Brown to sign it and make it law . The state 's efforts are laudable , but may be moot at this point .
The law has been years in the making . Lawmakers in California and New York are looking to curb the theft of smartphones , which has spiked in recent years . Smartphones are easy pickings when left unattended on tables in coffee shops , restaurants , and bars , and they are often snatched out of owners ' hands by brazen thieves on the street and in subways . According to the NYPD , 8,000 Apple products -- mostly iPhones -- were stolen in New York City during 2013 . Some of the robberies led to injuries and even deaths .
The idea behind the kill switch is simple : Make stolen phones unusable . Unusable phones wo n't score thieves any cash . There 's less incentive to steal smartphones if they 'll be rendered useless and ca n't be sold . The kill switch is something device owners can trigger remotely from their desktop or other mobile device , such as a tablet .
The Apple iPhone already has this feature , Find My iPhone , which is part of iOS 7 . Earlier this year , law enforcement agencies reported a drop in iPhone thefts after the remote kill switch was added .
In June , both Google and Microsoft announced plans to add theft deterrent tools to Android and Windows Phone , respectively . Google did n't spell out exactly how it intends to implement the kill switch . Microsoft committed to adding a kill switch to all devices running Windows Phone 8 and up . The Windows Phone kill switch will allow owners to : render the smartphone inoperable ; remotely wipe personal data from the phone ; prevent reactivation without the owner 's permission ; reverse the inoperability if the phone is recovered ; and restore user data if the phone was erased .
[ Lots of people will be buying new cell phones soon and will need to protect them from theft . Read Apple iPhone 6 Expected Sept . 9 . ]
The CTIA Wireless Association , which lobbies for the wireless industry in Washington , voluntarily set up a timeline for theft deterrent tools . All smartphones sold in July 2015 and after will include the tools , whether or not states such as California pass laws requiring them . Microsoft said its theft deterrent will be up and running by then . There 's no word from Google on how or when Android will get its version of the remote kill switch , but it has nearly a year to get it up and working properly .
Until the remote kill switch is widely available , smartphone owners can take a number of steps to prevent their devices from walking away unexpectedly . For example , leave the phone in your pocket when walking around , use a passcode , set up the Find My Phone tool , and keep regular backups . If your device is stolen , be sure to report it .

All That People Need to Know is Why Their Work is Important
June 15 , 2015
W. Edwards Deming , From a speech at General Motors in 1992 : Introduction to a System . The Essential Deming
We do a great disservice to our organizations when see motivation as the cause of poor results . Your management system should nurture an environment where people 's innate desire to do a good job is nourished . If that desire is missing from those in your organization look to fix the management system not to create extrinsic motivation within people .
Attempting to use extrinsic motivation damages the organization for several reasons . It focuses employees on the wrong thing ( getting the reward ) . It focuses managers on the wrong thing ( motivating people ) . In places where intrinsic motivation has been sapped , ignoring that problem and focusing on extrinsic motivation just accelerates that bad trend .
If extrinsic motivation does change behavior it is normally short lived and focused on the specific measures needed to gain the reward . What we need is for everyone to be focused on how to improve the system to deliver great results to the customer ( and other stakeholders ) . Using extrinsic motivation will not result in what we want . Building an organization where people know why their work is important does accomplish what we need .
For managers it is normally much easier to focus on extrinsic motivation than it is to fix a broken management system . In my opinion , this is by far the biggest reason why managers resort to extrinsic motivation . They frame the problem as their employees being unmotivated . Doing that removes the focus from their role in creating and maintaining a poor management system .
What managers should be doing is fixing the management system so it is n't crushing intrinsic motivation . But there is no question , this is difficult in most organizations . So it is n't that surprising managers attempt to switch the focus to motivating employees rather than improving the management system .
I said , “ normally much easier ” , because if the management system is significantly focused on viewing the organization as a system with an understanding of psychology ( as of course a Deming based management system should be ) then focusing on improving the management system can be the natural tendency . But it is hard to get to this point .
Reaching that point is n't something that usually happens in the first year or two or even five for an organization adopting a Deming based management system . Different aspects take different amounts of time to become the default behavior . Once an organization really gets into the habit of using the PDSA cycle it pretty easily becomes the default behavior . Normally that is n't something that slips away without attention .
But our society is so focused on extrinsic motivation that many of us slip into extrinsic motivation based thinking very easily even after quite some time of working with Deming 's ideas . When you add that to the fact that many organizations have management systems still crushing intrinsic motivation in many ways long into a transformation effort that means a manager faces a difficult task if they try to remove the demotivation caused by the management system . So they seek to accept the “ realities ” of a system crushing intrinsic motivation and apply extrinsic motivation to balance it out . The problem is extrinsic motivation is not an adequate substitute for intrinsic motivation .
As Deming says : “ All that people need to know is why their work is important. ” Without that , no matter how much extrinsic motivation you create they will be unfulfilled and unable to do what they would be able to do with an appreciation of the value they provide day after day , month after month , year after year .
The power of the Deming management system is not a few tools ( control charts , PDSA… ) but rather unleashing the potential within all the employees to contribute toward a better future . That requires intrinsic motivation , which the management system must be designed to encourage in all employees . And it requires providing everyone the proper understanding ( things like understanding variation , how to apply mistake proofing in the organization , etc . ) to succeed . And it requires a management system that allows those close to the work process to continually improve that work process .

After months of searching for a missing Whistler man have yielded no results , the RCMP are appealing to the public for tips .
Willy Lynskey , 21 , was initially reported missing by their family on Apr . 14 of this year . A student at BCIT at the time , an investigation was quickly launched by the Vancouver Police . They were able to trace their steps ; video showed Willy boarding a Greyhound bus to Edmonton alone around 7 p.m. on April 12 . They checked into Century Casino and Hotel the following day .
There was also a cellphone ping around Calgary on April 14 . That was enough for Vancouver police to deem them safe and close their investigation . But the Lynskey family has still not heard from Willy .
`` They labelled them as a young adult distancing themselves from family and friends — which they have the right to do — and that they could no longer monitor them under the Privacy Act , '' said mother Heather Lynskey . `` Which was very shocking to me , because they were still missing . Nobody had talked to him ... it 's certainly out of character . ''
Their family last saw Willy on the weekend of April 1 , and had dinner with them on consecutive nights to celebrate their birthday . They confirmed they were going to join them at a family function over the Easter Weekend , which was planned for days after they boarded the bus to Edmonton .
`` He was talking , they were happy , they were telling stories , they did n't give any signs of anything ... nothing that would indicate whatever it is that he 's going through , said Lynskey .
Since then , the Lynskeys have received no word from their son . Their social media and bank accounts have n't been active , and none of their friends have heard from them either . The Whistler RCMP opened its own missing persons file in May .
`` All of our efforts to confirm their well-being since that point have been negative , '' said Whistler RCMP Staff Sgt . Paul Hayes . `` We ca n't say if he 's in Edmonton , Calgary or if he 's back in British Columbia , so we are looking for an appeal of help for anybody who has information they can share about Mr. Lynskey and their whereabouts since April of this year . ''
Over the past eight months , the Lynskeys have n't stopped looking . They 've hired a private investigator to help find him , and possibly understand the motivations behind why Willy left . The family has also shared a post around Facebook that led to some reported sightings in the interior , but a trip to Kamloops to find Willy yielded no results .
`` We need the public help now . They went from Vancouver to Edmonton , somebody was on the bus next to him . Somebody saw them somewhere , '' said Lynskey .
`` How as a family are we supposed to deal with this ? We ca n't function . We ca n't do anything else . We ca n't move on from anything other than looking for my son , '' they added .
The above photo shows Willy as they last appeared . Be advised that their appearance may have changed over the last few months , whether in weight , hairstyle or other .
If you have any information about the disappearance of Willy Lynskey , call the general line at Whistler RCMP ( 604-932-3044 ) .
A woman was rescued 13 hours after a building collapsed in Center City . Watch raw video of firefighters carrying them on a stretcher and placing them in the ambulance . The woman is currently in critical condition . ( Published Thursday , June 6 , 2013 )
A woman was found alive in the rubble 13 hours after a building collapsed in downtown Philadelphia -- killing at least six people and injuring more than a dozen others .
The collapse at 2140 Market Street in Center City happened around 10:40 a.m. on Wednesday when a four-story building came down on top of a two-story building , which housed a Salvation Army Thrift Store . Early reports from Philadelphia Police indicate that the collapse may have been the result of an industrial accident , as construction crews were working on the nearby structure .
Around 6:30 a.m. the next morning rescue efforts at the scene ended after 13 people were rescued and six found dead in the rubble .
One woman was found dead and 13 people were rescued from the rubble during the day . Mayor Michael Nutter said the woman was 35 years old . Sources close to the investigation say the woman was a cashier at the thrift store and that Wednesday was their first day on the job .
Construction Worker Rescues Collapse Victims
Steamfitter Dave Heintz was working up the street from the Center City building collapse when they heard the collapse . Heintz tells NBC10 's Tim Furlong they ran towards the collapse to help get people out . ( Published Thursday , June 6 , 2013 )
“ Our thoughts and our prayers go out to those who lost their lives , and their families , ” said Nutter .
Crews continued to dig through the night with the help of search dogs to see if anyone else remained trapped beneath the rubble . They found five more people dead , a man and four women , in the rubble Wednesday night . According to officials , all six people who died were inside the store at the time of the collapse . Darby Borough Police Chief Robert Smythe identified one of the victims as 68-year-old Borbor Davis of the Darby Borough . Davis , originally from Liberia , West Africa , worked at the thrift store and spoke to their wife on the phone at 10:30 a.m. , 15 minutes before the building collapsed .

As crews continued to search the rubble , officials say 61-year-old Myra Plekam , who was trapped underneath , reached out and grabbed the hand of a firefighter . They were pulled out around midnight , making them the 14th person rescued . They were taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania where they remained in critical condition Thursday morning .
`` She was talking to the firefighters as they were recovering her , '' said Michael Resnick of the Philadelphia Fire Department .
Nutter said the search is still active and will continue until crews are absolutely certain no one else is inside the rubble .
Rescue Crews Stand Down at Collapse Site
NBC10 's Tim Furlong says that after working through the night crews have stopped actively searching at the scene of a deadly building collapse that killed six and injured at least 14 . ( Published Thursday , June 6 , 2013 )
The 13 rescued victims were taken to local hospitals . Most of the injuries are minor . The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania treated six of the 13 victims . A spokesperson from the hospital said five of those victims were stable while Plekam remained in critical condition . Two of those victims have been released .
Rescue crews could be seen digging through the debris and brought in at least two pieces of heavy machinery to help move debris .
`` I 've never encountered anything like this before anytime in my life , and I do n't want to see it again , '' said Vey , who was driving down 22nd Street right before Market and saw the building come down . `` I feel really lucky . That brick landed in my passenger seat . Lucky for the rain guard on my window that saved me from getting hit . ''
Exclusive Deadly Collapse Reveals Risks of Work on Old Buildings
Ordinary people took part in the rescue efforts as well . Roofers from a nearby building hustled over after the collapse and started pulling people out of the basement .
`` They were pretty banged up , '' one of the roofers said .
Woman Pulled Alive From the Rubble

The Salvation Army sent its own disaster response team to the site to help survivors and first responders . The organization sent out a statement saying , `` Our No . 1 concern is for the safety of our customers and the employees who were involved . ''
Market Street was closed from 18th to 30th Street for most of the day but the zone was made smaller by Thursday morning as only the roads within a couple blocks of the collapse remained closed .
Watch Live Property History of Building Collapse
Fire officials say the building next door to the collapse was under demolition . According to the demolition permit from Philadelphia 's Licenses and Inspections , that building was a four-story structure . The demolition contractor is Griffin Campbell Construction .
A man , who did not want to be identified , recorded video of the demolition of the building on Sunday and sent it to NBC10.com .
Collapse Survivors ' Families Are Grateful
14 people survived Wednesday 's building collapse at 21st and Market Streets in Center City with minor injuries . NBC10 's Denise Nakano spoke to some family members , who are relieved their injures are n't serious . ( Published Thursday , June 6 , 2013 )
OSHA officials said they were aware of the incident and would be launching an investigation . The Department of Labor is also investigating .
A 59-year-old Russian cosmonaut became the world 's oldest spacewalker Friday , joining a much younger cosmonaut 's son for maintenance work outside the International Space Station .
Pavel Vinogradov , a cosmonaut for two decades , claimed the honor as they emerged from the hatch with Roman Romanenko . But they inadvertently added to the booming population of space junk when they lost their grip on an experiment tray that they were retrieving toward the end of the 6 1/2-hour spacewalk .
The lost aluminum panel -- 18 inches by 12 inches and about 6 1/2 pounds -- contained metal samples . Scientists wanted to see how the samples had fared after a year out in the vacuum of space .
Otherwise , the spacewalk had gone well , with the spacewalkers installing new science equipment and replacing a navigation device needed for the June arrival of a European cargo ship .
Collecting the experiment tray was Vinogradov 's last task outside .
The tray drifted toward the solar panels of the main Russian space station compartment , called Zvezda , Russian for Star . Flight controllers did not believe it struck anything , and the object was not thought to pose a safety hazard in the hours and days ahead .
`` That 's unfortunate , '' someone radioed in Russian .
Another panel of similar experiments will be collected on a future spacewalk .
This is the first of eight spacewalks to be conducted this year , most of them by Russians . Two will be led by NASA this summer .
Until Friday , the oldest spacewalker was retired NASA astronaut Story Musgrave , who was 58 when they helped fix the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993 .
Romanenko , 41 , is a second-generation spaceman who 's following in their father 's bootsteps . Retired cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko performed spacewalks back in the 1970s and 1980s . This is the son 's first experience out in the vacuum of space .
Vinogradov made their seventh spacewalk ; they ventured into a dark , ruptured chamber at Russia 's old Mir space station in 1997 following a cargo ship collision . They arrived late last month for a six-month stay at the space station ; he 'll turn 60 aboard the orbiting complex in August .
The spacewalkers joked as they toiled 260 miles above the planet .
`` I 'm afraid of the darkness , '' one of them said in Russian as the space station passed over the night side of Earth .
Russian flight controllers outside Moscow oversaw Friday 's action . The four other space station residents monitored the activity from inside ; Canadian commander Chris Hadfield drew the short straw and had to work on a balky toilet .
PAUL Gallen has called on Cronulla to consider bringing in a new coach for the remainder of the season after the Sharks skipper admitted players were not giving 100 per cent for current coach Peter Sharp .
Cronulla captured an unwanted piece of rugby league history on Saturday night when they became the first NRL team to register three consecutive defeats without scoring a point .
The experienced and widely respected Sharp was forced to take over this season after Shane Flanagan was suspended by the NRL in the wake of the 2011 supplements program .
But Sharp has said all along that they do n't want the top job — and Gallen conceded that attitude was rubbing off on the players .
While Gallen said they sympathised with Sharp , they added they would support any move that would help the last placed team avoid the dreaded wooden spoon .
media_camera Paul Gallen of the Sharks .
“ I do n't want to sit here and bag Sharpie but Sharpie has just been thrown in the deep end , ” Gallen told Triple M .
“ He came out day one and said they did n't want the job . To me players are like school kids . If you can get away with a little bit you are going to get away with it .
“ If you know you can turn up Monday and the coach is n't going to rouse on you for not having a good game , I do n't think you are going to put 100 per cent in .
“ And I think that has been the problem throughout the whole year .
media_camera Sharks coach Peter Sharp .
“ I do n't think players have been putting in 100 per cent because they are under the impression that Sharpie is n't putting in 100 per cent .
“ I just think we have lacked direction . We have had a lot of injuries and when you get stuck in that rut it is really , really hard to get out of it . ”
Asked if it was too late for the club to appoint a new coach — perhaps a young coach from the Holden Cup competition looking for an opportunity to prove themselves — Gallen said : “ It has been spoken about but it has n't come . I know one person I have spoken to and asked about is Brett Kimmorley but they are still down in Canberra and the club have decided against it .
“ I do n't think it is too late because there is still 10 games to go and I do n't want to win the wooden spoon .
“ I have never won a wooden spoon . Like I said , there are 10 games to go . I want to get something out of the season . I want to win some games . I do n't know if it is an option or not .
“ I am willing to do whatever it takes to win some games , I really am . ”
Flanagan is set to return to the Sharks at the end of the season after agreeing to an extended deal this year but another name that has been tossed up as a possible interim coach is former Cronulla captain Trent Barrett .

As most know , I have an insane sweet tooth . Well , teeth . I just love sweets ! Sometimes , though , I 'm looking for something less heavy and more fresh than a decadent rich chocolate something-or-other . These lemon bars are the perfect amount of tart and sweet , do n't overwhelm you after one bite ( as some super rich things can ) , and are – as most of my recipes tend to be – easy and fun to do !
A few quick notes before we begin , however .
First – zest ! Long live the zest ! If you 're thinking of making these , and all you have in your house is one of those giant Costco-sized bottles of lemon juice , you absolutely can ! BUT – the zest is where the real TRUE lemony flavor comes out . It gives it that punch that is just ridiculously good . So if you do n't have lemons on hand , you can still make these ! – but do yourself and your mouth a favor and go and buy a few lemons ( 4-6 ) . It really does make a difference .
Second – Mistakes happen . As you 'll see further down , I made a whoopsie tonight . Luckily I did n't use all my lemons , and after stewing on the couch for 40 minutes I decided that these lemons were NOT going to best me ( several other choice words may have been used ) . Cooking has much more leeway than baking . I had added some more lemon juice and zest as Dave and I like them a bit more tart , and figured I 'd have to add some more flour to compensate for the extra fluid . While correct , I added FAR too much flour , and as you 'll see , it kind of turned into a lemon bar…quiche . Or something firm and partly eggy . I also think I over baked it . * * Second batch turned out perfect ! * * We just kind of stood in the kitchen eating them 🙂
Now forwards , on to the land of lemon deliciousness ! The recipe I used ( both times ) was Ina Garten 's recipe , with a few alterations . These take about 1.5 hours total to make .
Crust Ingredients :
8oz butter
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 cups flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
Filling Ingredients :
6 large eggs
3 cups granulated sugar
2 Tablespoons grated lemon zest ( yay ! zest ! 4-6 lemons worth )
1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 cup flour
Confectioner 's sugar for dusting at the end
Let 's bake !
1 . Preheat your oven to 350F .
2 . Cream together your butter and sugar until light and fluffy .
3 . Combine the flour and salt and – slowly ! – add to the butter mixture until just combined .
4 . Dump that out on a lightly floured surface and knead into a ball . The dough will seem sticky at first – just keep working with it , no extra flour is needed . The butter will keep it from sticking too bad to the counter ( and eventually the pan . No need to PAM/spray it with anything ) .
5 . Flatten the dough with floured hands and smoosh it into a 9×13 baking pan . Make sure to go up the sides a little bit , as it will retract slightly when baking . Also grab a fork and poke a few holes in it so that it wo n't poof up ( if it does , you can always poke the bubble before adding the filling and it should settle back down ) . Bake for 15-20 minutes , or until lightly golden brown . If this finishes before you finish making the filling , just take it out and set it on a wire rack but leave the oven on . Not a problem if the crust cools a little bit .
6 . The filling is the easy part ! Whisk all ingredients ( sans confectioner 's sugar ) together . Do n't whisk too crazily though , the less foamy bubbles you get the better ( but the sugar will over everything anyways ) .
Okay so here 's where things went wonky the first time around . The initial recipe called to bake for 30-35 minutes , or until the filling was set ( if you jiggle the pan , the filling does n't jiggle back ) . I baked it for 25 minutes , which turned out ( for my oven ) to be too long . It also could have been because I chose to add an extra half cup sugar to try to offset the little bit extra lemon juice I added . For batch # 2 , I left the flour alone . Lesson learned . The filling was also much darker in color ( and no bubbles ! ) the second time around . I was too busy being frustrated to take pictures though . Whoops . So – bake for 20-25 minutes . You can even start checking around the 18ish minute mark if you want .
Now just wait for them to cool , cut , and sprinkle with powdered sugar !
Here 's what can happen when you get the ratios wrong and accidentally over bake : firm lemon bar weirdness . Tastes like disappointment and frustration .
And then after pouting on the couch and decided lemons would not best me this day ( ! ) , I made a half batch with what I had left . Success !
Now go make some of your own !
Apple 's data center operations in Reno , Nev. , continue to expand , with the company now pursuing an additional 375,000 square feet of space to power its iCloud services , AppleInsider has learned .
A permit for the `` Project Isabel '' expansion was submitted on Feb. 2 and immediately withdrawn , but not before the filing could be captured by BuildZoom . In it , Apple revealed it hopes to build 8 clusters of buildings with a total square footage of 372,893.The project is valued at $ 50.7 million , and also includes the buildout of an administration building , garage building , and generator yard.The permit was submitted by contractor FCI Group , on behalf of client Apple.Apple previously received a permit for the same property for commercial contracting . And though the latest permit for the $ 51 million Project Isabel has been withdrawn , BuildZoom revealed to AppleInsider that the filing notes the permit will be resubmitted.The property in question is located on the same parcel of land as Apple 's other data center operations . Just over a year ago , Apple filed for another expansion in Reno , a project that was dubbed `` Project Huckleberry . '' Before Project Huckleberry , Apple 's operations comprised 14 buildings and 412,000 square feet . The Reno Technology Park site is a 345-acre plot of land 15 minutes east of downtown Reno.The iCloud operator is also planning to open a 200-megawatt solar farm to power its Reno facility by early 2019 Apple 's Reno data center supports various cloud platforms , including Siri , FaceTime , and iMessages .
Rep. Tom Cole ( R-Okla. ) on Friday called for President Trump to apologize to former President Obama for accusing them of `` wiretapping '' Trump Tower without evidence .
`` I see no indication that 's true . It 's not a charge that I would ever have made , and frankly unless they can produce some pretty compelling proof , then I think President Obama is owed an apology in that regard , '' Cole said .
`` If they did n't do it , we should n't be reckless in accusations that they did . ''

Cole is the first GOP lawmaker to call for an apology , although other Republicans have questioned the appropriateness of Trump 's unfounded accusation .
White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Thursday defended Trump , saying : `` The president has already been very clear that they did n't mean specifically wiretapping . They had it in quotes . So I think to fall back on that is a false premise . That 's not what they said . They were very clear when they talked about it yesterday . ''
Spicer said Trump stood by their claim , though the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier Thursday said it sees `` no indication that Trump Tower was a subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election day 2016 . ''
Trump earlier this month wrote in a series of early-morning tweets that Obama had `` my 'wires tapped ' in Trump Tower '' during the campaign , calling their predecessor a `` bad ( or sick ) guy ! ''
A formidable presence for Australia at the FIFA Confederations Cup before suffering a hamstring injury as the Socceroos bowed out after a stirring 1-1 draw with Chile , Sainsbury left Russia with their reputation much enhanced .
Sources in Japan have revealed that the 25-year-old defender is seen by Urawa 's Serbian coach Mihailo Petrovic as a prime target for the 2016 J1 League runners-up , who sit eighth on the ladder after 18 rounds .
The 2007 AFC Champions League winners , who regularly attract crowds approaching 40,000 to Saitama Stadium , last won a J.League title in 2006 , and have been five-time runners-up .
Urawa was also once home to Sainsbury 's Socceroos teammate Matthew Spiranovic , who made 38 appearances between 2010-2012 .
While publicly committed to Jiangsu , where their contract has 18 months to run , Sainsbury is looking to play regular football again after their loan spell from Jiangsu to Inter Milan yielded just a 20-minute cameo off the bench in the final Serie A game of the season .
Though Jiangsu have a new coach in Fabio Capello , the new CSL rules limiting three starting spots to foreign signings for each match appears to hinder Sainsbury 's prospects of breaking back into a team they made 29 league appearances for in their debut season .
Sainsbury 's agent Tony Rallis , who expects them to be fit again within three weeks , reiterated that they remain under contract at Jiangsu , and it 's they who will determine whether they stay or goes .
`` There 's nothing you can do about it . Before they left China ( for Italy ) he 'd play every game , '' said Rallis .
`` There 's this fascination about why he 's in China but the simple facts are it 's down to the financial resources of the Chinese .
`` And in their position he 's been playing against some of the very best in the world ( when in China ) .
`` He was wanted back in China by their club as soon as the Serie A finished but had to go to the Confederations Cup . ''
Last year 's runners-up , Jiangsu are second bottom of the CSL , having amassed just 10 points from 16 games .
`` Trent remains a required player at Jiangsu unless otherwise known , '' said Rallis .
Former Central Coast Mariners striker Mitch Duke ( Shimizu S-Pulse ) and Australia stopper Milos Degenek ( Yokohama F. Marinos ) currently fly the Australian flag in the J.League , with Nathan Burns released this month by FC Tokyo .
A CBS News crew decided to join apparently dozens of journalists across the country this week and purchase an AR-15 rifle on camera to show “ how easy ” it was to purchase a firearm by sending reporter Paula Reid to purchase one of these rifles , along with ammunition , from a Virginia gun shop . [ Scroll Down For Video ]
It should be noted that in all of these cases , the journalists making the purchase were all law abiding citizens , which means they easily passed the background check without delay .
Well , the experience for CBS went a little differently than the others and the producer who made the purchase could find themselves facing federal firearms charges for making a straw purchase .
According to a report by TheBlaze :
In an anti-gun segment intended to show how easy it is to purchase an AR-15 rifle , CBS reporter Paula Reid bought the firearm at SpecDive Tactical and then transferred the gun to a “ federally licensed firearms dealer ” just a few hours later .
Ryan Lamke , general manager of SpecDive , told the Washington Free Beacon Reid paid for the rifle with cash , claiming they planned to “ undergo training. ” They claimed the reporter “ refused basic , free instruction of firearms safety under the pretense that they were using the firearm for training with a NRA certified instructor . ”
“ Due to the information provided in the CBS News report filed today , I suspect Ms. Reid committed a straw purchase and procurement of a firearm under false pretenses , ” they added .
The owner of the store notified both the ATF and the state police of Reid 's actions along with their opinion that they lied on the Form 4473 and thus committed a federal crime .
Reid later tweeted that everything was above board and that they identified themselves as a reporter . However , there is no exclusion for lying on the 4473 for the press .
Sale , purchase , & transfer all legal . ID 'd myself as a @ CBSNews reporter 2x during sale ( was recorded ) & transfer . https : //t.co/ifYtFA4n8x — Paula Reid ( @ PaulaReidCBS ) June 17 , 2016
Several responses indicated that Reid should stop publicly talking about the incident and retain legal counsel .
According to Wikipedia , a straw purchase is defined as :
In the United States , a straw purchaser of a firearm at a federally licensed firearm dealership who lies about the identity of the ultimate possessor of the gun can be charged with making false statements on a federal Firearms Transaction Record . If a firearm is purchased as a gift , the transaction is not a straw purchase , and the person buying the gift is considered the end user .
The buyer is also considered the end user if they intend to sell the firearm , as long as the initial purchase is not made at the direction of or as part of an agreement with the second , ultimate buyer . Straw purchases in lawful sales made outside of federally regulated dealerships are not subject to such rules and are legal unless the gun is used in a crime with the prior knowledge of the straw purchaser .
In a statement to the Washington Free Beacon , the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms said they were unsure if any laws had been broken . The ATF and Department of Justice has been known to prosecute straw purchase cases in the past , even in cases where the firearms and purchaser were n't associated with any other crimes .
On 27 December last year , Israel launched Operation Cast Lead in Gaza , an overwhelming exercise of military force aimed at silencing the Hamas rockets which had terrorised Israeli towns and villages . The immediate effects of the invasion are well known : 1,400 Palestinians dead , mostly civilians , with many more wounded or displaced ; 10 Israeli soldiers and three civilians killed , dozens more injured ; and thousands of families in southern Israel forced to flee to other parts of the country . The rocketfire from Gaza into Israel has slowed but has not entirely ceased . Hamas is still in power .
What is less well-known is the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza . The legacy of Operation Cast Lead is a living nightmare for one and a half million Palestinians squeezed into one of the most overcrowded and wretched stretches of land on the planet . And as Israel and Egypt maintain a near total blockade against Gaza , the misery deepens by the day .
This is not only shocking in humanitarian terms . It is not in Israel 's or Egypt 's interest , either . Confining people in abject poverty in a tiny slice of territory is a recipe for continued bitterness , fury and radicalism .
And what has the British government and the international community done to lift the blockade ? Next to nothing . Tough-sounding declarations are issued at regular intervals but little real pressure is applied . It is a scandal that the international community has sat on its hands in the face of this unfolding crisis .
No doubt the febrile sensitivities of the Middle East have deterred governments , caught between recriminations from both sides . No doubt diplomats have warned that exerting pressure on Israel and Egypt may complicate the peace process .
But surely the consequences of not lifting the blockade are far more grave ? How is the peace process served by sickness , mortality rates , mental trauma and malnutrition increasing in Gaza ? Is it not in Israel 's enlightened self-interest to relieve the humanitarian suffering ?
The peace process is in serious trouble right now . Internal Israeli politics limits any meaningful room for manoeuvre , illegal settlement activity in the West Bank continues , and leadership of the Palestinians is divided and incoherent . A two-state solution , long the accepted bedrock of any agreement , is being openly questioned .
But paralysis in the peace process can not be an excuse for the inhumane treatment of one and a half million people , the majority of them under 18 years old . No peaceful coexistence of any kind is possible as long as this act of collective confinement continues .
According to a recently leaked report by the UN office of the humanitarian co-ordinator , Gaza is undergoing `` a process of de-development , which potentially could lead to the complete breakdown of public infrastructure '' . A report released today by a group of 16 humanitarian and human rights groups further spells out the effects .
Family homes destroyed in the invasion lie as shattered as ever . The embargo on construction materials means they will stay that way . Local hospitals and clinics were left devastated by the invasion , and those suffering health problems wait longer than ever to get out of Gaza for treatment . Many have died waiting . Bed-wetting and nightmares are endemic among children .
Half of those under 30 are unemployed . These young people are trapped in a broken land with little hope of economic opportunity . The blockade 's restrictions on Gaza 's fishermen mean they can sail only three nautical miles from the coast , impoverishing their families . Meanwhile , 80m litres of raw and partially treated sewage is pumped out into the sea every day .
Most disturbingly of all , the lack of access to materials means that basic water infrastructure simply can not be repaired or improved ; 90 to 95 % of Gaza 's water fails to meet WHO standards . The extremely high nitrate level in the water supply is leaving thousands of newborn babies at risk of poisoning .
The insistence by some that aid should come into no contact whatsoever , even indirectly , with Hamas means NGOs are prevented from repairing basic water and sanitation facilities in schools .
There is a clear moral imperative for Israel and Egypt to end the blockade , as well as it being in their enlightened self-interest to change course . But if they do not do so of their own volition , it is up to the international community to persuade them otherwise .
The EU has huge economic influence over Israel , and it believes the blockade must be lifted . At the same time as exercising leverage over Hamas , it should make clear that the web of preferential agreements which now exists between the EU and Israel – from Israeli access to EU research and development funds to recently improved access for Israeli agricultural products – will be brought into question if there is no rapid progress .
Equally , the US , as by far the largest bilateral donor to Egypt , should press President Mubarak to allow in the humanitarian and reconstruction materials that are so desperately needed .
What will be the state of Gaza 's drinking water by next December ? Of the health of its children ? Of the economy ? The attitude of its people towards Egypt and Israel ? The risk of waiting another year is too great . Gordon Brown and the international community must urgently declare that enough is enough . The blockade must end .

J. Edgar Hoover 's abuse of power as FBI director led Congress and the Justice Department to put new checks on that most powerful and secretive of offices . By the time Congress finishes investigating James Comey 's role in the 2016 presidential election , those safeguards may be due for an update .
Powerful as Hoover was , even they never simultaneously investigated both major-party candidates for the presidency . Mr. Comey did , and Americans are now getting a glimpse of how much they influenced political events .
Mr. Comey 's actions in the Hillary Clinton email probe are concerning enough . They made themselves investigator , judge and jury , breaking the Justice Department 's chain of command . They publicly confirmed the investigation , violating the department 's principles . They announced they would not recommend prosecuting Mrs. Clinton , even as they publicly excoriated her—an extraordinary abuse of their megaphone . Then they rekindled the case only 11 days before the election .
An inquiry by the Senate Judiciary Committee has now shown that Mr. Comey 's investigation was a charade . They wrote a draft statement exonerating Mrs. Clinton in May , long before they bothered to interview them or their staff . This at least finally explains the probe 's lackluster nature : the absence of a grand jury , the failure to follow up on likely perjury , the unorthodox immunity deals made with Clinton aides .
But the big development this week is a new look at how Mr. Comey may have similarly juked the probe into Donald Trump 's purported ties to Russia . The House Intelligence Committee 's investigation took a sharp and notable turn on Tuesday , as news broke that it had subpoenaed the FBI and the Justice Department for information relating to the infamous Trump “ dossier. ” That dossier , whose allegations appear to have been fabricated , was commissioned by the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS and then developed by a former British spook named Christopher Steele .

But the FBI had its own part in this dossier , and investigators are finally drilling down into how big a role it played , and why . The bureau has furiously resisted answering questions . It ignored the initial requests for documents and has refused to comply with the House committee 's subpoenas , which were first issued Aug. 24 . Republicans are frustrated enough that this week they sent orders compelling FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appear before the committee to explain the obstruction .
One explanation is that the documents might show the FBI played a central role in ginning up the fake dossier on Mr. Trump . To this day , we do not know who hired Fusion GPS to gather the dirt . The New York Times early this year reported , citing an anonymous source , that a wealthy anti-Trumper initially hired Fusion to dig into Mr. Trump 's business dealings , but the contract was later taken over by a Clinton-allied group . That 's when Fusion shifted its focus to Russia and hired Mr. Steele .
The question is when the FBI got in on the act . The Washington Post in February reported that Mr. Steele “ was familiar ” to the FBI , since he 'd worked for the bureau before . The newspaper said Mr. Steele had reached out to a “ friend ” at the FBI about their Trump work as far back as July 2016 . The Post even reported that Mr. Steele “ reached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay them to continue their work . ”
Who was Mr. Steele 's friend at the FBI ? Did the bureau influence the direction of the Trump dossier ? Did it give Mr. Steele material support from the start ? The timing matters because it could answer the vital question of why the FBI wanted the dossier . Here 's one thought : warrants .
Advertisement
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , which oversees spying activities , is usually generous in approving warrants , on the presumption law-enforcement agencies are acting in good faith . When a warrant is rejected , though , law enforcement is n't pleased .
Perhaps the FBI wanted to conduct surveillance on someone connected to a presidential campaign ( Carter Page ? ) but could n't hit what was—and ought to be—a supremely high bar for getting such a potentially explosive warrant . A dossier of nefarious allegations might well prove handy in finally convincing the FISA court to sign off . The FBI might have had a real motive to support Mr. Steele 's effort . It might have even justified the unjustifiable : working with a partisan oppo-research firm and a former spook to engineer a Kremlin-planted dossier that has roiled Mr. Trump 's entire presidency .
Now that 's power .
Mr. Comey 's meddling has never seemed to stem from some hidden partisan impulse , but rather from an overweening self-righteousness . But power can be misused as much in the hands of the sanctimonious as the corrupt . And it 's overdue for congressional investigators to get to the bottom of precisely how much power Mr. Comey was exercising .

What is BOINC ?
BOINC ( Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing ) is an open-source volunteer oriented computing grid that combines the processing power of all individual users for the purposes of scientific research .
Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing ( BOINC ) is an open-source middleware system which supports volunteer and grid computing . Originally developed to support the SETI @ home project , it became generalized as a platform for other distributed applications in areas as diverse as mathematics , linguistics , medicine , molecular biology , climatology , environmental science , and astrophysics , among others . BOINC aims to enable researchers to tap into the enormous processing resources of multiple personal computers around the world .
What are some examples of existing BOINC projects ?
World Community Grid : Attempting to solve Cancer , Ebola , Malaria , Zika , etc
SETI @ Home : Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( SETI )
GPUGRID : Full-atom molecular simulations of proteins
Asteroids @ home : Asteroid research - it uses photometric measurements of asteroids observed by professional big all-sky surveys as well as 'backyard ' astronomers . The data is processed using the lightcurve inversion method and a 3D shape model of an asteroid together with the rotation period and the direction of the spin axis are derived .
Milkyway @ home : Creation of a 3d map of the milkyway galaxy using data gathered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey . This project enables research in both astroinformatics and computer science .

Can I create an BOINC project ?
Anyone can create a BOINC project , there 's no centralised authority that you are required to consult before creating a BOINC project .
If you 've got an idea for a distributed computing project , head on over to the BOINC project brainstorming thread on STEEM to get an idea of possible BOINC projects .
What 's this talk of a whitelist ?
The BOINC project whitelist is a voted upon list of projects rewarded within the Gridcoin network . We do n't reward all projects because some projects are inactive/dead or are insecure & a risk to our users .
If you have concerns regarding the whitelist or wish to have your project whitelisted then speak up in the Gridcoin whitelist thread .
Due to the nature of this BOINC project , there 's nothing stopping you from ignoring the whitelist and distributing your crypto assets against non-whitelisted projects but you do so at your own risk ( and potentially at the risk of your own crypto community ) .
What is Project Rain ?
'Project Rain ' is the practice of distributing crypto assets to BOINC users based on their verified BOINC computation ; it was initially devised within the Gridcoin network and has been expanded to multiple cryptocurrencies and all BOINC teams through this BOINC project .
Through this BOINC project , you will be able to match a user 's BOINC CPID to their multiple crypto asset addresses/accounts to which you can distribute your asset against .
Think of Project Rain as a new share-dropping vector that does n't require end-users handling wallet private keys nor providing proof of IRL identity .
What is exciting about project rain is that there are currently over 500,000 active BOINC users and 4 million total registered BOINC users to whom you could potentially distribute your choice of asset .
What cryptocurrencies are currently supported ?
Gridcoin , Bitshares , STEEM , Ethereum ( ETH ) , Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) , NXT , Ardor , Hyperledger , Waves , Omnilayer and Counterparty .
Is there a mandatory team requirement ?
There is no mandatory team requirement for joining the website . Assets may be distributed by individuals to specific teams with full freedom of choice and no site interference .
Who decides upon asset distribution details ?
The individual wishing to 'rain ' an asset is fully responsible for picking the projects and/or teams to target as well as the desired 'rain weight ' for each project . The 'Project-Rain ' BOINC project admin has no input on who/what gets 'rained ' upon ; 'project rain ' targets and asset platforms are entirely the initiators choices .
Is a fee charged for this service ?
No fees will be charged by the Project-Rain website . You 'll be likely to pay a large fee to distribute your asset on your cryptocurrency platform of choice to equate with the scale of the Project Rain distribution .
Can I contribute to the development of project-rain ?
Yes , you certainly can ! https : //github.com/grctest/project-rain-site
I would really appreciate help finishing the 'rain tutorial ' page : https : //github.com/grctest/project-rain-site/blob/master/source/rain-tutorial.html.erb ( I need specific info for how to create the equivalent of a 'sendmany ' transaction to potentially tens of thousands of BOINC users on your crypto network platform ) .
I would also appreciate input on address validation for the planned supported cryptocurrencies .

A 24-year-old man is suspected of killing their girlfriend and leaving their body in barrel inside their Harlem apartment for several days , a law enforcement source said . ( Published Monday , March 4 , 2013 )
A 24-year-old man is suspected of stabbing their girlfriend to death and leaving their body in a 55-gallon barrel inside their Harlem apartment for several days , the medical examiner said .
Police responded to a call about a foul smell coming from the apartment on 140th Street and Seventh Avenue and discovered the woman 's body inside the container .
The woman had been stabbed multiple times in the torso , the medical examiner said . Them identity has yet to be released .
According to the law enforcement source , the woman was planning on leaving their boyfriend to move to the Dominican Republic .
Them boyfriend is in custody at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital under psychiatric care . Police believe the woman may have been dead since Wednesday .
The typical U.S. historical marker , cast iron with raised lettering , usually raises more questions than it answers , and many of these signs are rife with errors and bias . Artist Norm Magnusson 's I-75 Project uses the form for a different sort of provocation .
Magnusson hopes to install these signs at rest stops along the 1,775-mile Insterstate 75 , which stretches from Michigan to Florida . They have already shown them in several states and is seeking funding for the proposed installation . Thick Culture quotes them on their sly , Zinn-meets-Banksy appeal :
“ ‘ Are they real ? ' is a question viewers frequently ask , meaning ‘ are they state-sponsored ? ' I love this confusion and hope to slip a message in while people are mulling it over . These markers are just the kind of public art I really enjoy : gently assertive and non-confrontational , firmly thought-provoking and pretty to look at and just a little bit subversive . ”

Survivors of sexual assault at Dalhousie may only have until November 3 to call the university 's helpline .
The Dalhousie Student Union says right now it can only offer the sexual assault and harassment phone line service for the first eight weeks of classes after being offered inadequate funding from the university 's administration .
Students at Dalhousie started the phone line for survivors of sexual assault last September—a 24-hour service offering support and information for students affected by sexualized or gender-based violence . It began as a pilot project funded primarily through the DSU and community groups . Dalhousie eventually offered $ 22,500 in funding to see the project through until April .
The service was put on hold this summer as the DSU requested a full $ 60,000 operational costs in funding for the upcoming school year . Rhiannon Makohoniuk , DSU vice president internal , says the group also presented Dal with a bare minimum request of $ 30,000 to allow the service to continue . Makohoniuk claims the university returned with an offer of $ 15,000 in new funding . The DSU turned that money down .
“ If we took the money , it would mean we would n't be able to hold them to account , ” they say .
“ This is something that we really wanted to partner with the university on . This is something that the students and administration should be working together on , and it 's really unfortunate that they decided to underfund and not support this project . ”
Janet Bryson , senior communications manager at Dalhousie , writes via email that “ after reviewing the actuals of the operating costs of the hotline and considering the results of a report of usage and successes/challenges , the university agreed to renew funding at the same level as the previous year ( one half of the $ 45,000 expense to operate ) , for one more year . ”
That $ 22,500 includes $ 7,500 in funds from the original request last year , and $ 15,000 offered in new funding .
Makohoniuk could n't provide figures on how many calls the helpline took last year , but says its importance to Dalhousie is n't solely measured by those numbers .
“ It 's measured by training over 100 people on campus in things like active listening and responding to sexualized violence , ” they say . “ It 's in promoting a culture of consent on campus , and raising consciousness and capacity on campus , for things like combating rape culture and combating sexualized violence . ”
This news comes at a time where students and faculty are voicing outrage at the university 's choice to foot the $ 300,000 ( US ) bill for nine Nova Scotian business figures to participate in a Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in October .
The union has chosen to run the phone line on its own for the first eight weeks of the school year , with the help of student levy funds . It will be a “ condensed ” service , operating from noon until midnight , seven days a week and lasting from September 3 until November 3 .
This covers what Makohoniuk says is the “ the critical eight-week period at the beginning of the school year with the highest incidences of sexual assault on campus . ”
Daniel McVey posted this photo on EarthSky 's Facebook page earlier this week . It 's a gorgeous shot of the Milky Way and airglow , but Daniel did n't post it for its beauty alone . They also wanted an opportunity to talk about dark skies . You need a dark sky to see the Milky Way , and airglow , and to acquire a photo like this one . Daniel wanted to remind everyone of an upcoming event – International Dark Sky Week , which starts one week from today , April 5 – 12 , 2013 . It 's designed to raise awareness about the effects of light pollution and offer some simple ways to use light responsibly .
Click here for IDS Week 's message and donation page .
And airglow ? Here 's Daniel 's explanation from their blog :
What is airglow ? When oxygen particles high in our atmosphere interact with sunlight , they become excited or ionized during the day . At night , as the particles return to their normal state , they release visible light and microwaves . The green glow is produced by oxygen atoms about 60 miles ( 100 km ) high in the atmosphere . The red glow is from oxygen atoms higher than 60 miles in the atmosphere . The effect is likened to placing a glow-in-the-dark sticker under a lamp for several minutes then turning the lamp off to witness the glow from the sticker . Airglow is a signature of a dark sky .

Industry says city is dragging its feet on recreational pot
If you go What : Public hearing on new marijuana ordinances When : 5 p.m. Tuesday Where : Council Chambers , Boulder Municipal Building , 1777 Broadway
Under Amendment 64 , Coloradans will be able to buy recreational marijuana Jan. 1 , but under proposed Boulder ordinance changes , those who do n't already have existing medical marijuana shops may not be able to open their own outlets until almost a year later .
And initially , recreational pot consumers will have to do their shopping outside of city limits .
That has some in the industry complaining that the city is stubbornly dragging its feet .
Boulder City Council will hold a public hearing and a second reading of the new set of ordinances that would govern the sale of recreational marijuana in the city Tuesday .
Under the proposed rules , existing medical marijuana dispensaries would be able to apply convert to recreational marijuana facilities months before new businesses can apply to sell recreational marijuana .
The city said allowing existing medical marijuana dispensaries to be the first to convert and sell recreational marijuana makes sense , since those business owners have already satisfied the regulations associated with having medical marijuana licenses without issues .
`` They have been good businesses and followed through with requirements of the city and been responsible , '' said Assistant City Attorney Kathy Haddock .
The proposed timeline right now would have the city stop accepting medical marijuana applications in March , to allow the city time to finish processing both renewals and new applications . On June 1 , the city would begin accepting applications by those medical marijuana dispensaries to convert to recreational shops .
The city would only begin opening up applications to new recreational marijuana businesses in October 2014 .
As a result , Boulder 's licensing clerk Mishawn Cook said the city has seen an increase in applications and renewals for medical marijuana licenses , as those looking to avoid a longer wait seek to get in under the deadline . They said they expect more in the coming months .
Currently , Boulder has 39 pending applications , with 13 of those being for new medical marijuana licenses .
`` We expect we will see another little blip as owners are trying to make plans to properly position their businesses for the transition , '' Cook said .
'We 've been through this '
David Threlfall , the owner of Trill Alternatives , 1537 Pearl St. , said at the moment they are leaning toward keeping their business a medical marijuana dispensary , as opposed to transitioning into a recreational shop . But they said it does make sense that dispensaries should get the first shot at opening recreational stores .
`` I think that 's a great decision , '' they said . `` The last thing they want to do is start with everybody being new . We 've been through this . We 've been through it and sat down with Mishawn Cook before . We know what they want and we know what 's expected of us . ''
Cook said they do n't anticipate too many issues with converting existing licenses .
`` We expect and hope that recreational marijuana conversations will be pretty straight forward in the sense that they are already existing businesses , '' they said . `` Overall they 're very good licensees and now they 've been operating for nearly three years in a compliant manner . ''
Added Threlfall , `` Anybody who has survived in this business this long , you 've had to jump through a lot of hoops . A few more is not something that would keep me from doing this . ''
'Not acceptable
But Shawn Coleman , a consultant who works on behalf of the marijuana industry , said the Boulder needs to move faster on opening recreational marijuana shops in the city . They pointed out that the city of Denver anticipates having recreational retailers open in January -- well ahead of Boulder .
`` The idea that the city of Denver will do this but the city of Boulder would n't be able to handle 39 applications until June of next year , I struggle to understand the logic of that , '' Coleman said .
`` Boulder has been extremely effective at regulating marijuana . I do n't quite understand why staff seems to have such low confidence in doing what they 've been doing so successfully for the past three years . ''
Coleman said the lag will put marijuana businesses that have chosen to set up shop in Boulder behind , at cost to both businesses and the city .
`` If I 'm an adult who wants to buy recreational marijuana on January 1 , I 'm not going to just buy marijuana , '' they said . `` I 'm going to get a bite to eat , I might see a show . And all that is transported from would have been taking place in Boulder down to Denver .
`` The longer that goes on , the greater the risk for places that have made a commitment to Boulder , '' they said .
The city said it needs the time because the licensing office -- in addition to processing medical marijuana applications -- will have to be writing up a new application for recreational marijuana while still carrying out the normal duties of its office . Cook also said even if they could hire and train more staff , other departments they work with on licensing issues wo n't do the same .
`` We do n't anticipate our partner departments will have additional staff devoted to this alone , and we work very closely with other departments , '' Cook said . `` We just do n't anticipate that those other departments will have the additional staffing , and we at city licensing do a myriad of other things . ''
In addition , Boulder also does not want any new recreational marijuana applications until June because of a legislative error this year that prevents cities from obtaining access to background checks done by the state on applicants . But the city said the author of the bill acknowledged the omission and plans on correcting it by June .
In the meantime , Boulder can move forward converting medical marijuana licenses because those applicants have already gone through background checks .
`` One reason we can do it before we get the background checks is that it 's just a conversion , '' Haddock said . `` They 've already had checks done . ''
In a memo to city council , staff said it could possibly speed things up by halting medical marijuana applications in November and starting the conversions in January , but added that would put a strain on the licensing office .
Coleman , however , said none of the city 's reasons for delaying the conversions are logical and compared the delay to the recent federal government shutdown . They said the city was simply dragging its feet , hoping that delay would help to stop the recreational marijuana movement .
`` That is the motivation here , '' they said . `` They do n't want recreational marijuana so they are going to delay it as long as possible . January 2 , that 's acceptable but not ideal . But June , that 's not acceptable . ''

Tabletop role playing games often take cues from common mythology . These games give a chance for players and Game Masters to remix common stories with modern twists and explore lesser known myths more completely . The myth of Bluebeard is one such tale that 's been explored in film , TV , opera and ballet . The Bluebeard 's Bride RPG , currently on Kickstarter , offers a brand-new way to explore this old spooky story .
The bones of the story are fairly common : A young woman is promised to an older , uglier , powerful man called Bluebeard because of the strange color of their facial hair . Bluebeard is called away on business on their wedding night . They give their bride the keys to their massive manor to allow them to explore their new home , but they forbid them to enter one single room in the house . The bride 's curiosity eventually overtakes them and when they open up the locked room , they find the bodies of all the other brides Bluebeard took—and murdered—before them The story resonates with other common myths like Pandora 's Box and Eve taking the apple in the Garden of Eden .
“ There are many endings to the tale , ” said Marissa Kelly of Magpie Games , “ but the one that resonates strongest with me is the one where they venture into the final room , Bluebeard catches her , and no one is there to save them They are alone in facing their punishment and no one is the wiser . The town , their family , everyone is better off maintaining the status quo of their death and turning a blind eye as the system chews them up and spits them out . ”
Kelly is the project lead , having created the game with Whitney “ Strix ” Beltrán and Sarah Richardson at a Hacking for Women event at Gen Con 2014 . The RPG uses the Powered By The Apocalypse system to let players tell their version of the story . To stay close to the original inspiration and keep the themes of isolation , everybody plays the Bride , though each player takes on the role of a different part of their psyche , pushing and pulling the Bride through the other strange rooms in their husband 's house . The simple resolution system makes this an excellent choice for people that have never played a game before , and many of the moves require no roll at all , hearkening back to time when ghost stories were told around the firelight .
“ I think having all the players acting as one character is a really fun gateway to stories like Bluebeard 's Bride about the journey of a single protagonist that other [ Powered By The Apocalypse ] games do n't really explore in the same way , ” said Kelly .
The Kickstarter offers digital and physical copies of the book , with stretch goals expanding into accessories taking advantage of the game 's evocative art . “ As a team we had focused on how the game should reflect some of the Turkish roots we loved about the evolution of the story , while giving into some more modernly gothic tones . After that , it was my job as art director to find an art style that could bring our vision ( as grand as it was ) to life , ” said Kelly .
“ I needed shadows , blues , golds , and a splash of red , but it is a little hard to describe my process for finding artists in words . I looked for artists who could invoke rich emotion as well as could capture raw feminine beauty and horror . ”
Backers have opened up play aids such as books featuring different rooms , playsets allowing for the same tale to be told in different settings and decks featuring cards with objects , servants , and other prompts to help keep play moving forward .
The Kickstarter ends on November 20th and features playable materials for backers who want to try the game right away . Halloween may have come and gone this year but there 's always time for a ghost story well-told by friends .

NEW DELHI ( Thomson Reuters Foundation ) - A young Indian woman has admitted murdering their father as they slept by cutting open their chest and removing their pacemaker , saying they had raped them for years and they were too scared of them to go to the police , the Times of India reported on Tuesday .
The 23-year-old woman enlisted two male friends to help bludgeon their father to death with a wooden cricket stump before tearing open their chest with a piece of glass and removing the pacemaker , according to the report .
`` She alleged their father made physical advances towards them and exploited them If they objected , they were beaten up and threatened . They also did not allow them to meet their boyfriend . Finally , they made up their mind to get rid of him , '' said Additional Commissioner of Police for West Delhi Ranvir Singh .
Police have arrested the woman and two men and recovered a blood stained cricket stump , cable , knife , glass shards and car , they said .
The woman said their father started abusing them after their mother died three years ago , according to the report .

Canada 's largest airline did not show well in a recent poll ranking passenger satisfaction among North American airlines .
In the new study released by J.D . Power , Air Canada was ranked dead last .
According to consumer insights , Air Canada falls behind the four other traditional carriers , specifically Alaska Airlines , Delta Air Lines , American Airlines , and even United Airlines .
Measures for the performance satisfaction analysis included cost and fees , in-flight services , aircraft , boarding and deplaning , baggage care , flight crew , check-in , and reservation .
Despite recent highly publicized incidents , J.D . Power says overall satisfaction is on the upward trend due to lower costs , improved on-time performance , fewer lost bags , and improved satisfaction with flight crews . As well , instances of denial of boarding or bumping to another flight have reached historic lows in frequency .
“ It 's impossible to think about airline customer satisfaction without replaying the recent images of a passenger being dragged from a seat , but our data shows that , as a whole , the airline industry has been making marked improvements in customer satisfaction across a variety of metrics , from ticket cost to flight crew , ” said Michael Taylor , travel practice lead at J.D . Power , in a statement .
“ As recent events remind us , however , airlines have significant room for improvement . Airlines still rank among the bottom tier of most service industries tracked by J.D . Power , far lower than North American rental car companies or hotels . ”
J.D . Power conducted a survey for low-cost carriers as well .

Trek Wars : Revival is a mod by Captain Kavok that lets you add Star Trek factions to Empire at War , Petroglyph 's excellent Star Wars RTS . So if you 've ever wondered if a fleet of Galaxy-class Federation starships could take down a Star Destroyer—and , honestly , who hasn't—you can play that scenario out in the game 's fast-paced skirmish mode . The perfect opportunity , I thought , to pit a selection of iconic Star Wars and Star Trek factions against each other in a series of epic space battles .
United Federation of Planets versus Rebel Alliance
Our first battle takes place above the desert planet of Tatooine . I begin by sending my shuttles to capture two nearby asteroids so I can generate credits . Doing so as early as possible is key to victory in Empire at War 's skirmish mode . The Rebels send a small team of X-wing scouts into my territory , but my station 's automated defences chase them away . When I have enough credits , I build a couple of Miranda-class starships to protect my asteroids . Growing bolder , the Rebels send in more X-wings , but I swat them away easily .
I spend a chunk of my income on upgrading my base , which unlocks my first hero unit : Captain Kathryn Janeway , commanding the Intrepid-class USS Voyager . This was , of course , the first Federation starship to successfully explore the Delta Quadrant . The Rebels send in an assault frigate to attack one of my asteroid mines and I send Janeway to intercept . Then another handful of frigates appear near my base . The Rebels have mobilised an impressive strike force , and I 'm lagging behind . A huge battle breaks out and I upgrade my base as it rages , bringing in Captain Benjamin Sisko of the USS Defiant—the ship the Federation designed to fight the Borg .
It 's here where I make my biggest mistake . I build three Galaxy-class starships and try and sneak them through the battle to attack the Rebel base directly . But it 's surrounded by laser defence satellites and they obliterate my ships before I can get close . A costly error . Then the Rebels send in their own hero unit : Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon . Sisko and Solo engage in a dramatic dogfight , but the Defiant is beaten . Then the Voyager is scuttled by the mass of Mon Calamari cruisers looming near my base . Things really could n't have gone worse . I accept defeat and watch helplessly as the cruisers pummel my HQ with laser fire . An embarrassing loss .
Galactic Empire versus Klingon Empire
The ice planet Hoth provides the setting for this battle . Immediately , it 's clear that luck is not on my side . There 's one asteroid beside my base , but the next nearest is in the lower corner of the map . This makes it harder to defend . I kick things off by hiring the legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett and their ship , Slave I , to protect my station while my TIE fighters make sure no one tries to sabotage my mining operations . The Klingons , bizarrely , are not as aggressive as the Rebels . They have n't attacked once . I utilise this quiet time to upgrade my base and build a fleet of three Acclamator-class assault ships . I also research reinforced armour to give them a defensive boost , which I 'll probably need later .
Then things kick off . The Klingons send in a swarm of D7-class warships to hassle me , but Fett and an accompanying wing of TIE fighters make short work of them . More Klingon ships arrive , including a mighty Bird-of-Prey . I build a dozen wings of TIE interceptors to deal with them , while I sneak my Acclamators behind enemy lines . Yes , it 's the same tactic I tried previously , but it 'll work this time . The Klingons send a few B'rel-class ships to stop me , but they 're no match for my armoured frigates . I reach the heavily defended Klingon base and begin my attack . I make a significant dent , but my Acclamators are being pulverised in the process .
Time to bring out the big guns . I spend the bulk of my remaining credits to call in Grand Admiral Thrawn and their flagship , a colossal Star Destroyer called the Admonitor . My Acclamators are beaten , but before the Klingons can catch a breath Thrawn comes roaring in accompanied by Darth Vader and a wing of TIE interceptors . My own base is taking heavy damage , but I 'm certain I can destroy the enemy first . I send every available unit , including Boba Fett and the rest of my home defence force , to attack the Klingon HQ and soon the station falls . A great victory for the Empire .
Romulan Star Empire versus Rebel Alliance
Above the planet Naboo the next battle begins . I send my Talon-class scout ships to scope out nearby asteroids , one of which is already contested . A brief skirmish breaks out between my ships and a squadron of X-wings , but I win and claim the rock as my own . I spend my first trickle of credits on a couple of Hawk-class cruisers , the kind the Romulans used to patrol the Neutral Zone back in their own universe . As usual , the Rebels send in a few X-wings to scout my territory , but they 're easily dealt with .
I recruit Romulan hero Tomalak , commander of the Deranas , a D'deridex-class battlecruiser . This thing is enormous , and suddenly I feel unbeatable . The Rebels begin to throw frigates at me , but my upgraded base 's defences and Buzzard-class cruisers are doing a good job of keeping them at bay . While they 're distracted there I collect the rest of my fleet together . I recruit another hero , Sela , who TNG fans will know is the daughter of an alternate universe Tasha Yar . They command another huge Warbird , making my fleet look nicely intimidating . It 's time for an assault .
I send scout ships ahead to locate the Rebel base . While I do so , Han Solo and a squadron of X-wings attack my fleet . Solo puts up a good fight , and manages to drop the shield of Sela 's ship , but the sheer power of my armada is too much . The Falcon explodes dramatically as my scouts reveal the enemy base , setting the stage for the final assault . I move every ship I have towards the Rebel station . It puts up a fight , but it has n't been upgraded much and in minutes it 's falling apart and spewing flames . I watch as my Warbirds tear the base apart and earn a glorious victory for the Romulans .
United Federation of Planets versus Galactic Empire
Coruscant , capital of the galaxy , is where the final skirmish will take place . I kick off as usual by sending shuttle scouts out to set up mining facilities on asteroids . I grab a few on the edges of the map , but in the centre I see a tantalising trio of rocks in close proximity . I send a Miranda-class ship in to investigate , but the Empire already has firm control of it . That 's serious cashflow for them , and bad news for me . So I decide to switch up my tactics and try something new . I focus entirely on base upgrades until I 'm able to build Galaxy-class ships , then I begin creating my armada .
I do n't bother with upgrades or anything else . I just keep building Galaxy-class starships . Every time I reach 4,000 credits I build one , and repeat . After about ten minutes I 'm commanding seven of the beasts , each of which has its own squadron of shuttle fighters . And now it 's time for a bit of shock and awe . I recruit Federation hero Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise-E who leads my fleet of Galaxies towards the enemy base . The Galactic Empire sends a cluster of Star Destroyers after me , and a thrilling conflict breaks out . Lasers and phasers crisscross the battlefield as the Destroyers and Galaxies trade blows and swarms of smaller fighters dogfight around them . It 's terribly exciting .
Two of my Galaxies sacrifice themselves for the cause , bursting into flames and exploding against the stars . Picard survives the ambush and takes the lead once again . I push forward through the front line towards the Imperial base . Laser defence satellites cause me some problems and drop a few of my ships ' shields , but I reach the station and begin an all-out assault . The sight of my ships circling the Empire 's base and pummelling it with photon torpedoes is a beautiful one , and eventually it begins to break apart . I can just picture Picard on the bridge , calmly asking for a damage report , secretly celebrating a successful mission . A solid win for the Federation .
The results
Well , I was going to use the results of these battles to determine if Star Wars or Star Trek was the better space-faring franchise . But in the end it was a draw : two wins for Star Wars , two wins for Star Trek . And there 's something beautiful about that . I 'm not sure what exactly drives Empire at War 's fairly unpredictable skirmish AI , but it was a lot more aggressive in the first fight , utterly mauling me with a huge armada—and this was only on medium difficulty .
This is a fantastic mod with an impressive attention to detail . I love how it changes the HUD to look like Star Trek 's LCARS computer interface . And the sound effects , especially the Federation 's phasers and photon torpedoes , are spot on . If you want to give it a go yourself , search for Trek Wars : Revival on Mod DB . There 's just something fundamentally entertaining about watching iconic ships from these two series fight each other , trading blows in the infinite vacuum of space .
It might sound goofy to toss around the term `` killer app , '' but screw it -- LittleBigPlanet PS Vita is the PlayStation Vita 's killer app . Let 's start at the top : it 's the best LittleBigPlanet game yet , and it 's not even from the folks that created the franchise . LBP PS Vita takes the platforming we all know and love and tosses in Vita touch functionality that makes sense and is actually engaging to use . Then , it takes the ability to create games and makes it even better by allowing creators to give players the ability to save progress -- so now lenghty RPGs are a reality . Of course , making and sharing all these levels remains free , and then there 's the ability to play through levels with online friends . Oh , and all the DLC from other LBP games works here . Ahem , this is the fattest , bang for your buck game on the PlayStation Vita , and that 's why LittleBigPlanet PS Vita is the IGN Vita Game of the Year . There 's an endless stream of content , and it 's awesome .
“ It 's the biggest selfie-generating show I 've ever seen , ” said docent Alexa West , standing at New York 's David Zwirner Gallery on Tuesday afternoon , in a show devoted to reflective works by De Wain Valentine ( b . 1936 ) .
Zwirner has taken the rare step for a commercial gallery of stationing docents at its 19th Street venue ; they talk to visitors about the exhibition while reminding them not to touch the fragile works or to draw too near as they explore the show 's selfie potential .
“ People want to get as close as possible , so we 're part informational , part security , ” said a bespectacled Daniel Pillis , an MFA candidate at Carnegie Mellon who was sporting a necktie .
West is an art student at Cooper Union . They 're hardly the proper elderly women you might think of when you hear the word “ docent . ”
Zwirner has mounted a lot of highly photogenic shows that have spawned thousands of visitor self-portraits—two exhibitions by Yayoi Kusama in the last two years , and , in 2014 , Jordan Wolfson 's show featuring an animatronic dancer in front of a mirror , the ultimate provocation to get out your iPhone .
The Valentine show includes nearly two dozen sculptures by the Colorado-born California Light and Space artist , made in a polyester resin that the artist developed himself . Existing varieties of resin could n't be cast at more than 50 pounds , as they were prone to cracking . Working with a scientist , Valentine developed a more durable brand that 's now known as Valentine MasKast Resin .
Perhaps the centerpiece of the show is Two Gray Columns ( 1975–76 ) , a pair of nearly 12-foot-high walls , 7 feet wide , that taper from about 10 inches thick at the bottom , narrowing as they ascend .
“ Everyone wants to get a shot of themselves from the far side , standing between the two , ” Pillis said , gesturing toward the few inches between the sculpture 's two parts .
This is the first time the work is being shown as intended . It was commissioned for the Illinois offices of a pharmaceutical company , but was orphaned when the design of the space was altered at the last minute and became too small to accommodate them . Valentine tried showing the two parts on their sides but was n't satisfied with the result .
Other , smaller columns are exhibited a foot or two from the walls , and visitors are dying to get a picture of themselves standing behind the works , Pillis said . That 's not allowed . Anyway , when I studied the 5-foot-tall Column Flourescent Yellow ( 1968 ) close up , my impulse was more to get inside of it . “ It sucks you in , ” Pillis agreed .
Valentine told the press during a June gallery talk ( supplied to artnet News on video ) that “ these pieces grew out of when I came to California and fell in love with the sky and the ocean . They were like big pieces of atmosphere . I always wanted to have a magic solid so I could cut out a big piece of sky or a big piece of ocean . ”
Several impressive , perfectly disc-shaped sculptures in blue , red , and gold mysteriously stand on their own , without any support . One , Circle Blue Smoke Flow ( 1970 ) , distinctively features color variations that resemble wisps of smoke that refer , the artist has said , to L.A. smog .
The Zwirner outing is Valentine 's first New York solo since 1981 . “ Galleries will never show art made of plastic , ” Valentine was told in the ‘ 60s , when they started showing dealers photographs of their work .
Valentine has gained renewed attention in recent years , following their inclusion in the Getty Center 's Pacific Standard Time exhibitions , especially a solo devoted to the 1975–76 work Gray Column . That work had never before been on public view . The 1970 sculpture Red Concave Circle was recently donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art by Bank of America .
“ Richard Serra more aggressively reshaped our experience of space , ” said Pillis , referring to Valentine 's contemporary , the subject of a show at Zwirner 's 20th Street gallery , one block north . “ The Light and Space artists treated space more as a found object . ”
For those who ca n't resist their inclinations to a tactile experience of art , visitors are allowed to touch the Serra works , Pillis pointed out .
The docent job is an excellent gig , they and West agreed . “ Visitors ask questions , and that leads to more questions , and then you 're in a conversation , ” West said .
“ It 's great to get to point out how cool the work is , ” Pillis said . “ And , to let them know not to get too close . ”

Abstract : The aims of this paper are to narrate and analyze some psychological phenomena that I have perceived in dead people , including evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) in murdered people . The methodology adopted was `` projection of consciousness '' ( i.e. , a non-ordinary state of consciousness ) , which allowed me to observe , interact , and interview dead people directly as a social psychologist . This investigation was based on Cartesian skepticism , which allowed me a more critical analysis of my experiences during projection of consciousness . There is strong evidence that a dead person : ( i ) continues living , thinking , behaving after death as if he/she still has his/her body because consciousness continues in an embodied state as 'postmortem embodied experiences ' ; ( ii ) may not realize for a considerable time that he/she is already dead since consciousness continues to be embodied after death ( i.e. , 'postmortem perturbation ' - the duration of this perturbation can vary from person to person , in principle according to the type of death , and the level of conformation ) , and ( iii ) does not like to talk , remember , and/or explain things related to his/her own death because there is evidence that many events related to death are repressed in his/her unconscious ( 'postmortem cognitive repression ' ) . In addition , there is evidence that dying can be very traumatic to consciousness , especially to the murdered , and PTSD may even develop .

When a high-profile politician resigns , other elected officials usually release a carefully crafted statement marking their public service . Sometimes , for good measure , they 'll even include a summary of the retiring politician 's biggest accomplishments .
Then there 's Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi .
Talking to reporters about the resignation of Alberta Premier Alison Redford Wednesday , Nenshi was true to their reputation of going against the grain .
Instead of reiterating platitudes , Nenshi offered a lengthy indictment of the current political system -- one that they say allows for someone like Redford , `` a good person who has tried to do great things for this province , ” to be pushed out because of party politics .
Redford had been courting controversy for months , ever since it was revealed that they expensed approximately $ 45,000 for their trip to Nelson Mandela 's funeral in South Africa .
Although Redford initially ignored calls to refund the money , they recently relented . Despite them repaying the funds , the long-brewing backlash had apparently grown too large to contain . `` Obviously what has happened tonight will be covered as a political story , and it is a political story . But I also want to remind everyone that this is also a human story , ” Nenshi said in front of Calgary City Hall . `` It 's about a real person , a good person , a person who loves this province and has worked and made incredible sacrifices for this place… And it 's the story of a system that takes someone like that and chews them up and spits them out . ”
Nenshi then took aim at the party system , specifically members of Redford 's own Progressive Conservative party .
`` Why is it that we live in a province where we talk about ‘ the party ' as though there were only one party ? Why is it that decisions are made behind closed doors in caucus , or that unelected directors of a party -- unelected by the people -- make decisions on who gets to be our leader , ” they said . `` Some of this is longstanding practice , but some of this is just habit . And how do we break out of that habit ? ”
Nenshi said that every politician in the province needs to think about how the system currently operates , and they should look to municipal governments -- free of the party system -- as a good example of how it can be done right .
`` Take a lesson from municipal government . We have people sitting around our city council table of every possible political strip , ” they said . `` But we 've got to sit together , the 15 of us… The good ideas can come from either end of the spectrum . Sometimes people are so off the spectrum they meet at the other side . But we still got to sit together and come up with the right thing to do for the majority of Calgarians . ”
Nenshi did n't absolve Redford , saying `` there were a lot of errors of judgment , there were a lot of things I would n't have done had I been in that role .
`` But at the same time , today is a good day for us to take a step back and actually look at why we do this work and look at how we as citizens support people in doing this kind of work , ” they added .
When asked about their own political future -- specifically whether they would be running for the leadership of the Alberta PC Party -- Nenshi did n't say they were going to . But they did n't say they are n't going to either .
`` There will be lots and lots and lots of opportunities to talk about lots and lots and lots of different people , '' they said . `` I can tell you , regardless of whatever role I 'm in personally , I will take a very serious part in this next election , always fighting for the interests of Calgarians and Albertans . ”
This month , an Oregon pastor went on trial to face charges that he , like Kent Hovind before him , had n't paid income taxes since 1994 . On the stand , they offered a peculiar defense :
Attorney Mark Weintraub argued that Ronald Joling has a deeply held belief that they are not required to pay federal taxes , which they claims was influenced by their conservative Christian views and teachings he 's picked up from the sovereign citizen movement .
The local newspaper The Register-Guard reported on Joling 's testimony in more detail :
[ Joling ] said that their Bible-based , conservative Christian background provides a foundation for the conclusions they formed after reading the U.S. Constitution , the federal tax code and dozens of books penned by authors whose views on taxes and government made sense to him . “ It confirmed to me that I am not one that is made liable in that ( tax ) code , ” Joling testified . They added that their decision to stop paying taxes more than 20 years ago “ was the right and proper thing to do ” and that he 's sure their actions have put them on “ biblical safe ground . ”
Joling 's testimony shows that they belong to the “ sovereign citizen ” movement ( also known as freemen-on-the-land or OPCA litigants , for “ organized pseudolegal commercial argument ” ) , a loosely organized anti-government ideology whose members declare that they 're “ sovereign ” in themselves and , hence , not subject to any federal , state or local laws . Would-be sovereign citizens are usually tax resisters , as in Joling 's case , but they often seek to opt out of many other laws and regulations as well .
To back this up , sovereign citizens propose a wide variety of bizarre and fanciful legal theories . One of the most common is that the original , legitimate U.S. government ceased to exist at some point – the revocation of the gold standard is a popular choice – and was secretly replaced by a usurper government based on a completely different set of laws , which people have been tricked into accepting by devious propaganda . Another common belief is that , at everyone 's birth , the government creates a “ straw person ” – an artificial legal entity , typically with the same name as the real person , except in ALL CAPS – and that it 's the straw person , not the flesh-and-blood human being , who 's liable for fees , taxes and all the rest .
Religious themes often feature prominently , with sovereign citizens asserting that human beings owe allegiance only to God or some such . The best-known example is an Oregon sect calling itself the “ Embassy of Heaven ” which melds sovereign-citizen ideology with Christian fundamentalism , claiming to be God 's true and legitimate government on Earth . Its members frequently run afoul of the law for doing things like driving in cars with Embassy of Heaven-issued license plates . ( They have their own website , if you want some entertainment . )
Sovereign citizens treat the court system like a wizard incanting a magic spell . They 're convinced that if they utter the right code words , they 'll be immune from prosecution or lawsuits , or that they can claim a share of the vast hoard of cash they 're sure the government is illegally withholding ( Ronald Joling , the Oregon pastor , has sued county officials to demand “ 27,000 ounces of pure silver ” ) . Frequently , this extends down to filing pleadings with extremely specific fonts , colors and punctuation usage . Sometimes it 's even more specific than that , as in this Time Cube-esque example containing dozens of paragraphs of gibberish :
For the establishment of the Truth with the noun-subject-matter-language with this Counter-claim in the now-tense is with the now-tense-seizure/salvage of the fiction-jurisdiction , in the use by the PLAINTIFF and DEFENDANT by the COUNTER-CLAIM , by the [ DE ] FENDANT . fictitious-language/scribble/scribble-procedures of the English-language by the PLAINTIFF and DEFENDANT by the COUNTER-CLAIM is with the creation of the fictitious-language/scribble by the
PLAINTIFF and DEFENDANT by the COUNTER-CLAIM . …For the use of the pre-fix : De , with the word : De-fendant , is with the use of the pre-fix for the negation of the root-word , fendant , by the attachment and modification of the pre-fix of the negation : De , by a procedure of the English-language .
Another example by the same fellow :
For this federal-judge : David-Wynn : Miller's-correction of the vassalees-fiction-syntax-grammar-pleadings is with the correction-participation-claim of this babble-indictment-evidence and : bad-probation-syntax=grammar-evidence . ( Why did the vassalees do this case with a void-communications ? ) For the void-drogue-law , void-oath of an office , void-judge's-oath , void-docking-court-house-vessel in the Washington-state-dry-dock and : void-original-lodial-land-title .
The only thing all these schemes have in common is that they do n't work . The legal incantations invariably fail to have the desired effect ; sovereign citizens facing criminal charges do n't magically get set free , much less handed a pile of gold for their trouble . The most famous case was the actor Wesley Snipes , who spent three years in prison after refusing to pay taxes , citing sovereign-citizen arguments and claiming to be a “ nonresident alien ” . ( My personal favorite is the judge who told one of them : “ The Court therefore feels some measure of responsibility to inform Defendant that all the fancy legal-sounding things they have read on the internet are make-believe . ” )
But since sovereign citizen ideology ca n't hold out for vindication in the afterlife , what I wonder is how the movement persists and propagates itself . Some of them – the “ gurus ” who travel the country giving lectures and selling books and advice on how to opt out of the law – are obviously just con artists , cynically exploiting the gullible to enrich themselves . But many of them are sincere . They recite their incomprehensible legalese in the apparent belief that this will really work . How do they deal with the cognitive dissonance of seeing their fellow travelers convicted , or being convicted themselves ? How do they explain the failure of their pseudolegal jargon to have the claimed effect ?
Unfortunately , at least part of the answer seems to be that when their tactics fail , their frustration curdles into anger and worse . Sovereign citizens are notorious sources of so-called “ paper terrorism “ , filing malicious liens and other documents whose purpose is to clog the court system and harass their enemies . A few of them turn to actual terrorism : earlier this year , a sovereign citizen named Dennis Marx attacked a courthouse in Georgia , apparently planning to storm the building and take hostages , but was shot and killed by police before they made it inside . There was also a father-and-son pair , Joseph and Jerry Kane , who murdered two Arkansas police officers during a traffic stop and were later killed in a shootout . As their kooky claims run aground on the shoals of reality , it 's unfortunately likely we can expect more sovereign citizens to turn to violence .

Are you eagerly waiting for This Is Us to return at the beginning of the new year ?
Sorry , you 're going to have to wait a little longer . The midseason premiere date for the family drama — which has eight episodes left in season 2 — will shift one week later , from Jan. 2 to Jan. 9 , it was announced on Tuesday . No reason was given for the move , but look at it this way : Now you have an extra week to recover from your New Year 's Day festivities . [ UPDATE : According to a network insider , the shift allows the show to run more episodes consecutively leading up to the Olympics . ]
This Is Us concluded the first half of season 2 on Nov. 28 , as Kevin ( Justin Hartley ) was arrested for DUI with niece Tess ( Eris Baker ) stowing away in their backseat . This news was not well-received , of course , by their parents , Randall ( Sterling K. Brown ) and Beth ( Susan Kelechi Watson ) .

We are n't living in a healthy democracy . ( Michael Conroy/AP Photo )
In a healthy democracy , there would be nothing necessarily wrong with a major party fully embracing demagoguery as its modus operandi . As long as a republic 's other franchisees meet the demagogues on the field of political battle , according to fair and prearranged rules of engagement , we can be confident democratic partisans would win the day .
But we do n't live in healthy democracy , because one of our major parties , in addition to embracing demagoguery as its modus operandi , has declared war on public debate . Instead of engaging in politics , in which winners emerge from the partisan clash of ideas , Republicans have for decades told party members that policies do n't matter and that issues do n't matter – all that matters are matters of identity .
`` Identity politics '' is a phrase usually reserved for liberal Democrats said to have lost touch with the white working-class or activist movements like Black Lives Matter . But these factions do not place identity at the center of their politics , because they must by necessity build broad and diverse coalitions to achieve their goals . Values , like political equality , are central , not group identity .
The opposite is true of today 's Republican Party . It can win – and did win in 2016 – by dividing the electorate between `` us '' and `` them , '' and bypassing serious debate over policies and principles . Identity , specifically white group identity , is central to not only how it operates but to its being . Indeed , it 's not possible to imagine today 's GOP without white group identity . And because identity is so central , it has evolved into a party of demagogues .
Patricia Roberts-Miller , a rhetoric professor at the University of Texas at Austin , put it this way in their slim new volume titled `` Demagoguery and Democracy '' : `` Demagoguery depoliticizes politics , '' they said , `` in that it says we do n't have to argue policies , and can just rouse ourselves to new levels of commitment to * us * and purify our community or nation of * them * . It says that we are in such a desperate situation that we can no longer afford * them * the same treatment we want for * us * . ''
Identity , of course , is probably hard-wired . It seems reasonable that our ancestors evolved with a sense that in-group members were safe while out-group members were dangerous . Even `` The Federalist Papers , '' Roberts-Miller told me during a short conversation over the phone , were preoccupied by identity . `` It was central the American conception of democracy , '' they said . `` Identity politics '' was not called that until the last century when partisans fought to enfranchise Americans of `` marked identity '' – that is , anyone who was not a straight , male and white .
Roberts-Miller has been studying demagoguery for years . They first noticed the trend begin to surge in the run up to the 2003 Iraq invasion . Public debate from conservative quarters was not about the pros and cons of invasion but `` demonizing deliberation '' itself , they said . `` People were listening to pundits say they should n't listen to politics . '' All they had to do was trust President George W. Bush .
`` Demonizing deliberation '' is n't the only cause of our democracy 's illness . So is Russia 's assault on American public opinion . During the summer of 2016 , Roberts-Miller saw supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders retelling stories about Hillary Clinton that `` were very clearly Russian in origin . '' This is more terrifying than most realize , because Russia 's success in bending public opinion in favor of a candidate who favors Russia is not supposed to happen . What 's supposed to happen , according to Aristotle , is truth prevailing over falsehood .
But it did n't .
The key here is `` all things being equal . '' All things being equal , the ancient Greek philosopher wrote in `` Rhetoric , '' truth will defeat falsehood in a open contest of ideas . But when 10 million people see Facebook ads purchased for $ 100,000 that spread with laser-precision anti-black , anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant propaganda , when thousands of Twitter bots savage Donald Trump 's primary rivals before their campaigns have even begun , when Russian `` active measures '' are discovered on Google , the world 's largest ad platform , all things are very not equal . Given most do not even know they are spreading falsehoods at the time they are spreading them , Aristotle 's solution in the event of truth 's failure – to blame the audience and the culture they inhabit – seems maddeningly inadequate .
Demagoguery , thank god , does n't work on small-r republicans who believe in democracy , because democracy runs against the grain of in-group and out-group thinking . Justice , for instance , is n't only for those who deserve it—meaning the in-group . Instead , justice is a product of due process , equal treatment and impartial adjudication . In other words , justice is about liberal democratic values .
Indeed , those who believe democracy is the best form of government because it 's the least bad form of government know demagoguery just sounds too simple , and so it has a limited hold on their thinking . As Roberts-Miller wrote in their new book : `` Democracy is about having to listen , and compromise , and it 's about being wrong ( and admitting it ) . It 's about guessing – because the world is complicated – the best course of action , and trying to look at things from various perspectives , and letting people with those various perspectives participate in the conversation .
`` Democracy is hard ; demagoguery is easy . ''

My chopper manifesto
President Trump vouched for their own character Wednesday by citing their diploma from the University of Pennsylvania , claiming it proves they are not as bawdy as the media portrays him .
“ I think the press makes me more uncivil than I am , ” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One for a trip to Texas . “ You know , people do n't understand . I went to an Ivy League college . I was a nice student . I did very well . I 'm a very intelligent person . You know , the fact is I think — I really believe — I think the press creates a different image of Donald Trump than the real person . ”
Note that Trump did not say they are civil ; they said the media depicts them as more uncivil than they actually are . They did not describe themselves as a kind person or a polite person ; they described themselves as an intelligent person .
[ The Daily 202 : Flake and Corker feel liberated to speak their minds . That should terrify Trump . ]
Trump is certainly smart enough to know what they were doing — deflecting a question about one personality trait by addressing another .

What 's striking about the president 's claim that “ the press creates a different image of Donald Trump than the real person ” is that Trump prides themselves on shaping their own image through social media . And it is on Twitter — where there is no media filter — that Trump often appears to be at their most uncivil .
Trump 's remarks assume that more-educated people are also gracious people , which is , of course , not always the case . Trump voters — 69 percent of whom do not have degrees from any colleges , never mind Ivy League institutions , according to the American National Election Study — surely would disagree with the president 's logic .
[ Gold Star widow Myeshia Johnson said Trump stumbled recalling their husband 's name ]
The surprising thing about Trump 's comments is not that they cast blame on the media or employed a straw-man argument but that they betrayed a mind-set that is anathema to so many of their supporters . If , as Trump said , “ people do n't understand ” that they graduated from Penn , it is because as a politician they have worked hard to cast themselves not as an elitist but as an everyman . The president praises themselves regularly but seldom talks about their educational background .
Regaling voters with the story of how he , a millionaire 's son , arrived on Penn 's stately campus in a flashy convertible in 1966 somehow never made it into Trump 's stump speech .
Put on the spot Wednesday , however , Trump reached for a credential that they consider impressive . And it had little to do with civility .
A Winter Haven woman is facing aggravated manslaughter charges after two of their newborns died from apparent co-sleeping despite numerous warnings , deputies say .
Erin Piche-Pitts , 25 , had their first child in November 2009 and was counseled before giving birth on the dangers of sleeping in the same bed as the baby , according to the Polk County Sheriff 's Office .
Thirteen days later , Piche-Pitts fell asleep while breastfeeding the newborn , deputies said . They woke up sometime later to find the baby girl unresponsive .
Medical crews pronounced them dead at a hospital and Sheriff 's officials said the girl died from asphyxia `` due to probable overlay and co-sleeping . '' Them death was ruled an accident .
Piche-Pitts got pregnant again this year , and in March attended a training on the dangers of co-sleeping and how to safely put a baby to bed , the Sheriff 's Office said . Family members also talked with them about being more careful because of the first child 's death and Piche-Pitts went to additional counseling about safe sleeping .

Deputies said Piche-Pitts gave birth to a boy Sept. 18 and hospital staff talked with them again about safety . Eighteen days later , on Oct. 6 , the baby woke up crying , so Piche-Pitts prepared a bottle and propped them up in their arms in bed , according to the Sheriff 's Office .
Piche-Pitts then fell asleep for more than two hours and woke up to find the boy unresponsive , deputies said . They died at Winter Haven Hospital .
Deputies said Piche-Pitts had `` repeated warnings '' about co-sleeping and determined the baby 's death was `` through their own culpable negligence . ''
They were arrested Tuesday on a charge of aggravated manslaughter of a child , a first-degree felony .
In July , while pregnant with the boy , deputies arrested Piche-Pitts on a possession of methamphetamine charge after they said they found paraphernalia with drug residue on it in a vehicle they were sitting in . They told a deputy after their arrest that they have n't used meth in more than two years , a report shows .
Prosecutors later declined to formally charge her , records show , and the case was dropped .

In work that heralds a new , more potent form of targeted therapy for cancer , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute scientists have devised a chemical technology that does n't just disable malevolent proteins in tumor cells , as current agents do , but destroys them .
As described in a study posted online May 21 by Science magazine , the strategy uses tumor cells ' own protein-chopping machinery to break down and dispose of proteins that drive cancer growth . When tested in laboratory samples of leukemia cells and in animals with human-like leukemia , the approach caused cancer cells to die much more quickly than with conventional targeted therapies .
Researchers developed the strategy as a way to develop inhibitors of `` undruggable '' proteins and overcome drug resistance , a common shortcoming of targeted therapies . Resistance arises when tumors that originally responded to a particular therapy manage to circumvent the drug 's effects and resume their growth .
`` One of the reasons resistance occurs is that cancer-related proteins often have multiple functions within the cell , and conventional targeted therapies inhibit just one or a few of those functions , '' said the paper 's senior author , James Bradner , MD , an oncologist and chemist at Dana-Farber . `` Conventional drugs allow the targeted protein to adapt to the drug , and the cell finds alternate routes for its growth signals .
`` We began designing approaches that cause the target protein to disintegrate , rather than merely be inhibited , '' they continued . `` It would be very powerful if we could chemically convert an inhibitor drug into a degrader drug . ''
Doing so would involve manipulating the cell 's natural protein-elimination system . Used-up or unneeded proteins are tagged for disposal by enzymes that attach a protein called ubiquitin to them . The marked proteins are then brought to a structure called the proteasome , where they 're ground up and recycled . Three enzymes -- dubbed E1 , E2 , and E3 -- collaborate to affix the tags .
To harness this system for the destruction of cancer proteins , Bradner 's team designed a chemical adapter that attaches to a targeted drug molecule . The adapter works like a tiny trailer hitch , enabling the drug to tow the cell 's protein-degradation machinery directly to the protein of interest . Once bound to that protein , the combination drug-and-protein-degrader essentially demolish it .
The team tested the technology -- which they dubbed `` degronimids '' -- in laboratory samples of leukemia cells . They began with the drug JQ1 , which inhibits BRD4 , a protein that orchestrates the expression of cancer growth genes . They built an adapter out of phthalimide -- a chemical derivative of the drug thalidomide -- and attached it to JQ1 . The phthalimide was designed to bind snugly to a protein-degrading enzyme E3 ( called Cereblon ) , making it ideal as a trailer hitch .
When investigators treated the leukemia cells with a JQ1-and-phthalimide `` conjugate '' called dBET1 , the BRD4 protein within the cells was degraded in less than an hour . Such rapid and extensive degradation suggests that conjugates may be able to prevent or hinder cancer cells from developing resistance to targeted therapies , the researchers state .
`` The potency , selectivity , and rapidity of this approach -- namely the ability to home in specifically on BRD4 -- are unprecedented in clinical approaches to protein degradation , '' Bradner said .
To determine how selective dBET1 actually is , the researchers measured the levels of all proteins in leukemia cells one and two hours after treatment . `` We were stunned to find that only three proteins of more than 7,000 in the entire cell were degraded : BRD2 , 3 , and 4 , -- an exceptional degree of selectivity guided by the intended targets of JQ1 , '' Bradner said . `` It 's as though dBET1 is laser-guided to deliver protein-degrading machinery to targeted proteins . ''
The investigators then tested dBET1 in mice bearing a widespread and aggressive form of human leukemia . As in the laboratory cell samples , there was a rapid degradation of BRD4 in the tumor cells and a powerful anti-leukemia effect , with few noticeable side effects .
To see if compounds other than JQ1 can be used as a guidance system for a conjugate , the researchers created a set of molecules that lock the protein-degradation machinery onto a compound called SLF , which targets a protein called FKBP12 . When they treated cancer cells with SLF , they found it degraded the vast majority of FKBP12 in the cells within a few hours .
Buoyed by these results , Dana-Farber researchers are working to create a derivative of dBET1 that can be used as a drug in human patients -- and to extend the conjugate strategy for the treatment of other cancers and other genetically-caused diseases .
`` We 're very excited that this chemical technology may offer a way to improve much cancer drug molecules , and of course this strategy has implications beyond cancer for the treatment of other life-threatening diseases , '' Bradner said .
`` The dBET1 and the dFKBP12 compounds are presently in a late stage of lead optimization for therapeutic development in both cancer and non-malignant diseases , '' says Prem Das , PhD , chief research business development officer at Dana-Farber . `` Composition-of-matter and method-of-use patent applications have been filed on these and other additional targeted agents , as well as on the chemistry platform . They will be licensed for commercialization to an appropriate company according to standard Dana-Farber practice . '' Potential partners or investors can contact Das at the Belfer Office for Dana-Farber Innovations .
`` is a rule I use while I establish new habits .
Habits need consistency to build up . At the initial stage of forming habit , we usually do n't miss any days . But as time builds up , motivation fades away and we slowly start to move away from our habit building goal .
During this period , there 's high chance that we will miss our habit building streak some day . And most of us get discouraged and never go back into forming that habit again .
I think it 's the critical point where we all fall off our goal . Missing a day when we are on solid streak is very demotivating . We then abandon our habit building goal altogether . It 's mainly because we take `` I missed yesterday '' so seriously . The more you dwell into it , the more demotivated you get .
Instead of taking it so seriously , it 's better to forget that you missed a day , and then start again . Just keep going . It should n't matter at all .
The main goal is to establish a habit , not to have a solid streak . Of course , if you have a solid streak , you 'll have established a habit . But you should n't keep the fate of your new habit solely on building the streak . There should be no external factor effecting your habit building goal .
Focusing solely on building streak might effect your habit building goal . You can build habits even if you miss a day .
It 's like you refrained from eating junk foods for 3 weeks and you suddenly ate a small amount of junk food , and then you freak out that your 3 week streak came to an end and then leave the habit and start eating junk foods again .
That should n't happen . If you ate small amount of junk food , fine . Continue your habit building streak again . Just do n't abandon your habit building goal .
This happened to me today . I was on a solid streak of taking my personal video everyday this month , and by chance I missed yesterday . After that , I felt bad and demotivated .
How awesome and motivating would it be if I had n't missed any day this month ?
But that does n't matter . If I keep dwelling on perfection -- to not miss any day -- I 'll start thinking about starting this again another month and not missing any day . And then , I 'll leave my building habit for this month .
After that , I 'll actually never start again . The chances are pretty low because I 'm already demotivated .
It 's the point where you give up your habit building goal . Just do n't give up because you missed a single day .
Instead of feeling bad about missing a day , continue taking videos without stressing much on the fact that you missed a day . Your main goal should be to establish habit , not freak out after you miss a day .
This happens while you try establishing any habit . Be it , writing , reading , eating healthy , quitting drugs , meditating , speaking , staying fit , running , etc .
Everyone forgets , so do n't make it a big deal . Only people who do n't stress over the fact that they forgot a day will move forward with their habit building goal .
Some part of me opposes against using habit building apps because it 's mainly focused on habit building chain . If you miss a day , all your progress will fall down . You 'll see it . And then you feel extremely demotivated because you have to start from zero .
Tracking habits is fine , but taking streak too seriously might not help you in the long run if you feel demotivated every time you miss a day .
Missing a day while building new habits is okay . Do n't take it too seriously , do n't get demotivated , just keep going !

Hezbollah is like a red bull to the Israelis , and now Israel hopes to annihilate it by completely weakening Syrian regime , Middle East expert and historian Tariq Ali told RT .
RT : Foreign media reported over the weekend that Israel was behind the attack on Russian missiles in Latakia , what motivation do you think could be for Israel in it ?
Tariq Ali : Its motivation , as always , is to show the Arabs , both inside Israel and outside , look this is how tough we are , we can hit any target in the Middle East that we want and no one can do anything about it . That was the aim . The attack on Latakia by the Israelis , if it was them , and the American sources are saying it was , and Israel has n't denied it . They have n't confirmed it but they have n't denied it . Informal sources in the Israeli press are saying that it was an attack designed to immobilize Russian anti-ship missiles that have been given to Syria . Well , that is an open breach of a country 's sovereignty which the Israelis have done in the past and which they carry on doing . This is a country which is above the law , or considers itself above the law , and it 's United States ' master and European friends will do nothing to stop it .
RT : But it 's obvious that Israel has no right to breach any country 's sovereignty .
TA : Of course , they have no right but they 've occupied sovereign states , they 've taken chances on their territory in the case of Lebanon for many years . Hezbollah is like a red bull to the Israelis . It attacks , and the Israelis have n't been able to wipe it out though they 've tried . They are now hoping to do it by completely weakening or destroying the Syrian regime . It 's Hezbollah which is at the center of Israeli interest . It is the only group in the Arab world for a very long time which has actually inflicted some blows on Israel , first forcing them to withdraw from Lebanon , and then resisting one of their big attacks and invasions of the same country . So that is what they would like to do , but I think Hezbollah is probably the best armed and the best led liberation movement in the region . So it 's not going to be as easy as their match .
RT : Do you think the US knew beforehand about the Latakia attack ?
TA : Virtually everything Israel does is coordinated with the US . You have very close links between the IDF and the Pentagon , this is hardly a secret ; their intelligence services collaborate and help each other . So I have very little doubt the Israelis inform the US that they were going to attack Latakia , and the US registered it . Whether they said go ahead and do it formally , I do n't know , most probably they did . This is how Israel functions and the Americans never yet attempted to stop it .
RT : Do you think Israel could go as far as to provide actual help to Syrian rebels ?
TA : The Israelis are pursuing their own agenda , they always do . However , they are not dumb , the people in Jerusalem . They know that by doing this and further weakening the regime the Syrian state could break up or be completely destroyed . So they are not unaware of what is happening in that country and indirectly I 'd say yes , they are providing help to the rebels .
RT : Are you surprised to learn that Syrian troops allegedly seized chemical weapons belonging to rebels ?
TA : No , if it turns out to be true , and I do n't know whether it is or not , it would n't surprise me at all . It 's very clear that the sections of the rebel leadership have been desperate for western military intervention and prepared to go a long way to achieve it . I remember before or just after this sarin gas attack , media emblazoned it across their front pages in some European countries to put pressure on Washington . The fact that Washington then pulled back from going beyond what they 're already doing indicates that they were not convinced . I think the Russian UN ambassador was absolutely right : the West has no proof that sarin gas was being used by the Syrian state . So if the latest claim from the Syrians is true , it 's very serious indeed .
RT : Then the US has to react to that .
TA : No , Washington does n't need to react at all . Double standards prevail in international diplomacy , there are very few norms . If it 's not in the interest of the US and its European Union allies to react they wo n't react at all . They will not treat the rebels in the same way as they are treating the Syrian state .
RT : A FSA commander has recently been killed by radicals on their own side , now we 're hearing allegations that the rebels are using chemical weapons , surely this has got to change the stance of the West and the US towards supporting the rebels now , has n't it ?
TA : I should hope so . Certainly , public opinion in the US and in Britain is opposed by a fairly convincing majority to any western intervention in Syria . In senior politicians , including conservative politicians in Britain , have said very clearly that they are not going to support any such venture . Whether President Obama will decide now – he 's been very hesitant till now to go for this – remains to be seen . I 'd have thought that the chances for the western military intervention on the Libyan model are becoming more and more remote but I can be wrong .
RT : Let 's just put western interest aside . What about the friend of Syria saying that Lebanon and Iran should not be involved and yet the Gulf Arab states are clearly involved in this .
TA : Well , it 's absolutely true what you say . Both the Saudis and the Qataris have been involved . Both in Egypt by way of backing their favorite horses in that particular race , and in Syria very openly by arming the Salafi groups and the more moderate Jihadi groups . So there 's no doubt that this is indirect military intervention , clearly green-lighted by the US because without their approval it 's very unlikely that these things would be happening . I think that the Gulf States have got American approval to help . Whether they will continue to get this approval remains to be seen .
Not to be confused with Jules Verne Award
The Trophy , displayed at the National Maritime Museum , Paris .
The Jules Verne Trophy is a prize for the fastest circumnavigation of the world by any type of yacht with no restrictions on the size of the crew provided the vessel has registered with the organization and paid an entry fee . [ 1 ] A vessel holding the Jules Verne trophy will not necessarily hold the absolute round the world record . The trophy was first awarded to the first yacht which sailed around the world in less than 80 days . The name of the award is a reference to the Jules Verne novel Around the World in Eighty Days in which Phileas Fogg traverses the planet ( albeit by railroad and steamboat ) in 80 days . The current holder is IDEC Sport skippered by Francis Joyon in 40 days 23 hours 30 minutes 30 seconds . [ 2 ]

The trophy is open to any type of boat with no restrictions .
Crew size is not restricted .
The circumnavigation must be completed non-stop and with no physical outside assistance . On-shore weather routing is allowed .
Challengers must respect safety rules .
History [ edit ]
The original idea for this competition has been attributed to Yves Le Cornec in 1985 . The rules were defined in 1990 . A committee was put in place to guarantee respect of the rules and fairplay . This committee included Peter Blake , Florence Arthaud , Jean François Coste , Yvon Fauconnier , Gabrie Guilly , Robin Knox-Johnston , Titouan Lamazou , Yves Le Cornec , Bruno Peyron , Olivier de Kersauson , and Didier Ragot .
While the current holder of the trophy , Francis Joyon , also holds the around the world sailing record , this has not always been the case . In 2004 Steve Fossett broke the world record with the catamaran Cheyenne but was not awarded the trophy . According to reports , the trophy organizers requested a higher entrance fee from Fossett than from the other competitors , the difference which they refused to pay . The winner of the trophy that year was Olivier de Kersauson on Geronimo , with a time which was five days slower than Fossett 's world record . [ 1 ]

Failed record attempts [ edit ]
The Trophy [ edit ]
The `` Trophy Jules Verne '' was the subject of a public order of the visual arts delegation with the American artist Tom Shannon and is patroned by the French Ministry of Culture .
The work is a floating hull on a magnetic field , much as an anchorage for a ship . All dimensions have rigorous symbolic meaning . The midship beam of the hull corresponds to the diameter of the Earth , the ray of each end is proportional to that of the moon and the radius of the curvature of the frames is that of the sun . The competitors of the Trophy Jules Verne race around the Earth against time , with only the sun and the moon as companions and timekeepers .
The sculpture is placed on a cast aluminium base , on which the names of the sailors having won the Trophy are engraved . The Musée national de la Marine in Paris hosts and maintains the Trophy . Each winner receives a miniature of the Trophy , magnetized like the original one .
When a record is broken , an official ceremony is held for the previous record holders to hand over the trophy to the new record holders , who are given the hull and must place it in its magnetic field mooring .

DAVIS , Calif. , Oct. 5 , 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- While a punishing drought lingers , an unpredictable El Nino threatens , and California recovers from recurring wildfires , strategies are in demand to protect the State 's natural resources and its famed agricultural productivity from fickle climatic conditions . USDA 's Natural Resources Conservation Service ( NRCS ) in California and partners believe at least part of the answer lies just underfoot .
This week the agency is highlighting five farmers who have successfully and profitably increased the health of the soil on their farms resulting in improved system resiliency .
The five farmers are Scott Park , Meridian ; Fritz Durst , Esparto ; Jesse Sanchez , Firebaugh ; Michael Crowell , Turlock , and Russ Lester , Winters . The story of how each discovered and implemented soil health-improving systems on their farm will be featured on successive days in video and print at www.ca.nrcs.usda.gov .
NRCS is also collaborating with Resource Conservation Districts and UC Cooperative Extension to develop regional hubs of soil health innovation in the state . `` While NRCS offers technical and financial assistance to those pursuing healthy soil on their farms , we know that sometimes the best way to learn is from others working towards the same goals and encountering the same problems , '' says NRCS State Conservationist Carlos Suarez .
`` Healthy soil is critical for increasing the resiliency of California agriculture , '' says Suarez . `` Healthy soil can absorb water during wet times , and make it available during dry times , '' they said , noting that a one percent boost in organic matter can result in the top foot of soil holding an extra 25,000 gallons of water .
Furthermore , increasing soil organic matter means less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and more carbon providing energy to support a complex soil food web with all its benefits . `` Carbon is a building block of life—putting it back in the soil contributes to ecological balance and greater resiliency for the farmer , '' says Suarez .
Three years ago NRCS launched a national soil health initiative on Dave Brandt 's Ohio farm . Farmers across the Nation are adopting healthy soil systems—reducing or eliminating tillage , managing residue , planting cover crops , and increasing diversity . The cropping systems and climate of California present some unique challenges for agriculture in the state , says Suarez .
California has over 300 agricultural commodities , over 2500 soil types , diverse climatic conditions , complete dependence on irrigation during the summer , and high-value farms with complex management systems . This may limit farmers ' willingness to try seemingly untested methods , says Suarez . Crops that need irrigation and/or pollination—the bulk of California 's output— increase this complexity still further . Almonds , for example , need a cover crop that blooms when pollinators arrive on the farm , but fades thereafter so as not to compete for the insects ' attention .
There are challenges , but the five farmers highlighted this week prove that the health of California soils can be improved through management that focuses on the soil as a living ecosystem , says Suarez .

In which I argue you should n't be afraid of returning even large objects by value .
If you have somewhat large collections of somewhat large objects in a performance-critical application , which of the following functions would you prefer ?
void getObjects ( vector < C > & objs ) ; vector < C > getObjects ( ) ;
The first version looks faster , right ? After all , the second one returns a copy of the vector , and to do that , all the elements have to be copied . Sounds expensive ! Better then , to pass inn a reference to a vector that is filled , and avoid the expensive return .
The second version is however easier to use , since it communicates more clearly what it does , and does not require the caller to define the vector to be filled . Compare
doSomethingWith ( getObjects ( ) ) ;
against the more cubmersome
vector < C > temp ; getObjects ( temp ) ; doSomethingWith ( temp ) ;
Sounds like a classic tradeoff between speed and clarity then . Except it is n't ! Both functions incur the exact same number of copies , even on the lowest optimization levels , and without inlining anything . How is that possible ? The answer is the Return Value Optimization ( RVO ) , which allows the compiler to optimize away the copy by having the caller and the callee use the same chunk of memory for both “ copies ” .
If you got the point , and take my word for it , you can stop reading now . What follows is a somewhat lengthy example demonstrating the RVO being used in several typical situations .
Example
Basically , I have a class C , which counts the times it is constructed or copy constructed , and a library of functions that demonstrate slightly different ways of returning instances of C .
Here are the getter functions :
C getTemporaryC ( ) { return C ( ) ; } C getLocalC ( ) { C c ; return c ; } C getDelegatedC ( ) { return getLocalC ( ) ; } vector < C > getVectorOfC ( ) { vector < C > v ; v.push_back ( C ( ) ) ; return v ; }
I then call each of these functions , measuring the number of constructors and copy constructors called :
int main ( ) { C c1 ; print_copies ( `` 1 : Constructing '' ) ; C c2 ( c1 ) ; print_copies ( `` 2 : Copy constructing '' ) ; C c3 = getTemporaryC ( ) ; print_copies ( `` 3 : Returning a temporary '' ) ; C c4 = getLocalC ( ) ; print_copies ( `` 4 : Returning a local '' ) ; C c5 = getDelegatedC ( ) ; print_copies ( `` 5 : Returning through a delegate '' ) ; vector < C > v = getVectorOfC ( ) ; print_copies ( `` 6 : Returning a local vector '' ) ; }
Update : I used gcc 4.5.2 to test this . Since then , people have tested using other compilers , getting less encouraging results . Please see the comments , and the summary table near the end .
This is the result :
1 : Constructing used 0 copies , 1 ctors .
2 : Copy constructing used 1 copies , 0 ctors .
3 : Returning a temporary used 0 copies , 1 ctors .
4 : Returning a local used 0 copies , 1 ctors .
5 : Returning through a delegate used 0 copies , 1 ctors .
6 : Returning a local vector used 1 copies , 1 ctors .
Discussion
1 and 2 are just there to demonstrate that the counting works . In 1 , the constructor is called once , and in 2 the copy constructor is called once .
Then we get to the interesting part ; In 3 and 4 , we see that returning a copy does not invoke the copy constructor , even when the initial C is allocated on the stack in a local variable .
Then we get to 5 , which also returns by value , but where the initial object is not allocated by the function itself . Rather , it gets its object from calling yet antother function . Even this chaining of methods does n't defeat the RVO , there is still not a single copy being made .
Finally , in 6 , we try returing a container , a vector . Aha ! A copy was made ! But the copy that gets counted is made by vector : :push_back ( ) , not by returning the vector . So we see that the RVO also works when returning containers .
A curious detail
The normal rule for optimization used by the C++ standard is that the compiler is free to use whatever crazy cheating tricks it can come up with , as long as the result is no different from the non-optimized code . Can you spot where this rule is broken ? In my example , the copy constructor has a side effect , incrementing the counter of copies made . That means that if the copy is optimized away , the result of the program is now different with and without RVO ! This it what makes the RVO different from other optimizations , in that the compiler is actually allowed to optimize away the copy constructor even if it has side effects .
Conclusion
This has been my longest post so far , but the conclusion is simple : Do n't be afraid of returning large objects by value ! Your code will be simpler , and just as fast .

Mohammed Ghannouchi , who was the prime minister , took over as president of Tunisia on Friday [ REUTERS ]
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , Tunisia 's president , fled the country on Friday amid a wave of deadly social protests in a dramatic end to their 23 years in power .
In an address on state television Mohammed Ghannouchi , the country 's prime minister , announced that they had taken over as interim president .
They invoked Article 56 of the constitution saying it allowed them to take over temporarily if the president was not able to carry out their duties .
However , legal circles in Tunisia fear that Ghannouchi 's statement was an act of evasion of the constitution , merely to serve Ben Ali 's interests .
Article 56 , on which Ghannouchi 's statement was made , states that in the event the president of the republic is incapable of discharging their duties temporarily , they may order for their powers and authorities be delegated to the first minister , save the right of dissolving the parliament .
During this period of temporary incapacity , the government shall remain standing until such state of incapacity is eliminated , even if the government is chastised ( impeached ) .
The president shall inform the speaker of the parliament and the chairperson of the advisers board of the temporary delegation of their powers .
Legal experts , however , argue that in the current situation , the head of parliament is the only legitimate person granted the right , as stipulated in article 57 of the Tunisian Constitution , to form a legitimate [ caretaker ] government , for about 45 days to be followed by presidential election .
In an interview with Al Jazeera , Ghannouchi said it was not the right time to argue `` law or constitution '' .
`` Adoption of Article 57 is a very likely scenario , yet I took over as Acting President based on Article 56 .
`` Parliamentary elections will be held , meetings with all political and social powers will be convened . Tomorrow after consultation with parties , further details will be announced . Other measures will be adopted if it is ascertained that Ben Ali 's departure is final . '' Ghannouchi said .
Article 57
Article 57 states that when the post of the president of the republic falls vacant due to their demise , resignation or total incapacitation , the constitutional council shall forthwith convene and declare the definitive vacancy under the absolute majority of its members , which matter shall be expressly made known to the chairperson of advisers council and speaker of the parliament , where the latter ( speaker ) shall immediately undertake the presidential duties on temporary basis for not less than 45 days ; and not more than 60 days .
In case the said definite vacancy coincides with the dissolution of the parliament , the chairperson of advisers council shall undertake the presidential duties on a temporary basis for the same period .
The officer undertaking the duties of the president on temporary basis shall take the constitutional oath before the parliament and the advisers council jointly convening , and if required , before the bureaus of the two houses . In case the said definitive vacancy coincides with the dissolution of the parliament , the constitutional oath may be taken before the advisers council , and if required before its bureau .
The officer undertaking the duties of the president on temporary basis shall not be permitted to be nominated for the presidency , even if they render their resignation .
The officer undertaking the duties of the president on temporary basis shall discharge the presidential duties ; provided that they shall not be entitled to resort to referendum , dissolve the government , dissolve the parliament , or take any of the exceptional measures set out in Chapter 46 .
It shall not be permissible during the transitional presidential period to amend the constitution or chastise ( impeach ) the government .
And during the transitional presidential period , a new president shall be elected for the term of five years .
The newly elected president may dissolve the parliament , and call for premature parliamentary elections in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph Second of Chapter 63 .
( CNN ) Two sheriff 's deputies in Georgia have been placed on leave with pay for `` inappropriate actions '' in the case of a college student who died in the county jail , a Chatham County Sheriff 's Office spokesperson said .
Cpl . Maxine Evans and Cpl . Jason Kenny will remain on administrative leave until the conclusion of an investigation into the death of Matthew Ajibade , a 21-year-old student from Nigeria who died last week in an isolation cell of the Savannah jail , said Gena Bilbo , the sheriff 's spokesperson .
Authorities provided no further details into the deputies ' conduct .
The two deputies could n't be immediately reached for comment Thursday .
Ajibade , who had bipolar disorder , died in custody after they `` became combative during the booking process , '' the Sheriff 's Office alleged .
Their family is demanding to know why Ajibade died .
During the alleged jail altercation , three deputies were injured , including a female sergeant who suffered a concussion and broken nose , authorities said .
The two deputies now on leave were n't among the three injured , Bilbo said . The sergeant is on medical leave , but the other two injured deputies remain on duty , said Chief Deputy Roy Harris .
The alleged combativeness does n't square with family members ' description of the 21-year-old , whom they described as a much-loved `` geeky kid . ''
The Nigeria native was in Savannah studying computer science .
Ajibade 's family has hired Mark O'Mara , a CNN legal analyst who once represented George Zimmerman in the death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin .
O'Mara called the disciplinary action against the two deputies `` a good small step in holding people responsible for their actions . ''
Cpl . Jason Kenny
`` We still need questions answered how Matthew 's life was taken from him , '' O'Mara added .
The body was released to the family Thursday morning , O'Mara said .
The attorney hopes to see `` discourse of all available information as soon as possible , '' they said .
Ajibade was diagnosed with bipolar disorder three years ago and was having a medical emergency at the time of their arrest and confinement , O'Mara said .
Savannah police arrested Ajibade on January 1 after receiving a call about a domestic disturbance .
When police arrived , they witnessed Ajibade holding a woman under a blanket , according to an incident report . Police uncovered the two and noticed that the woman 's `` face was bruised , and their nose was bleeding , '' the report says .
Officers ordered Ajibade to release the woman , but they did not comply , the report says , adding that when police tried to arrest Ajibade , they proceeded to `` resist apprehension in a violent manner . ''
They were accused of domestic violence , battery and obstruction of an officer .
A woman whom they identified as their girlfriend tried to inform police of their mental health issues , O'Mara said .
`` She also gave police a bottle of their medication , '' the attorney said .
The police report notes that officers received a prescription bottle from the alleged victim , but the name of the prescription has been redacted .
Once at the jail , officials say , Ajibade had to be restrained , during which time they injured the three officers . They were then moved to an isolation cell because of their `` dangerous behavior , '' a police news release says .
Deputies conducted welfare checks on Ajibade and on their second check , they were found nonresponsive , police say . First aid was administered by the jail 's medical unit staff . Despite CPR and attempts to restart their heart with a defibrillator , Ajibade could not be revived , according to the release .
It 's unclear how much of the event , if any , was captured on the jail 's surveillance system , or whether officers conducted a mental health evaluation before Ajibade 's death .
County government officials declined CNN requests for an interview , citing the ongoing investigation .
The Sheriff 's Office has requested that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation conduct an independent investigation . A GBI spokesperson said an autopsy had been conducted , but that a cause of death was pending toxicology reports .
The Chatham County District Attorney 's Office said a criminal investigation is ongoing and the office will `` handle the matter further , should it become necessary . ''
Stephen Elop Business Insider Nokia announced three new Android phones under the `` Nokia X '' brand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona today , a departure from its heavy reliance on Microsoft 's Windows Phone 8 operating system .
The move was surprising since Microsoft is in the process of acquiring Nokia 's phone and tablet business in a $ 7.2 billion deal that should finalize early this year .
And it 's clear Microsoft is n't too happy with Nokia 's decision to go Android .
When rumors started swirling about Nokia 's Android phones a few weeks ago , one Microsoft insider told us the move was `` embarrassing . ''
During a press conference at MWC Saturday , Joe Belfiore , Microsoft 's corporate vice president of Windows Phone , commented on Nokia 's Android devices in front of a room full of reporters and analysts .
`` They 'll do some things we 're excited about , and some things we 're less excited about , '' Belfiore said when asked about Nokia 's Android ambitions .
Nokia 's Android phones are a bit different from your typical Android phone though . The devices run heavily modified software and do n't have access to Google services like Google Maps , Gmail , and the Google Play Store for apps . Instead , the Nokia X phones are packed with Microsoft services like Outlook , Skype , and the online storage service OneDrive . They 'll have a separate app store for Android apps .
Nokia 's former CEO Stephen Elop — who will join Microsoft once the acquisition goes through — announced the Nokia X phones today and explained that they will act as an affordable gateway to Microsoft 's Windows Phones and other services . The cheapest Nokia X phone will cost about $ 120 U.S. and sell in `` emerging markets '' where most people still use regular feature phones . Nokia sees this as a good thing for Microsoft in the long run .
But there 's a problem with that reasoning . Nokia already makes Windows Phones that sell for ~ $ 100 , and those devices are very popular . The Nokia Lumia 520 , a budget-friendly Windows Phone , is said to be the top-selling device in its category .
Meanwhile , Microsoft 's communications boss Frank Shaw wrote a carefully worded blog post saying the company is happy Nokia decided to promote Microsoft services in the Nokia X phones . But they still write that , `` our primary smartphone strategy remains Windows Phone , and our core device platform for developers is the Windows platform . ''
The big question on everyone 's mind : Once the Nokia acquisition goes through , will Microsoft allow Nokia to continue making Android phones ?

Jaws dropped , mine included , when the Premier League held a press conference last Wednesday at the Landmark Hotel in London to announce they had sold their UK live TV rights for 2013-16 to Sky and BT – for £3.018bn .
This represented a staggering increase of a bit more than £1.2bn over the cash paid by Sky and ESPN for the three years , 2010-13 .
I 've been following these auctions closely , in a professional sense , since the mid-1990s , and did not expect a leap like this .
The only circumstances in which I thought it might happen would be if the sports arm of Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera got involved . Their petro-dollar billions would allow them to pay astronomical sums and a bidding war pitting Sky against Al Jazeera might have been truly spectacular .
In fact , according to sources , Al Jazeera did not bid this time . And if they did , it was half-heartedly and low at best ; which again suggests they did n't bid at all .
As one source told me : “ They did n't step up in the end , not this time . ”
Al Jazeera already have one new rights venture to manage : they 've bought live domestic rights to French Ligue 1 , a competition where Qatari interests own PSG .
And I 'm told that Al Jazeera also want to get hold of the Premier League 's rights in the Middle East , for which their could be some tussle with the Abu Dhabi holders , whose relatives own Manchester City .
So what happened to push up the UK rights this time ?
BT came to the party instead , and went ‘ toe to toe ' with Sky in an audacious effort to snatch a majority of the Premier League 's best games from the broadcaster that has bankrolled the Premier League since it began in 1992-93 .
So serious were BT , according to sources , that after one round of bidding , only two of the seven packages had been allocated : one each to Sky and BT .
What does that mean ? It means that BT and Sky ( and perhaps ESPN ) were bidding sums too close to separate on the other five packages .
In the end , Sky dug deep into their pockets to deliver bids that earned them five of the seven packages available while BT got the other two .
The bottom line for Sky : they will pay £2.28bn over three years from 2013-16 for 116 games per season , or in other words , get 348 games at £6,551,724 each .
The bottom line for BT : they will pay £738m over three years from 2013-16 for 38 games per season , or in other words , get 114 games at £6,473,684 each .
How on earth can this make any sense ?
How can these companies make this pay ?
What does it all mean for the Premier League clubs ?
And what about the fans and viewers ?
Lets start with the way the rights were sold .
.
How did the Premier League sell the rights for 2013-16 ?
By auction . Anyone could bid and Sportingintelligence sources have confirmed that at least three major companies did : Sky , BT and ESPN .
There were seven packages of rights available and sealed bids were submitted in a highly regulated process .
After one round of bidding , BT had won one package and Sky had won one . This means there was ‘ clear water ' in the bids for those .
In the second round of bidding , Sky upped their offers to move clear in four other packages , while BT secured a second package .
The graphic here shows how those packages are divided up , when the games will be screened and who gets the pick of the games in each slot .
NB : The total costs paid for the rights by Sky ( £2.28bn ) and BT ( £738m ) have been confirmed at source by the broadcasters themselves . They have not confirmed the breakdown by package ; those figures are educated estimates .
( Article continues below )
.
What does ‘ first pick ' mean and how does that work ?
It means what it says .
There are 38 ‘ rounds ' of games , and barring unforeseen circumstances , 33 of them will fall on weekends and five either in midweek or on public holidays .
You can see from the graphic that on 20 of the weekends , Sky will get the first pick of that weekend 's fixtures to screen in there Sunday 4pm slot .
And on 13 of the weekends , it will be BT who get the first pick of games to screen in their 12.45pm Saturday lunchtime slot .
And in the other five ‘ rounds ' ( midweek and Bank holidays ) it will be BT getting the first pick .
So to simplify : there are 38 rounds of games and Sky will get the ‘ best ' game in 20 of them , and BT will get the best game in the other 18 .
Broadly speaking , that ‘ best ' game in any given round will be obvious . It will be Manchester United versus City , or versus Liverpool , or Arsenal , Chelsea or Tottenham . It will be a ‘ big six ' versus ‘ big six ' .
The second , third , fourth and fifth picks are self-explanatory .
There are limits to how many times each club can appear in each slot , but in effect the ‘ big ' teams will get shown a lot and the others less so .
.
Is it a surprise that BT have joined the auction in such a competitive manner ?
No , not when you think about why they are doing it .
This is a strategic decision to move bullishly into a marketplace – Premier League rights – through which they hope to sell other goods and services , namely internet access , phone calls , mobile services and TV packages .
Rupert Murdoch famously once said that premium live sport would be the “ battering ram ” that got pay-TV into people 's homes . And they have been proved emphatically right .
Premier League football was a key driver – probably the key driver – in selling pay-TV , in the UK at least .
And now BT hope they can use that same premium product to win themselves new customers .
Their aim is not solely to sell you a subscription to a few football matches but to persuade you that their whole package of services ( TV , broadband , phone ) is better , and better value than the packages you might currently be getting from Sky , Virgin or whoever .
As BT 's CEO Ian Livingston , says : “ BT is already investing £2.5bn in fibre broadband . Securing Premier League rights fits naturally with this , as consumers increasingly want to buy their broadband and entertainment services from a single provider . ”
It is not just about football . It is much , much more strategic and wide-ranging than that .
And it is a long-term project that will be funded from deep , deep pockets .
If you think that BSkyB is rich with revenues of £6.6bn or thereabouts and profits of £1bn or thereabouts , then look at BT 's numbers .
They have revenues of £19bn or thereabouts and profits of £2bn or thereabouts .
This is n't just about football : it 's about the future of telecommunications and they way we increasingly live mobile and interactive lives .
.
How does it stack up financially ?
Bear in mind that what follows are a broad brushstroke of how this works . But in essence , BSkyB has managed over two decades to get into a position where the rights largely pay for themselves .
How so ?
Let 's look at what they paid last time , for 2010-13 . They spent £1.623bn for three years for five packages of rights , of six available . That works out at £541m a year .
Sky recoups a big chunk of that immediately by selling their games to pubs , clubs , hotels and other ‘ public space ' buyers .
As I have detailed before , a spokesperson for the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers tells me there are 55,000 pubs and clubs in the UK , and that around 20,000 of them subscribe to Sky .
There are , apparently , 26 different pricing bands , but the ALMR says the average pub subscription cost is £15,000 per year , and on that basis Sky makes around £300m a year from the pub/club trade alone .
This will be bigger when hotels and gyms and other public screeners are added . And if the pub-club-hotel-gym trade does n't cover all the cost of the rights , then it covers a huge chunk .
On top of that , Sky makes money from its football-related sponsorship deal with Ford , and from adverts during games .
So an outlay of £541m a year is perhaps covered by as much as £400m income from these sources . Before a subscription is sold .
Again , bear in mind these are broad brushstroke numbers , but Sky has more than 10m customers in the UK and it is understood around 7m of them subscribe to premium sports channels that include Premier League football .
I know customers buy Sky for many reasons , not just football . That goes without saying .
But nonetheless , there are around 7m ‘ football ' customers of Sky , paying , for sake of argument , around £500 each per year for Sky services .
That 's £3.5bn in annual income .
Do the maths .
BT have done – and now they want a share of the Sky pie .
Which is why they bid so aggressively .
Sky in turn needed to bid aggressively back .
To lose the live football remains unthinkable for Sky . What if BT had won the lion 's share of the rights and a large chunk of 7m people had reconsidered whether they wanted to stick with Sky or move ?
BT are different from previous pretenders like Setanta because they have massive resources . It 's not solely about selling subscriptions to break even . It 's about a wider strategic aim .
.
So how will people watch games on BT ?
The details remain at the planning stage but BT will start a specialist sport channel on which the games will be shown .
I would expect it to be available via many platforms . You 'll probably be able to add it to a Sky package or a Virgin package . You 'll be able to subscribe at better rates if you take it via BT 's BT Vision , which currently has 700,000 customers .
And I 'd also expect the content to be increasingly mobile , ie : when you sign up you 'll be able to access games not just via your TV but via your computer , tablet , mobile and any other new device that arrives .
Sky of course will be doing the same . As they said in their press release last week : ‘ Sky has been awarded live rights across all platforms – including satellite , cable , IPTV , online and mobile . This means that , in addition to TV , Sky customers will continue to benefit from live Premier League coverage through Sky Go on PCs , laptops , smartphones , tablets and games consoles . Coverage will also be made available on Sky 's new internet TV service , NOW TV , which launches later this year . '
For Sky , also read BT .
They 're going head to head for your custom , using football as the driver .
As for cost , BT will decide on that later . But expect to pay more for the BT channel alone to add to your current package from another company , or less if you switch to BT for other services .
BT 's sports channel will also carry other live sport , to be confirmed dependent on what rights it can snap up . I 'd expect other football , probably from Europe and possible the Americas , and maybe other sports too .
.
What about overseas rights ?
The auction process for that has already started , with Scandinavian rights already sold for 2013-16 .
But with territory by territory deals being done ( around 81 of them last time for 2010-13 ) it will take months to conclude the process .
The Premier League made £1.437bn from overseas rights last time .
That will grow , with leaps expected in the Middle East , parts of Asia and north America particularly .
I would n't expect the overseas rights to double , as they did last time . But then again , who knows ?
I would expect total Premier League media revenues to rise from around £3.5bn in 2010-13 to way above £5bn and perhaps as much as £6bn for 2013-16 .
.
What happens to all the money ?
That 's another story , for another day .
But suffice to say , as the Premier League 's income from TV has soared these past 20 years , so has the average wage of the Premier League player , as the graphic below shows ( scroll down ) .

Lashing out at Narendra Modi for what they termed were their “ deep character flaws ” , Finance Minister P Chidambaram Monday said they wished they could have contested the Lok Sabha polls against the BJP 's prime ministerial candidate in Varanasi , but was constrained by their lack of knowledge of Hindi .

“ I wish I could have contested from Varanasi but I do n't speak Hindi and would n't be able to campaign in Hindi . I am sure Mr Modi would n't like to contest from Sivaganga either , ” Chidambaram told reporters when asked if they were willing to take on Modi from Varanasi .
The Congress is yet to declare a candidate from the constituency , although many leaders have expressed their willingness to contest from there . Chidambaram said the party was looking for a “ strong candidate ” to field against Modi in Varanasi .
Urban development secretary Sudhir Krishna had complained against Chidambaram earlier this year claiming the minister had humiliated them at a high-level meeting by telling them they could n't understand their English , and that Krishna should speak in Hindi instead .

Chidambaram , an MP from Sivaganga , is not contesting the elections this time and has vacated the seat for their son .
“ I have fought eight elections over the last 30 years . Now there are many other things I want to do in my life , ” they said , adding they were not retiring from politics and would continue to work for the party .
Taking on the Gujarat chief minister , Chidambaram said Modi had “ deep character flaws ” . “ He can not resist such derogatory remarks and perverse characterisation…I am ashamed such a person aspires to be PM and the party ( BJP ) that does n't point out these flaws to him , ” they said , referring to Modi 's remarks on Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the Italian marines .
They also pointed towards instances of “ perverse characterization ” by Modi , including of a former Chief Election Commissioner by calling them “ James Michael Lyngdoh ” in election meetings apparently referring to their religion . “ Referring to people practising a certain faith , they had said ‘ ham panch , hamare pachis ( we five , our 25 ) ' . When they referred to the Congress president sometime back , they said ‘ das numbari ' , ” Chidambaram said .
Asked about their views on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's statement that Modi becoming PM would be “ disastrous ” for the country , Chidambaram said they “ concurred ” with the view . “ He will be an earnest , hardworking , considerate and compassionate Prime Minister who runs a democratic cabinet , ” they said in response to a question about party vice-president Rahul Gandhi .
They also said it was wrong to say Modi had been given a “ clean chit ” on the Gujarat riots since the SIT report has been challenged in a higher court and the “ final word ” has not been said . They also said the SIT had a “ limited mandate ” .
Dismissing suggestions that corporates were unhappy with the Congress and were veering towards the BJP , the finance minister said , “ Corporates have no problem with us . Businesses are comfortable with the UPA and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh…But a section of big business is extremely comfortable with Mr Modi because their brand of capitalism is crony capitalism . ”
Launching a scathing attack on senior BJP leader and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha , who had posed 18 questions to him , Chidambaram said the questions were “ puerile ” . “ Mr Yashwant Sinha is a distant memory for the people of India and I hope they remain where is , ” they said .
Chidambaram said they would like to hand over the finance ministry to someone who also had a “ firm hand on the wheel ” .

“ I will keep a firm hand on the wheel and would like to hand over to another firm hand on the wheel , and am hopeful it will not be a man of the choice of Mr Narendra Modi , ” they said .
Earlier this Spring , Bolt Threads launched their first product – a necktie made of spider webs .
Born out of a curiosity for natural spider silk , Bolt Threads has developed a way to closely mimic silk created in nature by spiders for mass commercial production . They 're pioneering more sustainable and non-toxic processes for textile manufacturing . Last year , the company announced a $ 50 million round in Series C funding , along with a partnership with outdoors retailer Patagonia . We caught up with Co-Founder and CEO Dan Widmaier to chat more about their innovative new material and new necktie .
FN : Tell us about Bolt Threads . What is the need in the market for your product/textile ?
DW : The team first became interested in spider silk during a Ph.D. program at UCSF and UC Berkeley in 2004 . Spider silk is one of the most interesting materials found in nature — it is massively strong and phenomenally lightweight . A spider makes six or seven different kinds of silks with different properties . It can be stronger than steel , stretchier than spandex , and softer than wool . We wanted to create a manmade spider silk from renewable ingredients — something as strong and durable , yet eco-friendly .
The textile industry is responsible for monumentally high levels of pollution and water usage . In fact , 25 % of all chemicals produced worldwide are used in the dyeing and finishing of textiles . Through our proprietary technology , we 've developed a way to closely mimic silk created in nature for mass commercial production , developing a more sustainable and non-toxic processes for textile manufacturing .
FN : Sustainability has become a big buzzword in fashion . What does sustainability mean to you and how is Bolt Threads a sustainable brand ?
Most of the synthetic textiles that are produced today have highly toxic processes , using petroleum-based polymers and non-renewable materials . At Bolt , we are working toward a closed-loop production , ensuring that we utilize renewable solutions that can be sustainably mass produced . Our manmade spider silk is made from three renewable ingredients : yeast , sugar , and water .
FN : You have a partnership with Patagonia , what does that partnership entail ? Are there any other exciting partnerships coming down the pipeline ?
DW : We are still working with Patagonia , and the material used in the tie is one step in the process of producing materials that meet Patagonia 's specifications for commercial launch . We do have some exciting news coming down the pipeline , however I ca n't reveal too much at the moment . Stay tuned !
FN : You recently announced your very first prototype product that you launched at earlier this year at SXSW , a knit , spider silk , unisex tie . What made you decide to choose the tie as your foray into the market ?
DW : We wanted to produce a festive , memorable item . We chose a tie because we wanted to create an iconic product associated with the history of silk . The Boltspun silk knit necktie honors this history .
FN : What makes this tie so special ? What went into the 7 years of building this product ?
DW : The Boltspun knit necktie will not stop a bullet , but it does mark a milestone that this technology is now becoming reality . We now know that we can mass produce the fiber , make it into a yarn , knit it , dye it , and more . The tie itself is comprised of dragline spider silk , it 's about 90 km of filament , and the aesthetic design pattern of the product is inspired by the microstructure of the protein beta sheets the material is composed of . We had quite a bit of fun with it .
It 's been a long time coming . Over the past few years we 've really focused on research and scaling . As a new company and with an entirely new process , we 've built almost everything behind manufacturing the product . The tie product launch signifies the end of a chapter for our research phase and the beginning of our foray into making really unique products for consumers and partners alike .
FN : What does the future look like for Bolt Threads ? Where do you see the company in 5 years time ?
DW : We ca n't say too much ! This is just the beginning for us . Expect to see more products , higher volume , and a broader distribution over time . Our greatest goal for the coming years is to scale to a point where the technology is ubiquitous , and to create more applications for the technology to solve problems .
Merkel said banks should be recapitalised as quickly as possible if required , as concerns grow that the eurozone debt crisis is spilling over into a credit crunch .
`` I think there would be a very clear need [ to recapitalise ] because this is money that is safely invested , '' Merkel said , adding , `` I do n't think we should hesitate . ''
There would be `` far greater damage '' if banks needed to be rescued by governments , they said .
`` But the first step is for banks to recapitalise themselves , '' they stressed .
Later , they said the EU 's bailout fund , the European Financial Stability Fund , could step in to provide more cash to banks but `` only under very certain conditions ... and only if the euro as a whole were to be threatened . ''
`` I would like to recall that the EFSF is a facility which serves to provide assistance at a point in time when a country would threaten the stability of the euro and the eurozone as a whole , '' the chancellor said .
Them comments came after European Commission President José Manuel Barroso suggested on Thursday a coordinated effort be made to recapitalise banks .
They had already made similar signals in Brussels Wednesday that helping the banks was `` justified , if we have a joint approach '' giving nervous financial markets an immediate boost after days of heavy losses .
The statement came after France and Belgium were forced to leap to the rescue of cross-border bank Dexia , the first European bank to be dragged down by the eurozone debt crisis - and which also had to be bailed out in 2008 .
As the euro crisis continues unabated , Merkel was set to meet head of the International Monetary Fund , Christine Lagarde as well as European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and World Bank President Robert Zoellick to talk about reforming the currency system .
Merkel 's vice chancellor , Economy Minister Philipp Rösler arrived in Greece on Thursday with a delegation of around 50 Germany business representatives . They called for the Greek government to remove hurdles to foreign investments more quickly , and held out the prospect of German industry helping the Greeks to expand their solar energy business .
But Rösler said there was little prospect of external investment if the Greeks themselves were not showing confidence in their country . “ He who wants external investors , must of course be ready to invest domestically , ” they told the ZDF television station just before leaving Germany .

Malthus , a Meal a Day . Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying About the Food and Love the ( Population ) Bomb .
As designers we give ideas a form and we transform them into things . We ca n't certainly solve the world 's challenges , but what we can do is to create a concrete storytelling about them . A narrative .
Malthus is one of these tales . It is an in-home aquaponics unit designed for the next generation kitchen or living room . It grows one meal a day : a portion of fish and a side salad . Aquaponics farming is a technique that combines the cultivation of fish with the growing of vegetables . The fish provides rich fertilizer for the plants and in return , the plants clean the water from the tank . The fish and the plants co-exist in a symbiotic relationship .
Malthus is an appliance for the kitchen of the future that grows food right next to where you cook it . Malthus consists of a fish tank that holds 400 litres which can support more than 2kg of fish like tilapia , salmon , grey fish or carp . The water is pumped through three cultivated grow beds which filter the water for the fish .
Malthus is designed to optimize space and costs with indoor food production . The weight of the fish tank is comparable to the one of a full bathtub , its width is about the size of two small refrigerators . Its parts are made of elements available in most DIY stores .

Malthus # 01 was built thanks to the collaboration of Ola Nilsson and presented for the first time at the 10th edition of NESS – Nordic Environmental Social Sciences Conference – Stockholm 14th -16th June 2011 within the context of the exhibition “ Power Landscapes ” curated by Po Hangström . The theme of the conference is also the theme of an art project where the invited artists ( Katia Aglert , New Beauty Council , Cristine Ödlund ) presented works on design as a tool for social and environmental engagement .
Malthus has a planned production limited to 100 numbered pieces . The first piece ( Malthus # 00 ) is the prototype currently running in our office in Zurich , thanks to Laura Vargalyte , our intern . The design and the production factors of Malthus have been made possible by the technical support of Andreas Graber from UrbanFarmers and Head of the Aquaponics project of the Zurich University of Applied Science who has introduced us to urban farming and to Aquaponics techniques .
A special acknowledgement goes to Stefano Massa for making things run smoothly throughout the project . This text has been kindly edited with the collaboration of Liz Henry Economou of Nuance Words .

NEW ORLEANS -- Using cash at the Office of Motor Vehicles was n't just more convenient for some drivers , it was cheaper . After the OMV stopped accepting cash this month , drivers found out that the payment methods they do accept will now cost them an extra fee .
Starting this month , OMVs in Louisiana no longer accept cash as payments for any vehicle transactions . Residents can only pay for driver 's licenses , identification cards , vehicle transactions , reinstatement transactions and mobility-impaired hang tags with debit or credit cards , money orders , checks or cashier 's checks .
Agency Commissioner Karen St. Germain said the cash ban saves the state a fortune in overtime spent counting the 100 million dollars they used to collect each year .
`` We pay about $ 300,000 a year to support that cash , between the overtime and the banking fees that they charge us , and also the armored car that costs $ 120,000 a year just to deliver the cash , '' St. Germain explained .
Hannah Hamblen only carries cash , so they had to appeal to a friend for help and then got a second surprise .
`` ( I had to ) get somebody that has a card that I can use , '' Hannah said , but on top of the cost , they charged them a convenience fee for using a card . `` Now I owe them the extra fee ! ''
It 's a small fee , one dollar to pay by check , or for credit and debit cards a dollar and a quarter plus one percent of the transaction . The Commissioner said the state is just passing along what they are being charged .
`` At the end of the day if we had to pay those fees to the vendors that handle this information , it would be about $ 15 million a year , '' St. Germain explained .
`` Most places that accept credit cards charge you a fee , '' Noel Jefferson said . `` I do n't like it , but I 've got to go along with it . ''
A money order or a cashier 's check will also be accepted .
Commissioner St. Germain said they understand the early confusion caused by the policy change to ban cash at OMV offices , but added they expect drivers to become used to the changes .
Reports are coming in today of a now former Williamsville Illinois High School Science Teacher was released from their duties with the district around 11:00am yesterday morning .
Callie Sturgeon aka Callie Marie aka Cassideestarr
According to several sources Callie was allegedly found appearing all over the internet on adult website , starting sometime last school year .
The video in question pictured above has been removed as of today from the infamous PornHub Website .
A look at the school districts website shows Callie has been removed from the staff roster ( Click Here To See The Roster ) .
A simple Google Search of that stage name also brings up several of the Free Webcam videos , and images . Questionably it looks to be some of the videos were filmed in a classroom setting ! We have reached out to David J. Root , Superintendent of the Williamsville/Sherman School District for comment , but at time of publishing no official comment has been returned . We attempted to reach out as well to Callie and they did not return our messages for comment . At this time there is no indication that any wrong doing happened directly with any students where criminal charges could be for coming . More to come on this developing story !

The first 10 categories are fairly straightforward . The AI looks at the current state of the game ( how much culture/armor/attack/economy each player has and what round it currently is ) and tries to find the card that will best benefit it .
Abilities
The last 7 categories attempt to handle Abilities , which are trickier . It is assumed that the cost of each card is fair and accurately reflects its value under ordinary circumstances , so the AI is basically looking for extraordinary circumstances to take advantage of . If it has a lot of Infantry cards , then Shieldwall is a high value card since that ability represents a combo opportunity with Infantry cards .
Categories 11-16 ( combos and counters ) handle most card abilities , and for a long time that seemed okay enough . But it eventually became obvious that for some cards it 's harder to describe what a combo or counter is , and so category 17 was added to provide custom logic for those cards . Examples include Plaguebearer , Master Thief and The Oracle . These are cards that you should only buy under very specific circumstances , and if the AI buys one when it should n't , it can ruin the illusion of intelligence completely . About 25 cards have such custom logic .
The first version of the AI probably only had about half of these categories . Whenever I embarked upon a series of AI improvements , I would simply play a game and wait for the AI to do something that seemed obviously sub-optimal , and then I would analyze its logic to figure out why it made that choice . This usually resulted in a re-write of a category , the addition of a new one , or the adjusting of weights .
Assigning Damage
Combat damage assignment follows a similar pattern , but with only 10 categories . The AI randomly assigns damage and then calculates the total value of the cards left over . It does this 1000 times and then picks the permutation that resulted in the highest total value . I probably could have done this in a more rigorous way , but in practice it seemed to work pretty well so I never improved it .
Introduction
Consider an application , such as a web site , with support for multiple languages in its user interface . When a user arrives with a list of preferred languages , the application must decide which language it should use in its presentation to the user . This requires finding the best match between the languages the application supports and those the user prefers . This post explains why this is a difficult decision and how Go can help .
Language Tags
Language tags , also known as locale identifiers , are machine-readable identifiers for the language and/or dialect being used . The most common reference for them is the IETF BCP 47 standard , and that is the standard the Go libraries follow . Here are some examples of BCP 47 language tags and the language or dialect they represent .
Tag Description en English en-US American English cmn Mandarin Chinese zh Chinese , typically Mandarin nl Dutch nl-BE Flemish es-419 Latin American Spanish az , az-Latn both Azerbaijani written in Latin script az-Arab Azerbaijani written in Arabic
The general form of the language tag is a language code ( “ en ” , “ cmn ” , “ zh ” , “ nl ” , “ az ” above ) followed by an optional subtag for script ( “ -Arab ” ) , region ( “ -US ” , “ -BE ” , “ -419 ” ) , variants ( “ -oxendict ” for Oxford English Dictionary spelling ) , and extensions ( “ -u-co-phonebk ” for phone-book sorting ) . The most common form is assumed if a subtag is omitted , for instance “ az-Latn-AZ ” for “ az ” .
The most common use of language tags is to select from a set of system-supported languages according to a list of the user 's language preferences , for example deciding that a user who prefers Afrikaans would be best served ( assuming Afrikaans is not available ) by the system showing Dutch . Resolving such matches involves consulting data on mutual language comprehensibility .
The tag resulting from this match is subsequently used to obtain language-specific resources such as translations , sorting order , and casing algorithms . This involves a different kind of matching . For example , as there is no specific sorting order for Portuguese , a collage package may fall back to the sorting order for the default , or “ root ” , language .
The Messy Nature of Matching Languages
Handling language tags is tricky . This is partly because the boundaries of human languages are not well defined and partly because of the legacy of evolving language tag standards . In this section we will show some of the messy aspects of handling language tags .
Tags with different language codes can indicate the same language
For historical and political reasons , many language codes have changed over time , leaving languages with an older legacy code as well as a new one . But even two current codes may refer to the same language . For example , the official language code for Mandarin is “ cmn ” , but “ zh ” is by far the most commonly used designator for this language . The code “ zh ” is officially reserved for a so-called macro language , identifying the group of Chinese languages . Tags for macro languages are often used interchangeably with the most-spoken language in the group .
Matching language code alone is not sufficient
Azerbaijani ( “ az ” ) , for example , is written in different scripts depending on the country in which it is spoken : `` az-Latn '' for Latin ( the default script ) , `` az-Arab '' for Arabic , and “ az-Cyrl ” for Cyrillic . If you replace `` az-Arab '' with just `` az '' , the result will be in Latin script and may not be understandable to a user who only knows the Arabic form .
Also different regions may imply different scripts . For example : “ zh-TW ” and “ zh-SG ” respectively imply the use of Traditional and Simplified Han . As another example , “ sr ” ( Serbian ) defaults to Cyrillic script , but “ sr-RU ” ( Serbian as written in Russia ) implies the Latin script ! A similar thing can be said for Kyrgyz and other languages .
If you ignore subtags , you might as well present Greek to the user .
The best match might be a language not listed by the user
The most common written form of Norwegian ( “ nb ” ) looks an awful lot like Danish . If Norwegian is not available , Danish may be a good second choice . Similarly , a user requesting Swiss German ( “ gsw ” ) will likely be happy to be presented German ( “ de ” ) , though the converse is far from true . A user requesting Uygur may be happier to fall back to Chinese than to English . Other examples abound . If a user-requested language is not supported , falling back to English is often not the best thing to do .
The choice of language decides more than translation
Suppose a user asks for Danish , with German as a second choice . If an application chooses German , it must not only use German translations but also use German ( not Danish ) collation . Otherwise , for example , a list of animals might sort “ Bär ” before “ Äffin ” .
Selecting a supported language given the user 's preferred languages is like a handshaking algorithm : first you determine which protocol to communicate in ( the language ) and then you stick with this protocol for all communication for the duration of a session .
Using a “ parent ” of a language as fallback is non-trivial
Suppose your application supports Angolan Portuguese ( “ pt-AO ” ) . Packages in golang.org/x/text , like collation and display , may not have specific support for this dialect . The correct course of action in such cases is to match the closest parent dialect . Languages are arranged in a hierarchy , with each specific language having a more general parent . For example , the parent of “ en-GB-oxendict ” is “ en-GB ” , whose parent is “ en ” , whose parent is the undefined language “ und ” , also known as the root language . In the case of collation , there is no specific collation order for Portugese , so the collate package will select the sorting order of the root language . The closest parent to Angolan Portuguese supported by the display package is European Portuguese ( “ pt-PT ” ) and not the more obvious “ pt ” , which implies Brazilian .
In general , parent relationships are non-trivial . To give a few more examples , the parent of “ es-CL ” is “ es-419 ” , the parent of “ zh-TW ” is “ zh-Hant ” , and the parent of “ zh-Hant ” is “ und ” . If you compute the parent by simply removing subtags , you may select a “ dialect ” that is incomprehensible to the user .
Language Matching in Go
The Go package golang.org/x/text/language implements the BCP 47 standard for language tags and adds support for deciding which language to use based on data published in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository ( CLDR ) .
Here is a sample program , explained below , matching a user 's language preferences against an application 's supported languages :
package main import ( `` fmt '' `` golang.org/x/text/language '' `` golang.org/x/text/language/display '' ) var userPrefs = [ ] language.Tag { language.Make ( `` gsw '' ) , // Swiss German language.Make ( `` fr '' ) , // French } var serverLangs = [ ] language.Tag { language.AmericanEnglish , // en-US fallback language.German , // de } var matcher = language.NewMatcher ( serverLangs ) func main ( ) { tag , index , confidence : = matcher.Match ( userPrefs ... ) fmt.Printf ( `` the best match : % s ( % s ) index= % d confidence= % v
`` , display.English.Tags ( ) .Name ( tag ) , display.Self.Name ( tag ) , index , confidence ) // the best match : German ( Deutsch ) index=1 confidence=High }
Creating Language Tags
The simplest way to create a language.Tag from a user-given language code string is with language.Make . It extracts meaningful information even from malformed input . For example , “ en-USD ” will result in “ en ” even though USD is not a valid subtag .
Make does n't return an error . It is common practice to use the default language if an error occurs anyway so this makes it more convenient . Use Parse to handle any error manually .
The HTTP Accept-Language header is often used to pass a user 's desired languages . The ParseAcceptLanguage function parses it into a slice of language tags , ordered by preference .
By default , the language package does not canonicalize tags . For example , it does not follow the BCP 47 recommendation of eliminating scripts if it is the common choice in the “ overwhelming majority ” . It similarly ignores CLDR recommendations : “ cmn ” is not replaced by “ zh ” and “ zh-Hant-HK ” is not simplified to “ zh-HK ” . Canonicalizing tags may throw away useful information about user intent . Canonicalization is handled in the Matcher instead . A full array of canonicalization options are available if the programmer still desires to do so .
Matching User-Preferred Languages to Supported Languages
A Matcher matches user-preferred languages to supported languages . Users are strongly advised to use it if they do n't want to deal with all the intricacies of matching languages .
The Match method may pass through user settings ( from BCP 47 extensions ) from the preferred tags to the selected supported tag . It is therefore important that the tag returned by Match is used to obtain language-specific resources . For example , “ de-u-co-phonebk ” requests phone-book ordering for German . The extension is ignored for matching , but is used by the collate package to select the respective sorting order variant .
A Matcher is initialized with the languages supported by an application , which are usually the languages for which there are translations . This set is typically fixed , allowing a matcher to be created at startup . Matcher is optimized to improve the performance of Match at the expense of initialization cost .
The language package provides a predefined set of the most commonly used language tags that can be used for defining the supported set . Users generally do n't have to worry about the exact tags to pick for supported languages . For example , AmericanEnglish ( “ en-US ” ) may be used interchangeably with the more common English ( “ en ” ) , which defaults to American . It is all the same for the Matcher . An application may even add both , allowing for more specific American slang for “ en-US ” .
Matching Example
Consider the following Matcher and lists of supported languages :
var supported = [ ] language.Tag { language.AmericanEnglish , // en-US : first language is fallback language.German , // de language.Dutch , // nl language.Portuguese // pt ( defaults to Brazilian ) language.EuropeanPortuguese , // pt-pT language.Romanian // ro language.Serbian , // sr ( defaults to Cyrillic script ) language.SerbianLatin , // sr-Latn language.SimplifiedChinese , // zh-Hans language.TraditionalChinese , // zh-Hant } var matcher = language.NewMatcher ( supported )
Let 's look at the matches against this list of supported languages for various user preferences .
For a user preference of `` he '' ( Hebrew ) , the best match is `` en-US '' ( American English ) . There is no good match , so the matcher uses the fallback language ( the first in the supported list ) .
For a user preference of `` hr '' ( Croatian ) , the best match is `` sr-Latn '' ( Serbian with Latin script ) , because , once they are written in the same script , Serbian and Croatian are mutually intelligible .
For a user preference of `` ru , mo '' ( Russian , then Moldavian ) , the best match is `` ro '' ( Romanian ) , because Moldavian is now canonically classified as `` ro-MD '' ( Romanian in Moldova ) .
For a user preference of `` zh-TW '' ( Mandarin in Taiwan ) , the best match is `` zh-Hant '' ( Mandarin written in Traditional Chinese ) , not `` zh-Hans '' ( Mandarin written in Simplified Chinese ) .
For a user preference of `` af , ar '' ( Afrikaans , then Arabic ) , the best match is `` nl '' ( Dutch ) . Neither preference is supported directly , but Dutch is a significantly closer match to Afrikaans than the fallback language English is to either .
For a user preference of `` pt-AO , id '' ( Angolan Portuguese , then Indonesian ) , the best match is `` pt-PT '' ( European Portuguese ) , not `` pt '' ( Brazilian Portuguese ) .
For a user preference of `` gsw-u-co-phonebk '' ( Swiss German with phone-book collation order ) , the best match is `` de-u-co-phonebk '' ( German with phone-book collation order ) . German is the best match for Swiss German in the server 's language list , and the option for phone-book collation order has been carried over .
Confidence Scores
Go uses coarse-grained confidence scoring with rule-based elimination . A match is classified as Exact , High ( not exact , but no known ambiguity ) , Low ( probably the correct match , but maybe not ) , or No . In case of multiple matches , there is a set of tie-breaking rules that are executed in order . The first match is returned in the case of multiple equal matches . These confidence scores may be useful , for example , to reject relatively weak matches . They are also used to score , for example , the most likely region or script from a language tag .
Implementations in other languages often use more fine-grained , variable-scale scoring . We found that using coarse-grained scoring in the Go implementation ended up simpler to implement , more maintainable , and faster , meaning that we could handle more rules .
Displaying Supported Languages
The golang.org/x/text/language/display package allows naming language tags in many languages . It also contains a “ Self ” namer for displaying a tag in its own language .
For example :
var supported = [ ] language.Tag { language.English , // en language.French , // fr language.Dutch , // nl language.Make ( `` nl-BE '' ) , // nl-BE language.SimplifiedChinese , // zh-Hans language.TraditionalChinese , // zh-Hant language.Russian , // ru } en : = display.English.Tags ( ) for _ , t : = range supported { fmt.Printf ( `` % -20s ( % s )
`` , en.Name ( t ) , display.Self.Name ( t ) ) }
prints
English ( English ) French ( français ) Dutch ( Nederlands ) Flemish ( Vlaams ) Simplified Chinese ( 简体中文 ) Traditional Chinese ( 繁體中文 ) Russian ( русский )
In the second column , note the differences in capitalization , reflecting the rules of the respective language .
Conclusion
At first glance , language tags look like nicely structured data , but because they describe human languages , the structure of relationships between language tags is actually quite complex . It is often tempting , especially for English-speaking programmers , to write ad-hoc language matching using nothing other than string manipulation of the language tags . As described above , this can produce awful results .
Go 's golang.org/x/text/language package solves this complex problem while still presenting a simple , easy-to-use API . Enjoy .

CLEVELAND -- Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose is n't holding in their frustration any longer .
After watching their team give another lackluster effort and lose for the sixth time in the past eight games with a 108-94 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night , the former MVP delivered some emotional words .
Editor 's Picks Friedell : Thibodeau has n't lost team Frustration is building in Chicago , but the Bulls ' slide is n't enough for the team to lose faith in Tom Thibodeau , writes Nick Friedell .
Why Bulls , Cavs still favorites in East Despite underachieving , the Bulls and Cavs have the stars , depth and time to fulfill expectations and meet in the East finals , writes Brian Windhorst . 1 Related
`` Everybody has to be on the same page , '' Rose said . `` Until then , we 're going to continue to get our ass kicked . ''
Asked who was not on the same page , Rose was quick with a response .
`` It 's just the whole team , '' they said .
The Bulls canceled practice on Tuesday .
Rose 's comments come amid one of the worst stretches of the Tom Thibodeau era .
The part that irritates players and coaches is n't so much the losing , especially given that the Bulls are playing without starters Joakim Noah ( knee/ankle ) and Mike Dunleavy ( ankle ) . It 's that they 're not playing with the type of intensity that has come to define them over Thibodeau 's five years as coach in Chicago .
`` I think communication is huge , '' Rose said . `` We 're quiet when we 're out there , and it 's leading to them getting easy baskets . We got to give a better effort . It seems like we 're not even competing , and it 's f -- -ing irritating . ''
Thibodeau did n't mince words while discussing their team 's most recent disappointing performance .
`` We got to decide when enough 's enough , '' Thibodeau said . `` The way we 're playing is not acceptable , so we have to change it . ''
Rose did n't buy the notion that because the Bulls have new pieces , notably Pau Gasol , Nikola Mirotic and Aaron Brooks , and continue to play through injuries , those issues explain why their team continues to falter after a stretch last month in which it won 13 of 15 games .
Unhappy New Year For Bulls The Bulls ' defense has not been the same since the calendar turned to 2015 , as they 've gone from having the fifth-best field goal percentage defense to the fifth-worst .
Bulls ' NBA Ranks This Season 2014 2015 Defensive efficiency 10th 25th Defensive FG pct . 5th 26th Defensive reb . pct . 17th 26th > > Bulls : 22-10 in 2014 , 5-6 in 2015
`` We 're midway through the season , '' Rose said . `` That should be a part of [ the discussion ] . There are no excuses . My biggest thing is competing . Playing this game for so long , when you do n't have that edge , we 're going to keep getting our ass whupped . ''
As far as the communication goes , Gasol acknowledged the Bulls might need to talk to one another more off the floor to figure out what 's happening on it .
`` We try to do that amongst ourselves , '' Gasol said . `` We have done it , but we got to do it more . It 's part of the process of what 's going on , understanding the type of team we have and improving . ''
The recent slide comes as the Bulls enter a challenging spot in the schedule . They have games against San Antonio and Dallas this week before a home game against Miami on Sunday that leads into a West Coast swing , which starts against the Golden State Warriors a week from Tuesday .
`` We 're not playing well in any aspect of the game , so we 're not giving ourselves a chance to win , '' Thibodeau said . `` Usually if you 're playing great defense and you 're rebounding the ball and keeping your turnovers down , you 're going to be in position to win no matter who you 're playing against , no matter where you 're playing . No matter who 's playing .
`` But if you do n't do those three things , then you 're not going to be in position to win . We 've been able to overcome injuries because we 've been able to do that . Right now we 're not a multiple-effort team , we 're not concentrating , we 're not doing our job . We got to change that . We got to change it . ''
We started using Zabbix to monitor the IT infrastructure at The University of Oslo in 2014 . During all this time we have been running all our Zabbix servers on VMware virtual servers with an acceptable level of performance . This situation changed some months ago when the VMvare+Storage we were using did not have more available resources for us to grow and it was slowing down the future development of our monitoring system .
This is why we decided to move some parts of our Zabbix infrastructure to dedicated servers . The Zabbix database , server and proxies are running on pyshical servers now while the web/API servers are still running on virtual servers .
The server we got to run the zabbix-server and database was a Dell PowerEdge R730xd with these main specifications :
2 x E5-2690 v4 @ 2.60GHz ( 28cores )
512GB ECC RAM
Controller PERC H730
OS : 2 x 200GB RAID-1 SSD SATA 6Gbps ( SSDSC2BX200G4R ) .
DATA : 2 x 1.6TB RAID-1 SSD SAS 12Gbps ( Toshiba PX05SMB160Y ) .
With a powerful server and the amount of data our Zabbix installation was processing it was very important to tune PostgreSQL to take advantage of the resources we had available . One of the main components in Zabbix is the database and a poor performance will affect the whole system , we used the information we had in our old virtual database server in production to calculate most of the configuration values for the new one and we focused on 4 areas :
Checkpoints Autovacuum & autoanalyze Parallel processing Temp files .
Checkpoints
PostgreSQL uses WAL ( write-ahead log ) to provide durability of our data and to perform a database recovery in case of a crash .
When a change is done in the database , PostgreSQL registers the change to the WAL and flushes this data to disk right away while changes to data files are done only in memory and flushed to disk later in the background . This is done to increase performance .
The process of flushing the changes in memory to the data files and registering this moment into the WAL stream is called a checkpoint . When a checkpoint is finished , old WAL information is not necessary anymore because the changes registered in the WAL before the checkpoint have been saved into the data files .
Because a checkpoint can be very demanding and can generate a high IO in your server if it is not done properly , we do not want them to occur too often , to avoid IO load , or wait too much , to minimize the recovery time in case of a crash . A checkpoint can be triggered i.a . by :
Reaching an amount of time since the last checkpoint . Generating an amount of WAL since the last checkpoint .
We want to trigger a checkpoint by time so we can control when they occur , values around 30 min . between checkpoints are common in busy databases . We also want to configure enough WAL space so we do not use all the WAL space available before our time limit .
Depending on the amount of data your Zabbix installation collects , you can generate large amounts of WAL files . The good thing with Zabbix is that the data flow is very predictable , it depends in particular on the amount of items you have and the update interval of these items . You can see in the following graphs the amount of values and transactions processed by Zabbix in our system , as you can see they are very predictable .
Zabbix values processed / sec
PostgreSQL transactions / sec - ZabbixDB
What we did to find out the amount of WAL data generated during an hour was to use the WAL information available in our database :
# psql -c `` SELECT pg_current_xlog_insert_location ( ) '' & & sleep 3600 & & psql -c `` SELECT pg_current_xlog_insert_location ( ) '' pg_current_xlog_insert_location -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - FC26/8993A100 ( 1 row ) pg_current_xlog_insert_location -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - FC2C/2AAF1DE8 ( 1 row ) SELECT pg_size_pretty ( pg_xlog_location_diff ( 'FC2C/2AAF1DE8 ' , 'FC26/8993A100 ' ) ) ; pg_size_pretty -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 23 GB ( 1 row )
As you can see we generated around 23GB of WALs during this hour , including a zabbix housekeeping process execution . This means that if we are going to use a 30 min . checkpoint timeout , we would need 12GB or more of WAL space to not trigger a checkpoint before our 30 min . timeout . There are two PostgreSQL parameters to control this :
checkpoint_timeout : In our case checkpoint_timeout = 30min
: In our case max_wal_size : In our case max_wal_size = 75GB . This parameter defines the WAL size for 2-3 checkpoints ( 3 x 12GB = 36GB ) . And because we are planning to double the amount of data we are going to monitor , 36GB x 2 = 72GB ≈ 75GB .
Another thing we wanted to do was to spread the checkpoint work to minimize IO . For this we used the PG parameter checkpoint_completion_target to control how much time the database had to write all the dirty buffers in memory to disk .
We used checkpoint_completion_target = 0.93 in our system . This means that PostgreSQL will throttle the writes so the last one will be done after 28min . ( 30min . x 0.93 ) and the OS will still have around 2 min . to flush the data to disk in the background , more than enough if we use the default value of 30 sec . for the linux kernel parameter vm.dirty_expire_centisecs = 3000 .
This is a graph that shows a healthy checkpoint configuration . You can see that most of the checkpoints are triggered by time occurring every 30 min .
Healthy PostgreSQL checkpoints configuration
Autovacuum & autoanalyze
Autovacuum and autoanalyze is another area we had to take care of to avoid performance problems with Zabbix .
PostgreSQL uses Multiversion Concurrency Control ( MVCC ) to provide concurrent access to the database . One of the side effects of this technique is that all deletes and updates done in the database will leave 'dead ' tuples ( rows ) marked as deleted but actually not deleted from the disk . Dead tuples will not be visible to transactions but will use and waste disk space , what we call “ bloat ” in PostgreSQL . This will affect how much disk space we use and will slow down queries if we do not do something to reclaim this 'dead ' space .
Zabbix has some tables that usually have a lot of data and suffer many deletes/updates queries , e.g . the tables events , history , history_uint , trends and trends_uint . These tables will be specially affected by bloat and a correct configuration of autovacuum is essential for a smooth operation .
There are two things we have to take care of when configuring autovacuum :
How often we clean up dead tuples . How many dead tuples we can clean up in a period of time minimizing the cleanup impact in our system .
How often we clean up dead tuples can be defined globally or per table . We decided to define it globally to avoid extra administration and to avoid changing the default DDL definition of the database delivered by Zabbix .
There are two parameters that decide when to start vacuuming a table , autovacuum_vacuum_threshold and autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor . The first one defines the minimum number of tuples that have to be dead and the second the percentage of dead tuples in the table before PostgreSQL starts autovacuuming the table . In our case we used autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 50 and autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01 . This means that PostgreSQL will start cleaning a table if the amount of dead tuples is over 1 % and at least 50 tuples are dead .
How many dead tuples we can clean up in a period of time and the cleanup impact in our system is controlled by the autovacuum throttling functionality . The cleanup is a maintenance task running in the background and it should have a minimum impact on user queries .
The autovacuum throttling is controlled by the parameters autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay and autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit . The first one defines the length of time that the autovacuum process will sleep when a cost limit has been exceeded , and the second one defines the accumulated cost that will cause the autovacuum process to sleep when it reaches the limit .
The cost is estimated using the values of these parameters :
vacuum_cost_page_hit = 1
vacuum_cost_page_miss = 10
vacuum_cost_page_dirty = 20 .
In our case we used autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 20ms and autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 3000 . This means that we will be able to process 150,000 ( 1000/20 * 3000 ) cost units per second . This translates to 1,171MB/s ( 150,000 x 8 / 1024 ) reads from shared_buffers , 117MB/s ( 150,000 x 8 / 1024 / 10 ) reads from OS ( possibly from disk ) and 58MB/s ( 150,000 x 8 / 1024 / 20 ) writes of pages dirtied by the autovacuum process . These values are more than enough for our load and can be processed without problems by our SSD disks .
In addition we defined autovacuum_max_workers = 6 and maintenance_work_mem = 8G , this will use in the worst case around 48GB of memory for autovacuum jobs .
This SQL query shows the amount and percent of dead tuples in your tables :
SELECT relname , n_live_tup , n_dead_tup , n_dead_tup * 100/n_live_tup : :float AS dead_percent , last_vacuum , last_autovacuum , autovacuum_count FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE n_dead_tup < > 0 AND n_live_tup < > 0 ORDER BY relname ;
We also defined these two parameters to control how often we analyze the tables , autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.01 and autovacuum_analyze_threshold = 200 . They use the same logic as the ones used by autovacuum .
Parallel processing
PostgreSQL 9.6 has the possibility of running parallel queries under certain conditions . Some scans , joins and aggregation will be executed in parallel if this functionality is activated and if the database query planner decides it is a good plan . We wanted to activate this functionality but we did not have experience with it , so we were conservative when configuring this in our system .
At least these two parameters have to be defined to activate parallel processing :
max_parallel_workers_per_gather : In our case max_parallel_workers_per_gather=4 . We found out in the logs that the slow queries in our Zabbix infrastructure had at most 4 joins and we thought this was a good value to start with .
: In our case . We found out in the logs that the slow queries in our Zabbix infrastructure had at most 4 joins and we thought this was a good value to start with . max_worker_processes : In our case max_worker_processes=16 . This is 57 % of all the available cores in our system .
We defined also effective_io_concurrency = 4 to match the amount of parallel workers we can use in a query . There is very little information about this parameter when using SSD disks . The documentation says `` ... the best value might be in the hundreds ... '' , so we really do not know how this change impacts performance , we will have to investigate and test this further to get any conclusion .
Temp files
One of the problems we had in our old Zabbix database was the generation of large temporary files when running SQL statements . Most of these files were created because we did not have enough memory , controlled by the parameter work_mem , for sort operations and hash tables . In PostgreSQL , sort operations are used for ORDER BY , DISTINCT , and merge joins , and hash tables are used in hash joins , hash-based aggregation , and hash-based processing of IN subqueries .
The use of many and large temporary files was impacting the performance of our SQL queries so we activated logging of temporary files with the parameter log_temp_files = 0 to find out when we were generating these files . This gave us a lot of log lines of this type :
LOG : temporary file : path `` base/pgsql_tmp/pgsql_tmp16501.0 '' , size 147677184
Then we found out the biggest size logged for these temporary files , in our case around 140MB . What we did was to define the parameter work_mem = 150MB to have enough memory available for these sort operations and hash tables .
You have to be careful with this parameter because it will be used not per SQL query but per sort operation or hash table needed to return the query result . So you need enough memory in your system to cope with the value defined by this parameter . We calculated that in our system , with around 8 sort operation/hash table per SQL query , a maximum of 16 subprocesses in 4 parallel queries , and around a maximum of 20-30 active connections , we would use around 49GB in the worst case ( 150MB x ( ( 8 x 16 ) + ( 8 x ( 30-4 ) ) ) ) . That is around 9.5 % of our total memory ( 512GB ) , something we can live with to avoid the huge impact in performance when your system generates temporary files .
Other parameters
Other PostgreSQL parameters regarding performance that we changed are :
huge_pages = on
random_page_cost = 1.1
shared_buffers = 32GB
synchronous_commit = off
You can check the PostgreSQL documentation to get more information about them .
Conclusion
Right now and with this configuration we are processing between 2,000 and 3,000 Zabbix items per second and we are generating between 1,000 and 13,000 transactions per second in the database . The database is around 500GB , we have around 2 months of monitoring data and one year of alarms and events . The server is working perfectly and we have still a lot of resources available to grow .
If you are using Zabbix to monitor your IT infrastructure , you really have to take care of your database . PostgreSQL is an excellent database , stable and with a great performance but you have to configure it properly if you are processing large amounts of data . We can definitely recommend it as the database backend for your Zabbix installation .

Father Details Daughter 's Heroin Addiction In Obituary
MELISSA BLOCK , HOST :
The first thing you notice in the obituary for Molly Alice Parks is their photo . She 's young , bright red lipstick ; their hair streaked with pink and teal . Molly Parks died last Thursday in Manchester , N.H . They were 24 . And what 's most remarkable in that obituary is their family 's candor in revealing how they died - a heroin overdose . We reached Molly 's father , Tom Parks , at their home in Saco , Maine , today to talk about that decision to go public with their cause of death and their history of addiction . We began by talking about Molly 's passions - reading , playing the piano and drawing , especially gowns .
TOM PARKS : They played dress up their whole life . I mean , she 'd go to thrift shops and find nice dresses , get them for nothing and them and their friends would dress even if they stayed in the house . They never lost their passion for anything , though , believe it or not . I mean , you 'd think that addicts withdraw completely into themselves , and that was n't Molly . They loved their friends . They loved us . They loved life ; just the addiction was too much . They just - they could n't fight it off . And a friend of theirs told us that when they got out of the last rehab , when they were - the third one in eight months - that they are n't out for a week-and-a-half or so , two weeks , and their dealer was calling her , texting her , bugging her ; you know , I always thought they were a strong kid , but they are n't that strong .
BLOCK : When it came time to write the obituary for your daughter - for Molly - how did you decide to go public with the cause being a heroin overdose ?
PARKS : Well , I read papers . I 'm old school enough so that I still read paper-papers . And I 've seen a lot of obituaries , and you see 20-somethings , 30-somethings , 40-somethings and they all have sudden deaths , but that does n't really happen to 20 and 30 and 40-somethings . There 's no sudden death for them . It 's either suicide - and I understand people do n't want to put that or drug , you know , overdoses . And for the life of me I ca n't figure out why somebody would n't want to put that in an obituary because if you just keep sweeping it under the carpet , nobody is going to figure it out
BLOCK : The idea being that by being open about it , by being public about it , not sweeping it under the carpet as you put it , that it would help other people . It would help with this ...
PARKS : That 's what I was hoping . It would help somebody , somewhere . One person , that 's all we wanted , and that 's what we talked about . If it helps one person to see that somebody else died of the same thing then the answer - it 'll take care of things , you know what I mean ?
BLOCK : I 've been looking through your Facebook page , Mr . Parks , and was really struck by what you posted , I think , the morning after you found out that Molly had died . You said they tried to fight addiction in their own way and last night their fight came to an end in a bathroom of a restaurant with a needle of heroin . And I think this was the restaurant where they were working at the time .
PARKS : It was . It took me an hour to write that , and it 's not that long . But the reason that it was hard to write was 'cause I could n't see the screen or the keyboard 'cause I was crying so hard . After I had written it , I was kind of happy with the way it read 'cause I knew that it was the truth . I did n't want to be - I did n't want to hide behind a cloak of , you know , sudden-death . I wanted it to be transparent and blunt . People need to know there 's an epidemic . It 's rampant . People are getting a hold of heroin and they 're dying regularly .
BLOCK : As you saw Molly struggle over the years with addiction , in and out of rehab several times , another near fatal overdose before , did they talk to you about it ? I mean , what did you - what did you try to tell them to help them through this ?
PARKS : We tried everything . I mean , we tried being nice . We tried being mean . We tried withholding . We tried giving extra , you know what I mean ? It - when it 's your own child , you 're going to try anything you can to get them better . They knew that we knew , you know what I mean ? And they would n't come out and say oh , yeah , I 've been using all week . I mean - but if you asked them straight out , she 'd say , well , I 've been trying my best , and they knew they had an addiction . They knew they were struggling . And , you know , I do n't know if you know anybody or whatever , if you 've - anybody who has anybody that 's ever dealt with it , but it 's an addiction that has a pretty strong hold on people . I mean , you go from being a person that can live every day without it and then all of a sudden , you know , you need it .
BLOCK : Well , Mr . Parks , thank you so much for talking with us and for telling us about your daughter , Molly .
PARKS : Thank you very much .
BLOCK : That 's Tom Parks of the Saco , Maine . We were talking about their daughter , Molly Parks , who died last Thursday of a heroin overdose . They were 24 years old .

Is the Bitcoin Community Being Too Harsh on Gavin Andresen ?
Perhaps the biggest casualty of this week 's Satoshi Nakamoto/Craig Wright fiasco has been Gavin Andresen . But has the Bitcoin community been fair to one of its hardest workers ?
Also read : Ripple & Coinbase Expected to Obtain NY BitLicense
Once one of the bitcoin community 's most respected heroes , Andresen 's confirmation that they were “ convinced beyond a reasonable doubt ” that Wright was indeed Satoshi has resulted in a stream of mockery and often personal attacks .
For the public not familiar with cryptography or the technical details of how it should be used to show irrefutable proof , it was Andresen 's words ( even more than those of former Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director Jon Matonis ) that convinced them Wright was telling the truth .
Andresen had , after all , worked almost alone with Satoshi since 2010 , and it was Andresen who Satoshi personally chose to replace them as Bitcoin 's Lead Developer when they left the project abruptly in early 2011 .
They later admitted they had been possibly “ bamboozled ” by Wright 's claims and may have made a mistake in publishing their blog post before Wright 's , though they still seemed unsure either way :
It should be noted that Andresen has not formally retracted their statements and that Wright seemed able to reveal personal details about Andresen unknown to few others than Satoshi , eg : signing the message “ Gavin 's favorite number is eleven . CSW . ”
Andresen 's support for Wright 's claims were met with such skepticism that it led to their losing commit access to Bitcoin Core on GitHub ( ie : the ability to alter programming code of Bitcoin 's primary software protocol ) under the pretext that their online accounts may have been hacked .
Is This Really Fair ?
Some within the Bitcoin community have defended Andresen , including ShapeShift 's Erik Voorhees :
Bitcoin expert , Andreas Antonopoulos , also expressed their empathy , tweeting :
Avoid schadenfreude . Con artists can fool even the smartest people . What happened to Gavin and Jon could happen to anyone. # empathytime — Andreas ( @ aantonop ) May 5 , 2016
The first question that needs to be asked now is : whatever your opinion on Wright 's role in early development or Andresen 's personal judgment , did it affect Bitcoin at all ?
There was a ton of mainstream media attention . Some of it portrayed Bitcoin as a strange universe , but it has always done that . If anything , it served to remind the public that Bitcoin is still here , still growing , piquing further curiosity .
The bitcoin price barely shifted either on Wright 's initial “ proof ” or their ambiguous apology . Bitcoin companies continue building its infrastructure .
The second question is : Is Gavin Andresen somehow less of an expert on Bitcoin as a result ? They have worked on the project in some way or other since 2010 and is still one of its best-known figures .
They voluntarily stepped down as Bitcoin Core 's Lead Developer over two years ago , passing on the reins to Wladimir van der Laan . The identity of Satoshi , and whoever Gavin thinks that may be , do not affect how the technology works at all .
Nobody can deny the amount of time and effort Andresen has put into building Bitcoin from an almost-unknown experiment in 2010 to the multi-billion-dollar industry it has become .
Andresen has also arguably been one of Bitcoin 's best spokespeople , putting an amiable and charming face on a technology revolution the mainstream media loves to portray as dark , underground and risky .
The Gavin Andresen Story
It was Andresen who in October 2011 first floated the idea of a Bitcoin Foundation to lobby for cryptocurrency and promote the idea of a decentralized transaction network to a world that had never heard of such a concept .
Whatever became of the Bitcoin Foundation that eventuated from that proposal , it 's important to remember the response at the time was generally positive .
Born in Melbourne , Australia , Andresen emigrated to the USA at age five and grew up in Seattle , Anchorage , and California 's Santa Ynez Valley .
They gave away over 10,000 BTC ( current value $ 4.6 million ) via the Bitcoin Faucet . They have created nine BIPs ( proposed bitcoin protocol improvements ) , added 62,000 lines of code to Bitcoin Core , and removed 76,000 lines .
Andresen & Controversy
Andresen 's influence as Satoshi 's anointed Lead Developer has occasionally seen them involved in controversy even before this week 's events .
They stated on a podcast in 2012 that they had agreed to a CIA request to present on Bitcoin technology to its employees , which may have prompted Satoshi to disappear .
It has been Andresen 's support for rival protocol Bitcoin Classic , however , and its stated intention to hard-fork Bitcoin to allow ever-larger transaction block sizes , that perhaps left them vulnerable to more criticism after the past week .
Bitcoin has divided firmly into warring camps on the issue , amid claims larger blocks will lead to bandwidth problems , centralization , and leave it open to control by big business and other domineering entities .
Cutting the Tall Poppies
People seem to have an innate desire to see their heroes toppled , especially once individual opinions are put aside and mob mentality takes over . As Andresen themselves wrote :
We love to create heroes – but also seem to love hating them if they do n't live up to some unattainable ideal .
Although they were talking about Satoshi , Andresen unintentionally described their own position in the Bitcoin community . They did n't invent Bitcoin , or ask to become its public face . He 's a talented but ultimately ordinary man , an enthusiast , and geek who recognized Bitcoin 's potential before few others had and caught the hot potato when Satoshi tossed it .
Technology is ultimately made of people , people are inherently fallible , and few who have participated in the tech revolution have done so without a few slips along the way . To be a tech visionary is to invite controversy and criticism , as the world argues over what it should be and where it will lead us .
Was the Bitcoin community too harsh in its criticism of Gavin Andresen ? Does it make any difference to the project ? Share your thoughts below !

As for the phone number on the letters , 855-744-2360—I called it . The conversation was not enlightening . `` Thank you for calling the legal department , '' said a youngish-sounding man . `` This is Kevin , how can I help you ? '' I was calling about a letter I was holding from AllLed , I explained . Kevin asked for my letter 's `` file number , '' which was the one thing I could n't give him—it would have revealed the source from whom I had received the letter . I told Kevin I was a writer who had been given the letter by someone else . All I wanted to do was contact AllLed , LLC directly—so how could I do that ? `` We do n't have any information on the entities that send the letter , '' they said . It was just an answering service . `` We do n't have their contact information . '' `` Well , who are you the 'legal department ' for ? '' I asked . `` Hmmm , '' said Kevin . `` Legal department . '' `` I do n't get it—is 'Legal Department ' a real company ? '' I persisted . `` Hmmm , '' said Kevin again . `` We 're just Legal Department . '' `` Well , you work for someone , right ? What company do you work for ? '' `` This is Legal Department . That 's all we can say . ''
In the latest example of just how broken our patent system is , Joe Mullin has an excellent and detailed article unveiling one of the latest patent trolling scams : using some vague and highly questionable patents , combined with a series of shell companies , to send out tons of letters to small businesses , demanding approximately $ 1,000from any company that has a scanner connected to a network which has a `` scan to email '' function ( as most new scanners do ) . The story is bizarre and complex , but that 's part of the `` game '' that the trolls are playing to try to hide their trail.Go read the long version , but the more compact version is that it appears that patent trolls are learning from some of the `` innovations '' of today 's copyright trolling programs in which the focus is to broadly hit a ton of small possible `` licensees '' in the hopes that a reasonable percentage pays up . Traditionally , patent trolling mostly focused on larger companies with big bank accounts , thinking that most would rather just pay up than deal with the lawsuit . But this new generation is even more nefarious . The example in the article is a series of ridiculous patents originally granted to `` Laurence Klein , '' which lawyers are now claiming cover using a scanner that 's connected to the internet to email a scan . Here are the patents in question : The article talks about how a company called Project Paperless LLC started sending around threat letters about those patents , telling companies that they had to pay $ 1,000if they had a scanner that was networked and had such a feature -- which scanners from HP , Brother , Xerox and Canon all do . But , rather than go after those companies , the patent troll in this case claims that any company using one of their scanners is liable and has to pay these outrageous sums . One of the companies who received the notice , BlueWave Computing , led by Steven Vicinanza , decided this was ridiculous and fought back , following the Drew Curtis / Fark `` How to fight patent trolls '' plan to a tee : they pointed out they did n't infringe , made it very , very clear they would fight this to the end and that they were going to make it as painful as possible for the troll . While Paperless Post sued BlueWave , it quickly backed down and dropped the lawsuit two weeks later , leading BlueWave to issue a press release ( continuing with the Fark plan of publicizing the result ) .While all this was happening , there was also an ongoing effort by some unnamed people to expose Project Paperless ' effort and to show that the patents are n't valid.Among the things they discovered was that it appeared that some of the partners in the law firm that `` represented '' Project Paperless , likely had an ownership interest in the patents . Hill , Kertscher , and Wharton , LLP is the firm , and research suggested that partners Steven Hill and Scott Wharton had holding companies , Bonita Sunrise and Wexford Holdings , that at least partially owned the patents . Given that exposure , plus the success of BlueWave in fighting loudly , what happened next was only too predictable : Project Paperless wrapped up its various lawsuits and ... `` sold '' the patents to MPHJ Holdings , whose ownership is completely unclear . Soon after that , a whole series of companies popped up sending letters to companies demanding similar per-employee-payments for network-connected scanners . Among the companies Mullin uncovered doing this : AccNum , AllLed , AdzPro , CalNeb , ChaPac , FanPar , FasLan , FulNer , GosNel , and HunLos . Note a similarity in the style of all of those names ? Mullin includes a ( redacted ) threat letter from AllLed as an example . They also have the transcript of their phone call with the number listed on the letters ( it 's the same number on all the letters ) : As Mullin notes , this is n't a one-off case , either . There have been a growing number of similar attempts by patent trolls to go after large numbers of people or companies further down the supply chain , clearly following the traditional trolling strategy of just seeking lots of `` settlements '' from people who ca n't afford a lawsuit and do n't understand the specifics.No matter how you look at this , though , it 's yet another example of how the patent system is completely broken . It hearkens back to the 19th century when scam artists roamed the countryside hitting up farmers for `` licenses '' for `` patents '' on common farm equipment . At that time , they were called patent sharks , and Congress actually changed the rules on what could be patented to fix the problem . Of course , today Congress is n't known for actually fixing problems .

Self care is the most important thing you can do for yourself . We get so wrapped up in what we do on a daily basis that we tend to not stop and think about what we need for ourselves . I am one of those people who say I am going to do self care for myself , but put it on the back burner like most people and never get around to it . It has n't been until recently that I realized how important self care is and how determined I have become to do this for myself .
Everyone has different forms of self care ranging from reading a good book to skiing down the rough slopes in the mountains . It depends on the person and what makes them feel good and relaxed . The purpose of self care is to have fun and feel relaxed . We are so tense and stressed out in every day life that we need to slow down and realize that you only live once . Self care is n't hard to do its a matter of finding the time to do it in .
There are a ton of different things you can do out there , but here are a few that I think are easy , quick , and you can find time to squeeze them in anywhere .
Take a leisurely walk/stroll
Take a bubble bath
Read a book for an hour
Learn something new
Listen to your favorite song
Call someone
These are just a few quick things you can do during the day . None of them will take much of your time to do and it will give you a break from the every day stresses you encounter . When you take care of yourself you end up being a more productive person in the long run in your personal and professional life . Self care should be your number one priority because you should be our number one priority . You should always put your own needs first because you are who you have to rely on the most at the end of the day .
By providing self care to yourself you keep yourself healthy , happy , ready for the next thing , courageous , and bold . In our busy lives its hard at times to find self care time , but that 's why little things just like listening to your favorite song are important task for you to do . Yes of course taking longer self care time for yourself is also important , like vacation , but unfortunately you are not always able to do that so you need to take advantage of the time you have .
Some of the things I do for my self care is read , exercise , talk to my grandma , take vacations when I can , outdoor relaxation and more . It 's very important me to do these things when I am able in order to keep my mental health state positive as well as my own physical health . That 's another part I want to talk about is your own physical health . You need to make sure you are going to the doctor once a year to get your yearly physical to make sure that you have nothing that needs to be watched or taken care of . This is also a form of self care because if you do n't take care of your physical health the rest of your health can go down hill as well . Self care is an important part of your daily life so make sure to find come time even if its only ten minutes to include into your daily schedule . Trust me in the long run you will appreciate it and you will benefit from it on a daily basis .

The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a record high in 2011 , the United Nations ' World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) reported Tuesday ( Nov. 20 ) .
Chief among these heat-trapping gases is carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , the biggest culprit behind global warming . Carbon dioxide levels reached about 390.9 parts per million last year , which is 140 percent of the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million and nearly 2 parts per million higher than the 2010 carbon dioxide level , according to the WMO report .
The international body estimates that about 413 billion tons ( 375 billion metric tons ) of carbon have been released into the atmosphere since 1750 , primarily from fossil fuel combustion . About half of this atmospheric carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere , and much of it will linger for centuries , causing the planet to warm further , WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud warned .
Historically , the Earth 's oceans and forests have helped balance the atmosphere 's carbon equation by sucking up large amounts of the greenhouse gas . But Jarraud said natural carbon sinks might not be able to mitigate the problem as effectively in the future .
`` Until now , carbon sinks have absorbed nearly half of the carbon dioxide humans emitted in the atmosphere , but this will not necessarily continue in the future , '' Jarraud said in a statement . `` We have already seen that the oceans are becoming more acidic as a result of the carbon dioxide uptake , with potential repercussions for the underwater food chain and coral reefs . There are many additional interactions between greenhouse gases , Earth 's biosphere and oceans , and we need to boost our monitoring capability and scientific knowledge in order to better understand these . ''
Greenhouse cases trap heat within the Earth 's atmosphere and create a warming effect on the climate known as radiative forcing . From 1990 to 2011 , radiative forcing by greenhouse gases shot up 30 percent , with carbon dioxide blamed for about 80 percent of this increase , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
Besides carbon dioxide , methane ( CH4 ) and nitrous oxide ( N2O ) are also implicated in the greenhouse effect . In 2011 , the level of methane in the atmosphere reached a new high of about 1,813 parts per billion , or 259 percent of the pre-industrial level , due to increased emissions from human activities , such as cattle breeding , rice farming and fossil fuel use . The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide , meanwhile , hit about 324.2 parts per billion last year , or 120 percent of the pre-industrial level and 1 part per billion above the 2010 level .

One of the planet 's top dipsticks is in trouble .
The `` Keeling curve , '' the most famous measurement of the world 's rising levels of carbon dioxide for the past six decades , is in jeopardy from funding shortfalls .
The Keeling curve , run by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego , is the longest continuous record of carbon dioxide measurements on the planet . The measurements were begun in 1958 by Scripps climate scientist Charles David Keeling and are taken near the top of Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii .
Keeling died in 2005 , and their son , Ralph , is now the keeper of the `` curve . '' A physicist himself , they say the ongoing measurements at Mauna Loa are on the `` cutting edge of discovering what we 're doing to the planet . ''
Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is the greenhouse gas responsible for most of the warming attributable to such gases , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's ( NOAA ) Earth System Research Lab , which also measures carbon dioxide levels at Mauna Loa and other locations .
Increasing amounts of CO2 and other gases caused by the burning of the oil , gas and coal that power our world are enhancing the natural `` greenhouse effect , '' causing the planet to warm to levels that climate scientists say ca n't be linked to natural forces .
Carbon dioxide levels were around 280 `` parts per million '' ( ppm ) before the Industrial Revolution , when humans first began releasing large amounts into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels . They 're now near 400 ppm .
`` The programs have been supported over the years almost entirely through a bundle of federal grants , typically each lasting three years or so , with several grants running at one time , '' Keeling said on the Scripps blog . Calling the process `` haphazard , '' they added that the past year was especially difficult because several grants expired .
A recent crowdsourcing appeal has brought in some money , they said , but more will be needed to keep the $ 1 million per year project going . Increased awareness of the funding issues , brought about by the crowdsourcing request , has spurred new funding opportunities from private sources .
`` The situation is still very uncertain , but more hopeful , '' Keeling said . `` Still , we do n't know yet how these are going to turn out , and the immediate funding situation is still very urgent . ''
All of this comes against the backdrop of last week 's CO2 rise above 400 ppm at Mauna Loa for the second straight year . ( CO2 levels peak in the spring when plants come alive , then decrease when the plants die in the autumn . )
Keeling says that within the next two to three years , the measurement will stay above 400 ppm permanently . `` It 's just a matter of time before it stays over 400 forever , '' they said . Consistent levels above 400 ppm have n't been seen in human history and perhaps as long as millions of years .
`` We are living in extraordinary times , '' Keeling said .

See What Can Be Bought With The Child Support Money . Take A look ...
This is the best possible decision ever made . Take a look ...
# 3 Child Support
Child support system or child maintenance is completely allotted to a parent for the well being of their child . All the the child related expenses like school , food etc are taken care of .
But lately , there are numerous cases that highlight the misuse of the child support money in a very bad way .
# 2 The Misuse
Right from using the money to fulfill your partying ways to pay for your beauty , numerous funny uses of child support money had emerged in the past .
To prevent this , the state of Delaware developed the concept of Child support card . It clearly mentions what can and can not be done with this money .
Keep reading ahead to see the things that can be done and can not be done with this money !
# 1 The Uses
Tasha Brown was one of the first persons affected by this change . They were unable to buy a bottle of Hennessy from a local liquor store . They believe that money belongs to them and they should decide what they will buy with that money .
So according to this card , a parent can not purchase anything that can not be directly used by their child . Alcohol , cigarettes etc to name a few . You can use the money for your child 's education , clothing need etc .
If the program is successful in the states of Delaware , the government might apply it nationwide thus controlling its usage . This is such a healthy development by the government .

What 's Popular Now :
Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin has an unwanted 'honour ' from their loan spell in the Bundesliga .
Unfortunately not every loan spell can turn out as successful as Arsenal youngster Joel Campbell 's .
The Costa Rican ended their season as a Greek champion , and increased their global reputation with a Champions League wondergoal against Manchester United .
A Gunner who can not say they have had anywhere near the same level of success , is French midfielder Francis Coquelin .
Coquelin was a fringe player at The Emirates last season , who ended up getting frustrated with their lack of regular game time , and asked to go out on loan .
It appears to have been a backwards step for them in their career , or at best , a season wasted .
Their destination was Bundesliga club Freiburg , who finished fifth a year ago , but this season has been a struggle and seen them dragged into a relegation scrap .
Freiburg , seen at Arsenal as a defensive midfielder , has made just one start in the middle all season .
The rest of the time they have been shunted onto the right wing or left wing , but even that has not been all that much - they have made just nine Bundesliga starts all season .
In fact in 2014 it 's been disastrous . All of their appearances have been as a substitute , playing a combined 69 minutes since January 1 , with their last game in early March .
All of that considered , it should not come as any real surprise that Coquelin finds themselves named in German magazine SportBILD as one of the 15 'Flops ' of the Bundesliga season .
The list , billed as the 'ranking of horror ' by the magazine , is not put together on a whim ; it 's based on a statistical average of player ratings across the entire season , and picks out the 15 'worst players in Germany ' .
Coquelin will surely simply be glad their time abroad is coming to an end . While a negative experience , it will at least have been a lesson in how tough it is outside of Arsenal . Being played out of position , it hardly seems surprising the youngster has failed to shine .
If the 23-year-old has learned one thing , it should be that they need to knuckle down at Arsenal and not let what could be their last chance at The Emirates go to waste .
On Friday , Aug. 6 , a mathematician at HP Labs named Vinay Deolalikar sent an e-mail to a host of other researchers with a 103-page attachment that purported to answer the most important outstanding question in computer science . That question is whether P = NP , and answering it will earn you $ 1 million from the Clay Mathematics Institute .
Last fall , MIT News published a fairly detailed explanation of what P = NP means . But roughly speaking , P is a set of relatively easy problems , NP is a set of incredibly hard problems , and if they 're equal , then a large number of computer science problems that seem to be incredibly hard are actually relatively easy . Problems in NP include the factoring of large numbers , the selection of an optimal route for a traveling salesperson , and the so-called 3-SAT problem , in which you must find values that satisfy triplets of logical conditions . For instance , is it possible to contrive an attendance list for a party that satisfies the triplet ( Alice OR Bob AND Carol ) AND ( David AND Ernie AND NOT Alice ) ? ( Yes : Bob , Carol , David , and Ernie were there , but Alice was n't . ) Interestingly , the related 2-SAT problem — which instead uses pairs of conditions , like ( Alice OR Ernie ) — is in the set of easy problems , P , as is the closely related XOR-SAT problem .
Most computer scientists believe that P does n't equal NP , and that 's what Deolalikar claimed to have proved . But by the following Monday , despite being on vacation in the Mediterranean and having time only to glance through the proof , MIT Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Scott Aaronson had announced on their blog that they would mortgage their house and chip in another $ 200,000 if Deolalikar 's proof was correct . Last week , Aaronson took a few minutes to answer three questions about P and NP .
Q . Has the proof now been shown conclusively to be wrong ?
A. I would say yeah . It was clear a couple days ago that there was a very serious gap in the statistical-physics part of the argument . It was not clear at all that the argument for showing why an NP-complete problem like 3-SAT was hard would n't also show that problems like XOR-SAT are hard . Now , XOR-SAT is a variant of this satisfiability problem , which is known to be in P , which has an efficient solution . So if you 're proving that a problem is hard , but your proof could also be adapted to show that an easy problem is hard , then your proof must be fallacious : it proves too much . That 's the first check that people look for when someone announces a proof of P not equal to NP . Why does n't it also work for the easy problems ?
The problem with saying that the thing has been conclusively refuted is that whenever anyone points to a problem like this , Vinay Deolalikar has been tending to respond , “ Oh , yeah , sure , well , I 'm going to address that in my next draft. ” So it 's kind of a moving target . But I think it 's absolutely clear right now that at least the existing version does not solve the problem and furthermore would n't solve the problem without some very , very major new ideas .
Q . Why were you so certain that there was a flaw in the proof ?
A. P vs. NP is an absolutely enormous problem , and one way of seeing that is that there are already vastly , vastly easier questions that would be implied by P not equal to NP but that we already do n't know how to answer . So basically , if someone is claiming to prove P not equal to NP , then they 're sort of jumping 20 or 30 nontrivial steps beyond what we know today . So the first thing you look for is , What about steps one , two , and three ? Can they explain even the easier questions , how he 's answering those ? So I looked at the manuscript , and I did n't see that .
The other check is the one that I already mentioned , which is , Why does the proof fail for variants of NP-complete problems which are known to be easy ? What Deolalikar was doing is , he 's trying to argue that 3-SAT is hard by looking at its statistical properties . The problem is that 2-SAT and XOR-SAT , the problems that are easy , have very , very similar statistical properties , so it did not look like something that could distinguish the hard problems from the easy ones .
We have very strong reasons to believe that these problems can not be solved without major — enormous — advances in human knowledge . So you look at the paper and you do n't see that it 's commensurate with the scale of the problem that it 's claiming to solve . This is not a problem that 's going to be solved by just combining or pushing around the ideas that we already have .
Q . Given that most people are pretty confident that P does not equal NP , what would the proof really do for us ?
A . Yes , almost all of us believe already that P is not equal to NP . But this is one of those things where it 's not so much the destination as the journey . It 's the massive amount of new understanding of computation that 's going to be needed to prove such a statement . What are we trying to prove ? That for solving all these natural optimization problems , or these search problems , or a proof of a theorem , finding the best schedule for airlines , breaking cryptographic codes — all these different things , that there 's no algorithm , no matter how clever , that 's going to solve them feasibly . So in order to prove such a thing , a prerequisite to it is to understand the space of all possible efficient algorithms . That is an unbelievably tall order . So the expectation is that on the way to proving such a thing , we 're going to learn an enormous amount about efficient algorithms , beyond what we already know , and very , very likely discover new algorithms that will likely have applications that we ca n't even foresee right now .
Often in the history of theoretical computer science , the same ideas that you use to prove that something 's impossible can then be turned around to show that something else is possible , and vice versa . The simplest example of that is in cryptography , where you show some problem is hard to solve , and that gives you a code that is useful . But there are many other examples .
A few days ago the independent film `` The Inner Room '' ended up on BitTorrent . Where some filmmakers would see such an event as a threat , for producer Mark Diestler it 's quite the opposite . For months they had waited for pirates to pick the movie up , and now it 's out he 's seeing the film gain additional exposure . For the first time their movie has jumped into the top 250 as listed by IMDb 's movie meter .
Movie industry lobbyists such as the MPAA frequently claim that piracy is not only hurting the major studios , but also the smaller independent productions .
However , according to independant filmmaker Mark Diestler , it 's not that black and white . Last week their film “ The Inner Room ” ended up online , and as is so often the case thousands of people started to share the movie on BitTorrent .
Within 24 hours 5,000 people had already grabbed a copy without paying . For some filmmakers this is a nightmare scenario , but Diestler clearly disagrees as they see all these BitTorrent downloads as a good way to gain exposure for the film that took blood , sweat and tears to make .
“ I would much rather have 500,000 downloads than 5,000 , although our distributor may feel differently . The worst thing that can happen to a small film , any film for that matter , is to fall into obscurity . 500,000 people could download it and hate it , but in my mind that is better than then not seeing or hearing about it all , ” Diestler tells TorrentFreak .
“ In the end not everyone is going to hate it , some will like it and you would hope that a lot of people would enjoy it – and even more importantly talk about it . That buzz would hopefully translate to additional sales of the film . People buy the DVD to see the bonus features or just to help support the filmmakers of a film that they really enjoyed . ”
The filmmaker explains that unlike the big Hollywood productions , most of the independent films that get made have a negligible advertising budget . For these films , BitTorrent ‘ piracy ' serves as promotion . Diestler has witnessed the power of BitTorrent first hand when a friend 's film blew up thanks to piracy two years ago .
“ When you are a small film with zero money for advertising , BitTorrent can get your film out there and get people talking about it – that is all advertising really does anyway . It 's certainly an interesting question . Being friends with Jamin and Kiowa Winans – the filmmakers behind the film ‘ Ink ' – I am very close to this topic , ” they say .
When the “ The Inner Room ” was released the people behind the movie even toyed with the idea of pirating the film themselves to gain exposure . But eventually they decided to leave that up to the pros .
“ I remember the topic coming up with a few people involved in the film a couple of months before the release of our film on DVD if we should consider ‘ leaking ' the film to bit torrent . My first response was even I wanted to , I would n't know how . Even more importantly , do it properly . I would have to hire someone to do it ! How lame is that ? ”
“ In the end , we figured it would show up on BitTorrent regardless , so no need to post it ourselves . It took a couple of months , but sure enough , it finally showed up . Now we just have to hope to gain steam and people watch the film , enjoy it , and talk about it , ” Diestler concludes .
Thus far The Inner Room has done “ great ” on BitTorrent resulting in the much anticipated buzz . Just a few days after it was pirated the movie saw a huge bump on IMDb 's movie meter where it 's currently ranked 250 . And although the exposure is nowhere near that of “ Ink , ” the makers are content with the publicity BitTorrent pirates have given them thus far .
Update : Mark Diestler asked us to include the following statement .
First off , we have decided to add high quality legal downloads on our website . For the first time anywhere , the film can be downloaded in HD . $ 9.99 for the HD download , $ 7.99 for the SD . These are not region specific , so anyone from around the world should be able to download the film . Additionally , there is a donate button for those that would like to support our efforts .
I also feel it should be made clear that :
# 1 – I do not own the North American digital rights to the film , with the exception of selling downloads off my website .
# 2 – I 'm not condoning “ piracy ” – I am simply proposing that bitTorrent can give added exposure for a micro-budget film such as ours . Even if 10k people download it , that 's about 9,900 more people than would have normally seen/heard about it . So we miss out on 100 potential “ sales/rentals ” ? Even then , those are only potential sales , who knows how many actual sales… 5 ? I think the exposure of 10k views is probably far more valuable . But maybe I 'm completely wrong ?
# 3 – for those that do bitTorrent the film , if they hate it , they can be happy they did n't spend any money on the film . While others who enjoyed it may like to help out the filmmakers by making a donation or downloading a copy off our website or buying a dvd or simply talking about the film
Thanks for the support , Mark Diestler , Producer
For a significant number of potential 2016 voters , immigration policies are not an abstraction but have a direct impact for their loved ones .
As many as 1.5 million U. S. citizen relatives of immigrants awaiting deportation relief under the president 's stalled executive action program will be eligible to vote for president next year , a new study reports , and their votes could have an impact in battleground states .
By 2020 , that number will increase to 2.25 million , as more children and family members reach voting age .
The Center for American Progress , a progressive think thank , found that 6.3 million U.S. citizens live in the same households as relatives who would qualify for protection from deportation and work permits under Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents , or DAPA .
DAPA is a program authorized by President Barack Obama to temporarily shield millions of immigrants here illegally from deportation and allow them to work . To be eligible for DAPA the immigrants must be parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents . A lawsuit filed by the state of Texas and joined by other states has stalled the relief .
Manuel Pastor , one of the authors of the report , said these U.S. citizens of or reaching voting age likely have strong and personal connections to their DAPA-eligible relatives . Therefore , they said , they may be “ highly motivated ” to learn about the candidates ' positions on the DAPA program .
“ I think when people think about DAPA , they think about the effects on the parents themselves—the undocumented immigrants—and what they forget is that those folks are embedded in families , ” Pastor said . “ It 's important to remember that whatever affects undocumented folks actually touches people who are citizens and can vote . ”
The vast majority of U.S. citizens living with relatives who would qualify for DAPA are Latino , 82 percent . Asian American and Pacific Islanders follow at 8 percent .
Pastor said that as in past elections , these two groups of voters likely will view immigration as a “ threshold issue ” that determines whether or not they perceive a candidate is on their side .
A powerful Congressional committee delivered a strong rebuke to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday , rejecting their request to delete a provision that protects state medical marijuana laws from federal interference .
With a voice vote , the Senate Appropriations Committee added the rider to legislation funding the Department of Justice for Fiscal Year 2018 . The policy has been in effect in every annual spending bill enacted since late 2014 .
Earlier this year , as first reported by MassRoots , Sessions , a former senator , sent a letter pleading with their old colleagues in Congressional leadership not to continue the policy into next year .
“ I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict the discretion of the Department to fund particular prosecutions , particularly in the midst of an historic drug epidemic and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime , ” they wrote . “ The Department must be in a position to use all laws available to combat the transnational drug organizations and dangerous drug traffickers who threaten American lives… I respectfully request that you oppose the inclusion of such language in Department appropriations . ”
But senators rejected the request .
The successful amendment was sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D-VT ) .
“ It is more humane to regulate medical marijuana than to criminalize it , ” Leahy said during a brief discussion before the vote . “ I do n't want them spending money pursuing medical marijuana patients who are following state law… We have more important things for the Justice Department to do than tracking down doctors or others , epileptics , who are using medical marijuana legally in their state . ”
While the provision has been approved on the House floor with large bipartisan majorities , most recently with a vote of 242 to 186 in 2015 , it is unknown if that chamber 's leadership will allow it to be considered this year .
The Republican-controlled House Rules Committee has begun locking down the amendment process and not allowing votes on some riders it deems controversial . This week , for example , the panel blocked floor consideration of a proposal to allow military veterans to receive medical cannabis recommendations from U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doctors , a proposal which was approved by the House last year .
But even without a House vote , advocates have a good chance of getting the Senate-approved state medical cannabis protections included in final enacted legislation that will be drafted by a conference committee charged with merging the two chambers ' proposals into a single bill .
The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved the veterans medical cannabis provision earlier this month by a vote of 24 to 7 .
In the letter to Congressional leadership , Sessions wrote that marijuana use has “ significant negative health effects , ” arguing that is “ linked to an increased risk of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis , respiratory ailments such as lung infections , cognitive impairments such as IQ loss , and substance use disorder and addiction . ”
The vote , a stinging loss on an issue Sessions cares deeply about , comes as their position in the Trump administration is in question amidst an increasingly public spat with the president over issues related to the investigation on Russia 's attempts to interfere with the 2016 election .
Also on Thursday , the Senate panel adopted an amendment to protect state industrial hemp programs from federal interference .
Congress ' halls are n't hallowed for memorials Crowding prompts ban on all items
WASHINGTON -- A standoff is developing in the halls of Congress -- but not over such pressing issues as the war in Iraq or health care policy . Instead , the fight is over exactly what can be placed inside those congressional corridors .
House leaders are trying to clean up the hallways , which have long been littered with cast-off computer equipment and discarded furniture , and are cracking down with a new policy that bans almost any freestanding item from the corridors of the House office buildings .
Caught in the cleanup : easel-mounted displays honoring soldiers who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan , guest books on podiums outside office doors and even the occasional welcome mat .
Rep. Jim McDermott , D-Wash. , and dozens of other lawmakers have been issued citations and warned that the displays and furniture outside their offices violate the new policy . House Office Buildings Superintendent Frank Tiscione and the House 's chief administrative officer , Daniel Beard , warned the lawmakers that they have until Aug. 2 to comply -- or else the offending items could be removed .
McDermott is fighting back .
The Vietnam-era veteran says their three easel-mounted posters , which memorialize 99 dead servicemen and -women from the Seattle area , deserve to stay on display outside their office .
`` Having had that experience , if someone died from my neighborhood ... I want to ( honor that ) , '' McDermott said . `` I do n't want people to forget '' the casualties of the war , McDermott added .
The issue has united an unlikely foursome in Congress , bringing the liberal McDermott together with conservative Rep. Ted Poe , R-Texas , as well as Reps. Walter Jones , R-N.C. , and Steve Cohen , D-Tenn .
Like McDermott , the other three have hallway memorials honoring fallen soldiers .
They are pressing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , to relax the rule and make an exception for memorials honoring fallen soldiers .
Poe said they are going to `` respectfully refuse to comply '' with the edict and will not take down a poster with photos and names of 26 men and women from southeast Texas who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan .
`` Our poster is n't going anywhere , '' Poe said , before issuing a challenge to House management during a floor speech : `` Come and take it if you dare . ''
Jones said their `` Faces of the Fallen '' memorial should not be lumped together with hallway trash .
It makes sense for congressional leaders to try and clean out some clutter , including `` trash , recycle bins and old office furniture , '' Jones said . But , they said , it 's going too far to remove `` memorials to service members who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan . ''
The new policy went into effect April 17 after approval from Pelosi , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , and House Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio . They sit on the commission that oversees much of the Capitol complex .
The new clean-up rule was designed to make it easier for staffers and tourists to flee the building in case of an evacuation and make it easier for people using wheelchairs to navigate congressional corridors .
The halls in the three House office buildings have grown increasingly cluttered in recent years . Staff workers in crowded offices had become used to putting unwanted furniture , cardboard boxes and discarded equipment in the hallways for janitorial staff to remove -- eventually .
A walk down a marble hallway could take visitors by abandoned desks resting on their sides , long-disconnected monitors and cardboard boxes filled with reams of paper .
Lawmakers also have increasingly used the area outside their main office doors to display posters and draw attention to issues . For instance , members of the Blue Dog coalition of fiscally conservative Democrats had put signs near their doorways spotlighting the national debt .
In a July 21 letter to Jones , Pelosi defended the new rule , saying it was `` intended to facilitate evacuation of the buildings in the event of an emergency , to bring the House office buildings into compliance with safety and disability access codes and to provide consistent application of signage and posting rules . ''
Pelosi said they shared the foursome 's `` commitment to our fallen soldiers and ... those currently serving in uniform , '' but they held firm . `` Members may erect memorials or displays within their offices , but not in hallways where they present hazards to the disabled , visitors and congressional staff , '' they said .
An informal survey of House office buildings reveals that more than a dozen lawmakers still had memorials to fallen soldiers on hallway display as of July 24 .
McDermott said their signs do n't get in the way . `` I do n't see us making an obstruction , '' McDermott said .
But the Washington Democrat conceded they would be willing to put their posters in a wall-mounted display in the hallway , if House leaders signed off on that alternative .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — More than 2,000 conservatives in tuxedos and gowns recently filled Union Station 's main hall for a steak dinner and the chance to cheer the man who saved the Supreme Court from liberal control .
Justice Neil Gorsuch did n't disappoint them , just as they have n't in their first seven months on the Supreme Court .
“ Tonight I can report that a person can be both a publicly committed originalist and textualist and be confirmed to the Supreme Court , ” Gorsuch said to sustained applause from members of the Federalist Society , using terms by which conservatives often seek to distinguish themselves from more liberal judges .
The 50-year-old justice has been almost exactly what conservatives hoped for and liberals dreaded when they joined the court in April . They have consistently , even aggressively , lined up with the court 's most conservative justices . They have even split with Chief Justice John Roberts , viewed by some as insufficiently conservative because of their two opinions upholding President Barack Obama 's health law .
During arguments , Gorsuch has asked repeatedly about the original understanding of parts of the Constitution and laws , and they have raised questions about some long-standing court precedents , including the civil rights landmark ruling on “ one person , one vote .
Liberals ' despair about Gorsuch goes beyond their judicial actions . They occupy a seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia which they thought Obama would get to fill . But Senate Republicans refused to consider Obama 's nominee , a strategy that paid off when Donald Trump unexpectedly won the White House .
At the Federalist Society , Gorsuch recognized the improbable turn of events that led them from an appellate judgeship in their native Colorado to America 's highest court .
If someone had told Gorsuch a year ago what would soon transpire , “ I would have said that you had taken way too much advantage of my home state 's generous drug laws , ” they said .
Gorsuch likes to remind audiences of their relative youth , despite their head of silver hair , suggesting a long tenure on the bench . In front of a nonpartisan audience last month , they talked about their teenage daughters and the regular , early morning 17-mile bike rides along the C & O canal that they do with a friend .
They spoke fondly of the horses , goats , chickens and rabbits on the small farm where their family lived outside Boulder , Colorado , before moving to the Washington area this year . They enthusiastically recounted ski outings and their favorite moguls .
Early reviews of Gorsuch 's time on the court have varied with the ideological bent of their reviewers .
While their confirmation was pending , the liberal Alliance for Justice worried that Gorsuch would often embrace the most conservative outcome on the high court .
“ Our concerns were confirmed , ” said Nan Aron , the group 's president .
Daniel Epps , a Washington University law professor in St. Louis and onetime law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy , said they find Gorsuch 's style sometimes grating , less so the substance of their questions at arguments .
During a high-profile argument about politics in redistricting in October , Gorsuch began a question by suggesting that “ maybe we can just for a second talk about the arcane matter , the Constitution . ”
To Epps , the tone was all wrong , especially for the new guy on the nine-member court . “ I 'd love to see a bit more recognition that the court deals with really hard questions that many people , including their colleagues , have struggled with for a long time . If someone thinks they have all the answers , maybe he 's missing something important , ” Epps said .
Some of Gorsuch 's choices of where to speak — with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , at the Trump International Hotel and at the Federalist Society dinner — also have fed perceptions that rubbed their critics the wrong way .
The dinner , Aron said , “ was just the latest stop on Neil Gorsuch 's thank you tour to honor the people who got them what should have been Merrick Garland 's job. ” Garland , an appeals court judge , the Obama nominee whom the Senate blocked .
“ I think they could have done a better job certainly in the public appearances they choose to make to sort of send the signal that he 's not a Republican justice , he 's a justice , ” said Epps , who also co-hosts the Supreme Court-focused First Mondays podcast .
Their co-host , Ian Samuel , said there has been “ a hysterical overreaction ” to Gorsuch 's questions in the courtroom . Samuel , a professor at Harvard Law School and former Scalia law clerk , said Gorsuch has an obvious interest in questions about accountability in the American system of government and control over the court system . “ It 's better that they put it out there and says this is who I am . I do n't think they care whether some people think it 's shocking , ” Samuel said .
Leonard Leo , the Federalist Society executive vice president who has advised Trump on judicial picks , also took issue with Gorsuch 's critics when they introduced the justice at the dinner . “ They mischaracterize candor and a demand for rigorous analysis as polarizing , ” Leo said .
Gorsuch and Leo embraced on the podium , in front of an adoring crowd of like-minded lawyers , judges and academics . The Federalist Society , which counted Scalia among its earliest backers , has helped Trump identify candidates for federal judgeships and has members in legal jobs across their administration .
Gorsuch made no apologies either for the substance of their questions and writing , or their style . They talked at length about the importance of seeking out the meaning of the Constitution and laws as they were understood when they have written .
“ Originalism has regained its place at the table of constitutional interpretation , and textualism in the reading of statutes has triumphed . And neither one is going anywhere on my watch , ” Gorsuch said .
They went on to note that “ some pundits have expressed bewilderment ” about the questions they ask in court .
“ But while I have you here tonight , I thought I might just settle the matter once and for all by taking a poll . ... Should I just keep on asking about the text and original meaning of the Constitution ? ” they asked .
The response was predictably and overwhelmingly in favor .

Ever-inventive Moyes finding new ways to win as injury crisis increases at Goodison
Everton manager David Moyes admits they are having to become more creative in order to find ways to keep their side winning going into the second half of the season .
Injuries to key players - with midfielder Darron Gibson ruled out for a month with a thigh strain and forward Kevin Mirallas sidelined for a second time with a hamstring injury - have taken their toll over the festive period .
In Sunday 's home defeat to Chelsea , Moyes was forced to pick 18-year-old reserve-team defender Tyias Browning among their substitutes as their options were so limited .
Worthy of applause : Everton bucked their usual trend and started the season in fifth gear
Things have improved slightly with the return from suspension of Marouane Fellaini and the possibility of Phil Neville being fit again after being rested having complained of pain in the knee they had an operation on recently .
But Moyes ' management skills are being tested to the full once again and they accept they may sometimes have to tinker with their tactics .
'The mood is fine , we are healthy enough - I 'd like a few more players back from injury but so would a few clubs , ' they said .
'It is a busy time and I would n't say it is a time of year when managers and players want game after game .
'We 've had them ( Gibson and Mirallas ) out before . Kevin and Darron are important players for us but that is what happens .
'It is a test to try to find teams that can win without your best players . You have to find solutions . '
Sorely missed : Gibson had proved to be one of Everton 's most effective players since moving from United
One of the changes which looked like paying off against Chelsea was moving Steven Pienaar into a central position behind striker Nikica Jelavic from where they scored in only the second minute .
The South Africa international is usually a permanent fixture on the left , where they have a great relationship with defender Leighton Baines , but in Fellaini 's absence Moyes wanted to change things around somewhat .
' I do n't think their biggest thing is scoring goals but we 've needed to get some goals from different places and he 's managed to get some in recent games which have been important for us , ' said Moyes about Pienaar .
' I do n't want it to become predictable about Pienaar and Baines down the left and I felt it was right we changed it and I think they can do a job for us there .
'We will look to change it around when we can but we know we have a good thing going with what Baines and Pienaar do so we have to make sure teams do n't clamp onto it too often and we can cause them problems in other ways . '
Moyes is also hoping the new year brings a change of fortune for Jelavic .
The Croatia international arrived from Rangers on transfer deadline day last January and proceeded to enjoy a blistering start to their Everton career with 11 goals in 16 games in the second half of the season .
This campaign has been more patchy with just six goals in 20 appearances but Moyes is confident the striker 's form will return .
'He has continually worked hard . I think probably the difference from this time last year is that everything we made Niki scored , ' said the Toffees boss , who takes their side to Newcastle tomorrow .
'This time we are finding it just a little bit harder to get the ball in the net , which was evident against Chelsea .
'You hope the players continue the form they have shown in the past and a bit of confidence can make a difference , especially to forward players .
The unemployment rate for African-Americans fell to a 17-year low in September , and the rates for all other major racial and ethnic groups also dropped .
The jobless rate for people in their prime working years — defined as ages 25 through 54 — fell to 3.6 percent , the lowest level since June 2007 , a few months before the Great Recession began . And for Americans with only a high school diploma , unemployment fell to a 10-year low of 4.3 percent .
Continue Reading Below
All told , the unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent in September , from 4.4 percent in August . Employers shed 33,000 jobs , a decline driven by the damage inflicted on Texas and Florida by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma . Economists expect hiring should rebound in the coming months .
The data for demographic groups came from a survey of households that is part of the Labor Department 's monthly jobs report .
Panasonic has risen to the top position as a battery cell supplier for the auto industry through its partnership with Tesla , which has become the largest battery consumer in the world .
Now Toyota is courting the company for a battery partnership as the major Japanese automaker is playing catch up in the EV space .
The two Japanese companies announced today a deal to “ begin studying the feasibility of a joint automotive prismatic battery business . ”
They described the agreement in a press release today :
“ This agreement between the two companies aims to help find solutions to pressing societal issues such as global warming , air pollution , the depletion of natural resources and energy security . Furthermore , this agreement is intended to address growing demand and expectations for electrified vehicles . In order to realize these objectives , Toyota and Panasonic target further advancements in automotive batteries , which are crucial technologies in electrified vehicles . ”
Toyota has been entrenched in the development of hydrogen fuel cell powertrains and never focused on battery-electric vehicles .
Until recently , their biggest effort in the space was a partnership and investment in Tesla that led to the California-based automaker developing the all-electric powertrain for the Toyota Rav4 EV , which has since been discontinued as the Japanese automaker sold all its Tesla shares .
Now , Toyota plans to build its first all-electric vehicle from the ground up and it is expected to come to market in 2020 – making the company late to market compared to the rest of the industry .
Electrek 's Take
This is an important news because we can tell which automaker is most serious about the mass production of electric vehicles by looking at which ones are seriously working to secure battery supply .
Tesla was an early player in this game with its partnership with Panasonic and later its Gigafactory plan . Since then , other companies , like Daimler and Volkswagen have also launched important efforts to secure strong battery supply chains .
Now it looks like Toyota is going to add itself to the list .
Interestingly , they are exploring a partnership for “ prismatic ” battery cells . Panasonic 's main automotive battery products have been cylindrical cells since Tesla pioneered the use of those cells in electric vehicles . We have since seen several startups launching EVs with the same concept of using thousands of smaller cylindrical cells in battery packs , but established automakers have mostly been reluctant to use the technology and instead focus on fewer but bigger prismatic cells .
It 's why Panasonic 's production has been focused on cylindrical cells , but it also recently announced expansions of its production capacity across all its plants , including those that produce prismatic cells .
“ The Walking Dead ” season 7 episode 10 is a few hours away and it promises to be a good one . Episode 9 was n't as heavy on the heart as previous instalments as it showed that Rick is somehow regaining their old form . Their smile upon meeting a new community – the junkyard group – during the final scene was definitely the cherry on top of a nice midseason return , but according to an apparent episode 10 leaks , Rick will have nothing to smile about in the next instalment .
Spoiler alert : This preview contains plot details about “ The Walking Dead ” season 7 . The season premiered Oct. 20 . The series is available for Australian viewers to watch on Foxtel every Monday , 1:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m .
The reason behind Rick 's smile during the last episode is obvious . He 's happy to see a large group of people who they think can fight alongside him . After all , they need all the help they can get to fight off Negan .
Unfortunately for Rick , the leader of the junkyard group , Jadis , turns down their offer . Not surprisingly , that 's when Father Gabriel steps in and saves Rick and company 's behinds . They even help the Alexandrians gain leverage over the junkyard people when a fight ensues between the two squads .
Father Gabriel also reportedly convinces Jadis to at at least hear what Rick has to say and give them a chance to prove himself . Jadis ultimately gives Rick fifteen minutes of their attention , among others . Rick is put to the ultimate test when they are forced to fight the helmet-wearing spiked walker named Winslow who also previously appeared on the “ Walking Dead ” season 7 episode 10 previews . ( See the trailer below . )
It remains to be seen if Rick does convince Jadis and their group to join them against Negan and the Saviours . According to TV Geek Talk , the junkyard crew is a tight-knit bunch that has been staying at the same site since the start of the outbreak . It 's also quite ironic that Rick is asking the help of a community whose leader 's motto is “ We take , we do n't bother . ”
Richard , meanwhile , as they have previously shown , is all in against Negan . Ezekiel 's right hand man is out for Saviour blood , even at the expense of innocent lives . They initially convince Daryl to join them for some Saviour hunting , and handing them a brand-new crossbow . But Daryl eventually decides they want no part of Richard when they realise the latter 's planned blame game in case The Kingdom finds out about the attacks .
“ The Walking Dead ” season 7 episode 10 has an extended runtime of 66 minutes . Daryl is set to have an emotional reunion with Carol near the end of the episode before electing to forego The Kingdom and move forward on their own .

‘ The Walking Dead ' season 7 spoilers : What to expect
Ted Cruz wants , above all else , to be president . He 's spent years working and strategically plotting toward achieving that goal . After endorsing Donald Trump today , Cruz 's chances of becoming president have , it seems to me , nearly evaporated .
I 'd heard rumblings last week that Cruz , who had shocked most observers by refusing to endorse Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention in July , was wavering on the subject . So the news that broke today was therefore not entirely unexpected , but it does have a certain surreal quality . This is a disastrously bad decision on Cruz 's part , and one that they will come to regret . They fully deserve the criticism and scorn being heaped on them today and the realization they will have—albeit only now that it 's too late—is that this was not a mistake they could afford to make .
Since Cruz made their announcement on a Friday afternoon when I was busy preparing for the panel that I 'm moderating tomorrow morning at the Texas Tribune Festival ( “ The Future of Conservatism “ ) , I 'll just briefly explain the two latter points .
First , both of the reasons Cruz gave for their decision , in a statement they posted on Facebook Friday afternoon—that they signed a pledge and that Hillary Clinton is unacceptable—are demonstrably ridiculous . Even if you agree that Clinton is more “ unacceptable ” than Trump , and that a pledge made to the Republican National Committee should take precedence over one 's oath of office and one 's repeated promises to work for the 27 million people of Texas , it remains the case that Cruz signed the pledge last year and could have known , months ago , that Clinton would be the Democratic nominee . If those are their real reasons for endorsing Trump , in other words , they would have done so at the Republican National Convention , in July . In fact , they would have done so in May , at the Republican Party of Texas convention instead of refusing to do so in our interview .
Their answer effectively precluded them from endorsing either Clinton or Trump ; I noted that at the time , and they did n't disagree . Beyond that , multiple sources close to Cruz confirmed to me , last week , that they were considering an endorsement . Every single one of them cited external pressure . There was some disagreement about the source of the pressure , but none of them had changed their minds about Trump , and none of them suggested that Cruz had done so . In other words , Cruz 's assessment of Trump 's merits relative to Clinton 's has n't changed ; what 's changed is their assessment of the relative risks of refusing to endorse Trump .
That being the case , it should be easy to see why this is a mistake Cruz ca n't afford to make . To be clear , that 's an analytical comment , not a normative one . I would guess that their endorsement of Trump is an example of Cruz Rule Five ( “ he 's too smart for their own good ” ) , and—for what it 's worth—I 'm not entirely unsympathetic to him . I remember , from our conversation in May , how genuinely distressed they seemed at the realization that Trump would be the Republican nominee . I believe they were sincerely convinced that a Trump presidency would put the country , and the Constitution , in real peril . And I suspect that Cruz , in the privacy of the voting booth , may not tick the box for Trump in November .
At the same time , I 'm aware that even before today 's news , it was tricky to persuade anyone to consider giving Cruz the benefit of the doubt about anything—and after today , it will be impossible . Either their endorsement is a pack of lies , or their speech at the RNC was : they ca n't both be true . And though it 's possible that “ Lyin ' Ted ” might still one day become president , the odds , in my view , are now vanishingly narrow . We 've all heard it a million times : “ Everyone hates Ted Cruz. ” And now he 's given this faceless “ everyone ” plenty of reason to do so .
In America , you have to do a lot to fall into a bad position in the public eye . Hell , Britney Spears shaved their head and basically lost their mind in public , and now that they have a new wig and a new tour to go with it , all is forgiven . Apparently shame does n't wash off so easily in Japan , as NTV Presenter Miku Natsume has announced they will be resigning from their job because of a photo ( see gallery ) where they were seen holding a box of condoms .
Apparently the photo , which ran in weekly magazine Flash , caused quite a stir as it seemed to implicate that Natsume was not only having sex , but enjoying it . THE HORROR ! Japan Probe reports that they begged for a second chance , but their image had suffered with the housewives who made up a large part of the show 's viewership .
Hang on a second here : SMAP 's Tsuyoshi Kusanagi gets arrested for wandering around naked and drunk and it blows over , but this young lady commits the atrocious crime of insinuating they enjoy sex and loses their job for it ? I mean , we know Japan is sexist and all , but one ca n't help but harrumph at the unfairness of it all .

FUNNY WOMEN # 113 : BUDDHIST NUN PEMA CHÖDRÖN REWRITES THE CLASSICS
Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad
I 've certainly had better boat trips . I do n't deny there was a certain strangeness to seeing an ivory-trading middle manager succumb to frenzied rituals put on by a tribe who seemed too attached to costumes , masks , and screaming ( but I do n't judge them ) , and that I was n't unsettled , ultimately , to see people 's heads impaled on sticks with their scalps sliced open and straw stuck into the gray matter to emulate death rays . I ca n't say this was pleasant , but life is n't always pleasant . It 's just what is . Just as Kurtz let go of the conventions and restrictions of Belgian society , so must I let go of expectations of river trips . Kurtz , I would say , forgot to pay attention to their breath , and they got a little out of balance , but this happens , we 're all human , and sometimes we 're being skinned alive by screaming cannibals . The world keeps turning .
Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë
Why am I so attached to the idea that I have a twin soul and their name is Heathcliff ? There 's nothing wrong with Edgar Linton . He 's a perfectly fine fellow and even a little bit handsome if looked at from one angle . Heathcliff , it 's true , has a rugged profile and a dark , smoldering allure , plus I understand every atom of them with a love that surpasses understanding , but those feelings can just be looked at , accepted , and let go . There will be other feelings . What 's so special about those feelings ?
Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy
“ At last I see everything clearly , ” Anna said to herself , watching train tracks roll beneath their feet . “ Vronsky does n't love me anymore , but since we all exist in a state of wholeness with each other , their desertion should n't bother me . All love is self-love . And yes , I 'm shunned by Moscow society , but I need to let go of my need for outside validation . Everything we need is within . It 's hard that my husband wo n't let me see my son . Yes , that is hard . Things seem a bit bleak right now , but I can still get enjoyment from crossword puzzles and other simple diversions . I 'll go to the dining car for some tea . It 's cold out here . ”
The Unnameable by Samuel Beckett
I ca n't go on . Well , I can , but I choose to let negative thoughts dominate me . They keep me from awakening my compassionate heart and embracing loving-kindness . It would be more positive to impartially observe my negative thoughts , apply a joyful state of mind , and then let all my thoughts go . I might begin this passage : “ I can go on . Yes , I 'll go on with confidence. ” Better .
Silas Marner by George Eliot
That little golden-haired girl has done wonders for my crabbed , joyless existence . But if they roam away to another town and decides to stay with another miser , then that 's the way it goes . They can restore their faith in humanity , and I 'll go back to meditating on all that provokes resentment . Life is change .
The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway
“ Our nada , who art in nada ” suggests by its bitter , sarcastic tone that there once was something other than “ nada ” to pray to . But the duality of self and object , self and other , is an illusion . To be accurate , we should just say “ Nada. ” Or “ Nada nada nada , hare hare hare ” would have a nice ring . In any case , it 's negative and ultimately meaningless to address , even sarcastically , a hole that a deity once supposedly filled .
Moby-Dick by Herman Melville
If we get him , we get him . If we do n't , we do n't . There are probably other white whales out there . We can hunt them ! In any case , attachment to one goal is unbalanced . Process is more important than results . Also , inner wholeness . I 've seen the white whale go by more than once , but I have n't said anything . Ahab would thank me if they fully grasped the importance of letting go .
Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert
I 've never been so bored in my life . . . yet everything I need is right here , in this small , stultifying village , while I wait for my dull , thick-headed husband to get home . “ Need ” is a false construct anyway—we only “ are. ” I feel restless sometimes , but why do I believe things would be different anywhere else ? Let me focus on my breath . Why should life be interesting ? Even “ life ” is a false idea . Let me accept that . Null . . . trancelike . . . nothingness . Is this what they mean by enlightenment ?

President Donald Trump shakes hands with James Comey , then–director of the FBI , during an Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on January 22 , 2017 , in Washington , D.C. Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images
When Donald Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday evening , it sent off shock waves of concern that the president was seeking to protect themselves and their associates from the FBI 's investigation into possible connections between Trump 's campaign and the Russian government . The news — and President Trump 's Wednesday morning Oval Office appearance beside Henry Kissinger — triggered abundant references to President Nixon 's Saturday Night Massacre and questions of whether Comey 's dismissal has precipitated a constitutional crisis . Democratic legislators like John Conyers and Keith Ellison , as well as ACLU national legal director and Georgetown Law professor David Cole , have all answered that we are indeed now in a constitutional crisis . But most legal experts weighing in disagree .
Part of the challenge in answering the question is that there are several ways of defining a constitutional crisis , says David Pozen , a professor of constitutional law at Columbia University , who served as a clerk for both Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and Judge Merrick Garland , and as special assistant to Ted Kennedy on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
One definition , Pozen told the Voice , is “ officials refusing to comply with the Constitution . That is n't really implicated here — legally speaking , the president has the right to fire the FBI official . The breach is one of norms than of formal law . ”
Alternately , Pozen says , a constitutional crisis might be understood to be a situation in which the Constitution itself prevents the political system from dealing with major threats — but that 's not really accurate in this situation .
A third definition would be a situation in which there 's a loss of faith in the Constitution by the public or large segments of the public , Pozen says , but this definition is n't exactly applicable now either .
“ Comey 's dismissal may well be a political and democratic crisis , ” Pozen says , “ but it 's not a constitutional one . ”
“ If there 's a constitutional concern here , it 's at one remove , ” they say . As an independent actor , Comey might yet have uncovered constitutional issues : entanglement with a foreign power , emolument issues , other problems as yet unforeseen .
“ This looks like a preemptive strike against someone who might have wielded oversight , ” Pozen says , “ and in that sense we should be worried , constitutionally , that we will be less likely to get the production of constitutional accountability from this important office in the future . ”
Even so , political appointees in the executive branch are n't where anyone should be looking for constitutional checks on the presidency , Pozen says . The real constitutional checks on presidential power remain where they 've always been : in the judiciary and in Congress .
Senate Minority Leader and New York senator Chuck Schumer seems so far to be taking that responsibility seriously .
“ The dismissal of Director Comey establishes a very troubling pattern , ” Schumer told their peers on the Senate floor this morning . “ This administration has now removed several law enforcement officials in a position to conduct independent investigations of the president and their administration — from Acting Attorney General Sally Yates to Preet Bharara , and now Jim Comey . ”
The official explanation given by the White House , that Comey was fired for violating protocol in their public criticism of Hillary Clinton last year even as they exonerated them of unlawful activity , does n't hold water , Schumer said , given the timing of their dismissal , and it also raises serious questions :
Why was Attorney General Sessions , who had recused themselves from the Russia investigations , able to influence the firing of the man conducting the Russia investigation ? Did Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein act on their own or at the direction of their superiors or the White House ? Are reports that the president has been searching for a rationale to fire the FBI director for weeks true ? Was Director Comey 's investigation making significant progress in a direction that would cause political damage for the White House ? Why did n't the president wait for the inspector general 's investigation into Director Comey 's handling of the Clinton email investigation to conclude before making their decision to fire him ? Was this really about something else ?
The only acceptable solution , Schumer said , is for the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to continue Comey 's investigation into the Trump camp 's connections to Russia .
Schumer 's remarks came before the New York Times and the Washington Post broke the news this morning that Comey was fired shortly after requesting more funds to pursue their investigation into the Russian connections .
But Schumer and their party are in the minority in the Senate and the House of Representatives , and so far most Republicans have n't joined them in demanding a special prosecutor .
If the legislature is n't prepared to check executive power , we might have a real problem . The courts have so far served as a powerful bulwark against the Trump administration 's efforts to unconstitutionally restrict immigrant rights , but they 're not well equipped to investigate the question of whether the president and their associates unconstitutionally colluded with the Russian government . If Trump installs a loyal stooge at the FBI and Congress remains compliant , there might be no reliable way to identify or prevent constitutional abuses in the executive . And that , at the very least , might trigger the third sort of constitutional crisis Pozen outlines : a crisis of public confidence in the Constitution .
Alfonso Ribeiro has finally pulled out their signature dance move on Dancing with the Stars .
The actor wowed the audience with the jazz routine on Monday night 's ( October 6 ) show to Tom Jones 's 'It 's Not Unusual ' .
This week , viewers served as the fourth judge when compiling the scores , so the actor had been drumming up support on Twitter and encouraging fans to vote .

The jazz routine earned them a perfect score of 40 with their professional partner Witney Carson .
They previously contacted co-star Will Smith for permission to use their song 'Gettin ' Jiggy Wit It ' on the show .
Watch Ribeiro in action as Carlton Banks on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air below :
At R. James Woolsey 's farm in southern Maryland , solar panels on the roof of their house send electricity back to the utility grid when their family is not using much power . And they drive a Toyota Prius hybrid with a conversion kit that enables them to recharge the car 's battery pack using an extension cord and household current .
Woolsey is n't the average citizen who has gone green . As the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1993 to 1995 , Woolsey warns that the U.S. faces a grave national security threat from its dependence on energy derived from oil . “ I think we need to go right for oil 's jugular vein , ” they say .
The peril to national security arises from a variety of concerns , such as the vulnerability of the oil infrastructure and the consequences of funneling enormous sums of money to regimes unfriendly to the U.S . Although some experts focus on increasing the supply of domestic oil to lessen dependence on foreign sources , Woolsey believes that slashing demand for oil in transportation is the more promising approach .
Woolsey , a lawyer for the firm of Goodwin Procter , works with a number of groups involved in energy issues , including the National Commission on Energy Policy . Scientific American interviewed them in their Washington , D.C. , office .
In the interview , Woolsey made clear that merely lessening America 's dependence on foreign oil would not solve the national security problem .
“ It 's not just foreign oil . It 's oil . I think one thing that 's been wrong about the debate is that people assume everything would be fine if we just had more domestic oil and relied on foreign sources for a smaller share . I think that 's entirely wrong . In my view , since we 're not going to be the low-cost producer—the Middle East is—we 're going to end up with a jury-rigged structure of tariffs and subsidies that wo n't work . So I talk about independence from oil , not foreign oil .
“ That does n't mean that , if it 's affordable and ecologically sound , we should n't do some offshore drilling . I 'm not troubled by that . But our major effort ought to be to do to oil what refrigeration did to salt at the end of the 19th century—to destroy its monopoly . Once refrigeration did that to salt , it stopped mattering whether your country had salt mines . Countries did n't go to war over salt mines anymore . Salt was just a useful commodity , as it still is . We want to do that to oil . ”
Woolsey sees the threat to national security coming from many directions .
“ It 's the possibility of an oil cutoff such as the Saudis did in 1973 . It 's the possibility of terrorism against infrastructure in the Middle East , such as the attack on Abqaiq [ the oil refinery in Saudi Arabia ] two years ago . It 's the possibility of regime change , either violently or by succession . It 's if [ Saudi ] King Abdullah is succeeded by Prince Nayef , who is the interior minister , their half brother and one of the most powerful men in the kingdom . Prince Nayef is a fanatical Wahhabi . We might have a much more difficult time getting along with them than we do with King Abdullah .
“ It 's current regimes like the Iranian regime , fueled by high oil prices and developing nuclear weapons and threatening to wipe Israel off the map . It 's borrowing well over a billion dollars a day to import oil , which weakens the dollar and has all sorts of negative economic effects . Some of that finds its way through the Saudi government and wealthy individuals to the Wahhabi institutions of the world of Islam .
“ So when a Wahhabi madrassa in Pakistan is teaching little Pakistani boys the virtues of becoming a suicide bomber , you and I are paying for that through our gasoline purchases . ”
Woolsey worries about how vulnerable the nation 's energy infrastructure is to attack by terrorists .
“ I think it 's mainly the electricity grid and the fact that it 's so balkanized . Its management structure means that it 's very difficult to take the steps needed to improve security . It was put together by essentially 50 separate sets of engineers and regulators without a single thought being given to intentional interference . The substations are well designed to keep some crazy person from wandering in and electrocuting themselves but not well designed at all to deal with a terrorist or [ other ] intentional interference .
“ To use one example : four years ago when a tree branch fell in Cleveland during a storm , instead of just taking out part of Cleveland 's electricity ... it took 80 gigawatts off-line within nine seconds in the northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada . Terrorists are a lot smarter than tree branches .
“ I would also focus on the vulnerabilities of the trans-Alaska pipeline . People can put that thing out of operation with a rifle shot . ”
Reducing the national security risk , Woolsey argues , begins with the rapid adoption of plug-in hybrid vehicles that can get hundreds of miles to the gallon . These cars are recharged overnight by their owners , using a regular plug and wall outlet , and can go up to 40 miles between charges—farther than the average car is driven in a day . They rarely need to switch over to gasoline or to an alternative liquid fuel . A nation driving such automobiles would vastly decrease its need for oil .
“ There are two consequences to that . One , if you do n't drive much above average ... you may go for weeks and weeks without needing any more liquid fuel than you have in the tank . Your gasoline tank or ethanol tank is basically your insurance policy for long trips that you do n't normally take .
“ And two , since it is so efficient to drive on electricity , especially start-and-stop driving , you are doing the equivalent of charging your battery ... and then driving on what you 've paid for that , which in much of the country would be two cents or so per mile . Gasoline today would be 15 cents a mile , headed up . ”
Of course , more advanced battery technology for plug-in hybrids , and better alternative liquid fuels , would hasten a vastly diminished role for oil in transportation . Although it is long awaited , Woolsey is optimistic about such progress .
“ For about 150 years batteries essentially did n't change . Bright new graduates of Caltech and M.I.T . were n't starting battery companies . Now they are . What has happened is that laptops and cell phones and so forth have given a big boost to increasing energy storage because nobody wants to plug in those things all
the time .
“ What that has done to the opportunities for electric vehicles , including plug-ins , is quite remarkable . Electricity is easy—you need an extension cord . Alternative liquid fuels are a little harder because the cars have to be flexible-fuel vehicles ; one needs pumps for them and filling stations , but these are not deal killers . We made these kinds of changes getting lead out of gasoline . ”
The final step to getting the country off oil , Woolsey notes , is that regulators have to prompt the transition by providing incentives for saving energy .
“ If you change the rules so that people have an incentive to do what you want them to do , which is to save energy instead of waste it , they 'll respond . In California , utilities have done a very good job over the years of innovating . And a lot of that had to do with a public utility decision 20 years ago that said if you innovate and save energy and introduce new technology , we 'll give you a return on your investment , not on your sales . ”

With stabilizing sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean , climate forecasters announced Thursday that they have canceled the La Niña watch that had been in effect since April .
The diminished likelihood of a La Niña event starting this fall and lasting into the winter has ramifications far beyond the Pacific , including how the Atlantic hurricane season may evolve along with U.S. winter weather patterns .

Importantly , it also means there will not be a natural brake placed on the planet 's increasing fever , fed by human-caused global warming .

La Niña events , which are characterized by cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean , tend to lower global average surface temperatures .
The lack of a La Niña , or even just the presence of a weak La Niña as opposed to a strong one , means the current record-long string of the hottest months may continue through the end of 2016 and into next year .

El Niño and La Niña events tend to develop in the late spring and peak during the winter .
According to the latest forecast issued Wednesday by the Climate Prediction Center and the International Institute for Climate and Society ( IRI ) , there is just a 43 percent likelihood of a La Niña developing during August , September and October .
`` Overall , the combined ocean and atmosphere system continues to reflect ENSO-Neutral , '' the Climate Prediction Center stated in an update on Thursday .
Story continues
By November , December and January , the odds of a La Niña decrease to 39 percent , with a 57 percent probability of so-called `` ENSO-neutral '' conditions , meaning that there is neither an El Niño nor La Niña present . Some forecasters refer to this as `` La Nada . ''

In May , the forecast for August , September and October called for a 58 percent probability of La Niña conditions .
While sea surface temperatures ( SST ) in the tropical Pacific Ocean are near the threshold for a La Niña event , Emily Becker of the Climate Prediction Center wrote in a blog post that computer model forecasts show that ocean temperatures are likely to rebound and stay above the threshold .
`` The second step of the La Niña conditions decision process is 'do you think the SST will stay below the threshold for the next several overlapping seasons ? ' For now , the answer to this question is 'no , ' '' they wrote .
According to Becker , La Niña conditions have failed to develop because the ocean and atmosphere failed to interact in the necessary ways to fully develop such an event .
La Niña events tend to diminish the winds at high altitudes across the tropical Atlantic Ocean , which can aid the formation of tropical storms and hurricanes . Such storms tend to sputter and die when faced with powerful upper level winds , and the expectation of a weak La Niña helped lead to forecasts of an above average hurricane season .
Record warm months aided by El Niño conditions

Coming out of a record-strong El Niño event during 2015-2016 , the climate has smashed longstanding temperature records . July of this year , for example , was the warmest month since temperature records began in 1880 , according to the two U.S. agencies that track global temperatures : the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and NASA .
Scientists have said that while El Niño , which is characterized by above-average ocean temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and altered weather patterns worldwide , was responsible for only a minority of that record warmth .
Instead , human-caused global warming has been the biggest player in turning up the Earth 's thermostat .

If August turns out to have been the warmest such month on record , it would make it the 16th straight month to set such a milestone , which is unprecedented in NOAA 's climate history .
For climate scientists , what matters is the long-term trend over decades to centuries , making monthly records much less significant compared to the steady increase in temperatures throughout the 20th and 21st centuries . The long-term record shows an unmistakable upward trend in global temperatures , with warming accelerating in the oceans and atmosphere in recent decades .
For example , climate scientists have said that it is now virtually certain that 2016 will beat 2015 for the dubious distinction of the hottest year on record .
COMPANY TOWN Disney Studios drama might alter the industry
Chairman Rich Ross has begun restructuring operations and set in motion a plan that could pit the film unit against business partners .
In meetings with producers , filmmakers and agents , Ross attacked the industry custom of spending $ 40 million on a TV advertising blitz two weeks before a film 's opening , rather than enlisting more targeted campaigns that harness social networks and the broader Web . And he 's raised again the touchy subject advanced by Iger that consumers are demanding that movies become available for home viewing sooner after release in theaters than has traditionally been the case .
If it backfires , it could undermine what has historically been the creative heart of Disney .
Seeking to recast the studio for the digital era , Ross and Iger have set in motion a plan to dramatically challenge entrenched practices , potentially pitting Disney against theater owners , retailers and other business partners . The gambit , if it works , could be emulated by other studios .
In less than eight weeks , Rich Ross has swiftly stamped their imprimatur on Walt Disney Studios . The novice movie chairperson and their boss , Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Iger , want to create a new business model for Hollywood to address the sweeping changes that are roiling the entertainment industry , including slumping DVD sales and the growing role the Internet plays in movie marketing .
If you thought President Obama moved quickly , that 's nothing compared with the first 50 days of the Ross administration .
Hollywood might finally be absorbing the message .
`` Any of us that are sitting around protecting old business models unfortunately are destined to have a hard time succeeding in the coming years , '' said Sam Gores , chairperson of talent agency Paradigm . `` We have to maximize our existing models and , more importantly , build new ones . ''
It 's too soon to know whether Ross , a seasoned TV executive , can pull off their ambitious plan as well as successfully transition to the movie side of the business -- the track record in Hollywood is mixed . Ross declined to be interviewed .
In September , Iger stunned the industry when they ousted Disney 's movie Chairman Dick Cook , a 38-year veteran who began as a Monorail operator at Disneyland . By installing Ross , who built the Disney Channel into a global juggernaut , Iger gains more control over a key division they believed had long operated too independently .
Since Ross took over in early October , they have dismissed several top executives and begun restructuring operations . In the process , some say , the hyperkinetic executive displays flashes of brusqueness and impatience . The upheaval has created anxiety for employees and even at times disrupted business dealings . An important meeting with director Tim Burton and producer Joe Roth , who once ran Disney 's studio , to discuss marketing plans for the upcoming release of their film `` Alice in Wonderland , '' for example , was abruptly canceled pending an executive shake-up , leaving the filmmakers flummoxed .
Since then , Disney watchers have needed a score card to track all the comings and goings .
Last month , Ross flew to New York to fire Daniel Battsek , the head of Disney 's struggling specialty movie label , who , despite the unit 's recent poor track record , was caught off guard . A week later , they pushed out another company veteran , Mark Zoradi , who was president of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group , in a prelude to an overhaul of the marketing and distribution operations that they oversaw . Ross next let go marketing President Jim Gallagher and elevated former home video chief Bob Chapek to an expanded role that encompasses all aspects of film distribution from movie theaters to home and digital delivery , breaking with the conventional role of solely booking movies into theaters .
In the coming weeks , Ross plans to hire a new marketing chief -- Disney has retained an executive search firm to find candidates outside and inside the movie business -- who will have an equally broad mandate to handle the promotion of films from multiplexes to living rooms .
Beyond organizational changes , Ross ' vision for the types of movies that will ultimately define Disney is beginning to emerge . Their main focus will be developing family-friendly movies under the Disney label . Iger 's overarching strategy is to amass a stable of recognizable entertainment brands -- Pixar Animation Studios and the pending acquisition of Marvel Entertainment Inc. -- and exploit the films across its TV , theme parks , consumer products and game divisions .
DWANGO , the Dial Up Wide Area Network Games Operation ( originally Doom Wide-Area Network Game Organization ) , was an early fee-based multiplayer server for Doom , Doom II and Heretic . It was created in early 1994 by Bob Huntley and Kee Kimbrell in Houston , Texas . The first version was released with the shareware release of Heretic .
Since it predated widespread consumer access to the Internet , players had to dial long distance to Houston . Even so , it was wildly popular , and the creators reaped a healthy profit from the subscription fees . By early 1995 , ten thousand subscribers were paying $ 9.95 a month , some calling from as far as Italy and Australia .
About this time , Huntley and Kimbrell decided they should expand , and began setting up a franchising system . They charged a flat fee of $ 35,000 to set up a server , and would let the franchisee keep the rest of the profits . In four months , they set up 22 servers across the country .
With the advent of Quake came multiplayer across the Internet , and DWANGO , which had started to dwindle by late 1995 , was all but dead after its release . It was formally shut down in 1998 .
DWANGO 's legacy includes the semi-official DWANGO map packs created by various authors . Compiled into collections by Lance `` Aikman '' Lancaster , an employee of DWANGO 's hosting provider IVS , they are still used today by DM players .
The name DWANGO is likely a play on the name Django or Durango .

Masters of Doom by David Kushner
Jozy Altidore had two goals , while Michael Bradley added a goal and an assist . Landon Donovan came off the bench and score – of course they did – two minutes later , stealing the show on national TV . Sacha Kljestan , Benny Feilhaber and Ricardo Clark all picked up assists . DaMarcus Beasley played one of their best games of the year , and Tim Howard stood impossibly tall in net when they were called upon .
It was as if the US men 's national team , circa 2010 or so , decided to take center stage all at once . I 'll even go ahead and include Juan Agudelo ( he was that season 's teenaged `` flavor of the week '' talent for the fanbase ) in the mix , since they picked up another assist as the Revs picked up another win .
These are MVP candidates and Comeback Player of the Year candidates and Best XI candidates . They are the past , but they are all still the present and many of them will be the future as well . That is the narrative for this weekend , a story driven home by Donovan 's exclamation point of an equalizer ( see the video above for more on that ) .
With that said : Jordan Morris scored their 10th goal on Saturday , becoming just the second American rookie in the league 's history to hit double-digits . Jack Harrison , the No . 1 overall pick , grabbed two assists – and the second was to Khiry Shelton , who was 2015 's No . 2 overall pick . That year 's No . 1 overall pick , Cyle Larin , grabbed their 14th goal .
Diego Fagundez scrapped on both sides of the ball for New England , and Marlon Hairston started on the flank for Colorado . Alphonso Davies got 20 minutes and raised hell for Vancouver .
It is easy to slip into one narrative at the expense of the bigger picture . In this case the big picture paints a league of veterans grinding through the late-summer heat , but doing so side-by-side with younger teammates who are shouldering increasingly large responsibilities .
Marky Delgado and Alex Muyl went toe-to-toe , as did Matt Polster and Luciano Acosta as did Justen Glad and Mauro Manotas .
Some of the above guys ( Polster and Shelton were born seven months after Agudelo ) are n't that young , and some ( Davies ! ) are impossibly so . Players mature into their roles at different speeds , as has always been the case .
That said : These guys are every bit as much the present and the future as the guys in my lede paragraph . Enjoy them all because this was a hell of a weekend of MLS .
Let 's take a look around :
For Whom the Bell Tolls
Kelyn Rowe and Agudelo undressed the Montreal Impact by 3-1 at Stade Saputo on Saturday , largely silencing that bell the 1642MTL supporters group loves to ring .
It was savage from the Revs , who could 've won by three or four if the woodwork had been a little bit more kind to Agudelo . It was also very probably necessary in the wake of Tuesday 's 4-2 loss at Dallas in the US Open Cup final , since losing that particular game tends to take the wind out of any team 's sails ( Union fans , who remember the last two Octobers , are nodding right now ) . They needed the bounce-back and got it .
Jay Heaps tinkered once again , moving to something that looked like a 4-3-2-1 and thus getting Agudelo , Rowe , Fagundez , Lee Nguyen and Kei Kamara all onto the field together in roles where they could do damage .
I 'm not sure it mattered , though . New England probably could have lined up in a 6-3-1 because this is how Montreal defended :
And this is how and why the Impact have gone from one of the league 's best teams in the spring to a group that should maybe be a little bit worried about their playoff spot with autumn just hours away . Montreal is on 38 points , and the Revs are now on 36 . D.C. and Orlando City are on 34 , and only two of those four teams are going to make the dance .
I still think it 'll be the Impact – a four-point cushion goes a long way in a league where nearly a third of the games end in draws . But there 's no reason to be certain there 'll be a postseason in Montreal since this team allows opponents to just stroll up the field and hit passes like that .
It 's been a recurring probably for the last four months and is the other shoe that drops when a player like Didier Drogba is signed . Drogba scored yet again and he 's now got 10 goals and 5 assists in 1540 minutes , which is a DP-caliber return on investment . Their lack of defensive range , however , has made the Impact so easy to play through , and as a result they 've suffered defensively whenever he 's on the field .
Compounding the issue is that guys like Ignacio Piatti , Harry Shipp and Lucas Ontivero , all of whom started , are not the types to make up for someone else 's defensive shortcomings , and the over-30 defensive midfield duo of Hernan Bernardello and Marco Donadel do n't have the wheels to cover the giant gaps that appear because of it . And thus you get Scott Caldwell gliding into 40 yards of space before putting Kamara and Agudelo through .
Scarier , though , is the lack of cohesion in the team . No pressure on the ball , and the defense playing a high line , and one central defender going with the threat while the other drops ...
That 's madness . And I 'm not sure where it came from ( it 's not all right to blame all of this on Drogba 's unbalancing defensive effect ) because this is not the team Montreal were in the spring .
`` It keeps going , especially at home , '' head coach Mauro Biello said afterward . `` We can see the fragility of the team here . Obviously , getting scored on after only 30 seconds is not normal . It starts to play in your head . We did not execute defensively , we did not mark properly . ''
Indeed . They are 0-3-1 with a -8 goal differential in their last four home games and have basically given back the points with good recent road results at Toronto and at Philly . They have put themselves in a precarious position when the last three months should instead have been about fighting with TFC , NYCFC and the Red Bulls for the Eastern Conference title .
They 've had their horse shot out from under them at what should 've been a moment of triumph . Now it 's about survival .
Dateline : Toronto
The top six teams in the Supporters ' Shield race all drew this weekend , because this is MLS . For some – Dallas , who shook off their title hangover to get a point at NYCFC – the draw probably felt like a win . For others – Colorado , who could n't crack San Jose 's code – it almost certainly felt like a loss .
Who wants to guess what it felt like for Toronto ? The Reds came back from a two-goal home deficit to draw 3-3 against the visiting Red Bulls , a result that keeps them top of the East , but also significantly damages their Shield hopes . It was a game that reaffirmed Altidore 's bona fides as the hottest goalscorer in the league and arguably the best all-around forward , and it was a game that spoke to the depth the team 's built through good drafts and a great academy .
It was a result that hinged on a smart tactical move from Greg Vanney , who abandoned the 4-4-2 diamond early in the second half , sacrificing a central defender in order to move to a 3-5-2 with a pair of true wingbacks and thus forcing New York to defend touchline to touchline , subsequently reducing the effectiveness of the visitors ' high pressure .
Forget the goal . Look , instead , at the field position of the RBNY players when Delgado turns the ball over :
Eight of the nine visible Red Bulls are on the strong side . TFC tried repeatedly to shove the ball into that particular gap and paid for it in very real and measurable ways ... and then they did n't .
Putting wide players out there to get chalk on their boots was the right move from Vanney , and doing so opened up space for Bradley ( who , despite their box score stats , was n't particularly sharp ) to make this play :
A defense that 's moving around is a defense that 's in at least a little bit of trouble , and the 3-5-2 was invented as a way to destroy teams that clog central midfield . Switching to it was the right call .
`` The truth is they threw everything at us , went three in the back and had players out wide and tried to put us under pressure , '' Kljestan said afterward . `` And they did a good job of it . ''
Having Altidore go HAM obviously helped , as did a quietly stellar second-half performance from Alex Bono . TFC , even without Sebastian Giovinco , have answers .
New York have a lot of answers too , of course . I should have opened the segment with this tidbit : Bradley Wright-Phillips got their 19th and 20th goals today , and in so doing became the first player in league history to have multiple 20+ goal seasons . If Altidore 's the hottest forward in the league then BWP 's the most consistent . Kljestan , meanwhile , got their 16th assist , and became the first since Carlos Valderrama to have 30 or more assists across two seasons . Sean Davis had another strong game , as did Muyl , as did Daniel Royer .
But they 're left with the same questions now that they had last week , and three weeks ago , and five times in their last 10 games :
The Red Bulls have now settled for a draw after having a two-goal lead in the second half in 5 of their past 10 matches . # TORvNY — Thomas Floyd ( @ thomasfloyd10 ) September 18 , 2016
Bigger story from that one than the result : Frank Lampard came out before halftime with what looked very much like a left calf injury , which is the same calf that kept them out at the start of the season and plagued them in 2015 as well .
Patrick Vieira compensated by shifting Tommy McNamara into Lampard 's spot and putting Shelton in on the wing . If Lampard 's missing time over the next month , expect to see more of that look .
Can McNamara play that role ? I think so , since their game is – like Lampard 's – based upon the speed of their brain rather than the speed of their legs . Shelton , meanwhile , looks ready : Their output of 3g/6a in just under 1000 minutes compares favorably to any winger in the league on a per-90 basis .
Still , Lampard 's loss should n't be ignored . They 're 8-4-3 when they start this year , and 4-5-6 when they do n't . One of those is a playoff team , and the other is n't .
So the pressure 's on the kids . So far , at least , they 've lived up to it
Theresa May under pressure as DUP says : ‘ Show some respect '
Theresa May will press ahead with a Brexit-dominated Queen 's speech shorn of a series of controversial social policies after failing to complete “ confidence and supply ” negotiations with the Democratic Unionist party .
The Conservative leader will become the first prime minister in decades to lay out a legislative programme without a guaranteed House of Commons majority after DUP sources said the two-party negotiations “ have n't proceeded in the way we would have expected ” .
The Northern Irish party accused Downing Street negotiators of being chaotic and said the “ Conservative high command ought to stop their backbenchers whingeing about the DUP and show our party some respect ” . The DUP added that the party “ ca n't be taken for granted ” .
No 10 sought to brush off the intervention , with May promising on Tuesday that they would use the Queen 's speech to respond with “ humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent ” after the snap general election left the Tories with 318 seats , eight short of an overall majority .
Plans for a new generation of grammar schools will be among a number of high-profile policies to be dropped by the PM , in a speech which will instead emphasise Brexit , counterterrorism and the least controversial aspects of the domestic agenda . The speech is likely to steer clear of any mention of contentious issues such as gay marriage or abortion .
Ian Lavery , the chair of the Labour party , accused May of having “ no mandate , no authority and no programme ” to even win support in parliament for those areas of policy .
“ This is chaos from a weak and wobbly prime minister , ” they said . “ At the moment , it looks like the Tories are unable to put together even a basic programme for government in the Queen 's speech , or stitch together a stable deal with the DUP to stay in office . ”
Tory sources insisted the government was confident of winning support for its legislative agenda , with an agreement with the DUP still expected to be signed off on Thursday – well before next week 's crucial parliamentary vote on the Queen 's speech . Defeat for May in that vote would mean their government would fall .
May 's own backbenchers – including some of their most vociferous critics – also made clear that they would back the government at this point , although made no promises for continued support in the medium term .
In order to secure enough parliamentary backing , May will have to scrap plans to end free school meals for younger pupils , and drop their party 's social care policy , including means-testing of the winter fuel allowance alongside lifting the ban on selective schools .
They insisted , however , that they would be pushing ahead with Brexit legislation , including a “ great repeal bill – to bring EU regulations into UK law – and a series of other bills linked to customs , trade , immigration and agriculture .

“ Much has been said in recent days about what the general election signified about Britain 's decision to leave the EU , ” they said , responding to a clamour from some for a softer form of Brexit given the new parliamentary mathematics .
“ The fact is that over 80 % of the electorate backed the two major parties , both of whom campaigned on manifestos that said we should honour the democratic decision of the British people . ”
A cabinet minister said Jeremy Corbyn 's party was essentially in the same position as the Tories when it came to ending free movement and leaving the single market , despite a number of backbench Labour MPs questioning the position .
The shadow chancellor , John McDonnell , said Labour would seek to create alliances with Tory rebels and other parties to “ reverse some of the most dangerous cuts ” of austerity .
“ There 's a whole range of issues around austerity where we think there may well be majorities in parliament now to reverse some of the proposals , particularly those brought forward in the last budget , ” they told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
“ We 'll finalise the drafting of amendments over next the next few days . We 'll wait to see the Queen 's speech today . From all the reports it 's pretty light .
“ But remember , most of the austerity that 's rolling forwards is from the budget , and we wo n't see another budget until the autumn . ”
May said their government would be one that “ consults and listens ” as they struck a more conciliatory tone after the election seriously weakened their leadership and resulted in the loss of their two closest advisers , Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill .
“ The election result was not the one I hoped for , but this government will respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent , ” May said . “ We will work hard every day to gain the trust and confidence of the British people , making their priorities our priorities . ”
They will face a tense atmosphere on Wednesday , with protesters planning a “ Day of Rage ” march on parliament in protest at the government 's handling of the Grenfell Tower tragedy .
Organisers have written on Facebook that they hope to “ bring down the government ” and “ shut down London ” .
A difficult few weeks for May led to them facing crowds chanting “ coward ” after initially failing to meet people affected by the fire .
As well as the series of Brexit bills , May is expected to respond to recent attacks in Manchester , London Bridge , Westminster and Finsbury Park with beefed-up counter-terrorism plans , including a focus on social media .

There will also be some uncontroversial domestic moves including a civil liability bill to tackle a “ rampant compensation culture ” in which whiplash claims have spiked .
There will also be a financial guidance and claims bill to help consumers make effective decisions , and draft legislation on cracking down on domestic violence – particularly where children are involved – and pushing ahead with plans to ban letting fees for renters .
Sources said the Queen 's speech would also include a consultation on social care and a bill on mental health - but nothing on the NHS more widely .
In order to pass the legislation next week , May is almost certain to need the support of the 10 DUP MPs to give them a majority in the Commons .
Problems have emerged in the discussions between the Tories and the DUP , with unionist sources saying “ backbiting from Tory backbenchers ” against their party had stiffened their resolve to dig in .
They said complaints by Tory MPs about having to deal with the DUP had gone down badly . “ They attempted to bounce us into a deal on Saturday night and then we had the backbenchers saying that we were unsavoury , etc . ”
There is also a concern within the DUP that extra spending in Northern Ireland could trigger a barrage of complaints from English , Scottish and Welsh Tories over the special treatment .
The DUP wants to abolish air passenger duty for Northern Ireland 's airports – but there are concerns that a special deal could lead to demands for the same elsewhere in the UK .
The DUP deal is likely to be one of “ confidence ” , through which the party will back the Queen 's speech and support the government in any confidence votes , and “ supply ” , which refers to support for budgets and financial measures .
Hannah White , the director of research for the Institute for Government thinktank , explained how May would have to operate to survive the parliament .
Tory MPs urge loyalty after suggestion Theresa May has 10 days to improve Read more
“ Getting legislation through the Commons should be possible with effective whipping , ” they said .
“ While government and opposition numbers on public bill committees will be evenly balanced , procedural conventions around the way the chair votes when a committee vote is tied mean the Conservatives should be able to get bills through committees without any amendments .
“ Then , drawing on the support of the DUP or other parties , they may be able to make any amendments they need at the report stage . ”
May will , however , face fierce resistance to some of their Brexit legislation , with a parliament in which opponents of a hard Brexit feel emboldened by the general election result .
Frances O'Grady , the TUC general secretary , said : “ Theresa May failed to win a mandate at the ballot box for their no-deal Brexit . Instead , we need a Brexit deal that puts jobs and rights at work first . ”
They said the great repeal bill “ must not be allowed to get away with eroding the rights that working people got from the EU ” .
Other campaign groups , including Global Justice Now and Another Europe is Possible , claimed the legislation could result in a “ decimation of rights ” .
On April 19 , The Cato Institute vice president of research Brink Lindsey tweeted their dislike for former member of congress Ron Paul for their “ hideous corruption of libertarian ideas. ” Accusing the most important member of the Libertarian movement of spreading ideas that “ [ put ] their movement in the Trumpism family tree , ” the Cato scholar accused both the president and the former presidential candidate of being xenophobic .
Ron Paul 's xenophobia was a hideous corruption of libertarian ideas and puts their movement in the Trumpism family tree — Brink Lindsey ( @ lindsey_brink ) April 19 , 2017
But to Paul supporters who have been paying attention to the Texas obstetrician and their decades of anti-collectivist activism , the idea that one of the most peace-oriented free marketers in recent history is anything close to xenophobic did n't sit well .
Trending : Conservative Journalist Jacob Engels Suspended On Twitter For Calling Out Radical Islam
It was with that sentiment in mind that author Alex Witoslawski wrote a piece denouncing Lindsey and highlighting their “ long history of promoting views at odds with the grassroots libertarians. ” Daniel McAdams , executive director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity , pointed to an October 2002 Reason piece by Lindsey entitled “ No more 9/11s : The case for invading Iraq . ”
But as soon as Witoslawski 's article went live on April 21st , something went incredibly wrong as countless Facebook users reported being momentarily blocked from making certain posts once they shared Witoslawski 's piece on the social media network .
Some of those who agreed to speak to Big League Politics about this ordeal were clearly upset . Was Lindsey or those who felt sympathetic to their complaints behind a campaign to stifle Witoslawski 's right to have their voice heard by reporting their article ? Or was Facebook itself using its “ fake news ” witch hunt as a means to punish libertarian-leaning organizations ?
Some of the most prominent figures to have their accounts temporarily flagged included Jeff Deist , the president of the Mises Institute , an educational organization focused in researching and teaching the Austrian School of economics and laissez-faire political economy .
In their post , Deist criticized Lindsey 's impulse to “ impose a cultural component upon libertarianism. ” Deist added that by attacking Paul 's supporters , all the Cato scholar proved was that they seem unwilling to have the humility to put themselves in other people 's shoes .
Even the widely popular page Liberty Memes was temporarily flagged after sharing Witoslawski 's article .
In a conversation with Big League Politics , one of Liberty Memes ' administrators said that as soon as they noticed that particular link had been targeted , they “ immediately thought of the way our page was treated last year. ” They asked to remain anonymous .
In 2016 , Liberty Memes saw images mocking then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton being suddenly deleted from its page . As administrators were suspended from Facebook , they were left with no way to appeal the company 's decision but to go to the media .
“ Do n't get me wrong , ” one of the administrators explained , “ Facebook is a private company that has every right to treat its users any way that it wants. ” However , “ a vital market function is consumer feedback , and if [ Facebook ] wants to please its users , it will listen when they complain about having their views silenced . ”
Seeing Liberty Conservative as a publication that keeps “ libertarians and conservatives intellectually honest , ” the administrator added that it 's “ an absolute shame to see them silenced with the threat of punishment on users who share their material . ”
To Witoslawski , this issue must be cleared as soon as possible , as Facebook 's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has “ said they want Facebook to be treated as a public utility . ”
In a statement to Big League Politics , Witoslawski said that while Facebook has the right to censor what it sees fit , if that is the case , the company should refrain from spending “ more than a million dollars each month on lobbying for favoritism and special deals from the government. ” After all , if they are “ seeking to use the power of the state in order to monopolize the social media market , ” then they “ have no right to censor any news or opinion website based solely on its content , which is what Facebook is doing by blocking my latest article for the Liberty Conservative . ”
Calling this targeted campaign an “ out-of-control assault on our First Amendment rights , ” Witoslawski is concerned that leaving this issue unaddressed would lead to a “ purge ” of right-wing views from social media platforms .
Others who had their page temporarily flagged included authors who contribute to Liberty Conservative such as Rocco Lucente , Eduardo Rivero Puente , and Shane Trejo , all editors with the publication .
Big League Politics contacted Facebook 's conservative outreach team , providing them with links to pages that were punished for sharing Witoslawski 's story . While we have reason to believe they will get back to us soon with a statement or more information on why this particular link was targeted , we have yet to receive anything back .
This story will be updated .
Billionaire business person Donald Trump stumps in the Midwest as they lead the field of candidates in the Republican presidential race .
Billionaire business person Donald Trump stumps in the Midwest as they lead the field of candidates in the Republican presidential race .
— For five days , the royal-blue bus rumbled through miles of cornfields alongside a popular annual bicycle trek across Iowa . It showed up at a country music concert in Cherokee and at a bacon festival in Ottumwa .
And when the hulking vehicle with thick white block letters that spell “ TRUMP ” pulled into a Wal-Mart parking lot in Fort Dodge this week , people flocked to it . It did n't matter that Donald Trump was n't inside . The bus alone — with the “ Make America Great Again ! ” slogan extending across its sides — created an irresistible oasis of celebrity politics amid a desert of minivans and shopping carts .
“ One hundred people showing up for a staffer ? I 've never seen anything like it , ” said Chuck Laudner , a longtime Iowa organizer who oversees Trump 's efforts here . “ They kept saying the same thing : They want something different . ”
For many Americans , the Trump presidential campaign amounts to a billionaire talking endlessly , and entertainingly , on television . But here in Iowa , it 's another story . Trump is trying to beat the politicians on their turf , building one of the most extensive organizations in the Republican field .
The groundwork laid by Trump 's sizable Iowa staff , with 10 paid operatives and growing , is the clearest sign yet that the unconventional candidate is looking beyond their summer media surge and attempting to win February 's first-in-the-nation caucuses .
How could Donald Trump 's campaign possibly still be alive , given all of the impolitic things he 's said ? The Post 's Chris Cillizza has the answer . ( Tom LeGro/The Washington Post )
This is becoming a cause of concern for rival campaigns .
“ I see them as a major threat to all the other campaigns because of the aggressiveness of their ground game , ” said Sam Clovis , an Iowa conservative who leads former Texas governor Rick Perry 's campaign .
“ You can not swing a dead cat in Iowa and not hit a Trump person , ” Clovis continued . “ It 's unlike anything I 've ever seen . . . . Every event we go to — the Boone County Eisenhower Social , the Black Hawk County Lincoln ­Dinner , the boots-and-barbecue down in Denison — the Trump people are everywhere with literature and T-shirts and signing people up .
“ The Trump bus will pull into an empty parking lot and just be there on the main drag , like the little town of Le Mars , the ‘ Ice Cream Capital of the World . ' . . . People will pull over , go sign up . They 'll get 50 people in an hour and go to another town . That happens all over the state . ”
Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad ( R ) , in an interview Thursday , said of Trump : “ I think he 's got a real campaign here . Whether he 's willing to devote the time to go to as many places as some of the other candidates are going is the question . ”
Backers of former member of congress Ron Paul 's presidential campaigns , which were well organized in Iowa , see Trump appealing to Paul 's base here despite the competing candidacy of Paul 's son Rand , Kentucky 's junior U.S. senator .
“ He 's catching on with the average Americans who have had it with foreign wars , our trade policies and a stalled economy , ” said Drew Ivers , Ron Paul 's 2012 Iowa campaign chairperson .

Daniel Acker/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue .
Trump 's colorful assault on the political establishment and strident opposition to illegal immigration has propelled their candidacy to the lead here and nationally . A CNN-ORC poll on Wednesday showed them in first place in Iowa with 22 percent , followed by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson in second with 14 percent . Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker , who is counting on the caucuses , fell to third at 9 percent .
Trump will make a theatrical return to Iowa on Saturday . They plan to touch down in Des Moines by private helicopter , landing in a field just outside the Iowa State Fairgrounds , and then visit the famed butter cow , according to Republicans familiar with the campaign . They also plan to huddle with activists .
Candidates traditionally give a speech and take questions at the fair 's Des Moines Register Soapbox , but Trump is not planning to do so . They are in a feud with the Register ; after the newspaper 's editorial board called on them to withdraw , Trump slammed the newspaper and began barring its reporters from their events .
Other candidates are building solid networks here as well . Former Florida governor Jeb Bush , whose Iowa operation has nine paid staffers , announced campaign chairs in 22 of Iowa 's 99 counties on Wednesday , with more to come . Walker , who has four staffers and two consultants here , unveiled a 65-member Iowa leadership team last week that includes lawmakers , mayors , sheriffs , county treasurers and party stalwarts .
But Trump is taking a different approach . Their state director is Laudner , a highly regarded grass-roots tactician and confidant of Rep. Steve King ( R-Iowa ) , who is a powerful force on the hard right . This time four years ago , Laudner drove Rick Santorum around the state in their pickup truck , guiding the former senator from Pennsylvania to a come-from-behind victory in the 2012 caucuses .
“ I 've told people from the beginning : Never underestimate Donald Trump , ” said Bob Vander Plaats , president of the Family Leader , an influential social-conservative group here . “ He has been very successful for a reason . They know how to market , and specifically they know how to market himself , very well . They also understand what the customer wants . ”
It is an open question , how­ever , whether Trump 's singular brand of politics will stay in vogue until the February caucuses . And there are doubts that Trump can win enough votes from evangelical Christian conservatives , who are being courted heavily by Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Tex . ) , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and others .
Last month at the Family Leader 's candidate summit in Ames , Trump , a Presbyterian , caused unease when they said they had never asked God for forgiveness and spoke casually about Holy Communion .
“ When I drink my little wine — which is about the only wine I drink — and have my little cracker , I guess that is a form of asking for forgiveness , ” Trump said .
Iowa radio host Steve Deace said they would be “ very surprised ” if Trump won here . “ Whatever chance they had to get evangelicals to coalesce around them went out the window at the Family Leader , ” they said . “ Everyone was paying attention , especially those who are fed up with the Republican Party , but they did n't sell them . ”
Trump is trying to defy conventional wisdom about the caucuses by creating a broad coalition .
It has become a punch line among party insiders that Trump 's Iowa co-chair is Tana Goertz , a political neophyte best known for being a runner-up on Trump 's NBC show “ The Apprentice . ”
But others on the Trump team are experienced political hands . Co-chair Richard Thornton is a lawyer plugged into state legislative politics , and deputy state director Chris Hupke is a former head of the South Dakota Family Policy Council known for their field organizing . Another top aide is Ryan Keller , who ran congressional campaigns and the Republican Party in Polk County , Iowa 's largest .
Trump has made only occasional campaign stops in Iowa , and they eschew the small retail appearances that other candidates make .
Making up for their absence is the “ TRUMP ” -emblazoned bus . The campaign advertises on the Web when the bus will be in a town . Residents turn out to get Trump yard signs , Trump pins and Trump T-shirts . More important , they leave their names and contact information and take home kits explaining how to become caucus captains in their precincts , distribute bumper stickers and write letters to the editors of local papers .
Political organizing in Iowa requires sophistication because of the state 's unique system . Voters gather at a designated time with their neighbors and advocate for their preferred candidates before ballots are cast .
Turnout in Iowa caucuses is historically low . In 2012 , only 121,000 of the state 's roughly 600,000 registered Republican voters participated . In 2016 , strategists expect turnout to increase to 140,000 or higher .
The Trump campaign is targeting voters who may not have participated in a caucus before , modeling its strategy on Barack Obama 's 2008 Iowa campaign , which mobilized tens of thousands of new caucus-goers .
“ We 're reaching people that the Republican apparatus does n't even know exist , ” Laudner said . “ The other day , one woman came up to say , ‘ Hello , a lifelong Iowan . ' Them first question to us was ‘ What 's a caucus ? ' After we told her , they wanted to help . . . . Politics has not been the biggest thing in a lot of these people 's lives . They 've got lots of stuff going on with their jobs or families . But they feel Donald Trump is what this country needs . ”
Carson also is trying to use their political-outsider status to attract new voters into their camp . The challenge for both candidates will be getting people to show up on a cold night in February .
“ It 's these nontraditional candidates , Carson and Trump , who are going out there really trying to bring new people into the process , ” said Craig Robinson , editor-in-chief of the Iowa Republican . “ If motivated , sure these people will caucus . ”
On a Saturday in late July , Trump swept into Oskaloosa , a town of about 11,000 , where they addressed an overflow crowd at the local high school as their bus ­sat parked outside . Wearing a ­salmon-pink tie and dark suit , they gushed about the state .
“ Whoa ! Beautiful , beautiful , ” Trump said . “ It 's a terrific place , Iowa . Terrific ! We just got in , and I 'm driving through these beautiful fields . I want to grab that corn like you 've never seen . So rich , so beautiful . ”
Costa reported from Washington .
CHICAGO -- It 's easy to trash a writer for blowing their first baseball column of the season , but please do n't judge me too harshly .
Do n't get me wrong ; I 'm a professional . This column is a part of the process , part of the job , and I come to Wrigley Field to win . Every column is sacred .
But if you feel like you 've already wasted your time , it 's important to remember sportswriting is a parallel-front approach and progress is n't linear . Sometimes , it 's not even obvious .
The Cubs began a new era with a familiar result -- an Opening Day loss . Rob Grabowski/US Presswire
This is my Opening Day column . I still get a few butterflies . I 'm not alone . As Theo Epstein noted Thursday morning , `` Opening Day feels like a holiday , like a celebration . ''
Well , maybe before Opening Day ends in a loss . The Cubs lost 2-1 to the Washington Nationals on Thursday in pretty familiar fashion : no offense and a blown save . You might be disappointed in the loss , but the new Cubs Way preaches Opening Day is for amateurs . Theo 's Cubs have a proprietary formula that values other games more .
`` I really cherish the second day of the year , '' Epstein said . `` Because that 's when the baseball rhythms kick in . ''
Baseball is better with baseball rhythms .
I do n't care who wins or loses . I root for my column . With the loss went my paean to baseball .
Luckily , Matt Garza felt my pain . With reporters camped out at Kerry Wood 's locker -- they blew the save by walking three in the eighth -- Garza thought the media was taking it all too seriously .
`` Shhh , quiet , guys , I think someone died , '' they said from their locker . `` [ Bleep ] , guys , it 's Game 1 ! It 's like a [ bleeping ] morgue in here . ''
Then , they turned up the clubhouse stereo extra loud . Bob Marley to the rescue , every day and every night .
So I trudged back up to the press box to write . Bear with me today and the rest of April , and what the hell , maybe through Memorial Day . I might misspell some words or botch a few metaphors . I might call Ryan Dempster , who looked good in the opener , a Cy Young candidate . We 'll see how it goes . I do n't like to not write well , but I promise you things will get better .
The newly discovered vulnerability in using MD5 signatures for SSL certificates has many people wondering about the security of their web sites and the security of other sites they visit on the Internet . Essentially , the vulnerability could allow an attacker to get an SSL certificate from a certificate authority that signs its certificates with MD5 , and then engineer another certificate with completely different information in the certificate . In combination with other attacks ( such as a DNS vulnerability like the one that was recently discovered by Dan Kaminsky ) , an attacker could spoof any website on the Internet ( although sites with EV Certificates would be much more difficult if people are looking for the green bar ) .
Because of this , many people are avoiding sites that use an SSL certificate with an MD5 signature . The SSL Blacklist plugin for Firefox has even been updated to look for MD5 signatures . An article published by Netcraft reveals that about 14 % of SSL Certificates in use on the Internet use the vulnerable MD5 Algorithm :
Netcraft 's December 2008 SSL Survey found 135,000 valid third party certificates using MD5 signatures on public web sites , which is around 14 % of the total number of valid SSL certificates in use.The great majority consist of certificates from RapidSSL ( shown as Equifax on the certiifcate ) . As of Netcraft 's December survey , all of the 128,000 RapidSSL certificates in use on public sites were signed with MD5 ; there are some much smaller CAs that use MD5 still , and there are a small number of certificates from Thawte and VeriSign , although most of their certificates are signed with the more secure SHA1 . Other CAs use only SHA1 . Verisign ( owners of RapidSSL since 2006 ) have stated that they have stopped using MD5-signing for RapidSSL certificates , and will have phased out MD5-signing across all their certificate products by the end of January 2009 . Other affected CAs are likely to follow suit , as SHA1 is well established and is already in use for the majority of SSL certificate signing , so it should be simple to switch to using this more secure alternative . Once it is impossible to obtain new certificates signed with MD5 , this attack will be neutralised . The attack requires a collision between newly created certificates — one valid and one fake — deliberately created by the attacker . As such , there is no particular risk to existing SSL certificates signed with MD5 , and they do not need to be replaced . VeriSign are nevertheless offering free replacements for customers that want them ; and it is possible that browsers will start to distinguish certificates signed with MD5 so that users can exercise caution , as CERT have issued a vulnerability note suggesting that users could check for this manually .
Even though this vulnerability does n't directly affect sites with certificates that use MD5 signatures , it is recommended that you replace any certificates on your sites that use MD5 with certificates that use more secure algorithms ( such as SHA-1 ) . You can check whether a certificate on your site uses an MD5 signature by entering the site name where your SSL certificate is installed below . Our SSL Checker will display the signature algorithm of each certificate in the chain and warn you if one of them is using MD5 .

Guest Opinion : The Future of Los Angeles is Bus Rapid Transit
Los Angeles is finally on its way toward realizing the dream of a regional rapid transit system . Five rail lines are simultaneously under construction , and there is renewed momentum to fund another round of transit expansion on the 2016 ballot . Move L.A. recently unveiled a Strawman Proposal for “ Measure R2 ” to accelerate the completion of the remaining Measure R projects and offer a new vision for transit , highway , and complete streets improvements across Los Angeles County .
For Angelenos and transit nerds everywhere , there is a lot to get excited about . The centerpiece of Move LA 's vision is a $ 27 billion expansion of Los Angeles ' rail network ( right , and also mapped below ) . Other features of note include $ 9 billion toward a “ Grand Boulevards ” program for complete streets improvements on the region 's automobile-oriented thoroughfares , and $ 3.6 billion toward active transportation projects . Although Move LA 's vision is just an early draft , a measure along these lines could transform the region—on par with the development of the expansive freeway network half a century ago .
Nevertheless , there 's something missing .
Move LA 's Measure R2 proposal does not effectively articulate one of the most critical ingredients to reshaping mobility in Los Angeles County : a spectrum of bus improvements , including bus rapid transit ( BRT ) , to enhance transit service throughout the region .
Los Angeles already has many features of a great transit metropolis , but its greatest challenge is one of geometry : even after another $ 27 billion rail investment , only a handful of cities , neighborhoods , and corridors will have convenient rail access . For most Angelenos , including many in densely-populated , growing , or transit-dependent areas , buses will continue to serve as the only accessible mode of transit . Rather than rehashing bus vs. rail debates , Los Angeles must embrace upgrades to its bus system ( the nation 's second-busiest ) in tandem with rail expansion to reach a level of transit abundance that brings frequent , quality service to as many people as possible .
A spectrum of bus improvements are necessary . In many locations , bus stop upgrades to provide adequate shelters , security , and real-time arrival information may be sufficient when combined with frequent service . For other locations , BRT—dedicated lanes and more robust rail-like infrastructure—is necessary to provide quality service and room for growth . Yet , details on bus improvements in Move LA 's Measure R2 proposal are thin : the proportion of funds allocated to transit operations remains constant , and bus enhancements are mentioned only briefly under the Grand Boulevards program .
The lack of a comprehensive regional BRT vision in Move LA 's proposal is indicative of the region 's cautious approach to reallocating street space for buses and other users . While Metro has implemented two ( mostly ) off-street BRT lines—the Orange and Silver Lines—and an extensive Rapid network , the on-street implementation of BRT has been limited . A handful of “ peak ” hour bus lanes ( 7-9am and 4-7pm ) have been implemented on Wilshire , Sunset , and Figueroa , and similar treatments have been recommended on nine additional corridors in Metro 's Countywide Bus Rapid Transit and Street Design study . However , Metro has currently no plans for more comprehensive bus improvements , such as all-day dedicated bus lanes and rail-like stations .
The city of Los Angeles is effectively leading the charge for bus improvements and more advanced BRT features as it develops concepts for a Transit-Enhanced Network , but the city lacks funds to implement these improvements without its own citywide ballot measure . The city is also is tied to a problematic on-street advertising contract which has limited its bus stop amenities .
A step-by-step approach to BRT implementation makes sense to deliver quick benefits to riders , but it risks setting the bar too low and degrading the benefits of BRT . What Metro presently brands as BRT offers only slight improvements over Rapid service : for example , bus lanes on Wilshire are only active for five hours per day and will be absent in Westwood and Beverly Hills , which opted out . Even after full implementation Metro 's countywide BRT plan , none of the designated corridors would meet the “ Basic BRT ” standard set by ITDP or come close to being on-par with Metro 's rail facilities .
More than three quarters of Metro 's ridership is on buses , and many more people choose not to ride because the service and amenities are inferior to other alternatives : shelters , safety features , real-time arrival information , and way-finding elements are often lacking , even at the busiest stops . Frequency , speed , and reliability can be all-day issues given the ever-present threat of traffic congestion .
More robust bus improvements are necessary . These improvements not only benefit existing riders , they also make transit a more useful mobility option for millions of people .
What could a fully developed BRT network look like ?
Metro currently operates 400 miles of Rapid service , while other local providers have their own . In total , roughly 500 miles of Rapid services are potential candidates for improvements . 500 miles of true BRT is likely to be cost prohibitive , but it may be conceivable to imagine a mix of improvements such as :
100 miles of “ comprehensive ” BRT ( and complete streets enhancements ) that could qualify under the ITDP standards ( around $ 4 billion at $ 40 million/mile – assuming the cost of Metro 's East San Fernando Valley BRT project )
( and complete streets enhancements ) that could qualify under the ITDP standards ( around $ 4 billion at $ 40 million/mile – assuming the cost of Metro 's East San Fernando Valley BRT project ) 200 miles of BRT-lite “ Select Bus ” service featuring dedicated lanes and targeted bus stop and streetscape improvements ( about $ 2 billion at $ 10 million/mile – assuming double the cost of Metro 's Wilshire BRT project )
featuring dedicated lanes and targeted bus stop and streetscape improvements ( about $ 2 billion at $ 10 million/mile – assuming double the cost of Metro 's Wilshire BRT project ) 200 miles of signalization , bus stop upgrades , and minor street improvements ( roughly $ 500 million at $ 2.5 million/mile ) .
All together , a fully-upgraded Rapid/BRT network could cost in the ballpark of $ 6-7 billion—almost the total budget for the Grand Boulevards program , for which may feature additional non-BRT projects as well . This order-of-magnitude estimate does n't factor in improvements to the local bus network or associated increases in operating cost to maintain appropriate all-day frequencies for a core transit service .
Despite the cost , a robust BRT investment appears doable within the framework of Move LA 's proposal combined with a mix of local , regional , state , and perhaps federal funds .
For abstract illustrative purposes only , consider the conceptual rail network from Move LA 's Strawman Proposal overlaid with a countywide BRT concept , which assumes upgrades to most existing Rapid lines plus the addition of new BRT services .
This map represents a very rough idea of what an enhanced Rapid/BRT network could look like . The key takeaway is that investing in BRT across Los Angeles County could triple the size of the region 's rapid transit dream for a relatively affordable cost .
These corridor-level investments , when combined with complete streets improvements and transit-oriented zoning reforms , provide the framework for Los Angeles to become a true transit metropolis . Moreover , by addressing the regional geometry challenge , such an investment could achieve greater regional equity : many more people could have access to quality rapid transit service with investments in both rail and buses , compared to just rail . Ideally , rail and bus services would converge to the point that riding the bus would be nearly as pleasant , dignified , and efficient as riding the train , yet buses will serve more places and more trips .
Transit is crucial to the future of Los Angeles : the region is dependent upon expanding mobility options to unlock new opportunities for growth while achieving key environmental , health , and equity goals . Rail expansion will play a key role in reshaping Los Angeles , but a comprehensive investment in transit must extend beyond rail.Los Angeles needs to embrace bus improvements and BRT as core elements of its 21st Century transit vision to foster abundant , high quality transit service for all .

The deal was this : Mr. Clinton would endorse Mr. Obama for the White House in 2012 if Mr. Obama would endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton for president in 2016 , the book claimed .
At the same time , Mr. Clinton was n't completely happy about the deal — they would have preferred their wife challenge Mr. Obama for the White House in 2012 , Mr. Klein 's book claimed .
Bluntly , Mr. Clinton thought Mr. Obama was n't up to the job , Mr. Klein wrote .
In the book , Mr. Klein writes that several sources attributed Mr. Clinton as saying : “ I 've heard more from Bush , asking for my advice , than I 've heard from Obama . I have no relationship with the president — none whatsoever . Obama does n't know how to be president . They do n't know how the world works . He 's incompetent . He 's an amateur . ”
Nonetheless , Mr. Clinton ultimately endorsed Mr. Obama for a second term — at the pushing of political adviser David Axelrod , who was watching Republican challenger Mitt Romney 's rising poll numbers with alarm , Mr. Klein said in their book .
White House press secretary Jay Carney dismissed the report of Mr. Obama 's agreeing to endorse Mrs. Clinton .
“ I can assure you the president is not thinking about the next presidential election , having just recently won the last one , ” they said .
Mr. Klein previously penned books about Mrs. Clinton and the Kennedys and is a former foreign editor at Newsweek .

Harappan civilisation should be called Sindhu , Saraswati civilisation not Indus Valley : Dr Sharma
Source : The Hitavada Date : 24 Feb 2017 14:16:58
Staff Reporter ,
Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya ( IGRMS ) organised another chapter of Museum Popular Lecture where Dr Deo Prakash Sharma ( former Director , Bharat Kala Bhawan , Banaras Hindu University ) spoke on ‘ New Harappan excavation in Sarsawati basin ' .
Dr Sharma commenced their lecture with comment that Harappan civilisation should be called Sindhu-Saraswati Civilisation not Indus Valley Civilisation . Indus Valley was a name given by European Archaeologist ignoring the fact the region was between Sindhu and Saraswati River . They said , “ Sindhu Saraswati or Harappan Civilisation , existed along the rivers Sindhu and Saraswati basin all located in north-western part of South Asia . The area covered more than 2.6 million-sq km by the Harappan or Sindhu Saraswati Civilisation extended in west from Sutkagendor and Shahi tump on the Makran coast situated on the border of Iran and Pakistan in and East UP , to Alamgirpur , Hulas , Mandi and Shamlinagar , Chandayan , Sanauli , Nahcauli , Bulandi Khera ( Kulesara ) Noidaand Tappal ( near greater Noida ) all on old course of the Hindon river in western Uttar Pradesh , and Shurtaghai ( Afghanistan ) in the north to Daimabad in North Western Maharashtra . Tappal is eastern most Sindhu Saraswati site located on the old confluence of Hindon and Yamuna River in Aligarh district ” .
Dr Sharma delivered the lecture with PowerPoint Presentation they quoted Dr Bhadra from ISRO and said , “ Saraswati was mighty river between 6000-3000 BC . After 3000 BC water was receding in this river and Sindhu Saraswati people shifted and made their settlement on Indus Tributaries ” . They further said , “ References of Saraswati and Drishadvati in Rig-Veda . A G Gupta ( 2001 ) observed , there is clear evidence of Palaeo-channels on the satellite imaginary in the form of a strange and powerful continuous drainage system of Saraswati in north-west India and occurrence of 2,449 archaeological sites of early , mature . The existence of mighty palaeo drainage system of Vedic Saraswati during 6000-2000 BC . The trade networks , economically , integrated a huge area , including portions of Afghanistan , the coastal regions of Persia , northern and western India , and Mesopotamia .

Roger Ailes gave an interview to the ever-credulous TVNewser yesterday . One sentence jumped off the computer screen , as it almost certainly will to almost anyone familiar with Fox News ' brand of `` fair and balanced . '' Ailes said , `` We have no agenda . '' Even more startling , they were talking about their network 's coverage of President Obama .
TVNewser noted how the Obama administration has a `` chilly '' relationship with Fox News and asked how the next four years will play out .
“ It 's day to day for us , ” Ailes tell us . “ We do n't — I know no one believes it — we have no agenda . If they run into a burning building tomorrow and saves four kids , he 's gon na be the biggest goddamn hero Fox News ever saw . But if they leaf four guys behind on the battlefield but ca n't explain it , then he 's gon na have a problem with Fox News . ”
Well , nobody should believe Fox has no agenda . Because I can assure you that if President Obama were to say , kill America 's Number One Enemy , Fox would immediately diminish the accomplishment , attack them for not giving enough credit to George W. Bush and for spiking the football . Or , in Fox 's parlance , saying they did n't kill that .
Yesterday 's TVNewser puff piece was about the minority apprentice program at Fox . It sounds like a great program . But once those apprentices graduate to a job at Fox , they 'll soon discover just how alive and well bigotry is on those airwaves - from some of its most highly paid hosts - and its `` objective '' news shows , too .
So while Roger Ailes may truly believe they run a fair and balanced , diversity-friendly operation , honest-to-goodness news consumers can easily see the truth .
The number of British riders at the Yorkshire start of the Tour de France on Saturday is set to be lower than the last time the race started in the UK after Alex Dowsett was left out of Movistar 's nine-man team . The Essex time-trial specialist had expected to race but was hit by breathing problems , according to the team .
“ It 's so sad for us to leave Dowsett out , ” said the Movistar manager , Eusebio Unzué . “ Despite their efforts , they could n't get to their best form due to breathing problems resulting from an infection . ”
Dowsett had finished third in Thursday 's British time-trial championship and had failed to complete Sunday 's road race title , pulling out with 42km remaining . As expected Movistar will be led by the veteran Alejandro Valverde .
With Bradley Wiggins and Peter Kennaugh unable to make the cut for Team Sky , and it being revealed on Monday that Garmin-Sharp had left David Millar out of their team , that leaves three Britons confirmed for the Tour : the Welshman Geraint Thomas and the Kenyan-born 2013 Tour winner , Chris Froome , at Sky , and Mark Cavendish for Omega Pharma .
The Australian team Orica-GreenEdge have yet to confirm their lineup for the Tour but they were not expected to include either of their British prospects ; the twins Simon and Adam Yates . Orica-GreenEdge have previously said that , at 21 , they are too young to be thrown into the Tour .
In 2007 , when the Tour de France started in London , the field included five home riders : Wiggins , Cavendish , Millar , Thomas and the Italy-based Charly Wegelius , who now works as a directeur sportif with Millar 's Garmin-Sharp squad .

Made Us Look : Real-Life Instagram Street Art
You know how we 're always touting around new ways to turn your Instagram photos into real-life objects and prints ? Well , how about going backwards and turning the entire Instagram app into a real-life street art installation ?
Artist Bruno Ribeiro has taken it upon themselves to adorn the streets of London with a pretty thought-provoking and highly topical series , entitled Real-Life Instagram . They created an analog version of the app made of cardboard and different shades of cellophane ( read : filters ! ) and has been sticking it to posts or walls all over London to frame famous landmarks , unusual views , and even other pieces of street art !
And guess what people did when they started seeing their pieces ? Took out their phones so they could post it on Instagram . What ! Yes — it 's InstaInstagram .
As the artist told Fast Company , he 's not anti-Instagram . They love the fact that it has brought photography to everyone 's daily lives and has made people “ more observant of details — things we have n't seen before. ” But , they also criticize how Instagram is yet another way we are tethered to our phones . Every experience must immediately be Instagrammed , or it 's like it never happened . Of course , that 's not true at all but it is definitely a common mentality , even if it 's subconscious .
The project aims to help people to take a moment to notice things as they pass by . He 's put up 30 frames so far , choosing places they would post on Instagram if only they had their iPhone ; )
All in all , we think this is an awesome project ! It 's such a cool way of seeing an app come to life , quite literally .
What do you think of this project ? Do you use in Instagram on a daily basis ? Talk to us in the comments below .
The Obama campaign announced today what had long been suspected : Hillary Clinton 's former campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle was going to work for the Illinois Democrat . What came as a surprise was Solis Doyle 's title , `` chief of staff to the vice presidential candidate . ''
The move was seen as shrewd but potentially controversial . Solis Doyle was let go by Clinton because of what was widely regarded as poor campaign and financial management . But they still are a prominent Hispanic figure with ties to the former first lady -- attributes that could endear Obama to a sought-after political constituency .
One thing the move does suggest , insiders believe , is that Hillary Clinton 's chances of being tapped for the vice presidency are now slim to nil .
`` This alone means that Hillary wo n't be the V.P . choice , '' wrote one .
According to two close Clinton confidantes , the Senator and Solis Doyle have not spoken since their firing months ago . And there is a sense that bad blood lingers between the two . Some officials in Clinton 's orbit were disappointed , if not angered , by the fact that Solis Doyle had been in touch with the Obama campaign about possibly coming on board . Solis Doyle , meanwhile , is rumored to have felt particularly scapegoated by their firing .
Said one individual with knowledge of the Clinton campaign 's political leanings : `` It would be pretty awkward if Hillary Clinton were picked as vice president and Patti was there to be their chief of staff . ''
Indeed , while on the surface it may seem that hiring Solis Doyle would provide a soft landing for Clinton to be brought in as V.P. , others see their hiring as simply a logical political move .
`` Patti knows that world certainly and knows the kinds of things the vice president would do because they saw it so much in the White House , '' said a source . `` She is from Chicago and they know all those folks . I knew they had visited with them and they want to get on with their life too . ''
But time does heal wounds and in politics a shared objective like , say , the White House , could compel Obama to reunite Clinton and their former campaign manager .
Update : Jason Horowitz over at the New York Observer reports the following : `` A former bundler to Hillary Clinton just called in to tell me that Barack Obama 's selection of Patti Solis Doyle as chief of staff to the campaign 's eventual vice presidential nominee is the `` biggest fuck you I have ever seen in politics . ''

`` Either one of two things happen , '' said the bundler . `` Hillary is selected as vice president and they fire Patti , or Hillary is not going to be the vice president . ''
The Veterans Affairs Department opposes efforts to expand the Veterans Choice program and instead wants permission from Congress to roll several private care programs into the Choice benefit , VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson said Tuesday .
Addressing members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee in a legislative markup , Gibson said a bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , to let any enrolled veteran use the Choice program would `` erode the VA 's ability to address the special needs of veterans . ''
`` If veterans who currently do not use the VA health care system begin to seek community care through the Choice program , VA will have to divert resources from … internal VA care , dramatically undercutting our ability to provide care tailored to the unique needs of veterans , '' Gibson said .
McCain 's proposed bill would make permanent the Choice program , which is set to expire next year . It would allow any veteran who uses VA health services to use the program , which currently lets veterans get care at a private health facility if they live more than 40 miles from a VA facility or have to wait more than a month for an appointment .
The proposed legislation also would require VA to expand pharmacy hours and let veterans be seen at commercial walk-in clinics without preauthorization or a co-payment .
McCain said the legislation is needed because some doctors are refusing to see veterans under the Choice program , knowing it has an expiration date .
`` I 've heard testimony from a number of veterans who have sat in the ER for 14 hours without being seen . Veterans would just like to see a provider on the same day . This legislation would do that , '' McCain said .

A VA medical facility in California on Tuesday began letting enrolled veterans get health care at walk-in clinics with a referral . Gibson said implementation of a similar program nationwide would be cost-prohibitive with the current VA budget .
`` This provision is too broad and does not include any feature such as the inclusion of copayments that would ensure it is used in a measured way that would not overrun the funds appropriated by Congress , '' Gibson said .
Veteran groups that testified , including the Veterans of Foreign Wars , Paralyzed Veterans of America , Disabled American Veterans and American Legion , also said they oppose McCain 's bill , adding they believe issues must be fixed with the current program before it is expanded .
`` The Choice Program ... has yet to achieve what Congress envisioned when it passed the Veterans Access , Choice and Accountability Act , '' said Carlos Fuentes , senior legislative associate with the VFW .
McCain urged the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee to consider the bill , which they said will improve the original legislation co-written in 2014 by McCain and then-Senate Veterans Affairs Chairman Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt .
Terrance West is currently among the NFL 's top 10 rushers after week 1 of the regular season . I 'm not crowning anybody anything at this point but both they and fellow rookie Isaiah Crowell are off to very strong starts . This is a credit to their abilities as runners just as much as it is to the outstanding blocking they received vs. the Steelers , especially along the right side . By my calculations 78.5 % of the runs by our running backs executed went to the right side on Sunday .
During the first half our running backs ran right 6 times and left 3 times . During the second half 90 % of our running backs ' runs went to the right side ( 18 times ) and out of all their running plays in the second half , 94 % came while in 12 personnel ( 1 RB , 2TE , 2WR ) and while 72 % were run from the pistol formation . Of our second half running plays , 18 were run out of a no huddle vs. a first half where we so zero no huddle plays . The difference between the halves was evident , namely in yards and points with the Browns scoring 0 TD 's in the first half while rushing for 75 yards and then rushing for 2 TD 's and 111 yards in the second half .
Kyle Shanahan picked a weakness and kept exploiting it and the team kept executing . So much so that both Terrance West and Isaiah Crowell were able to average 6.5 and 6.0 YPC , respectively . West touched the ball 16 times and was able to rip off ( 2 ) 20 yard scampers for 100 total yards on the ground . West looked like the running back we saw from their highlights at Towson , showing great one cut ability , vision and burst through the hole . West also showed some wiggle and ability to make tacklers miss and initiate contact after the LOS .
Meanwhile Crowell touched the ball 5 times and achieved a first down 60 % of the time ( 3 touches ) for 32 total rushing yards . Crowell was hard to stop in the red zone , receiving 2 touches and earning 2 TD 's in this area of the field . The undrafted rookie did leave a third potential TD on the field due to the miscommunication on the play call at the end of the 2rd quarter , which would have been a key play for the Browns , bringing the score margin within 3 points going into the fourth quarter .
Both backs showed why they were coveted by the Browns . In the post game interview , head coach Mike Pettine mentioned that ( paraphrasing from clevelandbrowns.com ) -- “ Crowell was never in the game plan , it was always going to be Tate and West . They ( Crowell ) obviously prepared like a professional and was ready to play ” . I really liked hearing that because of the questions that swirled around their attitude coming out of both Georgia and then Alabama State . I have felt all along that they are our most talented RB and they appear to be seizing their opportunity .
First NFL Touchdown !
Their 1st TD was created by Kyle Shanahan setting up the Pittsburgh defense by coming out for the first three plays of the third quarter under center and in 12 personnel . Then once on the 35-yard line they used the pistol formation field in both run and pass plays , including this TD run by Crowell , their first touch of the game .
12 personnel , pistol formation .
Mack is going to chip the NT here and press them with their left hand toward Bitonio as they make their way to Shazier . Both Thomas and Bitonio are going to pick up the RDE and the NT , respectively . Meanwhile , Barnidge is going to block Jarvis Jones ; Gabriel is preparing for Polamalu ; and Dray is tasked with their LOLB . Schwartz and Greco are sealing the LDE and the ILB .
Mack is approaching the second level and is pressing the NT toward Bitonio as Crowell gets the ball . Both Bitonio and Thomas are on their man and have a decent push off the LOS . Meanwhile blocking looks solid for Gabriel and Dray on the bottom of the screen . The linebackers for Pittsburgh appear to be over pursuing to the right here .
Crowell makes their first actual cut left here . The pistol allows the offense to disguise the direction of the run until the last minute and here Crowell 's vision tells them that the pile is going to keep moving to their right , freeing up the lane outside Thomas ' left shoulder ( what would have been the pre-snap A-gap ) .
This is a thing of beauty . The stereotypical “ plants their foot in the ground and gets up field ” narrative . The burst out of this cut was fun to watch .
Following Crowell 's first cut , you can see them running behind their pads towards pay dirt . Thomas has pushed their man behind the NT . Meanwhile Bitonio has leverage and is about to seal their man inside , thus ensuring the lane is open for business .
Hard to see here because it 's a little blurry , but Crowell burst past Jarvis Jones and into the end zone for their first TD .
Here 's the Vine video :
Missed TD at End of Third Quarter ?
This run was also set up by no huddle offense featuring the pistol in both facets of the game . This is more a question and is subjective , but if you noticed how well the line blocked on this drive , and take into account both the vision Crowell had already shown in combination with burst and power , I feel this could have been another TD . While it 's purely speculation without knowing the play-call , it seems like neither Crowell nor Hoyer got the right play call and that this was a designed hand off and not a pitch .
22 Personnel
Here you can see Barnidge sealing their man to the outside and the lane that was clearly intended along with the point where Crowell should have approximately received the handoff .
Had Crowell taken the handoff vs. stepping out for the pitch , the three questions become : 1 ) could Crowell have beaten the DB coming around the block of Barnidge ? 2 ) Can Agnew seal the edge and the linebacker tracking to their left ? 3 ) With Bitonio about to clear through the trash and get a block on Palomalu , could Crowell have then beaten the ILB ( # 51 ) to the goal line ?
Not the way you want to end the third quarter .
Big scamper to the right
This play was once again set up by no huddle offense and the pistol formation . Hoyer had just passed to Hawkins ; then handed the ball off to West who ran right for 8 yards ; then threw an incomplete pass , again from the pistol and in a hurry up situation .
12 Personnel ; pistol formation
Crowell has the ball in their hands at this point , they can see Dray has their man sealed and is beginning to move them outside and they can also see the Miles Austin is free in the distance . It appears as though Schwartz is also in control of their man and Bitonio is releasing into the second level .
Boom . Crowell makes their cut , Dray has their man sealed . Bitonio is running with their man and is in position with inside leverage and a mismatch in size . Schwartz is also getting a good push with their man back inside .
Here you can better see the block from Schwartz allowing Crowell to turn up the lane untouched . Again Bitonio is running their man towards the sideline with leverage and Austin is up ahead waiting to block their man .
This is a very nifty piece of running from Crowell . The way they jump cuts back inside without losing balance or speed is quite remarkable -- - all while keeping their eyes up field .
Austin has finally engaged their man and has position on their outside shoulder allowing Crowell to make one last cut towards the sideline and the first down .
Love how they protect the ball here and “ runs behind their pads ” with good level and finishes this play be initiating the contact and falling forward for 3 more yards .
Here 's the Vine video :
Crowell 's 2nd Touchdown Run
This run shows such great vision , speed and once again Crowell 's ability to cut once and get up field in a hurry . They follow their blocks , is patient and then bursts into the lane . Another fun play to watch .
12 Personnel ; pistol formation
Crowell 's vision is apparent here . It does n't seem like he 's worried about what their OL is doing , they senses immediately that they are in a good position with their push off the snap . Schwartz has inside leverage . Dray also has leverage and you can see the lane opening up where Barnidge is running into . Crowell actually appears to be watching what the SS and DB are doing . They know Barnidge is running up to meet the DB and that Gabriel is free on the outside to attack the Palomalu . They also know that Greco is pulling from inside out to seal the LB at the top of the lane .
Here you can begin to see it all come together , this is all happening as they are getting the ball . Mack has their man sealed , Greco is making their way inside of Schwartz , Barnidge is looking at the DB and Gabriel is now tracking Troy .
Crowell still has n't cut yet , just watching the blocking unfold . . .
Here you can see Greco and Schwartz switching blocks , maintaining the top of the lane while Mack is still pushing their man backwards . Barnidge continues towards the DB .
Crowell still has n't made a cut yet , he 's just patiently following their blockers and running straight ahead at the same angle they took the handoff . Greco actually is falling backwards here and ‘ boxes out ” their man and pins them against Mack 's man , causing them to lose balance and knocking them both out of the play . Schwartz is now in position to seal the line backer as they follow the runner back up the field . Gabriel is engaged with Palomalu and Barnidge is in line to meet the DB .
Boom , there 's their initial cut up the field .
Crowell finishes their initial cut here . All the blocks have gone as planned . Worilds is the only man that is getting free from their block . Jarvis Jones and their RDE from the backside are in pursuit . Everyone else is sealed and a huge lane has opened and Crowell is attacking it .
Crowell cuts back outside to evade Jarvis Jones and the approaching DB then finishes the play with speed and power . TD !

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - China is worried it could face fresh criticism over its actions in the South China Sea when Singapore becomes chairperson of the Association of South East Asian Nations next year , and is putting pressure on the city-state to make sure that does n't happen , according to people familiar with the situation .
They say that Chinese representatives have told Singapore counterparts in private meetings over recent months that they do n't want trouble for Beijing when Singapore takes over the annual leadership of the 10-nation group in 2018 .
Diplomats say they believe that Beijing has used its influence over countries who have chaired ASEAN in the past to dilute the group 's stand on the South China Sea row , potentially one of the most volatile disputes in Asia .
The current chairperson is the Philippines , which hosted the group 's foreign ministers last weekend . ASEAN failed to issue its customary statement on Saturday because of what diplomats said was disagreement about whether to make oblique references to China 's rapid expansion of its defence capabilities on artificial islands in disputed waters . The statement was finally issued on Sunday .
A Beijing-based Asian diplomat familiar with the situation said there are concerns that Singapore could use the ASEAN chairperson position to try to `` internationalise '' the South China Sea issue , when China wants it limited to the countries directly involved .
`` China thinks Singapore , as a Chinese-majority nation , should listen a bit more to Beijing , '' the source , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters .
`` Beijing has made it very clear to Singapore what it expects on the South China Sea issue , '' said another Asian diplomat in Hong Kong who is familiar with the situation .
Singapore 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment for this story .
In a statement sent to Reuters , the Chinese Foreign Ministry said China supported Singapore 's work and `` believes Singapore will lead ASEAN to work with China to promote the raising and upgrading of practical cooperation ... and build an even closer China-ASEAN community of common destiny '' .
Singapore is not a claimant to any disputed part of the South China Sea but is home to the biggest port in Southeast Asia , and has made clear its open economy depends on continued free navigation in the area .
China claims almost the entire sea , which includes one of the world 's most busy trade routes and sits stop valuable oil and gas reserves . Taiwan and four ASEAN states - the Philippines , Vietnam , Brunei and Malaysia - have overlapping claims .
The United States says it does not have a position on the South China Sea dispute but will assert freedom of navigation rights in the waterway .
BACK ON TRACK
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told their Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan during a meeting in Manila on Sunday that ties had come back on track of late .
`` Relations between China and Singapore have experienced ups and downs . But close exchanges between the two countries ' leaders recently have enhanced mutual trust , which is essential to healthy bilateral relations between China and Singapore , '' Wang said , according to China 's foreign ministry .
Balakrishnan said the tone of their meeting with Wang was positive , Singapore media reported .
The worry for China is that Singapore has long-standing defence relationships with the United States and its allies , although the city-state says it is equally friendly with Beijing .
China is Singapore 's largest trading partner , and Singapore has been China 's largest foreign investor .
The United States and Singapore announced an enhanced defence relationship in late 2015 , which included deployments of long range P-8 surveillance planes out of Singapore - aircraft which freqently track Chinese submarines .
Singapore also has some ties with Taiwan , which Beijing regards as a breakaway province .
Tensions between the two countries burst into the open last November when Hong Kong port authorities impounded nine Singaporean armoured military vehicles being shipped home from training grounds in Taiwan . Hong Kong released the vehicles earlier this year amid rare open debates in both Singapore and China about a deteriorating relationship .
The Global Times , an influential state-run Chinese tabloid , said in June that the once `` special relationship '' between the two nations was fading away amid mistrust over the South China Sea .

My name is Katie Damm , and I am a third-grader at Bledsoe Elementary in Frisco . I 'm also a pescetarian ( a vegetarian who eats seafood ) .
My goal is to be a pescetarian for at least two years , but I may do it for the rest of my life . The main reason I am a pescetarian is that I wanted to try something new and do not like the idea of killing animals . But I still love seafood !
My two motivators are Haley , my baby sitter , and Jane Goodall , an animal-loving vegetarian and famed chimpanzee researcher . Haley is a vegetarian . They motivate me because I would n't have had the idea of becoming a pescetarian if it were n't for them They have given up all meat , and I think it 's really cool that they can do it .
Some things I like and eat more often now include kale , risotto , jicama , salads and seafood in general . I would like to try some more tofu . I 've had pot pie with tofu in it . Tofu almost feels like meat but not exactly , and it almost makes up for missing meat . Also , while being a pescetarian , I have started to eat less sugar .
It may sound hard , but it 's really easy . Yes , sometimes I get tempted , but I tell myself to stop and resist it . I am most tempted at holidays . At Thanksgiving , we have turkey , and now I ca n't have that . At Easter , we have ham , and I ca n't have that , either . Instead of ham , I had salmon cakes . Every time I go to the grocery store and see fresh salami , I miss that .
If you want to be a pescetarian or vegetarian , you need to take a few breaks but then become a full-on pescetarian or vegetarian . When I first had the idea , I tried to give up all meat . Sometimes there would be a dish I really wanted , and I 'd have it . But after a while , I decided to be a full-on pescetarian , with no meat .
You need all of the family members who live with you to agree with you and understand your feelings . Also , never give up .
Now , I feel lighter , healthier and just plain awesome ! I would definitely recommend others give it a try for at least a month . You will feel healthier in no time .
But if you want to be a pescetarian or vegetarian , you need to know it is always important to remember you do n't eat meat when you see it . ( I forgot that once ! ) I was at a birthday party sleepover . I accidentally ate pigs-in-a-blanket . I was n't even thinking and grabbed three ! I felt ashamed because I was a pescetarian and really did n't want to eat meat . You need to remember that you can stop whenever you want , but do n't start and stop over and over again .
It 's a really fun change to make . Try and get your family to try it ! So , get up , get moving and start a goal . It does not have to be like mine ; it could be anything ! Have fun with your goal ! Be creative !

When the Lewis and Clark expedition left St. Louis in May of 1804 the captains knew that they would face many challenges ; not the least of which would be the many illnesses and injuries that plagued them all the way to the Pacific and back ! Lewis 's crash course in medicine would be put to good use as they faced cases of : heatstroke , frostbite , hypothermia , a dislocated shoulder , strained back , various cuts and bruises ( from cacti , an axe , etc . ) , diarrhea / dysentery , syphilis , boils , a gunshot wound , fleas , lice , and other pests . There were also less clear-cut ailments like ague ( fever and chills ) , intestinal disorders , and stomach complaints . Such disorders might have been caused by bugs ( fleas , ticks , mosquitoes ) parasites in the food and water of the expedition , malaria , or other viral infections .
In the Journals of Lewis and Clark , the reader finds instances in which both explorers make reference to illness , and medical treatment . Yes , Clark served as camp doctor right along with Lewis ! Even though Clark had not had the advantage of formal training , they would have shared Lewis 's “ frontier upbringing ” and military background , so was quite proficient at ministering to the medical needs of their men . It is obvious that Dr . Rush had an impact on the young captains . On July 7 , 1804 , Clark wrote that “ one man verry Sick , Struck with the Sun. ” [ 69 ] They were referring to Robert Frazer , who according to Dr. David Peck , was probably suffering from heatstroke or heat exhaustion . The logical treatment for either ailment would have been shade , rest , and the consumption of liquids to re-hydrate the soldier . Clark wrote that “ Capt . Lewis bled them & gave Niter which has revived them much. ” [ 70 ] In this case , Dr. Peck notes that bloodletting probably worsened Frazer 's condition , leading to even further dehydration and exhaustion . Though Frazer survived , it was probably NOT due to Lewis 's treatment ! Clark used blood letting on at least two other occasions that are noted in the journals . On January 26 , 1805 one of the men was diagnosed with pleurisy ( an infection of the lungs and or chest cavity ) , and Clark wrote that they treated this man with a “ Bleed. ” [ 71 ] Clark also used the lancet on Sacagawea after they became ill in June of 1805 . On the 10th of that month , they noted that “ our Indian woman verry sick ” and recorded that they “ blead her. ” [ 72 ] Though we do not know what afflicted Sacagawea , Clark showed great concern for the young Indian mother , and tried several different treatments before affecting a “ cure ” .
In September of 1805 ( September 23 to October 1st ) , Clark wrote that the men were suffering from “ Lax & heaviness at the stomach ” and a “ running of the bowels ” . Their journal over several days “ is practically a hospital daybook ” . [ 73 ] They related that “ Capt . Lewis scarcely able to ride on a jentle horse . . . Several men So unwell that they were Compelled to lie on the Side of the road . . . 3 parts of the Party sick . . . Capt . Lewis very sick . . . ” and finally that they themselves was “ a little unwell. ” [ 74 ] Clark attacked the illness , probably dysentery caused by a change in diet , with “ Rush 's pills ” . Was it appropriate to give men disabled by dysentery a powerful purgative ? Such treatment gave them even worse diarrhea and caused greater intestinal irritation , and dehydration , but was the accepted medical treatment of the day . There are countless examples of the Captain 's using purgatives in the journals ; it was definitely the treatment of choice on the expedition !
On several occasions in the journals we see both the influence of the captains ' military background and Dr . Rush 's training . This was evident in the treatment of syphilis . Syphilis was considered a routine disease in the military in the early 19th century , and Lewis and Clark were well prepared to treat the disorder . It is obvious in reading the journals that the men had sexual contact with native women . Clark noted on October 12th of 1804 that the Sioux had a “ curious custom ” , as did the Arikara , which was “ to give handsom squars to those whome they wish to Show some acknowledgements to. ” [ 75 ] They go on to note that the party had “ got clare [ clear ] ” of the Sioux “ without taking their squars. ” [ 76 ] But by October 15 , 1804 Clark noted that the party had arrived at the Camp of the Arikara , and that “ Their womin [ were ] verry fond of caressing our men & c. ” [ 77 ] By March of 1805 they noted that the men were “ Generally helthy except Venerials Complaints which is very Common amongst the natives . . . and the men Catch it from them. ” [ 78 ] On January 7th 1806 , Lewis described the incidence of venereal disorders which they observed amongst the natives of the Columbia River Valley . [ 79 ] On that same day , they made a note that one of their men , Goodrich , “ has recovered from the Louis Veneri [ syphilis ] which they contracted from an amourous contact with a Chinnook damsel. ” [ 80 ] Lewis cured Goodrich , with the “ uce of mercury ” and tried to determine if the natives had any “ simples ” or cures for the disease but determined that they did not . [ 81 ] They also noted that both gonorrhea and syphilis existed amongst the native tribes west of the Rockies , but that the incidence of these diseases had declined when compared to the natives of the Plains . In July of 1806 , Lewis reported that two of the men , Goodrich and McNeal were “ both very unwell with the pox which they contracted last winter with the Chinnook women ” and determined to make use of an “ interval of rest [ so that ] they can use the mercury freely. ” [ 82 ] The use of calomel or mercury to treat syphilis was extremely common in the early 19th century ; “ But the administration of mercury to cure a nasty problem was a very sharp double-edged sword. ” [ 83 ] Mercury is toxic to the spirochete that causes syphilis , but it can also be toxic to the patient . The medicine could be given in one of two forms , orally ( usually by pill – calomel ) or via a salve ( usually applied under the arm ) . The topical application tended to work more slowly , but was safer as the mercury was absorbed slowly into the system . With either application , “ side effects of the mercury could cut nearly as deep as the syphilitic bacteria. ” [ 84 ] It was generally known that treatment should end when the patient began to salivate excessively . Today we know that “ salivation is the first sign of mercury poisoning. ” [ 85 ] In addition to salivation , patients often experienced mouth sores and bad breath . Their teeth often became loose or fell out , and their mouths turned brown . In severe cases a patient might suffer “ inflammation to the mouth , throat , and intestines , causing pain , nausea , vomiting ” and diarrhea . [ 86 ] If exposure to the mercury continued , and the poisoning became chronic , the patient would experience a “ red body rash , sweating , loss of appetite , increased heart rate ” , and might suffer kidney failure and death . [ 87 ] Though Lewis 's treatment of their men in this case could have been lethal , there was little alternative . At least with mercury there was a chance that the disease could be stopped before it advanced to the second stage or beyond .
Why did n't the captains ask their men to abstain from sexual encounters , or use some sort of contraceptive device to lessen their risk of infection ? Lewis and Clark did ask the men to abstain for a time at Fort Clatsop on the Pacific Coast , but their reasons were related to commerce not the prevention of disease . The men grew accustomed to trading goods for sexual favors amongst the Clatsop and Chinook Indians . By the winter of 1805-1806 , with supplies dwindling , the Captains cut off this practice to conserve the Corps trade goods for the return trip . While condoms seem a good modern solution to the problem , they were not commonly used in America in the early 1800 's . As early as the 17th century Europeans ( led by the French ) had learned that covering the penis during intercourse could help to prevent syphilis , and condoms made of “ oiled silk , fish bladders , and the intestines of goats , sheep , or cows ” were widely available by the early 1700 's . [ 88 ] In the United States , the first recipe for condoms appeared in 1844 ( yes , you could make them at home ) , but they did not become widely available until the 1850 's , alas too late for poor Goodrich andhis fellow explorers ! [ 89 ]
Lewis and Clark would be forced to deal with many medical problems on their expedition . While the training that Lewis received from Dr . Rush was evident in their use of blood letting and purgatives , we can also see the influence of their mother 's herbal arts , and their military discipline and training . The Corps of Discovery would travel over 8,000 miles from 1804 to 1806 , and only suffered one death . Sgt . Charles Floyd would become ill on August 19th ( 1804 ) . Clark noted that “ Serjeant Floyd is taken verry bad all at once with a Biliose Chorlick we attempt to relieve them without success yet. ” [ 90 ] Floyd grew worse over night and was dead within days . Most historians and Dr. Peck agree that Floyd was probably suffering from appendicitis , which would have proved fatal even had they been attended by Dr . Rush himself . It is amazing that the Corps which consisted of 33 men ( and Sacagawea ) was able to travel so far , with so few fatalities . But , as Dr. E. G. Chuinard stated in their book Only One Man Died , “ the generally non –scientific basis of medical practice at the time permitted . . . [ Lewis and Clark ] . . . to care for their men as well as a graduate physician of the day might have done. ” [ 91 ] Throughout the journals , the men of the expedition exhibit only confidence in their captains . Even in the case of Sgt . Floyd 's death there is no hint of criticism . Patrick Gass wrote , “ Floyd died , notwithstanding every possible effort [ that ] was made by the commanding officers , and other persons , to save their lives. ” [ 92 ]
Though many of the treatments used by Lewis and Clark offered little potential for real healing , and may have done more harm than good , the men would have received nothing better in a 19th century hospital . Medical technology simply had not reached a professional state by 1804 . Doctors , like Benjamin Rush followed inaccurate theories , guessed at the cause of disease , and used treatments that were as likely to kill as to heal . As physicians , Lewis and Clark both performed admirably . They showed care and concern for the men under their command and even for the Indians they met . They used all the information available to them at the time to keep the Corps safe and healthy . The “ practical skills ” of most doctors of the day were not much better than those “ possessed by Meriwether Lewis ” , and “ as an amateur , Lewis was probably more conservative in their treatments than a trained physician , whose unfounded confidence in their medical abilities would likely have made them more aggressive. ” [ 93 ] Lewis and Clarks ' conservative treatments probably helped to insure the health of their party . The expedition they led was an absolute success . The captains not only opened the west , they brought every man but one home with them , safe and sound !

My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic is still an absolute force when it comes to the children 's market , and Shout ! Kid has parlayed that fame into a compilation DVD containing five memorable episodes of the show ( Twilight Time , The Cutie Pox , Pinkie Pride , The Cutie Mark Chronicles , and Flight to the Finish ) ; these choice episodes are taken from seasons 1 , 2 , and 4 . Of the included episodes , The Cutie Mark Chronicles is perhaps the strongest as it provides a great introduction for those individuals that had not been wholly immersed into the Little Pony : Friendship is Magic mythos previously .
The video quality of these MLP episodes is as sharp as the initial airing , while they are whole episodes ( rather than being interspersed with a number of commercials ) . The audio quality is similarly sharp , meaning that viewers will be able to hear every line of dialogue and utterance no matter whether they are watching on a laptop , a portable DVD player , or in their home . Shout ! Kid has further increased the value of the Adventures of the Cutie Mark Crusaders by including some additional features . There are a set of downloadable wallpapers that would look good printed out for a bedroom , while an additional sing-along makes for a more interactive experience than what is typically presented on children 's ( or cartoon ) DVDs . The Adventures of the Cutie Mark Crusaders DVD is available at a wide variety of online and brick and mortar locations and represents a stop-gap measure until the show begins to air in the second quarter of 2015 ( we 'll announce the airing date when we hear about it ) . Expect to pay around $ 15 for a copy of Adventures of the Cutie Mark Crusaders .

Picuntu and Linuxium Linux on Measy U4A Android dongle
Installing and benchmarking classical Linux desktops on cheap Android dongles based on RK3188 chip
Measy U4A is a typical Android HDMI dongle . This one and many more are made in China in great quantities and in low prices . Just check you local stores , ebay or Chinese shops like dx.com . Such dongles when attached to a HDMI TV or display and powered will run Android allowing you to watch videos , play music , browse the web and what not .
Android gives a lot of apps but it 's not Linux . Makers/hackers/developers often want to use a small embedded PC for some other tasks and would really want to have plain Linux instead of Android . The dongle I 've picked is one of dongles based on a quad core RK3188 SoC . This one is quite popular and there are various development tools for Rockchip based devices . There are also Linux distributions that can be installed on them ( Picuntu ) or booted from SD card ( Linuxium ) . So in this article I 'll give a quick look at the Measy U4A dongle with Android 4.4.2 and then I 'll go to installing and testing Picuntu and Linuxium .
Measy is one of better known brands in the dongle business . They offer a wide range of such devices and accessories . U4A dongle is good , but it 's not the latest model . It has 1 GB or RAM while newer come with 2GB . Aside of that it has the same RK3188 SoC , USB host and HDMI connectors . The RK3188 used well known quad core Mali 400 GPU unit ( MP4 ) which can handle some less demanding games and a lot of multimedia .
By default the dongle was sold with Android 4.2 , but now Android 4.4 is available as an upgrade that you can install on it using a PC and some apps ( more on that later ) . Cheapest RK3188 dongle on dx.com is priced at around $ 50 . If you want to install Picuntu or Linuxium on it be sure to pick the one that has a recognizable name and there are reports on the web about installing one of those distributions on them . Less known dongles may have some differences that can make it harder to install or run those Linux distributions on them ( like for example unsupported wifi module ) .
There are newer dongles based on Amlogic S802 with much more powerfull Mali 450 and soon there will be RK3288 with even more computing powers . The Amlogic SoC is n't compatible with Picuntu or Linuxium although there are tutorials on how to install Linux on such devices . I 'll stick to RK3188 here .
The dongle I got ( second hand ) was already updated to one of Android 4.4.2 ROMs . It offered basic apps , including Google Play and SuperSU . I 've run some benchmarks and installed few other apps just to check how it 's working . In Antutu it got 13463 points , which is quite good for a such device . In Futuremark Ice Storm Unlimited got 2637 , and Ice Storm Extreme 1951 ( 18 and 10 FPS ) . Vellamo in multicore benchmark gave 1057 points , 478 in Metal benchmarks and 1219 in browser benchmarks .
The system was quite responsive , no lags or other issues were found during this short usage . One thing was strange - the OS was configured to save energy and unneeded cores were shutdown . In some cases like starting a move at start the playback was a bit slow but after few seconds it would be normal . Other dongles I played with did n't have such behavior ( or it was unnoticeable ) .
What surprised me was FTDI UART support out of the box . Such UART devices are used by some USB devices like GPS dongles or RFID readers/writers . The most important usage is providing a USB interface in some microcontroller boards - like pyMCU . I could connect to that board using one of Android apps for serial communications , but still in QPython I got permission problems as QPython application did n't ask for the USB permissions like the serial apps did .
Picuntu is a Linux distribution that supports dual core RK3066 devices and quad core RK3188 devices . It replaces the Android installed on the device .
There is a compleate installation package with Picuntu 4.5 and all the Windows applications needed to install it on the device . For Linux users there is rkflashkit application that can burn Picuntu system images from that package onto the device . For MS Windows you will have to install Rockchip USB drivers first , and then use the applications provided in the package .
Extract the archive and go to rk_flash_1_37 and run RKAndroidTool . The application will report that the device is missing . You have to connect the dongle using the USB OTG port with the PC . The device must be connected in recovery mode for it to work . In most cases the device will have a small hole for this where a metal pin , needle can be used to push a small button inside . You have to connect the device to the PC while having that button pressed . When you do so the RKAndroidTool will see the device ( at first Windows will try to match the drivers ) .
By default RKAndroidTool will have all partitions selected to burn . Pick only : loader , parameter , kernel , boot , system . Click Erase NAND and then Flash ROM . That will start the Picuntu installation on the dongle . It may take few minutes . After that you can disconnect the device .
Connect the dongle to the display , connect power and in few moments you should get Picuntu booted and ready for action . The user is picuntu and the password is 12qwaszx .
Depending on dongle the WiFi module may or may not work . In the case of Measy U4A it did work . Most Android hardware does n't full hardware support mainlined into the official Kernel or uses binary blobs and other nasty stuff that works best under Android . In the case of RK3188 devices we can run Linux on them but not everything will perform as good as on Android - for example video acceleration ( VPU support ) . Mali 400 3D acceleration is also not easy to get . You can forget about performance available on weak x86 integrated graphics . In many cases it will be much worse .
On the bright side things that do not need GPU magic will work quite nicely , like LibreOffice start quickly and does n't lag when using it . Linaro-Ubuntu repositories provide quite rich package collection .
Some other Mali 400 devices , like Radxa Rock or Cubieboard , Cubietruck single board computers do have OS images with full Mali 400 acceleration enabled . This seems to perform a bit better , but still not that much better and with the same multimedia limitations .
To get some performance numbers I 've run Phoronix benchmarks to compare it against Raspberry Pi , Odroid X2 , Cubieboard and others . You can check the first and second set of benchmarks . You can also run comparison benchmark on you PC .
Here are few results from those benchmarks :
C-Ray , pybench an Pi calculation
RAMSpeed and mp3 encoding
RK3188 is quite close to Samsung Exynos 4412 found in Odroid X2 . Picuntu is noticeably slower in RAM speed , but that may vary between dongle model . Old single core Raspberry Pi and PcDuino are much much slower .
We can also look at Chromium GPU acceleration under chrome : //gpu URL :

Linuxium is a combination of Android ROM and a bootloader with support of booting additional OS from a bootable SD card . So in comparison to Picuntu we can have Android on NAND and Linux on bootable SD/MicroSD card . Installation is described in linked forum thread as well as on Google+ . Download bin.7z archive , extract it and flash images using RKAndroidTool just like we did with Picuntu . After that you should get a working dongle with Android . To get Linux on SD/MicroSD you will have to burn it on that SD card using different tools ( dd under Linux ) or scripts provides with given image . Under Linux it would be :
dd if=linuxium-ubuntu1204-desktop-rfs.img of=/dev/SD_CARD_DEVICE_NAME bs=4M
And when it ends run sync and you are done . The device name will be next /dev/sd * device ( like /sda will be you HDD and after plugging the SD card sdb will show up ) or /dev/mmcblk0 and alike .
when you put the SD card and boot the dongle you should be able to pick an option ( usually 1 ) to boot Linuxium Linux from that card . In the OS there is linuxium user with password p. Root has no password and you can set it if needed ( sudo passwd root ) .
On Measy U4A the Xubuntu boots from SD card , but the Android does not run correctly . It was designed for Rikomagic devices and in my case I got a black screen with not very responsive interface .
Linuxium Xubuntu may look better but it works just like Picuntu . The OS is in an old version and it prompts to update to 13.10 Saucy Salamander . Using do-release-upgrade in terminal I 've updated it to that version and one more time to update it to current 14.04 Trusty Tahr . First upgrade did work , the second one ended with few X.org packages with a dependency conflict ( so not fully configured system in the end ) . That may have some negative implications as the OS did seem to be less responsive .
Chromium in 12.04 was in 31.0.1650.63 version and reported :

In Trusty Tahr it was at 34.0.1847.116 and reported the same thing , although without listing few options . The Kernel does n't upgrade and we are stuck with 3.0.36+ .
I 've made some benchmarks for Linuxium before and after upgrade . As you can see the upgrade did affect X.org as x11perf results were lower after upgrade . Nginx benchmark get a better result , while other did n't change noticeably .
Linuxium multi-booting idea is quite handy . Sadly not all hardware performance is available under Linux . I assume that on Intel Atom based tables that should look much better . There are also AMD low power SoCs but they are n't available now in such devices . If Rockchip wants to put incoming RK3288 in Chromebooks it ought to provide better classical Linux/X.org support for its chips ... unless they will make it more closed project .
For makers/hackers such Linux running on a very cheap dongle may be quite handy It has 1-2GB of RAM , has four CPU cores and should handle webcams ( with OpenCV ? ) , and other USB devices ( like microcontroller boards ) . The dongles are quite small unless you need those bigger ones with Ethernet and multiple USB ports .
There is also Radxa Rock development board . It costs more than the cheapest dongles but it gives dual Android/Linaro Xubuntu OS configuration , WiFi , Ethernet , and GPIO ports not to mention some other smaller goodies and full Mali 400 support .
Let me start out by coming clean : I am a closet Trekkie .
I went to my first `` Star Trek '' convention when I was nine . I have owned dozens of `` Star Trek '' toys , models , props and books over the years ( and yes , I used to make my Kirk and Uhura action figures kiss ) . I even have a communicator app on my iPhone ( and I 'm eagerly waiting for the tricorder app now that Siri has arrived ) . I do n't own a uniform , but I wish I did ( Hint hint : Channukah 's coming , family . I 'll take the classic Captain 's shirt in M , please , so that it rips easier when I get into fights ) .
My love of `` Star Trek '' began at an early age and has lasted to this day . But why ? It is n't just because of the campy sets and costumes that are still iconic . It is n't because of the terrific performance by Leonard Nimoy ( Spock ) or Captain Kirk 's Shatnerific overacting . It is n't even because of the superb sci-fi storytelling and writing or the fact that the toys and accoutrements were ( and are ) so cool that the culture seems to be obsessed with making them real . Although all of that is true .
No , my love of `` Trek '' has lasted this long because of what I have learned from my friends on the Enterprise over the years .
From the joys of exploration to the simple pleasures of curling up in your own quarters ( often with a hot yeoman and a cold drink ) , from the value of friendship to the value of calling someone 's bluff , I 've learned dozens of life skills , lessons and even values from the iconic show that ran only three years in prime time when it originally debuted ( before I was born ) .
I think that 's what ultimately motivated me to create and publish ( via my company , Quirk Books ) `` THE STAR TREK BOOK OF OPPOSITES , '' as an attempt to familiarize children today ( including my own ) with the world of `` Trek . ''
There are no great life lessons in `` THE STAR TREK BOOK OF OPPOSITES '' ( although learning the difference between BIG and LITTLE , HOT and COLD would certainly serve anyone well ) . But beyond the basics of opposites , the book is a great way to introduce kids to the world and characters of `` Star Trek , '' in the hopes that someday they will come back to it and begin to appreciate its power and cultural resonance .
I would say there are seven life lessons I learned from `` Star Trek '' that I take with me to this day . These are lessons I hope to pass along to my own children someday -- but for now , I will share them with the interweb .
The best way to travel is to boldly go where no one has gone before . This is true for vacations , for self-exploration , for life itself . If you want your days filled with adventure , laughter , love , learning and the occasional mind-meld , follow this route .
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few -- or the one . Sometimes you must make great sacrifices for the greater good . And , like the Genesis device , it will all come back around .
Expressing your emotions is a healthy thing . Sure , McCoy seemed angry all the time when exclaiming , `` Dammit , Jim ! I 'm a doctor not a mechanic/bricklayer/soothsayer , '' but they knew that by expressing their anger and frustration it would n't get the best of them and they could then perform at their peak capacity .
When estimating how long a job will take , overestimate -- and when you do better your captain will always be impressed . Replace the word `` captain '' with `` teacher '' or `` mom/dad '' and you 'll see what I mean . Sure , Mr. Scott might have been telling the truth -- maybe it would take six hours to get the warp engines back online in the heat of the battle . Or maybe they were padding things so they looked good . Either way , when the engines did come back online , everyone was happy .
Wearing red makes you a target . This is true of cars , dresses and , most especially , shirts . Red gets you noticed -- which is good if you want to be noticed , bad if you do n't want to end up vaporized .
When you do n't know what to say , pause . It will give you the time to figure it out . Or at the very least , you 'll sound like you 're being thoughtful . `` But .... Spock ..... why ? ''
The most powerful force in the universe is friendship . It 's more powerful than phasers , photon torpedos , even more powerful than the force itself . With friends , you can accomplish any task , escape any perilous situation , defeat any enemy -- and you get to laugh together when it 's all over .
A few months ago , Lucasfilm announced that they were putting together a new team called the Story Group . This group of Canon champions ( including Leland Chee and Pablo Hidalgo , two long-time curators and mavens of the EU ) had the task in place to ensure that everything that was created within the Star Wars universe would be interconnected and adhere to Canon . Everything . This included movies , TV shows , Novels , comics and games . No more Mandalorian Contradictions . No more Even Piel double-deaths . None of the contradictions that had long troubled the Expanded Universe and annoyed us detail-oriented fans . This noble group was going to fight for consistency and universe-building on behalf of EU fans everywhere . No group since rogue squadron had ever been created to fight for the good of the EU .
Except that they also blew the whole thing up .
That 's right . While the Story group will be doing incredible things moving forward ( and I really AM excited to see how much they will improve the new canon ) they completely nullified everything before . In order to allow complete freedom to the new , integrated , multimedia universe that was blooming , everything that already existed would have to go ( as far as canon was concerned ) . It seemed , at first , like a huge blow to the gut of this Star Wars fan . All of that time and effort sunk into the Expanded Universe seemed to have been wasted . My favorite characters would never make it to the movies . There really is no such thing as a Yuuzhan Vong ? !
But after some time to digest , that reaction seems silly now . The “ old expanded universe ” now known as Legends is still a great read and a worthwhile part of my fandom . Here are a few reasons why :
1 ) The story is still the same :
This may seem unnecessarily obvious , but nothing about the story told among those Legends novels has changed . No really , it has n't .
When we consider the stories as the history of the universe we all love , sure… in that case it no longer exists . But if we take a deep breath and remember that they are stories… that has n't changed at all . We all have stories that we love that are not tied to a franchise we obsess over . And you know what ? We still love those stories . If you separate the stories from Star Wars , what do we have left ?
We have great characters . As a matter of fact , most fans of Legends would say that the Big Three is the least compelling and interesting of the bunch ! Jaina , Jacen , Saba , Daala , Vestara , Plagueis ( for the most part ) all exist completely within the Legends Universe .
We have great stories . The X-Wing books are incredible as adventure stories with or without Star Wars attached to them . The same goes for every other book and plot as well . The stories are still great .
We have an improved Canon . This is probably a tough concept to grasp , but is incredibly important to realize . That internal canon of the novels still exists… it 's just not the canon of Star Wars . Characters live and die on the same timeline . Jacen 's decisions during the Dark Nest crisis still causes a Galactic Civil War that leads to Luke 's expulsion from Coruscant . Thousands of years later , the Yuuzhan Vong still tell the legend of The Ganner . It 's all Legends canon… it 's just not Star Wars canon . As a matter of fact , the canon gets improved when you look at Legends in isolation . Most of the continuity errors came from cross-platform media ( and when I say “ cross-platform media ” I really mean The Clone Wars ) . Now that the books are disassociated with the new continuity , they get to exist on their own and many of the canon-debates can be closed .
Just because they are n't officially Star Wars does n't mean that we should n't enjoy every thing about these books that we always have . And if you 're someone who has n't read Legends before , it does n't mean you wo n't enjoy them as great stories in a self-contained universe .
2 ) Who knows what will stick around :
As I watched the prequels , one of the most interesting aspects of the story to me was the planet Coruscant . I was pretty intrigued by the idea of a galactic political base and an entire city-planet . It seemed like a pretty thriving place full of diversity , urban challenges and an overwhelming sense of business and urgency . It was the exact opposite of Tatooine in every way… and pretty dissimilar to Hoth and the forest moon of Endor as well . I remember being impressed that they seemed to really break the mold that had been established by the original trilogy .
I should point out here that I did n't get into the Legends novels until after the saga was completed… meaning I had n't read the Zahn trilogy until after Episode 3 was out . I point this out because Lucas did n't create Coruscant , Timothy Zahn did . To be fair , they may have based the idea on Lucas ' notes and outlines… . But that 's not the same thing . Zahn named the planet . Zahn gave us our first description of the planet . Zahn decided what it looked like , who lived there , and how the government center was organized . Zahn made it real and Zahn made it known .
Star Wars fans can be finnicky and so we tend to focus on all of the times that there was tension between the “ George Lucas ” Star Wars and the “ Expanded Universe ” Star Wars . But we should n't forget that George and other LucasFilm producers borrow successfully from the Expanded Universe all the time . Coruscant is probably the most obvious example , but did you know that Kashyyyk and Twi'lek are expanded universe words as well ?
Countless ideas in the Prequels and in The Clone Wars were taken from the Expanded universe and , while occasionally it led to continuity disasters , for the most part it was exciting to see the species , people , and creatures I had read about being brought to life on the screen . I can only imagine how much MORE intrigued I would have been with Coruscant had I already been invested in it from the novels .
With this change to continuity , there 's no reason to expect that the Story Group wo n't still be pulling material from the Legends stories . I imagine we will see plenty of planets , species and concepts from the Legends universe . No , the events did n't happen… but I would n't be surprised to see a few Barabel in the coming movies . And with the new story group in place , it means we could see similar creations showing up in movies , TV shows and even future novels , as well .
I ca n't wait to see what gets carried over either as central aspects of the new canon or even as little Easter eggs in the films , and I ca n't wait to see what improvements they make in the process .
3 ) It 's going to take a while before we have a new universe to take its place :
So most of my reasoning comes from the perspective of an existing fan responding to the changes , but this point is for all of the potential fans wondering whether or not they should get started on the Legends books despite their lack of canon status .
The cold , hard truth is that it is going to be a long time before the new efforts of the Story Group come to fruition . It 's already been a long time and there has n't been a new book written yet . Of course it takes a lot of preparation and planning to undergo an effort this big… . I 'm not begrudging them the ability to make this transition and to do it right ; I 'm simply stating that it will be a while before it gets up and running .
And then it will be another while before it is as full and vibrant as the Legends universe is today .
For most fans of the Star Wars novels , we got into them because we wanted more than watching the movies over and over ( although we still do this ) . Many of you might be thinking the same thing and Legends is there for you , just like it was for me . Rather than waiting and waiting for the new Canon to take hold , why not dive into Legends and enjoy the ride ?
Canonicity is something that I really do believe is important . The internal Canon of the Legends books will always be what draws me to them . Thousands of years of interconnected history in the Galaxy Far , Far Away makes for an incredible reading experience . Officially , it 's no longer canon… I get it . But if a new reader were to jump in today , it would still be great and it would still be Star Wars . Some day , when the new canon is vast and developed it may be time to say that Legends became a mystical relic of the past , but that time is not now . Now it should still be embraced as the greatest expansion to the greatest franchise we all love . It 'll help pass the time until Episode VII comes around . It 's going to be a new era for the franchise once that happens anyways .

Reagan Tries to Silence Reports of Iran Arms Deal
At the White House , spokesperson Peter Roussel said , `` The United States has systematically urged Third World countries not to sell arms to Iran as the only effective way to bring Iran quickly to accept mediation and negotiation ( in the Iran-Iraq war ) . ''
Earlier this week , Iran said it had expelled former White House national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane and four other Americans on a secret mission to mend U.S.-Iranian relations .
The Los Angeles Times and other newspapers reported that the United States won the release of three hostages in Lebanon by helping to arrange the shipment by Israel to Iran of aircraft spare parts and equipment needed to keep the Iranian war machine running . ( Story , Page 10 . )
WASHINGTON — President Reagan today tried to quiet reports of a deal with Iran for the release of American hostages in Lebanon , saying disclosures of the contacts between Tehran and Washington `` are making it more difficult for us '' to win the release of the three Americans still held captive .
Reagan and Roussel refused to comment on the authenticity of the reports but said the disclosures could jeopardize efforts on behalf of the hostages .
Replying to a question during a bill-signing ceremony , Reagan said , `` No comment , but could I suggest and appeal to all of you with regard to this , that the speculation , the commenting and all . . . to us has no foundation , that all of that is making it more difficult for us in our effort to get the other hostages free . ''
Later , spokesperson Albert R. Brashear refused to identify which story or stories Reagan had in mind when they said it had `` no foundation . ''
Dan Howard , another White House spokesperson , said that `` what has generally been referred to as an arms embargo with regard to Iran . . . is a very technical business . . . . There are several bits and pieces to this , all of them very technical . I think it 's a very technical business . ''
At a briefing for reporters , Roussel refused repeatedly to discuss whether the United States played any role in supplying arms to Iran or had looked the other way while other countries did .
They said at one point that in terms of the arms embargo , the U.S. made no distinction between arms and spare parts . Later , they changed their answer to `` no comment . ''
`` Because there are American hostages still being held in the Middle East , this Administration will not respond to any questions about any steps we might be taking to secure the release , '' Roussel said .
Recalling Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite 's warning on Wednesday that speculative stories make it more difficult for them to secure the hostages ' release and , at the same time , endanger their life , Roussel said , `` I would urge all of you to be very cautious in what you put forward as fact . ''
The Times reported today that the arms shipments were approved personally by the President and have angered both Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger .

British banks may have to hold more funds to guard against the risk of a future economic downturn .
The Bank of England wants to reduce the chances of banks needing taxpayer bailouts .
The Bank said that the level of reserves compared to loans could rise from 3 % to 4.95 % from 2019 .
That means banks would need to hold £1 of capital for every £20 they lend , compared with £1 for every £33 today .
Mark Carney , the governor of the Bank of England , told the chancellor : `` The committee believes that its proposals for the design and calibration of the framework will lead to prudent and efficient leverage ratio requirements . ''
George Osborne must approve the proposals , and said in response that there would need to be further consultation with lenders on the impact of a higher leverage ratio . The ratio is the minimum amount of capital that banks must hold relative to their exposure to loans that could fall in value .
The Bank has devised a complex calculation for the leverage ratio , whereby the minimum level will be based on several factors , including the size of the bank , where Britain is in the credit cycle , and other issues yet to be finalised .
As a result , the minimum leverage ratio for most banks is likely to be far lower than 4.95 % . If the economy is regarded as weak and lending prudent , the leverage ratio would only go as high as 4.05 % .
Analysts had expected the ratio to be increased to between 4 % and 5 % , which they said banks could adapt to as long as they had several years to reach it .
Bank shares rise
Investors welcomed the better than expected news , sending shares in Barclays up 8.2 % by the London close to 241p , while Royal Bank of Scotland jumped 6.2 % to 388p .
A spokesperson for Barclays said the bank had a leverage ratio of 3.5 % and was on track to exceed 4 % in 2016 : `` Therefore we are very confident that we will exceed the requirements set out today with our existing plans . ''
Lloyds gained 2.6 % and HSBC added 1.65 % .
Andrew Tyrie , chairperson of the Treasury select committee , said it was vital that the Bank of England 's Financial Policy Committee ( FPC ) set the leverage ratios at an appropriate level .
`` The FPC may have found an ingenious , albeit somewhat complex means of calibrating the leverage ratio to the risk-weighted capital framework . The Treasury committee will be taking evidence on the extent to which they have succeeded , on the level itself , and on other aspects of these important proposals , '' they said .
The Bank of England 's proposal is the latest in a series of steps since the financial crisis aimed at making banks protect themselves better against future risks and avoiding a repeat of the £66bn taxpayer bailout of RBS and Lloyds Banking Group .
Banks have argued that Britain is going too far beyond global rules . They claim that forcing them to hold excess capital reduces their profits , increases the cost of lending and could cut the amount of credit available to home-buyers and companies .
The Bank of England said that safer banks would find it cheaper to raise funds , and that large banks that operated with dangerously low levels of capital effectively received a public subsidy because investors think taxpayers will step in to stop them failing .
The ease of Python , SQLite , and Storm
I began learning Python this spring , and I must say , the more I program in it the more I like it . I chose the language because of the libraries that are available for it . There is a library for everything . : ) Also , there are tools for Natural Language Processing that are a great help , but that 's for another time and another post .
I was originally thinking about using Postgres , and it would probably give me better speed and scalability . But then , I began to think if I really needed a full RDBMS for my application . After all , I 'm not expecting the project to get too large , and being able to easily move it from one computer to another by just moving a single files sounds very convenient . SQLite has a great page to see if it 's right for you . I ended up settling on SQLite , and so far am happy with the decision .
Installing SQLite was a breeze . I just opened the package manager in openSuSE and installed the packages . I also installed the python Storm package . There is no daemon process , as there is with Postgres , because you 're just accessing one file on your filesystem . There is a great tool for setting up a SQLite database called SQLite Manager . It will let you create tables , view your data , and run queries . The fact that it 's available as a firefox extention makes it easy to install on many platforms .
Now is when the real fun begins . Enter Storm .
Storm is an object relation mapping ( ORM ) tool for Python . It allows you to manipulate the database through the manipulation of Python objects . After you map your python objects to database tables , you manipulate them , and your changes will show up in the database for you . I 've used other ORM tools in the past ( Hibernate for Java ) , but I was amazed at the simplicity of the setup/configuration step when using Storm .
It takes two lines to connect to your sqlite database :
DATABASE = create_database ( 'sqlite : db_name ' ) # or simply create_database ( 'sqlite : ' ) for in-memory STORE = Store ( DATABASE ) DATABASE = create_database ( 'sqlite : db_name ' ) # or simply create_database ( 'sqlite : ' ) for in-memory STORE = Store ( DATABASE )
Mapping a class to a table can be done with ease . Here is an example of one of my classes :
class Sentence ( object ) : __storm_table__ = `` TABLE_SENT '' sent_id = Int ( primary = True ) loc_id = Int ( ) location = Reference ( loc_id , Location . loc_id ) sentence = Unicode ( ) def __init__ ( self , sent , loc = None ) : if loc : self . location = loc # sent can not be None if not isinstance ( sent , unicode ) : self . sentence = unicode ( sent , `` utf-8 '' ) else : self . sentence = sent class Sentence ( object ) : __storm_table__ = `` TABLE_SENT '' sent_id = Int ( primary=True ) loc_id = Int ( ) location = Reference ( loc_id , Location.loc_id ) sentence = Unicode ( ) def __init__ ( self , sent , loc = None ) : if loc : self.location = loc # sent can not be None if not isinstance ( sent , unicode ) : self.sentence = unicode ( sent , `` utf-8 '' ) else : self.sentence = sent
If you access loc_id , it will give you the database id . If you access the variable without location through a Reference , it will hand you the corresponding database object .
Now , I set this up in about 45 minutes from start to finish , so it might need some more fiddling , but overall it seems to work pretty well . I needed to set something up in one night to keep moving on other parts of the project , and this allowed me to .
It ca n't all be sunshine and rainbows , there was one thing that tripped me up a bit . Being new to Python , I was n't aware of the u ” String ” for unicode . It was used in their examples , and after I got an error assumed that 's what it was for , but it tripped me up . As you can see in my constructor , I added some code to handle the case when a string that is n't unicode is passed in .
As I get into the more advanced aspects of SQLite/Storm , I hope I continue to be impressed .
California voters passed the Street Terrorism and Prevention Act , or STEP Act , by ballot initiative in 1988 . The STEP Act provides criminal penalties against anyone who “ willfully promotes , furthers , assists or benefits from any felonious conduct ” by gang members . What voters likely did not realize in passing the law is that it might be used to sweep anyone who had any ties to a gang—sometimes , ties so tenuous that defendants would n't know they had them—behind bars .
Since the law 's enactment , more than two dozen cases have been brought alleging “ gang conspiracy ” as the act defines the term . In many of these , such as 2013 's People v. Johnson , the charges also include actual violence . Duncan 's case is the first in which prosecutors have alleged that the rap lyrics and a couple of Facebook photos alone are sufficient to connect a defendant to a “ gang conspiracy . ”
Duncan has never been convicted of any crime . According to police records , they were a member of the Lincoln Park Bloods when they were a teenager in 1997 , but Duncan 's beefs with rivals most often took the form of rap battles . They were arrested together with two Bloods members in 2008 on pimping charges , but the charges were dismissed . Duncan says they have since given up any gang “ fam ” for a real one : their seven young kids and their girlfriend .
Duncan grew up in one of the most violent San Diego projects . Of their music , they say , “ It 's entertainment . It 's not real. ” Duncan has compared themselves to Rick Ross , a former corrections officer turned rapper , explaining that their own raps are just telling the stories of urban communities . In “ Fly Away , ” they rap about their volatile beginnings and their struggle for a better life : “ One day it 's the sunshine , next day the rain came , but deep down inside you just playing the blame game. ” Other lyrics criticize the gang life , as in “ Wicked City , ” where they ask , “ Crime pays ? What the fuck you talking 'bout ? ”
The bizarre case of Brandon Duncan illustrates what 's at stake in Elonis v. United States , a pending First Amendment case argued before the Supreme Court in December . Elonis raises the question of when words—in Elonis ' case , a series of Facebook posts—become criminal . The justices ' issue is a technical one : crafting the proper standard for determining whether a communicated expression is a “ true threat. ” Should it be enough to prove that a “ reasonable person ” would have known the words sounded like a threat , or should the government have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant intended them to be a threat ? Lurking behind that issue is the question of who judges the words of marginal figures like Tiny Doo .
Unlike Tiny , Anthony Elonis is not a recording rapper ; but after their wife left him , they began posting “ rap lyrics ” on a Facebook page . They seemed to be threatening to harm their co-workers , their ex-wife , FBI agents , and children at nearby schools . The judge in the trial instructed the jury to evaluate Elonis 's lyrics by the “ reasonable person ” standard . They were convicted on four counts of making threatening communications and sentenced to three and a half years in prison .
The salary hike is linked to an overall increase in public sector pay in Scotland .
Holyrood : MSPs have had a greater workload to deal with this year . © Deadline
Holyrood 's politicians are set for a pay rise which will take MSPs ' basic salaries to £62,149 .
The 0.6 % increase has been proposed by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body ( SPCB ) , which manages the running of institution .
The rise is an increase of 0.6 % compared to their current salary of £61,777 .
Since 2015 , MSPs ' salaries have been directly linked to public-sector pay rises in Scotland rather than MPs ' pay , as in the past .
MPs at Westminster are currently paid £74,962 - 20.6 % more than their counterparts at Holyrood .
Overall spending by the Scottish Parliament is set to rise from £97.6m this year to £102.3m next year .
Scottish Conservative MSP Jackson Carlaw , who is a member of the SPCB , told Holyrood 's finance and constitution committee on Wednesday that the parliament was facing pressures , including increased parliamentary activity , the impact of Brexit and ongoing reform .
Carlaw said : `` It 's the corporate body 's view that our parliament is busier than ever , it 's facing significant change and this , combined with the impact of its new powers , means that it 's no longer sustainable to continue to fund these recurring costs from our contingency .
`` Therefore , the corporate body proposes a budget which aims to reflect the new circumstances the parliament faces and , in doing so , it proposes a medium time financial plan which seeks to address known pressures , anticipated risks and opportunities to improve parliament 's performance in a planned and proportionate manner through to the end of this session . ''
They told the committee Holyrood has had a 45 % increase in overall business in the first year of the current parliament compared to the first year of the last parliament , with more and longer committee meetings affecting resources .

Ricky Gervais has been tenderized . After years spent taking the piss out of celebrity culture on Extras , tormenting their best mate Karl on An Idiot Abroad , and laying siege to our nerves as a wretched middle manager on the original BBC version of The Office , Gervais is now ready for something more kindhearted .
In their latest television series , Derek , the 51-year-old Brit plays an earnest , socially crippled rest-home worker surrounded by geriatrics , misfits , and begrudging volunteers . “ In most comedy , you 're laughing at the person , ” Gervais says . “ You 're laughing at the blind spot between how they see themselves and how you see them . But Derek is sincere . There 's no joke with him. ” Gervais describes the titular character as childlike , innocent , and “ not smart. ” They had originally intended to drop Derek into the dog-eat-dog milieu of standup comedy , but says , “ It was slightly more snarky . There 's something adolescent and toothless about irony . ”
Perhaps it was their three-year stint as the tart-tongued host of the Golden Globes , where Gervais notoriously ribbed and bruised the egos of the awards ceremony 's celebrity attendees ( “ Just looking at all the faces here reminds me of some of the great work that was done this year… by cosmetic surgeons ” ) , that soured them on continuing to lambaste the fatuousness of fame . “ I just got tired of media , ” they say matter-of-factly . “ So I went back to basics with Derek . It 's a sitcom . There 's no veil of irony . ”
Derek premiered earlier this year on Channel 4 in the U.K. , and will soon be available for streaming on Netflix . Gervais sealed the deal with the on-demand video site after sending an email to chief content officer Ted Sarandos that said , “ Netflix is the future . I want to do something. ” Sarandos quickly replied , “ Anything you want. ” Over a cup of cappuccino at the Four Seasons Los Angeles hotel , we asked Gervais to consider an alternate future—one populated by robosimian sass , zero-gravity urination , and the total evisceration of eight-legged arthropods .
ON BEATING DEATH THROUGH CRYOGENIC FREEZING :
“ My first thought , apart from it being so strange and narcissistic—and assuming that everyone wants to live forever , which I certainly don't—is that I 'd need my girlfriend and all my friends and family to be frozen with me . It would be too weird otherwise . I 'd be starting over at 51 with people going around in space suits and , you know , hoverboards looking at me weird . I do n't think I 'd do it unless the scientists said , ‘ We can freeze you for a year and we 'll have this drug ready by then . It 's either that , or you 're going to die tomorrow . ' Then I might do it , but certainly not to see the future . I ca n't be giving up the next however many years I 've got with my loved ones to see how Coca-Cola turns out . ”
ON POPULATION CONTROL :
“ I think it comes down to a single question : Should I have two kids or nine ? When I see a woman wearing leggings and smoking a cigarette , their bloke with their shirt off and no teeth drinking strong lager , and their eight kids running around , I want to go , Can I see your child license ? Can you pass some tests before you continue multiplying ? I would n't let you have a gun and I would n't let you have a pet , so how have you got all these human beings ? It 's dangerous . We 're moving into eugenics now . It 's fascist . [ In mock voice ] ‘ Ricky Hitler Gervais said the working class should be sterilized at birth . ' Honestly , the real answer is discerning breeding . You do n't need to have 12 kids . It 's not compulsory . ”
ON ROBOT BUTLERS :
“ I 'd probably make it look like a chimpanzee . It 's cruel to do that to a real chimp , so I 'd have a robot made to look like a beautiful wild animal with no emotions . [ Makes chimp sounds . ] He 'd be called Jeeves , and he 'd have a little tuxedo on . Actually , I 'd make them sarcastic . I 'd go , Another whiskey , please . And he 'd go , ‘ Another one ? ' I 'd go , Yeah , another one , Jeeves . He 'd go , ‘ It 's your life . ' In fact , I 'd like all of my technology to have a little attitude . My voicemail would say , ‘ You have one message . I forgot to ask who it was . They said it was important . ' The TiVo would be like , ‘ You do n't want to watch that . It 's awful . They really overact . ' ”
ON ZERO GRAVITY :
“ The first thing that comes to mind is eating crisps like Homer [ from The Simpsons ] . The second thing is having a wee . ”
ON MOON VS. MARS LIVING :
“ I 'd choose the Moon because it 's closer . When I get asked to do a movie , I 'm always like , Is it filming in L.A. or New York ? I always want them to say New York because it 's closer to London . Still , I think Mars would feel more like home because of the gravity . I 'd be walking around whistling with my monkey butler . ”
ON BEING BIONIC :
“ I want to be able to fly , so somehow I 'd like to be equipped with a jetpack . I just want to be up there alone . I do n't want to be in traffic . I do n't even care if my flight is 30 feet in the air , just as long as no one punches me in the stomach . Actually , wait—I want Wolverine claws coming out of my hands . I need titanium fists . ”
ON ACTING GLOBALLY :
“ I 'd like people to stop thinking , ‘ Oh you were born in that country—that 's unlucky . ' Not worrying about people in developing countries running out of water or oil is rather like not caring that your neighbor 's house is on fire .
ON EXTINCTION :

Dawn of War 3 is on the face of it a real-time strategy game , but dig a little deeper and the influence of the hugely popular MOBA genre is plain to see .
Ever since developer Relic Entertainment revealed the long-awaited sequel , players have noticed this MOBA influence . Up to this point , it 's been felt in the game 's focus on Elite units , which work similarly to , for example , the Champions from League of Legends . I 've spoken with Relic about the Elites before , but to recap , Dawn of War 3 's hero units are responsive , easy to see on the battlefield and have varied and impactful abilities .
But the MOBA influence on Dawn of War 3 extends further - deep down into the very core of the design of multiplayer .
At a recent event , I got the chance to play Dawn of War 3 's multiplayer for a few hours , and left struck by just how much of its design felt influenced by the MOBA genre . And to Relic 's credit , the developer does not shy away from this decision . In fact , it embraces it .
Dawn of War 3 's multiplayer revolves around destroying the enemy 's core , which is found inside its base . But to get to it , you must destroy a turret . To destroy a turret , you must destroy a shield generator .
There 's a flow to competitive multiplayer that feels very MOBA . You can make a beeline for the enemy base , but it 'll be so heavily defended by the incredibly powerful turrets that there 's no real point . So , you need to play ball , picking a shield generator to destroy , which makes its associated turret vulnerable . Once that 's destroyed , you 've opened up a path to the base .
Remind you of anything ?
Dawn of War 3 multiplayer revolves around destroying the enemy core . There is no other way to play .
Then there 's the design of the maps . The 2v2 and 1v1 maps I played all followed a three lane layout , with a clearly-defined top , mid and bottom . A shield generator protects a turret in each lane . Only two lanes , top and bottom , are viable to pursue early to mid game , though , because you need to bring down a bridge on either side of mid to reach the enemy base . Bringing this down takes a lot of time , so the action is funnelled to top and mid , concentrating fire and fuelling fights .
`` MOBAs are definitely something we 've looked at , '' Relic game designer Philippe Boulle tells me .
`` When we went to make Dawn of War 3 , specifically the multiplayer , we did spend some time looking at MOBAs and decided to pick and choose some lessons there . Obviously heroes with big , bold abilities is something MOBAs do quite well . What we liked about the objective in those games , and the lesson we took , is creating some specific places on the map that become concentrations especially for the late game - quick things you know you want to attack , you know you want to defend .
`` Now , that creates places where we can make the gameplay space interesting . That 's one thing . And it also gives some intermediary objectives . You 're not going to rush into the opponent 's base in the first minute because they have these big turrets that are going to stop you , but making a rush for a shield generator is a totally viable strategy . ''
Relic is going all in on the `` destroy the core '' objective for multiplayer . In fact , you ca n't play multiplayer any other way .
`` That is the multiplayer game at launch , '' Boulle confirms . `` Other modes are definitely something we want to explore post-launch , but at launch it 's this power core gameplay mode . ''
What this means for the feel of Dawn of War 3 's multiplayer is that it 's a more dramatic affair . Yes , the base building , resource gathering and big armies of previous games in the series is present and correct , but you can tell the developers are trying to make this version of the game more immediately action-packed , with the potential for comebacks around every turn .
`` The biggest danger for us in terms of making a really fun strategy game is dead man walking syndrome , '' Boulle explains , `` where something happens early in a match , you know it 's going to lead to victory or defeat , but you have to go through another half hour of play .
`` We wanted you to be able to probe the opponent , to be able to take a generator , lose a generator and still come back from it . ''
In the early game , you 're capturing points while trying to destroy and defend shield generators .
Fuelling this feel is an under-the-hood mechanic called escalation . This divides up a multiplayer match into phases . In the early game , resource flow is relatively low , but losses are quite forgiving . As the escalation increases , the reimbursement goes down but the resource flow rises , and the health on generators , turrets and the power core increases .
So , early game you 're encouraged to probe the enemy and perhaps get into combat without an early loss determining the match .
Talking of comebacks , all the races have a mechanic seemingly designed to trigger dramatic swings in momentum . You 've probably seen one of these global powers before : the Space Marine 's orbital laser strike obliterates all in its path , with a cool graphical effect to boot . But the Eldar 's Eldritch Storm works similarly . The Orks ' Rokz power is best though . It 's basically the best game of hot potato you 've ever seen - they drop a tractor beam beacon that any unit friend or foe can pick up and move around the map . Pick it up and move it into the most dangerous place , or the place that 's least dangerous . Things get really interesting when you pick up the beacon with a unit that can teleport - or Gorgutz , one of the Orks ' Elite units , who can use their chain fist to leap big distances .
Those powers are an on-your-nose comeback mechanic , but the way each race plays at an even fundamental level seems to have it in mind . Let 's look a little closer at the Orks . Yes , like previous versions of everyone 's favourite cockney space aliens , Dawn of War 3 's Orks are all about getting up in their opponent 's face with overwhelming numbers . But this time around they have a cool new trick up their sleeve : scrap .
Mid-game , you 're after the enemy turrets , which do a huge amount of damage to your troops .
In Dawn of War 3 , the Orks have ways to generate piles of scrap metal . Anytime a vehicle is destroyed they leave these piles , too . Orks can interact with them . Scra is like a secondary economy for them .
So , any Ork unit can upgrade by right-clicking on a piece of scrap , and they 'll gain new abilities specific for that unit . Boyz gain armour and more health , for example . Shoota Boyz gain grenades . Tankbustas can start summoning Bomb Squigs .
Gretchin , the Ork builder unit , can build vehicles at a discount and faster from the larger pieces of scrap . This sparks a cool late game situation where after a big fight with vehicles , Gretchin come in and start building Death Koptas , Deff Dreads and Killa Kans just from the mass of wreckage that 's left behind . When you 're on the receiving end of a surprise new army , it can feel like , where did this come from ? ! But when you play as the Orks and pull it off , it feels great - and it 's perfectly in keeping with what I imagine the Orks should be about , lore wise .
And of course , scrap is a good comeback mechanic . It is , essentially , a way of turning the tide , or delivering forces in an unexpected way . All the races have them .
And end-game , you 're after the enemy power core , which is in the middle of the enemy base .
The most encouraging sign for me is that after playing Dawn of War 3 for four hours straight , I left wanting for more . It 's a huge amount of fun , and whatever your take on the mechanics of the thing , what is certain is that Relic has once again nailed the Warhammer 40k feel . You can tell the studio lives and breathes 40k by the way the Orks move , by the way they stomp around , shouting at each other , beating their drums and screaming bloody murder . For years Relic has done 40k better than any other developer , and I see no reason why Dawn of War 3 will change that .
Not everyone will be enthused by this new direction for Dawn of War 3 , and I get that . In truth , the game feels like a curious hybrid of not just RTS and MOBA , but of the first two Dawn of War games . It 's an interesting mishmash of games and genres . Yes , it 's different , but then it had to be I get the sense that Relic is taking a long-term view with Dawn of War 3 , one informed by the hope the eSports community will pick it up . As interest in the RTS genre waned , Dawn of War had to change , and Dawn of War 3 is Relic 's answer .
You know that guy who comments “ first ” on every single article on the internet ? That guy sucks and no one likes him . They have no friends and contributes nothing to society . But when it comes to Philly 's Beach Slang , we ca n't help but identify with First Guy . See , way back in April , we got wind that James Snyder of Weston fame was working on a new project and when we heard their then just-released EP , Who Would Ever Want Anything So Broken ? , it was love at first listen . We were proudly the first to post the EP and heaped a butt-ton of praise on it , calling it “ the summer EP to end all summer EPs ” ( because it is ) . Soon after , our friends and fellow appreciators of killer summer jams over at places like Pitchfork , BrooklynVegan , and The AV Club also publicly declared their immediate love of the Slang . The band soon found themselves with a fanbase , a booking agent , and a label home at Tiny Engines before they even played a single show .
So it 's not inaccurate to call Beach Slang a “ buzz band ” given how quickly they caught fire and became media darlings . But unlike many buzz bands , Beach Slang really does live up to the hype . You do n't have to be a Weston nostalgist to appreciate them ( although it does n't hurt ) . There are plenty of other familiar influences to go around in their sound—with subtle hints at Jawbreaker , the Replacements , and even early Goo Goo Dolls .
Now , Beach Slang are keeping the ball rolling with a follow-up EP , Cheap Thrills On A Dead End Street and it 's another four songs of the same rapidly infectious heart-on-sleeve rock and fucking roll . Snyder sure knows how to craft an anthemic lyric when they whisper-shouts , `` It 's Friday night and I 'm in the basement/ Screaming out my lungs with my best friends ! / I hope when I die/ I feel this alive ! '' It 's just enough to hold you over as the band readies the release of their much anticipated debut full-length . With the excitement built around it , we 're just going to go ahead and say it : Beach Slang is the best new band of the year . And we 're not afraid to call “ first ” on that .
Listen to a song from Cheap Thrills On A Dead End Street called “ American Girls and French Kisses ” below . Pre-order the EP ( out on October 28 ) from Tiny Engines right here .
Beach Slang is also doing a run of shows with Modern Baseball , including a free one that Noisey is putting on tomorrow night at Brooklyn Night Bazaar . Get there early because it 's gon na fill up fast .

Republicans Move to Establish Second Special Counsel to Investigate Hillary Clinton , Susan Rice , President Obama
The_Real_Fly , Zero Hedge , Jul 29 2017
The grounds for war have been laid . You know it and I know it . The Demagogs have forced the Thugs into a small corner and have been scratching away at their fat faces since election night . For every action , there is is reaction , basic physics . Rep Gaetz and a few dozen other republicans are now calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the great and many crimes of the previous administration and Hillary Clinton . Rep Gaetz said :
The Pindo creeple has a right to know the facts , all of them , surrounding the election and its aftermath . We urge you to appoint a second special counsel to ensure these troubling , unanswered questions are not relegated to the dustbin of history . I do n't think that the crimes of the prior administration , of Hillary Clinton , the collusion with James Comey and Loretta Lynch should be forgotten just because Hillary Clinton lost the election .
Here is their 14-point request .
We call on a newly appointed special counsel to investigate , consistent with appropriate regulations , the following questions , many of which were previously posed by this Committee and remain unanswered : Then-AG Loretta Lynch directing Mr Comey to mislead the Pindo sheeple on the nature of the Clinton investigation ; The shadow cast over our system of justice concerning Sec Clinton and their involvement in mishandling classified information ; FBI and DOJ 's investigative decisions related to former Sec Clinton 's email investigation , including the propriety and consequence of immunity deals given to potential Clinton co-conspirators Cheryl Mills , Heather Samuelson , John Bentel and possibly others ; The apparent failure of DoJ to empanel a grand jury to investigate allegations of mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and their associates ; The Dept of State and its employees ' involvement in determining which communications of Sec Clinton and their associates to turn over for public scrutiny ; WikiLeaks disclosures concerning the Clinton Foundation and its potentially unlawful international dealings ; Connections between the Clinton campaign , or the Clinton Foundation , and foreign entities , including those from Russia and Ukraine ; Mr Comey 's knowledge of the purchase of Uranium One by the company Rosatom , whether the approval of the sale was connected to any donations made to the Clinton Foundation , and what role Sec Clinton played in the approval of that sale that had national security ramifications ; Disclosures arising from unlawful access to the DNC computer systems , including inappropriate collusion between the DNC and the Clinton campaign to undermine Sen Bernie Sanders ' presidential campaign ; Post-election accusations by the President that they were wiretapped by the previous Administration , and whether Mr Comey and Ms Lynch had any knowledge of efforts made by any federal agency to unlawfully monitor communications of then-candidate Trump or their associates ; Selected leaks of classified information related to the unmasking of Pindosi personal identities incidentally collected upon by the intelligence community , including an assessment of whether anyone in the Obama Administration , including Mr Comey , Ms Lynch , Ms Susan Rice , Ms Samantha Power or others had any knowledge about the “ unmasking ” of individuals on then candidate-Trump 's campaign team , transition team , or both ; Admitted leaks by Mr Comey to Columbia University law professor , Daniel Richman , regarding conversations between Mr Comey and Pres Trump , how the leaked information was purposefully released to lead to the appointment of a special counsel , and whether any classified information was included in the now infamous “ Comey memos ” ; Mr Comey 's and the FBI 's apparent reliance on “ Fusion GPS ” in its investigation of the Trump campaign , including the company 's creation of a “ dossier ” of information about Mr Trump , that dossier 's commission and dissemination in the months before and after the 2016 election , whether the FBI paid anyone connected to the dossier , and the intelligence sources of Fusion GPS or any person or company working for Fusion GPS and its affiliates ; and Any and all potential leaks originated by Mr Comey and provided to author Michael Schmidt dating back to 1993 .
The critturs wrote :
We have no interest in engendering more bad feelings and less confidence in the process or governmental institutions by the Pindo sheeple . Rather , our call is made on their behalf . It is meant to determine whether the criminal prosecution of any individual is warranted based on the solemn obligation to follow the facts wherever they lead and applying the law to those facts .
Gaetz tears into Clinton , Rice , Obama and the whole cabal , calling for an investigation into these matters .
And here is the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee , Rep Goodlatte , discussing the hypocrisy of the left , wanting a Russian investigation but not one that pursues the truth in the sundry of apparent crimes committed by the previous administration and Hillary .
With AG Sessions under pressure to deliver , I would not be surprised to see dueling Special Counsels investigating both matters at the same time .
W.C. Heinz wrote for the New York Sun from 1937 until it ceased to exist in 1950 .
Jim Murray personified sportswriting for the L.A. Times between 1961 and 1998 .
Shirley Povich wrote for the Washington Post their entire professional career .
Frank Deford has spent almost their entire career writing for Sports Illustrated .
I fear we may see never their kind again .
Today , we live in a world driven by greed and me-first and what-have-you-done-for-me-lately . And never is more evident than in the world of sports journalism .
How many sportswriters have jumped ship for a `` better '' offer in recent months ? I 've lost count . And that 's criminal .
There was a time when men were men and sportswriters worked at the media company they started with until either of them dropped dead . You did it because that 's what you were supposed to do . You did it because that 's loyalty .
Somebody offers more money ? It 's just money . Someone offers you a better spot or more access ? Who needs that ? Someone gives you a promotion ? That 's just self-serving .
Things should always be done like they were in the 50 's because the 50 's were the greatest period in the history of the world because of honor and loyalty and America and Jesus .
And by God , we 've lost our way .
There was a time when I could expect to go to ESPN.com and see silly columns written by Pat Forde with pictures of girls young enough to be their daughter strewn throughout . Now I have to go sifting through Yahoo ! Sports for that .
Used to be you could turn on ESPN Radio to hate-listen to Doug Gottlieb or turn on ESPN to hate-watch him . Now it 's unclear where I can do my hate-listening and hate-watching .
There was a comfort in knowing Erin Andrews was getting a lot of attention for doing a useless job on ESPN for college football . Now she 'll be doing that useless job for the NFL ? Will that uselessness even translate ? ? ?
I live in a world where Brett McMurphy breaks stories and ESPN refers to them as `` sources . '' Now you 're telling me that ESPN is going to directly reference McMurphy when they break now ? Up is down and day is night .
Kentucky Wildcats fans and Georgetown Hoyas fans took comfort in knowing that when the New York Times printed a Pete Thamel story , it was laced with misinformation , Syracuse alumni bias and liberal nonsense . Now that Thamel is going to work for Sports Illustrated , it does n't make sense . Did Rush Limbaugh tell me Sports Illustrated is a liberal rag ? Is it now ? Will they stop writing about Syracuse now ? Probably !
The world is ruined and it 's all because these sports journalists threw away years of honor and code and loyalty just so they can accomplish personal goals , take care of their families and do what 's best for them .
SHAME . ON . THEM .
Thank God for people like Chris Berman and Dick Vitale and Digger Phelps , who come out week after week , doing the same schtick every single time and never changing or improving or doing anything other than settling into a caricature of their former selves . Because that 's what doing the right thing looks like .
Things should remain the same always and you should always be loyal to your employer , regardless of any fact . Everyone knows this . But no , we live in a world of `` taking care of yourself '' now . It 's disgusting and immoral .
Where 's the concern for your former employer ? You know , the one that could fire you without cause at any moment ? What about their feelings ? Sure , there will come a time when your loyalty and years of service will be cast aside for financial reasons , but , what does that have to do with anything ?
Have fun cashing your bigger paychecks while doing your job in an environment that feels right and safe for you and your families . Jerks .
With the way this preseason is going , quarterback Tarvaris Jackson could be traded or released by the Seattle Seahawks within the next week and a half .
Originally drafted by the Minnesota Vikings , Jackson signed with the Seahawks in 2011 and was immediately handed the keys to the offense . And then Seattle signed former Green Bay Packers passer Matt Flynn and drafted Russell Wilson this offseason , apparently making Jackson the odd man out .
So what 's going to happen if Jackson gets sent packing by the Seahawks ? Well , there appear to be some people who believe that the Vikings could have interest in bringing back their former starting quarterback .
“ Assuming Flynn/Wilson are healthy after [ Friday ] game , expect Tarvaris Jackson to be traded [ Saturday ] . Many teams interested , [ including ] Miami , GB , Minn , SD , ” Jason Cole of Yahoo ! Sports said via Twitter .
Although this seems like a farfetched idea on the surface , the Vikings might see Jackson as a more-suitable backup than Joe Webb . Through the first two preseason games , Webb has been less-than-impressive as a passer ( 11-26 , 93 yards , 52.5 QB rating ) and is n't developing the way the Vikings were hoping they would . Especially with injury-prone Christian Ponder as the starter , Minnesota might want more insurance than Webb can offer .
Jackson 's time in Minnesota was a roller coaster ride to say the least . After leading the Vikings to the playoffs in 2008 , they were replaced by veteran Brett Favre and never regained their status as starter . The Seahawks came a knockin ' in 2011 and it appeared that ties were severed for good .
Now , two years later , it appears that the Vikings could be looking to rekindle the relationship that appeared to be burnt out . I guess desperate times do call for desperate measures .

For the Record : We 're stuck with the Electoral College forever
CLOSE It 's time for America to get up to speed again on the Electoral College , that oddball way the nation selects its president every four years . ( Dec. 15 ) AP
America is holding another election today , and you 're not invited . Five hundred thirty-eight voters will , in all likelihood , confirm what we learned Nov. 8 : Donald Trump is the next president of these United States ( barring a massive secret movement to deny them the 270 votes they need ) . The Electoral College is the Macarena of American politics : We can barely remember why we started doing this , there are way too many steps , everyone hates it , and we 're just going through the motions anyway .
Electoral College to meet today in DC . And Bismarck . And Carson City . And ...
Planning a protest at the Electoral College today ? We have some bad news for you . Although it sounds like a debate society , it 's not an actual place where people get together and debate the merits of the nominees . It 's just an imaginary institution that exists only in myths ... like King Arthur 's Court , or Trump University . The electors never meet ; they simply show up at their state capital and go through a few formalities to cast their ballot .
So although a majority of Americans feel like electors should be informed of the allegations of Russian hacking , there 's not an opportunity to run off copies and distribute handouts to the 538 voters . They 're not even all meeting at the same time , let alone the same place . 270toWin has it starting at 10 a.m. EST in four states and wrapping up by 7 p.m. EST in Hawaii . The protests are happening nonetheless ; they 're just happening in 51 different cities .
Democrats : 'Good luck with your kamikaze mission , guys ! '
Over the weekend there was a last-minute $ 500,000 advertising push to convince electors to choose anyone but Trump .
Will it work ? Ohio Gov . John Kasich , a relative moderate and the most-often-named alternative , has told electors they do n't want their votes . As of Monday morning , there does n't appear to be any sort of organized group of Republicans looking to deny Donald Trump the nomination ... which is just how they would want it to look , probably ! Of course , the more likely explanation is that the Republican electors all plan to vote for Trump as scheduled . It would be political mass suicide for any of the Republican electors to join the `` faithless elector '' effort ... and there are n't enough electors lining up to drink the Flavor Aid right now .
Republicans took to the airwaves Sunday morning to call the protests an effort to de-legitimize Trump 's election .
`` The whole thing is a spin job , '' incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told Fox News Sunday . `` And I think what the Democrats ought to do is look in the mirror and face the reality that they lost the election . ''
`` The entire nonsense about the electors trying to use the Russian hacking issue to change the election result is really unfortunate , '' Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told CBS ' Face the Nation . `` I think that actually undermines our democracy more than any other conversation that we 're having right now . ''
Why do we do this again ?
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy . — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 7 , 2012
First , we voted on Nov. 8 . On Monday , electors will get together to confirm that , yes , this is how our state voted . Then on Jan. 6 , we count up the Electoral College vote to make sure the math checks out . Why are we doing all this , exactly ?
Good question . In November 's vote , Trump won the Electoral College , as well as the majority of states and counties . But Hillary Clinton won the majority of votes -- by more than 2.8 million votes at last count . But even though the majority of Americans would prefer electing the president by popular vote , changing the system will be an uphill battle . Because the current setup is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution , a constitutional amendment would be required , which means two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives would have to back it -- along with 38 of the 50 states . And the current setup gives an advantage to less-populated states , one that they would be reluctant to give up .
`` If we went by popular vote , no small state in America would ever see a presidential candidate , '' said U.S. Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , the 2008 Republican presidential nominee . `` Our system is vital to making sure that all of America determines the next president , not just where the majority of the population is , which is both coasts . ''
In other words : You 'll be explaining this weird system to your foreign friends for the rest of your lives .

Donald Trump is a bully , and he 's used the tactic of bullying over the years to work deals in their favor , to not pay vendors , as well as to twist press coverage to their favor . Having lived in the NYC area for nearly 30 years , Trump 's antics have n't changed .
Trump has a dilemma . He 's in Washington DC now , and people there are used to much more sophisticated forms of bullying than their schoolyard antics . The president thought they could work their magic with James Comey when on May 12 , they tweeted the following :
James Comey better hope that there are no `` tapes '' of our conversations before they start leaking to the press ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 12 , 2017
The president may be a dolt , but he 's not stupid . They did n't definitively state there are recordings of their conversations , but they certainly suggested it . Naturally , their defenders are all asking , “ Did Trump say they had tapes ? ? ” It 's a convenient way to deflect attention away from what they did say .
Trump 's tweet is a perfect example of their propensity to retreat into self-aggrandizing behavior , thinking James Comey would shrink like a wilted flower at the very possibility tapes of their conversations existed . During Comey 's testimony , they threw water on Trump 's empty threat when Comey said they hoped there are tapes and had no problem with a public release of their contents .
So the question remains : Are there tapes or not ?
Jonathan Karl attempted to ask President Trump about the tapes , and the president gave a strange answer :
Why could n't they answer yes or no ? Because they likely knows he 's in hot water for even suggesting their conversations were recorded and threatening to release them . So President Trump will have to confer with their attorneys as to the best way to weasel out of their empty threat . Of course , for all of the fanboy talk of Trump being the tough guy alpha male , he 's going to hide behind their lawyers instead of just saying , “ There are no tapes . ”
The other possibility — and the one that has consequences far greater than being caught in a lie — is that there are tapes of the conversations and what those recordings will do is confirm Comey 's versions of events . Such a possibility is unlikely as Trump indicated to Karl , their answer on the tapes will be disappointing .
Why wait , Mr. President ? Put your cards on the table , sir .

Anyone who has navigated LA traffic knows the horror of ... the unprotected left turn .
Via Google images
You pull up to the intersection . You indicate left . And you wait . And wait . And then turn ... and hope you do n't get hit by oncoming traffic .
It 's such a point of dread , in fact , that the popular navigation app , Waze introduced a feature to minimize left turns on routes . So why is L.A. the land of the unprotected left turn ? For that , A Martinez spoke to Nathan Masters , host of KCET 's `` Lost LA . ''
Interview Highlights
Take us through the history of the left turn here in LA .
`` There really were no formal rules about left turns until the 1920s . In fact , it was n't until the 1920s that the state decided it wanted to start regulating how people , including bicyclists and pedestrians who used the roadway . When they started promulgating these rules they had to actually tell people , 'Hey , you need to signal your intention to make a left turn by sticking your arm out the window . ' That was back before we had left turn signals ... That was a big moment , when there were formal rules about how you can make a left turn and when you could make a left turn . The biggest changes actually came in the 1950s . That was when the city started installing what are called left turn pockets , which are places where you could wait to make a left turn before there 's a break in oncoming traffic . They also installed some of the first left turn signals which gave you a protected left turn . You know , exclusive use of the intersection to make a left turn for a short amount of time . In 1957 , there was a major change in the law of left turns . Prior to that if you were at the intersection first ... you have the right of way to make a left turn , even if there 's oncoming traffic as long as there 's no imminent threat that you 're going to be hit by somebody or hit somebody , you 're allowed to make a left turn . After that , you had to wait till there was a big break in traffic . ''
At first , L.A. motorists had trouble with the left-hand turn and the city tried to engineer it out of existence , what were some of the experimental things they tried ?
`` Well , there were a few practices that stand out . One of them was called 'darting ' ... I 've seen people practice it to this day . The light turns green and suddenly , you gun it ... The automobile club had to create a big public advocacy program to convince people to stop doing that . Drivers also would make left turns from the right lane , in the 1920s without any regard for what traffic might be coming up on your left and then other drivers would make a big grand 270-degree tour of the intersection , you know , a huge wide turn for no reason really . These were all big problems that the auto club and the city and police officers had to correct . ''
Orange County is L.A. 's not too far off neighbor and yet their streets look very different from ours . Why is that ?
`` One of the biggest differences is there are just a lot more protected left turn signals . A couple reasons for that : Left turn signals were n't introduced until the 1950s . Well , most of Orange County was built after the 1950s , including its transportation infrastructure . And then of course there 's also the fact that much of Orange County consists of these master plan communities and they were able to plan ahead , they were able to build roadways that would have the capacity to handle future growth .

Aka Emerald Green Cory , Green Cory , Emerald Green Cory Cat , Green Cory Cat , Emerald Green Cory Cats , Green Cory Cats , Iridescent Plated Catfish , Emerald Green Corydorus
Cory Cats are a popular addition to any tank for many aquarists . Cory Cats are a great asset as they are part of what is considered the clean up crew for fish tanks . The Emerald Green Corydorus is a beautiful addition to the tank with its stunning Emerald Green color . Depending on the light and the position your Cory is in , it can appear as Emerald Green or Metallic Blue .
The Emerald Green Cory Cat was found in shallow , oxygen rich rivers in the Amazon . They lived with muddy bottoms and heavily planted . They fed on worms , insect larvae , small crustaceans and occasionally some plants . Emeralds are schooling fish which means they need to be in groups of at least 3 . However , the more Cories you have in your fish tank , the happier they will be .
The Emerald Green Corydorus is a bottom dweller . This means the main stay at the bottom of the tank on the substrate . These impressive fish forge the bottom of the tank looking for food . This is how they are known as part of the clean up crew . They can be very shy fish , so hiding spots such as caves or live fish tank plants will be a requirement for these fish . Fully grown the average length of an Emerald Green Cory Cat is about 3 inches long . However , a larger female may grow up to about 3.5 inches in length .
Because the Emerald Green Corydorus is a schooling fish and you need at least 3 for them to thrive , a 20 gallon tank is a minimum recommended size tank for them . There are some dwarf cory cat species and they are perfect fish for 10 gallon fish tank . Cories are best kept with water conditions at :
pH 5.8-8.0
Hardness 2-15 dGH
Temperature 72-80 degrees F
Emerald Green Corydorus are very sensitive to any amounts of salt so it is best that they are in a tank that you do not add salt to .
Emerald Green Corydorus are a peaceful fish and should be kept with tank mates that are peaceful also . Because they are bottom dwellers they should pair up just fine with peaceful fish that are mid and top dwellers along with other species of Cories . Shrimp , crabs and snails may be endangered in the same fish tank as these Cories as they are part of the Cories diet .
In your aquarium , the Emerald Green Cory will eat flake food , but that should not be the only source of food for them . Sinking shrimp pellets is an ideal food along with flake food . So is blood worms and black worms .
Unfortunately , Emerald Green Cories is not one of the two known species of Cories that you can definitively sex . There are speculations that you can tell the difference between the males and females by their bellies . Some say that the males tend to have more of a yellow belly and the females may have more of a pink belly . Some also say that the female may be more broad and plump compared the males .
You may struggle to breed Emerald Green Cories for a few reasons . One reason is because they are hard to determine male from female . This means you may have 20 Emerald Green Cories before you can start the breeding process . The second reason is that Emerald Green Cories breed on weather conditions which many aquarists is unable to replicate in their home aquarium .
Unlike many other fish you may have in your aquarium that requires one male to a few females , Emerald Green Corydorus are different . You need 3 males to one female ratio in your fish tank . To get them ready to spawn you need to feed your Cories black worms and/or blood worms for several days to prepare them . After a few days you need to lower the water in the tank and add enough cold water to drop the temperature in your fish tank several degrees to imitate rain in the Amazon . You will notice when a male and a female pair up . The male will be a shadow to the female going everywhere that they go . Once the female is full of eggs , you will eventually notice them on the bottom of the fish tank in a T position or they will be laying side by side . The female will drop about 12 eggs and then adamantly bump around the males anal fin to get them to release sperm to fertilize the eggs . Once the eggs are fertilized , the female will gather up their eggs and deposit them one by one on my surfaces and objects in the aquarium . They will go back to the male and continue this process until they have laid all of their eggs which could very well be in the 1,000 's . In order for all of this to happen though , your Cories must be comfortable and happy in the tank . This means that you are not changing the décor around , they have a soft substrate , caves to hide in and live plants .
If you can successfully get your Emerald Green Cory Cats to lay eggs , do n't get too excited and start counting them before they hatch . Cory eggs are very prone to fungus which means that they will not hatch . If one egg gets fungus and is not removed it will spread to the other eggs and possibly destroying the entire batch . Once the eggs are laid , it is best to use an anit-fungus additive to the fish tank to help prevent the eggs getting fungus . Because your Cories are scaleless you need to pay close attention to what medications you are adding to your tank . Pimafix and Melafix are safe to add to your tank but medications with Permanganate or Copper based medications are not safe to add to your fish tank . You can leave the eggs in the fish tank if you would like , just be cautious of your Cories and the other fish in your aquarium . As long as your Emerald Green Corydorus are well fed , they usually pose no threat to the eggs . However , if you have a fish such as a Guppy fish that eats it 's own fry while giving birth , your Cory eggs may very well be in danger .
Emerald Green Cory eggs will hatch in about 3-5 days later . Initially your new baby Cories will feed on protozoan organisms . After a few days they will eat newly hatched baby brine shrimp or fry food . Once again , depending on the fish you have in your fish tank will depend on if the newly hatched Cories will be eaten or not . Hopefully you can be one of the aquarist with success breeding and hatching baby Cories .
Elijah Wood , the blue-eyed Frodo Baggins of The Lord of the Rings , has been wanting to visit India for a long time . The tunes of Bollywood songs of 1970s and 1980s , the culinary delights and Lata Mangeshkar 's voice were among the many reasons for their eagerness to come here . And the moment they got an opportunity , they ensured nothing came in the way .
In India on a three-city tour , he 's mesmerised with the desi version of their idea of Thailand 's 'tuk-tuks ' and was pleasantly surprised that the `` nightmarish '' traffic they had heard of , was n't `` quite the reality '' when they landed into Mumbai . More than that , he 's loving the hospitality .
`` People have been so friendly , accommodating and hospitable ... it has been lovely , '' said Elijah in a telephonic interview from Mumbai , where they performed on Thursday .
`` India is a place I always wanted to travel to . It is culturally and 'culinarily ' rich ... I 've always been fascinated by India as it 's one place in the planet that has such a singular identity .
`` The kind of rich history , incredible history of Bollywood ... so I jumped at the chance to come here when the opportunity came , '' said the 34-year-old , who is one half of the DJ duo Wooden Wisdom with Zach Cowie .
Getting a chance to entertain their Indian fans -- in Mumbai , Delhi and Hyderabad -- with music , was something Elijah was truly excited to do .
`` We have brought a lot of records that many people would n't have heard of here before . That 's exciting . We play a lot of soul , funk and international stuff from Africa and Turkey ... we actually brought some Bollywood soundtrack mix stuff too !
`` It 's honestly the best part of doing what we do -- to play music for people , travel to different countries , countries we have always wanted to travel to -- meet different people , and also experience their cultures and buy their records .
`` We are excited about shopping for records in India too , '' they said in their delightful voice , which they have lent to animated films like Happy Feet and Spyro .
They admit they have `` never seen an entire Bollywood film '' .
`` But I 've seen some of the song sequences ... my knowledge comes from soundtracks and some compilations , which have come out in the 1970s and 1980s ... old Bollywood numbers . I 've always loved Lata Mangeshkar ... their voice is lovely , '' they said .
While in India , they hope to take more rides of the auto-rickshaw , which they find an interesting version of Thailand 's 'tuk-tuks ' !
`` It seems that 's the only way to get around through the traffic , '' they quipped .
Overwhelming , is it ... the traffic in India , for him ?
`` It 's fine . We heard a lot about your ( country 's ) traffic , but we thought it was okay ... People said it could be nightmarish , but it was n't as bad as we were anticipating , '' they said .
Not sure about just what all they want to explore in the country , Elijah is happy to have a child-like excitement about being here .
`` Everything is so brand new to us , and so exciting .... it 's an entirely new experience for us . ''
Hopefully , a memorable one too !

The Bloomberg School 's Durbin recalls the buzz that materialized about 20 years ago over DNA vaccines , which promised the same advances as mRNA-based vaccines : quickly and cheaply made vaccines that triggered really good immune responses . But DNA vaccines did n't produce as good of an immunogenic response in humans as they did in mice during testing . And one of the main issues with DNA vaccines was ensuring that the DNA was delivered to the right spot inside the body .
`` We had a similar sense of excitement and possibility with DNA vaccines that have n't quite panned out the way we hoped , '' Durbin said . `` People will be very interested in these Zika vaccine results . ''

It remains to be seen whether mRNA-based vaccines , like the one Moderna is currently testing for Zika , can stand on their own . There are unresolved questions : How many doses of an mRNA-based vaccine will be needed to get a good immune response ? How long will that immune response last ?
And yet , Moderna is plunging ahead with its work on mRNA-based vaccines . Through its partnership with Merck , the company plans to develop personalized cancer vaccines . The Gates Foundation has pledged up to $ 100 million to develop mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases ; the first $ 20 million is being used by Moderna to develop mRNA-based antibody therapeutics to help prevent HIV infection .
Coming online in the middle of 2018 is a manufacturing facility in Norwood , Massachusetts . Bancel said it will be a factory capable of producing 1,200 products a year , where Moderna will make the mRNA required for a slew of vaccines . Scientists eager for testable mRNA will just have to enter , through an online automated system , the specific protein they want to direct a cell to make ; vials filled with mRNA will then get shipped .
`` My bet is that in the next five years , we 'll have two times as many drugs in the clinic than anybody else in the world , '' said Bancel . `` We 're just warming up now . ''

The cost of the city 's planned upgrades to the south end water pollution control centre is going up by $ 63 million .
A report going to Thursday 's finance committee states the project budgeted to cost the city $ 273 million is now likely going to cost upwards of $ 335.6 million .
According to the report by the city 's water and waste department , $ 37 million in additional funds will be needed to meet the more stringent licence requirements levied in 2012 by the province .
The other $ 26 million in added costs is the outcome of improved cost accuracy as the project moves along in development .
This number could still change , as the project 's design is only 30 % complete , the report states .
In 2011 , the plant came under fire after a malfunction led to partly-treated sewage being dumped into the Red River . The city was eventually sued by the province over the mishap .
The more stringent environmental requirements will also lead to a change of completion schedule , slated for October 2016 , according to the report .
Further funding from other levels of government still needs finalizing , but so far $ 42 million and $ 17 million has been committed by the provincial and federal government , respectively .
Those cost changes will head to the 2015 budget process for review .
Finance Chair Coun . Marty Morantz had not been briefed on the increase at press time and was not available for an interview .

If you like first-person shooters , you 'll love Sauerbraten . This open source game might not have the visual finesse of other FPSes , but what it lacks in the graphics department , Sauerbraten more than makes up for with its various single and multiplayer modes , including an experimental role-playing game mode , and a unique WYSIWYG in-game map editor . Sauerbraten blends the best of FPSes like Quake and Max Payne to give you a unique gaming experience .
This verdict is n't a surprise since Sauerbraten has a very good pedigree . It 's based on the redesigned Cube game engine developed by well-known Dutch programmer Wouter van Oortmerssen , who is a professor of software development and has written a few programming languages . The latest edition of Sauerbraten , which includes Capture The Flag gameplay and therefore called the CTF Edition , was released in June and runs on Linux , Windows , and Mac OS X .
It 's simple to get started with Sauerbraten on Linux . Just download the 301MB zipped archive , extract it under a directory such as /usr/local , and run the ./sauerbraten_unix script . The script automatically creates configuration files under ~/.sauerbraten that control various game characteristics such as screen resolution . You can also specify some options while running the sauerbraten_unix script , such as whether to launch the game in server mode . Some settings , such as mouse sensitivity , you can alter from within the game either by using a slider in the graphical setup menu or from the chat console .
Sauerbraten is similar to the venerable Quake series of games , both in terms of look and feel , and by being a user-modifiable game . Not only is it available under an open source license , it also allows you to edit maps on the fly in 3-D. To do so , launch the game as you do normally by selecting a map ( in this case the map you want to edit ) , and while it 's running , press `` E '' on your keyboard . This puts the game in edit mode , where you can edit the map by modifying octrees -- cubes made up of eight smaller cubes . In edit mode you move around the map as you would in a normal game , selecting and modifying octrees with your mouse , placing and moving entities like ammo boxes , armor , and even monsters , and defining particle behavior for elements like smoke , water , and weapon fire . It might take some getting used to , but once you get the hang of it , creating and editing levels is as addictive as playing the game itself .
Single player gameplay
Many first-person shooters focus on multiplayer environmentsm , but Sauerbraten offers several interesting single-player gaming modes as well . In the traditional stage-based mode , you start as Private Stan Sauer , make your way to the big valley , fight hordes of invading monsters as a one-man army , and conquer the four bases . The objective in these stages , as in any FPS , is to run around the maps back and forth , grabbing keys , opening doors , dodging fireballs , and staying alive in the kill-or-be-killed environment .
Then there are deathmatches which are you-vs-them handicap contests . You are put in a map with monsters and the only objective is to kill all the monsters , in the fastest time possible with the least number of respawns .
To assist you with the bloodshed , your John McClane-like character in an Ellen Ripley-type environment has access to a full arsenal of weapons that includes a handgun , shotgun , rifle , and machine gun , as well as the FPS favorites rocket launcher , grenade launcher , and chainsaw .
The monsters in Sauerbraten lack the intelligence of their cousins in other modern FPSes . They block each other , keep running into walls , and some back off and stop firing if you run back out of the room , or retreat some distance . You score off each hit depending on the distance between you and the monster and the size of monster , with high points for the really big and nasty ones that can survive multiple rocket attacks . You can respawn infinitely , but each respawn costs you points and the monsters steal some of your ammo and armor .
There are 11 single-player maps plus three demos that teach you basic Sauerbraten skills such as opening doors and jumping . The maps do n't list their level of difficulty , and some maps have a more complex layout than others , but all involve a fair amount of going back and forth . You can play a deathmatch in any of the 60-plus maps .
To add to the fun , Sauerbraten also has slow-motion variants of both the stage-based and deathmatch gaming modes . In the slow-motion variant of the game , your health controls the speed of the game -- the closer to death you are , the slower the game . If you 've played Max Payne , you 'll know what I 'm talking about , since it is n't unlike Max Payne 's famous bullet-time .
It 's fun to run through a corridor , jumping just before the door on the left , twisting in mid-air , and firing your handgun at unsuspecting monsters . To do it in slow motion is almost cinematic . For more fun , you can switch from the default first person view to third person . There 's no difference in gameplay , but fans of third-person shooters like Tomb Raider will enjoy the ability to change perspective .
To give its players more gaming options , Sauerbraten developers are working on building a role-playing component into the game as well . It 's called Eisenstern , and it includes four maps . To start a RPG game you need to lauch Sauerbraten with the -grpg option . Like any other RPG , you have to move forward by buying and selling stuff , and doing `` jobs '' for others , such as kiling wolves with a chainsaw for an apple .
Multiplayer gameplay
If you are tired of battling computer-controlled drones , you can run Sauerbraten as a server and host a multiplayer game on your LAN , or join a multiplayer game online via the Internet . There are more than a dozen multiplayer game modes , including deathmatch , instagib ( classic 1-shot-1-kill ) , efficiency ( spawn with random ammunition ) , insta arena ( last man standing ) , tactics ( efficiency-based last man standing ) , capture ( keep bases under your control for as long as possible ) , capture the flag , and instacapture ( capture with instagib ) . Most of these are available in team play variants for which you can choose to play on either the good or evil team .
You can browse all the ongoing Internet and LAN games from within the game and join any one . On a 512Kbps connection I did n't notice any lag or delays in any Internet multiplayer game . But thanks to my poor FPS skills , I usually lasted only 20-30 seconds before I was fragged , especially since I decided to stay at the base and guard my team 's flag .
If you are hooked on editing maps , Sauerbraten also allows you to do so by collaborating with others . In the list of multiplayer gaming modes , you 'll find a few games where various users collaborate with each other to design maps . Most of them are locked to public users , and for good reason , since you can virtually destroy someone 's castle in a matter of minutes .
In summary
Sauerbraten is a fully loaded first-person shooter . It has single-player modes with interesting motion delay , several multiplayer gaming modes , and enough maps to keep you involved for as long as you wish to play . You can host your own Sauerbraten server on your LAN or join one of the dozens of online servers .
But if you have to point to the one thing that separates Saurberaten from the rest , it has to be its in-game 3-D map editor . You can also take your map-building expertise online , and work with map editors from around the world in an online collaborative environment .
It might not be visually stunning like some of its competitors , but Sauerbraten is unlike any other FPS that I 've ever played .

TEL AVIV ( Reuters ) - SpaceIL , a nonprofit organization aiming to land the first Israeli spacecraft on the moon , said on Wednesday it has received a $ 16.4 million grant from the foundation of U.S. casino magnate Sheldon Adelson .
With a budget estimated at $ 36 million , the Israeli scientists and engineers building the shuttle - temporarily named “ Sparrow ” - believe it will land on the moon by the end of 2015 , a feat only the United States , Russia and China have managed so far .
SpaceIL , which is backed mainly by philanthropists , was founded to compete for Google 's LunarX Prize , unveiled in 2007 . The $ 20 million prize will go to the first team to land a spacecraft on the moon , make it jump 500 meters and transmit images and video back to earth .
Thirty-three teams started out in the running and they are now down to 18 , including competitors from the United States , Italy , Japan , Germany , Brazil , Canada , India and Chile .
SpaceIL said it aims to show that space exploration is no longer limited to global superpowers with vast space programmes . It also hopes its technological breakthroughs spur a new wave of commercial space-related industries in Israel .
“ As an entrepreneur , nothing is as thrilling as supporting a group of people who have been told that their dreams can not be realized , ” Adelson said .

Put down your pokemans for just one god damn second and do something fun for a change like participate in the epistolary tradition !
That 's right . You can write us letters through a vast computer network and then we 'll read them and even answer them right here on this website . And maybe , just maybe , we 'll make IDW print them in an upcoming issue of Atomic Robo and the Temple of Od !
Of course our Patrons get first dibs on all this stuff , but their dibs are up as of this exact moment . Now it 's your chance to get on this action . Just email us at asktesladyne @ gmail.com with your comments or questions or whatever . If it relates to Atomic Robo , or making comics in general , or trying to pay the bills by doing that , or science , or history , so much the better . But that 's not a requirement !
Police in Osterund in the North of Sweden have warned women not to walk unaccompanied after dark in the city following nine violent attacks in less than three weeks .
Local police chief Stephen Jerand said in a televised statement they felt the warning was justified in the wake of reports of the latest attack on a woman on Tuesday ( 2 March ) in the town of 45,000 .
`` It is always a consideration whether to go out with this kind of thing or not . But we do n't want to sit here for another week and have more crime victims on our desk , '' they were quoted by the Telegraph as saying .
Jerand said a man had jumped out of their car at 4.30am on Saturday ( 27 February ) threatening to rape and stab one woman . `` It 's not a normal picture that we 're seeing , '' the police chief commented on the rise in attacks .
In January , police in Sweden were accused of covering up sexual assaults by asylum seekers at a music festival for political reasons . At events held for teenagers in August 2015 and 2014 , police received reports of groups of Afghan men sexually harassing girls .
The news followed mass sexual assaults in Cologne , Germany on New Year 's Eve which fuelled a tide of anti-migrant and refugee sentiment .
In Osterund , the city 's mayor , Ann-Sofie Andersson , said they had not been consulted on the warning before it was issued .
`` The solution can never be to not go out because of such a warning . We have very many women who work in home and social care at night for example . What are they supposed to do ? '' they told the Swedish state broadcaster SVT .
The warning has also been met with derision in Sweden . TV criminologist Leif GW Persson called the decision by Osterund 's police `` unusually stupid '' .
Niklas Stoepel is the only competitive male in synchronized swimming in Germany . The 17-year-old high school student from the western German town of Wattenscheid continues to battle an unusual form of gender discrimination and prejudice in their push to compete at the international level .
So far , though , their applications to compete have been rejected by the international swimming federation FINA , and their prospects for going to the Olympics remain limited at best . In Germany , where the German Swimming Association is a bit more tolerant of men in the sport , Stoepel has already become national youth champion with their FS Bochum team in group competition .
SPIEGEL recently caught up with Stoepel to ask them about their battle for fair treatment and what it 's like to be the only guy on their swim team .
SPIEGEL : You 're the only male synchronized swimmer in Germany . With your teammates at FS Bochum , you became the top German team . But now you 're not being allowed to swim with the German national team in international competitions . Why not ?
Stoepel : The German Swimming Association applied to the international swimming association FINA two years ago to let me compete . But FINA rejected the request . I believe that officials just do n't want to see any men in this sport .
SPIEGEL : Why do you think that ?
Stoepel : You can already sense that at the national level . Many of the judges are stricter in their scoring of me than they are with my female competitors . It 's not fair . But I have n't given up my dream of one day competing in an international championship .
SPIEGEL : You swim with sequins on your bathing suit and you have to shave your legs before competing . How do your fellow classmates react to your unusual passion ?
Stoepel : Even I am surprised by how relaxed people are about it . I have been swimming in a girl 's group for almost 10 years , and so far I have only had one experience where someone laughed at me . Someone at a party was making fun of this guy who swims with a bunch of girls . They said that in front of me , not realizing that I was that boy . The others all laughed , and I think it was more embarrassing for them than it was for me .
Today marks our one-year wandering-anniversary . One year ago exactly , us , our new home on wheels , and all our possessions drove down the driveway of the house that we no longer owned for the last time . One year ago today I published our first blog post , and one year ago today our journey began .
We 've learned a few things in the past year . For one , we love this wandering lifestyle , and for two , after one year we still have so much more to see ! So in the spirit of our continuing journey , on this one-year anniversary instead of simply looking back on the favorite places that we have visited , we look back instead on the places we have visited , and want to return . In essence , this post is both a tribute to the past and the future . Here 's to many , many more years of wandering !
Lake Michigan & the Upper Peninsula
To say that Michigan was a surprise would be an understatement . When we originally planned our route up Michigan , through the Upper Peninsula , and then west into Wisconsin , we simply thought it would be more interesting than traveling farther south through Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois . We were right . It was more interesting- in fact , it was fantastic . After a fun Fourth of July visit with some family outside of Detroit , we headed west to the shores of Lake Michigan . As this is one of the famed Great Lakes , I am sure it is well known just how gorgeous this stretch of shoreline is . For some reason , it was not well known to us . The moment when the first glimpse of the white sandy beach and clear , turquoise water came into view , we knew we were in for a treat . We made two stops on the western shores of Lake Michigan . First at the Claybanks County Park , and then at the Sleeping Bear National Seashore . But we were n't done with this lake yet . Next , we headed north into Michigan 's famed Upper Peninsula where we enjoyed the north shore of Lake Michigan from two more stops , Brevort Lake and Little Bay De Noc . We spent two weeks in Michigan and could have easily stayed two more months . High on our list for next time are some of the state parks on the western shore that we missed out on because we lacked reservations and the north side of the Upper Peninsula along Lake Superior .
Northern Minnesota
This was another hidden gem that we discovered in the middle of the country . And another place that we spent far to little time exploring . There 's an area in north-east Minnesota along the shores of Lake Superior called the North Shore . This pristine stretch of lakeside boasts some of the nicest , most well run and picturesque state parks we 've ever visited ( a tie with Oregon state parks- but we 'll get to those later ) . Despite our lack of reservations , we managed to get spots at both Gooseberry Falls and Temperance River . We would stay at either of those campgrounds again in an instant , but more than anything , when we return to Minnesota we want to spend time exploring the remote section of the northern interior of the state that is teeming with lakes and forests . After all , Minnesota is called the “ Land of 1o,000 Lakes ” - and we only saw one . I guess that means we have 9,999 to go .
Black Hills , South Dakota
Our visit to the Black Hills was very short- only one night . We wanted to stay longer , but because of a lack of planning on our part , we arrived the weekend before the huge Sturgis Motorcycle Rally . When I say huge , I mean around 400,000 attendees and their motorcycles . While we were able to find a camping spot at the very nice Bismarck National Forest campground , it was just too busy for us to really explore the area . We also felt a bit out of place without our leather vests , bandannas , and tall black boots . Our travel route this year brings us back to the Black Hills for the first week of August . Ironically , our visit is only one week prior to when we visited last year . Which means we may see a few early attendees at the bike rally . We 're not too worried about it though because we 'll be leaving on the day we arrived last year . Also , we already have a reservation for the entire week on the shores of Lake Sheridan , between Rapid City and Custer . We ca n't wait !
Grand Teton National Park
We spent a week in the area around the Grand Tetons last August and it was awesome . We got to experience soaring mountains , clear blue lakes , and a little wildlife sitings . Unfortunately , there was a ton of smoke in the air from nearby wildfires . We explored a few different areas in and around the Grand Teton National Park , including an isolated campground called Turpin Meadow in the Teton wilderness , Signal Mountain Campground inside the park , and an awesome free camping spot between the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone . The lack of Internet service in and around the park cut our stay short , and we would love to go back and explore more of the hiking trails , lakes , and gorgeous mountains vistas- preferably without a layer of smoky haze in the air .
Glacier National Park
Like our visit to the Grand Tetons , our journey through Montana was marred by lingering smoke from the continuous wildfires . As we headed north through the state the smoke dissipated somewhat , but our visit to Glacier National Park was definitely dampened by the smoke . That 's not to say we did n't enjoy ourselves immensely . We stayed at two campgrounds in Glacier , Avalanche , and Apgar . We went on a few extraordinary hikes , two awe-inspiring drives , and spent some quality time with the dog alongside lovely Lake McDonald . Besides returning to explore more of the park , we would really like to visit when the air is not filled with smoke . Hopefully , our wish will come true . We already have plans to return to Glacier and spend the first week of September there . Let 's hope for the sake of all us visitors , as well as those who live in the area , that Montana and Wyoming will be wildfire free this summer .
Idaho
Idaho is a big state , and we only saw a tiny portion of it . Our intended route took us from northern Montana , across the skinny part of northern Idaho , and into Washington . We spent one long weekend at the Schwietzer Mountain Resort enjoying their Fall Festival . There was beer , music , hiking and free camping . It was a blast . Unfortunately , that is all we saw of Idaho . And we know there is so much more . So Idaho makes the list as a place we loved , but did n't spend nearly enough time .
Oregon Coast
Last fall we spent six weeks traveling down the Oregon coast . I challenge anybody to visit the Oregon coast and not fall in love . Unless you are some kind of weirdo who hates the thought of pristine ocean beaches , lighthouses , quaint fishing towns , hikes on bluffs , and stellar state parks- it is not possible . I promise . This is a place we are sure to return…again and again and again . We stayed at far too many different places for me to list them all with links to the blog posts . Instead , I invite you to visit the Oregon Tab where you can scroll though all the posts from our six weeks . Or head over to the map on our Where page and click on Oregon to see all the stops and corresponding blog posts on the coast .
Lake Mead
Lake Mead was the site of our first extended boondocking experience . For ten days we lived within steps of the most gorgeous blue lake in the middle of a hiker paradise– all for free . Despite our extended stay we simply could n't fit it all in . A return trip to Lake Mead is definitely in our future . Next time around we hope to conquer more hikes , take a trip to the nearby Valley of Fire State Park , and maybe even explore the lake in the kayak that we hope to acquire sometime down the road .
Arizona Desert
We spent quite a bit of time in Arizona this past winter , fifty-four days to be exact . It still was n't enough time to enjoy it all . What we thought was going to be a barren , flat , hot desert filled with nothing but retirees and prickly cacti , turned out to be a surprisingly beautiful and varied landscape with vibrant cities , funky small towns , and some really cool new folks to meet along the way . Our first stop in Arizona was the tiny town of Ajo where we first fell in love with the giant saguaro cactus , and had a blast hanging out with some fellow RVers . Then we moved onto two different parks in Tucson , Gilbert Ray and Catalina State Park . Next , it was up to Phoenix for two more campgrounds , Lost Dutchman State Park and Usery Regional Park . Finally , we ended our Arizona adventure with some boondocking in Sedona . While we would n't hesitate to make a return visit to any of these places , what we really look forward to is exploring the parts of the Arizona desert that we did n't see . Specifically , a bit farther south in the areas around Patagonia State Park , Bisbee , Tombstone and also east to the Chiricachua National Monument . Right now it 's looking more and more likely that we may end up spending next winter in the southwest again . If that 's the case , then all those places and probably a few more will be on the agenda .
Southern Utah
Much like our time in Arizona , while we spent a long time in Utah- 46 days- it was n't enough . We traveled through a good portion of the southern half of the state . Starting on the southern shores of Lake Powell , onto Zion National Park , and then heading north to Moab where we explored Arches National Park and stayed at a fun BLM campground amid the famous Utah slickrock . From there we went south to the four-corners area where we discovered ancient ruins , amazing rock formations and river valleys . Despite this lengthy journey , we missed the entire middle section of southern Utah . Next time we plant to visit Bryce Canyon , Capital Reef , the Grand Staircase Escalante area and more of Glen Canyon .
Here are ABC 's renew/cancel standings for week 6 of the 2017-18 season , wherein the network 's worst time period strikes again .
Show Status 18-49 rating Renew/Cancel Index The Middle Final season 1.36 0.66 Scandal ( O ) Final season 1.18 0.48 Ten Days in the Valley DSW 0.43 -0.27 Kevin ( Probably ) Saves the World ( O ) 🐻 🐻 0.78 0.08 Once Upon a Time ( F ) ( O ) 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.58 0.13 Inhumans ( F ) ( O ) 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.6 0.16 The Mayor ( O ) 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.90 0.20 Fresh Off the Boat 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.12 0.42 How to Get Away with Murder ( O ) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.93 0.23 Designated Survivor ( O ) 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.85 0.15 Speechless 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.17 0.47 Black-ish ( O ) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.2 0.5 American Housewife ( O ) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.38 0.68 The Good Doctor 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 2.02 1.32 Grey 's Anatomy ( O ) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 2.02 1.32 The Goldbergs Renewed 1.52 0.82 Modern Family Renewed 1.78 1.08
How do you undo the damage created in your network 's worst timeslot ? It 's a complex question .
But here 's one way not to go about it : putting a niche show that 's part drama and part comedy and not terribly easy to sell in said timeslot . You do n't have to be a TV wonk , or a Bear , to have guessed that “ Kevin ( Probably ) Saves the World ” would have a tough go in ABC 's black hole of 10 p.m. Tuesdays .
And so it has . “ Kevin ” is barely above replacement level , and has the lowest Renewal/Cancel Index number on ABC outside of Dead Show Walking “ Ten Days in the Valley. ” It 's likely to play out its full order , but it 's also likely be canceled .
Key :
DSW Dead Show Walking : All but officially canceled yet still airing 🐻 sure bet to be canceled by May 2018 🐻 🐻 likely to be canceled by May 2018 🐻 🐻 🐻 tossup between renewal and cancellation by May 2018 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 likely to be renewed by May 2018 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 sure bet to be renewed by May 2018
The Renewal/Cancel Index is the amount above ( or below ) a replacement-level rating — i.e. , the expected adults 18-49 rating of an emergency fill-in show should a series be canceled . For the 2016-17 season , replacement level is a 0.7 same-day rating in adults 18-49 for the Big 4 networks and a 0.2 for The CW . ( Read more here . ) The index number is taken by subtracting 0.7 ( or 0.2 ) from a show 's average same-day rating .
Friday scripted shows ( denoted with an “ F ” above ) on the Big 4 have average ratings about 30 percent lower than those of other nights , therefore their ratings are multiplied by 1.43 ( 1/0.7 , or 70 percent ) before subtracting the replacement-level number .
Shows that have ended their seasons have their R/C Index number frozen at the point of their final episode .
( O ) – Owned : All other things equal , shows owned by studios affiliated with their networks have a better shot at renewal than those from outside producers .

They have been barred do to a a character problem - they have n't paid on their 400,000 in student loan debt . Much of it accumulated in late fees and interest tacked through the years . The holder of their loans is Sallie Mae .
For those of you who have not been in this situation , if you are unable to pay your loans due to illness , there is no classification for this . You can get a financial hardship forbearance for a time , but it will run out and your interest will be capitalized . If you have a long term illness there is no bankruptcy option , that loan will likely remain with you until you die .
There just last year was a new program started that will let workers in public service have their loans forgiven in 10 years , as long as payments are made continually . The rest of us have that option in 25 or so . The government also has a new income adjusted payment plan that does n't eat you alive in interest if you transfer your loans to them and can make the payments . It is the first of it 's kind - ever . Student loans can be used as an excuse to garnish wages , take money from tax returns , even come out of your retirement . No forgiveness or bankruptcy option on them . This is the first plan that I have ever heard of .
I graduated in 1992 myself with 16,000 in debt , under Sallie Mae . Unable to find more than minimum wage work immediately , and facing illnesses myself , that amount is now almost 40,000 , despite my meager attempts at payment over the years .
Now here is this man who has gotten through law school and they are preventing them from doing the very thing that could allow them to move forward and clear these debts ? This is outrageous . Here is what they said :
But a group of five state appellate judges decided this spring that their student loans were too big and their efforts to repay them too meager for them to be a lawyer . “ Applicant has not made any substantial payments on the loans , ” the judges wrote in a terse decision and an unusual rejection of the committee 's recommendation . “ Applicant has not presently established the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law . ”

WASHINGTON -- Redskins defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth allegedly slid their credit card into the bra of a waiter and then touched their breast , according to court papers filed Wednesday offering Haynesworth a plea deal in the sexual abuse case .
Haynesworth 's lawyer , however , said the deal was not one he 'd take and that their client would fight the charge . Prosecutors filed paperwork in Superior Court in Washington saying that if Haynesworth agrees to plead guilty to simple assault they would drop the misdemeanor sexual abuse charge . Both charges carry the same maximum penalty , however , up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $ 1,000 .
Haynesworth 's attorney , A. Scott Bolden , wrote in an e-mail Wednesday to The Associated Press that the offer was `` no deal at all , nor is it one we would entertain . ''
`` My client is prepared to , and will vigorously fight these charges , '' they wrote .
It is typical for prosecutors to offer a plea deal at the start of misdemeanor proceedings and share details of their case at that time .
An overview of the government 's case , filed with the plea offer in court documents , includes a fuller description of the alleged incident at The W Hotel in Washington in mid-February . The eight-page document stated Haynesworth was attending a birthday party the night of Feb. 12-13 and was ready to pay the bill of more than $ 800 when their waiter was called over with their hands full of dishes .
Insisting they wanted to pay immediately and before they could drop off the dishes , Haynesworth tapped the woman on their arm and shoulder with their card , according to the court papers . The waiter `` looked up and down at herself , as if wondering where [ Haynesworth ] expected them to put [ the card ] , '' when they slid the card down the center of their bra and began touching their breast , the documents allege . They said something to the effect of `` Can I do that ? , '' the documents state .
One witness who saw the exchange believed the waiter had agreed to let Haynesworth place the card in their bra , but reported their tone turned stern and they asked them to remove their hand after they touched her , according to the documents . The card was ultimately declined , and another waiter took it back to Haynesworth , prosecutors say in the document .
After the waiter told other employees what had happened , a security person at the hotel approached Haynesworth and asked them whether they remembered having any contact with the woman .
`` I did n't touch her , '' Haynesworth responded , according to the document , adding that they do n't `` even like black girls . ''
When police detectives later tried to interview Haynesworth , they spontaneously told them , according to court papers : `` I know what this is about , they are just upset I have a white girlfriend . I could n't tell you the last time I dated a black girl . They were trying to get with me . ''
They refused to be interviewed further but did later provide a sworn statement to the government .
Haynesworth had a tumultuous 2010 season with the Redskins that ended when they were suspended without pay for the final four games of the season for `` conduct detrimental to the club . '' They have constantly feuded with coach Mike Shanahan , skipped offseason workouts and failed to pass a conditioning test at the start of training camp . They did not start a game last season , despite being in the second year of a seven-year , $ 100 million contract .
Asked on Wednesday what they think of the sexual abuse charge , Redskins coach Mike Shanahan said it would not be fair for them to give their opinion without talking to Haynesworth .
`` Any time that somebody 's name that 's out there that 's associated with this organization that 's not positive , obviously you do n't feel very good about it , '' Shanahan said . `` But you want to get the facts first , and I have n't been able to talk to Albert . Therefore I do n't feel comfortable talking about it . ''
Haynesworth has until May 17 to decide whether to accept the plea offer .
Haynesworth is also currently facing charges in Virginia for allegedly punching a man during a road-rage assault . That trial is scheduled for May . At one point last summer , they were also involved in lawsuits from a bank , an exotic dancer , a man injured in an automobile accident and complaints from their ex-wife that they are n't paying for their health insurance or their children 's bills .

Spoiler alert : This post contains spoilers from the March 10 series finale of The Vampire Diaries .
For years , die-hard Vampire Diaries fans have wondered how the show would end , or , more specifically , what ending Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson came up with during season 2 . Sitting in a mall food court , the co-creators of the show found what they thought was a perfect ending , but that 's not what fans watched on Friday , March 10 . As Williamson told EW , “ The big finale episode that we had always planned did not happen because the show was successful and lasted eight years . ”
As a refresher , the series finale that aired featured Stefan sacrificing themselves to save everyone , and therefore finding peace . It left Bonnie to travel the world , Matt to run for mayor of Mystic Falls , and Caroline and Ric to open a boarding school for their girls and other “ gifted ” children like them . As for Damon and Elena , they lived a happy human life before , in the show 's final moments , they each found peace when Elena was reunited with their deceased parents and Damon got one final brother hug from Stefan .
RELATED : Vampire Diaries bosses on the series finale , that letter , and who almost died
And while Plec has always said that the sentiment remained the same from the ending they first came up with all those years ago , what exactly was that original ending ? Plec says : “ Back in season 2 when Kevin and I were sitting in the mall and we had fallen in love with this series and this story about two brothers who loved the same girl and the love triangle was kicking into high gear , we said to ourselves : When all is said and done , when this show is over , both brothers should die in the name of saving their girl and then be watching them like ghosts — because we had introduced the Other Side — as they went off into the sunset to live their life and maybe marry Matt Donovan or maybe become a doctor , but that those brothers would be side-by-side watching them live . That was the thing that made us cry all the tears in season 2 . ”
But as Plec points out , the show lost its love triangle when Nina Dobrev left at the end of season 6 . “ I felt like we had to make a commitment to seeing Damon and Elena through to the end , ” Plec says . “ If Nina had never left , I would 've loved to have been able to see if Stefan and Elena could 've found their way back to each other . I do n't know if they could have , but had that departure not been a part of it , the long game would 've been to see if we could bring the love triangle back around before the series ended and really leave a choice . But their departure sealed the romantic contract between Damon and Elena . In that moment , to me , the show ceased to be about a love triangle and became a show about the power of these brothers and their love for each other . And so there was no way in hell I was killing both of them and leaving neither of them with the happy ending . It just was never going to happen . ”
So instead , one brother got to be the hero and another got a happy human life , but more importantly , they both found redemption , and ultimately , peace .
Let me recommend two sharp opening variations for the black pieces : the Sicilian Najdorf and Semi-Slav Botvinnik variation . They lead to dynamic and complicated positions with chances for both sides . They are excellent for playing for a win with the black pieces . To master one or both of these variations , I recommend getting at least one modern book per variation and study these in great detail . Also , check all grandmaster games you can find and explore the ideas for both sides in these positions .
The starting position of the Sicilian Najdorf is reached after
[ FEN `` '' ] 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6
Let 's try to understand this position . Black has a statically better position thanks to the semi-open c-file . This means that an exchange of queens in this position is beneficial for black . White will fight for the d5 square and try to plant a light piece there . Black will try to deliver the d6-d5 center blow , thematic for the Sicilian system . White castles queenside in the sharpest Najdorf variations . Black castles kingside , queenside or stays with the King in the center , depending on the situation . Black chooses between the setups e7-e6 , e7-e5 and g7-g6 . White chooses between f2-f3 and f2-f4 .
When white castles queenside , black attacks with the b- and a-pawns as well as the thematic exchange sac Rc8xNc3 bxc3 , ruining the queenside pawn structure . If this exchange sac can be followed by picking up the e4-pawn , then it can be done at virtually any moment . Another thematic plan for black is placing a knight on e5 ( after white 's f-pawn is either on f5 or exchanged off ) or c4 ( attacking the b2-pawn and undermining the c3-knight ) .
The starting position of the Semi-Slav Botvinnik is reached after
[ FEN `` '' ] 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.Bg5 dxc4 6.e4 b5
At first glance , black just grabbed the c4-pawn and is trying to hold on to it for dear life . Yet things are more subtle than this . Black has entered an assymetric position where white has to find dynamic plans to compensate for the material loss . It also looks like white is winning with e4-e5 . Yet again , things are not so simple at all . A bit deeper we reach the following position
[ FEN `` '' ] 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.Bg5 dxc4 6.e4 b5 7.e5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Nxg5 hxg5 10.Bxg5 Nbd7 11.exf6
White will try to win using the extra kingside pawns . White can also launch an attack on the black King . Black will try to win by launching an attack on the white King , after developing with Bc8-b7 , Qd8-b6 and O-O-O . White will most probably castle kingside , since staying in the center or castling queenside looks spooky . Black will open the a8-h1 diagonal and attack the isolated d4-pawn . I have used both these variations with joy and success . They are simply awesome !
At least one Canadian telecom is evidently giving the government unrestricted access to communications on its network , according to documents from Canada 's privacy commissioner .
The documents , obtained by University of Ottawa digital law professor Michael Geist , cite an unnamed telecom firm as saying it had allowed the government to essentially copy the communication data moving on its networks .
`` Interception of communications over data networks is accomplished by sending what is essentially a mirror image of the packet data as it transits the network of data nodes , ” the privacy commissioner 's document states .
“ This packet data is then sent directly to the agency who has obtained lawful access to the information . Deep packet inspection is then performed by the law enforcement agency for their purposes . ”
“ Deep packet inspection ” is a method of analyzing internet traffic to determine the exact type of content . It can distinguish between emails , file-sharing and other types of internet communication , and can be used to build statistics about an internet user .
The statement appears in a document prepared by law firm Gowling Lafleur Henderson for the privacy commissioner . It summarizes nine telecom firms ' responses to questions about law enforcement access posed by the commissioner . The document can be found starting on page 42 here .
Geist called it “ an incredible admission ” in a blog post published Thursday .
“ Are there legal grounds for these disclosures ? Who is doing this ? ” Geist asked . “ Given the uncertainty and the enormous privacy implications , the Privacy Commissioner of Canada is surely entitled to investigate this admission using their current powers… . ”
In documents released Tuesday , interim federal privacy commissioner Chantal Bernier revealed that the government made about 1.2 million requests for subscriber data from Canadian telecoms in 2011 . Geist calculates that works out to one request every 27 seconds . Telecom firms complied with the requests at least 784,000 times , the privacy commissioner 's report showed .
NDP Leader Tom Mulcair attacked the government in question period Wednesday , calling the amount of requests “ an abomination . ”
Prime Minister Stephen Harper suggested that questions regarding data requests should be forwarded to law enforcement agencies .
`` Various Canadian investigative , law enforcement and other agencies will from time to time request information from telecom companies , '' Harper said Wednesday . `` They always do this , Mr. Speaker , in accordance with the law . They always seek a warrant when they are required to do so . ''
However , under Canada 's PIPEDA law , telecoms are not always “ required to do so ” and Geist and others estimate a majority of the data requests were warrantless .
According to documents provided to NDP MP Charmaine Borg earlier this year , the Canada Border Services Agency alone made 18,849 data requests in a recent 12-month period . Of those , only 52 requests had court warrants .
The documents also show that some telecoms are building subscriber databases that law enforcement can access at will . In one document , the Competition Bureau declares it had accessed “ the Bell Canada Law Enforcement database ” 20 times in a one-year period .
“ The systems may create great efficiencies for law enforcement - click , access subscriber data , and receive a bill from the telecom company - but they suggest a system that is entirely devoid of oversight , with even the Privacy Commissioner excluded from ensuring compliance with the law , ” Geist wrote .

HARTFORD , Conn ( Reuters ) - Connecticut took a major step toward becoming the 49th state to allow Sunday alcohol sales when the Senate voted on Tuesday to allow liquor stores to sell beer , wine and spirits any day of the week .
Governor Dannel Malloy pledged to sign the bill that passed the Senate on a 28-6 vote following similar approval by the House . They said such sales would help Connecticut hang onto dollars that had been flowing on Sundays to neighboring Rhode Island , Massachusetts and New York .
Malloy 's signature will leave Indiana as the only state in the country to ban all alcohol sales on Sunday , said Frank Coleman , spokesperson for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States .
“ Our current laws have cost Connecticut businesses millions of dollars as consumers have flocked over our borders in search of more convenient hours and lower prices , ” Malloy said in a statement .
I love Zappos . For a company built on treating their customers right , even they go above and beyond the call of duty . Let me tell you about my experience .
Last week I ordered a couple of pairs of new shoes in advance of the Labor Day weekend . I ordered them on Monday , hoping that I would have them by the time the weekend rolled around and I was leaving NYC for the weekend .
That afternoon , I received a surprise email . Here 's what I saw :
I was happy .
Then I received notice that Tuesday morning that my shoes had shipped and that they would be delivered by 3pm ! Under 24 hours free shipping ? Perfect .
I tweeted about it :
Then , things got awesome .
I received this tweet back :
No big deal , I thought to myself . So I tweeted back :
Next thing I know , I receive this tweet :
Check my email ? What ? I checked my email and lo and behold this is what I saw :
Sweet ! So I tweeted back :
And then received :
My response ?
And their final reply :
That 's not all !
Yesterday , I arrived at work to see a package laying on my desk . Here 's what it was :
That 's right , not only did Zappos get me my stuff in under 24 hours and upgrade me to VIP for free , they also a week later sent me a free copy of Tony Hsieh 's book to read . I had been planning to order it that day as well !
Thanks Zappos . You guys do social media and customer service right .

Kate Courteau is the architect who designed Y Combinator 's office . Recently we managed to recruit them to help us run YC when she 's not busy with architectural projects . Though she 'd heard a lot about YC since the beginning , the last 9 months have been a total immersion .
I 've been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal to me , so I was curious to hear what had surprised them most about it . This was their list :
1 . How many startups fail . Kate knew in principle that startups were very risky , but they were surprised to see how constant the threat of failure was—not just for the minnows , but even for the famous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners .
2 . How much startups ' ideas change . As usual , by Demo Day about half the startups were doing something significantly different than they started with . We encourage that . Starting a startup is like science in that you have to follow the truth wherever it leads . In the rest of the world , people do n't start things till they 're sure what they want to do , and once started they tend continue on their initial path even if it 's mistaken .
3 . How little money it can take to start a startup . In Kate 's world , everything is still physical and expensive . You can barely renovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup .
4 . How scrappy founders are . That was their actual word . I agree with her , but till they mentioned this it never occurred to me how little this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world . It would n't be a compliment in most organizations to call someone scrappy .
What does it mean , exactly ? It 's basically the diminutive form of belligerent . Someone who 's scrappy manages to be both threatening and undignified at the same time . Which seems to me exactly what one would want to be , in any kind of work . If you 're not threatening , you 're probably not doing anything new , and dignity is merely a sort of plaque .
5 . How tech-saturated Silicon Valley is . `` It seems like everybody here is in the industry . '' That is n't literally true , but there is a qualitative difference between Silicon Valley and other places . You tend to keep your voice down , because there 's a good chance the person at the next table would know some of the people you 're talking about . I never felt that in Boston . The good news is , there 's also a good chance the person at the next table could help you in some way .
6 . That the speakers at YC were so consistent in their advice . Actually , I 've noticed this too . I always worry the speakers will put us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell the startups , but it happens surprisingly rarely .
When I asked them what specific things they remembered speakers always saying , they mentioned : that the way to succeed was to launch something fast , listen to users , and then iterate ; that startups required resilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster ; and that most VCs were sheep .
I 've been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate launching fast and iterating . That was contrarian advice 10 years ago , but it 's clearly now the established practice .
7 . How casual successful startup founders are . Most of the famous founders in Silicon Valley are people you 'd overlook on the street . It 's not merely that they do n't dress up . They do n't project any kind of aura of power either . `` They 're not trying to impress anyone . ''
Interestingly , while Kate said that they could never pick out successful founders , they could recognize VCs , both by the way they dressed and the way they carried themselves .
8 . How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice . ( I swear I did n't prompt this one . ) Without advice `` they 'd just be sort of lost . '' Fortunately , there are a lot of people to help them . There 's a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC-funded startups . But we did n't invent that idea : it 's just a slightly more concentrated form of existing Valley culture .
9 . What a solitary task startups are . Architects are constantly interacting face to face with other people , whereas doing a technology startup , at least , tends to require long stretches of uninterrupted time to work . `` You could do it in a box . ''
By inverting this list , we can get a portrait of the `` normal '' world . It 's populated by people who talk a lot with one another as they work slowly but harmoniously on conservative , expensive projects whose destinations are decided in advance , and who carefully adjust their manner to reflect their position in the hierarchy .
That 's also a fairly accurate description of the past . So startup culture may not merely be different in the way you 'd expect any subculture to be , but a leading indicator .

Officials ID body found in downtown Santa Rosa
Santa Rosa police are investigating the death of a homeless man whose body was found Monday outside a downtown Santa Rosa restaurant .
Billy Edward Rosser , 32 , was found in an enclosed patio area of the shuttered Rendezvous Bistro by a transient man who called police at about 7:30 a.m. , Santa Rosa Police Lt. Ron Nelson said .
Investigators found nothing immediately suspicious about Rosser 's death . Nelson said it appeared the man had slept there and was found alongside what appeared to be some of their belongings .
Rosser grew up in Santa Rosa and had become homeless by choice three or four months ago after they were unable to pay rent , according to their brother Rickey Rosser , 34 , of Santa Rosa . Ricky Rosser said they last saw their brother three days ago .
“ We tried to get them to come back home , ” Ricky Rosser said .
But Billy Rosser refused , they said .
Ricky Rosser said they were surprised their brother was found downtown , because their brother recently told Rosser that they usually camped with a group of people off Stony Point Road near the Finley Center . They also said that they were concerned that their brother had been found wearing only their boxers following a cold , wet night .
Temperatures dropped to 53 degrees early Monday morning in Santa Rosa . The city received .41 inches of rain in 24 hours Sunday through Monday afternoon .
Jennielynn Holmes-Davis , director of shelter and housing for Catholic Charities , said rain often pushes homeless people to seek shelter closer to town where there are more awnings and covered areas .
“ Rain is different than dealing with the cold , it 's more difficult , ” Holmes-Davis said .
Monday morning , Catholic Charities staff opened up an additional 50 beds at the Sam Jones Hall shelter to address the increased need during the rainy winter months .
“ It was very busy . We had to have extra staff , ” Holmes-Davis said . “ We 're trying to get as many in as possible . ”
Rosser 's body was under the red awning of the restaurant , which has been closed since January 2014 . It was out of view of anyone walking in front of the restaurant on the corner of Fourth Street and Courthouse Square .
Word spread early Monday downtown about the death .
“ It 's so sad , ” said Pete Mogannam , owner of Fourth Street Market & Deli , across the street from Rendezvous Bistro .
Mogannam said he 's noticed an increase in the number of transients spending the night in the area in recent months . As they come to work at about 5 a.m. they typically see four to six people sleeping in plain sight in business doorways and front steps in the blocks around their shop .
Many of the street folks regularly come into the deli , and they recognize many of them . This year , it seems there are more than ever before , they said , wishing there was a better program available to help people get off the street and deal with alcohol or drug issues they may have .
“ I deal with it every day , ” Mogannam said . “ There are so many new faces . ”
Vice Mayor Chris Coursey said that Rosser 's death is “ terrible ” and an indication that the city needs to continue its growing Housing First initiative to connect people with housing .
A point-in-time census of Sonoma County homeless done in January found the population had decreased 40 percent , to 2,000 people , compared to the last census in 2013 . However , the number of transient people seen in downtown Santa Rosa appears to buck that trend , Coursey said .
“ It 's more obvious to anyone with eyes that there are more people on the streets these days , ” Coursey said .

The homepage of VBTC , the first Bitcoin exchange in Vietnam that was launched July 9 , 2014
A private company launched Vietnam 's first Bitcoin exchange despite pledges from central government officials to shut it down and jail its operators .
Ho Chi Minh City-based VBTC Vietnam cooperated with Israeli company Bit2C to launch the exchange on July 9 at www.vbtc.vn , following a pilot run in late June , Thoi Bao Kinh Te Saigon reported .
The exchange was supposed to debut in April .
In February , the State Bank of Vietnam said it did not recognize the Bitcoin as a valid currency , citing similar rulings in nearby countries like Thailand , China , Malaysia , and Indonesia and developed ones like Russia , France , and Norway .
The e-commerce department at the Ministry of Industry and Trade also rejected the company 's efforts to establish the exchange floor on the grounds that Bitcoins are not a recognized currency or commodity in Vietnam .
Nguyen Tran Bao Phuong , co-founder and managing director of VBTC Vietnam , said the exchange allows the unrestricted trade of Bitcoins , the newspaper reported .
Phuong said Vietnam could offer a lucrative market for Bitcoins and their company is willing to cooperate with the authorities to fight crimes related to the stateless currency .
They compared Bitcoins to the Internet , which Vietnam introduced in 1995 after a long period of consideration .
Phuong argues that their company has been campaigning for the “ undeniable ” benefits of Bitcoins to several government agencies .
“ Even when a government does not accept Bitcoins , like in China , it 's very hard to establish a legal code to completely ban them , '' they said . `` Many governments actually want to bar Bitcoins but they ca n't . ”
the police to deal with those responsible for operating the exchange . `` Even when a government does not accept Bitcoins , like in China , it 's very hard to establish a legal code to completely ban them . '' -- Nguyen Tran Bao Phuong , co-founder of Vietnam 's first Bitcoin exchange VBTC
Bitcoins were introduced as an open source software in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto , possibly a pseudonym for one or more programmers .
Bui Quang Tien , head of the Payment Department at the central bank , said they plan to askthe police to deal with those responsible for operating the exchange .
Transactions using Bitcoins have been conducted in a dozen countries in Europe and America ; the currency itself is considered an asset .
Analysts said Bitcoins provide little guarantee of payment as there is no central authority or bank to take responsibility for their authenticity or provide protection in case of fraud .
Mt . Gox in Tokyo ( one of the two world 's largest Bitcoin exchanges along with Bitstamp in the UK ) collapsed on February 18 after 850,000 Bitcoins worth US $ 473 million were reportedly lost or stolen in a cyber-attack .
Bitstamp suspended withdrawals for several days due to a distributed denial-of-service ( DDOS ) attack .
( In response to a post thanking us for taking on a much-needed MMO Course Correction -- 7/17/2017 )
Thanks for the kind words and encouragement ! Much appreciated . Although I do n't think the entire future of the MMO genre is resting on our shoulders , I do believe we are at a significant crossroads : are we going to keep trying to make uber-expensive WoW-Killers , going mass-market , going the least common denominator ? Or are we going to recognize that within the huge 15+ million player gamespace that is online gaming , especially MMOs , that there are therefore LOTs of different types of players , many of whom want very different things out of their MMO experience than others ? Should we keep dumbing down these games trying to make sure we appeal to everyone by doing everything gamers could ever want but at the same time removing anything that couple possibly turn off another segment of players ? Should we keep pouring all of the money into the same pot , trying over and over to come up with an MMO that makes everyone happy all of the time ?
Or should we instead choose a target audience , a demographic within the greater online gaming space , and make the best damn game we can for that group ? Can we be strong enough , bold enough to say out loud : `` this game is , by design , NOT for everyone '' ? I mean , so many other industries and genres get it . Dark Souls makes no apology that it is NOT a casual game . Toyota when announcing their latest 4x4 truck does not make apologies that , from a high-speed handling perspective , this truck by design is NOT meant to compete with the latest Ferrari .
That 's the big hump I think the MMO genre really , really needs to get over . In the 'post-WoW ' world the genre really moved towards trying to become even more mass-market than WoW itself . Looking at WoW , Vanilla-WoW ( the game that was released ) is a lot different than WoW is today . Some of that is natural evolution , polishing , the implementation of new features , races , types of content , etc . In other words , all good stuff . But then some of it is merely a result of Blizzard trying to make WoW appeal to an even larger group of gamers -- even though they were already , by leaps and bounds , the most popular and profitable MMO on the face of the earth . But even Blizzard eventually realized the folly in all of this . Blizzard likes to go big , and they can go big where and when they want to . They 've earned a great reputation and , because of past success , they can pretty much devote the funds to make a new game anywhere they want . For a while they were making a 'sequel ' of sorts to WoW , although I 'm sure there were quite a few changes in terms of setting , gameplay , mechanics , etc . The game was called Titan . And it was cancelled when Blizzard realized they they 'd already grown the MMO gamespace about as far as anyone could ... they could either decide to specialize and focus future MMOs on specific audiences , holding true to what that audience wants and enjoys , or they could move along and dominate other computer and video game genres . As a large , extremely successful game developer I do n't think focusing on smaller groups and specializing multiple smaller games fit into their overall corporate strategy . So if Titan was n't going to significantly grow the MMO gamespace like WoW had , their choice was to cancel it . While that sort of bums me out and I feel for those who worked so hard on it , I also respect the decision . They 'd reached a point where if they continued to try to make their MMOs more mass market that the games themselves were simply going to cease to be MMOs anymore . If you go down the long road of eliminating anything that defines the MMO genre because it might be something some player does n't care for , where do you end up ? Where does that road eventually lead ? Well , I think we can already see quite far down that road -- check out the mega-expensive but likewise mega-watered down MMOs that have come out post-WoW . After all of that time , money , and effort the result has been MMOs that really are n't MMOs anymore . Some people do n't like to have to interact with a community , so remove the community . Some do n't like to have to find others to group with , so remove grouping . Some people do n't have the time to go after and earn powerful yet rare items , so make it either so all items are easily obtainable or make it so the rare ones can also be purchased for real money . Some people do n't want to have to play months or even years to play through a character to maximum level , so decrease this time and effort and make the game a quick rush to the 'end game ' , allowing people to bypass most of the content by jumping to whatever that 'end game ' is supposed to be , or even perceived to be .
The result has been games that lack the depth and game elements that make MMOs 'sticky ' . MMOs and their predecessors , text MUDs of the 80s and 90s , long ago identified gameplay elements , mechanics , content , etc . that compelled their players to stick around . Real friendships were formed . Shared experiences occurred . People worked long and hard building up their characters and the items they or they possessed . A lot of pride and real value was perceived by players and therefore they kept playing months or even years . The result were vibrant and evolving virtual worlds people would subscribe to playing . And when the content started to grow old , the development teams would either revamp old content , giving it a refresher of sorts , or they would add on new content -- new continents to explore , new races and classes to play , and new ways to advance your character . People loved it . EQ , one of the earlier MMOs , peaked at 500k subscribers and made over a half a billion dollars in profit for Sony . The Final Fantasy games came next and were very profitable . Lastly you had WoW , and , again , even though after awhile they started dumbing things down , if you look at the title in its entirety it 's been a very enjoyable , compelling , polished game and also an incredibly profitable venture .
But then we 've also seen the results of taking things too far , going too mainstream , and losing track of what really makes these games tick . Indeed so many attributes of MMOs that defined what an MMO was been deleted that it 's debatable whether many of these newer games are even MMOs in the first place . Regardless of names , however , what 's undeniable is that they 've become less sticky . No longer did they keep people interested month after month , year after year . No longer did they create communities and environments based on interdependence -- where your success could only be achieved if you worked well with others , worked as a team , shared experiences , etc . The entire subscription based revenue model , in fact , was almost obliterated off the face of the earth . At first some people claimed that gamers had somehow magically changed and no longer wanted to play games for months or years . Or to have to invest time and effort into character advancement . Or to be 'forced ' to become social and actually make real online friendships .
But the truth is that with every generation there is pretty much the same breakdown into what genres and styles of games people are interested in . MMOs were never for 'everybody ' any more than an FPS or RTS was for 'everybody ' . But for the people who did enjoy them , what was wrong with acknowledging this fact and then getting your butt in gear and making the best possible game for them that you could ? Choose your audience . Determine the resources you 'll need to make a game they 'll truly love and enjoy . And then commit to creating just that . That 's where we 're at for the moment , especially with MMOs ( although one could argue RTS games are in a similar if not worse state ) . Developers are finally realizing that the answer is n't somehow designing a game that everyone in the world would enjoy but rather to choose a healthy demographic and go after them with everything you 've creatively got . With Pantheon we 've chosen to focus on PvE and making the E in PvE matter a lot more than it has for some time . We 've decided to attract gamers who love to team up with each other and take on the AI -- cooperative gamers who want more than session based games but to work together in a truly persistent environment . We 've decided to go after people who want to explore and experience vast handcrafted worlds with compelling storylines and quests . We 've targeted the online gamer who when they experience something emotionally intense would rather experience that with other people -- that , to them at least , experiencing challenges and even overcoming them together and as a team provides for much more memorable shared experiences -- memories and nostalgia that just does n't naturally occur in single player games or even in online games where the other players you encounter you really never have a reason to get to know .
And there are other MMOs out there focusing on different target audiences -- PvP-centric games , more storytelling and RP games that contain both online and offline experiences , and much more . We think this is great and that there 's room for all sorts of MMOs . And even for those players who do want an online game but not one that takes time , or is difficult , one that is more casual and where making friends is truly optional -- we think it 's great for those games to be undergoing development as well . The only difference is that there are already plenty of MMO-lite games like that -- already many that have been launched , and then many more still being worked on . And from a business perspective it really does n't make sense for us to go and try to compete in an already well-served segment of the MMO genre . Rather it makes more sense for us , both from a business standpoint and a personal one , to go after the under-served segments and make MMOs that appeal not only to our target audience but also to ourselves .

NORTH TEXAS -- Announcing the “ feral hog apocalypse ” is within reach , Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller has approved of the first pesticide targeting wild pigs , CBS Dallas reports .
The estimated 2.5 million feral hogs in Texas cost an estimated $ 50 million a year in damage to Texas agriculture , according to the Austin American-Statesman . In addition to the damage to crops and livestock tanks , hogs cost untold damage to suburban yards .
Miller said they will use the pesticide , Kaput Feral Hog Lure , as bait food laced with warfarin which is the same drug used to kill rats . It can also be prescribed by doctors , in smaller doses , to prevent blood clots
But the move has upset hunters , who 've gathered more than 1,200 signatures in opposition within two days .
“ We do n't think poison is the way to go , ” said Eydin Hansen , Vice President of the Texas Hog Hunters Association .
They prefer hunting and trapping methods to control the invasive species .
Hansen has been hunting hogs since they were 16 .
“ It 's a way to feed your family , ” they said .
They worry soon they wo n't want to take that risk .
“ If this hog is poisoned , do I want to feed it to my family ? I can tell you , I do n't . ”
Hunters and conservationists are afraid other animals may be exposed to toxin .
“ If a hog dies , what eats it ? Coyotes , buzzards… ” said Hansen . “ We 're gon na affect possibly the whole ecosystem . ”
The Kaput product website claims its low toxicity decreases that risk .
The company has also created a bait station to disseminate it that limits access to other wildlife .
Hansen remains skeptical .
“ I personally do n't think it 's going to work , ” they said .
Miller told the state , in light of the product 's approval , their department would no longer need $ 900,000 earmarked for feral hog control research .
As a state senator , Miller authored legislation that allowed for the shooting of wild hogs from helicopters . Now , more than 27,000 wild pigs are killed that way , according to the Austin American-Statesman .
A new mobile WiFi hotspot device about the size of a credit card is threatening to make USB cellular modems look primitive . One such devices is the Novatel Wireless MiFi 2200 Intelligent Mobile Hotspot . It works by tapping into the Verizon 3G Mobile broadband network to create a personalized WiFi 'cloud ' for a fixed number of devices within a 50 foot area .
USB-based modems boast similar features in allowing users to connect to the Internet while in motion or from a remote location . However , the biggest drawback of using a USB modem is that they are exclusive to only one device . ( Source : usatoday.com )
MiFi , in contrast , can be shared with up to five computers and/or other WiFi-capable devices , including smartphones and digital cameras . The Novatel MiFi 2200 in particular is small , portable and requires no additional plug-ins to operate . It has a single on/off button complete with color-changing status lights to show the strength of the connection and the life of the battery .
MiFi 2200 Hampered by Short Battery Life
Since the MiFi 2220 uses a battery , it must be recharged frequently . It takes about 2.5 hours to re-charge the battery and an AC wall charger is included . While being charged , the MiFi 2200 can be used as a fixed hot spot to share Internet . When there are periods of inactivity , the MiFi activates a `` sleep '' mode , thus prolonging the life of the battery . ( Source : usatoday.com )
The battery is expected to last for 40 hours when in `` sleep '' mode , but only lasts approximately 4 hours when active . With more users using the device , the battery drains even faster .
Password Protection
There have been questions raised abut the security of the product . Many reason that if your personalized `` cloud '' stretches up to 50 feet , what 's stopping an unauthorized user from hopping on to the Internet on your dime ?
To get around this problem , the MiFi 2200 provides an individualized network password written on a sticker at the bottom of every MiFi device . Now the password can be shared with only those authorized by the owner .
The MiFi 2200 costs about $ 100 after a mail-in rebate . All consumers will be required to sign up for a two-year data plan with every purchase . ( Source : testfreaks.com )
A slide from an internal NSA presentation indicating that the agency uses at least one Google cookie as a way to identify targets for exploitation . ( Washington Post )
The National Security Agency is secretly piggybacking on the tools that enable Internet advertisers to track consumers , using `` cookies '' and location data to pinpoint targets for government hacking and to bolster surveillance .
The agency 's internal presentation slides , provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden , show that when companies follow consumers on the Internet to better serve them advertising , the technique opens the door for similar tracking by the government . The slides also suggest that the agency is using these tracking techniques to help identify targets for offensive hacking operations .
For years , privacy advocates have raised concerns about the use of commercial tracking tools to identify and target consumers with advertisements . The online ad industry has said its practices are innocuous and benefit consumers by serving them ads that are more likely to be of interest to them .
The revelation that the NSA is piggybacking on these commercial technologies could shift that debate , handing privacy advocates a new argument for reining in commercial surveillance .
According to the documents , the NSA and its British counterpart , GCHQ , are using the small tracking files or `` cookies '' that advertising networks place on computers to identify people browsing the Internet . The intelligence agencies have found particular use for a part of a Google-specific tracking mechanism known as the “ PREF ” cookie . These cookies typically do n't contain personal information , such as someone 's name or e-mail address , but they do contain numeric codes that enable Web sites to uniquely identify a person 's browser .
In addition to tracking Web visits , this cookie allows NSA to single out an individual 's communications among the sea of Internet data in order to send out software that can hack that person 's computer . The slides say the cookies are used to `` enable remote exploitation , '' although the specific attacks used by the NSA against targets are not addressed in these documents .
The NSA 's use of cookies is n't a technique for sifting through vast amounts of information to find suspicious behavior ; rather , it lets NSA home in on someone already under suspicion - akin to when soldiers shine laser pointers on a target to identify it for laser-guided bombs .
Separately , the NSA is also using commercially gathered information to help it locate mobile devices around the world , the documents show . Many smartphone apps running on iPhones and Android devices , and the Apple and Google operating systems themselves , track the location of each device , often without a clear warning to the phone 's owner . This information is more specific than the broader location data the government is collecting from cellular phone networks , as reported by the Post last week .
`` On a macro level , 'we need to track everyone everywhere for advertising ' translates into 'the government being able to track everyone everywhere , ' '' says Chris Hoofnagle , a lecturer in residence at UC Berkeley Law . `` It 's hard to avoid . ''
These specific slides do not indicate how the NSA obtains Google PREF cookies or whether the company cooperates in these programs , but other documents reviewed by the Post indicate that cookie information is among the data NSA can obtain with a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act order . If the NSA gets the data that way , the companies know and are legally compelled to assist .
The NSA declined to comment on the specific tactics outlined in this story , but an NSA spokesperson sent the Post a statement : `` As we 've said before , NSA , within its lawful mission to collect foreign intelligence to protect the United States , uses intelligence tools to understand the intent of foreign adversaries and prevent them from bringing harm to innocent Americans . ''
Google declined to comment for this article , but chief executive Larry Page joined the leaders of other technology companies earlier this week in calling for an end to bulk collection of user data and for new limits on court-approved surveillance requests . `` The security of users ' data is critical , which is why we 've invested so much in encryption and fight for transparency around government requests for information , '' Page said in a statement on the coalition 's Web site . `` This is undermined by
the apparent wholesale collection of data , in secret and without independent oversight , by many governments around the world . ''
How consumers are tracked online
Internet companies store small files called cookies on users ' computers to uniquely identify them for ad-targeting and other purposes across many different Web sites . This advertising-driven business model pays for many of the services , like e-mail accounts , that consumers have come to expect to have for free . Yet few are aware of the full extent to which advertisers , services and Web sites track their activities across the Web and mobile devices . These data collection mechanisms are invisible to all but the most sophisticated users -- and the tools to opt-out or block them have limited effectiveness .
Privacy advocates have pushed to create a `` Do Not Track '' system allowing consumers to opt out of such tracking . But Jonathan Mayer of Stanford 's Center for Internet and Society , who has been active in that push , says `` Do Not Track efforts are stalled out . '' They ground to a halt when the Digital Advertising Alliance , a trade group representing online ad companies , abandoned the effort in September after clashes over the proposed policy . One of the primary issues of contention was whether consumers would be able to opt out of all tracking , or just not be served advertisements based on tracking .
Some browsers , such as Apple 's Safari , automatically block a type of code known as `` third-party cookies , '' which are often placed by companies that advertise on the site being visited . Other browsers such as Mozilla 's Firefox are also experimenting with that idea . But such settings wo n't prevent users from receiving cookies directly from the primary sites they visit or services they use .
Google 's PREF Cookie
Google assigns a unique PREF cookie anytime someone 's browser makes a connection to any of the company 's Web properties or services . This can occur when consumers directly use Google services such as Search or Maps , or when they visit Web sites that contain embedded `` widgets '' for the company 's social media platform Google Plus . That cookie contains a code that allows Google to uniquely track users to `` personalize ads '' and measure how they use other Google products .
Given the widespread use of Google services and widgets , most Web users are likely to have a Google PREF cookie even if they 've never visited a Google property directly .
That PREF cookie is specifically mentioned in an internal NSA slide , which reference the NSA using GooglePREFID , their shorthand for the unique numeric identifier contained within Google 's PREF cookie . Special Source Operations ( SSO ) is an NSA division that works with private companies to scoop up data as it flows over the Internet 's backbone and from technology companies ' own systems . The slide indicates that SSO was sharing information containing `` logins , cookies , and GooglePREFID '' with another NSA division called Tailored Access Operations , which engages in offensive hacking operations . SSO also shares the information with the British intelligence agency GCHQ .
`` This shows a link between the sort of tracking that 's done by Web sites for analytics and advertising and NSA exploitation activities , '' says Ed Felten , a computer scientist at Princeton University . `` By allowing themselves to be tracked for analytic or advertising at least some users are making themselves more vulnerable to exploitation . ''
This is n't the first time Google cookies have been highlighted in the NSA 's attempts to identify targets to hack . A presentation released in October by the Guardian called `` Tor Stinks '' indicates that the agency was using cookies for DoubleClick.net , Google 's third-party advertising service , in an attempt to identify users of the Internet anonymization tool Tor when they switched to regular browsing . `` It 's similar in the sense that you see the use of an unique ID in the cookie to allow an eavesdropper to connect the activities of a user over time , '' says Felten .

Leaked location data
Another slide indicates that the NSA is collecting location data transmitted by mobile apps to support ad-targeting efforts in bulk . The NSA program , code-named HAPPYFOOT , helps the NSA to map Internet addresses to physical locations more precisely than is possible with traditional Internet geolocation services .
Many mobile apps and operating systems use location-based services to help users find restaurants or establishments nearby . In fact , even when GPS is disabled , most smart phones silently determine their location in the background using signals from Wi-Fi networks or cellular towers .
And apps that do not need geo-location data may still collect it anyway to share with third-party advertisers . Just last week , the Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement for a seemingly innocuous flashlight app that allegedly leaked user location information to advertisers without consumers ' knowledge .
Apps transmit their locations to Google and other Internet companies because ads tied to a precise physical location can be more lucrative than generic ads . But in the process , they appear to tip off the NSA to a mobile device 's precise physical location . That makes it easier for the spy agency to engage in the sophisticated tracking techniques the Post described in a story Dec. 4 .
Implications for privacy
The disclosures about NSA practices reveal the dilemma facing online companies , which have faced a backlash against tracking for commercial purposes and their role in government surveillance .
`` If data is used and it stops the next 9/11 our fellow citizens would n't have any problem with it no matter what it is , '' says Stuart P. Ingis , General Counsel at the Digital Advertising Association . But they say that it is a balancing act to pursue those bad actors `` while at the same time preserving the civil liberties . ''
Other defenders of online advertising companies have argued it is unfair to conflate private companies ' ad-tracking activities with the NSA activities revealed in the Snowden leaks . Marvin Ammori , a lawyer who advises technology companies including Google on surveillance issues , wrote in USA Today that `` limiting bulk data collection by private companies - whether they advertise or not - would do little or nothing to limit the NSA . ''
Felten disagrees , noting that the latest documents show that `` the unique identifiers that are being placed on users ' computers are not only being used by analytic and advertising companies , but also being used by the NSA for targeting . '' They also say that there are things those companies could do to protect their users from the type of attacks described in the slides , like `` not sending tracking IDs , or at least not sending them in the clear '' without a layer of encryption .
Similarly , they say , `` browser makers can help by giving users better control over the use of third-party tracking cookies and by making sure that their browsers are not sending unique IDs as a side effect of their safe-browsing behavior . ''
Stanford 's Mayer says the revelations suggest the need for limits on the data that companies collect about consumers . `` There 's increasingly a sense that giving consumers control over the information they share with companies is all the more important , '' they say , `` because you 're also giving them control over the information they share with government . ''

The origins of the Austin-Healey 100 is worth considering because it became one of the most iconic British cars yet it was created using the mechanicals of a car that was a forgettable disaster . The Austin-Healey 100 was built on the mechanicals of the ill conceived Austin A90 Atlantic and it succeeded where the A90 Atlantic failed . The story begins in post World War II Britain in Austin Motor Corporation where it was understood that they needed to create a car for export and preferably one that would sell well in the United States . The boffins at Austin got together and created a car that was safe and had unusual almost avant garde styling and that was to be marketed as being exotic , exciting , and safe . The only trouble was that the A90 was about as exotic as a plate of British bangers and mash and certainly no more exciting . What the Austin management and design team had not understood was that Austin could not compete with American cars by creating something ordinary . What Austin needed to do was create a car that movie stars would drive , and they did n't know how to do that .
Austin put the A90 Atlantic into production in 1949 and it did n't take long before Leonard Lord , Austin 's Chairman of the Board , realized that they 'd got their new car hopelessly wrong .
It was whilst they were attending the London Motor Show in 1952 that Leonard Lord saw the car that they and their team at Austin should have thought of . This sports car had been created by Donald Healey with a body design by Gerry Coker and chassis by Barry Bilbie . This was the Healey 100 , so named because it was designed to do 100mph , and it was a star of the London Motor Show that year . The Healey stand was being flooded with orders for the car and Donald Healey was aware that they did not have the production capacity to fulfill those orders . The important point is that the Healey 100 was based on Austin A90 Atlantic mechanicals . Leonard Lord saw the car , saw the public reaction and arranged to meet with Donald Healey over dinner to see if a mutually beneficial arrangement could be arrived at . The two men agreed to Austin building the cars as the Austin-Healey with Jensen Motors making the bodywork . The Austin-Healey 100 was born .
The Austin-Healey entered production in 1953 and it was all the car that the A90 Atlantic was not . It was low slung , light , fast , and wonderfully exciting to drive . The Austin-Healey 100 was and is a sports car with a lot of personality . To get the car before the public eye and to build up some “ street cred ” for it the decision was made to modify a couple of Austin-Healey 100 's and enter them in the 24 Hour Le Mans race that same year . The two cars finished at Le Mans , which was an achievement in itself , in 12th and 14th places and that success made the name Austin-Healey well known in short order . There was a market for a modification kit for owners of stock standard Austin-Healey 100 's to retro-fit their cars to “ Le Mans ” specification and Austin-Healey lost no time in creating just such a kit that an owner could fit themselves . The kit comprised a pair of 1¾ ” SU HD6 carburettors mounted on a different inlet manifold which had a cold air box , a new high lift camshaft and stronger valve springs to cope with it , and a distributor with a more performance oriented ignition advance curve . This bolt on kit increased engine power from 90bhp to 100bhp . But owners wanted more .
In 1955 the original BN1 Austin-Healey 100 was upgraded to the BN2 which replaced the original three speed gearboxes with overdrive with a four speed gearbox also with overdrive . For the BN2 Austin-Healey decided to offer a factory fitted Le Mans performance kit . This new kit included all the parts of the bolt on Le Mans kit but with new high compression pistons in the engine which was covered by a louvered bonnet/hood to help keep that hot 2.660cc engine cool and to provide a more businesslike look . These factory cars also had suspension modifications which comprised a stiffer front roll bar and Armstrong shock absorbers . The factory built Austin-Healey 100M as this car was called had engine power of 110bhp and with the windscreen folded down could do around 120mph . Only 640 of these 100M cars were built and of them 544 were exported to the United States .
The “ Old English White ” and red trim Austin-Healey 100M in our pictures is one of those 640 factory produced “ Le Mans ” specification cars . It comes with the factory hard top and soft top . The car will be coming up for auction by Bonhams at their Les Grandes Marques du Monde au Grand Palais auction on 9th February 2017 .

Lindsey Paris and their son today ( Photo courtesy of Paris )
Lindsey Paris was excited when they saw a new “ like ” pop up on the Facebook page that she 'd set up for their blog Red Head Baby Mama . But the feeling quickly turned into shock after the Atlanta mother clicked on the name of the woman who 'd given the thumbs up to a photo of Paris ' then 18-month-old son . The stranger had made the toddler 's image their homepage photo and was presenting Paris ' son as their own child . “ I flew into a mother lion rage , then I burst into tears , ” Paris tells Yahoo Parenting , of the 2012 incident that still has them on edge . “ She was pretending that they were their own and commenting on when was they going to start teething . Them friends were saying that they loved their hair . They were treating them as their own and that was the most petrifying thing . I did n't know people did this . ”
STORY : ‘ Safer Internet Day ' Raises Important Topics
Paris soon learned all about the relatively rare but disturbing online trend of role playing with photos of other people 's children stolen from social media accounts . “ It is n't a technical crime , ” they say , so the blogger did the only thing they could . Paris messaged the woman , who turned out to be a 16 year old girl in California , and the teen apologized two days after Paris 's “ forcefully polite ” note asking them to take the photo down . “ She said she 'd always wanted a red-headed son and ‘ I did n't mean to hurt you . ' ”
STORY : Nanny Freaks as Baby Monitor Is Hacked
Nashville mother Ashley B ( who prefers to remain anonymous ) suffered a similar experience , typically referred to as “ digital kidnapping ” or “ virtual kidnapping ” this past summer when the hobbyist photographer clicked on the Facebook update that a photo she 'd taken of one of their daughters , aged 3 and 6 , had been shared by someone unfamiliar . “ It took me to the page of a man in China , ” Ashley tells Yahoo Parenting . “ The page was in Chinese and I could n't read any of it but I saw that they had a few thousand followers and they had shared my picture . I started scrolling and noticed they had the lot of pictures of little girls . I was so scared and shocked . I mean , that share linked back to my personal page so anybody could have clicked on it to see where I lived. ” Ashley immediately deleted the post , went into their privacy settings and locked them down . Until then , they admit , “ I knew privacy settings were not locked down as much as they could be , but I was n't really concerned about it . ”
But with tens of thousands of Instagram and Twitter posts hashtagged # BabyRP , for Baby Role Play , and # KidRP , Paris 's and Ashley 's stories are n't isolated incidents . More than 1,000 people signed the 2014 Change.org petition calling for Instagram to “ Put an end to the baby and child role play accounts. ” And it seems that no image , or child , is off limits . Earlier this month , Texas father Caleb Kaminer shared the story of their daughter 's picture being stolen off of a social media site he 'd started as a community page for families with children who have Dysphagia , a condition marked by difficulty swallowing .
Paris and Ashley , for instance , now use a privacy app KidsLink to share photos with only the friends and family whom they 've approved to view the images and who also belong to their network in the app . “ Only the people you 've chosen can see it , ” KidsLink “ Chief mom officer ” Titania Jordan tells Yahoo Parenting of the tool . “ There 's no second wave of sharing that you 're not aware of , no strangers searching your images , no stalking. ” Subscribers can also post photos to Facebook or Instagram from the app , which wipes each image clean of any location or linking metadata that would allow someone to show up in the photographer 's backyard . “ It 's better to be safe than sorry , ” Jordan says . “ This is a happy medium between going dark and putting it all out there . ”
It 's smart be cognizant of privacy measures when it comes to kids ' photos agrees Denise Lisi DeRosa , a program manager at the Family Online Safety Institute . “ Lots of people do n't seem to fully understand how to use the privacy settings , ” DeRosa tells Yahoo Parenting , of social media sites . “ But it 's hugely important to stay up to date them . ”
There is a Children 's Online Privacy Protection Act that “ imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age , and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age , ” according to The Federal Trade Commission . But DeRosa points out that if you 're posting pictures of children publicly , the law ca n't do what it 's intended to do . “ You need to take responsibility to show and share photos as safely as possible , ” they say .
The Democratic primary race for Syracuse mayor ended last night with former Navy Lieutenant Commander and attorney Juanita Perez-Williams taking the Democratic party line on the ballot , after their convincing win over Joe Nicoletti and Marty Masterpole .
Now , attention shifts from the primary to the general election in November . Perez Williams , Republican Laura Lavine , Independent and Reform Party candidate Ben Walsh , and Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins , are all prepared to campaign for the job over the next eight weeks .
CNYCentral sat down with each of the four active candidates in the race for Syracuse mayor , asking them what they think are the most considerable challenges the city faces .
Reform candidate Ben Walsh aims to use their passion and experience to help combat poverty .
`` Poverty is a significant challenge in this community , we need to help put more people in positions where they can pursue economic opportunity , '' Walsh said .
Republican candidate Laura Lavine wants to put an end to violence in the city .
`` Unfortunately , we had a record homicide rate last year and a lot of that I believe is largely attributed to the fact that we do n't have a fully staffed police department . We 're down approximately 50 officers , '' Lavine said .
Howie Hawkins of the Green Party hopes to get those facing poverty back into the city 's workforce . Their short-term goal is , `` to help poor people with access to city funded jobs . ''
Hawkins believes that , `` instead of incentives for absentee-owned businesses that take profits out of the community , the incentive should go to developing work around cooperatives . ''
Democrat Juanita Perez Williams wants every neighbor in the city to feel like their voice is being heard .
`` Neighborhood revitalization . It 's going to every neighborhood you know finding out exactly what people are hoping for , with regard to their needs , their streets , jobs , whatever it is their children need , '' Perez Williams said .
A question that remains unanswered is how involved Joe Nicoletti will be in the race . The Democrat lost the primary Tuesday night , but retains a line on the ballot with the Working Families Party . Nicoletti has not yet said if they will continue an active campaign for mayor .
Partner of Hobbit star Martin Freeman goes bankrupt 'over £120,000 tax bill ' despite them being worth £10m
Mr Selfridge actor Amanda Abbington , 41 , declared insolvent in London 's High Court
They have two children with Mr Freeman and they share a £900,000 house in Hertfordshire
Them partner is the multi-million-pound star of The Hobbit , but actor Amanda Abbington appears to have been less fortunate with their own finances .
Miss Abbington , who featured in ITV period drama Mr Selfridge , has been forced to declare themselves bankrupt over a £120,000 tax bill , it emerged yesterday .
The 41-year-old mother of two 's bankruptcy order was registered in the High Court under their birth name Amanda Jane Smith .

Amanda Abbington , seen here with their long-time partner Martin Freeman , has been declared bankrupt
Despite their partner Martin Freeman 's fortune – most of it accumulated after landing the role of Bilbo Baggins in the three Hobbit films – Miss Abbington will have to pay off only a fraction of their debt .
A source told The Sun : ‘ Amanda has done nothing legally wrong , but I am sure Revenue & Customs officials will be fuming on missing out on their cash , especially given their common-law husband is a very successful actor .
‘ Bankruptcy laws recognise individuals rather than couples , so the penniless partner of a wealthy person is free to go bust like anyone else . '
Miss Abbington and Freeman – whose TV roles include Watson in the BBC series Sherlock and Tim Canterbury in The Office – have been together for 11 years and have a six-year-old son and four-year-old daughter . They are said to have met on the set of Channel 4 's Men Only in 2000 .
Hollywood star : Martin Freeman is said to have earned millions for their starring role in The Hobbit , pictured Amanda Abbington stars as the head of accessories Miss Mardle in ITV1 's hit show Mr Selfridge
'She is my rock in all things ' : Amanda Abbington and Martin Freeman have been together for 12 years
They refer to each other as husband and wife and live in a £900,000 house in Potters Bar , Hertfordshire .
Last night a spokesperson for Miss Abbington said : ‘ We do not comment on any aspect of our clients ' personal lives . '
Freeman secured the starring role in The Hobbit trilogy . The first of the three films based on JRR Tolkien 's novel of the same name was released in December and is already thought to have grossed more than $ 1billion ( £660million ) at the box office .
The second film is due to be released in December this year .
Miss Abbington 's bankruptcy declaration comes only a few weeks after that of 36-year-old former EastEnders star Martine McCutcheon , with debts of £187,000 .
The actor , who is believed to have earned up to £250,000 a year at the height of their popularity in the BBC 1 soap , made the petition in their given name , Martine Kimberley Sherrie Ponting .
Them discharge from bankruptcy is set for January next year and KPMG has been appointed as their trustee .
Them bankruptcy came a few months after they married musician Jack McManus , 29 , on the shores of Lake Como in Italy .
In 2003 it was reported that they were worth £1.5million and was living in upmarket Kensington , West London .
One of the latest Android 2.2 upgrade rumors is dealing with the HTC Desire and when it will be given Froyo . At this point there is a date as to when that will happen , however its really to be considered nothing more than rumor at this point .
That said , the HTC Desire is expected to get an update to Android 2.2 Froyo as of June 23rd .
As to where the details are coming from — a customer service rep from HTC – so take that as you see fit . What was actually said was a little more sly and the word of Froyo was actually delivered as this ;
“ But you never heard this from me… . A new update is coming the 23rd of June and you will be able to put some apps on to the micro sd card . ”
That said , I guess we can wait until June 23 and in the meantime keep an eye out for some more information .

After gunmen stormed a French newspaper 's offices and killed 12 people , Prime Minster Stephen Harper instructed their cabinet and senior officials to reach out to their French counterparts and to offer assistance .
Mr. Harper called the attack `` a barbaric act '' that serves as a `` grim reminder that no country is immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world , '' including the killings of soldiers in Ottawa and Quebec as well as the December shootings in Sydney , Australia .
`` Canada and its allies will not be intimidated and will continue to stand firmly together against terrorists who would threaten the peace , freedom and democracy our countries so dearly value . Canadians stand with France on this dark day , '' the Prime Minister said in a statement .

The Prime Minister was briefed on the incident by David Vigneault , assistant secretary to the cabinet on security and intelligence . The government announced one day earlier that it was appointing Richard Fadden as the Prime Minister 's new national security adviser , but they have yet to assume the position .
The terror-alert level remained stable in Canada , according to a government official . The domestic-terrorism threat level was raised from low to medium three months ago , around the time of two terror attacks on Canadian soil , and was not changed after the attack against the offices of Charlie Hebdo .
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Minister Steven Blaney laid a dozen roses in front of the French consulate in Quebec City , stating it was an expression of Canada 's solidarity with the French . They said freedom of expression was a crucial value in all modern societies , and that terrorism must be fought by all allied countries .
`` France and Canada are in tears for these families who have lost loved ones , we are standing together and we share your grief , '' Mr. Blaney said in Quebec City , alongside French Consul-General Nicolas Chibaeff .
Earlier in the day , Mr. Blaney reached out to their French counterpart , Bernard Cazeneuve , to offer Canada 's assistance if necessary .
NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair , whose wife is French and who holds dual Canadian and French citizenship , condemned the `` senseless violence . ''
Mr. Mulcair made a point of holding a news conference on the matter in the National Press Theatre in Ottawa , saying they wanted to speak out in the home of the parliamentary press corps .

`` Everybody in the world who treasures fundamental values like freedom of expression , freedom of religion , freedom of assembly , understands the importance of standing up to this sort of cowardly gesture , '' they said .
Mr. Mulcair added that they remain concerned about the security of their family . The NDP called on the RCMP for increased protection last fall , after the shooting on Parliament Hill , but Mr. Mulcair said they were not satisfied by the response .
`` We continue to be concerned . So far , there has not been any conclusive answer from the RCMP , '' they said .
Eating a puppy no worse than eating pork , says TV chef BelfastTelegraph.co.uk TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has declared that eating puppy meat is no more morally objectionable than consuming pork . https : //www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/food-drink/eating-a-puppy-no-worse-than-eating-pork-says-tv-chef-28667861.html https : //www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/migration_catalog/article25779624.ece/6d672/AUTOCROP/h342/IN4935947 @ File % 20photo % 20dated % 20

TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has declared that eating puppy meat is no more morally objectionable than consuming pork .
The River Cottage star has spent more than five months being a vegetarian for their latest series of the TV show and has penned non-meat recipes for a cookbook .
Fearnley-Whittingstall ( 46 ) has eaten placenta pate , curried fruit bat , giraffe and calf testicles in the past .
Asked whether they would try loin of Labrador or cat liver , they told the Radio Times : `` Not unless I was on the point of starvation .
`` In principle , but not in practice , I have no objection to a high-welfare organic puppy farm .
`` You ca n't object , unless you also object to the farming of pigs . It 's an artificial construct of our society to make pets out of dogs and meat out of pigs . ''
Asked whether their vegetarianism was a gimmick to write another book in their £1.9 million publishing deal , they told the magazine : `` I do n't think we 're gimmicky . I started by looking at where food came from , rearing our animals and growing our food . ''
The chef , who has campaigned for sustainable fish and highlighted issues surrounding the mass production of chickens , said : `` I like to think we 're driving the agenda . ''

GNOME Software has a documented test plan now .
Appearantly the FIA ( Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile ) have sent out a “ cease and desist ” letter to several modding teams working on mods resembling FIA governed cars and series . A cease and desist letter is a request to a party to halt an activity and not take it up again or face legal action . It is rumoured that more unauthorized modding projects are under investigation , including hardware mods . In essence , it is not yet known if this crusade will only impact the open wheeler series , or if it will apply to more related racing series .
One of the modding teams that where recently hit are the F1ASR team . They where working on an Ferrari 643 F1 and Formula 1 1992 mod . After receiving the cease and desist letter , the team announced that they will suspend work on the mods till further notice .
It looks like this will not just stop there . A month ago we at Bsimracing received a cease and desist letter from a well known brand requesting us not to post or promote any to their brand related software and Hardware mod news . VirtualR.net received a similar Formula 1 related “ cease and desist ” request only a few months ago .
The last few years it has been discussed and debated that with the growing Sim Racing popularity also the rules of the game could get stricter . A while ago the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile ( FIA ) announced a long term partnership with Polyphony Digital ( Gran Turismo ) , revealing that there might be an FIA sanctioned Sim Racing championship in the making . With federations such as the FIA involved Sim Racing could soon become a sport . As with all sports , advertising and sponsorship will have their influence on what can and can not be done .
The Modding scene also changed allot the last few years . With high detailed and higher quality models , the risk of being associated with a product is becoming apparent . High quality mods could also be seen as competition for licenced material by the established companies . Then there are trends such as paid modding and sponsored leagues and teams that might open up a can of worms when it comes to copyright infringements and people creating revenue with it . The multiple cross-platform conversions that appear lately have also raised attention and could become an issue in the near future .
The Sim Scene is taken more serious and is now recognised as a business platform by many marketeers out there . While that is ultimately a good thing , it will change the way the established companies look at our little niche community . The bigger the market becomes , the more opportunities it will create for marketing . These opportunities will generate a bigger competition . If Sim Racing and the commercial world get even closer , there might be no room left for ” tolerated art ” such as modding . Sim Racing livery services such as used in LFS and the “ Trading Paints ” project for iRacing might become a topic of discussion soon . Fingers crossed .
Terry Crews , seriously , all allies should aspire to be as excellent as you .
Speaking with Dame Magazine , Crews spoke eloquently about gender and how we represent ourselves when talking about how much of themselves they bring to their character on Brooklyn Nine-Nine . “ Every man and every woman has both sexes in them [ … ] We have to embrace the duality that we are , ” said Crews . “ I 'm an artist – I love painting and drawing , and I play the flute , and people go , ‘ Man , that 's feminine ! ' But why is that feminine ? That 's just human . If you feel that is feminine , you 're judging yourself based on what other people 's reactions might be . ”
The former NFL player , who is now married with five children ( four of whom are girls ) and one granddaughter , said that they have had to do some “ serious thinking ” about the world in which he 's raising their children , and that 's part of what made them want to actively speak out about feminism and the fight for equality . “ When I see the world and the way people are treated , I see so many domination and control issues , ” said Crews . “ The truth is , everyone is equal and valuable , and everyone is necessary , but there tends to be a dismissal of certain groups . ”
But , Crews clarifies , he 's not trying to speak for women , but rather to be the best ally they can . “ Women are more than capable of handling themselves , and have been doing so wonderfully for years , ” explained Crews . “ What I am saying is , as one man to another man , examine your own mind-set . Examine what makes you tick . Because if you feel that you are more valuable than your wife and kids , that 's a problem. ” In their book Manhood , Crews cites male pride as something that stops men from changing their outlook on how they treat women .
Crews also spoke at length about rape culture and its prevalence in the world of sports and football , noting that he 's known many men who believed women were responsible for their own sexual assaults because of how they were dressed . “ Once I realized that I was part of that culture , I knew that I had to change it , ” Crews said , citing 50 Shades of Grey as an example of pop culture projecting abuse as romance , and said that it 's simple in our society for men to use lies , guilt , and shame to control women – something he 's seen at length in their work with the Polaris Project to stop human trafficking .
“ We 're not talking Game of Thrones stuff , ” added Crews . “ we 're talking very subtle mind games that change cultures , and change how people live . We 've got to address these mindsets that say that 's cool . A reaction I get from certain people is , ‘ Hey man , chill , it 's not that deep . ' Everything 's that deep . Do n't wash your hands , and serve food at a restaurant , and you 'll find out how deep things get real quick . It starts with one small thing , and you can cause a whole chain reaction . ”

There was a revealing detail in Bicycle Dutch 's post last week on a ( failed ) attempt to create a cycle street in Utrecht in the 1990s .
One of the main cycle routes to the Utrecht University , Burgemeester Reigerstraat , was completely transformed and re-opened as a bicycle street in November 1996 . The street got a median barrier to prevent motor vehicles from overtaking people cycling .
Here 's a picture of that arrangement , from Mark 's blog .
Note here Mark 's description of driver behaviour on this street –
Emergency services also complained and they warned about dangerous situations because they were held up . Impatient car drivers were seen overtaking cyclists with two wheels on the barrier . [ my emphasis ] . This scared people cycling onto the narrow side-walk and that in turn frightened pedestrians . A good two years later ( in January 1999 ) a new Utrecht council terminated the experiment . The centre barriers were removed and so were the signs that forbade to overtake people cycling .
In fact , you can clearly see a driver doing this in the photograph above – squeezing past , very close to someone cycling , driving up on the central median .
This should n't really come as a surprise . Dutch drivers really are just as bad as British ones when confronted with design that puts them into conflict with people cycling . The reason why we have a skewed impression of the quality of Dutch driving is that – by and large – Dutch road design separates cycling from driving , and insulates people cycling from the consequences of driver misbehaviour .
As I 've commented before , in trips across towns and cities you will encounter a tiny fraction of the number of drivers you would on an equivalent trip in Britain . On main roads you will be physically separated from drivers , and on side streets you will encounter few drivers because these streets are not sensible routes for through traffic .
And in these few places where you do come into contact with drivers , design ensures that priorities are clear and unambiguous , and that drivers behave in a slow and careful manner – for instance , by placing side road crossings on steep raised tables that drivers have to drive over .
However , just as on that failed design in Utrecht in the 1990s , when Dutch drivers are confronted by design that does n't make sense , they will behave badly .
On busy through roads that have little or no cycle infrastructure , they will squeeze past you , into oncoming traffic , in precisely the same way that some British drivers will do , confronted by the same situation .
On country lanes ( that are access-only roads ) they will drive very close to you at high speed , just like some British drivers will .
On busier rural roads – without cycle tracks – they will squeeze through at speed , into oncoming traffic –
They will even squeeze through at the same time oncoming traffic is overtaking someone cycling the other way .
On the narrow streets of central Amsterdam , drivers will follow very close behind you , and squeeze past with inches to spare .
Many of these streets allow contraflow cycling ( like the example above ) . It is often quite an unnerving experience attempting to hold your ground as a driver rushes past you in the opposite direction .
This also happens on a narrow street in the centre of Utrecht , which is a through-route for taxis , buses and delivery drivers .
I 've experienced close overtakes like this one almost every time I 've used this street .
And of course Dutch drivers will happily park on footways , on cycle lanes , and on cycle tracks when a suitable parking space is n't available , or nearby . Even obstructing junctions to do so .
This should n't come as a surprise . There 's nothing particular special about Dutch drivers . They will behave in anti-social ways like British drivers , and drive just as badly as them , when confronted with the same types of design .
All the familiar problems that people cycling in Britain encounter – close passes , squeezing through at pinch points , left hooks , and so on – would undoubtedly occur in the Netherlands too , on a large scale , if their roads were not designed to eliminate those kinds of problems from occurring in the first place .
Attempting to change the ‘ driving culture ' of Britain without changing the way roads are designed would be a futile experiment – we can see this in the way Dutch drivers behave on roads that put them into conflict with cycling , like the failed bicycle street in Utrecht in the 1990s , and countless examples of poor driver behaviour on ‘ British-style ' Dutch roads .
Smart pointers in C++ are nice , yet fraught with irregularities . One is the inability to create a proper clone function . This requires a feature called covariant return types , which C++ supports , but only for pointers . That sounds okay , but despite their name , smart pointers are not actually pointers .
Covariant return
A prototypical example of covariant return types is a clone method . Reasonably , we expect that a ‘ clone ' method returns the type on which it was called . It would n't make sense to call it ‘ clone ' if it could return an incompatible object type .
B * b = create_b ( ) ; //with covariant returns B * dup = b- > clone ( ) ; //without covariant returns B * dup = static_cast < B * > ( b- > clone ( ) ) ;
The above covariant call can be implemented as below . Here we see a derived class overriding the virtual function with a different return type . This is well defined so long as the return is a derived type .
class A { virtual A * clone ( ) ; } class B : public A { virtual B * clone ( ) ; } class C : public B { virtual C * clone ( ) ; }
The caller of clone is returned the same type without having to cast it . The virtual function still works as expected : if you have a ‘ B * ' to an object of type ‘ C ' , the ‘ C : :clone ' method will be called and its return cast to a ‘ B * ' . Beyond just a convenience , it is safer to have the compiler do this than rely on a ‘ static_cast ' . As code changes over time , one of those ‘ static_cast ' statements will inevitably perform an invalid cast .
Broken with shared_ptr
I consider ‘ shared_ptr ' to be a good option for general purpose object management . Unfortunately it is n't a real pointer . Only via a series of implicit conversion functions does it behave somewhat like a pointer . Weaknesses show up in many situations : covariant returns are one of them . It is not possible to code a ‘ clone ' function as expected .
struct A { virtual shared_ptr < A > clone ( ) { return make_shared < A > ( * this ) ; } } ; struct B : public A { shared_ptr < B > clone ( ) { return make_shared < B > ( * this ) ; } } ;
Covariant returns are restricted to true pointer types . The above code results in a compiler error . Using a ‘ smart_ptr ' requires returning the same type in all overrides of the virtual function . Using these non-covariant clone methods requires an unsafe cast .
shared_ptr < B > b = create_b ( ) ; //requires this unsafe syntax shared_ptr < B > ugh = static_pointer_cast < B > ( b- > clone ( ) ) ; //the preferred syntax shared_ptr < B > good = b- > clone ( ) ;
Using macros and/or other template techniques the overhead can be reduced somewhat . But it 's code I should n't have to write . Indeed , a minor error in one of my versions resulted in a hard-to-find defect . It 's a defect that happened because a new C++ feature , smart pointers , are effectively incompatible with a previous feature , covariant returns . I 'm in favour of new language features , but they should expand on previous features , not deprecate them . As it stands , a proper clone function using smart pointers can not be written .

MARK KARLIN , EDITOR OF BUZZFLASH AT TRUTHOUT
Call it a `` shameful '' statement , as Salon does , or call it contemptible and opportunistic , but Mitt Romney attacking Barack Obama for the US embassy deaths in Libya renders Romney unfit to be commander in chief .
“ It 's disgraceful , ” Romney 's Tuesday night campaign statement charged , “ that the Obama administration 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks . ”
In a news conference on Wednesday , Romney tripled down on the appeal to anti-Islamic sentiment by stating , before President Obama 's appearance , that `` The statement that came from the administration is akin to an apology . ''
The statement Romney is referring to was one made by the US embassy in Egypt before the killings in Libya . It was a diplomatic effort to dampen down isolated Islamic frenzy over a curiously timed promotion of an American Islamophobe YouTube video – and to stall the momentum of the protests .
According to the New York Times ,
The trigger for the anti-American outbursts was the amateurish , American-made video that opens with scenes of Egyptian security forces standing idle as Muslims pillage and burn the homes of Egyptian Christians . Then it cuts to cartoonish scenes depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a child of uncertain parentage , a buffoon , a womanizer , a homosexual , a child molester and a greedy , bloodthirsty thug .
The trailer was uploaded to YouTube by someone identified as Sam Bacile , whom The Wall Street Journal Web site described as a 52-year old Israeli-American real estate developer in California . They were quoted as telling the Web site they had raised $ 5 million from 100 Jewish donors to make the film . “ Islam is a cancer , ” Mr. Bacile was quoted as saying ..
Meanwhile , the right wing `` war against Islam '' contingent started fanning the flames to `` commemorate '' September 11th . Although no one can say for certain , it does appear curiously timed for an election day flare up , just as the Reagan campaign used the Iranian hostage crisis ( almost certainly negotiating with the revolutionaries there , through Willliam Casey representing the Reagan campaign , to delay release of the hostages until after the 1980 presidential election . )
What 's important to remember here , beyond Romney 's flame throwing opportunism , is that the statement Romney claims Obama apologized in -- which they did n't -- occurred before news of the killings were received by the White House . Yet , when questioned Wednesday morning by journalists about the timing of the original diplomatic statement ( which was trying to cool things down , we remind you ) , Romney basically said that it did n't matter .
This is consistent with the recent statement of a Romney campaign aide who said that facts would n't get in the way of the campaign ( paraphrased ) .
After Romney 's ignominious political theatrics of last night and this morning , President Obama appeared before the press at the White House .
They stated that `` Yesterday ( 9/11 ) was already a solemn day . '' Obama praised the diplomats who died and condemned the killings , as is appropriate . They acted entirely presidential in representing the digniity and mourning of the nation .
Romney will continue to repeat the lie about the original and diplomatically strategic foreign policy statement ( aimed at defusing the situation in Egypt ) because they are lashing about for some Hail Mary demagoguery to save their foundering campaign .
The cost of their irresponsible behavior may be an explosion in the Middle East .
WASHINGTON — It is our duty to demand ethical integrity from our presidents , and Donald Trump can not be allowed to make themselves an exception .
They are already trying hard to do so .
Amid the hustle and bustle of their transition , according to The New York Times , President-elect Trump found time last week for a visit from the Indian partners with whom they are developing a pair of residential towers in Pune , a sprawling city not far from Mumbai . And Trump received a congratulatory phone call from Argentine President Mauricio Macri , with whose father Trump had business dealings in the past . Trump and Macri denied published reports that Trump lobbied for an office building project they and a group of partners want to build in Buenos Aires .
Also , when Trump met last week with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , Trump 's daughter Related Articles Navarrette : 10 reasons why ‘ Beto ' O'Rourke bugs me
Letter : Answer to virtual oligarchy not ‘ economic democracy '

Political cartoons : Mueller investigation
Letter : California already quietly evolving to single-payer Ivanka was present . That raised eyebrows because Ivanka Trump , along with their brothers Donald Jr. and Eric , apparently will manage Trump 's business empire while they are in office . Trump 's lawyer called this arrangement a “ blind ” trust , but it is no such thing . Rather , it 's a way to use the presidency for the Trump family 's further enrichment .
The real and potential conflicts of interest are legion . The Washington Post reported that “ at least 111 Trump companies have done business in 18 countries and territories across South America , Asia and the Middle East ” and also places such as Canada , Scotland and Ireland .
We know that much — but very little more — from the financial disclosure documents Trump filed in May . We would know more had they not broken their promise to release their tax returns .
Some of Trump 's overseas developments are brick-and-mortar projects financed by big loans , often from foreign banks . Trump 's biggest lender , Germany 's Deutsche Bank , is negotiating a multibillion-dollar settlement with the Justice Department over abuses that contributed to the 2008 financial crash . Trump will soon be in charge of the Justice Department .
Some other foreign business dealings are basically licensing agreements for the use of the Trump brand . According to the Post , Trump 's company has been paid “ up to $ 10 million ” since 2014 for the right to put the Trump name atop a luxury apartment complex in Istanbul . The owner is an oil and media conglomerate closely allied with the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , who is conducting a brutal campaign of repression against their critics , including the independent Turkish media .
So when dealing with countries where they do business , will Trump put their own financial interests aside and do what is best for the United States ? “ We shall see ” is a far too generous answer . Based on what we have seen in the two weeks since the election , the answer is a simple no .
I might feel differently if Trump put their many businesses into a genuine blind trust — which would mean liquidating as many assets as possible and having the cash managed by an independent trustee . This is probably not practical ; their many partners in real estate deals would surely object , since the buildings would lose value once the Trump name was removed . But at the very least , Trump should have their empire managed by some eminent outsider who does not happen to be one of their children .
What does the law require ? Almost nothing .
As president , Trump is exempt from conflict-of-interest statutes . They must file an annual disclosure document listing assets and income but is not compelled to release their tax returns , though recent presidents have done so . There is no law that would keep Trump from continuing to run the Trump Organization while in office . ( Arguably , it might be better for them to spend time doing that than trying to deport 11 million undocumented migrants , take away health insurance from 20 million people , ban Muslims from entering the country and reinstitute torture for terrorism suspects . )
They do have to reckon with the emoluments clause of the Constitution , which bars public officials from receiving gifts from foreign governments without the consent of Congress . If stalled overseas projects suddenly get moving again after Trump is sworn in , that could be a problem .
Primarily , though , it is going to take public pressure to hold Trump accountable . Trump 's supporters should recall how they claimed the system was rigged and promised to “ drain the swamp. ” So far , they seem to intend to deepen the muck and make their fabulously wealthy family even wealthier .
How Trump handles their business interests must be seen as a simple test of their sincerity . So far they are failing miserably .

CINCINNATI ( July 28 , 2011 ) – The Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden 's newest exhibit featuring Cougars is set to open to the public Thursday , August 4 . The special exhibit , which is located just outside of the Zoo 's new attraction – Night Hunters – will be home to the Zoo 's two young Cougars , “ Tecumseh ” and “ Joseph , ” born September 19 , 2010 .
The new exhibit will allow visitors to see these amazing animals , up close and personal . The spacious display will depict the rocky habitats that cougars utilize in the wild , giving the brothers the opportunity to climb rocks and trees in addition to playing in a waterfall and splashing in a pool – which is one of their favorite pastimes – especially in these hot summer months !
Cincinnati Zoo trainers have been working with the brothers since they were eight weeks old , training them to use the new exhibit space to highlight their amazing natural abilities like stalking their prey and jumping large distances . Special demonstrations are planned at 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. daily , except Mondays and Thursdays , through Labor Day .
Also known as a Mountain Lion , Puma , or Panther , the cougar is the largest of the small cats . The World Conservation Union currently lists the cougar as “ least concern ” species . In the United States east of the Mississippi River , the only unequivocally known cougar population is the Florida panther . The United States Fish and Wildlife Service recognize both an Eastern cougar and the Florida panther , affording protection under the Endangered Species Act .
The completion of the new cougar exhibit has the Cincinnati Zoo one step closer to finalizing its larger Cat Canyon project . Cat Canyon will connect Night Hunters and cougars to a renovated tiger canyon , allowing visitors to see big cats as they have never seen them before . The final phase of the Cat-Canyon project will break ground next month and is scheduled to be open summer 2012 .

Some stamp dealers will sell you bulk quantities of old regular stamps at a discount from face value .
Tips for Getting Your Finances on the Right Track
Avoid debt . Most debt carries an interest rate , so not having debt will save you the interest payments .
Optimizing your tax withholding on your W-4 form can leave more money in your paycheck each month .
An online savings account often has a higher interest rate than one at a traditional bank . If you do n't mind the fact that there is no brick and mortar neighborhood location , consider putting some of your money into an online savings account whose interest rate can be several percent higher than one of a traditional bank .
Pay off your credit card debt . Paying it off is like saving because you wo n't have debt , and plus you wo n't lose money on interest payments .
When investing , you can invest in index funds instead of actively managed funds . It can save you a lot of money on fees , and many actively managed funds were found to not have much of a difference in gains from index funds .
Avoid banking fees . Shop around for the bank that has the lowest fees , or no fees at all . Getting something for free is always better than paying for it .
Make a budget , it will help you keep track of your expenses and help you eliminate unnecessary spending .

Baked goods can be gifts too .
Buy refill kits for ink cartridges , it 's cheaper than buying a new cartridge .
Adding improvements to your home like smoke detectors or burglar alarms can save you some money on your homeowners insurance .
Instead of stopping monthly payments when you pay off your car loan , keep making the payments into your savings account . It 's an easy way to save , and you can then use that money to buy your next car upfront or make a significant down payment and thus save money on paying interest on the loan .
Buy only what you really need .
You can go to dental schools to get something simple like a cleaning done , and it will often cost you little or no money .
Dryer sheets can be cut in half and still work fine , thus saving you money .

Wikimedia Commons Dexia SA , the Franco-Belgian mega-bank that collapsed and was bailed out in 2008 and that re-collapsed in early October , is a big deal in Belgium where it employs 10,000 people and has over 21 million bank accounts . Its assets of $ 715 billion dwarf Belgium 's $ 395 billion economy .
The three countries involved in the bailout agreed in October to guarantee €90 billion in loans , of which Belgium will be responsible for 60.5 % , France for 36.5 % , Luxembourg for 3 % . Belgium 's portion , €54.5 billion , represents nearly 14 % of its GDP . The process is moving forward . On December 21 , the European Commission approved on a temporary basis €45 billion of those guarantees though they violate EU rules on government subsidies for private companies .
Taxpayers are paying a heavy price for Dexia 's bailout . Belgium nationalized the Belgian entities of Dexia , including untold amounts of toxic assets . The French entity , which was involved in an enormous subprime scandal à la française , was taken over by the Caisse des Dépôts and the Banque Postale—both owned by the French government . Precision Capital , a Luxembourg company controlled by Qatari investors , bought 90 % of Dexia Bank International Luxembourg , valuing the firm at €730 million , a steep discount from the expected €1 billion . Luxembourg acquired the remaining 10 % . Other entities remain on the block .
In trying to bail out its financial sector , Belgium has guaranteed a total of €138.1 billion in debt ( 35 % of its GDP ) and has injected €15.7 billion in capital and €8.6 billion in loans , according to Belgium 's Cour des Comptes ( Audit Court ) , which released the results of its annual audit on December 20 ( PDF of the 412-page 168th Cahier ) . The largest recipients : Dexia Banque Belgique , Dexia SA , BNP Paribas , and Fortis Banque .
The ultimate costs to Belgian taxpayers will be huge and long-term , given how small the country is . Yet there have been no legal consequences for those responsible . Until now ....
Lynx Capital , a Belgian investment firm , has sued Dexia SA and former CEO Pierre Mariani for `` spreading false and misleading information '' and `` market manipulation . '' The amount in the case is small—and irrelevant . Lynx purchased 5,350 shares on September 5 , 2011 , for €1.46 per share and lost 82 % of its investment over the next few months . But in a potentially significant development for Belgium , where class-action law does n't exist , Bernard Delhez , CEO of Lynx , is now trying to encourage other shareholders to join the cause .
The complaint alleges that Mariani and Jean-Luc Dehaene , Dexia 's former president , issued reassuring statements about the financial condition of the bank from the time they took over , following its bailout in 2008 , until September 2011 . Because the bank was in a precarious situation throughout and engaged in high-risk activities , the information in those reassuring statements was false and misleading and was intended to artificially inflate Dexia 's share price . Hence , Dexia and Mariani engaged in market manipulation .
Moreover , Mariani must have known that the information was false and misleading . For example , Mariani confided in Dehaene in 2008 that Dexia was `` not a bank but a hedge fund '' ( L'Expansion ) . Dehaene spilled the beans on this conversation last October during the presentation of the breakup plan . Among the others reasons why Mariani must have known about the true condition of Dexia was a note that Luc Coene , Governor of the National Bank of Belgium , had sent to Dexia last August , in which they recommended that Dexia be dismantled .
For Robert Witterwulghe , Lynx 's lawyer , the facts demonstrate that Mariani knew as early as October , 2008 , that Dexia was in a precarious situation , and that the reassuring communications since then were willfully false and misleading .
The court action is based on the law of August 2 , 2002 , concerning insider trading and market manipulation . But : `` Why impose a system for everyone when it is not applied in certain cases ? '' Delhez said ( L'Echo ) , perhaps to justify in part why they are pushing the case though their investment is small and their legal expenses will pile up quickly .
When a bank collapses , the lies behind its financial statements come out of the woodwork—and Dexia is no exception : a report surfaced with the damning results of an earlier investigation by French regulators . And what happened then ? Nothing .... Regulators Knew of Dexia 's Problems But Were Silenced .
Image caption Israel says it sent troops into Gaza to try to put an end to Palestinian rocket fire
Two Israeli soldiers convicted of using a Palestinian child as a human shield during an offensive in Gaza in 2009 have received suspended sentences and been demoted .
The soldiers had forced the nine-year-old boy to open suspected booby-trapped bags at gunpoint .
It occurred during Israel 's three-week conflict with Hamas , which rules Gaza .
It was reportedly the first such conviction in Israel , where the use of civilians as human shields is banned .
An Israeli army spokesperson said the pair will be on probation for two years , AFP news agency reported .
During the soldiers ' trial in October , the boy , Majid Rabah , said they feared for their life .
`` I thought they would kill me . I became very scared and wet my pants , '' they said in an affidavit .
Majid Rabah 's mother , Fatma , criticised the sentence as too lenient .
`` It is completely unfair , because it was supposed to be more than this . Honestly , the fear that we felt in those moments , the fear that came after that and the negative side-effects to the child - [ the soldiers ] deserve more . ''
The soldiers ' lawyer , Ilan Katz , however , said the sentence was appropriate .
`` The fact that the court did n't decide to put the two accused in the prison speaks clearly that even the military court did n't think that in this case it was right to make a trial against the two soldiers because what they have done , they have done during a hard war when their life was under a big and serious danger . ''
Israel launched its offensive in December 2008 , it says , to stop Palestinian rocket fire .
Some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed during 22 days of fighting .

“ Does Crime Really Pay ? ”
By . Terrence Morrow
The UEE released its annual Crime Report this past week . With more and more people rejecting Citizenship and embracing the darker side of civilization , it raises the age-old question : does crime really pay ? When examined as a purely economic business venture , I would have to say , no .
There will always be exceptions , of course . The public eye has seen its share of infamous smugglers and pirates who have made a killing by defying the law . In my research , I learned that the true entrepreneurs of illegality are the ones who are n't notorious , who do n't get stories and Vids fictionalizing their adventures . They are the ones who you 've never heard of and , if they get their way , you never will .
This series of articles will ignore the exceptions and focus on what comprises almost ninety-eight percent of the research findings : the every-day working criminal .
While it 's true that the average criminal gets to avoid things like ever-increasing taxes and landing tariffs , guild dues and insurance that burden the legitimate community , you have to keep in mind that they are burdened with persistent expenses of their own :
Ship Repairs
Most haulers , shippers , and average Citizens do n't take kindly to having their livelihood stolen . Latest statistics estimate that eighty percent of bandit attacks lead to a battle of some kind . Since your livelihood depends on attacking others , odds are you are n't going to get out unscathed . Therefore , you can expect fairly regular trips to your mechanic . Which leads us to the illegal chop shops and patch-up joints around the systems that cater to the criminal element , clientele that wo n't want the usual paper trail or will require illegal modifications/repairs . One can expect a significant mark-up price-wise to do business with these types , if they do n't find more profit in shooting you and taking your ship for themselves .
Legal Fees
If you get caught , the amount of Creds needed to mount an average legal defense is pretty staggering . Since most people do n't dream of being dumped on a PrisonWorld , you 'll want to keep a defense fund handy .
Low Offload Prices
One could view theft as the ultimate risk/reward . If pulled off without a hitch , it 's all profit , right ? Sadly , the reality is much different . With cargo-tagging on the rise , it 's getting harder to move stolen merchandise so you either need to find a Buyer who 's willing to purchase stolen goods or a Fence who has the tech to re-tag the merch . Bottom line is that you will be getting well under market value for the goods , sometimes as much as 60 % less than it is worth in legitimate sale . It 's a buyer 's market out there . You 're the one in possession of stolen goods , not them .
Medical Costs/Dangers
Like your ship , the criminal lifestyle will put you in all sorts of life-threatening predicaments anything from injury sustained during a heist to the ‘ deal goes bad ' scenario . Whatever the reason , the odds are high that you will need to be patched up or have body parts replaced . Unfortunately , you ca n't just waltz into your local MedStation or CyberDoc without risking suspicious doctors and surveillance feeds to the Advocacy so you are left dealing with underground doctors who will cut you to the bone with medical costs and hush money .
The Price of Identity
The criminal life is like quicksand ; the more you ‘ work ' the easier it will be to catch you . For every ship you hit , your reputation will grow which means that more local cops will be looking for you . Eventually , the Advocacy will get involved . To stay ahead of them , you have to minimize your identity impression . That means building up a cache of fake ID tags . As you move from system to system , you need to know what identities have been used and when , if there 's a possibility that the tag has “ gotten dirty ” by being linked to one of your attacks .
Bribes
There will be times where you will need to ‘ grease some palms ' for information on shipping routes , cargo manifests , or for unscrupulous political and law enforcement to look the other way . As the UEE statutes on corruption and bribery carry stiff penal and financial penalties , the average criminal should be very careful when attempting to bribe someone regardless of whether it 's their first or fiftieth transaction .
Closing Statement
To me , it seems obviously that the financial strain of criminal endeavors feels vastly inferior to the potential rewards . Not to mention there is also the physical and psychological strain that existing in this world must have on your psyche .
Over the next few weeks , we will delve deeper into the world of the average criminal . Exploring each and every facet of what makes this world work , what draws in more and more men and women every year , and finally how one can hope to escape the whirlpool of the criminal lifestyle .
There 's binge watching and then there 's never watching at all .
A new study by Motorola Mobility claims that 41 % of the content recorded on DVRs in the United States is never watched and deleted . Worldwide , that stat is lower , at around 36 % .
Still that 's a significant number as networks increasingly want timeshifted viewing through DVRs , VOD and web-streaming platforms to be counted as part of Nielsen 's Live-plus-7 ratings measurement — or viewing captured within seven days of a program 's premiere telecast — when they broker deals with advertisers .
At the start of the fall TV season , 46 % of U.S. homes had a DVR , up 30 % over the previous year .
And that 's helped increase the amount of TV consumption , which is up 90 % around the globe this year to 19 hours , according to Motorola Mobility 's Fourth Annual Media Engagement Barometer .
The U.S. has the highest weekly TV consumption at 23 hours of TV and six hours of movies watched , while Sweden and Japan have the lowest at 15 hours and two hours , respectively , the study found .
Worldwide , 29 % of weekly TV viewing is recorded content , with 76 % of those surveyed saying they watch news broadcasts live .

More than 77 % of those surveyed said they record because there is other content airing at the same time , while 68 % globally record programming to skip ads . That percentage is higher in the U.S. ( 74 % ) and the U.K. ( 75 % ) . Another 72 % say they are hoarders , simply collecting TV programming on their set-top boxes .
The TV biz , of course , wants to turn more of those individuals into viewers .
But more recorded programming would be watched if it could easily be transferred to mobile devices like tablets and smartphones , Motorola Mobility found . That 's because tablet owners tend to watch more recorded content .
Around 80 % of a tablet user 's content is recorded , versus 65 % among non-tablet owners , according to the study . On average , tablet owners also watch 6.7 hours of movies a week versus the average of 5.5 of non-tablet owners .
“ Consumers want to be in control of the way they experience their videos , ” John Burke , senior VP and general manager of converged solutions at Motorola Mobility . “ Increasingly , they 're using tablets and smartphones to view [ and control ] content , and they expect this experience to transition seamlessly across their favorite programs , whenever and wherever they like . ”
Naturally , Motorola Mobility , owned by Google , has an interest in increased usage of mobile devices given that it makes Android smartphones and tablets , set-top boxes , DVRs and other devices that record or play video programming .
Motorola interviewed 9,500 consumers in 17 countries for its report .
Variety reports that Legendary Entertainment , the production company behind such films as Godzilla and Christopher Nolan 's Batman trilogy , has struck a deal to develop the 1993 adventure game Myst into a TV series . Although its largely static 3D graphics and slideshow-style navigation may seem quaint now , Myst was a phenomenon in its day . Sparked by widespread adoption of CD-ROM technology , Myst became the best-selling computer game of all time , a record that stood until The Sims surpassed it in 2002 .
If you 're not familiar with Myst , you might be wondering why such a big hit has n't been optioned for a movie or TV project before now . If you are familiar with Myst , you might be wondering how the hell Legendary will make a TV show out of it . Because the thing about Myst is there are n't any people around . You do catch glimpses of other characters , mostly through flickering videobook portals to strange realms , but you spend most of your time silently exploring beautiful , abandoned islands and solving the puzzles therein . So unless we 're going to watch a mute hero fiddle with the controls on a rocket ship 's pipe organ for an hour , the creators of this show will have to take a few liberties with the source material . The nature of those liberties remains to be determined , but Variety says that Myst creators Rand and Robyn Miller will be “ creatively involved ” in the show , potentially with a video game tie-in .

The controversy du jour deals with the high school girls and their tefillin , and it has prompted the usual litany of responses . Once again , what passes for psak in the Modern Orthodox world is little more than cherry-picking the sources to find the single , even strained , interpretation of a rabbinic opinion in order to permit what it wants to permit or prohibit what it wants to prohibit . The preponderance of poskim or the consensus in the Torah world matters little ; fables – like Rashi 's daughters wearing tefillin – carry more weight .
No honest reading of the sources could ever give rise to a statement such as “ Ramaz would be happy to allow any female student who wants to observe the mitzvah of tefillin to do so. ” Happy ? Tell it to the Rema or to the Aruch Hashulchan . And what about the prohibition of lo titgodedu ­– of not having contradictory practices in the same minyan ( e.g. , some girls wearing tefillin and others not ) ? And what of the statement being made to the traditional girls – that their service of G-d must somehow be inferior to that of their peers who are on a “ higher ” level , or the statement being made to all of them – women 's spirituality can only reach its peak when it mimics the religious practices of men ? I would not want my daughters to be exposed to either sentiment .
Frankly , it is unsurprising that many young students in high schools text on Shabbat , observe half-Shabbat , and the like . If the Mesorah can be manipulated to permit girls to do what they want , why ca n't it be manipulated to permit what boys want ? Clearly , the subtleties are being lost in translation . Would that the schools focused on enhancing the commitment of the boys and their tefillin than broadening it to include others who are not within the purview of the mitzvah .
And , like night follows day , the secular Jewish press – besides praising the courage of the administrators – have trumpeted this story as another sign of the feminization of Orthodoxy – a triumph of women 's rights in an age when those are considered some of society 's most cherished values . They perceive it as another sign that Orthodoxy is modernizing , getting with the times , and catching up with the non-Orthodox movements , to the chagrin of the troglodytes on the right who insist on impeding progress .
But what if that is not the story ? It is quite possible that we – and especially the media – might have missed the essence of this unfolding tale .
One question needs to be asked : do the girls here even define themselves as “ Orthodox Jews ? ” Upon information and belief , they do not , and I do not write this to impugn them in the least . The fact is that in these day schools , anywhere from 10-30 % of the student population consists of children from non-Orthodox homes . These families are proud members of non-Orthodox temples , and are certainly among the more dedicated . After all , they are sending their children to day schools under nominally Orthodox auspices . Some may even be the children of non-Orthodox rabbis , both males and females . When one girl explained that they have been wearing tefillin since their Bat Mitzvah , they are likely telling the truth . They have been wearing tefillin because that is part of the egalitarianism that is the most dominant value in the non-Orthodox world . If these girls – as it seems – are from non-Orthodox families , then the narrative has nothing at all to do with the so-called modernizing tendencies in Orthodoxy , but something else entirely .
The real story is not that Orthodox girls are wearing or want to wear tefillin , but that non-Orthodox children ( or their parents ) are essentially dictating to day schools how they want non-Orthodox practices incorporated – in school – in their children 's education . It is as if Conservative Judaism and its customs must be acknowledged much like schools have been known ( and properly so ) to allow children of the Edot Hamizrach to have their own minyanim and adhere to their own customs . And the schools are willing accomplices . Will they next remove their mechitzot to allow an egalitarian minyan , or is that too great a departure from the Orthodox brand ?
There was a time when non–Orthodox Jews were thankful that yeshivot accepted their children , but correctly assumed that the curriculum , standards , practices and ideology taught would conform to Torah . They knew it would differ from what they were being taught at home – but they wanted that .
There was a time when a yeshiva administration had the authority and the courage to insist on those standards . Times have changed . In the competition for the tuition dollar of the non-Orthodox – and the fact is that SAR and Ramaz are competing for the same students – accommodations have to be made . And that is a travesty . Masquerading under the convenient narrative that this is a war for the soul of Modern Orthodoxy is the inconvenient reality : the inmates are running the asylum . The administrators are either unable or unwilling to maintain a complete fidelity to Jewish tradition , for at least some of their constituents are demanding otherwise .
Does a boy in such a school then have the right to say : “ I do not feel that my divine service requires me to wear a kippa . My father does n't , not even in the house . I am against your religious coercion ” ? Should a school tolerate that ? Or , an even better question : could a boy say that they reject wearing tefillin until all the girls do ? I.e. , they are such an advocate of egalitarianism that it would be unconscionable for him , coming from their background , to continue to propagate the school 's antiquated , misogynistic , patriarchal attitudes that discriminate between males and females . I can hear it now : “ There is only one G-d . They created all of us , and so there should be one law for all of us ! ” I wonder how the administrators would respond to that ; probably , quite uncharitably , but on what grounds ?
As one male SAR student asked me this week : if girls can be obligated when they are really exempt , why ca n't they be exempt when they are really obligated ? The logic is not impeccable – they are only 16 years old – but begs the question : if the Mesorah is so ephemeral that it can change on a whim , why ca n't any rabbi make any change that they want to make ? Why ca n't a layperson ?
Add to this one other point . I personally have met a number of graduates of these schools who are children of non-Orthodox female converts who were never informed by the administrators that the conversions were not acceptable according to halacha . In effect , they went through high school thinking they were Jews like all their classmates only to discover – years later and often on the verge of marriage – that they were not considered Jewish . The tragedy is heart-wrenching , because these young men and women are pure innocents . But there are halachic ramifications as well even while they are in school : Did the son of such a female convert lein in school ? Was they motzi the audience with their Chazarat Hashatz ? Did they count for the minyan ?
Take a more tragic example : what if a young girl , child of a non-Orthodox converted mother , meets and falls in love with a male classmate ( perhaps , their chavruta in Gemara class ) , and that young man is a kohen ? What would have been a beautiful relationship is now marred forever and their life plans have to be altered . Perhaps , G-d forbid , the couple might then even turn away from Torah observance entirely because the young woman in question also needs to convert according to halacha , but now can not marry this young kohen . Is the unequivocal acceptance of non-Orthodox converts and their children the norm in these schools ? Is any attempt made to have them – if possible – convert according to halacha ? I wonder .
On some level , the policy makes internal sense . For a day school appealing for non-Orthodox students in a very competitive climate , questioning the legitimacy of non-Orthodox conversions would be a turn-off to parents – just like denying these girls their tefillin would displease future applicants as well . We can debate whether these policies are l'shem shamayim or l'shem mammon ; it is probably a bit of both .
But the bottom line is that the story here might not be at all about “ Orthodox ” girls wearing tefillin but about non-Orthodox children seeking accommodation of their religious practices , and about day school principals reluctant to insist on adherence to Torah standards . And that is the opposite of courage .

News from the Trust Dear % FirstName % Here is the full text of a statement which has been issued by The Trust this evening . 'As outlined in previous statements to our members , the Supporters Trust can confirm that discussions have continued between the Supporters Trust , senior management of the football club and representatives of the new majority owners . The Supporters Trust can confirm that our new Supporter Director , Stuart McDonald , has started to engage with the senior management of the football club , and we hope to see that relationship develop over the coming weeks . The Supporters Trust was yesterday surprised to note that , according to Companies House records , Leigh Dineen had been reappointed as a Director of the football club . However , after discussions overnight between the Supporters Trust and the new majority owners , it was identified that the appointment was made without approval and has now been removed . It has been agreed that the issue of Leigh Dineen 's position at the club would be discussed at next month 's board meeting , which our Supporters Director will be attending . Discussions have also continued between representatives of the Supporters Trust and Jason Levien regarding the outstanding issues surrounding the ownership structure of the football club , it being crucial to the Supporters Trust that meaningful protections are guaranteed by the majority owners in order to secure the Trust 's shareholding and influence at the football club . While significant progress has yet to be made in this area , discussions will continue to determine whether a resolution can be found . An alternative line of discussion has related to a potential partial sale of the Trust shareholding , in order to protect the Trust against any future share issue which could potentially dilute the Trust 's shareholding . Such a share sale could also act as a “ nest egg ” to protect the football club in case of future financial issues or also further the Trust 's aims of bringing the football club closer to the community . Unfortunately , Jason Levien has confirmed that the new majority owners have no plans to make an offer at this time for all , or part , of the shareholding of the Supporters Trust . It is our belief that the interests of all parties should be the same – to see a well-run , solvent , community focused football club continue to grow and succeed in the Premier League . Any actions taken by the Supporters Trust , with the approval of our Members , will be with that goal in mind . Therefore , in order to best protect the interests of the Supporter Trust and its members , the Trust will be looking at alternative options . Whilst discussions will continue with the new majority owners , the Supporters Trust will also be engaging with a number of other parties to determine whether there are partnership opportunities worth pursuing . Discussions will need to remain confidential until completed , however we will continue to keep our members up to date as new information can be shared . In parallel , the Supporters Trust will continue to review and progress any legal options open to us . We are conscious that any legal action would create uncertainty , not just in terms of its success , but also our relationship with the new owner and the likelihood of destabilising the football club . This remains a last resort , however we ultimately have a duty to our members and the best long-term interests of the fans . As previously outlined , if any decisions are to be taken regarding legal action or the Trust 's shareholding in the football club , this would require the full approval of the Trust members via a fans forum or ballot ' Thanks for your continuing support

When Sascha Meinrath saw the Occupy encampment in D.C. , they saw something few others would – a testbed for technology .
Meinrath has been chasing a dream for more than a decade , ever since they were a liberal arts grad student in Urbana , Illinois : community wireless networks . From that small beginning , Meinrath now runs a State Department-funded initiative to create an Internet in a Suitcase – the Voice of America of the digital age .
If they have their way , Meinrath 's project will lead to low-cost , easy-to-use wireless connections around the globe , all lashed together in mesh that can withstand the whims of dictators willing to pull the plug on the internet to quash dissent . They and a team of software engineers are developing open-source software to turn cheap wireless access points and Android smartphones into nodes on the network , which could then be used by dissidents to evade censorship and to spread low-cost connections everywhere around the world . Proponents of the plan include the U.S. State Department , which has given Meinrath a $ 2 million grant to develop the code .
`` This started due to massive naiveté , '' said Meinrath , whose official title is Director of the New America Foundation 's Open Technology Initiative . `` I had no idea of the complexity of solving these problems . ''
Before getting funding , Meinrath and their team of collaborators had been building various community networks for years , including a post-Katrina emergency connection network that spanned three states . Community wireless networks in the U.S. have generally failed to find acceptance , but massive scale networks are possible , says Meinrath , pointing to examples in Spain and Greece which are home to networks with thousands of nodes .
With the emergence of an Occupy encampment in the nation 's capital , Meinrath found a nearly perfect testbed for the pre-alpha software – the site is weather-challenged , and full of internet-hungry individuals constantly trying to update social networking sites and make their own media . Exactly like what happened in the Arab Spring .
The Internet in a Suitcase project is based off a simple plan : create software that 's easy to install and use on cheap hardware which will seamlessly connect to any other access point around it , creating a shared local network .
The custom software is called Commotion . It will work with Android phones and with routers that support custom firmware , like Ubiquiti Networks ' low-cost , carrier-grade wireless access points . `` The firmware provides auto-configuration capabilities , '' said Brian Duggan , one of the engineers on the Internet in a Suitcase project , `` so you do n't need to be an engineer '' to install it . `` You flash as many nodes as you want , or pick up previous ones . ''
The idea is that the system will automatically set itself up . Drop a unit near another unit and they 'll start talking to one another and trading data . Add another and all three will talk to one another . Add a thousand and you can cover a whole city . Then if one of those routers is hooked up to an internet connection , everyone on the network can connect . If that connection disappears , users can still try to update an application like Twitter or send e-mail to the larger internet and the outgoing notes will go into a holding pattern until the mesh network finds another connection to the greater net .
That 's harder to pull off in practice , even under ideal conditions – as anyone who 's tried to link even two Wi-Fi access points in their own home could attest . Now throw in the variables that the access points should work in urban and exposed environments , as well as protest zones like Tahir Square . You 'll want to protect dissidents with encryption and deniability . And you do n't want your beta-testers to be arrested or even killed because of a software bug . All together it 's the kind of challenge engineers like to call `` non-trivial '' .
`` Finding a place to use the system is difficult , '' Meinrath said . `` Thank God for the Occupy movement . ''
So over the last few weeks , Meinrath 's staff have tried to wire up Occupy DC with a few custom-flashed wireless nodes hooked up to the network via radio link to a nearby office 's donated business connection .
But please do n't take it as an endorsement of Occupy DC 's politics , Meinrath says .
`` We hope the Tea Party will launch a sleep-in and we can hit both ends of the political spectrum , '' they said .
Right now , the project 's software is in `` pre-release '' form , though it 's seeped into the wild at Occupy DC . You can find one router in the media tent at in downtown McPherson Square , which is home to about 200 protesters .
The Media Tent is built out of a bunch of tarps , with another tarp separating the tent into two rooms . There 's a graffiti-lined front door – an actual door – that is hinged to nothing , a cheeky joke , since you get in by lifting the tarps . Inside is a mess – there 's an office chair with ripped upholstery , milk crates and ladders strewn about and a few tables for desks . The park ground is the floor , augmented by some cardboard and wood planks .
The Internet in a Suitcase hardware is a white Ubiquiti router the size of a couple Snickers bars . It hangs from the makeshift ceiling and is not noticeable unless you look for it .
To use it , you plug one end into the wall , another into a bandwidth source , and you 're to be good to go . In theory . In practice , the test at Occupy DC is drawing at best mixed reviews from protesters , who say the technology is difficult to configure , install and use .
`` It 's definitely a work in progress , '' said Kelly Mears , who seems to be the head of tech for Occupy DC and looks remarkably like Mark Zuckerberg , albeit in a skinny brown tie and cardigan instead of a hoodie . `` It 's not exactly point and click . I 'm looking at a terminal window , on Linux . ''
Kenny , another of Occupy DC 's tech people , is also slightly unimpressed , though not critical of the New America team . They push a Dell laptop in a baby stroller to livestream a protest in the occupied McPherson Square 's central square , in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street eviction . The laptop is notably hooked up to a commercial Clear Wi-Fi hotspot .
`` The signal strength [ of Commotion ] is poor . … The service itself has been shitty . That 's why we 're using Clear , '' Kenny said .
The signal strength starts conking out when you walk the roughly 50 feet from the media tent to the center of the square . There are typically 3 or 4 laptops from the media team simultaneously using Commotion – its not clear how many other devices are also taxing the system . It does n't help that there 's a single connection to the net – a 1 Mbps connection at that – which is linked to by a long range antenna . That kind of connection is thin for livestreaming , even for one person in ideal conditions .
Josh King , the technical lead on the project , is excited , even if the protesters are n't .
`` It 's software under development , '' King said . `` This is a great opportunity to test it , to get this kind of feedback and make changes in real time . ''
`` It 's a real test bed , '' adds Meinrath . `` We 're getting the good , bad and ugly ... It 's not as stable as we would like , but we 're working in real world where we do n't have optimum anything . It 's a pre-alpha release providing connectivity to several hundred people . ''
The team is working to augment its internet bandwidth with backhaul from the AFL-CIO and the ACLU . The latter would be ideal , Meinrath says , because it 's unlikely that law enforcement would try to subpoena the ACLU 's connection to spy on protesters .
But for now Meinrath is happy with the test .
When , or if , the team figures out how to build a point-and-click internet in a box , they hope it 'll become a platform that developers can build smart and safe apps on .
Meinrath points to Frank Legendre 's work on what 's known as disaster mode for Twitter ( download it at Twimight ) as an example of what an app built for such a network could look like .
`` You could have a delay-tolerant Twitter , where people on the local network could see your tweets and then when a connection is restored it could get pushed to the internet , '' Meinrath said . `` We are in the very infancy of this kind of intranet . ''
That 's still a dream that 's a long way off . But Meinrath 's project is not alone . Another community wireless group in Europe won a $ 5 million grant to work on implementing such networks , complementing their group 's emphasis on research and development .
Meinrath thinks it 's just a matter of time now before mesh networks become a fact of life for most of the world – in particular the two-thirds of it that are n't high-income nations .
`` Those initial years of having a very utopian but pragmatic vision of connectivity for everyone is still driving this project , '' Meinrath said . `` Twenty-first century statecraft is aligned with those goals . It 's nice to have Hilary on your side . ''

CHANGING engine oil is a messy business in more ways than one . Every year , despite the various recycling schemes available , Americans pour over 200m US gallons ( 750m litres ) of used engine oil into trash cans , onto land or down the drain . Most of this ends up polluting rivers and streams . The job could become much faster , simpler and cleaner , though , with a new invention : a plug-in oil cartridge that takes around 90 seconds to replace .
Nexcel , as it is known , is a sealed unit that contains both oil and oil filter , along with some electronics to communicate with the host car 's engine-management system . An oil change begins by selecting the vehicle 's service mode , which tells the engine 's oil pump to transfer oil in the sump into the cartridge . That can then be unclipped and swapped for a new one which contains fresh oil and a clean filter .
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor 's Picks .
The idea comes from Castrol , the lubricants division of BP , a large British oil company . Castrol says a Nexcel cartridge should cost about the same as a conventional oil change , but will be better in several ways . It will , for example , be able to monitor the condition of the oil more closely and ensure it is replaced in a timely fashion . It will also let an engine warm up to its most efficient operating temperature more quickly because , when the engine is started , the cartridge pumps into the sump only the minimum amount of oil needed to let it run smoothly . This may sound risky , but it is a system already used in the “ dry sump ” engines of many high-performance cars . In fact , the first vehicle to use Nexcel is a dry-sump Aston Martin Vulcan , a car made for the racetrack .
Apart from quick oil changes and rapid engine warming , the main benefits of Nexcel would be environmental . Although garages collect oil for recycling , different grades often get mixed together and other substances , such as brake fluid , may find their way into the tank as well . As a result , much exhausted oil ends up burnt as furnace fuel rather than being reprocessed as lubricants . According to Oliver Taylor , the Nexcel project 's chief engineer , employing cartridges could increase the amount of oil thus reprocessed from the current figure of around a tenth , to three-quarters . The cartridges can be cleaned and reused , too .
The main problem with Nexcel is that engine layouts will need to be redesigned to accommodate the cartridge . That is not insuperable , but might require Castrol 's proprietary layout to become a more open system which others can copy ( perhaps for a royalty ) , for no carmaker will want to be tied to the product of a single firm . Castrol is discussing this with manufacturers , and hopes the first Nexcel-fitted vehicles will appear in about five years ' time .
Police are investigating a Reddit post claiming to offer the murder suspect 's perspective in the death of Melinda Vasilije , a 22-year-old who was found stabbed at their apartment in Kitchener , Ont .
The post was written under the Reddit username Redasblue101 , by an individual claiming to be 24-year-old Ager Mohsin Hasan . Hasan is currently the subject of a joint Canada-U.S. manhunt in connection with Vasilije 's death .
Waterloo police found Vasilije dead from multiple stab wounds at their apartment on Apr . 28 , after responding to a 911 call at approximately 3 a.m. Hasan is thought to have crossed into the United States hours later , where they were last seen switching the plates on their vehicle for Pennsylvania plates .
`` At this point , we believe that Ager Hasan is responsible for the death of Melinda Vasilije , '' Waterloo Police Insp . Mike Haffer said at a news conference on Tuesday . Haffer said police are currently working with U.S. law enforcement agencies to find Hasan . They also encouraged the suspect to turn themselves in so they can be extradited to Canada to face charges .
Haffner said Hasan and Vasilije had been dating for approximately one year , and that the alleged murder was a `` targeted incident . ''
In the Reddit post claiming to tell Hasan 's side of the incident , user Redasblue101 says they fled to the United States `` to give myself some space and fully take in what happened before I turn myself in . ''
Redasblue101 claims they went to Vasilije 's apartment on the night of their death to work out their relationship problems with her , after the two broke up a few weeks prior .
In addition to a second-degree murder charge , Hasan is wanted on three breach of recognisance charges , which stem from a previous altercation at Vasilije 's home in on Apr . 3 .
`` He allegedly committed a break-and-enter and two counts of assault , '' Haffner said at the news conference on Tuesday . They added that Vasilije was not a victim in the alleged assaults .
Haffner 's description lines up with Redasblue101 's post , in which they say they got into a `` physical altercation '' with the brother and boyfriend of Vasilije 's roommate that night . The user claiming to be Hasan says that was the night they and Vasilije initially broke up over text message , and that they had gone to their house from their home in Hamilton to work things out .
Haffner says Hasan was arrested that night and released on the condition that they not enter the region of Waterloo or have any contact with Vasilije .
The post claiming to tell Hasan 's `` side '' of the story was written on Tuesday and removed a few hours later . However , a version of it still exists in Google 's cache .
Hasan was last seen on Apr . 28 in Pennsylvania , where they were driving a black 2016 Honda CRV .
`` The information we have right now is they are somewhere in the United States , '' Haffner said .
Police say they are confirming the authenticity of the post . None of the allegations have been tested in court .

The current probability that Boston , Massachusetts will break the 1995-1996 historical record for most snow in one season is 75 % .
Problem Framing . Given that Boston has accumulated 105.7 inches of snow as of March 4 , what is the chance that the 2014-2015 snow season will break the 1995-1996 historical record ( a whopping 107.6 inches ! ) for most snowfall in one season ?
Methods . To match or break the record , Boston would need to accumulate another 1.9 inches or more between March 5 , 2015 and the end of April 2015 . In order to assess the likelihood of this occurring , monthly snowfall data for Boston , Massachusetts from the Logan Airport weather station were collected . Data were available from 1920 to 2014 ( N = 95 ) . The amount of snow that accumulated between March 5 and April 30 for every year between 1920 and 2014 was then calculated using the following expression :
Note : This expression assumes that the expected snow fall on any given day of March is uniform across the entirety of the month . Because daily snowfall data are not readily available , this assumption allows us to make the calculations necessary to address the question of interest .
Results . Boston accumulated more than 1.9 inches of snow between March 5 and April 30 in 71 of the 95 years ( ~75 % ) on record . Thus , the likelihood that Boston will accumulate another 1.9 inches of snow before the end of the 2014-2015 snow season and break the 1995-1996 historical record is ~75 % .
Reporting from Milan -- I 've noticed a pattern over the last eight seasons covering the men 's runway collections : The quality of the opening laser light show is inversely proportional to that of the collection that immediately follows it .
And , on Monday , Versace put on one hell of a light show .
Explicitly drawing inspiration from `` Tron '' ( yes , the 1982 Walt Disney film `` Tron , '' why do you ask ? ) , and William Gibson 's 1984 novel `` Neuromancer , '' ( which popularized a now-familiar word of Gibson 's coinage -- `` cyberspace '' ) , it seemed to be just as heavily influenced by `` Terminator '' and the dispersive prism album cover art of Pink Floyd 's `` Dark Side of the Moon . ''
Clearly there had been no small amount of technical fiddling to get the fashions of the future off the ground ; one jacket looked like it had been shaped out of crumpled aluminum foil , which might have made it a wacky , cool concept piece if that 's what the designers used . Instead it required ( as the show notes explained ) `` fur dipped in a proprietary dye to resemble silver foil . ''
And , also according to the notes , luminescent fiberglass played a supporting role -- something about adding brilliance to the chalk stripes .
There were folded , darted leather jackets , leather bags and jackets that looked as if they had been studded with ball bearings , and wool felt trousers and jacket lapels coated to a mirror-like finish with polyurethane ( which basically made it look like ... you guessed it , patent leather ) .
Perhaps this was Versace 's `` Tron '' collection -- only in reverse . In 28 years we could look back and laud this as the collection that employed all kinds of cutting-edge innovation to change the game forever .
But on Monday , it looked a lot more like Bruce Boxleitner zipping around on a light cycle wearing head-to-toe CGI neon .

Stores are n't even waiting for Black Friday this year to kick off the holiday-sale madness , but there are some things shoppers should keep in mind before they scarf their turkey and hit the sales . Retailers rely heavily on Black Friday to boost their sales figures , more so today in a lackluster economy . That means their usual tricks will be deployed , like jaw-dropping prices on items available in such limited quantities that it 's almost inevitable you 'll have to settle for a more expensive alternative . But that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
Stores are getting increasingly savvy at finding ways to get you to break out your credit card while making you feel like you 've scored the steal of a century . But if you would n't believe in one-of-a-kind , once-in-a-lifetime deals in March or May , you should n't let your guard down now . Here are six things you should keep in mind during the holiday shopping season .
( MORE : Black Thursday : Will Shoppers Really Show Up at Stores on Thanksgiving Night ? )
1 . MSRPs are meaningless . A lot of Black Friday deals tout huge percentages off the “ manufacturer 's suggested retail price , ” but these can be misleading . MSRPs and non-sale prices can vary from retailer to retailer , or the retailer may even list a higher MSRP than what 's on the manufacturer 's own website . In some cases , stores will already have the item in question for sale below the stated MSRP .
An example : Kohl 's Black Friday flier advertises an 18-piece set of Cuisinart knives for $ 59.99 , down from a “ regular ” price of $ 169.99 . But a shopper on Kohl 's website now can get those knives for $ 119.99 . The Black Friday price is still cheaper , but it 's not as good a deal . The Cuisinart website indicates that the knives are n't available directly from the manufacturer but are sold through Kohl 's . It lists the price at $ 99.99 . Plugging the model number into Google also turns up the same knife set at a handful of other retailers , priced in the $ 90 to $ 100 range without any special sale .

2 . You might have to mail in a rebate to get the deal . Many stores advertise fat Black Friday discounts , then mention in small print below the eye-catching numbers that you have to mail in a rebate to get the deal . Here 's the thing : You probably wo n't . According to an academic research paper titled , “ Managing Mail-in Rebate Promotions , ” only about 40 percent of rebates on consumer electronics get redeemed , and the rate is even lower for other categories . The paper says , “ As explained by one retailer , ‘ Manufacturers love rebates because redemption rates are close to none . They get people into stores , but when it comes time to collect , few people follow through . And this is just what the manufacturer has in mind . ' ”
What 's more , the fine print on a lot of the Black Friday ads stipulates a maximum of one rebate per item , per address . So if you want to buy two friends or family members the same gift , you could be out of luck if you have to fill out a rebate to score the sale . ( Plus , this means you 'll have to give a gift with the UPC code cut out of the box , or else ask the recipient to save the bar code for you . )
3 . Applying for a store credit card could backfire . Stores use Black Friday to sign up new accountholders for their branded credit cards , often by dangling an extra 15 or 20 percent discount as incentive for doing so . But that discount is n't free ; it 's shaving points from your credit score , which could cost you big-time if you plan to take out a loan in the near future .

The first way your score is impacted is by the inquiry into your credit the merchant makes when you apply . While a shopper with a long credit history might only see their score dip by a few points , “ Someone with a young credit report might see their score drop 15 to 20 points , ” warns John Ulzheimer , president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com . Adding new accounts lowers the average age of your accounts , which also lowers your score . Ulzheimer says that for people with short credit histories , the addition of a new account could drop their score by 20 to 30 points . “ Opening several retail cards to take advantage of several discounts will compound the damage , ” they add .
4 . That doorbuster might not be the “ real ” thing . Some products advertised at deep discounts on Black Friday are what 's known as “ derivative products ” — items made by the same manufacturer that look almost like the standard model but with a few very important differences . Consumer Reports highlighted derivative electronics in a 2009 investigation and found that these products are generally manufactured more cheaply , sometimes with less-expensive components , and that they are generally missing a few features present on the standard models . The magazine says big-name companies like Sony and Samsung have made derivative TVs in previous years ; we 've seen laptop and printer deals from brands like HP in this year 's Black Friday ads that appear to be derivatives , as well .
How can you tell if you 're getting a derivative or not ? The model number is often a tipoff ; it will be slightly different . Or just do an online search for the model number to see if distribution is limited to a single retailer , which could indicate that it 's a product made specifically for that company in order to meet a doorbuster price .
5 . You can get some of those deals now . Sometimes , you can do better — even at the same retailer — without waiting for Black Friday . This year 's Black Friday ad from Staples includes an 8GB flash drive made by SanDisk for eight bucks , but it 's currently available on the Amazon.com marketplace for as little as half that . This item also falls into the “ useless regular price ” category ; the Black Friday ad says the regular price is $ 29.99 , but you can buy a 16GB version of the same flash drive for $ 19.99 on Staples ' website , and the 8GB model is available at numerous other places for well below the $ 30 price point .
6. Credit card price protection can help you — sometimes . If you buy a product and then find it on sale somewhere else within a certain time frame ( generally 60 days ) , see if you qualify for the lower price . Your first line of defense should be the store at which you bought the now-cheaper item . Bring a copy of the ad , since some stores will reimburse you the difference on the spot . If not , document the lower price and get in touch with your credit card company .
Some credit cards come with a price matching guarantee , although the degree to which this will help your Black Friday retail adventures is limited . Verbiage in price protection terms and conditions spells out pretty specifically that the protection wo n't apply for sales in which the retailer advertises a limited supply . The rules are a little blurrier when it comes to Black Friday deals that last for a very short window of time but do n't warn about limited supply . “ It all depends on how a retailer would word this , ” says a spokesperson from Capital One . In other words , it 's worth looking into .
Most custom motorcycles fit within a particular genre . And that genre will have its own conventions , as well as its fans and detractors . But occasionally you see a bike that is utterly timeless , almost beyond ‘ classic ' . And this is one of them , from the New Hampshire workshop of Walt Siegl .
“ I was hoping to create a motorcycle that has the charm of the big roadsters from the 60s and 70s , ” says Walt , “ but with modern performance . I also wanted to build a bike that does n't require too much maintenance and technical expertise to keep on the road . ”
The FX Roadster started out as a beat-up 1970 Harley FLH . “ I always liked the look of the shovelhead engine . And the aftermarket offers so many good choices for updated mechanicals—you can build a really strong motor/transmission combo. ” So Walt enlisted Andrew Rosa of Rosa 's Cycles on Long Island to rebuild the engine and transmission : “ Over the years I 've had quite a few motors built by Andrew , and their work is the best I have come across , ” says Walt .
The motor is an 84-inch stroker with balanced flywheels , lightweight pistons , a performance cam and worked heads that flow better than stock . And the transmission is now filled with gears that have better ratios for acceleration and highway speed .
“ That combo has all the rewarding bravado of a big vintage twin , ” says Walt . “ Torque is everywhere . It 's reliable and you can throw dust at guys on machines that come from a more modern world. ” All the primary parts are by Tech Cycle , with a smooth and strong operating diaphragm clutch in a lightweight aluminum clutch basket , a two-inch belt drive , and a quiet electric starter .
Walt reworked the Harley frame and reduced the rake by two degrees . They added a frame loop in the back and a new swing arm for better steering . “ Most Harley swing arms point upwards , and some owners also add rake and fork length . That 's a big reason why the bikes handle like tanks . ”
Walt filled the 39mm Showa forks with Progressive Suspension springs and performance sliders . Works Performance helped Walt with the rear suspension , providing shocks that gave them the ride height they were after , without sacrificing performance and comfort .
The rims are high-shoulder Excels , fitted with Buchanan stainless spokes , and the brake calipers are modern-era Harley units with semi-floating rotors . A heavily altered Benelli tank and straight bench seat , upholstered by Vivian Smith , give the bike a classic profile .
The FX Roadster is perhaps the motorcycle that Harley should have built forty years ago—a machine to compete with the Ducatis , Nortons and BMWs of the day , not to mention the Japanese makers . That never happened , but thanks to master craftsmen like Walt , we can say ‘ Better late than never ' .
If their Harley FLH tickles your fancy , contact Walt via their website—it 's for sale .

I 'm working on the final steps to close my Condo and I asked myself , “ Should I Overpay My Mortgage ? ” Right now rates are incredibly low and prices are super cheap so while I do plan to do a lot of living in this Condo , in 3-4 years I would like to rent it out .
Just to bring you up to speed , these are the numbers I 'm working with :
Sale price : $ 321,000
Down payment : 20 % ( $ 64,200 )
Mortgage value : $ 256,800
Interest rate : 3.375 %
Term : 30 years
Total interest paid over term : $ 151,909
That 's quite a lot of money going to interest ! Traditional thinking is to overpay and avoid as much extra interest as possible on your mortgage . That 's definitely a valid approach ( and better than spending that money on donuts ) , however I think it 's actually a pretty high risk with a fairly low return . Let me explain why .
Overpaying Your Mortgage Is Probably A Bad Deal !
If I were to overpay my mortgage I would achieve two things over the course of the year . I reduce the interest I pay by 3.375 % of the amount I overpay over 30 years and I reduce the length by my mortgage accordingly .
First of all I think 3.375 % is a pretty low bar for investment gains . Sure the total interest I pay seems like a lot but over 30 years we can decimate that with boring average stock market returns .
The average stock market return over the past 30 years is 10 % . If I invested $ 5,000 every year over the course of my mortgage I would have roughly $ 950,000 in stock market gains and that 's with a no effort investment strategy .
After I subtract the interest I would have paid on my mortgage in that time , I 'm still left with a net gain of $ 798,000 ( $ 950k market gains – $ 152k mortgage interest ) . That 's pretty awesome ! If I focused on paying my mortgage back early the maximum gains I could get is the interest I pay on my mortgage , $ 152,000 . That 's weak and we can do better .
Second and arguably more important , is that my money wo n't be locked up in my property . Say I need cash due to an unforeseen problem , I would have to sell my condo to get access to that cash or take out a loan . We all know that the most optimistic estimations put either of those at longer than 30 days ! That 's a really long time , especially when most equities can cash out in 1-3 days .
What if my condo burnt to the ground ? If most of the money is the bank I can sleep easy but if it 's locked up in the Condo I 'm royally screwed until I get the insurance payout . Even then I 'm likely to get around 80 % of its actual worth after I fight with my insurance company . As they say , cash is king !
Take The Free Money !
Even with crazy restrictions , banks will let us use up to 40 % of our monthly take home on housing payments , even though we probably should n't go that high ! The easiest way to reduce the impact of a second mortgage is to rent your first property . Mortgage companies will let you use 80 % of the rent you receive on your first property as additional income to help you receive more overall funding and reduce the percent you spend overall on housing .
Let someone else pay your first mortgage with their rent . Step on the gas and race faster down the road to financial independence !
In meetings over the last nine months , advocates for hepatitis patients have urged the Obama administration to issue guidance to state Medicaid directors on appropriate coverage of the new drugs , but federal officials have been noncommittal .
“ States have flexibility to determine the best way to manage their Medicaid benefits , including drug benefits , ” said J. Timothy Gronniger , a senior official at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who worked at the White House until recently .
Other administration officials said they wanted to ensure access to the new hepatitis drugs , but also had to consider the financial effect on the federal government , which pays at least half of the cost for Medicaid patients in every state .
Moreover , federal officials said they were being cautious because any directives for Medicaid coverage of hepatitis drugs could set a precedent affecting new drugs for other conditions , and many expensive drugs are in the pipeline .
The administration of President Bill Clinton took a more aggressive stance in 1996 , when states were limiting access to a new generation of potent but costly drugs for H.I.V . and AIDS .
The Clinton administration told state Medicaid directors that they had to cover the new AIDS drugs , known as protease inhibitors . States could impose certain limits on use of the drugs , but the limits must not “ excessively or unreasonably restrict coverage of effective treatments ” for people with H.I.V . and AIDS , the Clinton administration said .
Cindy Mann , the top federal Medicaid official from 2009 to January of this year , said there was “ an increasing consensus among health care professionals ” about the circumstances in which the new hepatitis drugs should be provided . But this consensus is not reflected in state policies , they said , so the federal government “ needs to provide some guidance and clarification ” to states .
IT 'S a brutal catch 22 .
A man wants to demonstrate their affection by opening a few doors or offering up their coat and is consequently labelled a well-meaning sexist .
That is the message from a study published this week in the journal Sex Roles , conducted by psychologists at Northeastern University in Boston . While it was small in size , the study is believed to be the first of its kind .
According to the lead author of the study , graduate student Jin Goh , men who exhibit displays of chivalry are hindering gender equality with their “ benevolent sexism ” .
So apparently when it comes to gender equality , the nice guy is just a wolf in sheep 's clothing .
The study involved 27 pairs of undergraduate heterosexual couples who were filmed while playing a game of trivia and as they idly chatted afterwards .
The researchers then scrutinised the interactions of the men and women by noting everything including non-verbal cues such as smiles and body language .
Prior to the observation , Mr Goh measured the personal ideals of the men using a test called the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory . The test has men rate their agreement with statements like “ women are too easily offended ” ( an example of hostile sexism ) and “ a good woman should be set on a pedestal by their man ” ( an example of benevolent sexism ) . Agreeing with a statement that suggests equality , such as “ women should n't necessarily be rescued before men during a disaster ” , displays less of a tendency towards benevolent sexism .
No matter how the women acted , men were more likely to show patience and friendly non-verbal cues the more highly they rated on the benevolent sexism scale
So basically , irrespective of how the women acted , some men were rigidly tethered to their preconceived ideas about the fairer sex .
The men who registered a higher level of benevolent sexism also used more positive emotional words and were more patient while waiting for a woman to answer trivia questions . Researchers felt such behaviour serves to reinforce the paradigm of women as the more feeble sex .
“ It 's a very paternalistic , protective view of women , and it seems kind of appealing as a sort of chivalry , ” Mr Goh said . “ But it does contribute to inequality , because these men do n't expect women to achieve high goals . ”
So apparently , these poor sods are just misguided , well meaning fools . Mind you , the study makes no mention of accounting for the fact people might just be acting nice because they know they 're being monitored .
Whether you think the study is a win for highlighting the insidiousness of the patriarchal power structures that shape our world view or simply demonises attempts at genteel behaviour , the debate over chivalry as sexism is nothing new .
Over the weekend , Emma Watson who is an outspoken advocate for gender equality , weighed in on the issue during a Facebook Q & A .
“ The key is chivalry should be consensual , both parties should be feeling good about that . I think it 's a problem when people expect things to be a certain way , to follow a certain status quo , ” they said .
Amen , Ms Watson .
So guys , if you want to be a gentleman , ask your girlfriend to mow the lawn every now and then .
Have you ever felt like you behave differently depending on your cultural surroundings ? As an immigrant , I know I start mimicking others ' accents and body language once I 'm out of my heritage culture . This type of environment-induced chameleon-like morphing is called – quite aptly – “ frame switching ” in psychology . Scientists do n't really know if it happens automatically or controlled , but the effects are quite powerful – frame switching does n't stop at your outwards behaviors , it also impacts how you think about a problem and subsequent judgments and decisions .
In many cases frame switching is helpful – you assimilate faster to a new environment , tailoring your thinking to that of the other people around you . For example , in the Prisoner 's Dilemma task , where a person chooses to either cooperate or defect , Chinese Americans switched strategies adaptively : when “ primed ” with Chinese symbols like dragons or yin-yang , they preferred to cooperate ( in line with Chinese ideals of harmony ) ; when shown pictures of superman and the Statue of Liberty , they tended to act like western economists and defect more . Culture cues are like magnets that attract and activate a network of “ thinking ” that we associate with a culture – this is great , since we better fit in .
…Right ?
If Chinese icons can lead to a “ Chinese ” way of thinking , could it also induce a tendency to speak Chinese ? For Chinese immigrants living in Chinatown , could this then impair their ability to learn English ?
Shu Zhang et al ( 2013 ) . Heritage-culture images disrupt immigrants ' second-language processing through triggering first-language interference . PNAS early edition . doi:10.1073/pnas.1304435110 .
To test this hypothesis , researchers recruited Chinese students who 've been attending university in the US for roughly a year and sat them down in front of a computer showing either a Caucasian or Chinese male called “ Michael Lee ” . Michael “ spoke ” to the volunteers through an audio recording in a standard American English accent . The volunteers were then asked to converse with Michael about campus life while their speech was recorded . To assess English fluency , the researchers had two separate listeners rate the recordings and they also objectively counted words produced per minute after weeding out the “ uhs ” and “ ahhs ” . Ironically , as seen below , even though volunteers preferred to chat to the Chinese version of Michael , their English fluency significantly dropped by more than 10 % on average , as did their speech rate .
But maybe the volunteers felt obligated to talk to a Caucasian face in English who would otherwise not understand them . To rule out motivation as a cause of the performance gap , researchers showed volunteers five icons of Chinese ( Great Wall ) or American ( Mount Rushmore ) culture and asked them to describe the icons in English . Volunteers then had to make up a story about a culture-neutral image , also in English . Once again , English fluency and speech rate both tanked by 10-20 % when describing culture-laden images ( left column ) . Even worse , the volunteers also had a more difficult time telling an English story about the culture-neutral item when primed with pictures of the Great Wall ( second left column ) .
Why is this happening ? One possibility is that Chinese cues prime the immigrants to think in the Chinese lexicon . Instead of thinking of a pistachio as “ pistachio ” , for example , they might tend to name it as a “ happy nut ” , which is the literal translation of the nut 's Chinese name . To test this hypothesis , volunteers were again primed with culture-laden images . They were then asked to identify the literal-translation names ( “ happy nut ” , “ cotton stick ” , “ flying dish ” ) of a series of objects . Just like the researchers thought , when primed with Chinese rather than American icons , volunteers took much less time to identify those names . Showing culture-neutral images at the beginning did not affect literal-name identification at all . Finally , volunteers also tended to call objects by their literal translation name when primed with Chinese icons . Priming with American icons , on the other hand , did not help them increase their English proficiency .
This study shows just how exquisitely we are attuned to culture context , in that even seeing a symbol of a heritage culture can pull us back into our old linguistic structure and interfere with new language learning . As someone who grew up in multiple countries speaking multiple languages , I can totally relate to the feeling of frame switching and language/cultural priming . I do wish the authors included analysis of how many “ extraneous ” words the volunteers used , including the stutters , repetitions and self-corrections rather than ruling them out . I 'd also like to do this test on Chinese-Americans who learned Chinese and English simultaneously in an American culture – would Chinese icons decrease English and/or increase Chinese proficiency ?
Finally , this study suggests that the best way to learn a second language is immersion learning . If you want to assimilate , do n't move into an ethnic pocket where you 'll be surrounded by people from your homeland . You might feel more comfortable talking to them – but it wo n't help your new language learning .
For all the multilinguals and multicultural people out there , have you ever noticed this cultural priming effect ? Has it influenced your ability to speak a language ?

STAR WARS is n't the only high-profile , Geektastically interesting project Oscar Isaac has going at the moment .
Besides appearing as Rebel pilot Poe Dameron in THE FORCE AWAKENS , he 'll also appear as En Sabah Nur / ‘ Apocalypse ' in 2016 's X-MEN : APOCALYPSE .
A few days ago , Isaac suggested that - not surprisingly - Apocalypse 's comic book penchant for controlling the molecules in their body will be a talent retained in the film .
( The costume ) has n't been figured out yet , but one of their major powers is being able to change all the molecules in their body , ”
[ EDIT ]
“ So I 'll be changing all the molecules in my body… It 's gon na be a lot of fun . ”
Now , via Yahoo UK , Isaac talks more about how this character will be realized for the next bigscreen X-adventure :
“ It 'll be a mix [ of practical and digital ] . I have n't had a script so I have n't had a chance to look through the script and see what the exact requirements are , but I think it 'll be a mixture of physical , aided with some robotic technology . ”
[ EDIT ]
“ After we finish here I 'm heading to do a head cast [ for ‘ X-Men : Apocalypse ' ] , which they do often . You spend 3-4 hours with them putting plaster all over your head and they get a sense of what your face is like and what shape your head is , so they can start figuring out the costume and the makeup and all that stuff , which is pretty fun
X-MEN : APOCALYPSE is now in pre-production . We recently learned that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen wo n't be involved with this one , which is a bummer - but it 'll be interesting to see what this picture has in store for us all the same .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Smoke belching from Asia 's rapidly growing economies is largely responsible for a halt in global warming in the decade after 1998 because of sulphur 's cooling effect , even though greenhouse gas emissions soared , a U.S. study said on Monday .

The paper raised the prospect of more rapid , pent-up climate change when emerging economies eventually crack down on pollution .
World temperatures did not rise from 1998 to 2008 , while manmade emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuel grew by nearly a third , various data show .
The researchers from Boston and Harvard Universities and Finland 's University of Turku said pollution , and specifically sulphur emissions , from coal-fueled growth in Asia was responsible for the cooling effect .
Sulphur allows water drops or aerosols to form , creating hazy clouds which reflect sunlight back into space .
“ Anthropogenic activities that warm and cool the planet largely cancel after 1998 , which allows natural variables to play a more significant role , ” the paper said .
Natural cooling effects included a declining solar cycle after 2002 , meaning the sun 's output fell .
The study said that the halt in warming had fueled doubts about anthropogenic climate change , where scientists say manmade greenhouse gas emissions are heating the Earth .
“ It has been unclear why global surface temperatures did not rise between 1998 and 2008 , ” said the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States .
A peak in temperatures in 1998 coincided with a strong El Nino weather event , a natural shift which brings warm waters to the surface of the Pacific Ocean every few years .
Subsequent years have still included nine of the top 10 hottest years on record , while the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said 2010 was tied for the record .
A U.N. panel of climate scientists said in 2007 that it was 90 percent certain that humankind was causing global warming .
COAL
Sulphur aerosols may remain in the atmosphere for several years , meaning their cooling effect will gradually abate once smokestack industries clean up .
The study echoed a similar explanation for reduced warming between the 1940s and 1970s , blamed on sulphur emissions before Western economies cleaned up largely to combat acid rain .
“ The post 1970 period of warming , which constitutes a significant portion of the increase in global surface temperature since the mid 20th century , is driven by efforts to reduce air pollution , ” it said .
Sulphur emissions are linked to coal consumption which in China grew more than 100 percent in the decade to 2008 , or nearly three times the rate of the previous 10 years , according to data from the energy firm BP .
Other climate scientists broadly supported Monday 's study , stressing that over longer time periods rising greenhouse gas emissions would over-ride cooling factors .
“ Long term warming will continue unless emissions are reduced , ” said Peter Stott , head of climate monitoring at Britain 's Met Office .

The appointment of a special counsel empowered to probe ties between Russia and Donald Trump 's presidential campaign now brings the developer 's business empire into investigators ' cross hairs .
It 's an entirely new ballgame for the Trump Organization , which until the surprise appointment Wednesday had been somewhat removed from the political turmoil engulfing the president .
“ The gloves are off . I do n't think I 'd call it carte blanche , but it 's pretty close , ” said Roscoe C. Howard , appointed by President George W. Bush in 2001 to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia .
Did Trump , their family or campaign officials meet with Russian officials or people tied to Russia at Mar-a-Lago , the South Florida resort that the president has taken to calling their southern White House ? What about Trump Tower in New York , where son-in-law Jared Kushner secretly met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December ?
Those questions are fair game now .
The investigation by a special counsel must follow facts and a line of inquiry consistent with the defined mandate . But there is a lot of running room for an investigator who by design has been freed from having to worry about angering the occupant of the White House .
Legal threats to Trump 's business empire and presidency were largely diffuse before former FBI Director Robert Mueller was named by the Justice Department as special counsel .
Almost everything now falls into the broad authority given to Mueller under Order No . 3915-2017 . They were authorized to investigate “ any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated ” with the Trump campaign and “ any matter that arose or may arise directly from the investigation . ”
That means almost anything counts if it has come out of the look into potential collusion between Russia , Russians and the 2016 presidential elections .
“ It is a very broad order , ” said Donald C. Smaltz , one of the few who can say been there , done that .
Smaltz was appointed in 1994 to be an independent counsel , similar to what today is a special counsel , and they led an investigation into then-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy .
“ I feel more confident with a special counsel here that you are going to have a more focused investigation than you might have otherwise , ” they said .
Any look at Trump 's business dealings with Russians would likely include their trophy properties in South Florida , which include the Trump National Doral golf club .
Mueller 's investigators may ask whether either Mar-a-Lago , the historic getaway for the wealthy in Palm Beach , or Trump National , an 800-acre resort roughly 12 miles west of downtown Miami , was used to host meetings between Trump associates and Russian operatives .
McClatchy reported last month that foreign leaders have used Mar-a-Lago to conduct under-the-radar meetings with Trump since their election . In April , two former Colombian presidents secretly met Trump there to discuss the peace process in their home country . The meeting was not on the president 's schedule or disclosed to reporters .
Wealthy Russians could have sought access to Trump by seeking membership at Mar-a-Lago . The exclusive club doubled its membership fee to $ 200,000 after Trump 's election .
A look into Russian dealings could include Trump 's sale of their Palm Beach mansion to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev in July 2008 for $ 95 million . That price was viewed by real estate experts as wildly inflated , leading to speculation that perhaps it was a backdoor investment in other Trump businesses , something the president has vehemently denied .
Before the financial crisis , Trump also licensed their name to six condo towers north of Miami Beach that attracted substantial Russian investment . The area of Sunny Isles has come to be known sarcastically as Moscow on the Beach because of so many Russian buyers .
A Reuters review of property records in March found Russians had invested nearly $ 100 million in Trump-branded Florida properties .
“ Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets , ” Donald Trump Jr. famously said at a real estate conference in 2008 , according to multiple news outlets .
None of that means collusion to influence an election . But any look by Mueller into Russians who might have had the ear of Trump or their associates could certainly touch on their real estate holdings .
Late Friday , The Washington Post reported that a current White House official is a “ significant person of interest ” for reasons of possible collusion and financial crimes . That suggested the investigation is reaching the upper echelons of the Trump administration .
Mueller wo n't have any additional powers that are lacked by the FBI or the Justice Department , which gave them their mission .
“ These special counsels have the same authority . . . . It is no more or less , ” said Joseph diGenova , who was appointed an independent counsel in 1992 , a post similar to what Mueller today occupies . “ What matters is how it is wielded . In the case of Mueller it will be wielded wisely . ”
Arguably the biggest difference is that the very existence of a special counsel moves the investigation to a more serious level . Where a witness might have had room to maneuver if Congress called them to appear , they have less so if Mueller and their team want to talk .
“ Dealing with congressional investigations , lawyers have many more opportunities to prevent things from happening , because these committees have very little enforcement power , ” said diGenova . “ You can claim privileges ( to the special counsel ) but you ca n't resist in the way that you can in a congressional investigation . ”
The special counsel also dampens the impact of the political theater that invariably accompanies congressional probes .
“ There is a lot of smoke out there , and a lot of it is political vapors , ” cautioned Smaltz .
It 's been widely reported that the FBI had some Trump campaign members under surveillance last summer , getting the OK from a secret court .
But another form of taping might now be in Mueller 's view too . Days after firing FBI Director James Comey , Trump tweeted out a veiled threat May 12 that Comey “ better hope that there are no ‘ tapes ' ” of their private conservations . It seemed to warn that Trump had recorded evidence .
James Comey better hope that there are no `` tapes '' of our conversations before they start leaking to the press ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 12 , 2017
The tweet and fallout from it most surely will prompt a request from the special counsel to Trump for tapes .
“ He 's the guy who put it out there , and my guess is they 'll do it through a subpoena from a grand jury , ” said Howard , who served as U.S. attorney from 2001 to 2004 .
If Trump routinely recorded private conversations , Mueller could also demand the recordings of son-in-law Kushner , who held private talks in December at Trump Tower with Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn , Trump 's national security adviser who was fired Feb. 14 for being untruthful about meetings with Kislyak .
Another person potentially in the line of inquiry is Trump 's longtime personal attorney Michael D. Cohen , who in February forwarded to Flynn for Trump a would-be peace plan for Russia and its neighbor Ukraine .
The plan did n't come from diplomats but rather Russian émigré and ex-con Felix Sater , who had worked for the Trump Organization as a senior adviser , and pro-Moscow Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko .
As farfetched as it seemed , Cohen confirmed to The New York Times that they had taken their proposal to Flynn about a week before Flynn 's firing .
Cohen was involved in Trump projects in the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Georgia , and during the campaign they were one of Trump 's staunchest defenders on television .
The advantage of now having a special counsel is it mutes any criticism that the outcome of the probe is a politically motivated conclusion .
“ The key thing for a law enforcement investigation is not only to do it the right way , but to be perceived it 's done the right way , ” said Matt Axelrod , a former senior Justice Department lawyer . “ That 's the advantage of appointing Bob Mueller because of their well-deserved reputation for integrity and credibility . ”
Added Dan Richman , a former federal prosecutor who 's now a law professor at Columbia University in New York : “ He will ensure that all strands of this sprawling investigation go forward with the resources needed . ”

A feared criminal gang is trying to muscle in on Dublin 's rickshaw business which is worth hundreds of thousands of euros a year .
Associates in the Crumlin-Drimnagh gang have been
trying to force out legitimate entrepreneurs and cash in on the lucrative enterprise .
Two gang members told one owner to stop supplying bikes to their employees and they 'd be taking over . But the brave boss told them they would n't be moving and he 'd be continuing their custom .
There are several businesses which own the bikes in Dublin and lease them out to cyclists for €150-a-week .
One firm has 100 of the bikes and rakes in €15,000-a-week .
The minimum take a year for some of these firms is around €750,000 . Gardai are aware of the intimidation against business owner and are understood to be monitoring the situation closely .
A security source said : “ This sort of behaviour has only started to develop in Dublin about two or three weeks ago .
“ It was only when these guys found out how much money
there was to be made from this sort of business that they went for it .
“ It 's a minimum of 15 grand a week in some cases so that 's
easy money they thought they could get .
“ But they were expecting one of the lads running it to just move away but they told them where to go . The guards will have to monitor what happens because these boys do n't joke around . ”
Rickshaw drivers sprung up several Irish cities in the past 10 years .
They are modelled on the popular tourist bicycles in Thailand and charge small fees to get around city streets quickly .
Many can be seen outside nightclubs ferrying revellers to other bars or to taxi ranks .
Colorado moving on to other candidates for its head football coach

A miserable season on the football field ended nearly two weeks ago for the Colorado Buffaloes , but the program lost again today when Cincinnati coach Butch Jones turned down the school 's offer to take over as head coach .
Jones received a counter offer from their current employer and may decide to remain as head coach of the Bearcats for a fourth season in 2013 . They were also being listed as a candidate for Tennessee 's opening as of Thursday evening .
Where does CU go from here ?
Colorado officials are likely to contact San Jose State coach Mike MacIntyre or Fresno State coach Tim DeRuyter , though DeRuyter has been a head coach for only one year and might not have the experience CU desires in its next head coach .
Athletic director Mike Bohn and their bosses have a list of targets that also could include former Cal coach Jeff Tedford , but its unclear if Tedford would have interest in the job . Earlier in Colorado 's search process , a source who had spoken to Tedford said the coach viewed Colorado as a difficult place to win . Tedford was fired at Cal three weeks ago after the Bears finished the season 3-9 .
CU could also look to the NFL for a coach .
It is unclear if the media circus that has followed Colorado 's courtship of Jones ultimately scared them away , but it probably did n't help .
The final act of that circus happened Wednesday when a Denver Post report based on an unnamed source said CU had hired Jones . The school and Jones quickly refuted the report
Jones has now talked with Colorado , Purdue and Kentucky this year about coaching vacancies . They also talked with numerous schools about coaching jobs last offseason and has decided to remain at Cincinnati through it all .
The five-year contract CU offered Jones was worth approximately $ 2.7 million annually and would have made Jones the highest paid coach in Colorado history .
It 's unlikely the Buffs would be willing to offer the same deal to other confirmed candidates for the job such as DeRuyter and MacIntyre .
The school is in the market for a football coach for the third time in the past seven years after athletic director Mike Bohn fired former coach Jon Embree nine days ago . The Buffs completed a 1-11 season being blown out by margins of 20 points or more in a majority of their games , which led to the coaching change .
This season was the worst in the modern history of the program , not just because of the team 's record but also because the offense and defense both finished at or near the bottom of major national statistical rankings . The Buffs were not competitive in most games .
Sources said Jones became the leading candidate for the Colorado job after Bohn reached out to multiple fellow athletic directors , several head-hunter consultants and sources in the NFL seeking suggestions . Jones ' name was consistently proposed by most of the people Bohn spoke to .
Jones visited Boulder on Monday with their wife , Barb , and interviewed for the job with a group of CU administrators and at least one booster on the suite level at Folsom Field . They also talked briefly with four CU players and toured parts of the campus and the Dal Ward Center .
At one point , food service workers helped hide Jones behind a food warmer to allow them to move from the club level at Folsom to the Dal Ward Center without being photographed .
When Jones extended their stay by several hours Monday night , it was seen a positive sign , but when they returned to Cincinnati they received the counter offer .
Cincinnati 's status as a member of the Big East Conference was assumed to be a concern for Jones because that league is losing members from its traditional geographical footprint and replacing them with schools from San Diego State to Central Florida .
Cincinnati 's need to upgrade Nippert Stadium was also believed to be an issue Jones wanted addressed . It 's unclear if school officials there have given them assurances about either of those issues or if Jones simply decided they are comfortable in their current job .

`` The O.C . '' fans may recall that Baccarin had a brief stint on the show that made McKenzie famous , playing Maya Griffin for three episodes in 2006 .
We wish the expectant parents all the best .

The U.S. is typically viewed as a melting pot of races and cultures , but recent maps showing the ethnic distribution of the U.S. seem to hint that the U.S. is n't as well-mixed as we all thought . In this visualization , I mapped out the racial/ethnic diversity of the U.S. to give us a better sense of the hotspots of diversity .
To calculate racial/ethnic diversity , I computed the entropy on the “ % ethnicity ” data for each county using the 6 ethnic categories the U.S. Census tracks : White ( non-Latino ) , African American , Native American , Asian American , Latino , and Other . A county will come out with high entropy when all 6 ethnic categories are as even as possible ( i.e. , each ~16.7 % ) , whereas it will come out with low entropy if the county is only inhabited by people of one ethnic category . I 've included the raw census data if you want to tinker with it yourself .
One of the most notable features is that the Midwest and Northeast are fairly homogeneously white . Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine stand as the pinnacle of racial homogeneity , each with only one or two counties with even a blip of diversity . The only exceptions to this trend are the major cities throughout the U.S. , which seem to attract people of all ethnicities regardless of the state the city is in .
As a Michigander , I 'm the most surprised to see how diverse the Upper Peninsula is . I thought only crazy white people lived up that far in Michigan .
Here 's the least diverse counties :
Tucker County , West Virginia ( 100 % White , non-Latino ) Robertson County , Kentucky ( 100 % White , non-Latino ) Hooker County , Nebraska ( 100 % White , non-Latino ) Hand County , South Dakota ( 99 % White , non-Latino and 1 % Latino ) Owsley County , Kentucky ( 98 % White , non-Latino and 2 % Latino )
And the most diverse counties :
Aleutians West Census Area , Alaska ( 31.4 % White ( non Latino ) , 5.7 % African American , 15.1 % Native American , 28.3 % Asian American , 13.1 % Latino , and 6.4 % Other ) Aleutians East Borough , Alaska ( 13.5 % White ( non Latino ) , 6.7 % African American , 27.7 % Native American , 35.4 % Asian American , 12.3 % Latino , and 4.4 % Other ) Queens County , New York ( 27.6 % White ( non Latino ) , 17.7 % African American , 0.3 % Native American , 22.8 % Asian American , 27.5 % Latino , and 4 % Other ) Alameda County , California ( 34.1 % White ( non Latino ) , 12.2 % African American , 0.3 % Native American , 25.9 % Asian American , 22.5 % Latino , and 5.1 % Other ) Solano County , California ( 40.8 % White ( non Latino ) , 14.2 % African American , 0.5 % Native American , 14.3 % Asian American , 24 % Latino , and 6.2 % Other )

A small plane crashed in the Mississippi River near Ramsey on Friday evening , and a woman pulled from the water died , the Anoka County Sheriff 's Office said .
Lt. Brent Erickson said authorities do not yet know how many people were aboard the plane , which appeared to be a single-engine Cessna , when it struck power lines near the 6400 block of Riverdale Drive NW . around 5:35 p.m .
Witnesses who called 911 reported the plane was flying low — at or below the treetops — and heading upriver when it hit power lines stretched across the river and “ did a nose-dive into the river , ” they said . According to witness statements , the plane did not appear to have engine trouble .
“ Why the pilot did n't see the power lines or why they were flying low … we are unsure , ” Erickson said .
Several witnesses got into their pontoons and rendered aid , pulling the woman from the water . They were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics , Erickson said .
Emergency personnel have gathered some debris and have an idea of where the plane is in the river . They are planning to have divers search the river Saturday , but high water levels and the rapid current could hamper recovery efforts , Erickson said .

Officials have not determined the plane 's departure point or destination .
Investigators are reviewing video of the crash to confirm the number on the tail of the plane , Erickson said . The plane was believed to be a four-seater .
The woman 's identity was unknown Friday evening .
Lora Hamilton , 83 , of Ramsey , said they were having supper at their home near the river when they saw the low-flying plane .
“ It was below tree height , ” they said . Then they heard the crash .
Multiple power lines were down after the crash , said Adam Jachymowski of Ramsey-based Connexus Energy .
About 540 consumers in Ramsey and north Dayton were briefly without power , they said .
Power was restored shortly before 7 p.m .
A Bangladeshi migrant accused of raping a drunk 17-year-old after they picked them up in their taxi is a “ sexual predator ” , a court has heard .
Katar Shahin was sentenced at Swansea Crown Court to 10 years in prison for raping the drunk teenager , whom the taxi driver “ targeted ” for assault after noticing them heavily under the influence of alcohol , according to the judge .
Jurors heard that , in the early hours of June 4 , they spotted the girl walking in Swansea 's city centre — where they had consumed alcohol , cannabis , and a sleeping tablet on a night out with friends — and pulled up beside them in their taxi , asking if they needed a ride .
When the teenager , who stated during the trial that they only got into the vehicle because they believed taxis are all fitted with CCTV for passengers ' safety , told Shahin they had no money , they said they would give them a lift for free .
Instead , the 40-year-old drove first to McDonald 's , where they bought the girl a drink , and food for himself , and then to their house , where they told the teenager they needed to make a quick stop before driving them home .
Private Hire Driver Found Guilty of ‘ Appalling ' Rape of Glasgow Teen
https : //t.co/FWfTTDOCdi — Breitbart London ( @ BreitbartLondon ) November 9 , 2017
Shahid insisted they could not leave the girl alone in their taxi , so they agreed to go into the house with him , where they then proceeded to try and ply them with alcohol , the court heard .
When they refused , the Bangladeshi tried to kiss and fondle the 17-year-old , who resisted their advances but passed out after feeling drowsy as a result of their intoxication .
The next thing the girl remembered , they said at trial , was waking up naked and seeing a used condom on the floor , before Shahin dropped them off outside a pub in Swansea .
They contacted police the following day , telling them they feared the taxi driver could have raped her , but that they were not sure .
After a police search of Shahin 's house turned up a used condom , the married migrant claimed they had masturbated into it after driving the girl home .
However , with tests revealing the victim 's DNA on the condom , Shahin then changed their story , alleging that the teenager was a prostitute whom they paid £20 for sex .
After the first rape , the child flagged down a passing car , the driver of which proceeded to rape their https : //t.co/odAv56T5jm — Breitbart London ( @ BreitbartLondon ) July 28 , 2017
Judge Geraint Walters described this claim as a “ scandalous assertion which the jury found to be a complete lie ” .
They told the court : “ It seems to me you probably picked-up this girl because you observed they appeared to be heavily under the influence of alcohol – to an extent they were targeted .
“ By the time you drove to McDonald 's that night you had decided to see if you could have sex with them By the time you raped her , you knew they were under the influence of alcohol and drugs . ”
Defending Shahin , barrister Robin Rouch said there had been no concerns over their client 's behaviour prior to the rape , adding that the immigrant had been in employment since arriving in Britain from Bangladesh , where they regularly send money to support their wife and family .

The Los Angeles Rams 2017 Training Camp officially begins today . For all the info you need getting to camp , getting around and what to pay attention to , check out our training camp preview . Here 's the training camp schedule with all 15 practices .
Here are the main four storylines we 'll be tracking for every practice throughout camp :
Injuries
The Rams enter camp with 10 players listed unavailable :
Physically Unable To Perform ( PUP ) List - Active
Non-Football Injury ( NFI ) List - Active
On top of those two , we know WR Tavon Austin is coming back from wrist surgery in early May while LB Josh Forrest tore their ACL in November .

Alexander , Joyner and Harkey are all available :
Rams ' Mo Alexander , Lamarcus Joyner and Cory Harkey got removed from non-football injury list , so they are eligible to practice today . — Rich Hammond ( @ Rich_Hammond ) July 29 , 2017
McVay 's O
This is sure to be the big draw today . Seeing how QB Jared Goff is handled between new Rams Head Coach Sean McVay and new Offensive Coordinator Matt LaFleur with new rookies TE Gerald Everett and WR Cooper Kupp to go with the second-year targets is likely going to be where most fans focus .
Wading with Wade
If the Rams have any chance at avoiding a losing record this year though , it 's going to require the defense to carry the day . New Defensive Coordinator Wade Phillips is tasked with doing what former Head Coach Jeff Fisher and former Defensive Coordinator Gregg Williams could not : translate the talent on defense into a top NFL defense .
# FightForLA
This is more of a long-term storyline with the Rams visiting the Chargers on August 5 as they come to our place four days later , but perhaps we hear the grumblings of the attendees about the mere existence of the Chargers in the vicinity just minutes away .

A team from the Basque Institute for Agricultural Research and Development ( Neiker-Tecnalia ) has questioned the generally held belief that the quality of tomatoes depends primarily on their exposure to natural light and states that the most determining factor is temperature . The research was drawn up by the Institute 's Department of Agricultural Production and Protection and opens up great possibilities for starting new plantations in zones where light intensity is low due to weather conditions .
The findings are of particular interest in geographic zones such as the Cantabrian mountain range in the north of Spain , where there is frequent cloud cover and an average of 140 rainy days per year , and which could be suitable for growing greenhouse tomatoes , despite low levels of solar radiation .
The study evaluated the different indicators for organoleptic ( taste and texture ) quality and nutritional quality , such as acidity , soluble solids , phenolic compounds , pH and vitamin C content . To this end , the tomato plants were exposed to photosynthetic radiation between 30 and 50 % less than the usual for the sunny zones in the south of the Iberian Peninsula , at the same time as studying other tomato plants undergoing 100 % exposure . Cultivation was carried out on soil , in a greenhouse without artificial heating and shaded in a small area so that air currents were able to homogenise the temperature within the plantation .
The results showed that the organoleptic and nutritional quality was very similar between the plants exposed to greater solar radiation and those with less . Another conclusion of the research opens up the possibility of reducing costs of heating , something that researchers in other European countries such as the Netherlands are working on -- through the selection of seed varieties that need less energy . According to Mr Patrick Riga , the author of the report , `` heating bills can be reduced while obtaining the same quality of tomato '' ; although , as a disadvantage , yield is less . In Mr Riga 's opinion , `` growers have to choose between production or quality . ''
Researchers are now focusing on analysing how much the temperature can be reduced in order to cut down on energy consumption without affecting quality parameters . These findings can also be applied to other kinds of fruit with high nutritional value , such as strawberries , cucumbers , melons and watermelons .
Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan put up $ 100,000 for Mayor Brown 's re-election bid last month , bringing Khan 's total support for Brown to $ 200,000 in the high-spending battle for mayor , according to the latest campaign finance reports .
Total campaign contributions from all donors have topped $ 5 million for Brown and challenger Lenny Curry combined . The amount for Brown 's re-election is $ 2.53 million through the end of March , and the amount for Curry is $ 2.5 million through March 27 , putting them in a virtual dead heat in fundraising .
Khan is the top-dollar contributor in the hard-fought contest between Brown , the Democratic incumbent , and Curry , the Republican .
`` As someone who is committed to Jacksonville , as a citizen , businessperson and owner of the Jaguars , I am going to be active in the political process here , '' Khan said in a statement . `` I believe in Mayor Brown and am proud to support him .
`` This is a critical time in the history of Jacksonville and it 's important to maintain the momentum we 've experienced in job growth and the resulting economic upturn , all under the leadership of Mayor Brown . ''
Curry 's quest also has drawn hefty contributions from backers , such as Peter Rummell , a real estate developer active in civic affairs . Rummell and their wife have contributed $ 171,000 to help Curry .
Rummell backed Brown in 2011 but later said Brown had proven to be a weak leader on the big challenges facing the city .
`` He does not know how to manage . That 's clear , '' Rummell told the Times-Union in an April 2014 interview . `` He has no courage . … He 's wimped out . He 's deferred to City Council . It 's embarrassing the way he 's handled himself . ''
Rummell emerged as an early backer of Curry , saying they would be a strong leader .
The candidates spent almost all the money raised in the run-up to the March 24 `` first election , '' so they 'll need another fundraising push in the weeks leading up to the May 19 election .
In March , Khan contributed $ 50,000 to Taking Jacksonville to the Next Level , a political committee supporting Brown 's re-election bid . In addition , Regent Consultant , a corporation whose manager is Khan , contributed $ 50,000 to the political committee .
Khan previously gave $ 100,000 to Taking Jacksonville to the Next Level .
After Khan bought the Jaguars in 2012 , Brown and the City Council supported the construction of gigantic scoreboards and swimming pools at city-owned EverBank Field . The city 's $ 43 million share of the cost will be paid for from bed taxes charged on hotel room stays . Khan put up $ 20 million for the renovations .
Khan also is interested in becoming the master developer of The Shipyards , which covers 46 acres of vacant , city-owned land on the downtown riverfront . The deadline for developers to submit their proposals for The Shipyards is 2 p.m. Wednesday .
In Khan 's statement Tuesday , they said they are `` particularly impressed by Mayor Brown 's vision to revitalize downtown Jacksonville , which is home to the Jaguars and central to the identity of our community . I also have ambition for downtown Jacksonville , as evidenced by our recent proposal to develop The Shipyards . I am optimistic we will see this project through with Mayor Brown in office . ''
Curry also has spoken favorably about Khan 's proposal for The Shipyards , saying the vision `` is bold and it 's big . We 're blessed to have Shad Khan here . ''
So far , Taking Jacksonville to the Next Level has raked in almost $ 1.9 million and spent about $ 1.88 million through the end of March in support of Brown , reports filed with the Florida Division of Elections show .
Curry also has backing from a high-octane political committee called Together for a Greater Jacksonville . Through March 27 , it had collected $ 1.79 million and spent $ 1.76 million .
State law does not limit how many contributors can give to political committees , so that 's where the heavy hitters are putting their contributions .
The candidates also have their own campaign accounts , which limit contributions to $ 1,000 per election cycle .
Brown 's campaign has raised almost $ 633,000 and spent $ 578,000 through March 27 , according to filings with the Duval County Supervisor of Elections office .
Curry 's campaign has raised $ 708,000 and spent almost $ 689,000 .
The bottom line for the candidates is that even after raising millions of dollars , they spent almost all of it leading up to the March 24 election when Brown captured 43 percent of the vote , followed by Curry with 38 percent . Third-place finisher Bill Bishop won 17 percent , forcing a final contest on May 19 between Brown and Curry .

Married Christians love telling single people why they ca n't have sex .
I ca n't say why . But I can say that we singles are left navigating sexual desires that are good and holy , which are nevertheless expressed and experienced by twisted and sinful hearts and minds , souls and bodies .
Singles have been given a one–verse allowance for thinking about their sexuality : “ . . . it is better to marry than to burn with passion ” ( 1 Corinthians 7:9 ) .
I wish that all were as I myself am . But each has their own gift from God , one of one kind and one of another . To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am . But if they can not exercise self-control , they should marry . For it is better to marry than to burn with passion . ( 1 Corinthians 7:7–9 )
An ancient command , and the scenarios which we face as singles today are arguably more difficult : “ Asking unmarried singles to control their sexual impulses for longer and longer periods of time is a fairly new phenomenon in our culture . This has been brought about by an earlier-age onset of puberty combined with later-age marriages ” ( Balswick & Balswick , Authentic Human Sexuality , 107 ) .
Some dating couples abuse 1 Corinthians 7:9 and wield it ( and their wedding plans ) to rush foolishly in lust instead of taking wise steps out of love for God and neighbor . Struggling , unhealthy couples will steal “ better to marry ” as an excuse to make their destructive relationships permanent , and “ than to burn ” to legitimize sinful actions as good and natural . We need a serious look at 1 Corinthians 7:8–9 , to bulldoze through our cynicism and snide glances , and to open up our sinful impulses to critique and explanation , because God has spoken here about something that has gone nuclear in the past 20 years among Christian millennials . All while we 've been laughing about or marginalizing the passage that 's intended to inform and encourage us .
Below , we 're going to get into Paul 's very complex thoughts about the sexual desire of the unmarried Christian . But I want you to keep one thing in mind as you read ( the main point ) : The sexual desire of the unmarried person is good , is holy , and is part of the shining creation of the image of God . Among all of the other voices , some helpful and needed ( and some not ) , I want you , when you feel shame for sexuality or sexual desire , to be able to return to 1 Corinthians 7:9 and find peace . I want 1 Corinthians 7 to , without a doubt , be a place of respite for the unmarried Christian from shame , from self-hate , and from accusation , insofar as they feel those things about God 's good creation of their sexuality . You are loved , and you have sexual desires which propel you to get married which God endorses . Remember that as we interpret the text below .
What Does It Mean to “ Burn ” ?
It 's better to marry than to burn , but is it bad to burn ? Twitter Tweet Facebook Share on Facebook
A central issue in interpreting these verses is what Paul intends by the term “ burn with passion ” ( a single word : puroústhai , “ to burn ” ) and how burning relates to the theology of marriage that surrounds 1 Corinthians 7:8–9 ( 1 Corinthians 7:1–7 , 10–16 ) . Is marriage the coveted arena where each and every sexual fantasy comes to life ? Is marriage a crude medium to satiate our base and carnal desire for something that disgusts God ( i.e. , sex ) ? Is burning an inconvenient reality that both God and man must shamefully and reluctantly endure until heaven ?
I believe burning , for Paul , is a legitimate sexual desire among the unmarried . They state their audience clearly : “ the unmarried and the widows. ” The danger of this interpretation is that some will inevitably misconstrue sinful sexual desires as regular and good , and assume that marriage is meant to be an unrestricted place for our unhindered sexual whims .
But Paul answers this objection in the text , when they make the point that the Christian sexual ethic requires love of neighbor applied to the context of marriage — to love the spouse above oneself , against abusive relationship structures ( 1 Corinthians 7:2–4 ; cf . also Ephesians 5:3 , 25–33 ) . Mutual consent , healing , and concern for the other are necessary aspects of a Christ-honoring sexual relationship within marriage . It seems backward , then , that Paul would advocate entering into such a relationship for selfish reasons . “ Burning , ” then , seems to be best understood as legitimate and holy sexual desire among the unmarried .
The Goodness of Burning
Having taken this meaning for “ burning ” ( as legitimate sexual desire among singles ) , we have three anchors which give us helpful points of application for Paul 's attitude toward premarital sexuality in 1 Corinthians 7:8–9 . Each is a stepping stone to understanding Paul 's overall attitude toward a Christian 's premarital sexuality .
1 . “ It is good for them to remain single as I am. ” ( 1 Corinthians 7:8 )
Paul is not saying that Christians should not pursue a spouse . This may be a counterintuitive reading , but we must listen to the text . We have an analogy to this way of speaking in Paul later in 1 Corinthians , when they say , “ I want you all to speak in tongues ” ( 1 Corinthians 14:5 ) . Paul 's point in 1 Corinthians 14:5 is clear . They are not saying that the whole church should speak in tongues — that 's the problem he 's addressing ( 1 Corinthians 12:30–31 ) . Paul is saying that , for the sake of love ( 1 Corinthians 13 ) , God only gave the gift of tongues to a few , so that the gift could be exercised as a gift to those who do n't speak in tongues . And , while tongues is a grace given to a few “ for the common good ” ( 1 Corinthians 12:7 ) , it is not meant to be had by all — in order that each church member should depend on the others ( 1 Corinthians 12:8–11 ) . Whether you believe the church should speak in tongues today or not , Paul 's teaching is clear : not everyone should speak in tongues , in order that love might prevail in the body .
Paul 's language in 1 Corinthians 7:8 functions the same way . Their point is that unique gifts ( singleness and tongues ) are great graces for him , but not for everyone ( the full sense of Paul 's “ wish ” language should be rendered “ I wish all were as I am — but they 're not , so they should n't try to be ” ) . In fact , it was in making particular gifts ( singleness and tongues ) signs of a higher and more mystical spirituality that the Corinthians were oppressing one another . The unmarried became the godly ascetic . The tongue-speaker became the divine mystic . Paul writes against both mindsets .
The gift of singleness is not given to all — and , for some , to attempt to live a life of singleness like Paul , without being called or gifted , is to spurn God and try to accomplish a ministry for which God has not given you resources ( hence , “ burning ” ) . If you can not exercise control , that does n't mean you should stay single until you do n't desire sex . It means , if the other right things are in place , a spouse may be a great help to you .
2 . “ If they can not exercise self-control , they should marry. ” ( 1 Corinthians 7:9 )
As we mentioned earlier , Paul is not saying that marriage is the playground for unfettered sexual fantasy to become reality . It means that whatever is good about our sexuality and sexual desires ( which is quite a bit ) is meant to be fulfilled in marriage . Our very bodies signify the obvious : “ The two will become one flesh ” ( 1 Corinthians 6:16 ; cf . Genesis 2:24 ) . Moreover , the sexual life to which Paul invites the unmarried in 1 Corinthians 7:8–9 is described only a few verses earlier in 1 Corinthians 7:2–5 . “ Conjugal rights ” ( 1 Corinthians 7:3 ) for Paul is more than a carnal and animal reality . For Paul , sexuality is a deeply spiritual and soteriological reality ( 1 Corinthians 6:16–20 ; Ephesians 5:31–32 ) .
How can anyone accuse Paul of reducing the value of marriage to the fulfillment of carnal desires when they just placed value on temporary abstinence within marriage ? He 's also just said in speaking of sexuality , “ Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you ” ( 1 Corinthians 6:19 ) . Paul is laboring here to present a balanced answer to a practical question asked by the married and unmarried about sex . We need patience to hear and embrace the fullness and nuance of Paul 's argument .
Of course , there is no such thing as sexuality that is not tainted by sin . Everyone entering marriage is entering it with their good desire twisted into lustful and selfish forms . And yes , it is only the Holy Spirit who can bring change and healing into that . But God has created ordinances and means of grace for their church to use for restoration and healing . It 's inordinately ambitious and theologically naïve to assume that healing and sanctification of one 's sexuality would not be helped by marriage . Again , we need to acknowledge , like Paul in 1 Corinthians 5 , that if a relationship is destructive , dysfunctional , or unhealthy , there are many times when the best path is separation and discipline , not marriage . Paul makes a basic , common-sense point : Marriage can help those struggling to remain pure with regard to their sexual desires .
3 . “ It is better to marry than to burn with passion. ” ( 1 Corinthians 7:9 )
For the married , sex is , according to the holy ordinance of marriage , a way to combat Satan themselves ( 1 Corinthians 7:5b ) . But abstinence is sometimes necessary in order to intentionally realign one 's sexual activity towards God ( 1 Corinthians 7:5a ) .
For the unmarried , sex is , according to the natural constitution of human sexuality , a way to combat “ burning ” ( 1 Corinthians 7:9 ) , but abstinence is necessary for the time in which the ordinance of marriage has not been instituted . Neither of these groups of people — the married or the unmarried — contain any members that remain unaddressed by Paul 's exhortations here . For all married , they should cultivate regular Christ-honoring sexual activity and proportionate abstinence for the sake of spiritual health . Likewise for the unmarried , except their cultivation of regular Christ-honoring sexual activity takes the form , not of copulation , but of following the exhortation “ they [ the unmarried and the widows ] should marry ” ( 1 Corinthians 7:9 ) . Our view of the goodness of the unmarried Christian 's sexual desire points us to Paul 's obvious point : “ It is better to marry . ”
Sojourning Sexual Beings
The single person 's desire for sex can be very good and God-glorifying . Twitter Tweet Facebook Share on Facebook
Take heart , unmarried brothers and sisters . Calvin knows . Speaking of the believer who burns , they say , “ Let them not despise the remedy which is offered to them . For those who are denied the power of continence [ self-control ] are called to marriage by God 's clear word ( 1 Corinthians 7:9 ) ” ( Calvin , Institutes ( IV.13.17 ) , 2:1272 ) .
Now , many of us would , of course , love to get married . . . if only we were asked .
If only they would say yes . If only , if only . . . if only . Yes , I understand . I 'm single , and I want to be married . We do n't have space here to get into that , but we do have one consolation from these passages : We 're not dirty and sinful because of our sexual desires , and God fights for us as creatures in their image with sexual desires , while Satan fights against us as creatures in God 's image with sexual desires ( 1 Corinthians 7:5 ) . In our sojourning as sexual creatures in the image of God , we have a high priest who helps us and endorses our journey along the way — even as we wrestle with sin ( Hebrews 2:17 ) , so that we might “ hold fast our confession ” ( Hebrews 4:14 ) , who guides us along the way in perfect power and wisdom ( Hebrews 8:1 ) . May God purify , sustain , and provide for the needs of their holy unmarried children .
Evgeniy Bogachev , one of the world 's most prolific — and wanted — cyber criminals . FBI WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- The FBI considers Evgeniy Bogachev one of the world 's most prolific and brilliant cyber criminals , slapping their photos - bald , beefy-faced and smiling faintly - on `` Wanted '' fliers posted online . The Russian would be an ideal target for prosecution - if only the Justice Department could find him .
Unable to capture them in the 10 months since their indictment , the government has turned to a time-honored technique long used for more conventional crime : putting a bounty on Bogachev 's head .
It 's too soon to say whether the $ 3 million reward for information leading to their arrest , offered under a special State Department program , will pay off . But federal officials say they intend to use the strategy in additional cyber cases involving international hackers whose whereabouts are either unknown to the U.S. government or who are holed up in nations that have little or no diplomatic relations with the United States .
`` We 've really not done something like this '' in cyber cases , Robert Anderson , an FBI executive assistant director , said in announcing the reward . `` All of a sudden , somebody 's putting an ` x ' on somebody , saying , ` Bring them to justice , you get $ 3 million . ' ''
The reward is also a reminder of how many accused masterminds of cyberattacks on U.S. targets remain out of reach for law enforcement .
Twitter/ @ DevlinBarrett Five Chinese military officials were indicted last spring on charges of siphoning away corporate secrets from computer systems of major American business . Federal officials say they 're committed to bringing them to justice , but they wo n't speak publicly about what they 're doing to nab them . Experts are skeptical that the military officials will ever see the inside of a courtroom .
Roman Zolotarev , charged in Nevada with masterminding a massive underworld marketplace of credit card fraud and identity theft , also is not in federal custody , even though lower-level members of the operation , called Carder.Su , have been convicted .

The culprits behind the Sony Pictures Entertainment hacking have not been publicly identified , though the FBI has linked it to the North Korean government .
Some defense lawyers for more peripheral players charged in cybercrimes have seized on the absence of accused ringleaders , highlighting a potential vulnerability in the government 's cases . The argument was raised in the 2013 trial of David Ray Camez , who was ultimately sentenced to 20 years in prison for their role in the Carder.su organization .
`` And they talk about all these people that created Carder.su , the real people , the bad guys in this case , where are they at ? '' Camez 's lawyer , Chris Rasmussen , told jurors . `` They do n't have any of these Russians here . There 's no Russians in this courtroom . Where are they ? ''

There 's generally limited recourse against hackers committing crimes from countries like Russia and China , where the U.S. lacks formal extradition treaties . Justice Department officials say they 're hopeful that as more countries are harmed by international cybercrime , there will be fewer sanctuaries for such criminals . And sometimes the best hope is for criminals to become careless over time and travel to countries where they 're exposed to arrest .
`` It can be a long , cold winter in Russia . A lot of these people have a lot of money . It 's pretty tempting to travel somewhere warmer , '' Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell , chief of the Justice Department 's criminal division , said in an interview .
There are isolated examples of that happening , though not as many as the U.S. would like .
Roman Seleznev , the son of a Russian lawmaker , was arrested last July after they traveled to the Maldives and is awaiting trial in Seattle on charges that they led a marketplace for stolen credit cards that raked in millions of dollars .

Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in Amsterdam in 2012 and extradited to New Jersey last month to face charges in a massive computer hacking scheme involving the theft of credit and debit card numbers from entities including JC Penney , 7-Eleven ands
Bogachev was indicted in Pittsburgh last year , accused of running two schemes that authorities say caused widespread financial losses . One , Cryptolocker , was a ransom-demanding virus that infected hundreds of thousands of computers . Another , Gameover Zeus , involved malicious software that intercepted customer bank account numbers and passwords that victims typed in . Both have been dismantled .
The FBI has n't revealed much about the 31-year-old Bogachev , but the agency says he 's believed to be in Russia and may travel by boat to locations along the Black Sea .
The $ 3 million reward is offered under a 2-year-old State Department program that so far has paid out more than $ 20 million and has posted rewards for people suspected of wildlife trafficking and international smuggling , among other crimes . This is the first reward offered under the program for this type of cybercrime .
Shawn Henry , a retired executive assistant director of the FBI and president of CrowdStrike Services , a security technology company , said it 's challenging to find suspects in cyber cases , and a reward can attract tips . But other tactics , such as negotiations among governments , also are needed to deter attacks , they said .
`` Time will tell whether this is a successful tactic or not , '' Henry said . `` It 's a strategy , and it 's certainly not the sole strategy . ''

Now playing : Watch this : Samsung has plans to bring back the Note 7
Do n't call it a comeback . Call it a minor miracle .
Samsung on Monday said it 's considering selling recalled Galaxy Note 7 devices as refurbished or rental phones `` where applicable . '' But there 's at least one place you wo n't see them again .
`` Samsung will not be offering refurbished Galaxy Note 7 devices for rent or sale in the US , '' a Samsung spokesperson told CNET .
The spokesperson added that product details including the name , technical specifications and price range will be announced when the device is available .
Samsung recalled the phone -- twice -- last year after it was found to have the uncomfortably high tendency to overheat and catch fire , incurring an estimated cost of $ 3 billion for the company . After the second recall , Samsung scrapped the phone , and that was supposed to be end of that .
Until Monday .
The comment opens the door to the unlikeliest of comebacks . Samsung had seemingly put the issue to bed in January by disclosing the cause of the fires -- two different incidents with its two suppliers -- and appeared ready to move on . The company , after all , is set to unveil its Galaxy S8 phone on Wednesday . The possibility of its return is music to the ears of hardcore Note 7 fans , many of whom stubbornly clung to their phones until the end .
The announcement was made as part of a three-point plan that also includes salvaging components for re-use and extracting metals using environmentally friendly methods .
Samsung 's statement addressed questions posed by environmentalists about how the company would dispose of the 4.3 million recalled units . Greenpeace , for instance , sent protestors to Samsung 's press conference at the Mobile World Congress trade show last month to demand answers .
`` While we welcome this news , Samsung must share as soon as possible more detailed timelines on when it will implement its promises , as well as how it intends to change its production system to make sure this never happens again , '' Jude Lee , global senior campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia , said in a statement on Monday .
If you 're looking for a Note 7 , the details on when and where they 'll show up are still fuzzy . Samsung said it would talk with regulatory authorities and carriers , as well as look at the local demand .
Samsung said it also plans to join the European Union 's research and development and test efforts to develop new eco-friendly processing methods .
First published at 8:31 a.m. PT .
Update , 12:04 p.m. PT : Added comments from Samsung clarifying the refurbished model wo n't be available in the United States .
CNET Magazine : Check out a sampling of the stories you 'll find in CNET 's newsstand edition .
Life , disrupted : In Europe , millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle . Tech should be part of the solution . But is it ? CNET investigates .
History might have been very different had the baby boy born on New Year 's Day 1511 survived beyond the first perilous months of infancy . Starkey records that two hundred and seven pounds of gunpowder were used to celebrate the child 's birth .
Little Prince Henry , Duke of Cornwall lived for fifty-two days . They were buried at the end of February . Catherine although they became pregnant readily enough either miscarried or produced infants who died : seven in all . Sir Loyalheart still wore lover 's knots on their jousting armour but the much-needed heir had yet to make an appearance . By 1514 the first rumours of a possible divorce were bandied about but in 1516 Princess Mary was born and there was renewed optimism .
In the meantime Henry went to war with the French and Katherine became regent of England and Wales . It was they who was in charge of England when the Earl of Surrey fought and won the Battle of Flodden . Meanwhile Henry 's father-in-law let them down with regard to France . Ferdinand signed a peace deal with the French having inveigled Henry into a war against them . It can not have helped their daughter 's marital relations . Ultimately Henry would marry their youngest sister to King Louis XII of France . Spain went from being an ally to an enemy . Later Henry would propose that their daughter Mary , should marry to cement a French alliance when all Catherine wanted was for their daughter to marry their nephew , Charles , the son of Juana and Philip .
Charles V was a disappointment to their aunt . Catherine worked carefully after Princess Mary 's proxy marriage to the French dauphin in 1518 to bring their own plans about . They visited England and in 1523 launched an invasion of France along with the English but they failed to fulfil their side of the deal . Then Charles won the Battle of Pavia against the French and dropped the English because they no longer needed them . They deserted their aunt as well .
There had been other changes over the years . Henry came to rely on Wolsey during their time in France in 1513 . They did n't turn to Catherine so readily for advice when they returned to England . In 1515 Wolsey became Lord Chancellor . They would remain at the heart of Henry 's government until their fall in 1529 .
If Catherine was finding life difficult with Henry and with shifting European politics they gave no sign of it . In fact they became increasingly popular with their English subjects . There had been riots in May 1517 and Catherine had interceded on behalf of the condemned apprentices .
Catherine 's last known pregnancy occurred in 1518 . By 1523 their good looks had faded and she 'd become somewhat on the fat side . Francis I of France described them as “ old and deformed. ” Then , to add injury to insult , in 1525 Henry unveiled a son . Henry Fitzroy was Henry 's son with Bessie Blount and they were six years old . Catherine was not amused . The row was tremendous . If only she 'd realised it , things were about to get worse . In 1525 Henry stopped sleeping , it would appear , with Catherine . They may also have put their current mistress Mary Boleyn to one side .
In May 1527 the King 's Great Matter was discussed . Henry wanted to be rid of their Spanish wife . They wanted a divorce . They claimed that they were concerned for their immortal soul . They should never have married their brother 's wife . They felt that their childlessness- because clearly girls did n't count- was a consequence of their sin . They also wanted to marry Anne Boleyn who 'd refused to become their mistress .
Poor Catherine had lost their looks , their fertility , their political influence and now they were going to lose their husband .

Politicians and the public in Britain woke up to news that the US president had verbally attacked the leader of its closest ally – and many were not happy
'Evil racist ' : how the UK reacted to Trump 's Theresa May Twitter attack
Britain woke up on Thursday morning to find the British-American special relationship under threat after Donald Trump launched a scathing overnight attack on Theresa May , dismissively telling them not to criticise him .
The president 's public outburst was a response to Downing Street 's earlier statement calling them out for retweeting videos from the far-right group Britain First , which the prime minister 's spokesperson said used “ hateful narratives that peddle lies and stoke tensions ” .
The US president responded in a tweet on Wednesday evening :
Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) . @ Theresa_May , do n't focus on me , focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom . We are doing just fine !
British politicians , including senior members of May 's government , were quick to respond . Sajid Javid , the secretary of state for communities and local government , had criticised Trump 's initial tweet .
Sajid Javid ( @ sajidjavid ) So POTUS has endorsed the views of a vile , hate-filled racist organisation that hates me and people like me . They are wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing
Fellow Conservatives echoed their views . George Freeman responded :
George Freeman MP ( @ Freeman_George ) Well said Saj . This is a sad & low moment for the West , & AngloAmerican relations , which betrays a deep ignorance of the very real challenges of tackling the insidious rise of extremism and prejudice that threatens us all . https : //t.co/0Yc3q1ShGB
The Tory MP for Romsey and Southampton North , Caroline Nokes , tweeted that they were “ Proud to stand with Javid ” on the issue .
The Liberal Democrat leader , Vince Cable , described Trump as an “ evil racist ” in a tweet , urging May to end a “ humiliating dependence of # Brexit Britain on goodwill of evil racist . Cancel visit . ”
Vince Cable ( @ vincecable ) New @ realDonaldTrump insult to @ theresa_may . They must end humiliating dependence of # Brexit Britain on goodwill of evil racist . Cancel visit
The UK 's former transport secretary , Andrew Adonis , said they could not think of “ a more insulting or destructive public communication from a US president to a British PM since the American civil war ” . May should summon the American ambassador to London , they added .
Andrew Adonis ( @ Andrew_Adonis ) I hope the Prime Minister will now summon the United States Ambassador and tell them the President 's statements are unacceptable . I can not think of a more insulting or destructive public communication from a US President to a British PM since the American civil war !
The director of communications for May 's Conservative party , Carrie Symonds , was not impressed either , pointing out that Trump had first used the wrong Twitter handle for May . “ And that 's just the start , ” they said .
Carrie Symonds ( @ carriesymonds ) Wrong twitter handle . And that 's just the start pic.twitter.com/Vzw3mA905v
British MPs queued up to suggest that Trump 's planned state visit to the UK should be cancelled . The Labour MP for Rhonda Chris Bryant tweeted :
Chris Bryant ( @ RhonddaBryant ) Trump has now deliberately and knowingly lined themselves up behind the fascist group Britain First . They are not welcome .
Matthew Pennycook MP said :
Matthew Pennycook MP ( @ mtpennycook ) Enough is enough . Trump was offered a state visit with unseemly haste . After the events of the past 24 hours the idea it can go ahead is preposterous . The Prime Minister must cancel it . Simple as that .
John Woodcock MP described Trump as “ an unedifying disgrace ” who “ diminishes their great office ” .
The Conservative MP Hugo Swire suggested that Trump might face a tough time with the public if they did come to the UK , tweeting :
Hugo Swire ( @ HugoSwire ) Think when Trump comes over , if they do come over , they should get to meet some of the locals !
On Thursday morning , the prime minister 's office said it would not yet respond to Trump 's tweet directed at May , but that it stood by its earlier statement calling them out for retweeting Britain First . May 's spokesperson also made clear Trump 's planned state visit to London still stood , although pressure was growing for them to rescind the invite .
Meral Hussein-Ece , a Liberal Democrat peer , summed up what appeared to be many people 's feelings on the issue :
Baroness Hussein-Ece ( @ meralhece ) So this is the 'Special Relationship ' between US & UK ? - involves promoting UK facist hate groups , then telling UK PM where to go when they offer the mildest of rebukes ?
Brendan Cox , the widower of the former Labour MP Jo Cox whose killer shouted “ Britain first ” before they shot and stabbed her , called on Trump to take their own advice to May and focus on US domestic problems :
Brendan Cox ( @ MrBrendanCox ) You have a mass shooting every single day in your country , your murder rate is many times that of the UK , your healthcare system is a disgrace , you ca n't pass anything through a congress that you control . I would focus on that . https : //t.co/SNcqOZGvLQ
In the US , a member of Trump 's party , Senator Orrin Hatch , the second highest ranking official of the Senate , also appeared to rally to May 's defence , calling them “ one of the great world leaders ” .
Hatch met May last week to discuss security threats .
Senator Hatch Office ( @ senorrinhatch ) “ PM @ theresa_May is one of the great world leaders , I have incredible love and respect for them and for the way they lead the United Kingdom , especially in the face of turbulence. ” -OGH

The attention Trump has drawn to Britain First 's deputy leader , Jayda Fransen , appears to have boosted their social media popularity . Research by Hope Not Hate has suggested that the far-right have been successful in exploiting terrorist attacks in the UK to gain social media followers .
HOPE not hate ( @ hopenothate ) Donald Trump has been retweeting Britain First leader and rampant anti-Muslim activist Jayda Fransen . See how their online following has spiked following recent terror attacks : https : //t.co/Zx2aj0KzZk pic.twitter.com/5I8llyLm4M
According to Hope Not Hate 's data , Fransen had just 6,000 Twitter followers in March . By November this had reached 52,000 . In the last 24 hours since Trump 's retweets , Fransen has gained an additional 26,000 followers .
Britain First has also sought to capitalise on the exposure . Its Facebook page has 1.9m likes , and on Wednesday it changed its cover photo to a picture of Donald Trump , before making multiple posts boasting about the president 's retweets .

The Twitter spat , though , might also provide an unexpected boost to May 's faltering popularity at home .
At some point , the unthinkable becomes the inevitable . That moment — leaving the euro zone — may be coming for Greece now that its latest bailout battle with Europe has degenerated into the fiscal equivalent of trench warfare . It 's bad enough that Greece 's ruling party , Syriza , has resorted to calling a referendum next Sunday on whether or not Greeks should accept Europe 's terms .
If Greece votes yes , there would probably be new elections and another bailout . But if Greece votes no , it would probably have to ditch the euro and bring back its old currency , the drachma . In the meantime , though , Athens is closing the country 's banks and preventing people from moving much money abroad in a capitulation to the panic gripping its financial system . That became its only option after the European Central Bank announced on Sunday that it would n't approve any more emergency loans to Greece 's banks .

Thanassis Stavrakis/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue .
Now it might be hard to believe , but Greece and Europe really are n't that far apart on a deal . Europe wants Greece to cut its pensions more than it already has — which , in some cases , has been as much as 40 percent — but Greece wants to cut them only half as much and make up the rest with higher taxes on businesses . In other words , both sides agree how much austerity Athens should do , just not how it should do it .
The problem , as it always has been , is the politics . Syriza insists that it has `` red lines '' over pension cuts it can not cross , but Europe has quite literally drawn red lines through them and said , take it or leave it . This hard-line stance is more about warning anti-austerity parties in Spain and Portugal that there 's nothing to be gained from challenging the continent 's budget-cutting status quo as it is about the 1.8 billion euros in pension cuts — not even a rounding error in the context of Europe 's economy — that it wants from Greece . Both sides feel like they ca n't negotiate any more , so they 're not .
Greece may default on its debts if a deal for more funding in exchange for fiscal reforms is not made . Here 's why that matters . ( Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post )
So now , to use a technical term , all hell is about to break loose . The immediate problem is that , without a deal , Greece does n't have the cash to pay the International Monetary Fund the 1.5 billion euros it 's supposed to on Tuesday . So it will likely default , or , to put it a little more politely , be `` in arrears . ''
The bigger problem , though , is Greece 's banks . They 're already in a precarious enough position that they need ECB-approved emergency loans just to stay afloat . But if there is n't an agreement , then the current bailout will also expire on Tuesday — Europe ruled out any kind of extension — and the ECB 's self-proclaimed rules would prohibit it from allowing any more loans to Greece 's banks . And so the banks had no choice but to close after this , in fact , happened .
Now it 's worth pointing out that the ECB does really have some discretion here . This is only a rule it 's given itself . If it wanted to , it could keep authorizing more loans for Greece 's banks , at least until the referendum . But it does n't want to . It 's already announced that it wo n't allow any more than the 89 billion euros of emergency loans it already has for Greece 's banks . About the only consolation is that the ECB says it `` stands ready to reconsider its decision '' if , reading between the lines , Greece backs down and accepts Europe 's offer .
The result is that Greece 's banks are facing their own financial crisis . There 's been a slow-motion bank run the past few months — a bank jog , really — that 's picked up pace the past few days as it 's looked like there would n't be a deal . After all , even in the best-case scenario that there was only going to be a bank holiday , it makes sense to take out whatever money you might need in the next week or so . But in the worst scenarios , like a euro exit or bank bail-in where deposits are taken away , the rational thing is to pull all your money out as soon as possible . If you did n't , then your old euros might either get turned into new drachmas that would n't be worth anywhere near as much , or get expropriated to fill the hole in your bank 's balance sheet .
These low-level worries have turned to outright panic , though , with all the uncertainty around the referendum . Greeks swamped their ATMs on Saturday to get as much money out as they could ahead of the vote . It was enough that , according to Reuters , more than a third of the country 's ATMs ran out of cash at some point during the day . It 's no surprise , then , that the government will close the banks on Monday and keep them closed for at least a few more days after that . They would fail otherwise . Not only that , but the government will stop people from moving their money out of the country — what economists call capital controls — to try to ease some of the strain on the financial system .
These are n't exactly ideal conditions — closed banks and a debt default — for holding a vote on your country 's economic future . But then again , if the euro were working , there 'd be no need for a plebiscite on it . And make no mistake , that is what the referendum is about . If the Greek people vote no , like their government will , then there wo n't be any more ECB loans or bailout money coming , and the only way to get the money their banks need would be to print it . Greece does n't have money to print , though . It has the euro . So it 'd have to get rid of the common currency and bring back the drachma .
Now , it seems hard to believe things could get any worse for a country with 25 percent unemployment , but , in the short-term , they would . The new currency would plummet , inflation would jump into the double digits , imported essentials like gas and food might need to be rationed , businesses that borrowed in euros would default , and the government would have to balance its budget immediately . Why would Syriza do this ? Well , because it would move the economic light at the end of the tunnel into the middle of it . In a year or two , this pain would pass and Greece would be left with a cheaper drachma that would make its exports more competitive and its tourism more attractive . The economy would start to recover , and fast .
But if the Greek people vote yes , like the polls suggest they might , then it 'd be more of the same . Austerity would continue , and the recovery would likely be nasty , brutish and long . About the only difference is that Greece might be reduced to being a once and future full member of the common currency , like Cyprus was , with euros that were n't quite euros but were n't quite not euros , since they probably would n't be allowed to take them anywhere outside the country . Well , that and the fact that they 'd need a new government . Europe does n't trust Syriza to implement any kind of austerity agenda and would either demand or force Greece to call new elections .
The real problem is that Greece 's people want the euro , but they do n't want the austerity that goes with it . That 's why , even though it might seem irresponsible , the referendum may serve a good purpose if it puts an end to this incoherence . But the question now is whether there will even be anything to vote on next Sunday . That 's because Europe says it 's going to pull its offer Tuesday night . That 's its way of trying to pressure Greece into canceling the referendum by making it pointless . And it might work . It did the last time a Greek government called for one back in 2011 . History might repeat itself , first as tragedy and then as farcical tragedy .
If Greece does leave the euro , though , it will in large part be because Europe thinks that Pandora 's Box is empty . In other words , nothing bad would happen to Spain or Portugal or France or Germany . Why would n't it ? Well , Europe bailed out the banks that had lent money to Greece under the guise of bailing out Greece itself , so there should n't be any contagion to the financial system . And the ECB has not only begun buying other country 's bonds , but also promised to buy as many as it takes to keep their borrowing costs down , so there should n't be any contagion to the other crisis countries , either . That 's all true , but it might not be true enough . As long as Greece is part of the euro , Europe can punish it for any perceived fiscal sins as a warning to everyone else : Do as we say , or suffer . But if Greece leaves and then recovers quickly , that lesson will be lost .
The euro was supposed to be irreversible , just like the Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable . It helps if you try to avoid the icebergs , and not insist that you can survive them .
In late June , the U.S. military and the U.S. intelligence community had concluded that a shadowy network of al Qaeda veterans in Syria were planning to attack airliners flying to the United States .
Within the American government , the threat was considered serious enough that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command—the Pentagon 's elite hunter-killers—prepared detailed targeting packages for the group , with the specific locations of the group 's leaders . But those plans never made it to the White House , according to senior U.S. intelligence and Pentagon leaders .
“ There was sufficient targeting information on these guys in June , ” said one senior U.S. intelligence official . “ It was good information on whom , what , and where and there was an acknowledgment of this at the highest levels . ”
The new disclosure that Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) had prepared target packages against al Qaeda 's cell comes as some critics on the left and right have questioned whether the White House invented the threat from the so-called “ Khorasan Group ” in order to justify airstrikes that began in September against al Qaeda and ISIS targets in Syria . Skepticism has also mounted because U.S. officials have walked back claims in the last week that the strikes on the Khorasan Group were an attempt to disrupt an imminent threat .
Jenan Moussa of Al-Aan Television this week reported that the Khorasan Group was actually an elite unit within al Qaeda 's Syrian franchise , which has been focused on its fight inside the country . Other U.S. officials tell The Daily Beast that the group is composed of senior al Qaeda planners focused on attacking the West .
Senior and mid-level U.S. intelligence and defense officials who have tracked the threat tell The Daily Beast that the alarm raised about the Khorasan Group came from within the intelligence community and particularly from the U.S. military 's special operations task forces that monitor al Qaeda and the Levant . “ The senior leadership in the military did n't want to ask the question when they knew the answer would be ‘ no , ' ” said the senior U.S. intelligence official quoted earlier about why the targeting packages were not sent to the White House in June .
It 's true that inside the U.S. government the teams of analysts and operators that track terrorist leaders are often the strongest advocates for going after their targets . But in this case , the broader U.S. intelligence community was frustrated with a White House that had ruled out any kind of Syrian intervention . It 's easy to see why many spies and military officers were left with this impression . In late June and early July , President Obama had not even authorized airstrikes in Iraq even though the Iraqi government had asked them for those strikes . While the White House did approve in early July an attempted rescue mission to save Western journalists captured by ISIS , there was no expectation that the president was even close to authorizing lethal strikes against a terrorist network that no U.S. officials had even spoken about yet in public .
Nonetheless , by late June the threat from the Khorasan Group was considered real . Three U.S. intelligence officials told The Daily Beast that a warning to airlines from the Transportation Safety Administration ( TSA ) issued on July 2 to improve screening of passengers on direct flights to the United States was a response to the perceived threat from the Khorasan Group . At the time , The New York Times reported the warning was in response to a threat from al Qaeda 's franchise based in Yemen , whose bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri specializes in the hard-to-detect bombs suspected to be an element of the Khorasan Group 's attack plan .
The public warnings to airlines , according to these sources , prompted the Khorasan Group to go dark and change their communications . As The Daily Beast reported last week , the plot from the summer was believed to target commercial airliners with non-metallic bombs . One House member reached by The Daily Beast this week said the U.S. intelligence briefers told lawmakers that the plot that prompted the TSA warning in July was the same threat used to justify the airstrikes last week .
The White House declined to comment for this piece on the record . But one senior White House official said it received no target packages on the Khorasan Group in June . “ The one time the White House received a recommendation to strike a Khorasan target in Syria , the President authorized that strike , ” this official said .
After last week 's airstrike , Jihadist websites reported that two of the group 's leaders , Muhsin al-Fadhli and Abu Yousef al-Turki , were killed . But thus far the U.S. military and the intelligence community have not been able to confirm this .
One problem for the U.S. intelligence community is that it has no American intelligence officers on the ground in Syria to assess the areas where U.S. missiles hit , according to two intelligence officials . Instead , these officials say , the U.S. must rely on Jordanian assets and Kurdish f ighters in Syria for on the ground information .
Some U.S. intelligence officials also suspect deception . “ This could be false information from these Jihadist web forums , ” a senior U.S. defense official said . “ We do n't have people on the ground , so it 's hard to know . ”
If true , this would not be the first time a suspected target of U.S. airstrikes faked their own death . In 2009 , al Qaeda senior military planner Ilyas Kashmiri gave an interview to the Asia Times only a few weeks after the CIA had concluded they were killed in a drone strike in Pakistan . U.S. drones finally caught up to Kashmiri in 2011 .
The trio all currently race in the LMP2 class of the global endurance series - Derani and Giovinazzi for Extreme Speed Motorsports and Menezes for Signatech Alpine - and will be getting their first taste of LMP1 machinery on 20 November , the day after the season finale .
Derani will sample the Toyota TS050 Hybrid , while Giovinazzi will get behind the wheel of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro and Menezes will drive the Porsche 919 Hybrid .
All three manufacturers also have the opportunity to test other drivers during the rookie test if they wish , while any other team racing in the 6 Hours of Bahrain will also have the opportunity to test .
“ The rookie test is a fantastic opportunity for these three up-and-coming endurance drivers to test an LMP1 prototype , the most technologically advanced race cars in the world , '' said WEC CEO Gerard Neveu .
`` We looked in depth at drivers from within the world of endurance racing before making the selection , and believe that Pipo Derani , Antonio Giovinazzi and Gustavo Menezes fully deserved the opportunity to demonstrate their talent and potential .
`` This rookie test will give drivers an added bonus to their season , and forms an important element in the progressive career path available within the endurance family . ”
While GP2 points leader Giovinazzi makes their WEC debut this weekend at Fuji , Derani won both the Sebring 12 Hours and Daytona 24 Hours outright early this year , while Menezes took class victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours in June .
In a few short weeks , we 're going to close out the 2013th year of our Lord . While the U.S. media is busy debating the ethnicity of they and their fat bastard uncle , Santa , we here at Blade or Die hope you get nothing but freshies in your stocking or under your Festivus pole .
From saying goodbye to BCSD to watching Richie Eisler 's backside on a Vancouver bridge go viral , it was yet another stellar year of rollerblading history .
This year 's awards are dedicated to the memory of Brandon Negrete , who continually made our sport look its best by pushing skaters and blade media to inspire us Forever ( Negrete ) . You will be missed but never forgotten .
Without further ado , here are Blade or Die 's annual recognition of some of the best in a year of blade .
( But do n't forget to check out ONE Magazine 's Awards as well . )
Skater of the Year : Richie Eisler
This designation from this site is long overdue , mainly because Richie has been steadily slaying the blade game for a long time now . While 2013 was no different , their skating managed to possess the blading finesse to make Danny Beer 's edit of their skating in Vancouver to go viral , which , as we all know is no small feat .
Richie snagged up a few contest wins while continue to skate the globe like it 's their backyard p-rail , so there 's not much else to say that has n't already been said . You can read more of my perspectives on Richie in Blader Digest : How Richie Eisler Saved Rollerblading Forever .
Congratulations , Richie . You certainly earned it . Just wish there was money to go with it , but hopefully you accept IOUs .
Edit of the Year : Billy O'Neill SSM
Now , it may seem a bit strange to talk heavily about a guy 's edit that got so much attention and then not give them edit of the year , but unless you forgot , Fish put out this wonderment of blading spectacles five months ago thanks to the Hatian Mag kids .
It 's two-and-a-half minutes of classically pure Fish style and hammers , but even decades after their name became known , the man continues to push themselves and our sport into dizzying blends of stupidity , malice , and ballsiness .
In one edit , they essentially retired the Staples Center ledge by filling in the details of their Hatian Mag cover shot , and went between , over , around , and under some sketchy and weird rail spots .
Oh , now we jump over rails to get to shit now . Death gap not good enough ? Oh , 270 over one rail so you can top soul another ? That 's fine . No really , that 's real fucking fine ! Thanks , Bill . I 'll be right there behind you .
I 'll put it this way , from one New Yorker to another…
Bill , you 're a sick , sick fucking guy , but I 'll leave that burly Evil Knevil shit to you .
But , for group edits , you ca n't beat the Valo X Strange edit from this fall…
Blade Duo of the Year : Franky and E. Rod
It 's not just one edit combining the physics- and body-contorting blading from Franky Moralaes and flavorful capturing and editing styles of Erick Rodriguez , but it was a year full of them .
Just to see where the two are going—just on mere aesthetics alone—check out 0:19 to 0:23 of their latest edit . ( If you 're smart , you 'll watch , or have already watched , the full thing . )
And just for fun , check out the one they released two weeks before that one .
Gives me the damn shivers . Ca n't wait to see what they have in store for 2014 .
There 's another edit from E. Rod below , so do n't click away too fast .
Video of the Year : Valo V
We 've all talked about this already , and I 've already written about it enough , so let 's keep this short and sweet . The long-awaited next Valo team video after 4Life did not disappoint . With the addition of David Sizemore , the scale and veracity of the team 's skating , as well as the B-roll from their numerous travels and interactions , was a complete joy to watch .
The content of the film aside , you could buy copies of the video , complete with photo book casing , immediately after the premiere at the theater . RIGHT AFTER THE VIDEO WAS PREMIERED ! ! !
Every time Ivan puts out a video , they have to put together some fancy shit . Since their last two videos came with books , I 'm curious to see what the slippery fucker has planned next .
For the rest of the team , I ca n't think of a single one of them—Bailey and Broskow to Itchy and Cosi—whose skating does n't make my palms awkwardly sweaty .
NOTE : Shout out to El_CHVPO for utilizing available technology to allow for cheap rentals or downloads . Read more about it at Be-Mag and why it 's the best $ 2 you can spend all year .
Section of the Year : Victor Arias in Valo V
This fucking guy .
Long ago , Victor Arias made their name on control and style ( a rarity for someone as tall as they are ) . Maturing off somewhere on a horse ranch , the man shines any moment a camera is pointed at them ( or he 's pointing it at others as Ivan 's main second-filmer [ or first , depending on who is telling the story ] ) .
Victor 's section stacked hammer on hammer , leaving one to wonder if the last trick was n't the ender , what was coming next . And what came next , in rapid fire succession , is an edit that will be replayed and reposted for the next decade and with great merit .
I 'd post a video of it , but since I try to keep inter-blader piracy and thievery to a minimum , you 'll have to buy it yourself or borrow it from a friend to see what you 've been missing out on , or at least missing since you last saw it .
Contest of the Year : BSCD
I 'm not there right now—nor do I have a rational reason to go to Detroit in the winter—but I imagine it 's still so damn cold in the D .
After 13 years and multiple locations , Daniel Kinney turned in their Midwestern winter competition hat and left it open for the younger kids . Me , I was merely at boy when I first met them and they aged me in the process , but damn did I always come back with a story or two .
BCSD , we 'll always miss you , but we 'll never forget you , too .
Honorable mention : Blading Cup . Shit 's hella fun . You should go . Fuck , some Middle Eastern lifestyle magazine printed a story about it along with a fucking Hobbit . How fucking cool is that ?
( Again , sorry for the lack of international contests in here , but I 've never been to one and I ca n't endorse something I 've never experienced , like heroin . Now that I 'm free at the end of February , feel free to send me a plane ticket to Winterclash and I 'll check it out . )
Best Facial Hair : Jan Welch and Matthias St. John
Since everyone and their brother is rocking a beard now ( myself included ) , you better grow something gnarly to get noticed . Jan and Matthias are no newcomers . They did n't throw away their razor for Movember or any other silly testicle-related endeavor . No , these men are pioneers of their craft .
Both could host a commune of birds and squirrels with room to spare . ( I think it might have something to do with hanging out with B . Free . Somebody should look into that . )
Best Non-Skate Product : Cupron Socks
For my day job , I write about health and science stuff , so people are always sending me stuff , from self-help books to “ miracle cures. ” About a month ago , Cupron Socks sent me two pairs of their diabetic socks . I 'm not diabetic , but I started using them on their claims that they kill the fungus that kills athletes foot . Hell , they worked for Chilean miners trapped below the Earth 's surface , so surely they could handle some blade fungus .
If you 've ever been around me long enough , you know my feet are disgusting . After years of going from skates to boots without a shower in the middle , there 's some funky stuff going on down there . ( Hell , I clouded up Bambrick 's house so bad after BCSD I was nearly thrown into a snow bank . )
Besides the cushy padding , the copper oxide built into the socks has really helped my feet from making my girlfriend 's eyes water after walking a few miles each day . So that pays for itself .
While you might think it 's a bit ridiculous to pay $ 40 for three pairs of socks , it 's a hell of a lot better than dishing out $ 8 a week for a can of Tinactin and your bathroom floor wo n't look like you have a blow problem .
Team of the Year : USD
The Yankees of rollerblading , USD pays its skaters well , and for that cash , they 're expected to produce results . And they did .
Everyone on the USD pro team pulled hard this year . Besides the asupervisorstioned Richie and Frankie , there 's still Jeff Dalnas , Demetrios George , Nick Lomax , and Matheiu Ledoux .
Oh yeah , let 's not forget Montre Livingston , another contender for skater of the year . The man is one of the best crowd pleasers to ever hit the game . Fast , big , and always cheesing , Montre is always a damn fine representation about everything good about blading .
Check out the rest of the team 's year on The Conference 's Vimeo page .
Scene of the Year : JSF ( Yes , Two Years in a Row )
From documenting the game and pushing it forward , these band of miscreants are my family , my brothers from other mothers , and a crew whose influence spans from the top of Rollerblade , Valo , and Razor down to the scummy depths of Fester , SSM , and numerous other brands .
These guys are the best , can keep a contest hype at full volume for days , and could probably out-smoke some of the gnarliest veteran potheads on the game .
Three of us—Ivan , B. Smith , and myself—were named ONE Magazines videographer , photographer , and writer of the year , respectively , so we have that going for us as well .
A big congrats to Erick “ El Presidente ” Garcia for once again upping the skitching game . Again , if you have n't seen Valo V , you should even if it 's just to watch ESG skitch Bay Bridge morning traffic behind B. Smith 's motorcycle .
It 's JSF as fuck .
Blade or Die ( and Happy New Year )

P.S.—If you have n't read my books , you should . Besides , I 'll be hitting you all up for money for the next one soon , anyway .

David J. Trone , seen in March 2016 , announced they will run for the congressional seat being vacated by Rep. John Delaney ( D-Md. ) . ( Marlon Correa/El Tiempo Latino )
Rep. John Delaney 's decision to forgo reelection next year has triggered a burst of interest in what is arguably Maryland 's only congressional swing district .
On Wednesday , wine magnate David J. Trone and state Sen. Roger Manno announced that they would compete in June 's Democratic 6th District primary , joining state House Majority Leader Bill Frick , Del . Aruna Miller and retired intelligence officer Andrew Duck — who twice ran for the seat years ago , when it was firmly in Republican hands .
Republicans could have a race on their hands , as well . Matt Mossburg , a former delegate , is running , and Amie Hoeber , Delaney 's 2016 challenger , is considering it .
The filing deadline is in February .
Delaney , who announced Friday that they would seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 , has represented the 6th District since 2012 , when they ousted longtime incumbent Roscoe G. Bartlett ( R ) after a partisan redistricting effort that is now under court challenge .

The Democrat barely defeated Republican Dan Bongino in 2014 , when Gov . Larry Hogan 's surprise victory boosted GOP turnout . But Delaney easily triumphed over Hoeber in November , even though they had support from the national party .
The redrawn district stretches from Montgomery County through Western Maryland . Of the candidates running so far , only Duck , Miller and Mossburg live in the 6th District , which candidates are not required to do . The others live in the neighboring 8th District , as does Delaney . Only Manno would commit to moving to the 6th District if elected .
Trone , who lives in Potomac , spent more than $ 13 million of their own money running for a different seat in Congress last year , losing to then-state Sen. Jamie B. Raskin in the 8th District primary , one of the most expensive House nominating contests ever .
They are expected to open their checkbook again this time and has vowed to reject campaign contributions from corporations , lobbyists or political action committees . In a video launching their campaign , Trone said they would “ pick up right where John leaves off . ”
“ I 'll fight President Trump and Congress 's attempts to gut health care , women 's rights , education , the environment and Social Security , ” they say . The video describes Trone 's experience growing up on a family farm that eventually went bankrupt , and they said that if elected , they will seek funding for the National Institutes of Health , based in Bethesda , and transportation projects .
Delaney stopped short of endorsing Trone but issued a statement Wednesday praising their “ deep commitment to both public service and to bringing their business experience to the political debate . ”
Hours after Trone 's announcement , Manno made their campaign official , touting their experience working as a Capitol Hill policy staffer when the Affordable Care Act passed .
Manno , who lives in Silver Spring and who has served in the legislature since 2007 , said they will focus on health care and economic issues in the race .
Frick , of Bethesda , rose to leadership in the state House of Delegates over three terms and said he 's most proud of legislation to increase the state 's reliance on clean energy — which survived a Hogan veto — and to create a mechanism for workplace retirement savings accounts .
Miller , an engineer who lives in Darnestown , was first elected to the legislature in 2010 . They have pushed for bills requiring electronic monitoring of domestic violence perpetrators and extending the statute of limitations for sexual offenses against minors .
They are the only woman so far in the race to join a congressional delegation that has been all-male since the retirement of longtime senator Barbara A. Mikulski and the departure of member of congress Donna F. Edwards last year . There are currently seven Democrats and one Republican member .
Duck , who works at the Pentagon as a contractor and lives in Frederick , Md. , challenged Bartlett in 2006 , 2008 and 2010 and says their campaigns registered enough Democrats to show those voters ' strength as a voting bloc before the district lines were redrawn .
On the Republican side , Mossburg , also of Frederick , served one term as a state delegate in the late 1990s . They said their personal recovery from opioid addiction and advocacy work qualify them to tackle the problem , which is particularly acute in Western Maryland .
Hoeber , who lives in Potomac , is a defense expert who restarted their international affairs consulting business after losing to Delaney last year .
From the start , I have expressed my numerous frustrations with Fox 's new show The Exorcist . The subpar writing and poor attempt at horror have turned an interesting concept into something barely watchable . Adding to the long list is something very noticeable in chapter 4 ; the show struggles with simplicity and consistency . What I mean by this is the show has gone from an interesting take on its source material to a jumbled up story that does n't have the writing to back it up .
What once seemed like a simple , but good , show about a couple of priests helping a troubled family has turned into something that is all over the place , and truthfully not very interesting . This week , for example , starts out with Casey fantasizing about their family without its many problems . Them father is in good health , their sister is in high spirits , and their mom does n't seem so paranoid . It then jumps to them in a hospital psychiatric ward being monitored by doctors because of their sudden outburst on the train last week . The whole time she 's there that mysterious older man is messing with her , both physically and emotionally . And of course , the doctors ca n't figure out what 's wrong with them
While Casey is stuck in the hospital , Father Tomas is still in pursuit of the real problem . Their request for an exorcism was denied by The Church but they still have a plan to go on their own . In the meantime , Father Marcus is off visiting different locations given to them last week by Brother Bennett . They go from seeing an exorcism done by Mother Bernadette to a Chicago bus tour featuring the city 's most horrific murders .
The whole time chapter 4 of the Exorcist sets out to try and find the root cause of all the evil . Why is Chicago possessed by so demons ? Is there something specifically attractive about the city , or is just a revolving problem ? Through their investigation , Father Marcus finds evidence for both . They are shown newspaper clipping of past horrific events in Chicago , but we have also seen proof that this evil has appeared other places too .
Admittedly , however , the episode then ends with some interesting events . First , we see Father Marcus performing an exorcism in the presence of Mother Bernadette ( Deanna Dunagan ) with some success . They then meets up with Father Tomas , where they both agree to go against The Church and perform an exorcism on Casey who was just released from the hospital . The episode ends with Casey chained up in a padded room and Father Marcus saying “ let us begin . ”
If it sounds like a lot , it 's because it is . The show has taken some unnecessary steps to get to the part of the story we 've been waiting for . If there is anything redeeming about this week 's episode , though , it would be the ending . It looks like the show is starting to make some much-anticipated progress and we might finally start seeing some real horror . If it can use the momentum gained from this weeks ending , The Exorcist might become more than just watchable .
Score : 6/10

Blog City Dallas Frontier Town to Economic Juggernaut
The meteoric rise of Dallas over the 175 years of its history is nothing short of breathtaking . The city 's enterprising inhabitants have led the world in a succeeding range of fields , from ranching to oil extraction , manufacturing and high technology , vastly enriching the city and shaping the skyline we see today . Though the city has endured dark days of depression , assassinations , wars and racism , the economic triumph of Dallas can be seen in the imperious towers that dominate the city 's skyline today . Before Dallas was the metropolis we know today , it spent thousands of years as home to the indigenous Caddo people and their farmsteads and hamlets dotted the region . The region was claimed by the Spanish in the late 1500s , but this was a claim in name only , and for hundreds of years only the odd adventure-seeking European passed through the region . It was only in the mid-19th Century , a couple years after Texas declared independence from Mexico , that the first permanent European settlers arrived at the side of the Trinity River , led by the enterprising John Neely Bryan . In 1841 they founded what would become Dallay , and for years it remained little more than a tiny far-flung outpost of Euro-American settlement , continuing in this modest manner for some time after Texas was incorporated into the United States in 1845 . Gradually the town grew on the eastern bank of the Trinity River . At the outbreak of the Civil War , the 1,000 or so voting inhabitants of the town voted resoundingly in favour of secession from the United States . Dallas itself was not drastically affected by the course of the war , but Reconstruction and the emancipation of the slaves changed the cultural landscape , with black Freedmen 's towns popping up around the region . The arrival of both a north-south and east-west railway in 1872 was a watershed moment in the city 's history , and the population more than doubled in the course of a single year . Dallas had begun its meteoric rise to prominence as the main commercial and transportation hub of eastern Texas . By 1890 it was the most populous city in the state , and in this period of prosperity ( barring the Depression of the mid-1890s ) many of the older buildings we can see in this photo essay were erected , such as the ‘ Old Red ' courthouse . Dallas in the early 20th Century was n't just a hub for commerce and railways , it also became a place of high fashion and ambitious architecture . Buildings like the Neiman Marcus department store attest to the city 's affluence and stature . The discovery of oil in the 1930s enriched the city 's inhabitants and prompted the construction of imposing and impressive corporate headquarters in the downtown core . Manufacturing and high technology innovation helped continue the city 's economic rise throughout the latter half of the 20th Century , though the Savings and Loan Crisis of the 1980s had a catastrophic effect on the city 's economy . Dallas 's corporate success has shaped the look and feel of the downtown core . As we can see from the photos in this essay , the quaint Old West-style streets and store fronts have been erased in favour of towering corporate headquarters , and indeed one has to dig deep to find traces of much evidence of Dallas 's history . The Now photos are courtesy of Texas photographer Jason Ali , while the Then photos are reproduced from the Southern Methodist University collection , the University of Houston Library Collection , and Christian Spencer Anderson 's Flickr page .

Facebook to Test Its Own PayPal Competitor in Bid to Simplify Mobile Purchases
Facebook plans to test a new payments product that would allow online shoppers to make purchases on mobile apps using their Facebook login information , according to sources familiar with the company 's plans .
The product , sources said , would allow any shopper who has previously provided Facebook with their credit card details to make purchases on partnering e-commerce mobile apps without entering billing information .
Facebook confirmed the test , which is expected to launch in the next month or so , to AllThingsD .
Thrillist-owned JackThreads , a flash-sale shopping site for young men , is the pilot partner . The company has a strong relationship with Facebook , sees a good chunk of revenue come through mobile phone purchases and may also have a decent demographic overlap with one particular segment of Facebook users — gamers — who would have provided the social network with credit card information . It will be interesting to see if Fab , another close partner of Facebook 's that does well on mobile devices , will follow suit .
The new product , if launched widely beyond its current small testing phase , would undoubtedly pit Facebook against digital payments giant PayPal on mobile devices . It would also compete with offerings from Google , Amazon and a host of startups such as Braintree , Stripe and Klarna , all up-and-coming outfits that are working , in one way or another , to make it easier to make purchases on mobile phones . All of these companies , including Facebook , recognize that it can be challenging to easily enter your payment details on small devices .
If eventually expanded to more partners , the product would also potentially give Facebook keen insight into the shopping habits and preferences of the company 's users , a lucrative set of data for the world 's largest social network to gather .
At the same time , Facebook 's test is , for now , focused solely on creating a better mobile checkout experience , rather than getting involved in payment processing . That setup allows partnering commerce companies to still work with payment processors of their choice . Yet , part of the pitch to merchants from companies like PayPal is the simplification of the checkout experience , which Facebook is now going after .
“ It sounds like a dead-on competitor of PayPal , ” said Sucharita Mulpuru , a retail analyst at Forrester Research , after AllThingsD apprised them of Facebook 's plans .
“ We have a great relationship with Facebook and expect that to continue . Our customers love using PayPal on Facebook , ” a PayPal spokesperson said in a statement . “ We 've been investing in mobile payments since 2006 , and last year 10 percent of our total payment volume — $ 14 billion — was from mobile devices . However , we always welcome competition and are looking forward to seeing what Facebook will announce . ”
( Update 12:15 pm ET : Facebook sent the following statement to AllThingsD after publication on Thursday : “ We continue to have a great relationship with PayPal , and this product is simply to test how we can help our app partners provide a simpler commerce experience . This test does not involve moving the payment processing away from an app 's current provider . ” )
The checkout product could also potentially provide Facebook and its advertisers with valuable insight into what type of products its users are buying off of Facebook .
What is unclear , however , is just how many credit cards Facebook actually has on file .
The social giant has also used its Gifts product to bolster the company 's cache of credit card numbers . Launched nearly a year ago , Facebook Gifts allows users to send one another real physical goods via the Facebook platform . In order to purchase items , users need to enter their credit card or PayPal info , which Facebook then stores in perpetuity .
The same goes for the millions of gamers who spend money buying in-game virtual goods while playing on top of the Facebook platform .
While Facebook users can use PayPal to make purchases on the social network , they will need to give Facebook actual credit card information to make purchases using their Facebook login off of Facebook .
Forrester 's Mulpuru said she 'd be surprised if the social network has more than 10 million credit card numbers on file in the U.S .
“ Nobody trusts social networks with their financial information , and they are certainly not going to trust Facebook , ” Mulpuru said . “ Maybe they have a few million people that have bought something on things like FarmVille , but that does not have a network make . ”
It would make more sense , Mulpuru said , for Facebook to allocate resources toward creating a platform for Facebook-centric small businesses that now mainly conduct business through inefficient mediums such as email .
“ PayPal is well-suited because they have more than 100 million accounts with real people who have trusted them with their information . To be a latecomer to the game in something as complex as payments , they would be better off buying Square , ” they said .
As it stands , Facebook 's revenue from payments and other fees totaled $ 214 million in the second quarter , a mere fraction of the company 's billion-dollar ad business .
This is n't the first time Facebook has tried to position itself inside the e-commerce arena . The company launched its Credits initiative in mid-2009 , essentially an attempt to create another form of virtual currency for users to purchase items via the Facebook platform . But the experiment was scrapped in the summer of last year , chalked up to overcomplicating what should be a friction-free , painless process .
Okay I added a little more to my crazy mind blowing theory that probably is nowhere near true but its just fun to think about .
What if Alison is really dead and Aria was their torturer and killer ? And the “ daydream ” Aria had of Ezra being arrested was actually something else that really happened ?
Hear me out .
So , Aria was the one who had the breakdown after they killed Ali and was found to be mentally insane . And the whole show is just Aria 's mind protecting them from the truth that 1 ) they were A , 2 ) they were Ali 's killer and 3 ) Byron , their father , was arrested for their relationship with Ali ( she actually saw them and Alison together instead of Meredith )
Some clues : When they reunited with Emily , they commented that they “ had ” to stay away from each other . Emily said “ we all know she 's dead ” but then Aria says something odd , “ I 've just never heard anyone say it out loud ” .
There are the journals they write . When people go through something traumatic , journaling is a form of therapy . They also once wrote something before it even happened . The guy that came to see Ashley looking for Mrs. Potter 's money . They wrote the dialogue word for word .
Them babysitter they ran into talked to them about wanting to see their writings one day . Aria said they are just journals .
Who goes to Iceland for a year ? How can a teacher and an artist afford taking their family away for a year ? And we know nothing about that trip . Like zero .
The MAYA KNEW clue . Miss Aria , You 're a Killer Not Ezra 's wife . Could be their mind giving them a clue .
The comment Ali made to them in a visit or a dream “ you know why I picked you right ? ” may be a hint that they just picked Aria as a friend to get close to Byron and have an excuse to see him . I mean Aria and Ali did n't really have anything in common .
Meredith could have been their Nurse and their blonde hair reminded them of Ali and that 's why they got all panicky and scared . Mental patients can turn on their caregivers . Maybe that 's why they were so drugged because they attacked their nurse ( Meredith ) . Meredith made the comment to Byron that Aria knows everything . But after Meredith leaves to never return ( and oh btw they just so happens to have a history of mental illness ? ? ! ? ! ? ) then Aria wants to destroy any evidence that would incriminate Byron with Ali . So they burned the diary pages . Maybe they were burning them from their mind because it was their mind trying to tell them the truth about Ali and Byron and they are n't ready to face the ugly truth of it all .
They told Ezra recently that they were writing a story and it 's taking a change . She 's become fascinated with the villain .
They are acting very very strange at Radley .
They drift off a lot . They are always looking out windows and staring into mirrors .
She 's extremely paranoid .
They zone out and comes to like she 's been in a trance .
They have outbursts and fits of rage .
Could Ezra be their therapist and they have fixated on them and having fantasies about them two and that 's why their mind went off on all the spy equipment path and they think he 's watching them and their friends when really he 's just monitoring their behavior and counseling them and writing all this down because he 's their therapist ? And maybe that 's why Ezra disappears off and on because they do n't work 24/7 .
They used to lie on Ezra 's couch a lot and they would be sitting up . Kind of like a patient/therapist thing . Why else does Ezra LISTEN without passing judgement to everything Aria tells him ? They are there to listen and help . Which is what therapists do .
There seems to be a time warp going on in Rosewood . Clocks are always shown . Especially around Aria .
The Lolita thing is really big which points to an Ali/Byron type of relationship .
Aria could be schizophrenic and the other liars could actually be patients in the institution with them Or the liars could be parts of themselves that they have segregated off . Like alternate personalities . Or they are reliving everything in their mind to change the story of how it all goes and ends .
The closer they get to the villain the closer we get to the truth . They said it the other night , the more I look , the closer we get to A . Which may be herself .
This theory could explain a lot of plot holes in rosewood and story lines that are dropped off and people coming and going . ( As Mona said , one girl checks in and another one checks out ) . The weird time passages . This could be why everyone seems to be a suspect and the liars are always being stalked . Schizophrenia causes extreme paranoia . Now that I think about it , I actually believe there are a ton of clues that could support this theory . It 's all in how you look at things . but do I think they show will go this route ? Probably not .
MOTIVE : Aria 's ultimate motive . They were betrayed by their father and the girl they wanted so bad to be best friends with and thought they were but realized they were being used . Aria adored their father . That has been said by Ella before . But this destroyed everything so their mind created an alternate reality . a different story . Mona being A could really be an alternate personality of Aria .
So all the A early activities was Aria a as A/Mona . Lost Woods Resort could have been where Byron and Ali met and Aria/Mona as A spied on them . Which makes sense why the lair is so dark and creepy . It 's someone who hates Ali . The images and the Ali faces with eyes cut out . The dolls . Aria had a lot of dolls at home too . Especially in their basement . The children 's ward at Radley has dolls too . See the correlation . Aria hid themselves in the children 's ward to get away from Meredith ( her nurse ) Also , the videos that everyone is after could be videos of Ali and Byron or videos Byron took of more underage girls . Ali made the statement that the guy she 's with likes to make videos but it turned out they are n't the only one they made videos of .
And all this drove Aria crazy and they killed Alison . Byron was arrested after the truth came out . Aria committed . Ella moved away . Mike , we rarely see . They could have killed himself . We have n't seen Byron in awhile . He 's always traveling .
Aria 's friends were also bullied by Ali and they witnessed it all . Which fueled their hatred for Ali . So their mind is now doing wish fulfillment for their friends . Turning hefty hanna into the IT girl , nerdy loser Mona into a diabolical villain , over-achiever nerd Spencer into a cooler relaxed version who stands up to their family , lovesick weak Emily into a strong powerful and comfortable with their sexuality . Which prior to Ali being “ gone ” they were not any of that . Aria was a little strange with strands of pink hair . Now , she 's beautiful with great style and having super hot romance with their English Teacher ( like their Dad was ) and close to their friends again . Wish fulfillment .
But their mind is naturally dark , so it eventually goes back to the schizophrenia places and paranoia . And the Ali being “ back ” is really wreaking havoc with Aria 's alternate reality they have created for herself . And the truth keeps trying to surface which is why everything gets more and more intense .
I know it 's ultra crazy and a mind trip . Kind of Shutter Island-ish but it 's fun to come up with crack theories because you never know til it 's over .

Status of Artsakh
Artsakh , better known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh , is a former Azerbaijan enclave in Armenia . Still de jure part of Azerbaijan , the territory is de facto under Armenian control .
The Artsakh Republic is no longer an enclave ; in 1996-1994 the Armenian troops occupied the territory located between the former Autonomous Region and the former Armenian SSR , known as the Latchin Corridor of Latchin , and a lot of other adjoining Azerbaijan territory . A ceasefire was obtained on 12 May 1994 through Russian negotiation .
Armenia does not officially recognize Artsakh , though it recognizes its self-determination right and its Army occupies it , as well as a good part of what is generally considered Azeri territory .
According to the Constitution ( text , Armenian ; text , English ) adopted by referendum on 20 February 2017 , the official name of the territory is Republic of Artsakh .
Mikhail Revnivtsev , Luc Baronian , Zach Harden & Jos Poels , 22 March 2017
History of Artsakh
The Armenian claim to Karabakh dates back to the 19th century . Armenians who fled Turkey were settled in Karabakh , apparently unnoticed by the Armenians in the environment of Yerevan . Armenia for them was Eastern Turkey , dominated by the mighty Süphan Dagh volcano , which you see everywhere in Eastern Turkey around Lake Van . After the genocide of 1915 there was not anymore a Turkish Armenia . Only then Armenia sought a Greater Armenia within Russia . It had a war with Georgia about `` Georgian Armenia '' , which was not successful . Before attention was directed towards Karabakh , the area was incorporated into Azerbaijan . According to The Karabakh File by the Zoryan Institute , the English together with the Azeris repulsed Armenian attacks .
On 20 February 1988 the Council of People 's Deputies of the Autonomous Region of Nagorno-Karabakh of Azerbaijan SSR addressed to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR , to the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR , and to the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR a request for the transfer of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region from the Azerbaijan SSR to the Armenian SSR .
On 12 January 1989 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted the Decree `` About introduction of special forms of management in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region of Azerbaijan SSR '' , with effect on 20 January 1989 . The Council of People 's Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region and its Executive Committee were suspended , while their powers were transferred to the newly created Committee of Special Management of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region , directly subordinated to the supreme bodies of the Government of USSR . The Decree , for the first time in the history of the USSR , established a direct control on the territory from Moscow .
The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic was self-proclaimed , within the structure of the USSR , on 2 September 1991 . This was confirmed by a referendum held on 10 December 1991 , After the collapse of the USSR , full independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic was proclaimed on 6 January 1992 .

Flag of Artsakh
The flag and arms of Artsakh were first prescribed in Article 16 of the Constitution ( text ) adopted in the 10 December 2006 referencum , as follows :
1 . The national flag of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic is a tricolor with equal upper-red , the middle-blue , and the lower-orange horizontal stripes with a white five-toothed stepped pattern on the flag which begins from the two verges of the clothÕs right side and is connected on one-third of the flag . Law stipulates the detailed description of the flag .
2 . Law defines the coat of arms and national anthem of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic .
The very same symbols are prescribed in a slightly different wording in the 2017 Constitution ( text )
1 . The flag of the Republic of Artsakh shall be tricolor - with equal horizontal stripes of red , blue , and orange and a white five-toothed stepped pattern on the flag which begins from the two verges of the clothÔs right side and is connected on the one-third of the flag . The detailed description of the flag shall be defined by law .
2 . The coat of arms and national anthem of the Republic of Artsakh shall be defined by law .
The flag is derived from that of Armenia , which is a red-blue-orange horizontal tricolour . The westwards pointing arrow signifies very graphically Artsakh 's current separation from Armenia proper , and its hopes for union with the motherland . The design also recalls that of the world famous ( and very expensive ) Armenia rugs .

On an administrative map of Armenia published in 2003 in Armenia , and shown by the French magazine Geo ( August 2003 ) , Artsakh is called `` Republic of Mountainous Karabagh '' . The flag shown on top of the map is , erroneously , mirrored vertically .

Coat of arms of Artsakh
Coat of arms of Artsakh / Nagorno-Karabakh - Image by Gevork Nazaryan , 8 September 2005
The coat of arms of Artsakh consists of an eagle displayed , crowned with an ornamented crown and bearing a shield on the chest .
In the chief of the shield is depicted a mountain range and under it , vertically set , the flag of Artsakh , over all there are two stone heads . The eagle stands on a bunch of different agricultural products ( among which corn and grape ) . All is surrounded with a golden circular ribbon bearing inscription in Armenian script . From around the crown and eagle 's head towards the ribbon there are sun rays emerging .
Željko Heimer , 24 May 1998
The eagle is an old Armenian symbol , present on the 1918 and 1991 coats of arms of Armenia . The crown might by an allusion to the six autonomous principalities that existed there during Iranian ruling . The stone monument is a male head and female head and represents the women and men of Artsakh . Its name is `` We are our mountains '' ( another source I have says `` We and our mountains '' ) and it is located in Stepanakert , the capital . The grapevines I believe represent the many vines of the plateau , something illustrated by the Azeri name Gharabagh , which means `` Black Vineyard '' or close to `` Black Garden '' in Turkish Karabakh . ( Nagorno or Nagorny is of Russian origin and Artsakh is Armenian ( the oldest attested ) , but I do n't know their etymology ) .The inscription in Eastern Armenian reads Lernayin Gharabaghi Artsakh Hanrapetoutioun , which means `` Artsakh Republic of Mountainous Karabakh '' .
Luc Baronian , 25 May 1998
Nagorny ( I believe this is masculine form , Nagorno would be neuter , depending on how Russian speaker interprets the grammatical gender of Karabakh ) means upper , or mountainous . The same Slavic root appears in the name Crna Gora for Montenegro - Black Mountain .

This flag could have existed , informally , until 1989 only and , probably , since February 1988 . During the existence of the Committee of Special Management of Nagorny Karabakh ( 1989-1991 ) , only the national coat of arms and flag of USSR were used in Nagorny Karabakh .

NY Hotels Upset Over More Efficient 'Home ' Competition ; Gets Politicians To Try To Outlaw Such Things
from the not-this-again dept
This week , New York state senators vote on a bill that would make it illegal for any homeowner or renter to sublet for less than a month . The new law would be a blanket ban on short-term rentals -- no matter how ethical the renter is .
We 've seen it time and time again . The internet enables people to communicate directly with each other and create more efficient solutions than some larger ( often regulated ) industry , and that industry freaks out . Remember how a bus company freaked out about an online carpooling service and had it fined for being an `` unregulated transportation company ? '' It looks like something similar , though in a different field , is happening in New York . With hotels in the Big Apple being ridiculously expensive much of the time , people have taken to Craigslist , as well as some specific services like AirBnB , Crashpadder and Roomorama , to find residents willing to rent out their rooms or apartments on a short-term basis -- for much lower prices.But , of course , that upsets the hotels , which have their high prices and do n't like the competition . So , it seems they 've convinced politicians to try to effectively outlaw the practice Of course , as we always see with these types of laws , the politicians couch them in terms of the need for regulation for things like `` protecting tax revenue '' or `` safety standards . '' But , of course , there are plenty of other ways to deal with those issues outside of outlawing the practice entirely . The reality of the situation is that the internet has made it so that people can be more efficient in things like transportation or short-term housing , and the old guard does n't like it one bit , so they come up with regulations like these to outlaw it , even though it greatly harms the public , who get more out of using such services .

A wide body of preclinical and clinical data suggests that alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( α7-nAChRs ) may represent useful targets for cognitive improvement in schizophrenia and Alzheimer׳s disease . A promising recent approach is based on the use of positive allosteric modulators ( PAMs ) of α7-nAChRs due to their several advantages over the direct agonists . Nevertheless , the behavioural effects of this class of compounds , particularly with regard to higher-order cognitive functions , have not been broadly characterised . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the procognitive efficacies of type I and type II α7-nAChRs PAMs , N- ( 4-chlorophenyl ) - [ [ ( 4-chlorophenyl ) amino ] methylene ] -3-methyl-5-isoxazoleacet-amide ( CCMI ) and N- ( 5-Chloro-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl ) -N'- ( 5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl ) urea ( PNU-120596 ) in the novel object recognition task ( NORT ) , attentional set-shifting task ( ASST ) and five-choice serial reaction time task ( 5-CSRTT ) in rats . Additionally , the effects of galantamine , an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that also allosterically modulates nAChRs , were assessed . We report that CCMI ( 0.3-3mg/kg ) , PNU-120596 ( 0.3-3mg/kg ) and galantamine ( 1-3mg/kg ) attenuated the delay-induced impairment in NORT performance and facilitated cognitive flexibility in the ASST . Methyllycaconitine ( 3mg/kg ) blocked the actions of CCMI , PNU-120596 and galantamine in the NORT and ASST , suggesting that the procognitive effects of these compounds are α7-nAChRs-dependent . However , none of the compounds tested affected the rats ' attentional performance in the 5-CSRTT . The present findings confirm and extend the observations indicating that the positive allosteric modulation of α7-nAChRs enhances recognition memory and cognitive flexibility in preclinical tasks . Therefore , the present study supports the utility of α7-nAChRs PAMs as a potential cognitive enhancing therapy .

Edwin Jacob `` Jake '' Garn ( born October 12 , 1932 ) is an American astronaut and politician , a member of the Republican Party , who served as a U.S . Senator representing Utah from 1974 to 1993 . Garn became the first sitting member of the United States Congress to fly in space when they flew aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery as a Payload Specialist during NASA mission STS-51-D ( April 12–19 , 1985 ) .
Early life [ edit ]
Born in Richfield , Utah , Garn earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business and finance from the University of Utah in 1955 , where they became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity . They also attended East High School , Clayton Middle School , and Uintah Elementary School .
Career [ edit ]
Senator Garn is a former insurance executive . They served in the United States Navy as a Martin P5M Marlin pilot . They also served as a pilot of the 151st Air Refueling Group of the Utah Air National Guard , where they flew the Boeing KC-97L and KC-135A . They retired as a Colonel in April 1979 . [ 1 ] They were promoted to Brigadier General after their space shuttle mission . [ 2 ] They have flown more than 10,000 hours in military and private civilian aircraft . [ citation needed ]
Prior to their election to the Senate , Garn served on the Salt Lake City commission for four years and was elected as the mayor in 1971 , entering office in 1972 . They were the last Republican to hold that office to date . Garn was active in the Utah League of Cities and Towns and served as its president in 1972 . In 1974 , Garn was the first vice-president of the National League of Cities , and they served as its honorary president in 1975 .
Garn was first elected to the Senate in 1974 , succeeding retiring Republican Wallace Bennett , father of later Senator Robert Bennett . Garn was re-elected to a second term in November 1980 with 74 percent of the vote , the largest victory in a statewide race in Utah history . Garn was re-elected a second time in 1986 .
Though strongly pro-life , Garn joined U.S. Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois in resigning from the board of the United States Pro-Life Political Action Committee when the executive director of the organization , Peter Gemma , issued a `` hit list '' to target certain lawmakers who supported abortion . Garn and Hyde , the author of the Hyde Amendment , which limited abortions financed by Medicaid , said that `` hit lists '' are counterproductive because they create irrevocable discord among legislators , any of whom can be subject to a `` single issue '' attack of this kind by one interest group or another . Gemma said that they were surprised by the withdrawal of Garn and Hyde from the PAC committee but continued with plans to spend $ 650,000 for the 1982 elections on behalf of anti-abortion candidates . [ 3 ]
Garn was chairperson of the Senate Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs Committee and served on three subcommittees : Housing and Urban Affairs , Financial Institutions , and International Finance and Monetary Policy . They also are a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and served as Chairman of the HUD-Independent Agencies Subcommittee . They served on four other Appropriations subcommittees : Energy and Water Resources , Defense , Military Construction , and Interior . Garn served as a member of the Republican leadership from 1979 to 1984 as Secretary of the Republican Conference .
Their Institute of Finance has been called a `` hot tub of influence peddling . `` [ 4 ]
Garn retired from the Senate in 1992 . [ 5 ]
Savings and loan [ edit ]
As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , Garn was co-author of the Garn–St . Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 , the law that partially deregulated the savings and loan industry and attempted to forestall the looming Savings and Loan crisis .
Spaceflight [ edit ]
Garn asked to fly on the Space Shuttle because they were head of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that dealt with NASA , and had extensive aviation experience . They had previously flown a B-2 Spirit prototype and driven a new Army tank . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] STS-51-D was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center , Florida . Its primary objective was to deploy two communications satellites , and to perform electrophoresis and echocardiograph operations in space in addition to a number of other experiments . As a payload specialist , Garn 's role on the mission was as a congressional observer [ 8 ] and as a subject for medical experiments on space motion sickness . [ 9 ] At the conclusion of the mission , Garn had traveled over 2.5 million miles in 108 Earth orbits , logging over 167 hours in space .
The space sickness they experienced during the journey was so severe that a scale for space sickness was jokingly based on him , where `` one Garn '' is the highest possible level of sickness . [ 10 ] Some NASA astronauts who opposed the payload specialist program , such as Mike Mullane , believed that Garn 's space sickness was evidence of the inappropriateness of flying people with little training . [ 7 ] Astronaut Charles F. Bolden , however , described Garn as `` the ideal candidate to do it , because they were a veteran Navy combat pilot who had more flight hours than anyone in the Astronaut Office '' . [ 11 ] Fellow 51-D payload specialist Charles D. Walker—who also suffered from space sickness on the flight despite having flown before—stated that
they worked out extraordinarily well , and quite frankly , I think the U.S. space program , NASA , has benefited a lot from both their experience and their firsthand relation of NASA and the program back on Capitol Hill . As a firsthand participant in the program , they brought tremendous credibility back to Capitol Hill , and that 's helped a lot . He 's always been a friend of the agency and its programs . [ 6 ]
The Jake Garn Mission Simulator and Training Facility , NASA 's prime training facility for astronauts in the Shuttle and Space Station programs , [ 12 ] is named after him .
Upon their return , they co-authored a novel entitled Night Launch . The book centers around terrorists taking control of the Space Shuttle Discovery during the first NASA–USSR space shuttle flight . It was published in 1989 .
Personal life [ edit ]
Garn married Hazel Rhae Thompson in 1957 . [ 13 ] Together , they had four children : Jacob , Susan , Ellen , and Jeffrey . [ 13 ] Hazel died in an automobile accident in 1976 . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 1977 , Garn married Kathleen Brewerton , who had a son , Brook , from a previous marriage . [ 13 ] Jake and Kathleen had two children together , Matthew and Jennifer . [ 13 ]
In February 1980 , Garn was honored by the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge , Pennsylvania , along with U.S . Ambassador Shirley Temple Black , actor James Stewart , singer John Denver , and Tom Abraham , a business person from Canadian , Texas , who worked with immigrants seeking to become U.S . citizens . [ 15 ] Jake Garn in 1986 donated a kidney to their 27-year-old daughter , Susan Garn Horne , who was experiencing progressive kidney failure as a result of diabetes . [ 16 ]
A San Diego State University political science professor has expressed annoyance at all the good wishes for Sen. John McCain after their recent brain cancer diagnosis , prompting controversy among students .
“ I find myself annoyed at the groundswell of good wishes for John McCain after their diagnosis of glioblastoma and have been thinking through why , ” Professor Jonathan Graubart recently posted on Facebook about the Arizona Republican .
Graubart went on to question why the “ elite ” often seems to be considered more important than the unknowns .
“ McCain is a war criminal and , more to the point someone who as a politician has championed horrifying actions and been lousy on state commitment to public health . So dying or not , he 's a risible public figure ( I have no idea what they are like on the personal level and do n't care ) , ” the professor wrote on Facebook on July 21 .
“ But ultimately what troubles me is the urge to send such well wishes to an utter stranger as it reinforces the notion that some lives are more important than others . There are lots of people with glioblastoma and who have died from it ( including my mother twenty years ago ) , ” Graubart added .
The professor 's post was shared widely among students , prompting controversy , ABC News San Diego reports :
“ I would never wish cancer upon my worst enemy and then to be annoyed by people just wishing you the best for having cancer , I just thought it was totally inappropriate , ” student Ben Dilbeck said . The post was read around the world . Former SDSU student Colby Tunick read it while in Prague . “ I think I was a little disturbed to be quite honest , ” Tunick said . “ You may disagree with someone politically , morally , philosophically , but you do n't wish someone harm . ”
And the College Republicans of San Diego State University put out a statement expressing “ disappointment ” in Graubart 's statement .
“ As an academic authority at SDSU , Dr. Graubart 's sickening lack of respect towards Senator McCain will not be tolerated by our organization and should not be tolerated by university administration . ”
Referencing a San Diego State associate dean who last month called the Republican Party an “ extremist terrorist organization , ” the College Republicans of SDSU said that incident coupled with this latest one represents a “ discriminatory atmosphere towards conservatives on campus . ”
Graubart did not respond Sunday to a request for comment from The College Fix .
In a statement to ABC News San Diego , a San Diego State University spokesperson said the university “ does not have a social media policy for faculty and staff . ”
“ As a public institution , we do not and can not regulate the private speech of students , faculty or staff . However , that should not imply the university 's endorsement of any particular viewpoint . ”

Capital markets regulator , the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) , is likely to take action against listed companies including some large public sector enterprises for failure to comply with norms regarding appointment of at least one woman director on board .
While the regulator did not respond to queries on the issue , people familiar with the development told HT that Sebi could look at various options including holding back directors ' voting rights or bar them from accessing the capital markets . The market regulator also has the option of levying a penalty up to a maximum of ` 25 crore .
The regulator had earlier initiated similar action against companies when they had failed to meet the minimum 25 % public shareholding norm , which required promoters to cut down on their shareholding . To bring in gender diversity , Sebi had first issued guidelines on at least one woman director in February 2014 , giving companies time till October 1 , for compliance . The deadline was later extended to March 31 , 2015 .
Of the 1,478 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange , about 310 companies have not complied so far , with a majority rushing to fill in the spots by appointing women relatives such as wives , sisters and daughters as directors on different boards .
“ A monetary penalty may not be a pragmatic solution as it indirectly affects public shareholders . The responsibility of appointing a woman director is that of the company and will have to be discharged through the company 's promoters/board of directors , ” said Yogesh Chande , associate partner at ELP Advocates and Solicitors .
According to shareholder advisory firm IIAS : “ Sebi has increased its focus on strengthening corporate governance and may take this opportunity to establish the seriousness of its intent . This time , Sebi could restrain promoters and directors of non-compliant companies from holding any new position as director in listed companies . But , expect the severity of the penalty to increase with the passage of time , which may include severe financial penalties and eventually restrictions on accessing the capital market . ”

The Supreme Court has dismissed the Congress party 's plea seeking its intervention in the counting of votes for Gujarat Assembly election . Congress , raising doubts over the veracity of EVMs , had asked for an apex court order directing the Election Commission to tally at least 25 percent of the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails ( VVPAT ) with the EVM votes .
The court , however , refusing to intervene , told the party that it can file a `` proper plea '' seeking reforms in the polling process . Congress leaders and senior lawyers Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing the case for their party in the top court .
The top court had dismissed a similar plea earlier in November too .
A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra refused pass any order on a writ petition challenging the discretionary power of a returning officer , who is entitled to refuse counting of the paper trail from VVPAT machines . The apex court said no `` advance ruling '' can be given in the matter and in case of any dispute over the result of the poll , the challenge can be made by way of a poll petition .
The Gujarat Congress plea had come after it raised concerns over allegations of EVM tampering but the Election Commission had rejected the charges . According to several reports , there were complaints of Bluetooth devices being connected to EVMs . Senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia had complained that three EVMs were seen connected to Bluetooth devices and they sent the complaint to the ECI along with screenshots backing their complaint .
The party had earlier too demanded that the counting process in the Gujarat Assembly election should be overseen by a retired Supreme Court judge . Latching on to the reports of EVMs malfunctioning in the Uttar Pradesh civic polls , the party had said that only an independent review of EVMs can ensure fair conduct of elections in Gujarat , adding that the use of VVPAT would not be enough to ensure free and fair poll if the EVMs were `` rigged '' .
Responding to the allegations , the Election Commission had said that an inquiry found that the apprehension about possible EVM tampering through Bluetooth technology , raised by Congress , was baseless .
The device which the complainant 's mobile phone detected after putting on Bluetooth was not an Electronic Voting Machine ( EVM ) but a mobile phone , carried by a polling agent , the commission said .
`` A polling agent named Manoj Singrakhiya was carrying the mobile phone . They were in the close vicinity of the phone of the complainant ... The complainant might have thought that 'EC ' in ECO stands for Election Commission , '' Chief Electoral Officer ( CEO ) BB Swain said .
A senior poll panel official also told PTI that the attachment of a second line of verification through VVPATs to the EVM has `` left no rooms for doubts '' since voters can physically verify who they vote for .
`` With the introduction of VVPAT , nothing is left to doubt because the printed paper slip is like a ballot paper slip , '' Kumar said .
The BJP also maintained that the allegations by Congress showed they were in `` search for an excuse '' as it knew that it would bite the dust in the election .
Meanwhile , the talks about EVM tampering also had several voters , especially from the Muslim community . According to PTI , EVM — described as the `` devil '' by one worried voter — was the hot topic of discussion among the people .
With the circulation of messages on social media sites about EVMs being tampered with , many in the border district of Chhota Udaipur feared their votes might be transferred to other candidates .
“ Our vote is the only power we have and if somebody changes it , what are we left with in a democracy ? ” asked 57-year-old Sayed Mala , a small-time construction contractor .
Educated sections of the people , with access to social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook , were more worried about EVMs than the others . `` I know who I will vote for . But I am not assured if it will be counted in their favour . But with a ballot paper , my vote ca n't be changed , ” said Kalol college student Sultan Hussain .
Another constituent said they were not convinced about the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail ( VVPAT ) , a process to verify that the vote cast had gone to the candidate concerned . Farooq Sayeed from Timla village in Chhota Udaipur compared EVMs with the “ devil ” . `` There are so many videos of EVMs being tampered with on social media . My vote can be changed , '' they said .
The worries about the machines were not largely shared by Hindu voters . Narendra Sinh Bari , a 38-year-old man who runs a mobile shop , said any method could trigger doubts . `` We should trust the machines , '' they said .

PRESS RELEASE Paulson to Candidates :
Say Nothing , While I Stampede Congress Sept. 21 ( EIRNS ) U.S . Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told Presidential candidates Obama and McCain to hold off presenting their own plans for the financial meltdown , while they briefed Congress that they must enact their own plan immediately . On CNN 's Late Edition today , a Huffington Post correspondent reported that Paulson had asked both Presidential candidates to hold back and propose nothing , while Paulson presented their own plan to Congress . Obama , who was meeting with former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin on Thursday and about to present something , dutifully obeyed Paulson , the correspondent said , while McCain , being the loose cannon that they are , began instead to talk about their own plan for an MFIa Mortgage Finance Institution . American economist Lyndon LaRouche has called Paulson 's hyperinflationary bailout a treasonous swindle .
An extremely generous left-field offer has created some uncertainty around the immediate future of Travis Cloke , with the Collingwood spearhead currently weighing up a $ 27,000 a year contract from Eastern Football League battlers Nunawading FC .
Cloke has received mild-to-no interest from Victorian clubs since being dropped to the VFL , but does remain hopeful of returning to Collingwood 's senior list should 20 or more players fall terminally ill .
“ The offer literally came out of nowhere , but they have promised me regular game time in the seniors and said they wo n't have a goal-kicking coach on my back all the time , so it is a tantalising option , ” said Cloke .
Part of the attraction for the big forward is Nunawading misaligned goalposts , a result of the devastating Melbourne earthquake in 2012 . With an extra two feet of goal-face to aim at , Cloke anticipates scoring multiple majors in the 2017 season should they end up making the move .

23-year-old Raisman would n't get into the specifics of the alleged abuse -- they would only say she 's very `` angry '' and looking for justice .
Nassar has been accused of sexually abusing scores of female athletes over the years -- including McKayla Maroney .
Most of the women claim Nassar violated their genitals -- and claimed they were performing routine medical procedures .
Got your head around the legal issues surrounding social media ? So , now , what 're your thoughts on crypto-currency ? If you have n't heard by now ; it is definitely a real thing , one which is cementing a place in the world 's financial environment . In fact , in a speech on 5 July 2014 Geoff Bascand , deputy governor and head of operations at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said while `` crypto-currencies are unlikely to replace cash in the foreseeable future , technological change is relentless and there is nothing innate about cash-money that says it must continue forever . '' Law Society journalist Rachael Breckon asked Chapman Tripp partner Ross Pennington to share their thoughts on what digital currency Bitcoin could mean for lawyers and financial markets . “ Do we envisage Bitcoin being a common paying practice ? No . But , is it a part of the financial architecture we are bound to understand ? Definitely , ” the capital markets , banking and structured finance lawyer says . Although few clients seek advice on Bitcoin Mr Pennington says it is something their team is interested in , with junior team member Anouk Rondel , who did their honours thesis on Bitcoin , leading training in the area .
Mr Pennington admits it took a while to get their head around Bitcoin and understanding the roles of cryptography , the proof of work , the block chain , and mining . However , they say “ once you understand how those things work together it allows you to address the criticism , a la ‘ Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme . Bitcoin is a bubble . Bitcoin is extremely vulnerable to hacking . Bitcoin is a way of avoiding the tax man , or getting people shot without consequence . ' ”
They say in many ways Bitcoin is not much different to money , which has gone through its own evolution on the road to becoming its modern form of ‘ fiat currency ' issued by central banks and has many more components to it than merely coins and notes in circulation . Bitcoin is still in an evolutionary phase but it is used in pockets of commerce and there are people who famously use or endorse it and there are a number who famously do n't , Mr Pennington says .
Apple , for example , is doing little to facilitate it . But , on the other side , amongst Bitcoins cheerleaders are high profile people such as Eric Schmidt , Bill Gates , Richard Branson , and Al Gore . Regulation
Internationally , the regulatory focus for Bitcoin is primarily in the areas of anti-money laundering , tax , controls on payment systems and financial product markets , the scope for fraud given the unregulated nature of Bitcoin , and its use in connection with criminal enterprise ( for example , Silk Road ) . Because Bitcoin itself is a decentralised online ledger , the regulatory targets are the Bitcoin exchanges which facilitate transactions and their individual promoters . For the team at Chapman Tripp the interest in Bitcoin is primarily due to how it relates to licensing of payment systems , exchanges and financial product markets , which is overseen by the Reserve Bank and Financial Markets Authority ( FMA ) . Currently , Bitcoin is not being regulated in New Zealand , besides the country 's Reserve Bank and the Australian Reserve Bank simultaneously telling citizens that Bitcoin is “ interesting but risky ” .
Mr Pennington describes this warning as “ quaint ” , but reasonable given that the focus is on payment or settlement systems that are systemically important in the sense that their failure could cause wider disruptions to the financial system . “ Neither of them are purporting to designate any Bitcoin exchange as a payment system pursuant to Part 5C of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act or the Australian counterpart , nor are there any suggestions at this stage that it would be regulated as a securities market under the current Securities Market Act or as a derivative market under that Act , nor have I heard any suggestion that it is going to be registered as a financial markets product , ” they say . Similarly , the FMA has been silent on the subject of Bitcoin , despite the fact that – at this point in its evolution – its primary function is as an investment rather than as a means of payment . In a paper by Noel Yahanpath , Senior Lecturer Business School Eastern Institute of Technology Napier , New Zealand Growth Of Bitcoin Market In New Zealand : Red Flag Or Fraud ? Mr Yahanpath suggests that as a result of threats of software errors , fraud or theft , and exposure to price volatility , Bitcoin as an investment can be classified as very risky , and the FMA should do more . Ms Rondel , who has personally invested in Bitcoin , says “ I do think that Bitcoin start-ups that are trying to get into different areas , certainly exchanges , are conscious that Bitcoin could be considered a financial product and something that the regulators are interested in. ” BitNZ , which is the main Bitcoin exchange , has some basic “ know your client ” protections , requiring users to have a photo ID and a proof of address , which is basically taking a photo of yourself next to your ID and sending a scanned proof of your address . For Mr Pennington the current position of Bitcoin in the market reminds them of carbon credits “ back in the day ” . Despite the breadth of the various definitions of security , it was difficult to see that emissions units came within any of the traditional categories – something which was eventually clarified by specific amendments to the Securities Act . “ It seems to be that Bitcoins are probably not really either . [ Bitcoin ] is ultimately an algorithm , or an online ledger at its most basic . Is it a financial product ? It is not any that I am familiar with , ” Mr Pennington says . They add that , because of its use an investment , it could be within the much broader definition of “ security ” in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 , enabling the FMA to exercise its discretion to declare Bitcoin to be a financial product under section 562 of that Act .
Mushrooms grow at rapid rates , quickly bursting up out of the ground and reaching full size in as little as one night . Unless you sit and watch a mushroom for many hours it 's hard to see just how quickly this fungus can grow . These time-lapse GIFs are perfect at putting the amazingness of it all into perspective .
Mushrooms are made up of around 92 % water , and die away just as suddenly as they appear . The mushroom we see is only part of the entire being . The actual mushroom cap is the short-lived fruit of a much more hardy organism .
Beneath the soil sits the mycelium , or the root of the mushroom , which can live for years , hence why you will see mushrooms popping up repeatedly in the same places . Check out these hypnotic time-lapse GIFs to see how incredible it is to watch mushrooms grow .

A mycelium can fit inside a tiny ant infected with parasitic fungi , or a mycelium can grow to stretch over a mile in length . Regardless of its size , you will never know a mycelium is there until it sprouts a mushroom puffball above the soil surface .
More than 80 % of all earthly plants have a mycorrhizal relationship with fungus . The underground mycelium nourishes nearby plant roots and in return the plant lends valuable nutrients to the mycelium .

The reason mushrooms are able to appear literally over night is because they store up an abundance of nutrients between each fruiting , many mycelium fruit as little as once a year . Yet there is more to the rapid development of mushrooms than this .
Plants and animals grow via cell division , a slow process that requires a lot of time and energy . A mushroom also grows by cell division , but not in the same way . Right when a mushroom first appears it has about the same exact number of cells as it will have at peak maturity .
Mushrooms grow through cell enlargement , a process that allows the cells to rapidly balloon in size all at once . Since the cells fill with water it takes very little time , hence how a mushroom can go from a tiny dot to a full grown mushroom in one night .

Many fungi produce a cell wall made of chitin , the same material that coats the outer shell of insects . This sets fungi even further apart from plants , which can not produce chitin .
Mushrooms can produce vitamin D with sunlight exposure , just like your skin . Interestingly , if you leave a mushroom in the sun for eight hours it generates 4,600 times the vitamin D ! Mushrooms also have a built-in immune system , and are more similar to humans than plants in regard to DNA .

There are over 1.8 million different species of fungi , and some 80,000 have yet to be identified . This particular GIF shows a Veiled Lady Mushroom , a unique mushroom that looks like it is formed from lace .
Photo Credit : BBCWorldwide
The lace catches your eye , but the magic behind this mushroom is in its less ostentatious cap . The greenish-brown cap on the top of the mushroom is filled with spores and slime . The slime attracts flies , which then disperse the spores wherever they fly next .
The Veiled Lady Mushroom is found in Asia , America , Australia , and Africa . It is a delicious and edible mushroom , and is a healthy addition to many Chinese dishes .

A majority of GOP voters said the allegations of past sexual harassment against Herman Cain does not influence their likelihood of supporting Cain as the Republican nominee , according to a new poll conducted during the controversy .
Sixty-nine percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents surveyed said the controversy did not have any impact on their support of Cain , according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll . Fifty-five percent said they do n't consider the allegations currently swirling around Cain 's campaign to be a `` serious matter . ''

Cain retains their front-runner status in the poll with 23 percent support nationally , neck and neck with rival Mitt Romney , who has 24 percent . Rick Perry is in third place with 13 percent , and Newt Gingrich has surged to 12 percent .
Among the nearly four in 10 Republican and Republican-leaning voters who do consider the allegations to be serious , 52 percent said it makes them less likely to vote for Cain . The poll showed that a higher number of respondents considered the allegations `` serious '' later in the week , as the controversy continued to grow .
Results suggest that if Cain 's campaign can not get ahead of the scandal , the controversy could significantly dent their support . Cain has denied any wrongdoing in response to the controversy , and blamed various sources for planting the story . The scandal involves claims from up to three women in the 1990s who accused Cain , then head of the National Restaurant Association , of sexual harassment .
The poll was conducted by Langer Research Associates starting Oct. 31 through Nov. 3 . The charges against Cain first resurfaced on Oct. 30 . The margin of error is 3 percent .
AUSTIN — Lt. Gov . David Dewhurst 's re-election campaign reported Monday that it has outstanding loans totaling more than $ 5.3 million , indicating that the incumbent lieutenant governor ponied up around $ 3 million out of pocket since the final week of February to try and beat Dan Patrick .
That comes on top of $ 2 million that Dewhurst lent their campaign earlier in the cycle .
Candidates in the May 27 runoff are facing a midnight deadline to file campaign finance reports with the Texas Ethics Commission . The full filings wo n't be publicly available online until Tuesday morning — and that 's when we 'll know details about who contributed and exactly how much Dewhurst loaned their campaign .
But the Dewhurst 's campaign released a cover sheet late Monday , detailing top-line figures that show how much was raised , spent and the principal amount of all outstanding loans .
According to the report , Dewhurst raised about $ 1.65 million and spent almost $ 5 million in the period between February 23 and May 17 , which includes the final two weeks of the primary cycle ( the primary was on March 4 ) .
Dewhurst had already loaned their campaign $ 2 million in late December ( the campaign had been carrying outstanding loans of more than $ 387,000 since 2012 ) . The new filing shows that the campaign reported an additional $ 3 million in outstanding loans incurred during the most recent fundraising period .
Earlier Monday , Patrick , a Houston state Senator , reported raising more than $ 4 million in the latest fundraising period . Their campaign released a top-line fundraising figure but did not make public a cover sheet or the full report .
Official White House position : Women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment are lying
CLOSE The White House says their official position on the women accusing Donald Trump of sexual harassment or rape is that they are 'lying . ' Buzz60
All of the women who have accused President Trump of sexually harassing them are lying , Trump spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday .
Sanders was asked point blank about the White House 's stance on these accusations .
“ Obviously , sexual harassment has been in the news , ” CBS News ' Jacqueline Alemany asked . `` At least 16 women accused the president of sexually harassing them throughout the course of the campaign . Last week , during a press conference in the Rose Garden , the president called these accusations 'fake news . ' Is the official White House position that all of these women are lying ? ''
“ Yeah , we 've been clear on that from the beginning , and the president 's spoken on it , ” Sanders replied .
Sanders ' comment comes as more women have come forward about being sexually harassed and sexually assaulted by high-profile men , such as Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein and journalist Mark Halperin .
Last week , the president was asked about accusations by former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos . Zervos accused Trump of repeated `` unwanted sexual touching , '' alleging that they were `` ambushed '' by Trump , and that they kissed her , touched their breast and pressed their body against them without consent . They filed a sexual misconduct lawsuit against him .
The president said of Zervos ' allegations , `` All I can say is it 's totally fake news . It 's just fake . It 's fake . It 's made-up stuff , and it 's disgraceful , what happens , but ... that happens in the world of politics . ''

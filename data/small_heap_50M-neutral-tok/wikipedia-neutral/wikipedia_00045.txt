IND $ FILE is a file transfer program from IBM that was first released in 1983 to allow the transfer of files between an IBM PC running the IBM 3270 emulator ( PC/3270 ) and a VSE , MVS or VM/CMS mainframe . IND $ FILE originally worked only with the SEND and RECEIVE commands of the 3270 PC emulator , but today most terminal emulators that have a 3270 mode include it .
In the UK , it is also known as IND£FILE , since in the EBCDIC code pages used in the UK the pound sign occupies the position the dollar sign takes in US codepages .

`` Knock , Knock Who 's There ? '' is a song written and composed by John Carter and Geoff Stephens , released on Apple Records . It was originally sung and recorded by the Welsh singer Mary Hopkin and was the 's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1970 , where it came second . The single version was produced by Mickie Most and reached No . 2 on the UK charts .
Overview
On 7 March 1970 , Mary Hopkin sang six songs at the UK National Final , A Song for Europe , which was aired on the television series It 's Cliff Richard ! . Hopkin was chosen by the BBC to be the United Kingdom 's representative for that year , and the winner of a postal vote would determine which of the six songs would progress with them to the finals in Amsterdam . `` Knock , Knock Who 's There ? `` , the sixth and final song performed that evening , won the postal vote with over 120,000 supporters .
At Amsterdam , the song was performed seventh on the night , after 's Guy Bonnet with `` Marie-Blanche '' , and before 's David Alexandre Winter with `` Je suis tombé du ciel '' . At the end of judging that evening , `` Knock , Knock Who 's There ? '' took the second-place slot with 26 points after 's `` All Kinds of Everything '' , performed by Dana . The UK received points from nine out of a possible eleven voting juries .
The singer expresses a long-held optimism at the prospect of love finally finding them At the exact point that said optimism has faded , and they have resigned themselves to not finding love and companionship , they hear a `` knock , knock '' , which signifies love finally becoming attainable for them Excited , they beckon love to `` come inside '' and into their life .
The single was released in March 1970 , backed by `` I 'm Going to Fall in Love Again '' ( the runner-up in the Song for Europe final ) on the B-side . On 28 March 1970 , `` Knock , Knock Who 's There ? '' entered the UK Singles Chart at No . 7 , the highest new entry of the week . It peaked at No . 2 and remained on the chart for 14 weeks . It was n't released in the United States as a single until November 1972 , where it floundered for four weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 , only reaching a peak of No.92 . In the Netherlands it peaked at No . 3 on the Dutch Top 40 as well as on the Single Top 100 .
Rather different from their usual material , Hopkin rarely performed the song after the Eurovision due to their distaste for it . They later commented : `` I was so embarrassed about it . Standing on stage singing a song you hate is awful . '' They also referred to it as humiliating . At the time , they conceded victory gracefully saying that `` the best song won '' and wished Dana well .
In 1970 , a sound-alike cover appeared on the album Top of the Pops , Volume 10 .

The Bayan Lepas LRT line is a proposed light rapid transit ( LRT ) line in the Malaysian state of Penang . Conceived by the Penang state government in the 2000s as part of the Penang Transport Master Plan ( PTMP ) , the proposed line within the city of George Town was envisioned to link the city centre with the industrial town of Bayan Lepas to the south .
Nineteen stations are expected to be built along the stretch . Eight additional stations will also be built on three islets that will be reclaimed off the southern coastline of Penang Island , bringing the overall length of the planned route to .
In 2015 , the construction of the LRT line was announced to begin in 2018 . That did not happen . Construction was then expected to start in 2020 , and that did not happen again . No construction has begun as of 2022 . Significant delays in actually constructing the line has been attributed to political feuds for funding between the Penang state government and the federal government of Malaysia .
Overview
The Bayan Lepas LRT line forms the backbone of the Penang Transportation Master Plan , a comprehensive proposal formulated by the Penang state government to improve transportation within the State of Penang . Among the components of the plan , the LRT line is being prioritised by the state authorities for implementation , as the line will serve a densely populated urban and industrial corridor along the eastern coast of Penang Island , specifically between George Town proper and Bayan Lepas to the south . In addition , the LRT service would facilitate easier commute for tourists arriving via the Penang International Airport in Bayan Lepas .
History
SRS Consortium , a joint venture consisting of Gamuda Berhad , Ideal Property Development Sdn Bhd and Loh Phoy Yen Holdings , was appointed as the Project Delivery Partner ( PDP ) in 2015 . Within the same year , the first public consultation session on the alignment of the proposed route was held . Following the sessions , the route was finalised and 27 stations identified ; the eight southernmost stations will be built on three islets which will be reclaimed to the south of Penang Island . Much of the line will be elevated to reduce land acquisition and to preclude the relocation of underground utilities .
As public transportation falls under the purview of the Malaysian federal government , the proposal was submitted to the Federal Land Public Transport Commission ( SPAD ) by April 2016 for approval by the federal authorities . However , a political feud between the Pakatan Harapan-led Penang state government and the federal government at the time , which was dominated by Barisan Nasional , led to delays in securing the required federal approval .
On 20 June 2020 , chairperson of the State Works Committee Zairil Khir Johari said that the LRT would continue , with or without the Federal government as it was funded through the land reclamation .

Dead Congregation is a Greek death metal band from Athens formed in 2004 . The band have released two full-length albums , two EPs , and a split release with Hatespawn . They released their latest full-length album Promulgation of the Fall on May 5 , 2014 through their own label , Martyrdoom Productions , and on November 7 , 2016 , they released their EP 'Sombre Doom ' . The band 's name is derived from the title of a song written in their previous band Nuclear Winter .
History
The band was founded by lead guitarist and vocalist Anastasis Valtsanis after the split-up of Nuclear Winter . Nuclear Winter started off as a crust punk band . Later , they began incorporating some influences from the early Swedish death metal scene . Their debut release was a self-financed EP , which already presents a blending of those styles . After a long hiatus , the band released in 2000 a split with Incriminated from Finland . Before the break-up of Nuclear Winter , Valtsanis recorded one last demo with the band . After one of bandmates quit the group , Valtsanis recorded the Abomination Virginborn demo as band 's chief songwriter .
Valtsanis said in an interview that `` it was clear that we needed to form a new band , as Nuclear Winter was never my brainchild , and thus I needed to distance myself from anything with which I could n't relate to 100 % musically , aesthetically or ideologically . We 'd been friends with T.K . already , we knew they were a competent guitarist , and after all three of us rehearsed together for the first time , it was more than obvious that the line-up was complete . Soon after the first songs were ready , we were so confident in our material that we did n't even record a demo , instead we went in the studio and recorded 5 songs that became our debut EP , Purifying Consecrated Ground . '' The EP was released on May 1 , 2005 through Konqueror Records to positive reviews . AllMusic 's Cosmo Lee described it as `` a formidable opening salvo in their war against modernity . '' Blabbermouth gave the EP 7/10 and praised the songwriting , writing that `` stands apart from the failures of disingenuous imitators by putting work into the song structures . Varying tempos that run from the plodding and doomy to fast and vicious ( with moments that approach raw black metal ) , there is plenty of meat on the bone here . ''
They released their debut full-length album Graves of the Archangels on January 30 , 2008 in collaboration with Nuclear War Now ! Productions . The album received overwhelming critical praise and has gained a huge underground following since its release . Blabbermouth praised the album as a step up from their EP , writing that `` It is one of those albums that is demonstrative of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts . '' Particular praise was directed towards the songwriting , atmosphere , and the interplay between the guitarists . Sputnik Music 's Tyler Munro gave the album 4.5/5 , writing that `` pulls absolutely no punches . As said , it 's an absolutely massive sounding album . Lose your focus and the album quite literally turns to background noise . The guitars continually overlap into an ocean of riffs . They splash around and when one guitar is n't doing something the other is . Everything layers unto itself and make no mistakes that the intention hear is to deafen the listener in the most traditional of fashions . '' They concluded by arguing that `` Graves of the Archangels is not only one of the best metal releases of the year , but quite possibly one of the best in recent memory . '' On April 1 , they released a split EP with Hatespawn . It was named by Pitchfork 's Brandon Stosuy as the 5th best metal album of 2008 . They later wrote that `` It was my favorite death metal album of the year and it 's only gotten better since '' .
Following a period of inactivity , in April 2014 the band announced the title and artwork of their second-full-length album Promulgation of the Fall . The album was released on May 16 , 2014 in collaboration with Profound Lore Records and Norma Envagelium Diaboli . Promulgation of the Fall received overwhelmingly positive critical acclaim from Pitchfork , Sputnik Music , Exclaim ! , Metal Injection , and was featured on a number of end-of-year lists . Exclaim ! wrote that `` while Promulgation of the Fall ca n't take advantage of the element of surprise , burdened with the weight of expectation , the record is no less brilliant , displaying exquisite technical refinement . As glorious as the riffs are , the drumming steals the show here , elemental and mind-altering in its simultaneous precision and ravenousness . The transitions on the album in particular are something to behold , such as the way that the title track opens like a wound and gives way to the massive , crawling `` Serpentskin , '' or the way the ecstatic violence of `` Nigredo '' shudders , hunches and splits into `` Schisma . '' Located firmly in the liminal space between the abject and the sublime , the fascinatingly repulsive and the awfully beautiful , Promulgation of the Fall is a rare death metal accomplishment . ''
On September 30 , 2016 the band announced that they would release a new EP titled 'Sombre Doom ' on November 7th in collaboration with Norma Envagelium Diaboli , and on October 25 began streaming the EP .
Musical style
Dead Congregation play a style of death metal with significant emphasis on atmosphere rather than speed or technicality , and has been described as `` uncompromisingly brutal in a subsuming , freeing way . '' Comparisons have been frequently made to death metal bands such as Incantation , Immolation , and Morbid Angel , and are often described as `` old-school '' death metal , in reference to their influence from older death metal styles . The band have stressed the importance of `` feeling and atmosphere above all . '' Valtsanis said that `` The same riff can sound completely different if you alter important factors such us sound , drumming , the way you hit the chords on the guitar and many more . But in the end it 's all about the atmosphere a recording creates , if it does n't ooze of death and morbidity then it should n't be labeled as Death Metal simply because the vocals are distorted and the drums are fast . '' They went on to describe their sound as `` just darkened Death Metal the way we perceive it as true . ''

InVisage Technologies is a fabless semiconductor company known for producing a technology called QuantumFilm , an image sensor technology that improves the quality of digital photographs taken with a cell phone camera . The company is based in Menlo Park , CA .
History
InVisage Technologies was founded by the company 's current CTO Ted Sargent , a professor from the University of Toronto . While developing transmitters and receivers in their lab at U of T , they discovered an especially sensitive receiver , which formed the basis of InVisage 's QuantumFilm technology . Sargent then secured the rights to the technology and founded InVisage in October 2006 . The company applied this technology toward mobile phone cameras . In 2007 , Jess Lee , a former vice president from OmniVision Technologies , joined InVisage as the company 's CEO . Syrus Madavi serves as the company 's chairperson of the board of directors , having joined InVisage in 2012 .
In February 2013 , it was announced that the company had received $ 20 million in a Series D funding round led by GGV Capital that included Nokia Growth Partners as a new investor , with the company expecting to begin shipping devices with their sensors in the second quarter of 2014 .
On November 9 , 2017 , it was reported that Apple , Inc. acquired InVisage Technologies .
QuantumFilm Technology
QuantumFilm Technology involves the creation of a film to coat the image sensors used in a cellphone camera , allowing it to capture more light , improving the quality of the images taken . A typical camera phone pixel sensor is made up of several layers , with a layer of colored plastic or glass acting as a color filter sitting on top of several layers of metal connecting silicon electronic transistors together , which is itself on top of a base layer of silicon used by the sensor 's electronic transistors and photodetectors . The light coming to the sensor has to pass through the layers of metal before reaching the silicon , a weak light absorber , so the sensor detects only about 25 percent of the light that makes up the image . QuantumFilm places a layer of semiconducting crystals - called quantum dots - on top of the chip , which allows the chip to absorb more light , place more pixels in a smaller space , and create sharper images .
Using quantum dots is more efficient at capturing light than traditional silicon-based image sensor chips ( capturing 90-95 % of the light that hits it ) , giving the sensors higher sensitivity in low light as well as higher resolution . And while traditional image sensors read an image from top to bottom ( which can create a blurred image when the subject is moving ) , quantum dots detect the entire image at the same moment , reducing the chance for distortion .
Invisage holds patents related to the development of QuantumFilm technology , as well as its applications toward optoelectronic devices .
Awards
In 2010 , InVisage 's QuantumFilm technology was awarded The Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Award . In 2011 , the company received a gold award from the International Imaging Industry Association 's ( I3A ) VISION 2020 Imaging Innovation for its QuantumFilm technology .

The Social Democratic Workers ' Party of Germany ( , SDAP ) was a Marxist socialist political party in the North German Confederation during unification .
Founded in Eisenach in 1869 , the SDAP endured through the early years of the German Empire . Often termed the Eisenachers , the SDAP was one of the first political organizations established among the nascent German labor unions of the 19th century . It officially existed under the name SDAP for only six years ( 1869–1875 ) . However , through name changes and political partnerships , its lineage can be traced to the present-day Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) .
Origins
VDAV and ADAV
The SDAP was one of the earliest organizations to arise from German workers ' unionizing activity , but it was not the first . At the group 's founding in 1869 , the fast-growing working class of the Industrial Revolution had already established several notable associations for workers ' advocacy . Chief among these were Leopold Sonnemann 's Assembly of German Worker Associations ( Verband Deutscher Arbeitervereine , VDAV ) and Ferdinand Lassalle 's General German Workers ' Association ( Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein , ADAV ) .
The largest group by far was the VDAV . Through the 1860s , it remained mostly apolitical , dedicated to pocketbook matters and fully integrated with the paradigms of liberal economic interests . The VDAV did its best to ignore the political agitation of Lassalle 's much smaller yet more active ADAV . The Lassalleans were seen as insufficiently committed to basic economic matters . Much of their political appeal was based on what socialists considered to be an alarming militancy in support of German nationalism and the question of Greater Germany . They displayed a discomfiting closeness to the militaristic Kingdom of Prussia . Eventually , the sundry turmoil created by the German unification wars helped politicize large elements of the previously unmoved VDAV . Some followed Sonnemann to the new moderately socialist German People 's Party ( founded in 1868 ) , while others were ready to abandon the VDAV structure altogether and establish a more radical political party .
Eisenachers
Meeting in the city of Eisenach in Saxony , the VDAV activists founded the Social Democratic Workers ' Party ( SDAP ) on 7–9 August 1869 . The Eisenachers , as they came to be called , were under the leadership of Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel .
The political theorist Karl Marx had a significant personal influence upon the newly formed party , being a friend and mentor to both Bebel and Liebknecht . Marx and Friedrich Engels steered the party toward more Marxian socialism and welcomed them ( as far as German law would allow ) into their International Workingmen 's Association ( IWA ) .
Platform and organization
The SDAP was typically deemed Marxist by most observers , although this term was somewhat amorphous during Marx 's lifetime . The party was described as such mainly because of its IWA membership and Liebknecht 's close personal relationship with Marx .
The true nature of Eisenacher Marxism was closer to democratic socialism than the communist parties of later decades . The party platform called for a free people 's state ( freier Volkstaat ) , which could align private cooperatives with state organizations . The party primarily supported trade unionism as the utility by which workers could prosper in the context of capitalism .
Der Volksstaat
The party press was a vital element of the SDAP 's political strategy . The party 's newspaper was first called Demokratisches Wochenblatt ( Democratic Weekly Paper ) and later Der Volksstaat ( The People 's State ) and was edited by Liebknecht . The paper was published in Leipzig from 2 October 1869 to 23 September 1876 . The party did not yet have its own printers , but Liebknecht was ambitious in their efforts to promote its publications on a wide scale as educational tools for workers . Although most issues of Der Volksstaat were primarily composed of incendiary writing about the German political situation , Liebknecht attempted as much as possible to include essays on political theory , transcripts of academic lectures , and even some popular fiction .
Congress at Gotha
Despite their differences , the SDAP and Lassalle 's ADAV shared a largely identical interpretation of socialism . The similarity was significant enough to mean that they were both routinely monitored and considered equally suspicious by the authorities . The two parties were vying for the same audience among the working class , and they were doing so simultaneously with several more moderate liberal organizations . The critical distinction among all the groups ' positions was their level of commitment to the right to strike .
SAPD and SPD
The competition between moderate and radical factions reached a boiling point when SDAP and Lassalle 's ADAV finally merged to form a united front . In a convention at Gotha in 1875 , the new fusion party was renamed the Socialist Workers ' Party of Germany ( German : Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands , SAPD ) . The resultant Gotha Program was a mixture of socialist and liberal capitalist ideas . Though it largely satisfied the conventioneers , the new policies were denounced by Marx themselves in the scathing essay Critique of the Gotha Program ( 1875 ) .
Despite its relatively moderate stance , the SAPD organization was deemed subversive and officially banned by the German Empire under the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878 . Under proscription , the party 's members continued to organize successfully . After the ban was lifted in 1890 , they rechristened themselves as the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands , SPD ) and surged at the polls . By the 1912 elections , the SPD ( a direct descendant of the small SDAP ) had become the largest party in Germany .
Legacy
Though the SDAP dissolved after a brief lifespan of just six years , it was an essential catalyst in creating the first significant labor party in Germany . After World War II , members of the SPD in East Germany were compelled to join forces with the Communist Party to form the Socialist Unity Party . Throughout its 41-year rule , the party paid regular tribute to its Marxist progenitor . In West Germany , the SPD became one of the two major parties and continues to wield vast influence in the post-reunification era . It still traces its lineage back to the SDAP at Gotha and Eisenach .

Holoplankton are organisms that are planktic ( they live in the water column and can not swim against a current ) for their entire life cycle . Holoplankton can be contrasted with meroplankton , which are planktic organisms that spend part of their life cycle in the benthic zone . Examples of holoplankton include some diatoms , radiolarians , some dinoflagellates , foraminifera , amphipods , krill , copepods , and salps , as well as some gastropod mollusk species . Holoplankton dwell in the pelagic zone as opposed to the benthic zone . Holoplankton includes both phytoplankton and zooplankton and vary in size . The most common plankton are protists .
Reproduction
Holoplankton has unique traits that make reproduction in the water column possible . Both sexual and asexual reproduction are used depending on the type of plankton . Some invertebrate holoplankton release sperm into the water column which are then taken up by the females for fertilization . Other species release both sperm and egg to increase the likelihood of fertilization . Environmental , mechanical , or chemical cues can all trigger this release .
Diatoms are single celled phytoplankton that can occur as individuals or as long chains . They can reproduce sexually and asexually .
Diatoms are important oxygen producers and are usually the first step in the food chain .
Copepods are small holoplanktonic crustaceans that swim using their hind legs and antennae .
Defenses
Because of their small size and sluggish swimming abilities , holoplanktonic species have made certain specialized adaptations and in some cases are equipped with special defenses . Adaptations include flat bodies , lateral spines , oil droplets , floats filled with gases , sheaths made of gel-like substances , and ion replacement .
Zooplankton have adapted by developing transparent bodies , bright colors , bad tastes and cyclomorphosis ( seasonal changes in body shape ) . When predators release a chemical in the water to signal zooplankton ; cyclomorphosis allows holoplankton to increase their spines and protective shields . Studies have shown that although small in size certain gelatinous zooplankton are rich in protein and lipid . `` Many holoplanktons seem to have very little visible defense mechanisms ; therefore , it is hypothesized that a chemical defense may be possible . Pelagic cnidarians ( jellyfish and related species ) have nematocysts on their tentacles that eject a coiled microscopic thread very rapidly . These threads penetrate the surface of their target and release a series of complicated , biologically advanced venoms . Their stings can be very dangerous , due in part to the number of vital systems affected .

Goemon enjoyed average abilities ; Ebisumaru could throw farther but suffered athletically , while Sasuke could jump high but could not throw as well as the others . Players control one character at a time to move through each stage and defeat enemies , who attack with close-range and projectile weapons . If a player 's character is hit by an enemy , their hit points are decreased ; if all are exhausted , the character loses a life and the stage is restarted from the beginning . Hit points can be replenished via hearts scattered throughout the game . At maximum hit points , characters are capable of long-range special attacks . At the end of each stage is a boss enemy with higher health and stronger attacks than other foes . Mystical Ninja features some puzzle elements and mini games , such as fetch quests producing items needed to cross inhospitable terrain or quizzes for bonus items . The game 's music kept with the style of other Ganbare Goemon games by employing an `` oriental sound '' . It is compatible with the Super Game Boy and contains a special decorative border for play in this fashion .
Plot
After Yae is kidnapped , Goemon , Ebisumaru , and Sasuke set out to find the Black Ship Gang and rescue them They first assault Karakuri Castle , the pirates ' hideout , where they learn that Baron Skull—the captain of the group—lured Yae to their hideout . They pursue Baron to the Demon Cave , where Goemon discovers clues left behind by the female ninja . They take them to the Black Ship Skull , the flagship of the pirates moored in Gull Harbor . Goemon and their friends destroy the ship without locating Yae , and are aghast to see a second Black Ship Gang vessel sail into harbor . They board it and continue the quest , eventually wresting Yae from Baron Skull 's hold .
Reception
Nintendo Power gave Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon a 6.7 rating on a scale of 1 to 10 . The magazine 's editors enjoyed the expansive world , but criticized the quality of certain graphical elements , noting that certain hazards and features were `` hard to distinguish '' . The play control received average marks , with Nintendo Power 's reviewers decrying the difficulty of dodging due to the high speed of enemy projectiles and movement problems with boss battles . Writers compared the game to The Legend of Zelda series in design , but criticized the automatic regeneration of enemies in each stage—a tenet which made retracing one 's steps tedious . The magazine 's reviewers noted that Mystical Ninja would provide a challenging experience despite not being as detailed as Zelda games . Nintendo Power 's spotlight on the game concluded with the remarks that players should not `` expect to get a smaller version of the N64 game '' —and that though the mini games were ' a blast ' , the main game is sort of a drag .

Chelsea Opera Group is an organisation based in London which arranges concert productions of operas and other works . It was founded in 1950 when David Cairns and Stephen Gray invited Colin Davis , who was at the time a 22-year-old clarinetist , to conduct a concert performance of Mozart 's Don Giovanni in the Holywell Music Room , Oxford .
The Group has continued this practice since , mainly with the purpose of reviving neglected operas and lesser known versions of more familiar operas . Colin Davis was the president until their death in April 2013 . The Group continues to perform operas and other works in London and in Salisbury .
Company history and performances
Since Falstaff in 1956 , a considerable number of operas by Giuseppe Verdi have appeared on the roster , including many of the lesser-known earlier works such as the 1847 version of Macbeth ( in 2008 ) ; the original French version of I Vespri Sicilianni , the 1855 Les vêpres siciliennes ( 1977 and 1999 ) ; and several others such as Aroldo ( 1993 ) ; and Jérusalem ( 1997 ) .
Musicians who have gained experience early in their careers by performing with the Group include Sir Simon Rattle , Sir Mark Elder , and Sir Roger Norrington , Dame Kiri te Kanawa , Sir Willard White , Sir John Tomlinson , Sarah Walker and Jill Gomez .
In addition to some of the standard operatic repertory over the years , a recent concert performance which has drawn attention to the Group has been Donizetti 's rarely performed Belisario ( written in 1836 ) , which starred Nelly Miricioiu under conductor Richard Bonynge and was given at Queen Elizabeth Hall on 13 February 2011 .
Members
Dame Fiona Woolf , - As well as being President of the Group , they are also a member of its choir .

Kharanaq ( , also Romanized as Kharānaq , Kharāneq , and Kharānoq ; also known as Khowrāneq , ( ( means land of sun ) ) Khurūnaq or Kharanagh ) is a village located 70 km north of Yazd in Rabatat Rural District , Kharanaq District , Ardakan County , Yazd Province , Iran . At the 2006 census , its population was 433 , in 133 families . The town and its minaret have become a minor tourist attraction .
Kharanaq , which was known as a world and historical village , was introduced as the 23rd city of Yazd province on July 6 , 2020 . This 4500-year-old city is surrounded by mountains on one side and desert from the other .
Many buildings in Kharanaq/ Kharanagh are completely collapsed and ramshackle , but among them , the remaining mosque from the Qajar period , a shaking minaret from 17th and the caravanserai of the city have been reconstructed and can be visited .
The main buildings and sites
Castle of Kharanaq
The castle is the main attraction of the village . it is reminiscent of the Sassanid era and dates back to around 1800 years . Kharanaq Castle is one of the first castles in the world with two- and three-story houses . It contains 80 houses , watchtowers and is surrounded by a tall wall .
It has exhibition rooms made of clay and mud , inside the castle was designed like a maze to create confusion for thieves and attackers , who entering the building .
The bridge of Kharanaq
Among all the villages in Yazd , Kharanaq is the only village that has a bridge . However , many myths and stories surround this bridge as it has never been a passage for animals or livestock .
It is believed that the bridge only exists to transfer water from the seasonal river to the farms , or act as a dam . The bridge is 40 meters long and it was designed to prevent water shortage in the village .
Shaking Minaret
This magnificent building is one of the three moving minarets in Iran and was designed in Seljuk period , it is a part of the nationally registered works of Iran . The minaret is designed and constructed in a special way so it can move . It is built in a way that one can shake it by giving a gentle push on its upper part . The minaret has three floors , which are interconnected through spiral stairs . For climbing or going down the stairs , there are two separate corridors . The width of the spiral staircase is 70 cm at the bottom and gradually narrows to a final width of 40 cm at the top . it is made completely out of clay , which make it to be the only minaret in the world made of this material .
Kharanaq Caravanserai
The caravanserai dates to Sasanian Dynasty . Then it was rebuilt and reconstructed under the command of Muhammad Vali Mirza , the son of Fath-Ali- Shah Qajar . The large number of rooms and arcs in this caravanserai prove that Kharanaq was a busy place where many travelers used to stay . It has a yard in the center and it is surrounded by rooms . Today , tourists can reserve the rooms and spend the nights at Kharanaq Village Caravanserai .
Kharanaq bath
The bathhouse was constructed during the Qajar Dynasty . One of its key features is the principled and skillful design of the water and sewage inlet and outlet system for optimal use of water resources . The bath is built in such a way that the water of the Qanat 's ( subterranean canals ) are easily directed into it .
Kharanaq 's Mosque and ḥosayniya
It is a Shabestani planned mosque connected to the ḥosayniya . The Shabestan is still in use and also there is a smaller mosque outside Kharanaq castle , right in front of the gate .
History
Kharanaq means 'place of birth of the sun ' and has been continuously inhabited for 4,500 years . It divides into two parts ; the Old Town , with its collection of mud brick buildings and a caravanserai , and the New Town , where more than 400 people continue to live . Kharanaq was prosperous in farming , but with the water supply drying up , the inhabitants left , leaving the old town in ruin .

Robert Gurney ( 31 July 1879 – 5 March 1950 ) was a British zoologist from the Gurney family , most famous for their monographs on British Freshwater Copepoda ( 1931–1933 ) and the Larvae of Decapod Crustacea ( 1942 ) . They were not affiliated with any institution , but worked at home , initially in Norfolk , and later near Oxford . They travelled to North Africa and Bermuda , and received material from other foreign expeditions , including the Terra Nova Expedition ( 1910–1913 ) and the Discovery Investigations of the 1920s and 1930s .
Biography
Robert Gurney was born in 1879 as the fourth son of John Gurney ( 1845–1887 ) and Isabel Charlotte Gurney ( later Baroness Talbot de Malahide ) of Sprowston Hall , Norfolk . They went to school at Eton College , and went on to study at New College , Oxford , graduating with first class honours in 1902 . They were awarded a D.Sc . by the University of Oxford in 1927 . They were never associated with any institution , but worked from their home , initially near Stalham , Norfolk , but from 1928 at Boars Hill , outside Oxford . They became a lifelong friend of Walter Garstang after the two men met while Garstang was running Easter Classes at Plymouth , which Gurney was attending as an undergraduate . Gurney went on to marry Garstang 's sister , Gamzu ( 1878–1972 ) . Later , Garstang 's daughter married Alister Hardy , strengthening Gurney 's connections with zoology .
Robert and Gamzu had one child , Oliver Gurney ( 1911-2001 ) , who became a leading Assyriologist and Hittitologist .
Scientific work
Gurney 's first scientific work was a paper on metamorphosis in the crab Corystes cassivelaunus , which they published in 1902 while still an undergraduate at the University of Oxford . Two more papers on decapods appeared in 1903 , and 1904 saw their first paper on freshwater copepods . Realising the need for a specialist field station for freshwater biology to match the marine biological stations at Plymouth ( Marine Biological Association ) and Naples ( ) , Robert and their brother Eustace ( later Lord Mayor of Norwich ) set up Great Britain 's first freshwater laboratory at Sutton Broad . This station did not survive the First World War , but Gurney was later among the founders of the Freshwater Biological Association , which set up the field station on Windermere .
Gurney 's two great study objects were the Copepoda and the larvae of Decapoda , and their greatest works were the three-volume monograph British Freshwater Copepoda , published by the Ray Society in 1931–1933 , and their Larvae of Decapod Crustacea published by the Ray Society in 1942 . Perhaps through the influence of Garstang , Gurney rejected Ernst Haeckel 's biogenetic law ( that `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' ) , preferring Garstang 's concept of paedomorphosis as an explanation for the similarities between copepods and decapod larvae . Gurney was , however , very tentative in their speculations .
Expeditions
Gurney took part in several expeditions , including one to North Africa in 1906 , and the Cambridge University Suez Expedition in 1924 . They also worked on material collected by other expeditions , including the Terra Nova Expedition ( 1910–1913 ) , the Discovery Investigations ( 1920s and 1930s ) and the Great Barrier Reef Expedition of 1928–1929 . Gurney returned to the Red Sea , visiting the marine laboratory at Hurghada in 1936 , and visited Bermuda twice : once with Walter Garstang in 1935 , and once with both Garstang and Marie V. Lebour in 1938 .

Clintonia udensis is a species of flowering plant in the lily family Liliaceae . It is the only species of Clintonia native to Asia . It prefers sparsely forested habitat including the alpine forests of the Himalayas .
Description
Clintonia udensis is a perennial herbaceous plant that spreads by means of underground rhizomes , forming colonies on the floors of temperate forests . It has 3 -- 5 egg-shaped to elliptical leaves , each leaf long and wide . The leaf margins are pubescent when young . The pubescent stem ( technically , a scape ) is long . While fruiting , the stem elongates up to long . The inflorescence is 3 -- 12-flowered , in short terminal racemes with densely pubescent pedicels . The tepals are white , sometimes bluish , each tepal long . The berries are dark blue , almost black , up to across .
Taxonomy
Clintonia udensis was first described by Ernst Rudolf von Trautvetter and Carl Anton von Meyer in 1856 . The specific epithet udensis , which means `` from the River Uda or the Uden district of Siberia '' , evidently refers to a region in the Russian Far East where the plant is known to occur .
, Plants of the World Online accepts the following infraspecific names :
Clintonia udensis var . alpina ( Kunth ex Baker ) H.Hara
Clintonia udensis var . udensis
The word alpina means `` of upland or mountainous regions '' . Indeed , members of C. u. var . alpina are exclusively found above in the Himalayas .
Some authorities do not accept the above infraspecific names . The claim is that there are no morphological characters that consistently separate the two varieties .
Distribution
Clintonia udensis is wide-ranging , from the Russian Far East to southeast Asia , extending east-west from the Kuril Islands in the Pacific Ocean to the Western Himalaya region .

The black-crowned antpitta ( Pittasoma michleri ) is a species of bird in the gnateater family , Conopophagidae . It is found in Colombia , Costa Rica , and Panama . Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist foothill forests .
Taxonomy and systematics
The black-crowned antpitta is one of two species in the genus Pittasoma . They are not in the antpitta family ( Grallaridae ) . It was formerly placed in the antthrush family ( Formicariidae ) before being included in the antpitta family when it was split from the antthrushs . They were reclassified and placed in the family Conopophagidae based on DNA evidence . This placement is further supported by morphology , vocalisations and traits in their natural history .
The generic name Pittasoma comes from the genus Pitta and the Greek sōma , meaning `` body '' . The specific name is in honor of Brigadier-General Nathaniel Michler . Alternative names for the black-crowned antpitta include the black-crowned pittasoma or black-crowned gnatpitta .
Subspecies
There are two recognised subspecies :
P. m. michleri - Cassin , 1860 : The nominate subspecies , it is found in most of Panama and extreme northwestern Colombia .
P. m. zeledoni - Ridgway , 1884 : Occurs in the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica and in western Panama . The subspecific name is in honor of José Castulo Zeledón .
Description
The black-crowned antpitta is 18-19 cm long and weighs 99-110 grams .
Distribution and habitat
The black-crowned antpitta is found in Panama , Costa Rica , and northwestern Colombia . It mostly inhabits altitudes between 300 and 1000 m in Costa Rica , but is also found in lowlands in Panama .
Behaviour and ecology
Diet
Feeds on invertebrates such as insects , spiders , amblypygi , and scorpions along with small vertebrates such as frogs and small reptiles .

Tromp was a Dutch fourth-rate ship of the line launched at Rotterdam in 1777 . The Royal Navy captured them at the Capitulation of Saldanha Bay on 17 August 1796 . The Royal Navy took them into service as HMS Tromp , sometimes referred to as HMS Van Tromp . In British service they served as a prison , troop , store , guard , hospital , or receiving ship until the Navy sold them in 1815 .
Dutch service and capture
As of 1 January 1788 , Tromp was lying at Helvoet .
The Royal Navy captured Tromp at Saldanha Bay on 17 August 1796 . They were under the command of Lieutenant Jan Valkenburg , and was carrying 280 crew and passengers .
British service
The British commissioned Tromp in December 1796 under Captain Andrew Todd . In February 1797 Captain John Turnor of was made post captain into Tromp , replacing Todd . Turnor transferred to and in November Captain Billy Douglas replaced them in Tromp . Between 3 January and 19 April 1798 , Tromp was at Portsmouth being fitted as a 24-gun troopship . Captain Richard Hill commissioned them in February .
On 1 January 1799 , Tromp was off Ireland . On 16 January , Van Tromp arrived at Spithead with the transport ship Abbey . They were coming from Cork , Ireland , with 620 French prisoners . By 19 March , they were at Spithead , being fitted as a store ship . On 7 April , they sailed from Portsmouth with for Dublin . They were carrying the West York militia . Other warships , also armed en flute , were carrying the Oxford and the Cambridge militias .
In June Captain Richard Worsley took command of Tromp , but paid them off in December . In January 1800 the Admiralty ordered them to be fitted out as a prison ship for the West Indies . Between February and June they were at Chatham being fitted out . In April Commander Terence O'Neill commissioned them as a troopship .
On 17 July Tromp , , and left Portsmouth with a convoy to the West . Indies . At Port Royal Tromp took up their role as a prison ship . Them first commander was Lieutenant Felix Frankling ( acting ) , and then in 1800 Lieutenant William Byam . Lieutenant John Fitzgerald replaced Byam and held command until 1802 . Tromp returned to Britain in September and was paid off . Commander John A. Norway recommissioned Tromp in June 1803 . They were fitted at Portsmouth as a guardship in August . They became a hospital ship at Falmouth in January 1806 under the command of Lieutenant Michael M'Carthy .
However , they may have reverted to the role of guardship under Norway 's command . On 6 June 1806 a court martial dismissed Norway from the Navy . The ship 's carpenter had accused Norway of converting the king 's stores to their private purposes , and for making false musters . The court found the charge of converting not proven , but convicted Norway of the false musters .
Then on 28 August 1807 , Tromp detained the Danish ships Diamond and Karen Louisa . , , , and were in sight and so shared in the proceeds of the seizure .
M'Carthy remained commander of Tromp though 1810 . Then between April and May 1811 they were fitted as a receiving ship .
Fate
Tromp was in ordinary at Portsmouth between 1812 and 1814 . The Navy sold them there for £700 on 9 August 1815 .

In mathematics and theoretical physics , a quasi-sphere is a generalization of the hypersphere and the hyperplane to the context of a pseudo-Euclidean space . It may be described as the set of points for which the quadratic form for the space applied to the displacement vector from a centre point is a constant value , with the inclusion of hyperplanes as a limiting case .
Notation and terminology
This article uses the following notation and terminology :
A pseudo-Euclidean vector space , denoted , is a real vector space with a nondegenerate quadratic form with signature . The quadratic form is permitted to be definite ( where or ) , making this a generalization of a Euclidean vector space .
A pseudo-Euclidean space , denoted , is a real affine space in which displacement vectors are the elements of the space . It is distinguished from the vector space .
The quadratic form acting on a vector , denoted , is a generalization of the squared Euclidean distance in a Euclidean space . Élie Cartan calls the scalar square of .
The symmetric bilinear form acting on two vectors is denoted or . This is associated with the quadratic form .
Two vectors are orthogonal if .
A normal vector at a point of a quasi-sphere is a nonzero vector that is orthogonal to each vector in the tangent space at that point .
Definition
A quasi-sphere is a submanifold of a pseudo-Euclidean space consisting of the points for which the displacement vector from a reference point satisfies the equation
,
where and .
Since in permitted , this definition includes hyperplanes ; it is thus a generalization of generalized circles and their analogues in any number of dimensions . This inclusion provides a more regular structure under conformal transformations than if they are omitted .
This definition has been generalized to affine spaces over complex numbers and quaternions by replacing the quadratic form with a Hermitian form .
A quasi-sphere in a quadratic space has a counter-sphere . Furthermore , if and is an isotropic line in through , then , puncturing the union of quasi-sphere and counter-sphere . One example is the unit hyperbola that forms a quasi-sphere of the hyperbolic plane , and its conjugate hyperbola , which is its counter-sphere .
Geometric characterizations
Centre and radial scalar square
The centre of a quasi-sphere is a point that has equal scalar square from every point of the quasi-sphere , the point at which the pencil of lines normal to the tangent hyperplanes meet . If the quasi-sphere is a hyperplane , the centre is the point at infinity defined by this pencil .
When , the displacement vector of the centre from the reference point and the radial scalar square may be found as follows . We put , and comparing to the defining equation above for a quasi-sphere , we get
The case of may be interpreted as the centre being a well-defined point at infinity with either infinite or zero radial scalar square ( the latter for the case of a null hyperplane ) . Knowing ( and ) in this case does not determine the hyperplane 's position , though , only its orientation in space .
The radial scalar square may take on a positive , zero or negative value . When the quadratic form is definite , even though and may be determined from the above expressions , the set of vectors satisfying the defining equation may be empty , as is the case in a Euclidean space for a negative radial scalar square .
Diameter and radius
Any pair of points , which need not be distinct , ( including the option of up to one of these being a point at infinity ) defines a diameter of a quasi-sphere . The quasi-sphere is the set of points for which the two displacement vectors from these two points are orthogonal .
Any point may be selected as a centre ( including a point at infinity ) , and any other point on the quasi-sphere ( other than a point at infinity ) define a radius of a quasi-sphere , and thus specifies the quasi-sphere .
Partitioning
Referring to the quadratic form applied to the displacement vector of a point on the quasi-sphere from the centre ( i.e . ) as the radial scalar square , in any pseudo-Euclidean space the quasi-spheres may be separated into three disjoint sets : those with positive radial scalar square , those with negative radial scalar square , those with zero radial scalar square .
In a space with a positive-definite quadratic form ( i.e . a Euclidean space ) , a quasi-sphere with negative radial scalar square is the empty set , one with zero radial scalar square consists of a single point , one with positive radial scalar square is a standard -sphere , and one with zero curvature is a hyperplane that is partitioned with the -spheres .

Fieldgate Street Great Synagogue , established in 1899 , was located at 41 Fieldgate Street in the East End of London . This synagogue 's official Hebrew name was Sha'ar Ya'akov ( Gate of Jacob , שער יעקב ) , but it became known as the Fieldgate Street Great Synagogue , as there were several smaller synagogues along the street .
It was built with a ninety-year lease of land previously occupied by a private house and workshop that served as a home of ginger-beer maker and a tea chest dealer . This was part of a synagogue project by the Federation of Synagogues , which oversaw the amalgamation of three small through appeals that condemned existing premises as unsuitable for public worship . Building costs were estimated at £3,500 , from which the Federation of Synagogues contributed £500 , private members raised £700 and Samuel Montagu put down at least £200 of their own money .
Upon establishment , Samuel Montagu was made honorary president , while Nathaniel Charles Rothschild performed the opening ceremony . Solomon Michaels , a clothier , was the acting president . William Whiddington , a city-based architect , was commissioned to design the synagogue , to comply with an Ashkenazi shul tradition . It was purchased by the East London Mosque in July 2015 .
Original building plan
A ‘ house ' in front of the synagogue , three stories high , comprised a shop , a first-floor caretaker 's flat and a top-floor committee room . To the right of the shopfront , double iron gates opened outwards for two entrances , as a synagogue requires segregation of men and women :
The women 's door led directly to a staircase accessing the gallery , and the men 's led to a corridor to the main floor of the synagogue behind . The synagogue itself was in a spacious , well-lit and ventilated , long room which could accommodate for 280 men below and 240 women in the three-sided gallery . On two tiers of paired Corinthian columns , the ceiling rose to a part-glazed seven-sided central vault . The bimah ( reading platform ) was in the centre , flanked by high-backed benches on the long walls . Extra rows were inserted behind the bimah . The ark ( containing the Torah scrolls ) was set against the back wall at the north end , it had a tall upper tier with large luhot ( Decalogue tablets ) flanked by lions of Judah and topped by a semi-dome . Above it was a large round window . It did not point to Jerusalem as is traditional , as it was impractical to do so with the building 's south orientation .
History
The Synagogue After WW2
The synagogue was badly damaged during the Blitz as many structures in the East End were . A first phase of essential repair with new steel-work and concrete roofing for the main hall was carried out in 1947–8 through Lewis Solomon & Son , architects , with S. H. & D. E. White , civil engineers , and R. H. Rhodes Ltd , builder . Work on the hall and gallery , retaining the Corinthian columns , was completed in 1952 by Ashby and Horner Ltd , builders , under the oversight of another successor firm , Lewis Solomon , Son & Joseph , and the synagogue 's chairperson , Nathan Zlotnicki . The 'house ' in front of the synagogue was refurbished as a ‘ communal centre ' during 1959–60 , Ashby & Horner giving it a reconfigured ground-floor layout and a plain front , brick above a rendered lower storey . New dedicatory inscriptions were put in place above and beside the main entrance .
Under the leadership of the Rev . Leibish Gayer , the refurbishment kept the humbleness of the old building . The passage along the east wall led into the shul where the marbled columns and some old pews survived , the remade ark bore humbler luhot and carved and gilt-painted Lions of Judah . To the left of the ark was a stone Royal Family prayer tablet , a tradition imported from seventeenth-century Amsterdam that is common in more Anglicised synagogues . Above the ark two high-level round windows were given Star of David stained glass . There were also Star of David light fittings , and a large ceiling lantern lit the whole space . Panelled gallery fronts served as donation boards , bearing commemorative inscriptions .
The Synagogue in the 2000s
By the early 2000s , the synagogue had a reduced capacity of just 150 , and attendances continued to fall gradually as the local Jewish population in the East End declined . A movable curtained trellis mechitzah was installed at the rear of the ground floor for a dwindling number of elderly women , so that they no longer had to climb the stairs to attend at the original women section on the second level .
By November 2009 , regular services were stopped , and the synagogue was open only once a month for a symbolic Shabbat services .
The Federation of Synagogues had sold the building to the East London Mosque in 2015 which had by then enclosed the small synagogue building which was dwarfed by it . In a conversion of 2016 designed by Makespace Architects , furnishings were removed and a new shopfront was created for a Zakat Centre ( for the receipt of donations to charity ) .
The Fieldgate Street Great Synagogue was the last active synagogue in Whitechapel proper .

Florene Miller Watson ( December 7 , 1920 – February 4 , 2014 ) was an American aviator and educator from Texas . Watson was one of the first Women 's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron ( WAFS ) volunteers . They went on to fly for the Women Air Force Service Pilots ( WASP ) throughout World War II . During that time , they worked as a trainer , ferried aircraft and was a test pilot .
Biography
Watson was born as Florene Miller in San Angelo , Texas on December 7 , 1920 . Them first airplane ride was at the age of 8 when they had the chance to ride in a WWI Barnstormer . They started attending Baylor College in 1938 . They and their father both enjoyed airplanes and when they were in their second year of college , their father bought a Luscombe airplane so they and their family could learn to fly . Watson went home to learn to fly with their father .
Watson finished flight school and had their first solo fight by age 19 . They went on to earn their commercial pilot 's license , their ground-school and flight instructor ratings and also learned aerobatics . They started teaching men to fly in the War Training Program in Odessa . Them father and their brother died in a plane crash on July 4 , 1941 .
When Pearl Harbor was attacked , they volunteered for the Army Air Corps . In 1942 , Watson became one of the 25 women who were qualified for the original Women 's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron ( WAFS ) which later became the Women Air Force Service Pilots ( WASP ) . In January 1943 , they became the Commanding officer of the WASPs stationed at Love Field , Dallas . The next year , they started working as a test pilot . Watson got the chance to fly all of the aircraft used by the Air Corps during the war , with their favorite being the American P-51 Mustang .
After the war , Watson chose not to fly again . They felt that they had flown every plane they wanted to and that being a pilot would take money away from their family . They said , `` I had accomplished everything I wanted to accomplish . '' Watson married Chris Watson , a former flight student of theirs and together they raised two daughters . Watson attended Lamar State College of Technology , where they majored in secretarial science . They earned their MBA from the University of Houston ( UH ) . They taught college for 30 years , working at UH , Howard College and Frank Phillips College .
Watson was featured in the 1993 documentary , Women of Courage , shown on PBS . They became the first woman to be inducted into the Panhandle Veterans Hall of Fame in 1996 . In 2001 , Watson was part of the Gathering of Eagles . They were inducted into the Women in Aviation International Pioneer Hall of Fame in 2005 . They died on February 4 , 2014 .

The banded pittas , Hydrornis ( guajana ) spp. , are a group of birds in the family Pittidae that were formerly lumped as a single species , the banded pitta . They are found in forest in the Thai-Malay Peninsula and the Greater Sundas .
Description
The group includes four birds , which can be divided into three main groups : The species from Java and Bali has a yellow eyebrow , underparts that are densely barred in yellowish and blackish-blue and a narrow blue band on the upper chest ; irena and ripleyi from the Thai-Malay Peninsula and Sumatra have a more orange eyebrow , a blue belly and a chest that is barred orange and dark bluish ( more orange towards the sides , blue towards the center ) ; and schwaneri from Borneo has a blue mid-belly and yellow flanks and chest densely barred with blackish . Females of all birds are significantly duller than the males . There are also vocal differences between these , and since 1993 they have been considered by several taxonomists to be better treated as three separate species :
Bornean banded pitta ( Hydrornis schwaneri )
Javan banded pitta ( Hydrornis guajana )
Malayan banded pitta ( Hydrornis irena )

St. Peter 's Church ( Sinhala : ශාන්ත පීතර දේවස්ථානය Santha Pithara Devasthanaya ) is one of the oldest continuously functioning churches in Colombo , Sri Lanka . It is located on Church Street in Colombo Fort , on the northern side of the Grand Oriental Hotel .
History
During the Portuguese occupation of the country a Dominican monastery and a charity hall , the Chapel of Misericordia ( House of Mercy ) were constructed on the site ( c.1627 ) , where the church is now located . Nearby was an early Gothic church , St. Dominico , of which only an inscribed stone set over its arches remains . In approximately 1666 , ten years after the capture of Colombo by the Dutch they converted the building into the official residence for the Governor , with an elegant two storey facades facing the waterfront . The mansion had a flat roof , a large arched portico of cubicle form , and several large windows that let in light and air . The building was used for council meetings , and a reception/banquet hall , where ambassadors from the Kingdom of Kandy were entertained .
The British firstly used the structure as the residence of Lieutenant general Hay MacDowall ( General Officer Commanding , Ceylon ) , though by this time the building was in a state of disrepair with the roof leaking badly . Between 1796 and 1803 , Wolvendaal Church was opened to Anglicans for worship . In 1804 the first British Governor , Frederick North , resolved to convert the building to a Garrison Church . publishing a notice on 14 March in The Ceylon Government Gazette announcing that a 'Divine Service will be held at the Government House on Sunday at 4.30 p.m ' . Between 1810 and 1820 a portion of the building was used temporarily as a court house . In 1816 the first Bishop of Calcutta , Thomas Middleton , attended and gave a sermon at the church . In April 1821 on the occasion of the second visit by the bishop , acting on the formal request by the acting Governor Edward Barnes , they `` consecrated and set apart forever for the service of God '' the church on 22 May . In the same year , Governor Barnes handed over St. Peter 's Church to four trustees .
Between September and December 1832 the church closed for repairs and during this time the verandah and portico with its classical masonry columns , typical of British buildings during this period were added . Very little vestiges of the original Dutch colonial architecture remain , with the exception of the clear storey windows and prominent gable walls .
The church and its cemetery contain a number of commemorative monuments , plaques and tombs , including William Tolfrey ( 1778–1817 ) , who translated the Bible into Pali and Sinhalese ; Thomas James Twistleton ( 1770–1824 ) , the first Archdeacon of Colombo ; Henry Matthews , Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court ; George Steuart ( 1808–1896 ) , founder of George Steuarts ; Louise Rodney ( 1778–1814 ) , wife of John Rodney , Colonial Secretary of Ceylon ( 1806–1833 ) ; Sir Charles Peter Layard ( 1806–1893 ) , the first Mayor of Colombo ( 1866–1877 ) ; and the soldiers from the Worcestershire Regiment 2nd Battalion , who died whilst serving in Ceylon between 1904 and 1906 .
The first chaplain was the Rev . James Cordiner , who arrived in Colombo in 1799 and left in 1804 . They were succeeded by the Rev . Thomas James Twisleton followed by Rev . George Bisset , Ven . J. M. S. Glenie , and then Rev . Benjamin Bailey . The first Bishop of Colombo , Dr. James Chapman , was enthroned at St. Peter 's on 7 November 1845 .
During the Sri Lankan Civil War access to the church was highly restricted due to its location directly opposite the Colombo Harbour and adjacent to the Sri Lanka Police Headquarters .

Viwandani is an informal settlement ( known locally as a `` slum '' ) in the city of Nairobi , Kenya . It is an electoral ward within the Makadara Constituency of Nairobi County . It borders on the Nairobi Industrial Area . The name `` Viwandani '' means `` at the industrial zone '' in Kiswahili . There are thirteen `` villages '' within the settlement : Jamaica , Kingstone , Lunga Lunga Centre , Lunga Lunga Donholm , Milimani , Paradise A , B , and C , Riverside , Sinai , Sinali Reli , Tetrapak , and Uchumi .
Viwandani is one of two informal settlements included in the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System ( NUHDSS ) operated by the African Population and Health Research Center ( APHRC ) since 2002 . The NUHDSS collects data on demographic events ( births , deaths , and migrations ) , health outcomes ( morbidity , cause of death through verbal autopsy , child vaccination , and nutrition ) and socio-economic outcomes ( marriage , education , livelihood , and housing characteristics ) . It is the source for numerous research publications indexed on the APHRC website . ( The other informal settlement included in NUHDSS is Korogocho . )

Newsome was the first African-American undergraduate to be nominated for the prestigious Wasserman Award ( Spike Lee having won the award as a graduate student ) .
Newsome said that their experience as a black woman working in the horror and sci-fi film genres inspired them to become an activist . Speaking as part of a panel at Spelman College in 2014 , they said : `` The space that exists for many of us , as a young black girl , is so extremely limited so that you really ca n't go very far without being an activist , without being in defiance of something . ''
Activism
2013
Newsome was arrested in July 2013 at a sit-in at the office of then North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis while protesting North Carolina 's voter ID law .
2015
On June 27 , 2015 , they were arrested for taking down the Confederate battle flag that was displayed on the grounds of the South Carolina State House in direct action . Newsome , aged 30 , while scaling the pole , was hailed by police officers who told them to get down . They responded : `` In the name of Jesus , this flag has to come down . You come against me with hatred and oppression and violence . I come against you in the name of God . This flag comes down today . '' As they lowered the flag and descended into the arms of awaiting police officers , they announced they were prepared to be arrested . Newsome and a man who police said was helping her , James Ian Tyson , were arrested . Onlookers applauded Newsome 's efforts as they were being cuffed . As they were led away , they recited the 23rd Psalm from the Bible . The flag was raised again 45 minutes later .
Both activists were charged with defacing monuments on capitol grounds , a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or a maximum jail sentence of three years , and taken to Richland County Jail . A judge set a $ 3,000 bond for each .
Newsome 's act of civil disobedience made international headlines and television news . By late afternoon , a crowdfunding campaign had raised over $ 60,000 for their bail . Filmmaker Michael Moore offered on Twitter to pay their bail and legal fees . Todd Rutherford , the minority leader of the state House of Representatives , offered to represent Newsome in court . NAACP chapter president Reverend Doctor William Barber II applauded Newsome 's action , comparing it to those of Rosa Parks and other icons of the Civil Rights Movement . Colette Gaiter , an associate professor of art and social change at the University of Delaware , whose writing was republished by Time magazine , called the act `` a significant piece of socially engaged performance art '' . After their release , Newsome gave numerous magazine interviews and appeared on talk shows such as Democracy Now ! and The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore . They also appear in the award-winning 2015 documentary , Bars4justice .
Newsome 's actions were criticized by several South Carolina legislators who said that they were in favor of the flag 's removal , but illegal actions like Newsome 's could hurt their goal to have the flag permanently removed . Calls for the flag 's removal had been on the increase since the murder of nine people in the Charleston church shooting of June 17 .
Several days after their arrest , Newsome released a statement to Blue Nation Review revealing what propelled them to act .
I realized that now is the time for true courage the morning after the Charleston Massacre shook me to the core of my being . I could n't sleep . I sat awake in the dead of night . All the ghosts of the past seemed to be rising .
Not long ago , I had watched the beginning of Selma , the reenactment of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and had shuddered at the horrors of history .
But this was neither a scene from a movie nor was it the past . A white man had just entered a black church and massacred people as they prayed . They had assassinated a civil rights leader . This was not a page in a textbook I was reading nor an inscription on a monument I was visiting .
A vote on the presence of the flag took place among South Carolina 's House of Representatives on July 9 , which resulted in the final removal of the flag the following Friday . The charges against Newsome and Tyson were later dropped .
2016
As a presidential candidate speaking at a Martin Luther King Day 2016 celebration in Charleston , Hillary Clinton credited Newsome for taking the matter into their own hands by `` shimmying up that flagpole '' as a step in the process . `` Every year , you 've gathered right here and said that that symbol of division and racism went against everything Dr. King stood for . We could n't celebrate them and the Confederacy , we had to choose . And South Carolina finally made the right choice . ''
In February 2016 , Newsome told Ebony magazine that they had been motivated in part by their ancestors having been enslaved and subjected to racial terrorism in South Carolina .
2017
Newsome has continued to speak on race-related issues such as affirmative action . They have given interviews to newspapers and magazines such as The Crisis , Vox , and Marie Claire , made television appearances , and given public speeches at colleges and other venues . Following the deadly terrorist attack in Charlottesville , Virginia , on August 17 , 2017 , Newsome 's op-ed piece and video commentary appeared in The Washington Post .
Beginning in 2017 , Newsome has worked as an activist for housing rights .
2021
In a October 13 , 2021 podcast discussing a book titled Abolition for the People : The Movement for a Future Without Policing and Prisons written by Colin Kaepernick , Newsome argued all law enforcement criminal justice and prisons should be completely abolished .

The 2021–22 Wagner Seahawks men 's basketball team represented Wagner College during the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men 's basketball season . The Seahawks were led by 10th-year head coach Bashir Mason . They played their home games at Spiro Sports Center on the school 's Staten Island campus as members of the Northeast Conference .
Previous season
In a season limited due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic , the Seahawks finished the season 13–7 , 13–5 in NEC play to win the regular season championship . They lost in the semifinals of the NEC Tournament to Mount St. Mary 's . Due to the ongoing pandemic , the National Invitation Tournament was modified and , as a result , did not award bids to teams who had won their regular season championship , but failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament . The Seahawks did not receive a bid to the NIT .
Roster
Schedule and results
Following wins in the first two games of the season , the Seahawks were forced to postpone three consecutive non-conference games due to COVID-19 issues within the program . They returned to play on December 1 , but were without head coach Mason and two of their leading scorers .
NEC COVID-19 policy provided that if a team could not play a conference game due to COVID-19 issues within its program , the game would be declared a forfeit and the other team would receive a conference win . However , wins related to COVID-19 do not count pursuant to NCAA policy .

In geometry , the biggest little polygon for a number n is the n-sided polygon that has diameter one ( that is , every two of its points are within unit distance of each other ) and that has the largest area among all diameter-one n-gons . One non-unique solution when n = 4 is a square , and the solution is a regular polygon when n is an odd number , but the solution is irregular otherwise .
Quadrilaterals
For n = 4 , the area of an arbitrary quadrilateral is given by the formula S = pq sin ( θ ) /2 where p and q are the two diagonals of the quadrilateral and θ is either of the angles they form with each other . In order for the diameter to be at most 1 , both p and q must themselves be at most 1 . Therefore , the quadrilateral has the largest area when the three factors in the area formula are individually maximized , with p = q = 1 and sin ( θ ) = 1 . The condition that p = q means that the quadrilateral is an equidiagonal quadrilateral ( its diagonals have equal length ) , and the condition that sin ( θ ) = 1 means that it is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral ( its diagonals cross at right angles ) . The quadrilaterals of this type include the square with unit-length diagonals , which has area 1/2 . However , infinitely many other orthodiagonal and equidiagonal quadrilaterals also have diameter 1 and have the same area as the square , so in this case the solution is not unique .
Odd numbers of sides
For odd values of n , it was shown in by Karl Reinhardt in 1922 that a regular polygon has the largest area among all diameter-one polygons .
Even numbers of sides
In the case n = 6 , the unique optimal polygon is not regular . The solution to this case was published in 1975 by Ronald Graham , answering a question posed in 1956 by Hanfried Lenz ; it takes the form of an irregular equidiagonal pentagon with an obtuse isosceles triangle attached to one of its sides , with the distance from the apex of the triangle to the opposite pentagon vertex equal to the diagonals of the pentagon . Its area is 0.674981 .... , a number that satisfies the equation
4096 x10 +8192x9 − 3008x8 − 30848x7 + 21056x6 + 146496x5 − 221360x4 + 1232x3 + 144464x2 − 78488x + 11993 = 0 .
Graham conjectured that the optimal solution for the general case of even values of n consists in the same way of an equidiagonal ( n − 1 ) -gon with an isosceles triangle attached to one of its sides , its apex at unit distance from the opposite ( n − 1 ) -gon vertex . In the case n = 8 this was verified by a computer calculation by Audet et al .
Graham 's proof that their hexagon is optimal , and the computer proof of the n = 8 case , both involved a case analysis of all possible n-vertex thrackles with straight edges .
The full conjecture of Graham , characterizing the solution to the biggest little polygon problem for all even values of n , was proven in 2007 by Foster and Szabo .

Ølve Church ( ) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Kvinnherad Municipality in Vestland county , Norway . It is located in the village of Ølve . It is the church for the Ølve parish which is part of the Sunnhordland prosti ( deanery ) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin . The white , wooden church was built in a long church design in 1861 using plans drawn up by the architect Hans Linstow . The church seats about 230 people .
History
The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1432 , but it was not new that year . The first church in Ølve was probably a wooden stave church that may have been built during the 14th century . Nothing is known about that church . Around the 1640s , the old stave church was torn down and replaced with a new timber-framed building ( one source says that this may have happened in 1615 ) . The Barony Rosendal was established in 1678 and the church was given as part of the barony . In 1788 , the church was renovated . The church was owned by the Barony from 1678 until 1855 when it was sold to the municipality . Soon afterwards , the municipality determined that the old church needed to be replaced . In 1861 , the church was torn down and replaced with a new church on the same site . The new church was consecrated on 13 October 1861 . In 1953 , an extension on the north side of the choir was constructed during a major repair and rebuilding of the church that was carried out under the direction of architect Torgeir Alvsaker .

The crime of Cuenca consisted of a series of judicial miscarriages and police misconduct that involved torture and prison sentences for the defendants , for a crime that never existed . The alleged crime related to the disappearance of a shepherd in the province of Cuenca , Spain , in 1910 .
Background
In 1910 , José María Grimaldos López , a 28-year-old shepherd from Tresjuncos , went missing . They were nicknamed El Cepa ( the stump ) , apparently due to their low height and lack of intelligence . They worked at the farm of Francisco Antonio Ruiz , and was constantly mocked by the farm manager , León Sánchez , and also by the security guard Gregorio Valero . On August 20 , 1910 , Grimaldos sold a number of sheep belonging to him ; subsequently , they disappeared . Subsequently , it was found that they had gone to bathe at La Celadilla , a shallow lagoon where bathers covered themselves in mud reputed to have curative properties . La Celadilla is located in the municipality of El Pedernoso about from the town .
After several weeks of Grimaldos ' disappearance , rumours started to spread around the village about their possible murder , with the assumption that they were murdered by someone who wanted to steal the money they had earned from the sheep sale . Their family knew about the taunts that Grimaldos received—as they always talked about them at home—so decided to file a complaint over the disappearance in the court of Belmonte , accusing Sánchez and Valero of being the suspected perpetrators of the alleged crime . The two were arrested and put on trial ; in September 1911 , the case was dismissed . After the interrogation of the detainees , the summary of evidence was heard and the judge released the defendants due to the lack of evidence .
New prosecution and imprisonment
In 1913 , at the insistence of the Grimaldos ' relatives , the case was reopened . With the arrival in town of a new judge , Emilio Isasa Echenique , Grimaldos ' family reported the case again . Once again an arrest warrant was served on the same suspects .
The Civil Guard began torturing and mistreating the detainees to obtain confessions from the defendants and to discover what they had done with the missing corpse . On November 11 , 1913 when following the judge of Belmonte 's order , the judge of Osa de la Vega certified the death stating that José María Grimaldos López , native of Tresjuncos , died on August 21 , 1910 between 8.30 pm and 9.00 pm , murdered by Gregorio Valero and León Sánchez . The record reflects note in the margin : `` The body could not be identified because it has not been found '' .
In 1918 , after being in prison for four and a half years , the trial began against the defendants with a summary filled with contradictions and unclarified aspects . The trial ended with a sentence that condemned the defendants to 18 years of prison by order of the Provincial Court .
The court who sentenced the defendants deliberated for thirty minutes , and the twelve members composing the jury judged them responsible for the death of Grimaldos . The defendants managed to avoid the death penalty , as the garrote was then still in use at the time . Valero served time in the prison of San Miguel de los Reyes in Valencia , whereas Sánchez served their sentence in the prison of Cartagena .
Reprieve
On July 4 , 1925 , they left jail after serving 12 years and two months of their sentence , as a consequence of two decrees of pardon .
Reappearance of José María Grimaldos
On February 8 , 1926 , the priest of Tresjuncos received a letter from the priest of the municipality of Mira ( 113 km/70 miles away ) , who requested the baptism certificate of José María Grimaldos in order to celebrate their marriage . The priest of Tresjuncos , astonished by the news , decided not to respond to the priest of Mira . After some time , José María Grimaldos became impatient with the delay to their marriage and set off for Tresjuncos . When they showed up in the village , the villagers could not believe what they saw . The judge of Belmonte then interceded and ordered the arrest of the man . Within hours , the press released the news and it had a huge impact on public opinion .
After the indisputable identification of Grimaldos , the Minister of Grace and Justice ordered the retrial of the case and ordered the prosecutor of the Supreme Court to appeal for revision against the sentence of the hearing of Cuenca . On the asupervisorstioned order it is noted that `` there are reasonable grounds to believe that the confession of Valero and Sánchez , essential basis of their convictions , were extracted under exceptional continuous violence '' .
Aftermath
The Supreme Court declared the ruling issued in Cuenca in 1918 void . As well as establishing Sánchez and Valero 's innocence , the supreme court established the nullity of José María Grimaldos ' death certificate , and established the corresponding compensations that the State had to pay to the prisoners in such cases .
A trial was held of those held responsible for the miscarriage of justice .
Sánchez and Valero moved to Madrid ; there , they were offered jobs as security guards in the city hall .
In literature and theater
The writer Alicio Garcitoral , Cuenca 's Civil Governor at the time these events occurred , wrote the social novel El Crimen de Cuenca ( 1932 ) reprinted with prologue and edition by José Esteban in 1981 . Some time later , the well-known writer Ramón J. Sender wrote the novel El lugar de un hombre ( 1939 ) . The writer Luis Esteso y López de Haro , native of San Clemente , Cuenca , wrote some four-lined stanzas with the name El Crimen de Cuenca , which were edited in one of their numerous collections ( Madrid , G. Hernández and Galo Sáez , 1927 ) .
Pilar Miró , the producer , made a film in 1979 entitled The Crime of Cuenca ; it was scripted by Lola Salvador Maldonado , who also narrates the facts in a book published with the same name by the editorial Argos Vergara . The film makes a strong plea against torture and it is perfectly understood that the crime the title refers to is the one committed by the Civil Guard when torturing the suspects . The mathematician Carlos Maza Gómez also studies the case in their book Crímenes in 1926 .

Paul Desmond is an album by saxophonist Paul Desmond recorded in 1975 at the Bourbon Street jazz club in Toronto and released on the Artists House labels in 1978 . The album 's tracks were remixed and re-released in 2020 as part of the Mosaic Records boxed set The Complete 1975 Toronto Recordings .
Reception
Allmusic reviewer by Richard S. Ginell said `` After Desmond 's death in May 1977 , bassist Don Thompson went through the rejected tapes of the live sessions he , Desmond , guitarist Ed Bickert , and drummer Jerry Fuller had made in Toronto for the album The Paul Desmond Quartet Live and came up with an extra LP of fresh material . The results came out not on A & M/Horizon but on producer John Snyder 's tiny Artists House label , so this will be hard to find . But when you do find it , you 'll hear Desmond in nearly peak form '' .

The GROW model ( or process ) is a simple method for goal setting and problem-solving . It was developed in the United Kingdom and has been used extensively in corporate coaching from the late 1980s and 1990s .
Stages of GROW
There are a number of different versions of the GROW model . The following table presents one view of the stages but there are others . The `` O '' in this version has two meanings .
As with many simple principles , any user of GROW can apply a great deal of skill and knowledge at each stage but the basic process remains as written above . There are numerous questions which the coach could use at any point and part of the skill of the coach is to know which questions to use and how much detail to uncover .
Example
The following is a very simple example of using the GROW model to achieve a goal . This example deals with weight loss . If the client wants : `` To bring my weight down to 120 pounds in three months and keep it down '' , that is their Goal . The more heartfelt and personal , the more meaningful the goal is to the person and the more likely they will be to commit to and achieve the goal .
The GROW approach would then be to establish the Reality by stating what their weight is now . The coach would then ask awareness questions to deepen understanding of what is happening when the client tries to lose weight , thus identifying the Obstacles . These questions could include :
When you have been able to lose weight—what made the difference ?
What is the difference between the times you are able to keep weight off and the times when you put it on again ?
What would have to change for you to be sure you could lose the weight and keep it off ?
If the client genuinely answers these questions they will discover new information about what works and does not work for them in terms of weight loss , and create some potential for change . It then becomes possible to create some strategies or Options which get around the Obstacles . These could include looking at which diets or exercise regimes work best , or finding a specific type of support . Once the client knows the strategies that are likely to work they can establish a Way Forward which involves taking action steps . This is where they commit to what they will do in the short term to put the strategies into effect . For instance , one action might be asking a particular person for support , and another might be to buy a different selection of foods .
GROW neatly highlights the nature of a problem for coaching purposes . In order for a problem to exist in coaching terms there has to be two elements present . Firstly there has to be something that the client is trying to achieve—the Goal . Then there has to be something stopping them achieve that goal—the Obstacle ( s ) . Using GROW automatically breaks a problem down into these component parts .
The same principles can be applied whatever goal or problem the client has . GROW can be used on technical problems , issues regarding processes , strategy questions , interpersonal issues and many more . The model can also be used by a group who are all working on the same problem or goal .
History
In a 2009 article , John Whitmore claimed that Max Landsberg coined the name GROW during a conversation with Graham Alexander and that Whitmore was the first to publish it in the 1992 first edition of their book Coaching for Performance . Landsberg also published it a few years later in the 1996 first edition of their book The Tao of Coaching . Elsewhere Whitmore said that the model had been in use for some time before it was given the name GROW . Alan Fine 's 2010 book You Already Know How to Be Great claimed that Fine had codeveloped the model with Whitmore and Alexander . Other ( later ) similar models include collaborative helping maps in family therapy and Gabriele Oettingen 's WOOP model .
The GROW principle and the Inner Game
GROW was influenced by the Inner Game method developed by Timothy Gallwey . Gallwey was a tennis coach who noticed that they could often see what players were doing incorrectly but that simply telling them what they should be doing did not bring about lasting change .
The parallel between Gallwey 's Inner Game method and the GROW method can be illustrated by the example of players who do not keep their eyes on the ball . Some coaches might give instructions such as : `` Keep your eye on the ball '' to try to correct this . The problem with this sort of instruction is that a player will be able to follow it for a short while but may be unable to keep it in mind in the long term . So one day , instead of giving an instruction , Gallwey asked players to say `` bounce '' out loud when the ball bounced and `` hit '' out loud when they hit the ball .
The result was that the players started to improve without a lot of effort because they were keeping their eyes on the ball . But because of the way the instruction was given they did not have a voice in their heads saying `` I must keep my eye on the ball . '' Instead they were playing a simple game while they were playing tennis . Once Gallwey saw how play could be improved in this way , they stopped giving instructions and started asking questions that would help players discover for themselves what worked and what needed to change .
The GROW method is similar . For example , the first stage in the learning process would be to set a target which a player wants to achieve . If a player wanted to improve their first serve Gallwey would ask how many first serves out of ten they would like to get in . This is the Goal . The Reality would be defined by asking the player to serve 10 balls and seeing how many first serves went in .
Gallwey would then ask awareness-raising questions such as `` What do you notice you are doing differently when the ball goes in or out ? '' This question would enable players to discover for themselves what was changing about their mind and body when the serve went in or out . They had then defined their Obstacles and Options . They therefore learned for themselves what had to change in order to meet their serving targets and they had a clear Way Forward .
The originators of both the Inner Game method and the GROW method suggested that many individuals were struggling to achieve goals because they were not learning from experience and were not aware of the available knowledge that would help them .
Limitations
Jonathan Passmore and Stefan Cantore suggested in 2012 that one `` argument against behavioural-based approaches such as GROW is that their goal nature excludes the potential to explore philosophical aspects of life . Thus GROW may be suited to working in goal-directed areas of sports or business , but may be less well suited to career conversations , person–role fit or life-coaching conversations where other approaches such as the transpersonal or existential approaches may be more helpful . '' See also for a response to this criticism suggesting that GROW has evolved to include transpersonal goals .

Toy ( established 2002 in Bergen , Norway ) is an electronic duo formed by musician and producer Jørgen Træen from Bergen and the Bergen-based composer Alisdair Stirling originally from London .
Biography
Toy released the single Rabbit Pushing Mower/Valley Cars ( 2002 ) as a vinyl seven inches on Telle Records described by the BBC as an amusing cream puff of a tune . The next single was released on the label Smalltown Supersound , Sedan Through Tunnel/Decorama . Both of these singles was sold out quickly . The debut album by the duo Toy ( 2006 ) , was the released on Smalltown Supersound , and received brilliant criticism . The track `` Rabbit Pushing Mower '' opened their friend Annie ` s DJ Kicks mix album for Studio K7 ( 2005 ) . Jørgen Træen runs Duper Studios in Bergen together with Yngve Sætre , where they collaborate with the likes of Röyksopp , Datarock and Bjørn Torske . Træen is a highly recognized producer that has produced albums for Sondre Lerche , Magnet and Jaga Jazzist , among others . They also have their own solo project 'Sir Dupermann ' on Smalltown Supersound . Although a Londoner Stirling has their roots in Bergen where they are the driving force behind the Bergen pop workshop/collective 'House of Hiss ' .
In a review of Norwegian music flowering outside Norway , Nick Sylvester of the Pitchfork states :
`` 09 . Toy : Sedar Through Tunnel ( Smalltown Supersound ) - Most people are hearing about Toy from Annie 's DJ-Kicks mix , which opens with Toy 's `` Rabbit Pushing Mower '' track from way back , issued as a seven-inch on one of Bergenite Mikel Telle 's labels . I had said earlier my whole project with Norwegian music , at least at first , was to find songs that sound like Röyksopp 's `` Poor Leno '' —cold , lonely pop , bedroom danceparty shit ( though `` Leno '' killed Webster Hall when the boys came through ) . This track comes pretty damn close to the target sound , in no small part due to the haze of vocal samples , much like the Field 's Things Keep Falling Down EP on Kompakt this year . ''
... Another statement is :
`` Prozac-flavoured glory '' ( BBC radio 3 )
... and :
`` Sounds like a lot of fun being in Toy '' ( 4/5 , DJ Magazine )

Boli Khela or Bali Khela ( ) is a traditional form of wrestling in Bangladesh , particularly popular in the Chittagong area considered as a national game of the district . It is a form of combat sport involving grappling type techniques such as clinch fighting , throws and takedowns , joint locks , pins and other grappling holds . It is one of the oldest traditions of the Chittagong . The sporting event , held in the first month of the Bengali year date of 7th , always takes place at Madarsha Union as Mokkaro boli khela & same month date of 12th , always takes place at Laldighi Maidan as Jabbarer Boli khela .
Etymology
Boli means wrestler or a powerful person in Bengali , while Khela denotes a game . So , Boli Khela means game of the powerful person .
History
Boli Khela was introduced in the last 19th century by Kader Boxo . They were a landlord and resident of Satkania Upazila under Madarsha Union in Chittagong district . Reportedly , beginning in 1879 , during the first month of each year , they collected dues from their renters and arranged a boli khela match . After their death , the 7th of Boishakh , the first month of the Bengali calendar year , started being called `` Mokkaro Boli Khela '' .
A 20th century merchant , Abdul Jabbar Saodagor from Chittagong , arranged a boli khela in 1907 match to cultivate a sport that would prepare the youth to fight against British rule . Broad appeal for the sport began at the end of the First World War but subsided at the end of the Second World War .
Participation
The arena is either a circular or square shape , measuring at least fourteen to twenty feet across . Rather than using modern mats , Boli wrestlers train and compete on dirt floors . Match started in a sandy wrestling ground . Each year , Boli Khela attracts new participates and fans because the sheer enjoyment of the sport is not only contagious for local enthusiasts but inspires tourists to Bangladesh an opportunity to get a glimpse of an exciting and unique event . Fans of many countries come every year to see Boli khela .
Rules
The event starts at afternoon in a festive mood with the music of 'Dabor ' ( one kind of folk drum ) and 'Sanai ' ( folk flute ) . Each match lasts about 25–30 minutes but if both competitors agree , the length of the final match may be extended up to 10–15 minutes .
Great practitioners
Didar Boli , a trader from Omkhali under Ramu upazila in Cox 's Bazar district .
Oli Hossain of Brahmanbaria district .

Luigi Silori ( 19 November 1921 – 9 July 1983 ) was an Italian literary critic , novelist , playwright , and a popular radio and television personality in the 1950s and 1960s .
Descended from an old Umbrian family , at the beginning of their university studies Silori was called to military service and spent four years in the Italian army during World War II . Silori served in the ill-fated Acqui Division , and was a survivor of the Cephalonia Massacre . After 1945 , they graduated in Literature and started to write novels and theatrical texts . In 1954 they began appearing on both television and radio , and became very popular in Italy as `` the man who introduced the books on TV '' .
Biography
Early life and education
Luigi Silori was born in Rome in 1921 , an only son . Their father , Fernando , was a landowner in Stifone , and a descendant of an old family from Narni . Their mother , Antonietta Pacchelli , was a school teacher , who graduated in Rome in 1901 , when such a thing was very uncommon for a woman in Italy . They were also a piano teacher and writer .
Silori lived in an old house in Rome 's middle-class Quartiere Trieste . After primary school , they attended a distinguished grammar school , the classical gymnasium Torquato Tasso , where they had brilliant classmates , like the actor Vittorio Gassman ( who was their friend for decades ) and the theater director Luigi Squarzina .
World War II
At the beginning of 1941 , when they were still 19 years old , Silori was called up to serve as a gunnery lieutenant of the Italian Army in Greece with the 33rd Mountain Infantry Division `` Acqui '' , which occupied the island of Cephalonia during the Greco-Italian War . Following the Italian surrender on 8 September 1943 , thousands of soldiers from the division were murdered on the islands during Operation Achse , in what became known as the Cephalonia Massacre , one of the largest prisoner of war massacres during the war and one of the largest-scale German atrocities to be committed by Wehrmacht troops . Silori was one of the few officers who , by the end , had not been gunned down by the Wehrmacht , and they were subsequently deported to Germany and sent to the concentration camp at Meppen-Fullen .

Delaware Route 92 ( DE 92 ) is a road in northern New Castle County , Delaware , that runs a short distance to the south of the Pennsylvania/Delaware state line for most of its length . The route runs from DE 100 near Montchanin east to U.S. Route 13 ( US 13 ) in Claymont . The road is a two-lane rural road between the western terminus and US 202 , passing through Brandywine Creek State Park and the Brandywine Valley section of First State National Historical Park . East of US 202 , DE 92 is a four-lane divided highway called Naamans Road that passes through suburban areas to the north of Wilmington , with an interchange at Interstate 95 ( I-95 ) in Claymont . DE 92 was first built as a state highway east of US 202 during the 1920s and 1930s . By 1968 , the route was designated onto its current alignment . In the 1990s , DE 92 east of US 202 was widened into a divided highway .
Route description
DE 92 begins at the intersection with DE 100 and Adams Dam Road near Montchanin . The route runs northeast on two-lane undivided Thompson Bridge Road , crossing Wilson Run and passing through farmland to the north of Brandywine Creek State Park . The road continues into forested areas of the state park , crossing the Brandywine Creek . After the state park , DE 92 heads into areas of fields and woods within the Brandywine Valley section of First State National Historical Park , leaving the park and continuing northeast along Ramsey Road before curving to the north . The route turns east onto Beaver Valley Road , widening into a four-lane divided highway as it passes south of business parks and north of the Brandywine Campus of Wilmington University before it intersects US 202 in Brandywine .
Past the US 202 intersection , DE 92 becomes Naamans Road and passes to the south of the Brandywine Town Center shopping center , where a park and ride lot is located , as it continues into residential and commercial areas and intersects Shipley Road . Past the Brandywine Town Center , the route heads through neighborhoods in Brandywine A Hundred and has a junction with Grubb Road before it runs to the south of Concord High School and intersects Ebright Road , which goes north to Ebright Azimuth ( the highest point in Delaware ) and into Pennsylvania . After this , the road comes to an intersection with DE 261 in Ways Corner .
Farther east , DE 92 reaches a junction with the northern terminus of DE 3 in Hanbys Corner . Past the Darley Road intersection , the route passes north of a church that is home to a park and ride lot . From here , the road intersects Carpenter Station Road in Carpenter , where there is a park and ride lot on the southeast corner , before it crosses over CSX 's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line on a bridge and turns to the east-southeast . The route heads into business areas in Claymont and comes to a diamond interchange with I-95 at the northern terminus of I-495 ; the southbound exit at this interchange is from I-495 while the other ramps connect directly with I-95 . After the I-95 interchange , DE 92 passes to the south of the Tri-State Mall and crosses Naamans Creek before it has a westbound right-in/right-out intersection with the southern terminus of DE 491 . Past this intersection , the route turns southeast before ending at US 13 south of the Robinson House .
DE 92 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 30,848 vehicles at the Harvey Road intersection to a low of 6,643 vehicles at the Creek Road intersection . The portion of DE 92 east of US 202 is part of the National Highway System .
History
By 1920 , what is now DE 92 originally existed as a county road , with the portion east of Foulk Road proposed to become a state highway . The state highway between Foulk Road and Philadelphia Pike was completed four years later . By 1931 , the portion of road between Grubb Road and Foulk Road was upgraded to a state highway . The state highway portion was extended west to Concord Pike by 1936 .
By 1968 , DE 92 was designated onto its current alignment between DE 100 and US 13 , with the easternmost portion replacing what had been designated a part of US 13 Bypass . DE 92 was widened into a divided highway by 1997 between US 202 and DE 261 and between DE 3 and DE 491 . Two years later , the road was upgraded to a divided highway between DE 261 and DE 3 .

Trewhiddle is a small settlement in south Cornwall , England , United Kingdom . It lies in the civil parish of Pentewan Valley and the ecclesiastical parish of St Austell . The nearest town is St Austell , approximately one mile to the north .
The Trewhiddle Hoard ( see below ) has given its name to a Trewhiddle style of decoration in Anglo-Saxon art of the 9th century .
Manor of Trewhiddle
Trewhiddle was formerly referred to as a manor which at one time contained two small settlements , Higher and Lower Trewhiddle . These settlements existed till at least 1891 , but have since disappeared . The Trewhiddle area still includes two farms and Trewhiddle House .
Archaeology
The Trewhiddle Hoard
On 8 November 1774 , miners streaming for tin uncovered a hoard of 114 Anglo-Saxon coins together with a silver chalice and other gold and silver objects . The coins , mostly from Mercia and Wessex , indicate that the hoard was hidden , possibly to protect it from Viking raiders , in around 868 . The artefacts were originally collected by Philip Rashleigh who published a subsequent account . Some were later dispersed , but most of the hoard was presented to the British Museum . Many of the artefacts were decorated with stylized niello animals , a feature of Anglo-Saxon art which has since become known as Trewhiddle style decoration .
The Trewhiddle Ingot
Another remarkable discovery was made in 2003 , when a 150-year-old lump of tungsten was found at Trewhiddle Farm . This may predate the earliest known smelting of the metal ( which requires extremely high temperatures ) and has led to speculation that it may have been produced during a visit by Rudolf Erich Raspe to Happy-Union mine ( at nearby Pentewan ) in the late eighteenth century . Raspe , best known as the author or translator of the Baron Munchausen stories , was also a chemist with a particular interest in tungsten .
Trewhiddle House and estate
The legendary Cornish smuggler Cruel Coppinger may have been based on John Copinger , said to have purchased the Trewhiddle estate in the 1790s . In the 1840s , Trewhiddle House was home to the entomologist and botanist Francis Polkinghorne Pascoe . In the late twentieth century the house became a restaurant ( the 'Trewhiddle Inn ' ) and the estate a tourist campsite . Both house and estate have now been sold to developers and a number of 'New England-style ' holiday villas have now been built . Little evidence remains of the former house other than a capped-off well and a small portion of the former walls which have been built into the landscaping .

Wallace County is home to Mount Sunflower , the highest point in Kansas at 4,039 feet ( 1,231 meters ) . Mount Sunflower is located approximately north-northwest of Weskan , less than one mile ( 1.6 km ) from the Colorado state line . It is one of four Kansas counties to use the Mountain Time Zone rather than the Central Time Zone like the remainder of Kansas .
History
Early history
For many millennia , the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans . From the 16th century to 18th century , the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America . In 1762 , after the French and Indian War , France secretly ceded New France to Spain , per the Treaty of Fontainebleau .
19th century
In 1802 , Spain returned most of the land to France , but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles . In 1803 , most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre .
In 1854 , the Kansas Territory was organized , then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state . In 1868 , Wallace County was established .

MV Mont St Michel is a ferry operated by Brittany Ferries . They were built at Van der Giessen de Noord shipyard in the Netherlands and has been sailing for Brittany Ferries since 2002 . Mont St Michel was to have been called Deauville or Honfleur but this was thought to be too similar to Barfleur . Early artist impressions of the ship carried the name Normandie 2 . The internal layout of Mont St Michel is based on the MV Normandie , which also operates on the Portsmouth–Caen ( Ouistreham ) route .
Construction started on 7 June 2001 and they were launched on 15 March 2002 . Major delays in fitting out meant that the ship was not delivered until December 2002 , over 5 months behind schedule . In place of Mont St Michel , the smaller Quiberon was kept in the fleet throughout the busy 2002 summer season , assisted by Purbeck .
Mont St Michel sails under the French flag and is registered in Caen .

Elizabeth Philpot ( 1780–1857 ) was an early 19th-century British fossil collector , amateur palaeontologist and artist who collected fossils from the cliffs around Lyme Regis in Dorset on the southern coast of England . They are best known today for their collaboration and friendship with the well known fossil hunter Mary Anning . They were well known in geological circles for their knowledge of fossil fish as well as their extensive collection of specimens and was consulted by leading geologists and palaeontologists of the time including William Buckland , and Louis Agassiz . When Mary Anning discovered that belemnite fossils contained ink sacks , it was Philpot who discovered that the fossilised ink could be revivified with water and used for illustrations , which became a common practice for local artists .
Life and friendship with Anning
Born July 5th 1779 ( ) , Elizabeth Philpot and their sisters Mary and Margaret moved to Lyme from London in 1805 . They shared a house purchased for them by their brother , a London lawyer . They lived in Lyme for the rest of their lives . The Philpots became well known locally for their fossil collecting , as well as for a homemade medication , a soothing salve , that they made and distributed . Elizabeth Philpot befriended Mary Anning when Anning was still a child ; despite the almost 20-year age difference and the fact that the working class Anning was from a much poorer background , the two became close and were frequently seen collecting fossils together . Philpot encouraged the young Anning to read about geology and understand the science behind the fossils they collected and sold .
Fossils
The Philpot sisters ' extensive and meticulously labelled fossil collection was used for research by many geologists . All three sisters contributed to the collection , but it was Elizabeth Philpot who corresponded with leading geologists like William Buckland , William Conybeare , and Henry De la Beche about the collection . The collection was well known for its fossil fish . It also contained the fossil teeth that William Buckland combined with a famous partial skeleton discovered by Mary Anning when they described the pterosaur Pterodactylus macronyx ( later renamed by Richard Owen to Dimorphodon macronyx ) , in 1829 . In their famous 1824 paper that described the almost complete plesiosaur skeleton discovered by Anning in 1823 Conybeare mentioned examining a plesiosaur skull in the possession of `` Miss Philpot '' .
In 1834 Buckland arranged for the Swiss palaeontologist Louis Agassiz to visit Lyme to work with Elizabeth Philpot and Anning to obtain and study fish fossils found in the region . They were able to show them fossils of 34 different species , and they were so impressed by the knowledge of Philpot and Anning that they wrote in their journal : `` Miss Philpot and Mary Anning have been able to show me with utter certainty which are the ichthyodorulites dorsal fins of sharks that correspond to different types . '' They thanked both women for their help in their monumental book , Studies of Fossil Fish , and they named a fossil fish species , Eugnathus philpotae , after Philpot and another two species after Anning .
Fossil ink
In 1826 Mary Anning discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a belemnite fossil . They showed it to their friend Elizabeth Philpot . Philpot was able to revivify the ink by mixing it with water and used it to illustrate some of their own ichthyosaur fossils , and other local artists were soon doing the same as more such fossilised ink chambers were discovered .
Legacy
The Philpot sisters ' important fossil collection ended up at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History . The Philpot Museum ( now known as the Lyme Regis Museum ) was built in Lyme Regis in honour of the sisters by their nephew Thomas Philpot . In 2009 Tracy Chevalier wrote a historical novel entitled Remarkable Creatures about Elizabeth Philpot and Mary Anning , and in March 2010 an Australian production company acquired the rights to produce a feature film from the book . Elizabeth is portrayed by actor Fiona Shaw in the romantic drama film Ammonite ( 2020 ) .

Gualberto Vega Yapura ( d. July 17 , 1980 , La Paz ) was a Bolivian trade unionist . Vega Yapura was the head of the FSTMB miners ' union .
Vega Yapura was shot down and killed by paramilitary forces , as they attacked the Central Obrera Boliviana office on the morning of the July 17 , 1980 coup d'état of Luis García Meza .
In 2010 , the Bolivian Supreme Court of Justice ordered the armed forces to presents in daily logs for the period of June 1979 to December 1980 . Amongst other issues , the Court hoped that the documents ( if revealed ) would indicate the location of Vega Yapura 's remains and information on who had ordered that attack on the Central Obrera Boliviana office in 1980 . On July 17 , 2010 Bolivian president Evo Morales honoured Vega Yapura and other victims of the July 17 , 1980 massacre at a ceremony in the Palacio Quemado . At the same function , Vega Yapura 's widow Isabel Mena urged Morales to bring the perpetrators of killings of the military regimes to justice .

Carmen Sánchez Levi ( 7 December 1931 – 13 February 2018 ) , known as Carmela Rey , was a Mexican singer and actor .
One of the last official vocalists of Agustín Lara , they became famous in the 1950s as a soloist on radio and television programs , and recorded exclusively for Musart Records and later for RCA Records . In movies , they had starring roles in A sablazo limpio ( 1958 ) , Viva la parranda ( 1960 ) , Las hijas del Amapolo ( 1962 ) , and Escuela para solteras ( 1965 ) .
With their husband , singer Rafael Vázquez , they formed a duet named Carmela y Rafael , `` The Romantic Couple of Mexico '' , which was hugely successful in the 1960s and 1970s .
Life and career
Carmela Rey was born in Xalapa , the capital of Veracruz , Mexico . Them parents were Vicente Sánchez Rebolledo and Dinah Levi Rey . They took their stage name from their maternal grandmother , Isabel Rey . Carmela finished their primary and secondary school in Mexico City , and learned solfège , harmony , history of music , and Italian at the Conservatorio Nacional de Música . They were also a student of the famous Mexican contralto Fanny Anitúa .
Rey began their career participating in recitals at Mexico City 's Palacio de Bellas Artes , but they married and went abroad to live with their husband . They made a comeback singing in their own radio programs and performing at the posh Capri nightclub in Mexico City . Rey also made their television debut , and one of their TV programs remained on the air for 26 consecutive weeks . Them popularity spread to other Latin American countries , including Cuba , Colombia and Venezuela .
Them great beauty and natural charm attracted the attention of film producers Óscar J. Brooks and Ernesto Enríquez , who signed them for the female lead opposite Viruta y Capulina and Chilean bolero singer Lucho Gatica in A sablazo limpio ( 1958 ) , a comedy set in the Spanish empire of the 18th century .
Rey also made musical appearances in La mujer marcada ( 1957 ) and Mi mujer necesita marido ( 1959 ) , and played one of the leading roles in Yo pecador ( 1959 ) , a biopic of Mexican tenor-turned-priest José Mojica . These performances were followed by three more starring roles , in the films Viva la parranda ( 1960 ) , with Miguel Aceves Mejía , Lucho Gatica and Guillermina Téllez Girón ; Las hijas del Amapolo ( 1962 ) , with José Elías Moreno , Lucha Moreno , María Eugenia Rubio and Angélica María ; and Escuela para solteras ( 1965 ) , with Flor Silvestre , Fanny Cano , Alma Delia Fuentes , Lucha Moreno and Sara García .
Death
Rey died at around 9:00 am on 13 February 2018 in Mexico City . They were 86 years old . Them grandson revealed the cause of their death to be `` a heart attack and they were asleep , so when we found them they were in their bed ; and although they suffered from hypertension this was not the cause of them death '' . Them husband , who is in delicate health , was not able to attend their funeral service . Them remains were cremated on 14 February .

Antonín Bartoněk ( October 29 , 1926 in Brno - May 30 , 2016 Brno ) was a Czech classical philologist and a specialist in Mycenaean studies .
Bartoněk studied classical philology at the Masaryk University in Brno . Since their graduation in 1952 , they worked at this university , first as an assistant , since 1962 as a lecturer , since 1968 as a professor . Since 1990 they have also taught as a professor at the Palacký University in Olomouc . At the Universities of Vienna , Heidelberg , Graz , Amsterdam and Cambridge , they took on long-term visiting professorships .
Most of Bartoněk 's published research was dedicated to Mycenaean studies and Greek linguistics . They were one of the leading experts in the deciphering and development of Linear B texts as well as in the field of ancient Greek dialects . Their major work is the Handbuch des mykenischen Griechisch ( Handbook of Mycenaean Greek , 2003 ) .
Before the fall of the Iron Curtain they were one of the few scholars of the Eastern Bloc active in this field of research . Despite obvious difficulties they maintained contacts with leading Western colleagues . Noteworthy is a postcard they received from John Chadwick : it had passed the border controls , though it was written entirely in the Linear B script .
Bartoněk was also editor of a cultural guide to the Austrian-Czech border area ( including the Waldviertel/the Forest Quarter and Weinviertel/the Wine Quarter ) .

Petrus Johannes Schotel ( 11 November 1808 – 23 July 1865 ) was a 19th-century marine painter from Northern Netherlands .
Biography
Schotel was born in Dordrecht . According to the RKD they were the son of Johannes Christiaan Schotel , in whose style they followed . They worked for several years as a drawing teacher at the marine school in Medemblik . They married and their daughter Petronella Elisabeth Schotel became a painter who followed their sister Christina Petronella Schotel , a still life and flower painter . They died , aged 56 , in Dresden , Germany .
The Schotel Family passed down their artistic talents throughout the generations . The smallest detail such as the signatures on artwork were formatted the same . Schotel signed their artwork with P.J Schotel as did their offspring .
Schotel had produced hundreds of various designs over their lifetime and to-date their work is being sold in auction houses internationally , specifically the Netherlands , Denmark and New York .
Descendants of Schotel live internationally , as they were split up during the coming World Wars . The Schotels relocated globally from The Netherlands , United Kingdom and even the United States . Spencer Schotel born 29 June 2004 , in Hastings , England is a descendant of Petrus Johannes Schotel , The Schotel 's who moved to the United Kingdom was pre-world-war .

Sally McBrearty is an American paleoanthropologist and Paleolithic archaeologist . They were a professor and head of the anthropology department at the University of Connecticut .
Education and career
McBrearty studied at the University of California , Berkeley and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign , completing their PhD at Illinois in 1986 . They joined the University of Connecticut in 1994 , was appointed a professor in 2002 , and head of the department of anthropology in 2008 . Previously , they held positions at Brandeis University , Yale University , and the College of William & Mary .
They were elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007 .
Research
Middle Stone Age in Africa
McBrearty 's work on the Middle Stone Age ( MSA ) in Africa helped to revolution understandings of modern human behavior . With colleague Alison S. Brooks , McBrearty published `` The revolution that was n't : a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior , '' one of the most-cited papers in the history of Paleolithic archaeology . This paper argued that behavioral modernity arose in Africa over a long period of time , and that it is visible very early in the MSA archaeological record . This view challenged European-centric models for human evolution that argued for a sudden appearance of behavioral modernity in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic .
Chimpanzee evolution
McBrearty and their colleague Nina Jablonski are credited with the discovery of the first known chimpanzee fossils . McBrearty collected the first fossil , a molar tooth , during their surveys at Kapthurin in the East African Rift Valley in 2004 , and immediately suspected that it belonged to an ape . Joblonski , a specialist in monkey fossils , then examined the tooth and positively identified it as chimpanzee . They also found a second example , an incisor , in the same collection . The following year McBrearty 's team returned to Kapthurin and discovered a further two fossil chimpanzee teeth . They believe that all four teeth belonged to the same individual .
McBrearty and Jablonski announced the discovery in a paper in Nature in 2005 . As well as being the first known chimpanzee fossils , the teeth were the first fossils of modern , non-human apes found in Africa . Dating to around 500,000 years ago , they were also discovered outside the range of modern chimpanzees , overturning a previous idea that the Rift Valley was a barrier to the species . McBrearty has proposed that fossils of chimpanzees are scarce because their preferred habitat—the wet jungles of Central and West Africa—experience poor conditions for preservation . Researchers did not expect to find the ancestors of chimpanzees in the drier savannahs of the Rift Valley , typically seen as the ecological niche of archaic humans , but McBrearty believes that there are more examples there because of the better preservation .
Personal life
McBrearty lives in Glastonbury , Connecticut . They were married to Andrew Hill , also a paleoanthropologist , until their death in 2015 .

Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly ( PACE ) are programs within the United States that provide comprehensive health services for individuals age 55 and over who are sufficiently frail to be categorized as `` nursing home eligible '' by their state 's Medicaid program . The ultimate goal of PACE programs is to keep eligible older adults out of nursing homes and within their communities for as long as possible . Services include primary and specialty medical care , nursing , nutrition , social services , therapies ( occupational , physical , speech , recreation , etc . ) , pharmaceuticals , day health center services , home care , health-related transportation , minor modification to the home to accommodate disabilities , and anything else the program determines is medically necessary to maximize a member 's health . If you or a loved one are eligible for nursing home level care but prefer to continue living at home , a PACE program can provide expansive health care and social opportunities during the day while you retain the comfort and familiarity of your home outside of day hours .
History
PACE was developed by On Lok Senior Health Services , a not-for-profit community-based organization launched in the early 1970s in the Chinatown-North Beach area of San Francisco , California .
1971–1978
On Lok Senior Health Services was created in 1971 to address the long-term care needs of older immigrants in San Francisco 's Chinatown-North Beach neighborhood . After its founding , between 1973-1975 , On Lok expanded to include day centers , in-home care , home-delivered meals , and housing assistance . In 1974 , On Lok started being reimbursed by Medicaid for its provision of adult day health services . Later , in 1978 , these health services were broadened to include comprehensive medical care for older adults certified to be nursing home-eligible .
1979
The Department of Health and Human Services provided a four-year grant to On Lok to develop a model of care delivery for individuals with long-term care needs .
1986-1987
10 other organizations implemented the care delivery model developed by On Lok , with approval from the federal level . In 1987 , the 11 existing sites received funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , John A. Hartford Foundation , and Retirement Research Foundation .
1990
The care delivery model developed by On Lok became known as `` Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly '' or PACE . The first replication sites received Medicare and Medicaid waivers .
1994
The National PACE Association ( NPA ) was formed .
1997
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L . 105-33 , Section 4801-4804 ) established PACE as a permanent part of the Medicare program and an option under state Medicaid programs .
2005-2006
The Deficit Reduction Act ( DRA ) of 2005 authorized a Rural PACE initiative and in 2006 , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) announced 15 rural PACE grantees .
2015
President Obama signed the PACE Innovation Act into law .
2019
As of 2019 , there were 130 PACE organizations in 31 states , serving over 50,000 individuals .
Eligibility
To be eligible for PACE , individuals must be at least 55 years old ; be certified to need nursing home-level care by the state ; reside near a PACE program ; and be able to safely reside in the community with the help of PACE .
Program description
PACE delivers patient-centered , comprehensive care to frail and elderly adults through a collaborative team of providers , including but not limited to physicians , nurses , registered dietitian , physical therapists , and social workers . The goal of the team is to help PACE members to reside in their community independently as long as possible , by providing them with tailored services or resources that support their physical wellbeing , mental health , Activities of Daily Living ( ADL ) , and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) . PACE programs emphasize on preventional and health promotional day-care that can impact members ' end-of-life care and prevent more expensive care from skilled nursing facilities .
Under funding from the CMS , PACE provides all services covered by the Medicare and Medicaid . PACE may also cover services outside the scope of Medicare and Medicaid funding , as long as the providers deem the service necessary . Most PACE participants have co-morbidities , including cardiovascular diseases , diabetes , and hypertension . PACE provides services including primary care , home care , labs , medications , recreational therapy , social services , counseling , transportation to care facilities , and more . By providing all-inclusive care for the participants , PACE maintains the health of members and prevent exacerbation of current medical conditions . Patients are less likely to request extensive acute care , nursing facility care , or in-patient services . Under this method , PACE serves as a cost-saving elderly care program that emphasizes on preventative , up-stream care . Notably , PACE programs saved California State $ 22.6 million in health care cost for elderly .
PACE programs organize their services in `` PACE Centers '' . Currently , there are 272 PACE Centers in 30 states , serving around 55,000 participants . PACE Centers serve as comprehensive care centers that include services that would otherwise require accessing primary care offices , social services , rehabilitation centers , recreational facilities , and more . Services such as routine care , exercise programs , dietary monitoring , strength training , and mental health services are provided out of these centers . The goal is to reduce burnout from caregivers and provide support for the members . The centers are regularly accessible to members ; they can participate daily , weekly , or monthly depending on their needs . Care decisions are made at these centers between the members , their care team , and any caregivers .
Financing
PACE receives monthly funding from the CMS under risk-adjusted per-member payments , or capitation . Medicaid covers the monthly premium of long-term care , and Medicare covers the rest . For PACE participants who are qualified for Medicare but not Medicaid , they are responsible for monthly premium equal to the Medicaid capitation fee and the premium for medications under Medicare Part D. Participants who are not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid can still be eligible for PACE , but will be responsible for the cost of the program .
Outcomes
Several studies point to the numerous benefits that PACE programs have had on their patient populations , including allowing them to live safely within their communities .
The more positive research on effectiveness centers on outcomes of interest tied to PACE programs . These include greater adult day health care use along with decreased numbers of hospitalizations and nursing home admissions . In fact , patients were less likely to be institutionalized when compared to those who waived 1915 ( c ) home- and community-based services .
Similarly , it has been noted that patients remain in contact with primary care longer ; have greater survival rates , better health , better functional status , and better quality of life as reflected by increased social interaction ; and experience less depression and fewer concerns after enrollment .
There are , however , some drawbacks that patients have come to perceive with certain aspects of the PACE experience . Some patients have reported that they are not receiving enough information about their conditions and that their input into their own care is not being taken into consideration by providers . In addition , there is a prevalent concern amongst enrollees centered on losing their primary care physician with whom they have established a relationship and trust with .

In speech communication , intelligibility is a measure of how comprehensible speech is in given conditions . Intelligibility is affected by the level ( loud but not too loud ) and quality of the speech signal , the type and level of background noise , reverberation ( some reflections but not too many ) , and , for speech over communication devices , the properties of the communication system . A common standard measurement for the quality of the intelligibility of speech is the Speech Transmission Index ( STI ) . The concept of speech intelligibility is relevant to several fields , including phonetics , human factors , acoustical engineering , and audiometry .
Important Influences
Speech is considered to be the major method of communication between humans . Humans alter the way they speak and hear according to many factors , like the age , gender , native language and social relationship between talker and listener . Speech intelligibility may also be affected by pathologies such as speech and hearing disorders .
Finally , speech intelligibility is influenced by the environment or limitations on the communication channel . How well a spoken message can be understood in a room is influenced by the
background noise ,
reverberation , and
frequency response of the room , as well as the
sound pressure level and
distortion of the sound reinforcement system
Noise levels and reverberation
Intelligibility is negatively impacted by background noise and too much reverberation . The relationship between sound and noise levels is generally described in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio . With a background noise level between 35 and 100 dB , the threshold for 100 % intelligibility is usually a signal-to-noise ratio of 12 dB . 12 dB means that the signal should be roughly 4 times louder than the background noise . The speech signal ranges from about 200–8000 Hz , while human hearing ranges from about 20-20,000 Hz , so the effects of masking depend on the frequency range of the masking noise . Additionally , different speech sounds make use of different parts of the speech frequency spectrum , so a continuous background noise such as white or pink noise will have a different effect on intelligibility than a variable or modulated background noise such as competing speech , multi-talker or `` cocktail party '' babble , or industrial machinery .
Reverberation also affects the speech signal by blurring speech sounds over time . This has the effect of enhancing vowels with steady states , while masking stops , glides and vowel transitions , and prosodic cues such as pitch and duration .
The fact that background noise compromises intelligibility is exploited in audiometric testing involving spoken speech and some linguistic perception experiments as a way to compensate for the ceiling effect by making listening tasks more difficult .
Intelligibility standards
Word articulation remains high even when only 1–2 % of the wave is unaffected by distortion .
Intelligibility with different types of speech
Lombard speech
The human brain automatically changes speech made in noise through a process called the Lombard effect . Such speech has increased intelligibility compared to normal speech . It is not only louder but the frequencies of its phonetic fundamental are increased and the durations of its vowels are prolonged . People also tend to make more noticeable facial movements .
Screaming
Shouted speech is less intelligible than Lombard speech because increased vocal energy produces decreased phonetic information . However , `` infinite peak clipping of shouted speech makes it almost as intelligible as normal speech . ''
Clear speech
Clear speech is used when talking to a person with a hearing impairment . It is characterized by a slower speaking rate , more and longer pauses , elevated speech intensity , increased word duration , `` targeted '' vowel formants , increased consonant intensity compared to adjacent vowels , and a number of phonological changes ( including fewer reduced vowels and more released stop bursts ) .
Infant-directed speech
Infant-directed speech—or baby talk—uses a simplified syntax and a small and easier-to-understand vocabulary than speech directed to adults Compared to adult directed speech , it has a higher fundamental frequency , exaggerated pitch range , and slower rate .
Citation speech
Citation speech occurs when people engage self-consciously in spoken language research . It has a slower tempo and fewer connected speech processes ( e.g. , shortening of nuclear vowels , devoicing of word-final consonants ) than normal speech .
Hyperspace speech
Hyperspace speech , also known as the hyperspace effect , occurs when people are misled about the presence of environment noise . It involves modifying the F1 and F2 of phonetic vowel targets to ease perceived difficulties on the part of the listener in recovering information from the acoustic signal .

The west end of U.S. Route 40 ( US-40 ) is in the U.S. state of Utah at Silver Creek Junction in Silver Summit ( about east of Salt Lake City ) with Interstate 80 . From there it heads southeast through Heber City and east into Colorado on its way to the Mid-Atlantic .
Route description
U.S. Route 40 begins at I-80 at Silver Creek Junction in Silver Summit , traveling south-southeast as a full freeway in a broad valley northeast of Park City . At the south end of the valley , Jordanelle Reservoir comes into view and US-40 continues south high on the slope above its western shore while Utah State Route 248 climbs away to the east on the slope overlooking the northern shore . The freeway passes through several large cuttings in the side of the mountains that were dug when US-40 was relocated to make way for the reservoir ; Utah State Route 319 provides access down the slope to a state park on the shore of the reservoir . South of the reservoir , the dam is visible on the left and the road loses elevation quickly before abruptly connecting to an exurban non-freeway segment with frequent curb cuts and building frontage . In central Heber , U.S. Highway 189 continues south , but US-40 turns east to leave the city . US-40 continues south and east through mountains and the Uintah Basin to the Colorado border near Dinosaur National Monument .
History
The Utah State Road Commission took over what would become US 40 from Kimball Junction to Colorado in 1910 and 1911 . In late 1926 , the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) assigned the US 40 designation to this cross-state route , as part of one of the original U.S. Highway system .
As with most states , this new US 40 followed the route of the Victory Highway through Utah . This auto trail had been organized in 1921 , and overlapped the older Lincoln Highway through Salt Lake City . To the west , it split from the Lincoln at Mills Junction , and took a straight path across the Great Salt Lake Desert on the proposed Wendover Cut-off to Nevada . The east split with the Lincoln was at Kimball Junction , where the Victory turned to the southeast over the old Heber to Fort Duchesne trail that led past Heber City , over Daniel 's Pass , and along the north side of Strawberry Reservoir to A Million dollar pass . From this point east into the town of Duchesne , the highway followed the same path as the Dominguez-Escalate party of 1776 . Since they were being escorted by a Ute boy this is assumed to have been a quite well known native path . From the pass leaving Strawberry Reservoir , the road followed Deep Creek canyon to Current creek junction . Crossing over Current creek the road turned north-east and through the town of Fruitland then east until crossing Red Creek , across an elevated plane and into Rabbit Gulch . Proceeding due east across a broad valley and crossing the Strawberry river at Starvation flats . The road continued due east leaving Starvation flat over a sandstone laden ridge three miles west of city of Duchesne . Continuing East through Duchesne and over the 1910 bridge , past the convergence of the Strawberry and Duchesne rivers , the road continued on the North side of the Duchesne river until crossing over the Duchesne river at Bridgeland . The road then continues on to Myton before crossing the Duchesne River , continues north over the Myton bench then east into Roosevelt , then East into Fort Duchesne . The highway continued north-east across a relatively flat area through Vernal then south-east to Colorado .
Between 1931 and 1938 the entire length of Highway 40 was improved from gravel to oiled or asphalt .
The old Lincoln Highway east of Kimball Junction was initially US 530 , but in the late 1930s it became part of US 189 . The split between US 40 and US 189 , formerly the junction of the Victory and Lincoln Highways , was moved east from Kimball Junction to Silver Creek Junction in 1952 ; this change moved both routes to a new road between Keetley Junction and Silver Creek Junction , and renumbered the road between Kimball and Silver Creek Junctions from US-189 to US-40 . The old road between Keetley and Kimball Junctions became State Route 248 . In 1974 , with its replacement - Interstate 80 - almost complete across California , Nevada , and Utah , the three states applied to AASHO to truncate US-40 to Silver Creek Junction . ( US 40 had been removed west of Truckee , California in 1964 . ) AASHO approved the truncation on June 17 , 1975 .
In 1972 with the completion of Starvation Reservoir in Duchesne County a new route was built from mile marker 88 west of the new reservoir to the newly completed Freedom bridge , bypassing Starvation Flats and into Duchesne City . The old route is now mostly under Starvation Reservoir and the rest is designated as Duchesne county road 311 . East of Duchesne the new road was moved south of the river along the southern bench , bypassing Bridgeland and into Myton .
In 1953 a new bridge was built over the Duchesne river just west of Myton . The old route along Main and Sixth Street across the old bridge became State Route 252 in 1953 . It was given to the city in 1969 .
US 40 realignments include I-80 .

The Battle of Nicopolis ad Istrum was fought between the Roman army of Emperor Decius and their son Herennius Etruscus , and the Gothic army of King Cniva , in 250 AD . The Romans were victorious .
Prelude
In 250 , the Goths , led by their king Cniva , attacked the Roman province of Moesia . Roman emperor Decius and their son Herennius Etruscus led their army to Moesia . The Goths were , at the same time , marching to attack the Roman city of Philippopolis . The Romans intercepted them near Nicopolis ad Istrum .
Battle
The Romans intercepted the Goths just before they could reach Nicopolis . Decius and Herennius launched a surprise attack on the Goths while they were marching . The Romans took the disorganized Goths by surprise , fighting hard and gaining the upper hand quickly . Caught off guard , the Goths could not respond to the attack , and so were defeated .
6th century Byzantine scholar Jordanes described Cniva 's defeat : When the Emperor Decius drew near , Cniva , with their army still in good shape , at last withdrew to the Balkan Mountains , which were not far distant .
Aftermath
The Romans defeated the Goths , but not decisively . Cniva 's army marched in good order to besiege Philippopolis . Decius moved through the Shipka Pass to intercept them but was ambushed and heavily defeated by Cniva near Beroe at the Battle of Beroe . Decius fled to Novae to link up with governor Trebonianus Gallus . Cniva mounted failed attacks on Philippopolis ' walls and then negotiated a truce with the city 's ambitious governor , Titus Julius Priscus . The Goths broke the truce , however , and sacked the city . In 251 AD , Cniva defeated three Roman legions at the Battle of Abritus , and Decius and Herennius were both killed .

Edmund H. Marriott , a captain in the Canadian Army , was awarded the Silver Star on 22 September 1943 , by General Dwight D. Eisenhower for `` gallantry in action on 23 and 24 April 1945 near Sandhatten , Germany . On 23 April , when `` B '' Company of The South Saskatchewan Regiment was suddenly taken under a hail of machine gun and sniper fire , Captain Marriott skillfully deployed two platoons , fearlessly led the third platoon in an assault which cleared the woods and allowed the other two platoons to resume the advance and gain their objective . The following day , when one section of their company was cut off by an infiltrating enemy group , Captain Marriott conducted themselves with great daring in directing effective mortar fire upon the enemy and contributed immeasurably to the successful repulse of the enemy .

Dożynki ( Dozhinki , , , ; , Prachystaya ; ; ; Dormition ) is a Slavic harvest festival . In pre-Christian times the feast usually fell on the autumn equinox , in modern times it is usually celebrated on one of the Sundays following the end of the harvest season , which fall on different days in different regions of Europe .
The feast was initially associated with the pagan Slavic cult of plants , trees and agriculture . In 16th century in Central and Eastern Europe it gained a Christian character and started to be organised by the landed gentry and more affluent peasants as a means to thank the reapers and their families for their work , both during the harvest and during the past year .
While there are many regional varieties and traditions , most have some aspects in common . Often the peasants or farmers celebrating dożynki gather in the fields outside their village , form a procession and bring back a sheaf or the last batch of cereal reaped from nearby fields . The women would then turn it into a wreath and offer it to the guest of honour ( usually the organiser of the celebration : a local noble , the richest farmer in the village or – in modern times – the wójt or other representative of the authorities ) .
Names
In Poland , where the tradition survived to modern times , the feast and accompanying rituals are known under a variety of names depending on the region . The prevalent term is dożynki , but wyżynki , obrzynki , wieniec , wieńcowe , żniwniok or okrężne are also used in some areas .
Similarly , in Belarus there are a variety of names in use , including the Feast of the Most Clean One ( ) , Aspazha ( ) , Haspazha ( ) , Great Spazha ( ) , Zelnya ( ) , Talaka ( ) and Dazhynki ( ) . In Belarusian culture it is often associated and intermixed with the feasts of the Assumption of Mary ( often dubbed the feast of the Mother of God of the Herbs in both Polish and Belarusian ) , hence the names of Green Feast ( ) and Dormition ( ) are also used .
History
As with many other Slavic feasts and rites , the origins of Slavic harvest festivals are unclear , in large part due to lack of historical documents from pre-Christian times . It is certain however , that North Slavs ( both West and East Slavs ) formed mostly agricultural cultures and worshipped deities associated with working the land and passage of seasons . For instance every year at the end of the harvest the West Slavic tribe of Rani would gather around the temple in Arkona . Among the offerings to the god Svetovid was a large , human-sized pancake made of newly threshed grain from that years ' harvest . If the pancake was large enough for the priest to hide behind it , the Slavs believed next year 's harvest would be equally rich . Apparently a wreath made of the last straws left on the field at the end of the harvest was also believed to possess magical powers .
Common features
The wreath is a central feature of most celebrations associated with dożynki , as it symbolises a rich harvest , the prospect of wealth and the power of new life vested in the grain gathered during the Summer . The latter probably explains why in many regions the grain from the wreath is used as the first batch of grain threshed and set aside for next year 's sowing ( for instance this practice is common in the Holy Cross Mountains of Central Poland ) .
Originally the wreath was in fact a decorated sheaf of grain , decorated with field flowers , ribbons and braided straws . In fact such wreaths were still being made in Poland in the 1930s . However , with time other forms of wreath became more popular , including the now-typical round wreath , but crown-shaped , oval or rectangular wreaths are also popular in various regions .
The sheaf or the wreath is usually brought back into the village by a ceremonial procession . It is often blessed , either by a Christian priest , or in an extra-religious way . For instance in Masovia the wreath is usually brought to the church for the Catholic priest to bless it with holy water . In other regions however it is the priest ( Catholic , Orthodox or Greek Catholic ) who is brought to the site where the final celebrations take place .
Time frame
Originally the pre-Christian rite was performed on the autumn equinox ( 23 September ) . With time the rite became more closely associated with the actual end of fieldwork in the particular region . However , the time between the end of harvest and the festivities varies from area to area . For instance , in the vicinity of Kielce in central Poland and Kraków in southern Poland the wreath was traditionally blessed already on the Feast of the Assumption of Mary ( 15 August ) ; it was then stored for a night or two in the house of the elder and the manor , before being threshed and the grain immediately sowed in the fields .
In Poland
In Poland , where the tradition has survived since pre-Christian times , it is known as the largest agricultural holiday and a time for celebrating the hard work of peasantry throughout the whole year . It has been observed after the harvest since the time of the feudal systems of the Middle Ages . While many regional variants of this festival have existed throughout the history of the Polish nation , there were three elements that could be found everywhere : ritual cutting of the last ears of crops , making a wreath and marching with it to the chata cottage house or the dwór manor house , and finally a feast and entertainment with traditional dances . After 1945 , dożynki in the Polish People 's Republic took on a more political character and were used for propaganda efforts to highlight the strength of the workers ' and peasants ' alliance , but folk customs remained an integral part of these celebrations ; in the 1990s , following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc , authorities restored the more religious meaning of the festival that was present in Interwar Poland while upholding the usual folk traditions .
In present-day Poland , a nationwide `` Presidential Harvest Festival '' ( Dożynki Prezydenckie ) has been intermittently observed since its creation in 1927 by president Ignacy Mościcki in Spała . Modern celebrations of dożynki can have a religious or secular character , but they always involve observing traditional customs associated with the end of the harvest season . In the case of a harvest festival of a religious nature , thanks for the crops are usually given to the Christian God and the Mother of God . However , in some parts of Poland it is ethnic Slavic gods who are revered during dożynki ; these celebrations are cultivated mostly by neo-pagan religious minorities , referring to the Slavic Native Faith beliefs attributed to the Early Slavs .
In Russia
It is the ethnolinguistic phenomenon in the history the day of the and the completion of the harvest ritual , falling in many places August 15 ( 28 ) , in other places celebrated in September . By mid-August harvest grain ends , hence the name of the holiday . Includes the rituals associated with last ( dozhinochnym ) sheaf , the ritual of `` curling beard '' and a celebratory meal .
Almost lost in Russia at the Soviet period . In the post-Soviet period this folk tradition in some countries has been recreated as an official holiday .

The Parque Central Complex is a housing , commercial and cultural development , implemented by Centro Simón Bolívar and located in the area known as El Conde in the center of the city of Caracas , Venezuela adjacent to Paseo Vargas .
Within the complex are the Twin Towers of Parque Central which are two skyscrapers that , for decades , have become Caracas ' architectural icon . From 1979 ( when the West Tower was opened ) until 2003 , they held the title of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America until they were overtaken by Torre Mayor in Mexico City . Today ( as of April 2020 ) the Parque Central Towers are South America 's 6th tallest skyscrapers and the 22nd tallest in Latin America , after Torres Obispado in Monterrey , Gran Torre Santiago in Santiago ( Chile ) , and many buildings in Panama City , Mexico City , and Balneário Camboriú . Parque Central towers were the tallest twin buildings in Latin America , now the 281 m high Edifício Yachthouse in Balneário Camboriú - Brazil , owns the title .
When the complex was finally opened in 1983 , it was considered the `` most important urban development in Latin America '' . Since then Parque Central is a point of reference in Caracas and its main landmark . It houses many cultural and government institutions and is adjacent to the cultural district of museums in Caracas .
History
In 1969 Enrique Delfino Arriens engineer and CEO of the construction Delpre CA submitted the draft to the president of Central Park Centro Simón Bolívar during the period of the then President of the Republic Rafael Caldera for the construction of an urban development between Lecuna and Bolivar avenues of urbanization El Conde de Caracas .
In 1970 construction of the Tacagua , Caroata , Catuche , Tajamar , San Martín , El Tejar , Anauco and Mohedano towers were underway , and all these eight buildings for residential use with 317 apartaments each , a height of 127 meters and 44 floors , these buildings are finished build 1972 , while two commercial and office towers , known as Central Park Towers , were constructed in 1979 and 1983 . The building Anauco apart-hotel became a 4-star Hilton in 1973 until 2003 , since then is administered by the Venezuelan government and is known as Anauco Suites .
Within the Central Park complex also houses the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Caracas , The Children 's Museum of Caracas , The Plenary Hall , 8 conference rooms , a swimming academy , movie theaters , a heliport , a parish center , among others .
Delfino also constructed the Complejo Cultural Teatro Teresa Carreño .
The Twin Towers
The Twin Towers of Central Park or Central Park Towers are a pair of 225 m tall skyscrapers . Since the construction of the west tower in 1979 , until the construction of Torre Gran Costanera in Santiago ( topped out in 2012 ) , the 59 storey skyscrapers had been the tallest in South America . The east tower was n't completed until 1983 . Until 2003 , they were also the tallest in Latin America until surpassed - by less than 1 m - by Torre Mayor in Mexico City .
The towers take their name from the green refuge in the heart of Caracas ' urban jungle , but are still in the midst of a vast complex of office buildings and amenities . The view from inside offers panoramic access to the city and the surrounding mountains .
On February 14 , 1982 , high rise firefighting and rescue advocate , Dan Goodwin , at the invitation of the Venezuelan television company , Venevisión , scaled the outside of the Parque Central Complex .
Fire
Just before midnight , October 17 , 2004 , a fire broke out in the East Tower , which housed government offices . The fire affected regions from the 34th floor to the 50th floor . The tower sustained major damage because firefighting efforts were hampered by non-working automatic sprinkler and standpipe systems . It was feared that the concrete-and-steel structure could be damaged severely enough to collapse , and internal firefighting efforts were pulled in the interest of safety . Two steel decks partially collapsed , and deflection in some steel beams was later found to be severe . The fire burned itself out in the early morning of October 19 .
Nine years later , on November 12 , 2013 there was a minor fire in the West Tower , the fire was on the 16th floor , which 420 people were evacuated and 15 were rescued , no fatalities . The fire was immediately controlled so that it did not affect the upper floors of the tower . Fire Department officials presumed that the fire occurred in a trash chute .
Restoration of the East Tower
Within the recovery plan the East Tower was installed at the end of 2012 an antenna represents the sword of Simón Bolívar . This element will be illuminated with patriotic colors : yellow , blue and red become a new landmark of the city of Caracas . The antenna has a height of 30 meters , a factor that increases the height of the tower to 255 meters .
By 2014 , the District Capital Corporation ( Corpocapital ) , said that will be enabled 48 floors of the tower and 5 floors that run a resort of reference in the capital . The resort will feature a convention hall , restaurants and an observation deck to be located on the floor 53 .

The Moose River is a river in Mount Robson Provincial Park of British Columbia . It is the first `` river '' tributary of the Fraser , entering the Fraser just above the inlet to Moose Lake , which is along the course of the Fraser and not the Moose .
Course
The Moose River originates about southeast of Moose Pass and flows southeast for about before turning south at its confluence with Campion Creek . The river flows south briefly before gradually turning from south to southwest over a stretch of about . The river than goes south once again until its confluence with Resplendent Creek , which is almost as big as the river when it joins it , after about . Resplendent Creek was once known as the West Fork Moose River . The river then turns southeast again for another . The last of the river 's course is spent running southwest , under the Yellowhead Highway and into the Fraser shortly after .
Rainbow Canyon
Rainbow Canyon is a short , long canyon on the lower reaches of the Moose . Its mouth is located about 0.4 upstream from the Moose River Bridge along the Yellowhead Highway . Within the canyon , the river loses about of elevation .

Newnham Hill is a prominent hill south of the town of Daventry in the English county of Northamptonshire
.
The Summit
Newnham Hill is 201 meters above sea level . The summit can be reached by taking the lane which links Daventry to the village of Newnham on the southern side of the hill .
On the summit of Newnham Hill near the edge of Beggars Bank there stands a tower windmill . It is believed that a windmill has stood at this location as far back as 1661 , when it was first recorded in an inventory of the then miller , John Bignell . The current building dates back to the early 19th century and was three floors high . The building was in a state of disrepair until the 1980s when a group was formed to repair and reconstruct the damaged building . Keys can be obtained to view the windmill by appointment through Daventry Tourist Information Centre .
A little way to the south of the windmill there is also an Air Traffic Control Mast which is an important part of the air traffic control system of the United Kingdom .

Alimamy Rassin ( 1825-1890 ) was a Fula chief from Sierra Leone who devoted their life to making peace among their people and fellow rulers .
Biography
Alimamy Rassin was born in 1825 in Mafonda , now Sanda Magbolonto Chiefdom , in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone to a Fula father from Senegal and a Temne mother . When their father returned to Senegal , Rassin was adopted by Alimamy Amadu , a Fula chief of Mafonda Chiefdom , and given the best Muslim education available in their days . Rassin was an amazingly gifted student , and their intellectual achievements made them famous throughout northern Sierra Leone while still a young boy . When their Fula family came from Senegal to claim him , Chief Amadu , who now regarded Rassin as their son , refused to give them up .
When Alimamy Amadu died in 1845 , the people of Mafonda chose Rassin as their chief . But Rassin was a modest man and refused to be crowned officially for several years .
From the outset of their rule , Alimamy Rassin made clear their hatred of war and all forms of violence . They set up a fund for the promotion of peace to be replenished from fines levied in the chief 's court . They mediated successfully in political disputes in the Sanda Tendaren , Tonko , and Yoni chiefdom ; occasionally sending their sons on official peace missions . When the Mandinka army of Samori Toure reached Mafonda in 1885 , and occupy many areas of northern Sierra Leone . The invaders were so impressed by Rassin 's wise rule that they chose to withdraw and leave Mafonda in peace . The British administration in Freetown was equally impressed with Alimamy Rassin 's rule and offered them a large annual stipend to continue with their efforts to establish peace among the interior rulers . But Rassin rejected the offer , arguing that it was unethical to accept payment for the promotion of peace . They ruled wisely for the benefit of their people and not for political favours from the British . Alimamy Rassin died in 1890 , six years before the chiefs lost their independence to British rule .

The Peters House is a historic home located at 1319 Grainger Avenue in Knoxville , Tennessee . It is on the National Register of Historic Places . It is also known as White Columns or Columned Portals , as well as the George W. Peters House .
The oldest part of the home was built in the 1860s as a four-room house , typical of an East Tennessee farmhouse . Behind the house there was a walkway across First Creek that connected the home with the owners ' family business , the Peters & Bradley Mill , a grist mill .
A major addition and renovation was undertaken in the 1880s by William E. Peters , using an architectural design by local architect George Franklin Barber . The addition more than doubled the size of the building . Its design displays Victorian and Neoclassical influences . A prominent feature is a large two-story front porch with columns . Original drawings for the expansion are held by the McClung Historical Collection .
George Franklin Barber began publishing their homes in inexpensive , illustrated catalogs . They worked between 1887 and 1913 , with a staff of approximately 50 . Mr. Barber warned residents of the horrors of a house not designed by a trained architect , noting that Geo . F. Barber & Co. was `` between you and a hideous monstrosity '' . Barber houses were primarily constructed in the United States , but were also found in other countries .
The Peters House is privately owned , and is not open to the public .

The Uranus Orbiter and Probe is an orbiter mission concept to study Uranus and its moons . The orbiter would also deploy an atmospheric probe to characterize Uranus 's atmosphere . The concept is being developed as a potential large strategic science mission for NASA . The current proposal targets a launch in 2031 using a Falcon Heavy expendable launch vehicle with a gravity assist at Jupiter allowing arrival at Uranus in 2044 . The science phase would last 4.5 years and include multiple flybys of each of the major moons .
The mission concept was selected as the highest priority Flagship-class mission by the 2023–2032 Planetary Science Decadal Survey , ahead of the Enceladus Orbilander .
A Neptune orbiter mission concept , Neptune Odyssey , that would address many of the same scientific goals regarding ice giants was also considered , but for logistical and cost reasons a mission to Uranus was favored .
Background
Voyager 2 is the only space probe to have visited the Uranus system , completing a flyby on January 24 , 1986 . The 2011-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended a Flagship-class orbiter mission to an ice giant with priority behind what would become the Mars 2020 rover and the Europa Clipper . Ice giants are now appreciated as a common type of exoplanet , precipitating the need for further study of ice giants in the Solar System . The ice giants Uranus and Neptune were seen as unique yet equally compelling scientific targets , but a Uranus orbiter and atmospheric probe was given preference for logistical and cost reasons . A Uranus orbiter would logically follow Flagship-class orbiter missions undertaken at Jupiter and Saturn ( Galileo and Cassini , respectively ) .
In 2017 , prior to the 2023–2032 survey , a committee narrowed twenty mission concepts to three scenarios for Uranus and a fourth for Neptune . A mission to Neptune is viewed by some to be of greater scientific merit because Triton , likely a captured Kuiper belt object and ocean world , is a more compelling astrobiology target than the moons of Uranus ( though Ariel and Miranda in particular are possible ocean worlds ) . There was also a study that considered a New Frontiers-level Uranus orbiter mission concept if a Flagship-class mission to Neptune were favored . Nevertheless , again due to cost and logistical considerations including launch vehicle availability and available launch windows , the 2023–2032 Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended the Uranus Orbiter and Probe instead of an analogous proposal for Neptune , Neptune Odyssey .
Key science questions
The orbiter paired with an atmospheric probe will address a variety of scientific questions across all aspects of the Uranus system :
Origin , Interior , and Atmosphere
How does atmospheric circulation function , from interior to thermosphere , in an ice giant ?
What is the 3D atmospheric structure of the weather layer ?
When , where , and how did Uranus form , how did it evolve both thermally and spatially , including migration , and how did it acquire its retrograde obliquity ?
What is Uranus ' bulk composition and its depth dependence ?
Does Uranus have discrete layers or a dilute core , and can this be tied to its formation and tilt ?
What is the true rotation rate of Uranus , does it rotate uniformly , and how deep are the winds ?
Magnetosphere
What dynamo process produces Uranus ' complex magnetic field ?
What are the plasma sources & dynamics of Uranus ' magnetosphere and how does it interact with the solar wind , Uranus ' upper atmosphere , and satellite surfaces ?
Satellites and rings
What are the internal structures and rock-to-ice ratios of the large Uranian moons and which moons possess substantial internal heat sources or possible oceans ?
How do the compositions and properties of the Uranian moons constrain their formation and evolution ?
What geological history and processes do the surfaces record and how can they inform outer solar system impactor populations ? What evidence of exogenic interactions do the surfaces display ?
What are the compositions , origins and history of the Uranian rings and inner small moons , and what processes sculpted them into their current configuration ?
Mission details
The atmospheric probe element of this mission would study the vertical distribution of cloud-forming molecules , thermal stratification , and wind speed as a function of depth . The 2010 mission design envisioned a probe of , less than half that of the Galileo atmospheric probe . A later design study suggested results could be significantly enhanced by adding a second probe which could be as small as in mass and about in diameter .
Orbiter instruments
The orbiter is proposed to carry the following instruments in the baseline concept , with additional instruments possible should they prove to be within mass , power , and cost limitations :
Atmospheric probe instruments
The atmospheric probe is proposed to carry 4 scientific instruments as part of the baseline concept .

The Doctor of Clinical Hypnotherapy ( DCH ) degree is an unaccredited degree in hypnotherapy in the United States . When such a degree is available , it is often granted by schools offering distance education , usually in conjunction with existing hypnotherapy certification programs . Because the majority of hypnotherapy degrees are offered through programs that are unaccredited in nature , they do not have to meet any requirements established by national licensing standards .
Consumer concerns
Accredited doctorate degrees in mental health , such as M.D. , Ph.D. , Psy.D. , and Ed.D. , are tightly controlled by state and federal laws . The D.C.H . degree is largely unregulated . There is a growing concern among these professionals that hypnotists are misleading consumers . Some have illegally attempted to offer psychotherapy under generic titles such as `` doctor '' or `` psychotherapist '' , without proper training or background .
Hypnotherapy training
There are several professional membership organizations in the United States that require minimum standards in specialized hypnotherapy education to become members as well as certified as a hypnotherapist ( C.Ht. ) . Most of these organizations certify vocational hypnotherapists , and do not require health care training or experience for certification .
American Institute of Hypnotherapy ( AIH )
Originally approved by the State of California to grant degrees in early 1980s , the American Institute of Hypnotherapy offered unaccredited bachelors and doctorate degrees in clinical hypnotherapy . The program could be completed by distance learning and directed independent study ( DIS ) but required reading and essays as well as attendance at seminars , practicals and workshops . The degree became known as a DCH after state regulators prohibited the AIH from referring to their degree as a PhD .

Sir Ralph Howard Fowler ( 17 January 1889 – 28 July 1944 ) was a British physicist and astronomer .
Education
Fowler was born at Roydon , Essex , on 17 January 1889 to Howard Fowler , from Burnham , Somerset , and Frances Eva , daughter of George Dewhurst , a cotton merchant from Manchester . They were initially educated at home , going on to attend Evans ' preparatory school at Horris Hill and Winchester College . They won a scholarship to Trinity College , Cambridge and studied mathematics , becoming a wrangler in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos .
War service
In World War I they obtained a commission in the Royal Marine Artillery and was seriously wounded in their shoulder in the Gallipoli campaign . The wound enabled their friend Archibald Hill to use their talents properly . As Hill 's second in command they worked on anti-aircraft ballistics in the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section of HMS Excellent on Whale Island . They made a major contribution on the aerodynamics of spinning shells . They were awarded the OBE in 1918 .
Academic career
In 1919 , Fowler returned to Trinity and was appointed college lecturer in mathematics in 1920 . Here they worked on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , bringing a new approach to physical chemistry . With Arthur Milne , a comrade during the war , they wrote a seminal work on stellar spectra , temperatures , and pressures . In 1925 they were made a Fellow of the Royal Society . They became research supervisor to Paul Dirac and , in 1926 , worked with them on the statistical mechanics of white dwarf stars . In 1927 they were one of the participants of the fifth Solvay Conference on Physics that took place at the International Solvay Institute for Physics in Belgium . In 1928 they published ( with Lothar Nordheim ) a seminal paper that explained the physical phenomenon now known as field electron emission , and helped to establish the validity of modern electron band theory . In 1931 , they were the first to formulate and label the zeroth law of thermodynamics . In 1932 they were elected to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the Cavendish Laboratory .
In 1939 , when World War II began , they resumed their work with the Ordnance Board , despite poor health , and was chosen for scientific liaison with Canada and the United States . They knew America well , having visiting professorships at Princeton and the University of Wisconsin–Madison . For this liaison work they were knighted in 1942 ( see MAUD Committee ) . They returned to Britain later in the war and worked for the Ordnance Board and the Admiralty up until a few weeks before their death in 1944 .
Fifteen Fellows of the Royal Society and three Nobel Laureates ( Chandrasekhar , Dirac , and Mott ) were supervised by Fowler between 1922 and 1939 . In addition to Milne , they worked with Sir Arthur Eddington , Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar , Paul Dirac and Sir William McCrea . It was Fowler who introduced Dirac to quantum theory in 1923 . Fowler also put Dirac and Werner Heisenberg in touch with each other through Niels Bohr . At Cambridge they supervised the doctoral studies of 64 students , including John Lennard-Jones , Paul Dirac and Garrett Birkhoff .
The Fowler Islands , in Crystal Sound , on the Antarctic Peninsula were named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in their honour .
Personal life
Fowler was a keen amateur cricketer who played as a wicket-keeper . They played for Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship in 1908 and 1909 .
In 1921 they married Eileen Mary ( 1901–1930 ) , the only daughter of Ernest Rutherford . They had four children , two daughters and two sons . Eileen died after the birth of their last child . One of their grandchildren is Mary Fowler , a geologist and the sixth Master ( 2012–2020 ) of Darwin College , Cambridge .

The following is an armorial of the thirty individuals , who have served as governor general of Canada since Confederation .
To date , all former governors general have been granted armorial achievements , otherwise known as coats of arms , with the most recent being granted to Julie Payette in 2017 . The coat of arms of present governor general Mary Simon are expected to be released in 2022 .
Prior to 1952 , the majority of governors general inherited their arms and as such the designs of those arms usually do not reflect them personally . Plaster carvings of the coats of arms of the first twelve governors general after confederation , from Lord Monck to Lord Byng , are displayed in the chambers of the Speaker of the Senate of Canada .

Bothwell and Uddingston is one of the twenty wards used to elect members of the South Lanarkshire Council . It elects three councillors .
As its name suggests , the ward 's territory comprises the adjoining suburban villages of Bothwell and Uddingston , bounded by the River Clyde to the west and south , and the M74 motorway to the north and east bordering the Thorniewood ward of North Lanarkshire ( the localities of which were often historically considered parts of Uddingston , particularly before the two parts were divided between the districts of Hamilton and Motherwell in 1975 ) ; these boundaries were unaffected by a 2017 national review . The population in 2018 was 13,104 .
The ward was formed from the boundaries of three wards under the previous single-member system used from the creation of South Lanarkshire local authority in 1995 until 2007 : Bothwell South , Uddingston South/Bothwell and Uddingston .

Criminal Intelligence Service Canada ( CISC ; ) is an inter-agency organization in Canada designed to coordinate and share criminal intelligence amongst member police forces . Established in 1970 , the CISC has a central bureau in Ottawa and ten bureaus in each province offering services to over 400 law enforcement agencies in Canada .
Organization
There are three levels of membership in the CISC . Level I is for police forces responsible for federal and provincial law enforcement which have their own criminal intelligence unit . Level II is for member agencies that have a specific law enforcement role , e.g. , the Canada Border Services Agency and Wildlife Service . Level III is for agencies that have a complementary role to law enforcement or give assistance to law enforcement . The level of membership is mirrored to membership with the Canadian Police Information Centre .
Intelligence units of member agencies supply their provincial bureau of the CISC with raw intelligence data , which is then added to an online database , Automated Criminal Intelligence Information System ( ACIIS ) . The Ottawa Bureau is the custodian of the national database , and manages it in consultation with member agencies . The purpose of the CISC initiative is to not only coordinate information sharing across jurisdictions , but to facilitate investigations into organized and serious crime across Canada .
The central bureau is staffed by Royal Canadian Mounted Police employees along with secondments from the following agencies :
Canada Border Services Agency
Canadian Forces Military Police
Ontario Provincial Police
Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Service de police de la Ville de Montréal
Sûreté du Québec
Toronto Police Service
Vancouver Police Department
Plans
The CISC has a strategic plan consisting of four pillars .
The first pillar is criminal intelligence personnel . According to this pillar , the CISC intends to improve national criminal intelligence by directing resources to the cultivation of intelligence expertise and equipment and to attract talent in this field to the CISC through its hiring policies .
Secondly , the CISC aims to provide support to its intelligence personnel through the direction given by the leadership of the organization , by making the necessary technological tools available to intelligence personnel based on the `` need to know/right to know '' principle , and by facilitating the analysis of intelligence data through training personnel in intelligence analysis methodology and best practices . The second pillar also includes disseminating processed intelligence back to member agencies and measuring the `` value added '' of criminal intelligence through assessing feedback and determining the satisfaction of members with the service through a performance-measuring tool called the `` balance scorecard . ''
The third pillar is `` criminal intelligence technologies , '' meaning the maintenance of the ACIIS system and data mining technology , and keeping up-to-date as new technologies develop . The fourth and final pillar is the `` criminal intelligence communications plan , '' which consists of coordinating information flows between member agencies as well as with members and non-member partners and instilling strategic-thinking on a national scale in criminal intelligence workers .
The CISC also publishes an annual report on organized crime in Canada .

As Chief Statistician they designed and implemented a thorough reform of the statistical system of the organization and launched the `` Global Project on the Measurement of Progress in Societies '' , which fostered the setting up of numerous worldwide initiatives on the issue `` Beyond GDP '' . They also established the `` World Forum on Statistics , Knowledge and Politics '' , organising the first editions of the Forum , held in Italy ( 2004 ) , Turkey ( 2007 ) and South Korea ( 2009 ) . In particular , at the end of the 2007 Forum the `` Istanbul Declaration '' on `` Beyond GDP '' was signed by the OECD , the European Commission , the United Nations , the United Nations Development Programme , the Organisation of the Islamic Conference , the World Bank and several other institutions .
During these years , Giovannini was also a member of several important international bodies : Chair of the Conference of European Statisticians , a body of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ( UNECE ) , Chair of the Board of the World Bank International Comparison Program for the measurement of purchasing power parities worldwide , advisor to the European Commissioner for the Environment and member of the Board of the Canadian Index of Wellbeing and of the UK Measuring National Wellbeing Advisory Forum .

From June 2011 to April 2013 they were Chair of the Conference of European Statisticians , a body of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ( UNECE ) , and Chair of the Board of the World Bank International Comparison Programme for the measurement of purchasing power parities worldwide .
Minister of Labour
On 28 April 2013 Giovannini was appointed Minister of Labour and Social Policies in the cabinet led by Enrico Letta . It was the so-called Grand coalition government , with support from the centre-left Democratic Party ( of which Letta was Deputy Secretary ) , the centre-right People of Freedom , of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , and the centrist Civic Choice . Letta 's government became the first in the history of the Italian Republic to include representatives of all the major candidate-coalitions that had competed in the election .
On 14 June 2013 Giovannini participated in a summit at Palazzo Chigi , promoted by Prime Minister Letta , with Ministers of Economy and Labour of Italy , Germany , France and Spain on the issue of youth unemployment . On 15 June , the government issues the `` Decree of doing , '' measure aimed at hiring policies for economic recovery , of which Giovannini was among the main proponents .
As minister , Giovannini also simplified the apprenticeship , with the aim of accelerating the enter in the world of work for young people .
However , the growing criticism of the slow pace of Italian economic reform left the government increasingly isolated . On 13 February 2014 , following tensions with their left-wing rival Matteo Renzi , Letta announced they would resign as Prime Minister the following day . The Democratic Party voted heavily in favour of backing Renzi 's call for a new government , a `` new phase '' and a `` radical programme '' of reform . Minutes after the PD national committee backed the Renzi 's proposal by 136 votes to 16 , with two abstentions , Palazzo Chigi – the official residence of the prime minister – said Letta would be going to the Quirinale on Friday to tender their resignation to Giorgio Napolitano . In a speech earlier , Renzi had paid tribute to Letta 's government , saying the meeting was not intended to put it `` on trial '' . But , without directly proposing themselves as the next premier , they said the eurozone 's third-largest economy urgently needed `` a new phase '' and `` radical programme '' to push through reforms . The motion made clear `` the necessity and urgency of opening a new phase with a new executive '' . Speaking to the party leadership , Renzi had said Italy was `` at a crossroads '' and faced either holding fresh elections or a new government without a return to the polls . On 14 February 2014 Giorgio Napolitano accepted Letta 's resignation from the office of Prime Minister and Giovannini was succeeded by Giuliano Poletti as new Minister of Labour and Social Policies .
After the government
After the fall of Letta 's government , Giovannini returned to their academic career . They are currently co-chair of the `` Independent Expert Advisory Group on the Data Revolution for Sustainable Development '' , established by the Secretary General of the United Nations , co-chair of the Statistical Advisory Panel for the Human Development Report of the United Nations and co-chair , along with Joseph Stiglitz , of the Strategic Forum on the measurement of well-being , joint initiative of the International Statistical Institute and of the International Economic Association .
Giovannini serves also as chair of the Advisory Boards of European Projects E-Frame and Web-COSI , member of the High-Level Expert Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress established by the OECD , member of the Council of the International Statistical Institute ( ISI ) , member of the `` Commission Economique de la Nation '' of the French Government , as well as member of the Board of the `` Agnelli Foundation '' , of the `` Enel Foundation '' , of the `` Aurelio Peccei Foundation '' , of the `` Save the Children – Italy '' , of the `` WWF – Italy '' .

The lesser kiskadee ( Philohydor lictor ) is a species of passerine bird in the family Tyrannidae . It is the only species in the genus Philohydor . It is found in Brazil , Bermuda , Bolivia , Argentina , Colombia , Ecuador , French Guiana , Guyana , Panama , Peru , Suriname , Trinidad , Guatemala , and Venezuela . Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist shrubland and swamps .
The lesser kiskadee was described by the German naturalist and explorer Hinrich Lichtenstein in 1823 and given the binomial name Lanius lictor . The present genus Philohydor was introduced by the American ornithologist Wesley Edwin Lanyon in 1984 . The word Philohydor is from Ancient Greek philos for `` -loving '' and hudōr , `` water '' . The specific epithet lictor is the Latin word for a magistrate 's bodyguard who carried out sentences . It is sometimes placed in the genus Pitangus with the great kiskadee .
There are two subspecies :
P. l. panamensis ( Bangs & Penard , TE , 1918 ) – east Panama and north Colombia
P. l. lictor ( Lichtenstein , MHK , 1823 ) – east Colombia through the Guianas south to Bolivia , east and central Brazil
The lesser kiskadee is in length and weighs around . It lives in eastern Panama and throughout the northern parts of South America , usually near water .

Canadian Forces Detachment Dundurn ( also CFD Dundurn ) is a Canadian Forces facility located near the town of Dundurn , Saskatchewan and approximately 40 km south of Saskatoon , Saskatchewan along the east bank of Brightwater Creek .
Camp Dundurn
In 1858 the area that now forms Camp Dundurn was used as a camping grounds for Metis hunters . Much of the early construction work was done in the 1930s as a Unemployment Relief Camp was set up to build the base facilities . This included the construction of an airstrip and 45 permanent buildings along with roads , railway spurs and several bridges .
The area was used by Canadian Army units as early as 1928 when it was organized as Dundurn Military Camp ( also Camp Dundurn ) . During World War II the Royal Canadian Air Force constructed a bombing range on the base and the Canadian Women 's Army Corps established one of its first units at Camp Dundurn . The A27 Canadian Armoured Corps Training Centre ( A27 CACTC ) moved to Camp Dundurn from Camp Borden on January 28 , 1942 . A27 CACTC was later renamed A27 Canadian Reconnaissance Training Centre ( A27 CRTC ) and it remained on the base until March 1945 . During World War II over 50,000 soldiers trained at Camp Dundurn before being assigned to duty overseas . Following the war , Camp Dundurn remained open as a military facility and it was used as a transit hub and holding area for troops returning from the war .
In 1947 , the No . 6 Ordnance Ammunition Depot opened and permanent married quarters ( PMQs ) were constructed for personnel and their families . Military consolidation during the 1960s in the lead-up to unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968 saw Camp Dundurn made a detachment of CFB Moose Jaw in 1966 for administrative purposes .
In 1988 , administrative control of CFD Dundurn was reallocated to CFB Winnipeg 's 17 Wing .
Canadian Forces Ammunition Depot - Dundurn
In 1947 , No . 6 Ordnance Ammunition Depot an ammunition storage facility was established at Camp Dundurn .

Boris the Bear is a fictional comic book character featured in several comic book titles published between 1986 and 2008 . The series began as a response to the popularity of the wave of anthropomorphic animal titles that began with the publishing of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 1984 . That title , itself a parody of popular comic books at the time such as Daredevil , inspired numerous knock-offs and parodies like Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters , Pre-Teen Dirty-Gene Kung-Fu Kangaroos , Mildy Microwaved Pre-Pubescent Kung Fu Gophers and Geriatric Gangrene Jujitsu Gerbils which led to what many refer to as the Black-and-White Boom of the mid-1980s . The Boris character started as bear who was tired of these comic books and decides to kill them in a hyper-violent style reminiscent of 1980s films such as Rambo . After the first issue , Boris the Bear continued to fight parodies of the Transformers , Marvel Comics , Swamp Thing , and Elfquest before moving on to more character-driven stories .
Publication history
Starting in July 1986 and created by James Dean Smith and written by Mike Richardson and Randy Stradley , Boris the Bear was the second title published by Dark Horse Comics . Telling the story of an anthropomorphic bear , who is soon revealed to be a robot , the book parodied many other comic book characters while also satirizing the comic book industry as a whole . Often extremely violent , the book was a black comedy that developed a cult following . The title also served as the introduction to Wacky Squirrel , created by Mike Richardson and Jim Bradrick , who gained their own popularity and went on to star in their own series and specials published by Dark Horse .
Early issues of Boris the Bear centered on parodies of industry trends at the time . For example , the first issue , titled Boris the Bear Slaughters the Teenage Radioactive Black Belt Mutant Ninja Critters features Boris disposing of characters resembling the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Usagi Yojimbo , Cerebus the Aardvark , the Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters , Hamster Vice , and others in an extremely violent matter . The trend continued through the early issues of the title with Boris confronting or parodying characters resembling the Transformers , the heroes of the Marvel Universe , Swamp Thing , Batman , and Elfquest . It was n't long before Boris even met the actual T.H.U.N.D.E.R . Agents .
The popularity of Boris led to two early appearances in the third and fourth issues of the first volume of Dark Horse Presents as well as full color reprints of the first three issues of their own book , under the title , Boris the Bear Instant Color Classics . The character 's popularity also led to parodies of Boris themselves and “ revenge ” stories appearing in titles such as Blackthorne Publishing 's Laffin ' Gas , Slave Labor Graphics ' Samurai Penguin and Eclipse Comics ' Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters .
In 1987 , a disagreement with Dark Horse , over the direction of the title , convinced Smith to take Boris back from Dark Horse after the twelfth issue , and begin self-publishing the book under their own Nicotat Comics banner . The book picked up with the thirteenth issue , one month after the departure from Dark Horse . Nine months later , Nicotat introduced what was intended to be an ongoing second title , Boris ' Adventure Magazine . The original Boris continued to parody other comic books , although in a less vicious way , while also maturing into more of a somewhat serious adventure title . As the title changed and the book began shipping more and more infrequently , readership dropped and sales decreased . Eventually , despite Smith having the title plotted through the fortieth issue , Nicotat ended its run with the thirty-fourth issue in November , 1991 .
In 1992 , Boris briefly returned to Dark Horse with a short story in the sixty-fourth issue of Dark Horse Presents .
In July , 1996 , Nicotat returned to the Boris character with a second issue of Boris ' Adventure Magazine . The title ran bi-monthly for two more issues , through November , 1996 . Solicitations for the fifth and sixth issues were sent to retailers but the actual issues were never published . The book was officially canceled in 1997 .
In April , 2007 James Dean Smith began self-publishing again under the name Oasis Comics . Smith handled writing , art , lettering , editing and production chores on a brand-new Boris the Bear title that began with a new first issue . Boris The Bear : A Fall Into Spring Special followed in 2008 . That same year , Smith announced that they were working on a Boris the Bear online comic strip , as well as a new one-shot comic book titled Boris the Bear : Pissed but neither of these projects materialized .

South Africa cricket match fixing refers to match fixing performed by several players of the South African cricket team , during their tour to India in the year 2000 . The team was led by Hansie Cronje .
Timeline
On 7 April 2000 , Delhi police Crime Branch officer Ishwar Singh Redhu revealed they had a recording of a conversation between Cronje and Sanjay Chawla , a representative of an Indian betting syndicate , over match-fixing allegations . Three other players , Herschelle Gibbs , Nicky Boje , and Pieter Strydom , were also implicated .
On 8 April 2000 , the United Cricket Board of South Africa denied their players were involved in match-fixing . Cronje said `` the allegations are completely without substance '' . However , on 11 April Cronje was sacked as captain after confessing to Ali Bacher that they had not been `` entirely honest '' . They admitted accepting between $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 from a London-based bookmaker for 'forecasting ' results , not match fixing , during the recent one day series in India .
In May 2000 , the South African president Thabo Mbeki appointed a Commission of Inquiry into Cricket Match Fixing and Related Matters , with judge Edwin King as chairperson . On 7 June , the King Commission began . The following day , Gibbs revealed that Cronje had offered them $ 15,000 to score less than 20 runs in the 5th ODI at Nagpur . They also admitted another offer of $ 15,000 to Henry Williams to concede more than 50 runs in that same match . Gibbs scored 74 off 53 balls and Williams injured their shoulder and could n't complete their second over , so neither received the $ 15,000 . Off-spinner Derek Crookes , who was also a witness , admitted being surprised to open the bowling at Nagpur .
On 15 June , Cronje released a statement that revealed all their contact with bookmakers . In 1996 during the third Test in Kanpur , they were introduced to Mukesh Gupta by Mohammad Azharuddin . Gupta gave Cronje $ 30,000 to persuade the South Africans to lose wickets on the last day to lose the match . South Africa were 127/5 chasing 460 , Cronje was already out and spoke to no other players . `` I had received money for doing nothing . '' During the return tour , Cronje received $ 50,000 from Gupta for team information .
In the 2000 Centurion Test , Marlon Aronstam contacted them offering R500,000 ( approximately £50,000 at the time ) for the charity of their choice together with a gift if Cronje declared and made a game of it . They also admitted asking Pieter Strydom to place a R50 bet on South Africa to win for him . After the match Aronstam visited Cronje , giving them two amounts of money ( R30,000 and R20,000 ) together with a leather jacket . The promised R500,000 did not materialise . Before the one-day series , Cronje received repeated calls from `` Sanjay '' asking them to fix a match . Cronje gave them the names of Gibbs , Strydom and Boje to try to get rid of him . Cronje was offered $ 140,000 for the fifth ODI if Gibbs scored under 20 , Williams went for more than 50 and South Africa scored around 270 .
On 28 August , Gibbs and Williams were suspended from international cricket for six months . Gibbs was fined R60,000 and Williams R10,000 . Strydom received no punishment .
On 11 October , Cronje was banned from playing or coaching cricket for life . They challenged their life ban in September 2001 but on 17 October 2001 , their application was dismissed .
Cronje was killed in a private plane accident in 2002 .
Subsequent reporting on Cronje 's involvement in match-fixing revealed that Cronje had more than 70 bank accounts in the Cayman Islands which were , because they were not declared to the South African Revenue Service , illegal . The South African investigation was terminated at their death : but the implication of the multiple accounts was that the match-fixing was much more widespread than had been revealed to the King Commission .
After 13 years on July 22 , 2013 the Delhi Police registered an FIR for match-fixing in 2000 , the chargesheet in the case involving several South African cricketers including Cronje .

Back to the Bible is an international Christian ministry based in Lincoln , Nebraska , United States .
History
Founded in 1939 by Theodore H. Epp on radio station KFOR ( AM ) in Lincoln , Nebraska , Back to the Bible expanded by supporting missionaries and broadcasting via shortwave radio to other countries . By the mid-1950s , it was being broadcast somewhere in the world in any given minute , and in 1954 the organization 's first international Bible teaching ministry office opened in Canada . By the time of Epp 's retirement in 1981 , the Back to the Bible program was syndicated as a daily 30-minute broadcast on more than 800 radio stations worldwide .
Under Epp 's direction , the broadcasts were also noted for music by the Back to the Bible Choir and quartet . Several popular phonograph recordings were made by the choir in the 1940s and 1950s . Back to the Bible also had a weekly youth program on Saturdays , featuring a youth choir and serialized adventures with a Christian theme , such as the Danny Orlis series written by Bernard Palmer . Both the music segments and youth program were discontinued in the 1980s .
By the 1970s the organization had offices in Australia , Canada , Colombia , Costa Rica , Ecuador , England , France , India , Italy , Jamaica , Mexico , the Philippines , South Africa , Sri Lanka and Venezuela .
Warren W. Wiersbe , former pastor of Moody Church in Chicago , Illinois , served as leader of the Lincoln-based ministry between 1984 and 1989 . They were followed by Woodrow Kroll .
2010s
Back to the Bible announced Woodrow Kroll 's retirement in January 2013 . Dr John Munro , senior pastor at Calvary Church in Charlotte , North Carolina , became the program 's next Bible teacher and served from August 2013 . In August 2014 they were removed from this position following a complaint from a member of their church staff ; after investigation by the church they were reinstated as senior pastor , but Back to the Bible stood by its decision to dismiss them from their role there .
From August 2014 to June 2016 , the daily Back to the Bible program featured Bible teaching from Warren Wiersbe , David Chadwick and Darrell Bock .
In July 2016 , Ron Moore , pastor of The Bible Chapel in the Pittsburgh area , was named president and Bible teacher . They served as president until February 2018 , and was succeeded by David Platt .
Back to the Bible ceased broadcasting on the radio in October 2020 ; it has continued to be produced as a podcast , with the ministry stating that brokered programming fees on most religious stations had made continuing to syndicate the program no longer viable .
Current situation
Back to the Bible has offices in nine countries outside the United States ( Canada , Ecuador , India , Indonesia , Jamaica , Japan , Nepal , Sri Lanka , Trinidad & Tobago ) and broadcasts in multiple languages .
The charity has a 2-star rating from Charity Navigator , an independent evaluator of American charities .

An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific `` All-America '' and typically referred to as `` All-American athletes '' , or simply `` All-Americans '' . Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit , the term is used in the United States team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media . Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889 .
The NCAA recognizes two different All-America selectors for the 1983 college baseball season : the American Baseball Coaches Association ( since 1947 ) and Baseball America ( since 1981 ) .

Rock music in New Zealand , also known as Kiwi rock music and New Zealand rock music , began in 1955 with Johnny Cooper 's cover version of Bill Haley 's hit song `` Rock Around the Clock '' . This was followed by Johnny Devlin , New Zealand 's Elvis Presley , and their cover of `` Lawdy Miss Clawdy '' . The 1960s saw Max Merritt and the Meteors and Ray Columbus & the Invaders achieve success . In the 1970s and early 1980s the innovative Split Enz had success internationally as well as nationally , with member Neil Finn later continuing with Crowded House . Other influential bands in the 1970s were Th ' Dudes , Dragon and Hello Sailor . The early 1980s saw the development of the indie rock `` Dunedin sound '' , typified by Dunedin bands such as The Clean , Straitjacket Fits and The Chills , recorded by the Flying Nun record label of Christchurch . New Zealand 's foremost hard rock band Shihad started their long career in 1988 .
1950s
Rock music began in New Zealand in 1955 when Wellington-based country singer Johnny Cooper ( popularly known as the `` Maori cowboy '' ) recorded a cover version of American Bill Haley 's hit song `` Rock Around the Clock '' for HMV , the first rock and roll record recorded outside the United States . In 1956 , Cooper wrote and recorded an original song called `` Pie Cart Rock and Roll '' . The song referred to a pie cart that they visited while managing talent shows in Whanganui . The song is believed to be New Zealand 's first indigenous rock and roll recording , although `` Resuscitation rock '' , written by Wellington teenager Sandy Tansley in March 1957 , may have been released a few weeks earlier than Cooper 's song . Singer Johnny Devlin was touted as New Zealand 's Elvis Presley and their cover of `` Lawdy Miss Clawdy '' remains one of New Zealand 's biggest-selling singles , having sold 100,000 copies in 1959–60 . In 1959 , Mabel Howard , Minister of Social Welfare , went to see Johnny Devlin perform at the Christchurch Town Hall , declaring at half-time , `` There 's nothing much wrong with rock and roll '' . New Zealand 's studios lagged behind their counterparts in the Northern Hemisphere and 1950s recording stars The Tumbleweeds recorded six of their hit albums in the living room of one of their band members .
1960s
New Zealand radio 's conservative programming approach was increasingly challenged by young people in the 1960s . Radio Hauraki initially began life as a pirate radio station , broadcasting in international waters 50 miles ( 80 kilometres ) offshore from Auckland in the Hauraki Gulf , a deliberate move that allowed them to circumnavigate restrictive broadcasting legislation and broadcast their own playlist . This in part spearheaded the way for the gradual deregulation of the radio industry . Towards the end of the 1960s radio stations like Radio Hauraki , and later Radio I , were playing exclusively rock and pop music to a teenage and young adult audience .
The 1960s also witnessed a dramatic rise in locally written and recorded popular music . However many pop bands and performers of the time also released their own versions or `` covers '' of hits by overseas artists . It was an era when vinyl reigned supreme and teenagers queued outside local music and record shops to buy the latest hit singles . The Fourmyula 's `` Nature '' , written by Wayne Mason in 1969 , still retains considerable popularity and was voted the top New Zealand song of the last 75 years in 2001 .
In Christchurch , Max Merritt and the Meteors played regularly at The Teenage Club , and achieved iconic status in New Zealand with their songs `` Get a Haircut '' and `` C'mon Let 's Go '' . Ray Columbus & the Invaders were influenced by the early 1960s work of Cliff Richard and the Beatles . Columbus styled their band on the mod look and they were noted for their Fender equipment and vivid blue suits . After the Beatles toured New Zealand in 1964 Ray Columbus & the Invaders had a number one hit in Australia and New Zealand in 1964 with their cover version of `` She 's a Mod '' , a song by The Senators .
1970s
In contrast to the 1960s , relatively few New Zealand groups released records . In 1976 , six million records were sold , with only seven singles and four albums from local performers reaching the Top 50 . The following year eight singles and three albums charted , but overall record sales dropped to five and a half million .
Some of the more influential rock bands in the 1970s were Th ' Dudes ( whose guitarist Dave Dobbyn formed DD Smash in the 1980s ) , Dragon , Hello Sailor and Split Enz , fronted by Tim Finn , and later , their brother Neil Finn who went on to form Crowded House .
The first punk rock bands – including the Suburban Reptiles and the Scavengers – formed in Auckland in the late 1970s and were soon followed by groups in Christchurch , Wellington and Dunedin . With guitarist Alec Bathgate , Knox formed the Tall Dwarfs and , with a rudimentary four-track TEAC tape deck , they began recording various post-punk bands that had cropped up in Dunedin , starting with the Clean .
The Redwood 70 music festival , held six months after Woodstock in 1970 , was cautiously sub-titled New Zealand 's first national music convention . Held at Redwood Park in Swanson in Auckland 's far west , the festival was organised by Auckland promoter Phil Warren . Redwood 70 's headline act was a newly solo Robin Gibb , backed by a string quartet . The New Zealand groups who made up the bulk of the two-day festival 's entertainment were less mainstream than Gibb and played rock music . Though over 9000 fans attended , the festival lost money , a pattern that has continued in New Zealand in regard to multi-day outdoor festivals in this country . There were smaller festivals in 1971 – the Englefield Rock Festival at Belfast near Christchurch , another at Waikanae over Easter weekend , and the University Arts Council 's Jam Factory in July .
The Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival of early January 1973 , was organised by music promoters Paul Raymond and Barry Coburn . They followed the Woodstock template closely , including plans for a live album and film , which is how the New York state festival turned a profit . They chose a rural site with good access to large population centres , arranged trains from Auckland and Wellington , and selected international headline rock acts including Black Sabbath and Sandy Denny . They drew heavily on the still vibrant counter-culture for New Zealand performers like Blerta , Mammal and Billy TK and Powerhouse . Only 18,000 fans paid the $ 8 to attend ; 25,000 were needed to make a profit . Problems with inadequate space and toilets added further costs . Neither a film nor live album eventuated ( although some live recordings were made ) . Even so , music historian John Dix considered the event a success : it was a key event in New Zealand rock history , which introduced the acts that would dominate the local music scene in the mid-1970s .
The 1979 Nambassa Festival , held on a 400-acre farm on Landlyst Rd in Golden Valley , just north of Waihi , drew over 65,000 fans and was a key event for New Zealand 's hippie generation . Nambassa was named after the Big Nambas tribal group from northwest Malekula , Vanuatu . Organiser Peter Terry was inspired by the groups 's traditional lifestyle , self-sufficiency , and lack of exposure to western commercialism . The headline act was Little River Band . Media reaction to Nambassa was mostly positive . The Auckland Star ran extensive coverage and the Dominion devoted its front page to the event . Peter Terry used the Woodstock model to successfully spin off a feature film and a book from the event , for which a profit of $ 200,000 was eventually declared .
1980s
The 1980s saw the emergence the independent labels like Propeller Records in Auckland and Flying Nun record label in Christchurch who were highly influential in the development of modern indie rock . Early 1980s Dunedin groups like The Clean , and Straitjacket Fits and The Chills , recorded by Flying Nun , typified what became known as the ‘ Dunedin sound ' – droning vocals , jangly guitars , simple drumbeats and keyboards , and saw some success internationally particularly on American and European college radio . The Chills were an inspiration for Californian bands like Jay Reatard , Ty Segall , and Wavves .
Split Enz , Th'Dudes , Dragon , and Hello Sailor continued to gain chart success in New Zealand and other parts of the world . Ex-members of Split Enz then went on to form Crowded House , one of New Zealand 's most successful bands . Phil Judd , another ex-Split Enz member , formed The Swingers who released `` Counting the Beat '' in 1981 .
By the late nineteen-eighties , the New Zealand punk generation was ageing , anti-socialist reaction had curbed the generosity of the dole , which in turn reduced the free time New Zealand musicians had directed towards writing and performing .

The District Service Medal ( DSM ) was a medal awarded in lieu of the General Service Medal ( Rhodesia ) ( GSM ) for service on operations undertaken for the purpose of combating terrorists or enemy incursions into Rhodesia . It was awarded solely to African members of INTAF in uniform . This is unusual as non-whites in all other branches qualified for the GSM or the Prison Service Medal ( PSM ) . The DSM is therefore the only racially exclusive service medal in the Rhodesian Honours System .
Medal
The medal bears a relief portrait of Cecil Rhodes on the obverse and the words `` FOR SERVICE '' surrounded by a wreath of flame lilies on the reverse . The ribbon of the medal is a plain , dark blue . The medal was impressed in small capitals with the recipient 's name , rank and service number on the rim .
Recipients
5470 Rhodesian District Service Medals were issued . Awards were not gazetted , and no full roll of recipients has ever been published .

Antoine-Marie Roederer ( 14 May 1782 - 15 March 1865 ) was a French administrator and writer who served as Prefect of Trasimène under the First French Empire and was made a Peer of France by Louis-Philippe in 1845 . In the Nobility of the First French Empire Roederer was created a Baron by Napoleon .
Biography
The son of Pierre Louis Roederer and their wife Ève Régine Louise Walburge de Guaita , Antoine-Marie was born on 14 May 1782 in Metz , where their father was a councillor to the parlement . Elected to the Estates General of 1789 in 1789 , Pierre Louis Roederer played a prominent role during the Revolution and was an ally and supporter of Napoleon Bonaparte in the coup d'état of 18th Brumaire in 1799 , becoming a leading member of the Bonapartist regime .
Through the influence of their father , Antoine-Marie was then appointed an auditor of the Council of State and followed the former to Naples , where the elder Roederer was made Finance Minister for Joseph Bonaparte upon the French conquest of that kingdom . Their father having followed Joseph Bonaparte to Spain in 1808 , Antoine-Marie remained in Naples attached to the government of the new king , Joachim Murat .
Upon Napoleon 's annexation of the Papal States the following year , Roederer was appointed Prefect of the newly created Department of Trasimène , under which name Umbria had been incorporated into the French Empire . The name derived from Lake Trasimene , the fourth largest in Italy , which lay the centre of the province , and which the classically-minded Napoleon would doubtless have known from the famous Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217BC , at which Hannibal had decisively defeated the forces of the Roman Republic . Taking up their post in Spoleto on 6 September 1809 , Roederer governed Trasimène loyally until its dissolution upon the fall of Napoleon in 1814 , when the territory was returned to the restored Papal States .
During that time , the Prefect attempted to bring life in Umbria into line with that prevailing in the rest of the French Empire , introducing the Napoleonic Code and imposing the provisions of the Concordat of 1801 upon the Umbrian Church . Both these measures however , especially the Napoleonic Code 's legalisation of divorce and the suppression of monastic institutions and confiscation of church property mandated by the Concordat , met with harsh resistance from a populace and clergy who had until recently been under the direct rule of the Pope , and so in large part sheltered thus far from the secularising innovations of the Revolution . Throughout their tenure , Roederer therefore found themselves engaged in a bitter struggle with the Umbrian clergy as a result of the French reforms , and in consequence of Pius VII 's injunction to their former subjects not to co-operate with the usurpers who had occupied their states in any matter contrary to Church law . The Umbrian clergy refused en masse to swear the oath of loyalty to the new government , and Roederer admitted that if a loophole in the Concordat had not exempted parish priests from the requirement to swear , Mass would have fallen silent in Umbria , as there would then have been no priests left there at all . By May 1811 the arrondissement of Spoleto , Roederer reported 100 out of 174 curés were either under arrest or deported for refusing to take the oath . On 11 September 1811 Napoleon made them a member of the Legion d'Honneur .
During the Hundred Days Roederer briefly served Napoleon once again as the Prefect of Aube .
Under the Bourbon Restoration they lived mostly in retirement , writing a history of the Roederer family and economic studies on tax reform and free trade . They purchased a chateau in Ménilles in 1838 , and was made a Peer of France by Louis-Philippe in 1845 . They lived to see the return of a Bonapartist regime and in 1858 Napoleon III promoted them to be an Officer of the Legion d'Honneur . They died in their home at Ménilles on 15 March 1865 and was buried with their wife .
They married Adélaïde Berthier , daughter of César Berthier , the brother of Louis-Alexandre Berthier , with whom they had four daughters .

Prince Andrew Romanoff ( born Andrew Andreievich Romanoff ; 21 January 1923 – 28 November 2021 ) was a Russian American artist and author . They were a grand-nephew of Russia 's last Tsar , Nicholas II . They were a great-great-grandson in the male line of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and since the death of Prince Dimitri Romanov in 2016 a claimant to the headship of the House of Romanov .
Childhood and education
Andrew Andreievich was born on 21 January 1923 in London , England , into the family of Prince Andrei Alexandrovich of Russia ( 1897–1981 ) and their first wife Princess Elizabeth Fabricievna , née Duchess of Sasso-Ruffo and Princess of San-Antimo . Their godfather was the future King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom .
The third child and youngest son in the family , Andrew Andreievich spent their childhood with their sister , Princess Xenia Andreievna , and their brother , Prince Michael Andreievich , in the guest house of Windsor Castle – granted to their family by King George V. Until age 12 , they studied at home and received a private traditional education , characteristic for the House of Romanov . Then they studied at Haileybury and Imperial Service College .

Following the death of their second wife , they moved to the city of Inverness , Marin County , California , where they worked as a carpenter and joiner , and later was engaged in a jewellery business .
They began to draw as a primitive artist , without formal art education , drawing pictures by intuition and relying on imagination . Andrew Andreievich also engaged in artistic photography . After retirement , they devoted themselves entirely to art . On their preferred medium of Shrinky Dinks ( plastic sheets that shrink by two-thirds when cooked in an oven ) , they drew and painted , shrinking the scenes , then mounted them on painted panels . Andrew 's artwork was firmly rooted in the traditions of American folk art . Their work typically depicted personal memories , impressions of American news , culture , and scenes of domestic life .

Saint Bienheuré ( Bié , Beatus ) is a semi-legendary saint of Vendôme . Tradition states that they lived in a cave near the town . Like Saint George , they are said to have fought a dragon . Their legend was conflated with that of Beatus of Lungern .
Legend
The legend states that Bienheuré fasted and prayed before fighting the dragon . According to the legend , the dragon was so large that when it went to drink from a river at some distance away , its tail still lay in its cave . It was also so large that it drained the Loir when it drank from it . There are three versions of this combat : the first states that the dragon fled at the sight of Saint Bienheuré ; the second version states that Saint Bienheuré defeated the dragon with one blow from their staff ; the third states that the dragon strangled itself with its chain .
Historicity
Bienheuré is identified with a missionary who traveled and preached in , besides Vendôme , Garonne , Laon , and Nantes . Their place of death is considered to have been Chevresson , near Laon .
Veneration
A chapel dating from the fifth century was built on the hillside where they are said to have lived .
L'Association du Faubourg Saint Bienheuré organizes an annual festival in honor of the saint on the second Sunday of May .

Gregg Thompson ( born August 4 , 1960 ) is an American former soccer player . They played as a defender who was the 1983 North American Soccer League Rookie of the Year . They were also voted team MVP ( by their teammates ) and the most Popular Player ( by the fans ) during their rookie year while playing for the Tampa Bay Rowdies . They spent two seasons in the NASL and four in the Major Indoor Soccer League . They were a member of the U.S. National Team from 1984 to 1986 and participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics . Thompson earned twelve caps with the United States national team .
High school and college
Thompson spent their early youth in California before moving to Stillwater , Minnesota when they were fourteen . They became a star athlete at Stillwater High School . Their high school did not have a soccer team when they moved to Minnesota , so Thompson played football and ran track while playing soccer with local youth clubs . They were an outstanding running back , averaging 8.9 yards per carry over their high school career while breaking over 40 football records at Stillwater High School . Thompson was fast running the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds and strong benching over 350 lbs . ( he weighed 165 pounds ) They earned All State honors and received football athletic scholarship offers from the University of Colorado , University of Minnesota , the University of Wisconsin–Madison , numerous Division II schools and all of the Ivy League programs .
Their biggest claim to fame was their accomplishments during the state semi-final game against Columbia Heights . There were 30 seconds remaining on the clock , Stillwater was losing the game 14-13 and the ball was 37 yards away from the goalpost . Stillwater decided to attempt a field goal . Thompson was the field goal kicker as well . Thompson was successful in making the 37-yard field goal but there was a penalty on the play . The refs moved the ball back 5 yards . Thompson was again successful in kicking a 42-yard field goal to win the game . It was later found out that Thompson completely tore their ACL and meniscus on the fifth play of the game ; nevertheless , their final game stats included throwing a touchdown pass , rushing for 125 yards and kicking the game-winning field goal .
Thompson also went to the state finals in track their senior year long jumping over 22 ' and triple jumping nearly 47 ' . ( his first triple jump as a junior in high school was the fifth best ever recorded in the state at the time ) While they were one of the best football players to come out of the state of Minnesota , they preferred soccer and chose to attend Indiana University when that school offered them an athletic scholarship to play soccer . Thompson was voted the Minnesota High School Athlete of the Year when they graduated from Stillwater in 1978 .
Thompson joined the Hoosiers in 1978 . They did not play in 1979 because of a knee injury , but became a regular through the 1980–1982 seasons . In 1982 , they captained Indiana as it ran to the NCAA championship game . In that game , Indiana went up against Duke University and its top defenseman Joe Ulrich . Thompson scored the first goal , but Duke replied and the game ended tied at one all . The game was in its eighth overtime when Ulrich fouled Thompson just outside the box . Thompson replied with a swerving free kick which found the net , giving Indiana its first national title . Thompson would come in second in the balloting for the Hermann Trophy that year , losing to Ulrich .
In 2007 , Thompson was inducted into the Indiana University Hall of Fame . One of only seven soccer players to be inducted into the IU Hall of Fame .
Professional
The Los Angeles Lazers of Major Indoor Soccer League selected Thompson with the number one selection in the 1983 MISL Draft . Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League selected Thompson as the first pick in the 1983 NASL college draft . They elected to sign with the Rowdies and was named the 1983 NASL Rookie of the Year after playing thirty games . Following the 1984 NASL season , the league collapsed . After the collapse of the NASL , the Rowdies traded Thompson to the Minnesota Strikers of Major Indoor Soccer League ( MISL ) . They remained with the Strikers through the 1987–1988 MISL season before retiring .
National and Olympic teams
At the end of the 1983 NASL season , Thompson joined the U.S. Olympic team as it prepared for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles . Thompson played all three games for the U.S. at the Olympics , including scoring the U.S. goal in its 1–1 tie with Egypt in front of 85,000 people at Stanford Stadium . The U.S. finished the first round at 1–1–1 and failed to qualify for the second round .
Even before the Olympic games , Thompson had earned their first cap with the U.S. national team in a May 20 , 1984 scoreless tie with Italy . They would go on to play a total of 12 times for the full national team between 1984 and 1985 , including several qualification matches for the 1986 FIFA World Cup . Their last national team game came in the May 31 , 1985 debacle in Torrance , California when the U.S. lost to Costa Rica . That loss cost the U.S. a spot in the final round of qualifications .

Sherwood is an unincorporated community at the north end of Crow Creek Valley in Franklin County , Tennessee , United States . It is located along Tennessee State Route 56 southeast of Winchester , and just north of the Alabama state line . Sherwood has a post office with ZIP code 37376 .
Geography and Location
The Crow Creek Valley , in which Sherwood is situated , is a relatively narrow valley surrounded on three sides ( north , east , and west ) by the Cumberland Plateau ( including Lost Cove ) , with the southern end of the valley opening toward Alabama . Crow Creek , which flows from Lost Cove Cave , drains the valley and flows through the western part of Sherwood , emptying into the Tennessee River at Guntersville Lake near Stevenson , Alabama , several miles to the south . Sherwood lies at an elevation of .
State Route 56 , the only major highway that passes through Sherwood , traverses the valley from north-to-south . To the north , the road ascends more than to Sewanee atop the Cumberland Plateau . To the south , the road continues into Alabama as State Route 117 , eventually reaching Stevenson . Railroad tracks run alongside the highway for much of its stretch in the valley .
History
Human habitation in the Sherwood area is very ancient as evidenced by the many thousands of Native American projectile points in the nearby fields . The town location is at the intersection of many old Native American routes which the modern trails and roads often follow . It is located on an old Stagecoach route approximately midway between Sewanee and Anderson , Alabama and is representative of the hamlets and villages that were once commonplace in the area coves and valleys .
A small community called Kitchen 's Station or Catchings Station had existed as a Stagecoach stop earlier at the location . Named for station master Meridith Catchings , the small community began appearing on railroad maps after the Civil War . The town of Sherwood was named for Charles D. Sherwood , lieutenant governor of Minnesota during the Civil War . The Tennessee State Legislature approved their charter for the Tennessee Immigration and Land Company on April 15 , 1878 . That same day , Sherwood purchased the 1,410 acres of land for their northern colony from John F. Anderson . On June 19 , 1878 a local paper announced that the name of Kitchen 's [ Catching 's ] Station would be changed to Sherwood . A number of sources have erroneously reported that Charles Sherwood was lieutenant governor of Wisconsin and that the town was established in 1875 . This information probably came from the Goodspeed History Tennessee : Giles , Franklin , Lincoln , and Moore Counties .
The Railroad
With the construction of the strategically important Cowan Tunnel to the north in 1852 , train stops were created through the Crow Creek Valley , including at Catchings Station ( Sherwood ) . Notably , at this station there were and continue to be pusher engines which are required to assist with train ascents up the steep mountain grade to the tunnel . Correspondingly , on the other side of the tunnel in Cowan , Tennessee , there are also pusher engines .
In 1915 , a passenger train and a freight train collided in Sherwood , killing fifteen and injuring twenty-two .
Gager Lime Company
The Gager Lime Manufacturing Company was established by Byron Gager in 1892 and operated a limestone quarry and lime kilns in the community . The lime production facilities operated until 1949 .
As of the 1930 census , Sherwood had 1,700 residents , but the community 's population declined to 900 in the 1950s as its economy stalled after the closing of the limestone plant .
The castle-like ruins of the lime production facilities and silos , which are unusual for their Egyptian Revival and Gothic Revival styling , remain in the community . The Tennessee Preservation Trust included them on its Ten in Tennessee Endangered Properties List for 2002–2003 , citing their architectural distinctiveness and expressing concern that a `` continued lack of maintenance '' threatened their survival .
Epiphany Mission
In 1899 , the Epiphany Episcopal Mission was established in Sherwood after the Episcopal church began to provide schooling for local children . The church structure was built in 1902 , replaced in 1928 , burned in 1960 , and then rebuilt in 1967 . The 1928 structure is maintained as a partial ruin on the grounds of the modern structure . During the Great Depression , the Episcopal priest Father George Jones began a publishing a series of pamphlets to raise funds and awareness of the improvised community ; these pamphlets were later republished in 1954 as book entitled Candles in the Dark Boreen .
Anguispira picta.jpg
In 1956 , the mission helped train a group of women and opened a shirt factory in Sherwood in an attempt to create local jobs .
Threatened snail species
The painted snake-coiled forest snail is only found in the Sherwood area . The snail was first found in the area in 1906 and was designated as a threatened species in 1978 . Anguispira picta has the common names of painted snake-coiled forest snail and painted tigersnail and is a rare species of air-breathing land snail , a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Discidae , the disc snails .

Hasb-e-Haal was launched on 9 January 2009 . Its idea basically comes from the old shows `` Jamhoor Di Awaaz '' and `` Nizam Din Di Baithak '' . Aftab Iqbal used to host the show at that time . The show was an instant hit . In April 2010 , Iqbal left the show due to undisclosed reasons .
Cultural effect
Due to the popularity of the show , several similar shows emerged . These include Khabarnaak on Geo TV , Khabardaar on Express News , 3 Idiots on Aaj TV , Masti Gate on ARY News , Mazaaq Raat on Dunya News and News Night on Din News .

Pellaea paradoxa is a small hardy fern found north of Sydney in eastern Australia and Lord Howe Island . Often growing in or near rainforests in rocky crevices . But it may occasionally be seen in drier areas . Fronds are usually curved , 4 to 9 cm long , and 1 to 4 cm wide . Leathery to touch and a dull green . Juvenile fronds may be heart shaped . The stalks are around 1 to 5 mm long . Sori appear in a band , usually 2 to 3 mm wide , at the edge of the underside of the fronds .
This plant first appeared in the scientific literature in 1810 as Adiantum paradoxum , in the Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae , authored by the prolific Scottish botanist , Robert Brown . The genus Pellaea was placed in the subfamily Cheilanthoideae of Pteridaceae by Christenhusz et al. , 2011 .

A snow squall warning ( SAME code : SQW ) is a bulletin issued by Environment Canada 's Meteorological Service of Canada and the National Weather Service in the United States to warn population of two types of snow events reducing visibility in blowing snow : lake effect snow squalls and frontal snow squalls .
Phenomenon
Lake effect snow squalls are generated by cold arctic air moving over unfrozen water of lake or sea . These will reduce visibility to less than 1 km and produce large accumulations of snow on the ground along narrow corridors in lee of the waters . Duration of these events can extend for days .
Frontal snow squalls are associated with a fast moving intense cold front in winter . Visibility must be reduced to less than 500 m , wind over 40 km/h with a wind shift . Quantities of snow is not important with this type but intensity is heavy for a short period , typically 10 to 20 minutes .
Criteria
Canada
In Canada , snow squall warnings are issued for conditions expected to be :
Heavy snow off an open body of water producing at least 15 cm accumulations per 12 hours and reducing visibility to less than 400 meters over a limited region .
Line of convective snow showers , associated with a cold front , reducing suddenly and for a short period the visibility in snow and blowing snow , causing difficult road conditions .
United States
Beginning November 1 , 2018 , the snow squall warning was declared operational in the United States , and the capability to issue these warnings was rolled out to all NWS offices in the US . These issuances are intended to warn drivers of potentially life-threatening road conditions . The warnings are issued in a polygon area , to make the warned area as localized as possible , similar to a tornado , severe thunderstorm , or flash flood warning .
Criteria for the National Weather Service to issue a snow squall warning include :
Visibility of less than one quarter of a mile
Sub-freezing temperatures on the ground
Expected to last in one area less than 60 minutes
Cause dangerous and life-threatening conditions

Forbidden Hours is a 1928 American silent romantic drama film directed by Harry Beaumont as a vehicle for Mexican-born star Ramon Novarro . It was the second of four films to pair Novarro with leading lady Renée Adorée .
Plot
Set in the fictitious European kingdom of Balanca , Prince Michael IV is being coerced , by their advisers , to marry a young woman of royal blood . However , they have fallen for a peasant .
Cast
Ramon Novarro as Their Majesty , Michael IV
Renée Adorée as Marie de Floriet
Dorothy Cumming as Queen Alexia
Edward Connelly as Prime Minister
Roy D'Arcy as Duke Nicky
Mitzi Cummings as Princess Ena
Alberta Vaughn as Nina
Maurice de Canonge as a bit Part ( uncredited )
Production
The film was shot in Los Angeles with a budget of $ 293,000 . Working titles included The Sun King , Their Night and The Loves of Louis . The script originally contained reworked plot elements from Man in the Iron Mask but these elements were eventually discarded and the film took on a more Prussian design scheme reminiscent of the earlier Novarro success , The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg . Plot elements were allegedly adapted from the reign of Louis XIV of France . The Palm Beach Post suggested that Marie of Romania had inspired the character of the Queen Mother , played by Dorothy Cumming .
News sources reported that Jacqueline Gadsden , Marcelle Corday and a Shirley O'Hara were also in the cast . Sven Hugo Borg may have also appeared in the film . In an expansion of the common silent-filmmaking convention of having live musicians on set , a vocalist worked on set to provide atmosphere for the actors ; singer Lillian Rosine is credited as having `` introduced the idea '' and may have performed this task on the Forbidden Hours set .
As originally scripted , Prince Michael eventually marries their betrothed in order to keep peace between their nation and hers . The concluding scene showed them passing a convent where Marie now resides as a nun . This ending , which deliberately recalled Student Prince , was changed to a happier one , but press materials were still issued by the studio detailing the original ending , causing some confusion in the press .
Reception
Forbidden Hours premiered at the Capitol Theater in New York on July 22 , 1928 . The film was greeted with mixed critical responses . The Film Daily described it as a `` rehash of Student Prince and Merry Widow themes . '' The Palm Beach Post , however , was one source who praised the film 's scenario , design and performances . Reviewer Anne Austin suggested in their report on the film 's altered ending that Renée Adorée seemed too old for the role of Marie .
As a prestige picture , Forbidden Hours was widely distributed and advertised . At the California Theatre in San Jose , California , it was accompanied by Hi-Yeller Idea , a live prologue staged by Fanchon and Marco .
Forbidden Hours eventually made a profit of $ 109,000 , but was considered a commercial disappointment by the studio . Long thought to be lost , it was discovered to have survived in 2000 , and had its first theatrical screening in seventy-three years at the Bijou Theater in Lincoln City , Oregon in 2002 .

Alien Syndrome is a video game by Totally Games , part of the Alien Syndrome franchise created by Sega . It was released for the PlayStation Portable and Wii in 2007 . This iteration takes place a century after the previous game and introduces role-playing elements to the gameplay .
Plot
The story picks up approximately 100 years after the original Alien Syndrome . The title is set in the far future , where interplanetary space travel is possible . Communication is lost with one of the stations on a distant planet , the Kronos , and Aileen Harding is sent to investigate . They quickly discover that Alien Syndrome is behind the disappearance and decides to fight the enemy and find out what happened to their boyfriend Tom .
Gameplay
Alien Syndrome is played as a top-down shooter , with players turning their characters the direction they would like to shoot . The game has 40 levels , with 5 bosses and 15 mini-bosses . Players customize their character to expand in-game strategy options .
Alien Syndrome offers up to 80 different weapons to use and hundreds of armor types as well as bonus items . Players are accompanied by a robotic drone ( SCARAB ) that serves as a storage space for items as well as a backup for the main character . As a constant companion , SCARAB can assist in fights and grant on-demand access to the character 's cache of weapons and armors . Players have both a life meter and a constantly refilling energy meter , with the latter reflecting shield power .
The game also features co-op multiplayer for up to 4 people on one screen for the Wii version . On the PSP version , the game features co-op multiplayer via a WiFi connection .
On the PSP , player movement and aiming are handled with the analog stick ; while a player is firing a ranged weapon , their facing is locked . On the Wii , movement is handled by the analog stick on the Nunchuk , while aiming is controlled by pointing with the Wii Remote .
The Wii version of Alien Syndrome differs very slightly as it emphasizes use of the Wiimote control scheme . Tilting the Nunchuk rotates the screen to change orientation . In addition , motion control-based minigames are available to the player to increase stats via DNA augmentation chambers found in various levels , defeat lock protection on golden chests with guided nanites to procure items with a variety of attributes as well as loot , and disinfect rare items afflicted by the Alien Syndrome with charged nanites to restore their attributes .
Reception
On the Wii , critical reception to this game was mostly negative . Both IGN and GameSpot praised the intuitive aiming controls , but complained about the lack of enemy variety and graphical difference between the Wii and PSP versions . Metacritic gave the Wii version of the game a rating of 48/100 . The PSP version was given a 51/100 rating .

The Delmé Quartet , aka The Delmé String Quartet , was a String quartet , founded in London in 1962 . In 1967 , it became the first string quartet to be attached to a British university as Artist-in-residence—in this case , the University of Sussex . The quartet also spent four years as performing Fellows at Lancaster University , and taught the art of quartet performance at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama . They toured extensively and released 30 albums .
History
The Delmé Quartet was founded by former London Symphony Orchestra lead violinist Granville Delmé Jones , former English Chamber Orchestra violinist Jürgen Hess ( violins ) , John Underwood ( viola ) and Joy Hall ( cello ) , who came up with the idea during a cab ride over London Bridge . Their plan was to play for their own pleasure but when the BBC asked them to play in a concert series of international chamber music at Royal Festival Hall , they were 'discovered ' and were immediately booked into a concert schedule . Jones died in 1968 ; they were replaced by Galina Solodchin . John Trusler and Jonathan Williams replaced Hess and Hall in the 1970s ; Hess left to become Leader of the London Bach Orchestra . Painter joined the quartet in 1981 .
The quartet collaborated with many notable composers , particularly with Robert Simpson—they recorded ten of their quartets , one of which ( No . 9 ) they commissioned , plus their String Trio , the Clarinet Quintet ( with Thea King ) , and the two-cello Quintet ( with Christopher van Kampen ) . They also worked with John McCabe , Christopher Headington , Wilfred Josephs and Daniel Jones , whose quartets they performed regularly at Jones 's Gower Festival .
Members of the Delmé Quartet played on several recordings by The Beatles . Hall can be heard on `` Strawberry Fields Forever '' ; Hess played on three Beatles albums : Revolver , Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Yellow Submarine . On the latter album , Hall , Hess and Underwood are the notable strings performance on `` Eleanor Rigby '' , and on `` She 's Leaving Home '' from Sgt Pepper ( among other songs ) . Solodchin played on three solo albums by Paul McCartney : Tug Of War ( 1992 ) , Pipes Of Peace ( 1983 ) and Off The Ground ( 1993 ) .
The Delmé Quartet performed internationally , including at the Salzburg Festival and , in 1993 , at Dvořák in Prague : A Celebration . In Britain , they played the Edinburgh International Festival , the Cheltenham Music Festival , the Swaledale Festival , the Kings Lynn Festival and the Three Choirs Festival .

François-César Le Tellier ( Paris , 18 February 1718Paris , 7 July 1781 ) , was the marquis of Courtanvaux , Count of Tonnerre , Duke of Doudeauville , and a French aristocrat , military officer , and scientist .
Background and early life
Le Tellier was born in an aristocratic family , the grand-grandson of Minister François Michel Le Tellier , marquis de Louvois . After receiving a basic education they joined the Army . In 1733 , aged 15 , they took part in their first campaign as an aid in the staff of Marshal Louis de Noailles , who was their uncle . Promoted to Colonel in 1740 , they led the Royal Regiment in the campaigns of Bohemia and Bavaria .
Scientific career
In 1745 , Le Tellier left the Army for health reasons . After a few years , they associated with Madame de Pompadour in an effort to revigorate dancing at the Court , from 1745 to 1754 . They also grew interested in natural history , chemistry , geography , physics , mechanics and astronomy .
They gave their son , Charles François César Le Tellier , a thorough education , which earned them an honorary seat at the Academy of Sciences .
Contributions to chemistry
Le Tellier worked on `` marine ether '' and on the `` inflammation of radical vinegar '' .
Marine chronometers
In 1767 , the Academy of Sciences offered a prize for building a marine chronometer . Le Tellier had a ship build , Aurore , which they used to test the various candidates in real conditions at sea . The expedition also comprised Pingré , Messier and the watchmaker Le Roy , who had built two of the chronometers . Aurore sailed off France , Flander , and Holland in a three-month-and-a-half cruise , sustaining several storms to test whether the chronometers could sustain the movements of the ship . They also made frequent calls to port in order to check the working of the mechanisms and the precision of the longitude measurements made with the chronometers . In 1769 , one of the Le Roy chronometers was awarded the prize by the Academy ,
Colombes laboratory
Le Tellier set up a laboratory and observatory in Colombes , which they would lend to their colleagues . They also had the tower equipped with state-of-the-art instruments , including some they had custom-built . They even built some themselves after designs by others , yielding signatures such as Jeaurat invenit , Courtanvaux fecit ( `` designed by Jeaurat and made by Courtanvaux '' ) .

Background
A lightweight bout between former interim UFC Lightweight Championship challenger Kevin Lee and Charles Oliveira served as the event headliner .
A middleweight bout between Brad Tavares and The Ultimate Fighter : Brazil 3 heavyweight winner Antônio Carlos Júnior was scheduled for the event .

In turn , Júnior suffered an unspecified injury and the bout was cancelled from the event .
A women 's strawweight bout between Paige VanZant and Amanda Ribas was scheduled for the event . However , VanZant was forced to pull out of the fight due to an undisclosed injury . VanZant requested to reschedule the bout one month later , but Ribas decided to remain at the event and Randa Markos stepped in as the replacement .
A flyweight bout between Su Mudaerji and Bruno Gustavo da Silva was scheduled for the event . However , due to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China , Mudaerji was forced to withdraw from the event as they would not travel to prepare for the fight and was replaced by promotional newcomer David Dvořák .
At the weigh-ins , Lee weighed in at 158.5 lb , 2.5 lb over the lightweight non-title fight limit of 156 pounds . They were fined 20 % of their purse and their bout with Oliveira proceeded as scheduled at a catchweight .
COVID-19 pandemic
On March 12 , the UFC announced that this event would take place behind closed doors ( for the first time in the promotion 's history ) after Ibaneis Rocha , the governor of the Federal District ( where Brasília is located ) , announced that large gatherings will be suspended or closed for a period of 5 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Both the UFC 's planned Thursday media day and Friday ceremonial weigh-ins were cancelled ahead of the card , with the official early morning weigh-ins being the only official fighter obligations that remained ahead of fight night .

Queen Street is a street in the City of London which runs between Upper Thames Street at its southern end to Cheapside in the north . The thoroughfares of Queen Street and King Street ( a northward continuation of Queen Street beyond Cheapside ) were newly laid out , cutting across more ancient routes in the City , following the Great Fire of London in 1666 ; they were the only notable new streets following the fire 's destruction of much of the City .
At the lower ( southern ) end of Queen Street is Southwark Bridge . The London Chamber of Commerce & Industry is located at No . 33 . At the upper ( northern ) end the street crosses Cheapside and becomes King Street , which leads to Gresham Street and the Guildhall . This creates a direct route from the River Thames at Southwark Bridge up to the Guildhall . Queen Street meets the newer Queen Victoria Street as well as Cannon Street . Minor roads off the street include Skinners Lane ( the home of the Worshipful Company of Skinners ) and Cloak Lane .
Two short sections of the street are pedestrianised , which together with a pedestrian-priority crossing of Cannon Street , forms a `` Central Plaza '' area . This was part of an award-winning public realm improvement scheme undertaken in 2006 . This pedestrianised part of Queen Street has been used as a location for a number of art events organised by the City of London Festival and the London Architectural Biennale .
Queen Street and King Street form part of an important route on the London Cycle Network which continues south over Southwark Bridge and north towards Moorgate .
Queen Street runs through the wards of Vintry and Cordwainer , and is in the postal code area EC4 . King Street is in the ward of Cheap and in postcode area EC2 .
King Street formed part of the marathon course of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games . The women 's Olympic marathon took place on 5 August and the men 's on 12 August . The four Paralympic marathons were held on 9 September .

The Nam : Vietnam Combat Operations is a freely-downloadable real time strategy game about the Vietnam War released in 2020 . It is a Vietnam War RTS that recreates company-sized combat operations covering Vietnam 's various conflicts with America , Cambodia and China .
Development
The game was developed over the course of 20 years , by amateur developer Tiger Yan using the Command and Conquer engine , and completed during the COVID-19 lockdown .
Originally covering just the American War from 1965 to 1975 , its twin expansion packs , The Nam : Wider War and The Nam : Tour of Duty , were released in 2021 to add new units , music and maps while expanding the game to include operations in Laos , Cambodia , the air war over North Vietnam and the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979 .
Gameplay
Players can play as either a US Marine Lieutenant Colonel commanding a full battalion , or a North Vietnamese Colonel commanding a full regiment . The US Marines can draw support from additional service branches like the Army for Special Forces ( SF ) troops , the Air Force and Navy for land and carrier-based air support , the Navy and Coast Guard for riverine warfare ships , South Vietnam 's Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) and even various tribes as mercenaries .
The expansion packs give Vietnamese Communist players access to more units , including the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , the Pathet Lao in Laos and even China 's People 's Liberation Army , who briefly invaded Vietnam in 1979 . These subfactions can only be accessed either by Americans or Vietnamese upon capturing special buildings .
The game has various units including Marine riflemen , Vietcong guerrillas , villagers , and animals , realistically representing combat in the Vietnam theater .

Abisha Woodward ( 1752–1809 ) , also known as Abashai Woodward , was an architect and contractor from New London , Connecticut that is best known for building lighthouses in the United States . They oversaw the construction of many of Connecticut 's earliest lighthouses , but also worked in New York and North Carolina during their career . The oldest surviving beacon built by Woodward is the New London Harbor Lighthouse , which they completed in 1801 .
Career
Woodward distinguished themselves in New London as a fine architect and contractor . Prior to building lighthouses , they were co-named in a contract for building New London 's new meetinghouse in 1788 . Home construction in town likely kept them busy around 1790 , a time during which New London was experiencing significant growth .
Woodward 's work on lighthouses began with a federal contract they won in 1793 to complete the Bald Headlight at Cape Fear , North Carolina , which was already partially constructed prior to their arrival . They later submitted a bid in 1796 to build the Montauk Point Lighthouse , but lost the contract to John McComb . After the turn of the century , Woodward secured contracts to oversee the construction of five lighthouses along the Connecticut coast and one in New York on the east end of Long Island .
Woodward constructed both wooden and stone lighthouses during their career . The last and longest-lived of their wooden lighthouses was replaced in 1841 after 36 years of service . Two of Woodward 's stone lighthouses , the New London Harbor Lighthouse completed in 1801 and the Faulkner 's Island Lighthouse completed 1802 , remain standing to this day and still serve as active aids to navigation .
Personal life
Abisha Woodward was born in 1752 and married Mary Spicer on March 20 , 1774 . They lived in New London , Connecticut where they were a prominent architect , contractor and alderman . Several of their children were born in Preston , Connecticut , suggesting that they probably lived there for some time , as well . Woodward owned extensive property in the southern states and bought some 4,000 acres of land in the north of Ohio , known at that time as the Firelands , to benefit the widows and orphans of Revolutionary War soldiers . They died on April 10 , 1809 in New London .

Villa Loyola is a centre in Ignatian spirituality run by the Society of Jesus in Greater Sudbury , Ontario , Canada . It is the only Canadian French-speaking Jesuit centre outside of Quebec . As well serving as a retreat centre it is also an ecumenical and interfaith conference centre . It is situated on the shore of Long Lake off Municipal Road 80 to the south of Sudbury 's urban core .
History
Foundation
Since the restoration of the Society of Jesus in the early nineteenth-century , French-speaking Jesuits ministered to the Franco-Ontarian population of Sudbury . In the 1960s , the Jesuits had to change their ministries . The creation of Laurentian University in 1960 led to the French-speaking Jesuits in Sudbury to move away from higher education . They handed over Sacred Heart College to the newly created university . The parish that they founded in 1883 , Sainte-Anne-des-Pins , was handed over to the diocese . The parish was a local French-speaking cultural centre .
Construction
Villa Loyola was built in 1962 by French-speaking Canadian Jesuits . It occupies an area of 12 acres on the southern shore of Long Lake . It was originally conceived as a retreat house . It offers courses and retreats in Ignatian spirituality based on the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola . Retreats are for a weekend , or a week , or for the full 30 days . It also offers training for prayer guides and spiritual accompaniment .
Renovation
In 1996 , the centre was renovated and so that it can offer space for seminars and conferences as well as the original program of retreats . It is also a centre for ecumenism and interfaith dialogue .

The MIFERMA Class CC 01-21 diesel locomotives were built by Alsthom in France between 1961 and 1965 . The locomotives had been commissioned by the Sociéte Anonyme des Mines de Fer de Mauritanie ( MIFERMA ) , then the owner of the Mauritania Railway , which , since its completion in 1963 , has connected the iron ore mine in Zouerate with the port of Nouadhibou , Mauritania .
The CC Class 01-21 locomotives were based upon the SNCF Class CC 65000 , a French passenger diesel locomotive also built by Alstom .
Like the CC 65000s , the MIFERMA locomotives were fitted with two diesel engines . However , the MIFERMA locomotives had more powerful versions of the engines . They were also equipped with a roof mounted `` skyline casing '' , which housed special filtration equipment , to deal with the unusually sandy and dusty Saharan atmospheric conditions .
Another change which made them differ from the CC 65000s was their use of different bogie trucks ( these being related to the trucks used on the CC 14000s ) and a lower carbody with cabs taken from the CC 7100s . The cabs were slightly altered as they featured an extra center cab door on each end .
In 1974 , the assets of MIFERMA were nationalized . Thereafter , the Mauritania Railway and its locomotives were owned and operated by the parastatal Société Nationale Industrielle et Minière ( SNIM ) .
Beginning in 1981 , the CC Class 01-21s were supplemented by US built EMD SDL40-2s . In September 1997 , they operated their last iron ore trains and subsequently , they were confined to SNIM 's passenger train services .

Benjamin Cromwell Franklin ( April 25 , 1805 – December 25 , 1873 ) was the first judicial officeholder in the Republic of Texas .
Franklin was born in Georgia , and educated at Franklin College at the University of Georgia in Athens , before being admitted to the bar in 1827 .

In March 1836 , the Republic of Texas captured a U.S.-owned brig , Pocket . Upon realising that this action could alienate the United States , the Texan government took steps to investigate the matter , and President David G.

Franklin was elected to represent Galveston in the House of Representatives in the Third , Fifth , and Eighth Texas Legislatures . Franklin was also elected to serve in the Senate of the Fourteenth Texas Legislature , but died 25 December 1873 , 2½ weeks before the start of the regular session

Big Indian is a hamlet within the Town of Shandaken in Ulster County , New York , United States . It is located along State Route 28 , within the Catskill Park , 17 miles west of Woodstock . The Esopus Creek flows through the area , as Birch Creek feeds in from the north . Big Indian Hollow is located slightly to the west , while Big Indian Mountain sits to the southwest .
Origin of name
Once a Munsee Native American man named Winneesook ( the name means `` snowfall '' ) lived near Marbletown , New York ; because of their height of about seven feet , they were also called Big Indian . They were in love with a local woman , Gertrude Molyneux , who eventually loved them as well ; because their parents opposed the match , they arranged a marriage with one Joseph Bundy . Disliking Bundy , Gertrude eloped with Winneesook into the wilderness . Some years later , a party of people searching for a missing cow was led by Bundy ; still seeking revenge , they accused `` that big Indian '' of stealing the cow . When they finally found Winneesook , Bundy shot them with their rifle and injured them severely ; after being left alone , Winneesook crawled to a pine tree where Gertrude found them later , dying . After Winneesook 's death and burial , Gertrude and their children moved to the site ; the hamlet of Big Indian later developed at that location . Local lore holds that the pine tree stood until the railroad through Big Indian was built in the 1880s .
Climate
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences , with warm to hot ( and often humid ) summers and cold ( sometimes severely cold ) winters . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system , Big Indian has a humid continental climate , abbreviated `` Dfb '' on climate maps .

Their first Broadway role was as a guard in Maxwell Anderson 's Barefoot in Athens in 1951 . Their other stage roles include Shaw 's Saint Joan , and Tiger at the Gates , Christopher Fry 's version of a Jean Giraudoux play , which ran 1959–60 on Broadway .

They were John of Gaunt in William Woodman 's filmed version of Shakespeare 's Richard II ( 1982 ) : while the cast 's acting was generally judged as poor , Charles R. Forker said McLiam delivered Gaunt 's most famous speech `` like an operatic aria '' but in general was no match for Sir John Gielgud at speaking verse .
McLiam portrayed Ellis Carter , a young man seeking freedom from their domineering brother , in the 1961 episode `` The Big Spender '' of the television series Window on Main Street .
In 1964 , they guest starred on Gunsmoke as a helpful crazy farmer named “ Delphos ” in the episode “ Big Man , Big Target ” ( S10/E10 ) .

The central character , played in that production by James Barton , is a father who renounces their faith following the death of their son and spends their savings on partying and loose women before having a heart attack . Though they attempt to resolve some of their family 's problems , they die unrepentant . Playwright and producer Maxwell Anderson , given the script to consider producing it , condemned the play as lying on well-trampled ground following Seán O'Casey 's Juno and the Paycock , declaring , `` I 've grown weary of the whole subject . An ancient , irritable , blasphemous , dying but loveable Irishman says their last ten thousand words and goes to their own place . The hell with him . ''

Surfing is a relatively new sport in Taiwan , though it has quickly gained popularity .
History
The Kuomintang-led government placed Taiwan under martial law from 1949 to 1987 . During this period , maritime access was limited , as the coastline was classified as a high-security zone . Baybay Niu , who began surfing in 2002 , is considered a pioneer of the sport in Taiwan .
Location
The eastern shores of Taiwan face the Pacific Ocean , and serve as major locations for surfing .
Period
People in Taiwan surf all year round except during the typhoon seasons , which has been prohibited by law since 2011 . The prohibition period starts after the Central Weather Bureau issues land warning .
Competitions
The Taiwan Open of Surfing has been held since 2010 , and is sanctioned by the World Surfing League .

The Glenford Bank is a historic bank in the small village of Glenford , Ohio , United States . Built in the early twentieth century , the building has served as a core component of village life for much of its history , and it has been named a historic site because of its distinctive architecture .
History
Glenford was founded early in the nineteenth century , but for much of its early history it was a small crossroads , consisting of an unplatted small mill town at a spot where Jonathans Creek could be forded . It was not until the railroads ran through it that it began to grow . By the 1910s , the village had grown to the point that some thought a bank could take its place in the community ; the bank was incorporated in 1916 , under the presidency of George Deffenbaugh Orr , and it soon began the construction of the present building . Built in 1919 , the bank was situated at the intersection of Main and Broad at the heart of the village . It only operated for little more than a decade before failing in 1932 . In later years , it served as a fire station for a time ; by the 1960s , it was being used as a community center , and the walls of the main meeting room had been painted to depict scenes from the community 's history . In 1987 , the owners began to restore the building ; performed under the leadership of Central Ohio Technical College professor Whitney Tussing , who operated a historic preservation-oriented architecture practice in Glenford , the project saw the building turned into a residence . In later years , Tussing 's work at the bank building attracted coverage with a program airing on HGTV , and Tussing themselves has spoken of the bank-to-house project as one of their leading projects .
Architecture
Built of brick on a brick foundation , the bank is covered by a slate roof and features various elements of stone ; a single-story rectangular building , its stretcher-bond walls are divided into two bays on some sides and three bays on the others . The main entrance is located in a recessed entryway at one of the corners ; concrete steps provide access to the entrance , which features a rounded archway above to its panelled ceiling . A subsidiary entrance is located nearby on the southern side ; it features a wooden cornice with Neoclassical ornamental urns , which together separate the transom from the fanlight . The building 's exceptional Neoclassical styling is reinforced by the interior , which includes carefully worked oak wood .
Historic designation
In early 1990 , three years after Whitney Tussing 's restoration project began , the Glenford Bank was listed on the National Register of Historic Places . It qualified for inclusion on the National Register because of its distinctive architecture ; the bank is a rare example of Neoclassical styling on a small-town bank from the early twentieth century . One of thirteen National Register-listed locations in Perry County , it is one of two in the Glenford area ; the other is the Glenford Fort , a large Hopewellian ceremonial enclosure constructed atop a nearby ridgeline .

Spathius galinae is a parasitoid of emerald ash borer . The known range of S. galinae extends from the Russian Far East to South Korea . It is currently approved for release in some areas of North America as part of a biological control program against emerald ash borer .
Beginning in early spring , adults lay eggs on host larvae by drilling into the tree with their ovipositor to reach the larva underneath the bark . The eggs hatch and consume the host larva . S. galinae larvae and pupae develop within the host gallery and emerge in approximately 35 days . Two to three generations occur per year . Prior to winter , pre-pupae halt development to enter diapause and overwinter within the tree .

Surprise Attack – Tunnel Warfare ( Chinese : 奇袭·地道战 ) is a 2020 film released online in China about a fictional story based upon the actual history of tunnel warfare that was used by Chinese partisans against Japanese occupational soldiers in World War 2 .
Japanese forces are doing sweeps of the North China Plain during World War II . A young student from Beiping named Ye Cheng comes to a village to help the communist partisans fighting against the Japanese . Using their knowledge , they help perfect and improve their tunnel systems which they are using to hide from and ambush the Japanese when they come to the village . They fight several battles with the Japanese , and in the final battle , they succeed in destroying a tower the enemy was using .
Plot
Japanese forces are doing sweeps of the North China Plain during World War II . Some villagers use tunnels to hide themselves and ambush the Japanese soldiers . Nagano ( Changye in Chinese ) is the Japanese commander who is leading their soldiers to do these sweeps .
A young student who studied in Beiping named Ye Cheng comes home to their village with the intention of becoming a teacher . They ride on a cart with their father , Ye Fugui , and a few others in the countryside . They then spot a group of Chinese villagers feeing from pursuing Japanese soldiers . One of the villagers is holding a package . Ye Cheng decides to help them .
The Chinese villagers arrive back at the village . One of them Sun Xiaorong , is the sister of one of the partisan leaders in the village Sun Dachun . They bring the package containing medical supplies to the communist party commissar Ma Fu , who directs them to use them for the wounded . Them brother Sun Dachun arrives and is upset that they did not know about their mission where they put themselves in danger . Ye Cheng and their father then arrive and meets Sun Dachen , who they knew as a child . Ye Cheng meets the commissar and announces their intention to become a teacher in the village . The commissar tells them that the previous teacher was killed by the Japanese three years prior and that the war has made it impossible to have classes . The commissar says that the partisans need intellectuals like him . Sun Dachun objects and does not want Ye Cheng to join the partisans . Ye Cheng tells Sun Dachun that they did not say that they wanted to join . They later meets Sun Xiaorong , who they recognized as being the villager they helped , but did not realize it was her , who they knew as a child . They tell them that they have studied to be a nurse and was helping the partisans .
At the Japanese camp , a new commander named Nakamura ( Zhongcun in Chinese ) arrives to help with the special warfare in engaging the villagers who are using tunnel warfare to fight the Japanese .
Ye Cheng takes over the eastern tunnels and gets the partisans to remake the tunnels according to their own design , including traps , hidden passages and other methods to lure the Japanese soldiers into ambushes when they try to enter the tunnels .
The Japanese soldiers under Nakamura make an attack on the village . They overwhelm the defenders in the western tunnels , who are forced to move to the eastern tunnels . When the Japanese soldiers enter the eastern tunnels designed by Ye Cheng , they are killed by the traps . When Nagano is hit by a trap containing poison gas canisters that the Japanese had used on the village earlier , Nakamura pulls off the attack and makes the Japanese retreat .
Ma Fu hosts a meeting of the partisans to talk about their plans . Ye Cheng arrives and tells the partisans an idea of his . There is an abandoned coal mine underneath the main Japanese base and they believe that a lot of natural gas will be trapped inside some parts of the mine . If they can get the gas to explode underground , it may destroy the Japanese base .
The partisans follow the plan . Many of the partisans are killed by the Japanese in the battle . Xiao Chou blows themselves up with a grenade in order to kill Nagano who is beating him . Sun Dachun sacrifices themselves to blow up the gas . The explosion destroys the tower containing the Japanese ammunition that leads to the destruction of the Japanese base . Nakamura is killed in the explosion .
After the battle is over , villagers find the earpiece that Nakamura used as a hearing aid and concluded they were killed . In another scene in the future , an old man , possibly an older Ye Cheng , has their son in a field where they have put up a sign on a scarecrow that reads '小心陷阱 ' ( beware of traps ) .

Pepducins are cell-penetrating peptides that act as intracellular modulators of signal transference from receptors to G proteins . Pepducins were first developed at the Tufts Medical Center laboratories of Dr. Athan Kuliopulos and Dr. Lidija Covic .
Pepducins employ lipidated fragments of intracellular G protein-coupled receptor loops to modulate GPCR action in targeted cell-signaling pathways . A pepducin molecule consists of a short peptide derived from a GPCR intracellular loop tethered to a hydrophobic moiety . This structure allows pepducin lipopeptides to anchor in the cell membrane lipid bilayer and target the GPCR/G protein interface via a unique intracellular allosteric mechanism . Pepducins for over 15 different GPCRs have been successfully produced , several of which have shown activity in preclinical in vivo models .
An anti-PAR4 pepducin extended bleeding time in mice and protected against systemic platelet activation and thrombosis .
A CXCR4 agonist pepducin mobilizes bone marrow hematopoietic cells .
A PAR1 pepducin , PZ-128 , has successfully completed phase I clinical trials .

Bernhard III , Margrave of Baden-Baden ( 7 October 1474 – 29 June 1536 ) inherited in 1515 part of their father 's margraviate of Baden . They ruled their part from 1515 until 1536 .
Their two brothers , Ernest and Philip inherited the other parts ; after Philip died , they and Ernest each inherited half of Philip 's part .
This created two lines of rulers :
`` Bernhardine line '' ( Catholic ) ruled Baden-Baden
`` Ernestine line '' ( Protestant ) ruled Baden-Durlach
The Bernhardine line died out in 1771 , allowing Margrave Charles Frederick of the Ernestine line to reunite the Margraviate of Baden .
Bernard was brought up at the court of Emperor Maximilian I and went to Spain with their friend , Maximilian 's son Philip I. Philip was appointed King of Spain in 1504 .
Margrave Bernhard tended in their later years to Protestantism and introduced the Reformation into the upper Margraviate .
Marriage and issue
Bernhard III married in 1535 , two years before their death , Franziska of Luxemburg , Countess of Brienne and Ligny ( d. 17 June 1566 ) , the daughter of Charles I , Count of Ligny . They had two sons ; the younger , Christopher , was born after Bernard 's death :
Philibert ( born : 22 January 1536 , died : 3 October 1569 )
Christopher ( born : 26 February 1537 ; died : 2 August 1575 )
Bernhard , however , had numerous extra-marital children , of whom six sons ( Bernard , Philip , John , George , Caspar , and Melchior ) are known . In 1532 , Emperor Charles V declared George , Caspar and Melchior to be legitimate princes , and later , Bernhard and Philip as well . These sons were not entitled to inherit , but they received a maintenance payment after their father 's death .

When Typhoon Vera hits Japan , Asa and their kidnapper must work together to survive .
In 2021 , Asadora ! won the Lucca Comics Award for Best Manga Series .
Plot
In 1959 , just moments before Typhoon Vera makes landfall at the Port of Nagoya , 12-year-old Asa Asada frantically seeks help from a local obstetrician to help deliver their mother 's twelfth child . When they witness Kasuga attempting a burglary during the storm , Asa is mistaken as a member of the doctor 's family and is taken hostage . When Kasuga realizes their mistake , they regret their actions , blaming their hard luck after returning from World War II as bomber pilot . They protect Asa from the storm 's damage , and the pair work together to distribute food to flood victims by flying a stolen airplane .
As they search the area for Asa 's home , they see a large monster 's footprint in the debris . Kasuga and Asa locate two of their siblings stranded on a rooftop with the obstetrician , who is holding a newborn child . Asa saves them from the monster , but discovers that Kasuga is wounded . They guide Asa as they fly the plane back to land , and Asa confesses their wish to keep the airplane . Asa attempts to blackmail the plane 's owner , who is secretly using the aircraft to smuggle drugs , and they sign over the plane to them before going into police custody .
Five years later , Asa is 17 years old and operating an aircraft company with Kasuga . Kasuga is visited by Colonel Shissoji , a former military commander , who shows them a recent photo of the same monster they encountered years earlier . Attempting to research the monster on their own , Asa meets young scholar Keiichi Nakaido at the National Museum of Nature and Science , who has photo evidence of the monster among the disorganized research left by their mentor , Shinnosuke Yodogawa . Colonel Shissoji gives Asa and Kasuga a secret mission to protect the opening ceremonies of the 1964 Olympic Games by converting their aircraft into a makeshift fighter plane . Meanwhile , Asa is pressured by their school friend Yoneko to accompany them to Tokyo for a singing audition , keeping it secret from their close friend Miyako . Restaurant owner Kinuyo , now acting as the remaining Asada children 's adoptive mother , defends them against local bullies when the youngest child , Koshichi , claims to remember seeing the monster even though they were less than a day old during the typhoon .
Meanwhile , the monster emerges in Sagami Bay , one day before the start of the Olympics . Colonel Shissoji collects Asa from school to bring them to the airfield in preparation to face the monster . Kasuga is unreachable after chasing a newspaper photographer away from the airfield , which results in an accident . Asa decides to fly the mission herself , but Nakaido insists on accompanying them so they can study the monster up close . Yoneko skips school to meet a talent agent but is secretly followed by Miyako .
When Asa and Nakaido confront the monster , they evade its attacks and launch the aircraft 's makeshift rockets , but the monster is unharmed . Asa decides to drop bags of fuel on it , lighting the gasoline on fire with their signal flare . The monster is wounded and chases after Asa , who leads it back out into the ocean away from coast . When Asa 's plane goes too far out to sea , Kasuga appears in a second aircraft to guide them back to land . Yoneko 's audition puts them in an uncomfortable situation , but Nakaido 's uncle Eisaku arrives at Asa 's request to chaperone them The agent and Eisaku team together to change Yoneko 's image to resemble to Marilyn Monroe , but they reject their efforts and returns home .

Background
Naoki Urasawa had the initial idea for Asadora ! after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami . Wanting a hero that would give readers hope , the author said the main character naturally became a woman because when they draw males the story tends to get dark and depressing . Wanting this character to confront a `` certain crisis '' at the 1964 Summer Olympics via airplane , they had to be 17-years-old at that point to get a pilot 's license . Additionally , while researching Urasawa stumbled upon the 1959 Isewan Typhoon , during which time the girl would be 12 , and decided it would be `` nice '' to begin the story with a 12-year-old girl . This also made Nagoya the setting for the manga . Yuki Takanami , editor of the French version of the series for Kana , stated that its title is a reference to NHK 's Renzoku Terebi Shōsetsu television dramas , which are colloquially known as `` asadora '' and often follow the life of a female protagonist from childhood to adulthood .
The sense of fulfillment Urasawa felt after doing all the backgrounds , inking , erasing , and screentones on the short story `` It 's a Beautiful Day '' led to them doing a lot of the background work on Asadora ! by himself , in addition to the main character illustration .
Publication
Asadora ! is written and illustrated by Naoki Urasawa . The manga began in Shogakukan 's Weekly Big Comic Spirits on October 6 , 2018 . Asadora ! is Urasawa 's first work published digitally and their first work in the magazine since 21st Century Boys , serialized in 2007 . The series ' first arc finished in January 2019 , and it went on hiatus until May of the same year . The series went on hiatus again in August 2019 and resumed publication in October of the same year . Shogakukan has compiled its chapters into individual tankōbon volumes . The first volume was published on March 29 , 2019 . As of December 28 , 2021 , six volumes have been published .
In North America , Viz Media announced the English release of the manga in July 2020 . The first volume was published on January 19 , 2021 . The manga has also been licensed in France by Kana and in Italy by Panini Comics .
Volume list
Reception
Asadora ! won Best Series at the 2021 Lucca Comics Awards in Italy . It was also nominated for 2021 's Young Adults Best Comic Award at the 48th Angoulême International Comics Festival in France and for Best Manga at the Harvey Awards in the United States . Due to depicting the Isewan Typhoon , Asadora ! was used as part of an exhibit at the Nagoya City Minato Disaster Prevention Center .
After reading the first volume , South Korean film director Bong Joon-ho wrote that `` Asa 's wise expression and dignified demeanor already gives me hope and strong expectations '' , and called Urasawa `` the greatest storyteller of our time '' . They likened the experience of reading Asadora ! to that of being able to go back and read 20th Century Boys for the first time again .
Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network gave the first volume an A− grade . They wrote : `` This is a very solid work . Asa is the kind of spitfire hero that 's easy to get behind . '' Reuben Baron of Comic Book Resources said , `` As a piece of historical fiction , Asadora ! is so convincing that it 's almost a surprise once the science fiction elements pop up again in the last two pages of the book .

Pearce 's mule teams carried the mills ' production to market in Tuscumbia . as improved roads and railroads drove commerce to Hamilton and other nearby towns , the store closed in 1930 , and the mills ceased operation in 1959 .
The mills were demolished in 1970 for safety reasons , however the dam and portions of the gristmill remain . The family home , built in 1878 , was initially a two-room dogtrot structure . Rooms were added in the early 1900s and in 1916 , a second floor was constructed . Stone fireplaces were added in the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration . Other remaining structures on the site include the two-story Victorian general store , built in the early 1870s ; a tenant farmers ' house ; a former blacksmith shop ; a barn ; a shed ; the family cemetery ; and an abandoned bridge .
The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 .
Demographics
Pearce 's Mills appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated community ( village ) of 70 residents . This was the only time it appeared on census rolls .

Gunzelin of Kuckenburg ( – after 1017 ) was Margrave of Meissen from 1002 until 1009 .
They were the second son of Margrave Gunther of Merseburg ( – 982 ) , thereby the younger brother of Margrave Eckard I of Meissen , and possibly half-brother ( or brother-in-law ) of the Polish prince Bolesław I the Brave . Gunzelin held allods around Kuckenburg Castle ( in present-day Obhausen ) near Querfurt .
After the death of their father at the 982 Battle of Stilo , their elder brother was enfeoffed with the Margraviate of Meissen by King Otto III . In 1002 , following Eckard 's failed attempt at the throne in the German royal election and their subsequent assassination , Bolesław occupied Meissen , but the new king , Henry II forced them to leave it and accept the March of Lusatia with the adjacent Milceni lands instead . Lusatia was thus detached from Meissen , which was bestowed on Gunzelin at Bolesław ' demand .
In Autumn 1004 , Gunzelin took part in Henry 's successful siege of Bautzen ( Budusin ) , which had been occupied by the Poles in 1002 . It is reported by Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg that the castle would have been razed if not for Gunzelin 's insistence that the Poles be allowed to depart freely and the castle preserved . The retreating Poles , however , devastated parts of their march . Gunzelin thereafter resided in Budusin .
Gunzelin feuded with their nephews , Herman and Eckard II , in what was one of 11th-century Germany 's ugliest civil wars . The feud concerned `` the insult and humiliation entailed in taking and destroying a fortified residence . '' It also concerned the allegation that Gunzelin had sold captured Wends to the Jews as slaves . The slave trade in Slavs was a large issue in northeastern Germany at the time . Sometimes even fellow Germans were enslaved . Most slaves were the product of capture in war . The Church , however , largely opposed the slave trade : Thietmar railed against the `` barbaric '' practice the Saxons had shown of dividing up families in order to sell them .
Gunzelin and Bolesław maintained friendly relations until 1009 , when the former was deposed by King Henry on suspicion of an alliance with Bolesław against him . The margrave had travelled to Merseburg for a Fürstentag , where on June 5 they were arrested and handed over to the safekeeping of Bishop Arnulf of Halberstadt . Their margraviate was bestowed on their nephew Herman ; while Gunzelin themselves was imprisoned for eight years in the farming village of Ströbeck near Drübeck Abbey in the Saxon Harzgau . According to legend , Gunzelin spent their imprisonment playing chess and teaching it to their guards . Other sources name Bamberg as their place of detention . Released in 1017 , they died soon thereafter .

Christopher Tsai ( born December 20 , 1974 ) is a Chinese-American investor and noted art collector . They are the founder of Tsai Capital Corporation , a New York-based investment management firm .
Early life and education
Born in Greenwich , Connecticut to financier and fund manager , Gerald Tsai , and model and actor , Marlyn C. Tsai , Tsai attended the prestiguous Brunswick School in Greenwich , Connecticut and graduated in 1993 . Tsai began their career in finance at the young age of 11 , working for their father , where they were tasked with analyzing investment opportunities for the Tsai family foundation . At age 18 , Tsai studied securities analysis at the New York Institute of Finance .
Tsai attended Vermont 's Middlebury College , where they graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy and International Politics and served on the Middlebury College Arts Council .
Career
Tsai began investing at the age of 11 when they purchased five shares of an insurance company . They used money they made from gardening for the investment and made a $ 25 profit . Tsai recounts they convinced the broker to waive the fee for the transaction as it was more than the profit they made from the investment .
While working for their father at the age of 16 , they began informally investing money for friends and business owners they knew from growing up in Connecticut .
They launched Tsai Capital in 1997 after working as an equity analyst for Bear Stearns and interning for value investors Mario Gabelli and John A. Levin . Tsai credits Benjamin Graham 's The Intelligent Investor and Philip Arthur Fisher 's Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits as two of their influences . Their investment approach was also influenced by Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway .
Tsai is president and chief investment officer of Tsai Capital , an SEC-registered , value-oriented investment firm headquartered in New York City and focused on the long-term growth and preservation of capital . They founded the company in 1997 at the age of 22 and serves as chairperson of the firm 's advisory committee Tsai has written articles about art as an investment , including commentary in Investment and Pensions Europe `` about investing in art as an alternative assets class '' , and `` Back Door to China , '' specifically advocating investment in Chinese contemporary art , for Worth . Bloomberg , L.P. notes that they `` has also been interviewed on Bloomberg Radio , China Money Network , Fox Business , [ and ] The Street.com TV '' , and `` has written extensively about investing in emerging markets '' .
In 2014 , Tsai launched Tsai Ventures , the venture capital arm of Tsai Capital . CrowdTangle , a Tsai Ventures portfolio company , was acquired by Facebook on Nov. 11 , 2016 . Founded in 2012 , CrowdTangle had raised $ 2.2 million in venture funding from Tsai Ventures and other venture capital firms .
Art collection
Tsai is an avid art collector and first focused on contemporary Chinese art , which they accurately predicted would rise in value . Tsai is the world 's largest collector of works by Ai Weiwei .
Tsai attributes their love of art to their father who collected works by Alexander Archipenko , Alexander Calder and Joan Mitchell . Through the Stockamp Tsai Collection , Tsai regularly contributes artwork to museums . These museums have included the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , the Pérez Art Museum Miami , the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne .
Prior to deciding to build a collection around Ai , Tsai collected contemporary Chinese art broadly , beginning in 2003 . Tsai traveled to China and acquired some 50 works by artists including Fang Lijun , Liu Xiaodong , Xie Nanxing , Zhang Huan and Zhang Xiaogang . In September 2004 , Tsai published an article in Worth Magazine arguing that contemporary Chinese art was undervalued . In 2005 , Tsai reiterated that contemporary Chinese art was undervalued , particularly when compared with contemporary Mexican artists .
Tsai adheres to a well-defined methodology in making art acquisitions , balancing instinct and analysis . Tsai has expressed interest in collecting the work of David Hammons and Berlinde De Bruyckere . Tsai prefers that the artwork they buy stays undervalued for as long as possible . Tsai stated , `` It 's like buying shares in a company that you know will be worth more in five or ten years . The last thing we want is for the stock to go up as we start buying . '' Tsai has been critical of art speculators looking to buy art for short-term financial gain .
Personal life
In addition to Tsai being the son of a famous investor , their grandmother , Ruth Tsai , was a pioneer for women in Shanghai . During World War II , they were the only woman to trade on the floor of the Shanghai Stock Exchange until Japanese troops occupied the Shanghai International Settlement on December 8 , 1941 , and trading was abruptly halted . Tsai is married to André Stockamp .
Tsai is a know philanthropist and has supported organizations such as the Asia Society , the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum , and the World Monuments Fund to name a few .

iDAI.objects arachne ( short form : Arachne ) is the central object-database ( administrator : Reinhard Förtsch ) of the German Archaeological Institute ( DAI ) and the Cologne Digital Archaeology Laboratory ( CoDArchLab ) at the University of Cologne .
Arachne is intended to provide archaeologists and Classicists with a free internet research tool for quickly searching hundreds of thousands of records on objects and their attributes . This combines an ongoing process of digitizing traditional documentation ( stored on media that are both threatened by decay and largely unexplored ) with the production of new digital object and graphic data . Wherever possible , Arachne follows a paradigm of highly structurized object-metadata which is mapped onto the CIDOC-CRM , to address machine-readable metadata strategies of the Semantic Web . This » structured world « of Arachne requires high efforts in time and money and therefore is only possible for privileged areas of data . While on the ever-increasing range of new , digital born data in reality only a small effort-per-object ratio can be applied . It therefore requires a “ low-threshold ” processing structure that is located in the » unstructured world « of Arachne . All digital ( graphic and textual ) information is secure on a Tivoli Storage System ( featuring long-term multiple redundancy ) and distributed online through the Storage Area Network in Cologne .
Object modelling and design
Arachne 's database design uses a model that builds on one of the most basic assumptions one can make about archaeology , classical archaeology or art history : all activities in these areas can most generally be described as contextualizing objects . Arachne tries to avoid the basic mistakes of earlier databases , which limited their object modelling to specific project-oriented aspects , thus creating separated containers of only a small number of objects . All objects inside Arachne share a general part of their object model , to which a more class-specific part is added that describes the specialised properties of a category of material like architecture or topography . Seen on the level of the general part , a powerful pool of material can be used for general information retrieval , whereas on the level of categories and properties , very specific structures can be displayed .
Arachne aims to create interoperability between different systems while protecting the copyrights of the authors . The Arachne database is a central subsystem of the iDAI.welt , the software architecture of the German Archaeological Institute , consisting of various interconnected modules and oriented in their data on open access and in its programming to open source . The modules of the iDAI.welt ( e.g . iDAI.objects , IDAI.field , iDAI.gazetteer ) are in a constant process of development by new technological and scientific methods and possibilities . Interoperability is becoming increasingly important , especially between Arachne as an image and object database and the various geographical information systems ( GIS ) , used on excavations and surveys , to combine different categories of data while keeping redundant data as low as possible . Another central issue is the provision of URIs ( Universal Resource Identifier ) for all objects digitally captured . The integration of the CIDOC-CRM and the Open Archives Initiative into iDAI.objects is of great importance . As a partner of the project CLAROSnet a multilingual interface was created . Since April 2009 Arachne is i18n-ready , so the technical framework for internationalization has been implemented : until now ( December 2015 ) the arachne interface is available in German , English and Italian .
History
Arachne was developed in 1995 as a FileMaker-database and benefits since 2001 from the establishment of the Institute for Humanities Computing at the University of Cologne ( Historisch-Kulturwissenschaftliche Informationsverarbeitung , HKI ) , whose students started to use arachne as a realistic test environment for serious programming projects . Thanks to the significant and continuous support by the German Research Foundation ( DFG ) since 2001 Arachne integrates also negative archives , which have significantly expanded the data stock of Arachne , hence the archives of the photographers Barbara Malter and Gisela Badura-Fittschen were digitized and documented . Since 2003 the negative archives of ancient sculpture of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome were added . All that totaled in 40.000 high quality scans of ancient sculptures , that are presented with a state-of-the-art scientific documentation .
Since 2004 Arachne is operated by a consortium , consisting of the DAI and the CoDArchLab of the University of Cologne . In the same year Arachne has been reworked from the bottom structurally as well as editorially . The data of the FileMaker solution were exported , Arachne was rebuilt from scratch using an MAMP environment . Since 2006 as part of a multiphase-project ( Emagines ) , funded by the DFG , the glass negatives of the German Archaeological Institute were digitized and the records were provided in the arachne database ( finally 150,000 scans in 60,000 object records ) .
As a result of the Berlin Sculpture Network another important data stock were added within the years 2009-2012 : the Complete Catalog of Sculptures in the Antiquities Collection of the Berlin State Museums ( Antikensammlung der Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin ) , which includes revised scientific catalog texts , images ( colored ) and archive material ( “ Archivalien ” ) , altogether referring to 2,600 sculptures and are freely accessible in the Arachne since 2013 . Furthermore , there are approximately 3,500 plaster casts of the Berlin Abgußsammlung , already provided in Arachne and associated with the datasets of the originals mentioned above .
Another major step in the development of Arachne was the provision of engravings ( “ Stichwerke ” ) without existing copyrights by the DFG-funded project ( 2009-2013 ) `` Reception of Antiquity in a Semantic Network : Digital Books , Images and Objects ” . 2,300 engraving works have been initially provided in the TEI viewer - specially developed within the project - with OCR full text search . Further digital books and archive material coming from other projects were added . The total amount is shown in the iDAI.bookbrowser which enables a direct link between the represented objects of the 'real world ' and their textual descriptions in the digital books . The iDAI.bookbrowser supported by its OAI interfaces the METS metadata standard and is linked to external online portals ( Propylaeum , ZVDD ) .

Mission highlights
Soyuz TMA-19M was launched atop of a Soyuz-FG rocket at 11:03:09 UTC on 15 December 2015 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome , Kazakhstan . Following the launch , the Soyuz spacecraft successfully achieved orbital insertion 9 minutes later and began its 4-orbit journey to the Space Station . Unusually , while docking , the Kurs docking navigation system failed , and a manual docking had to be performed by Yuri Malenchenko . This delayed docking with the ISS by 10 minutes . The Soyuz docked with the ISS at 17:33:29 UTC the same day . The crew then boarded the ISS at 19:58 UTC .
Soyuz TMA-19M undocked on June 18 , 2016 at 5:52 UTC , after being docked for 186 days . The crew landed safely in Kazakhstan , southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan on 09:15 UTC .

A rhinectomy is the surgical removal of a nose . If only part of the nose is removed it is called a partial rhinectomy , while entire nose removal is called a total rhinectomy . Often , a nose prosthesis is required for rehabilitation .
History
Rhinectomy has traditionally been a form of disfiguring judicial corporal punishment . The ancient Egyptians removed the noses of some criminals and exiled them to the Sinai towns of Tjaru or Rhinocorura , whose own name was Greek for `` nose removal '' . The Byzantine Empire , believing that their emperor should represent a human ideal , removed the noses of both criminals and rival emperors , with the idea that such disfigurement disqualified its recipients from office . The notable exception was the second reign of , who gained the epithet Rhinotmetus or `` the Slit-Nose '' .

Fred Trosko ( September 5 , 1917 – February 6 , 1999 ) was an American football player and coach . They played at the halfback position for the University of Michigan football team from 1937 to 1939 . They later served as the head football coach at Eastern Michigan University from 1952 to 1964 .
Flint Northern High School
Trosko attended Flint Northern High School where they were a star athlete in football , basketball and baseball , earning three varsity letters in each sport . In 1934 , they were selected as an All-Michigan football player and broke the All-Valley Conference scoring record with 71 points ( breaking their own record of 66 points set in 1933 ) .
University of Michigan
Trosko enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1936 . Trosko was a multi-sport star at Michigan , earning nine letters in football , baseball and basketball . They played three years as a halfback for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1937 to 1939 . Trosko also handled place-kicking duties for the Wolverines and kicked the extra point that led Michigan to a 7–6 win over Illinois in 1937 . They received the Meyer Morton Award in 1937 as the football player who showed the greatest development and most promise as a result of the annual spring practice . In 1939 , they led Michigan to a 21–14 win over Ohio State when they ran 32 yards for the winning touchdown on a fake field goal attempt with 50 seconds left .
Trosko earned both bachelor 's and master 's degree in education from the University of Michigan .
World War II
After graduating from Michigan , Trosko accepted a position as the high school baseball , basketball and football coach at Hudson , Michigan . With the entry of the United States into World War II , Trosko joined the U.S. Army Air Corps . They attained the rank of captain and served two of their five years of military service in the European Theater of Operations . While serving in Europe , they met and married their wife . They were discharged from the military in May 1946 .
High school coach
In 1946 , Trosko was hired as an assistant football coach at their alma mater , Flint Northern High School . They served three years as an assistant coach under Guy Huston , who had been their coach in the 1930s .
In 1949 , Trosko was hired as an assistant football coach at Owosso High School in Owosso , Michigan . They were promoted to head coach in 1950 .
Eastern Michigan University
In July 1952 , Trosko was hired as head football coach at Eastern Michigan University ( then known as Michigan State Normal College ) in Ypsilanti , Michigan . The team improved markedly during Trosko 's early years as head coach . In their first seven seasons , the team attained a record of 41–19–2 , including a 7–1–1 record in 1953 and an 8–1–0 record in 1954 . Their teams won Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference ( `` IIAC '' ) championships in 1954 and 1957 .
The team 's success came to an abrupt end in 1959 . Trosko 's teams had a 29-game winless streak ( 0–27–2 ) starting with the third game of the 1959 season and continuing through the fifth game of the 1962 season . The precipitous decline followed the decision of the Eastern Michigan administration not to follow an IIAC policy that allowed member schools to award scholarships . Competing with non-scholarship athletes against conference schools with scholarship athletes , Trosko 's Eastern Michigan teams were unable to compete . In August 1965 , Trosko announced their resignation as the school 's head football coach , and it was reported that the resignation was the result of `` an apparent break with school administrators over policy . ''
Trosko had the second longest tenure of any head coach at the school . They also taught at Eastern Michigan and remained on the faculty at Eastern Michigan after retiring as football coach . They ultimately retired in 1981 as a professor emeritus . In 1982 , they were inducted into the Eastern Michigan Sports Hall of Fame .
Death and family
Trosko died at their home at Hilton Head Island , South Carolina in February 1999 . They were survived by their wife of 53 years , Leona , a daughter , Maureen , a son , Fred Trosko , Jr. , and five grandchildren .

Maria Teresa Magdalena Abellare Llamedo-Cruzata ( born July 22 , 1961 ) , professionally known as Dulce ( ) , is a Filipino singer and actor .
Early life
Llamedo was born to a poor family of musicians on July 22 , 1961 in Villa Bulsita , a sitio of Barangay Bulacao in Pardo , Cebu City . Them father , Leoncio , was a carpenter who played the double bass in the village band while their mother , Andrea , was a dress-maker who sang in their local chapel . They are the sixth of eight siblings having four sisters and three brothers .
Among their first five siblings , Llamedo is the only one who completed their elementary education ( she was able to send their two younger siblings up to college ) . However , due to financial problems , they could n't enroll even in public schools for higher education . They later attempted to finish high school through the Alternative Learning System . They started singing at a very young age , joining their first amateur singing competition when they were just two years old . When they were 10 , they became a regular at a Saturday television show hosted by Justo Justo . At 12 , they were already performing at soda fountains in Cebu City .
Career
In the early 1970s , they auditioned for Tawag ng Tanghalan but was initially rejected in their first attempt as they were still underaged . When they finally got to enter the competition , they became a weekly and then monthly champion but failed to make it to the grand championship . After the competition , they stayed in Manila for five months , performing covers of songs by Shirley Bassey , among others , and had occasional stints in bars and restaurants around downtown Manila , Quezon City and Laguna . They returned to Cebu with their mother but left and came back to Manila at age 16 where they worked as a singer at a club-restaurant owned by a `` controversial public official '' who had abused them It was in this club-restaurant , however , where Llamedo was discovered by the composer George Canseco who was searching for a singer to sing their theme for the 1978 film Miss Dulce Amor , Ina starring Lorna Tolentino . Considered to be their big break , from then on , Llamedo became known by their famous stage name Dulce .
In 1979 , Dulce recorded their most famous song Ako Ang Nasawi , Ako ang Nagwagi ( `` I Had Been Defeated , I Had Won '' ) . The song was sent by its composer , Canseco , to compete at the Metropop Song Festival but lost . Later that year , Dulce was sent to Hong Kong to compete at the Asian Singing Competition using an English - translated version ( adaptation , “ I Am Not Crying Over You ” ) of the song as their performance piece . She , however , decided at the last minute to scrap the English translation and sing it in its original Tagalog form . They won the grand prize of the competition and later recounted that their win was the event that changed their lives .
In the 1980s , there was an unofficial ban imposed on Dulce by several recording executives . During this time , they had joined the Philippine government 's `` Balik Saya '' musical caravan singing theme songs of local movies in the United States and Canada . Recording executives , however , would block other deals they would make calling them `` too rebellious '' .
In 1987 , Dulce placed first runner-up with Nonoy Tan 's entry “ Langit - Kung Kaya Ko Kaya Mo Rin ” at the ABU Popular Song Contest in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia . The following year , they won the Grand Prize at the Asia Pacific Singing Competition where they sang Memory . Dulce auditioned for the role of Gigi in Miss Saigon when the producers first came to Manila . They are , however , unable to proceed with the audition due to acute pharyngitis . When the production team came back in 1990 , they auditioned again and was instructed to fly to New York City . In New York , Cameron Mackintosh reportedly told them that they were `` over-qualified '' for the small role that was open and that it would be a waste of talent . Claude-Michel Schönberg is said to have commented that their voice `` is like a Boeing 747 taking off '' .
From 1991 to 2004 , Dulce 's rendition of Constancio de Guzman 's Maalaala Mo Kaya served as the theme song of the television drama anthology of the same name .
In 2003 , they received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Aliw Awards . That same year , they played Aling Saling in the first run of the musical Himala at the Cultural Center of the Philippines ( CCP ) . They returned to the musical theater stage in 2008 where they played Motormouth Maybelle in a local production of Hairspray also at the CCP .
Them other monikers include `` Asia 's Diva '' , `` Theme Song Queen '' , and `` Timeless Diva '' . They have since sung around 30 movie theme songs .
Personal life
Dulce first lived with singer / actor Danny Cruz , with whom they had three children . They are now married to Bernard Beltran Cruzata II , with whom they have two daughters , Jem and Abby .

The 1986 Bangladesh MV Shamia ferry incident refers to one of the worst maritime disasters in human history that occurred on 25 May 1986 on the Meghna River in Bangladesh , killing 600 passengers . The incident occurred when the overloaded MV Shamia , a two-decker merchant ship ferry , sank while carrying about 1,000 - 1,500 people from Bhola to Dhaka during stormy weather conditions . Initial reports cited between 40 and 240 dead with 500 missing .
At the end of Ramadan , a fasting month of muslims , many people were returning from their home cities to the capital Dhaka , after celebrating the religious holiday of Eid al-Fitr .
Background
It is believed that cyclone heavily affected the capital of Bangladesh , including its adjoining areas at the time of the accident . The riverboat Shamia was set on sail from Bhola to Dhaka with over 1,000 to 1,500 passengers despite having accommodation for 500 passengers only . Shamia capsized when strong winds struck the ferry in one of the widest parts of the Meghna River .
The President of Bangladesh of that time , Hussain Mohammed Ershad , suspended all double-decker boats within Bangladesh jurisdiction and several officials responsible for issuing maritime-fitness certificates , were suspended for allowing the structural-defective ferries to carry passengers .

New York State Route 14A ( NY 14A ) is a north–south state highway located in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States . It extends for from an interchange with NY 14 in the Schuyler County town of Reading to an intersection with U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) and NY 5 west of the Ontario County city of Geneva . In between , the two-lane route serves Yates County and the village of Penn Yan , located at the northeastern tip of Keuka Lake . Outside of Penn Yan , NY 14A traverses rural , rolling terrain dominated by farmland .
The route runs parallel to and west of NY 14 for its entire route between the Watkins Glen and Geneva areas . During the 1920s , NY 14A was part of NY 14 , which originally served Dundee and Penn Yan on its way from Watkins Glen to Geneva . NY 14 was moved onto its current routing alongside Seneca Lake as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , at which time the old inland alignment became NY 14A .
Route description
NY 14A begins at an interchange with NY 14 at Gabriel 's Junction , a hamlet north of Watkins Glen in the town of Reading . The route heads to the northwest , passing under the Norfolk Southern Railway 's Corning Secondary as it runs up the side of a hill . At the underpass , NY 14A for the next becomes the US Army Specialist Christopher J. Scott Memorial Highway . After , the highway takes on a more northerly routing , passing by several farms as it proceeds through Reading Center and toward the Yates County line . In one short stretch north of Reading Center , the highway crosses into Yates County , reenters Schuyler County , and heads back into Yates County . While in Schuyler County for the second time , it meets with the northern terminus of NY 226 .
Once it reenters Yates County , NY 14A runs due north across the town of Starkey to the village of Dundee , where it is known first as Main Street . Main Street becomes Water Street at the main intersection in Dundee , where it meets Union and Seneca Streets . At the north end of the village , it turns west on Millard Street at a junction near the Dundee Central School . NY 14A remains on Millard Street to the western village line , where it intersects Pre-Emption Road . This north–south highway marks the Preemption Line that divided the Iroquois lands of western New York awarded to New York from those awarded to Massachusetts by the Treaty of Hartford of 1786 . Just west of Dundee , NY 14A meets with the eastern terminus of NY 230 as well as the terminus of the Christopher J. Scott Memorial Highway .
From here , the route turns north and runs along the farmland-covered ridge between Seneca and Keuka Lakes , which features a thriving Mennonite community . The highway passes through the town of Milo , serving the small hamlet of Second Milo and the Penn Yan Airport before descending the ridge into Penn Yan , a village at the northeast end of Keuka Lake . It follows Brown and Liberty Streets in the village , sharing the road with NY 54 between Lake and Elm Streets . At the Elm Street intersection , located in Penn Yan 's central business district , NY 54A ends at NY 14A and NY 54—completing its alternate loop of the latter—while NY 54 leaves NY 14A to follow Elm Street out of the village . NY 14A continues on Liberty Street through the northern part of the village , where it meets the southern terminus of NY 364 at a junction adjacent to the Penn Yan Central School District 's campus .
North of Penn Yan , NY 14A enters the town of Benton , where it heads due north past several farms on the hilltop north of Keuka Lake . It goes through the hamlet of Benton Center before quietly passing into the Ontario County town of Seneca . In the hamlet of Hall , located north of the county line , NY 14A turns northeast , at which point the due north–south highway becomes County Route 5 . NY 14A continues in a general northeasterly direction as it winds its way toward the city of Geneva . Midway between Hall and Geneva , the route picks up NY 245 just before it crosses Wilson Creek , a small stream feeding into Seneca Lake . NY 14A and NY 245 continue northeastward across farmland into the town of Geneva , where both routes terminate at a junction with US 20 and NY 5 just west of the Geneva city limits in a commercialized area known as Lenox Park .
History
In 1908 , the New York State Legislature created Route 12 , an unsigned legislative route extending from Horseheads to Lyons via Watkins Glen , Penn Yan , and Geneva . When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , all of legislative Route 12 became part of NY 14 , which extended south to Elmira and north to Sodus Point . NY 14 was realigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to follow a new highway along Seneca Lake between Reading and Geneva . Its former routing via Penn Yan was redesignated as NY 14A . In Penn Yan , NY 14A once followed Main Street , located one block to the east of its current routing . The old route passes through the main downtown area and by the Yates County Fairgrounds . This alignment of NY 14A merged into the current route north of Penn Yan and used what is now Old Route 14A to reach modern NY 14A southeast of the village .

Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Cardoza-Fonseca , 480 U.S. 421 ( 1987 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case that decided that the standard for withholding of removal , which was set in INS v. Stevic , was too high a standard for applicants for asylum to satisfy . In its place , consistent with the standard set by the United Nations , the Court in held that an applicant for asylum in the United States needs to demonstrate only a `` well-founded fear '' of persecution , which can be met even if the applicant does not show that they will more likely than not be persecuted if they are returned to their home country .
Facts
Cardoza-Fonseca entered the United States in 1979 as a visitor from Nicaragua . They overstayed their US visa , and the INS began proceedings to deport them They admitted that they were in the US illegally but applied for two forms of relief in the deportation hearings : asylum and withholding of deportation . Under US law , the INS had the discretion to grant asylum to an alien eligible for that relief , but must withhold deportation if the alien is eligible for that kind of relief .
To support their request for asylum , Cardoza said that their brother had been tortured by the Sandinistas because of their political activities in Nicaragua . They believed that the Sandinistas knew that they had fled Nicaragua together and that even though Cardoza had not been politically active herself , they feared that they would be interrogated about their brother 's whereabouts and activities if they returned to Nicaragua . They also mentioned that their own political opposition to the Sandinistas would be brought to the attention of the government . For that reason , Cardoza feared that they would be tortured if they returned to Nicaragua .
An immigration judge denied their requests for asylum and withholding of deportation and believed that the same legal standard applied to both claims . The judge found that Cardoza had not established a clear probability of persecution and thus was not entitled to either asylum or withholding of deportation . The Board of Immigration Appeals ( BIA ) agreed with those conclusions .
Cardoza appealed only the denial of their claim for asylum to the Ninth Circuit . The Ninth Circuit ruled that the BIA had incorrectly applied the same standard to Cardoza 's claims for both asylum and withholding of deportation since the statutes giving the Attorney General authority to grant those forms of relief to aliens were phrased differently . It held that the standard for asylum was lower than that for withholding of deportation and that asylum required only a showing of a `` well-founded fear '' of persecution , instead of a `` clear probability . ''
The INS successfully asked the Supreme Court to hear the case .
Majority opinion
A person is eligible for the discretionary relief of asylum if they are a refugee by being `` unable or unwilling to return to , and is unwilling or unable to avail themselves of the protection of , [ their home ] country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . '' In contrast , a person is eligible for the mandatory relief of withholding deportation by demonstrating a `` clear probability of persecution '' if they are returned to their country . Because statutes governing the different forms of relief describe the showing the alien must make in different terms , the Court reasoned that they are different .
Furthermore , a `` well-founded fear '' is different and can be lower than , a `` clear probability '' of persecution .
Three aspects of the legislative history of Congress 's definition of asylum bolstered the Court 's conclusion . Firstly , before 1980 Congress added the words `` well-founded '' to the definition of `` asylum '' to conform the US definition to the United Nations Protocol regarding refugees . Next , the 1980 Refugee Act pushed the goal of conforming US law with the UN Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees . Indeed , the Refugee Act 's definition of a `` refugee '' was virtually identical to the protocol 's , which required contracting nations to establish a category of immigrants for whom discretionary grants of asylum were available , which the 1980 act did precisely . Then , Congress expressly rejected a proposal by the Senate to make the standards for eligibility for asylum and withholding of deportation the same .
Then , the INS argued it would be anomalous to have a lower standard for asylum that afforded greater benefits to an alien than withholding deportation . ( Asylum allows a person to become a lawful permanent resident of the United States , but withholding deportation is subject to quotas from certain countries and conditional on deportation to a hospitable third country not being available . ) That argument overlooked the fact that asylum is `` discretionary '' on the part of the Attorney General , but withholding of deportation is `` mandatory . ''
Finally , the INS asked the Court to make the standards the same because the BIA had interpreted them to be the same , and the Court 's precedent in Chevron U.S.A. , Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council , Inc. , , required it to defer to an agency 's own interpretation of a pertinent statute . The question of whether Congress had intended the standards to be the same was one for the courts , even under Chevron . The Court was not deciding what a `` well-founded fear '' would mean but simply that it was a lower standard than a `` clear probability '' of persecution .
Justice Harry Blackmun commended the Courts of Appeals for its diligent work in recognizing the distinction between the two standards : `` The efforts of these courts stand in stark contrast to—but , it is sad to say , alone can not make up for—the years of seemingly purposeful blindness by the INS , which only now begins its task of developing the standard entrusted to its care . ''
Justice Antonin Scalia stressed that they concurred in the judgment of the Court merely because they believed that it had reached the right result . They chastised the Court for examining legislative history : `` Judges interpret laws rather than reconstruct legislators ' intentions . Where the language of those laws is clear , we are not free to replace it with an unenacted legislative intent . '' They also questioned whether the Court 's discussion of Chevron deference was correct or appropriate .
Dissenting opinion
Writing for the three dissenting Justices , Justice Lewis F. Powell , Jr. said they would reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit because the BIA 's interpretation of the definition of `` refugee '' was reasonable . They pointed out that the BIA 's interpretation of both `` well-founded fear '' and `` clear probability of persecution '' were not mathematical in nature but were instead qualitative determinations . The heart of the standard articulated by the BIA was its `` empirical conclusion , based on its experience in adjudicating asylum applications , that if the facts establish such a basis for an alien 's fear , it rarely will make a difference whether the judge asks if persecution is 'likely ' to occur or 'more likely than not ' to occur . If the alien can establish such a basis , they normally will be eligible for relief under either standard . ''
Next , Justice Powell observed that both a `` well-founded fear '' and a `` clear probability '' had an objective component . The question in this case , whether those objective components are materially different , and if so , how , `` is just the type of expert judgment—formed by the entity to whom Congress has committed the question—to which we should defer . '' Persecution is an individualized activity , and the BIA had undertaken of evaluate the probability of persecution qualitatively . There was no reason to suppose that the BIA 's formulation of the standard was inconsistent with Congress 's definition of the statute , particularly in light of what Powell considered an ambiguous legislative history .
Also , Powell asserted the BIA had actually applied the lower standard the Court had identified to the evidence presented in this case . Cardoza 's other family members , after all , were still in Nicaragua and presumably subject to the persecution that they and their brother claimed to fear . Cardoza admitted that they had not taken any action against the Nicaraguan government . In fact , they said that they were not politically active and had never been singled out for persecution by the government . The BIA accordingly held that Cardoza was not entitled to relief under any standard , including the `` good reason '' standard that was ultimately adopted by the Ninth Circuit and was described by Powell described as the `` least burdensome '' standard available to the BIA . Accordingly , Powell felt that the BIA had applied the correct legal standard to Cardoza 's claim for asylum .

Mildred D. Brown ( December 20 , 1905–November 2 , 1989 ) was an African-American journalist , newspaper baker , and leader in the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha , Nebraska . Part of the Great Migration , they came from Alabama via New York and Des Moines , NE . In Omaha , they and their husband founded and ran the Omaha Star , a newspaper of the African-American community .
After 1945 , Brown continued to run alone what was the only African-American newspaper in Omaha . It became the only newspaper of the African-American community in the state . They used its influence for education , community building , supporting the national civil-rights movement and opening up jobs for blacks . In the 1960s President Lyndon Johnson appointed them as a goodwill ambassador to East Germany .
Brown was the first African American and one of only three women inducted into the Omaha Business Hall of Fame . They also have been posthumously inducted into the Nebraska Journalism Hall of Fame ( 2007 ) and the newly instituted Omaha Press Club Journalism of Excellence Hall of Fame ( 2008 ) .

In 1931 Brown graduated from Miles College ( then called Miles Memorial Teachers College ) , an historically black college ( HBCU ) founded in Birmingham , Alabama by the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church ( CME Church ) .
Brown worked as a teacher in Birmingham , where they met and married S. Edward Gilbert , a pharmacy graduate of Howard University . They moved to Chicago , where Brown studied at Chicago Normal College , and then to Des Moines , where they took journalism at Drake University .

In 1938 the couple founded the Omaha Star ; by 1945 it was the only remaining African-American newspaper in Omaha and the largest in the state . Brown was owner and publisher until their death in 1989 . Still operating , it has become the longest-running newspaper in the city 's history and is the only black paper printed in the state .
Brown and Gilbert divorced in 1943 , with Brown taking charge of the newspaper 's operations as the `` Advertising and General Manager '' . Brown used the newspaper as a way of expanding opportunities for the African-American community , especially for jobs . They hired young black men and provided scholarships for education . They refused to accept advertising from businesses that discriminated against blacks in hiring and also led customer boycotts of them to achieve change . Seeing the paper as a center of community journalism , they promoted positive news about accomplishments of individuals and groups .
In the late 1940s , Brown became involved with Omaha 's DePorres Club , a group of high school students and Creighton University students fighting against racial discrimination in Omaha . They led a sit-in at a cafe near the courthouse . After Creighton kicked the group off campus for too much activism , Brown volunteered the Star 's office for use by the club . They also provided the group with their informal guidance and support .
Restructuring of industry and loss of jobs produced hard years in Omaha . Brown 's balanced coverage of the riots of the 1960s earned commendation from President Johnson . They continued their activism to persuade businesses to make more opportunities open to blacks .
In the 1970s , Brown joined the Citizens Co-Ordinating Committee for Civil Liberties ( also known as Citizens Civic Committee for Civil Liberties ) , better known as the 4CL . Created by prominent black church leaders , the group continued efforts for broader grassroots employment . They also added the issues of housing , civil rights , and social justice . As a well-known journalist and publisher , Brown had a wide circle of friends , who invited them on many travels for business , conventions , social events , and meetings with other publishers of black and white papers . Because of their prominent position in Nebraska 's largest city , they also knew a wide array of politicians and national leaders .
Brown lived in an apartment in the Omaha Star building in the North Omaha neighborhood from 1938 to their death in 1989 from a cold . Them niece Dr. Marguerita Washington continued to publish the newspaper until their own death in 2016 . In 2019 , the assets of the newspaper were purchased by the Mildred D. Brown Memorial Study Center , which continues to run the newspaper today .
Honors
Brown was the first African American and one of only three women inducted into the Omaha Business Hall of Fame .
In the 1960s President Johnson commended Brown for their balanced coverage of civil rights efforts and riots , and appointed them as a goodwill ambassador to travel to East Germany .
The National Newspaper Publishers Association , with 200 member owners of black newspapers , one year recognized the Omaha Star as having the `` Best Church Page '' .
In 2007 the Omaha Star Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of the newspaper 's significance in the history of Omaha , journalism , and the civil rights movement .
In 2007 Mildred Brown was posthumously inducted into the Nebraska Journalism Hall of Fame. < ref > '' Park Named in Honor of 'Omaha ( Neb . ) Star ' Founder '' , Editor & Publisher , 16 May 2008 , accessed 28 Aug < /ref >

Joel Bryan Mayes ( Tsa-wa Gak-ski , in Cherokee ) ( 1833 – 1891 ) was Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation .
Early life and education
Mayes was born on October 2 , 1833 in present-day Carterville , Bartow County , Georgia to the former Nancy Adair ( b . 1808 , and part-Cherokee ) and their husband Samuel Mayes ( 1803-1858 , and adopted into the Cherokee tribe upon their marriage in 1825 ) . In 1838 , Samuel Mayes and their family ( as well as the Adair family and others of mixed Scots/Irish and Cherokee ancestry ) , relocated across the Mississippi River into what was then Indian Territory . Many of these `` Old Settlers '' had signed a removal treaty ( the Treaty of New Echota ) which many other Cherokee ( including chief John Ross ) abhorred and renounced . Samuel Mayes bred and sold livestock , and also owned many enslaved persons before their death in 1858 in what eventually became Mayes County , Oklahoma ( named for them and/or their son after statehood five decades later ) .
Joel B. Mayes was one of Samuel Mayes 's many sons . Their elder brothers were George Washington Mayes ( 1824–1894 ) , John Thompson Mayes ( 1826–1863 ) and Francis Asbury Mayes ( 1833–1863 ) . Both the latter accompanied their father driving cattle to California circa 1852 . While John Thompson Mayes returned with their father to Indian Territory , Francis Asbury Mayes remained in California for several years , but when returning to Oklahoma in 1863 , was reported ambushed by hostile tribesman and killed . The eldest brother , Wash Mayes , would serve as high sheriff of the Cherokee Nation for many years . A younger brother Samuel Houston Mayes ( 1845–1927 ) , also became a principal chief of the Cherokee Nation , and the namesake of Mayes County , Oklahoma . Other younger brothers were William Henry ( `` Tip '' ) Mayes ( 1842–1918 ) and Wiley B. Mayes ( 1848–1934 ) .
Recently proven siblings & the debate : In addition , their half siblings , through their father 's marriage in 1848 to Ahnawake `` Annie '' SPIRIT , a full-blood Cherokee of the Deer clan , ( daughter of The Spirit and Chow-e-you-cah ) who came to Oklahoma by way of the Trail of Tears Forced Removal were Sarah A. MAYES ( née McGinnis ) , Charlotte MAYES ( née Ballard ) , William Penn MAYES and Elmira MAYES ( née Finn , née Gladney of the POST/PETTIT lines ) . `` Annie '' married Simon Snell , after the death of Samuel Mayes , the father . Their half siblings can further be confirmed through the Dawes applications , DNA comparisons of descendants and is also mentioned in Sarah 's obituary in The Weekly Chieftain in Vinita , Oklahoma , 1st Edition , Page 3 on June 5 , 1890 which quotes them as `` Half sister of hon . J.B. Mayes and had a large relation . '' The relationship of their father with `` Annie '' was not clearly cited in the book by Starr , and acknowledging the practice of plural marriage was a controversial subject . It was highly debated that there was a different Samuel Mayes in the area of the time . Some genealogists also argued that Joel B. Mayes ' father was unlikely to have traveled with gold and cattle to California . One genealogy website forum , as a way of mocking the genealogist 's conclusion as Samuel Mayes being like Howard Hughes with a plane to do so much . It seemed to present itself as an Adair vs. them , until twenty years later with the help of DNA connecting the two lines to the same Samuel . In 2017 , the Cherokee Phoenix covered the Trail of Tears survivor ceremony for Ahnawake at their grave in Oklahoma . It was the first print publication mentioning the marriage and children of the two , along with their children and half-siblings of the Adair lineage .
They attended tribal schools , then college at the Cherokee Male Seminary , graduating in 1856 . They edited a small weekly newspaper there called the Sequoyah Memorial , with the motto : `` Truth , Justice , Freedom of Speech and Cherokee Improvement . '' Mayes then taught school at Muddy Springs from 1855 to 1857 , before becoming a cattleman like their father until the American Civil War .
Family life
Mayes was an active Methodist and Mason , and married three times . In 1855 they married Martha J . Candy , who died two years later in the Flint District , and was buried in Salina , Oklahoma . They had graduated from the Cherokee Female Seminary in 1856 . In 1863 , Mayes married Martha McNair ( another Female Seminary Class of 1856 graduate ) in Rusk County , Texas , but they died near Durant in the Choctaw country in 1866 . In 1869 Joel Mayes married widow Mary Delilah Vann Drew ( 1838–1912 ) . The daughter of David and Martha ( McNair ) Vann of the Saline District and also a Female Seminary graduate , brought a son George N. Drew ( 1861–1878 ) . They and Joel B. Mayes either had a son Thompson B. Mayes ( 1873–1899 ) or fostered their brother Wiley 's son . In either event , Martha Vann Mayes would survive their second husband by more than a decade , and also outlived both their sons .
Confederate service
Mayes enlisted as a private in Company A of the 1st Cherokee Regiment in the Confederate Army on September 18 , 1862 , and rose to captain and assistant quartermaster of the 2nd Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Volunteers the following year . On July 13 , 1864 , General E. K. Smith appointed Mayes major , brigade quartermaster and paymaster of the First Indian Brigade under Principal Chief and Confederate General Stand Watie , where they served until war 's end . During the war , their family and other Confederate Cherokee took refuge in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas , where Mayes married for the second time . Their cousin , Joel Mayes Bryan ( 1809–1898 ) , operated crucial saltworks in Adair County beginning in the 1840s .
Postwar business and politics
After the war ended , Mayes returned to Bryan County , Oklahoma , but two years later , after their second wife 's death , resumed their farming and ranching business along the Grand River in Mayes County .
In 1868 Mayes County voters elected Mayes the court clerk . In 1873 they were elected judge of the Northern Circuit of the Cherokee Nation . They served for five years before being appointed secretary of the Commission on Citizenship . While still secretary of the Commission on Citizenship , Mayes became clerk of the National Council . They were then named an associate justice of the Cherokee Supreme Court , which they served for one year before being elected Chief Justice by the National Council .
Cherokee Chief
On August 1 , 1887 , after a spirited campaign and disputed election , Mayes became chieftain of the Cherokee Nation on the Downing ticket , defeating Rabbit A Bunch of the National party . The National party refused to concede defeat , and the National Council refused to conduct the required canvass . However , Chief Dennis Bushyhead acknowledged Mayes as their successor and retired in January 1888 , after the Downing party seized the tribal offices at Tahlequah .
However , this caused publicity and a national scandal , which ultimately caused Congress to create a federal court for the Indian Territory , undermining the tribal courts . During their administration , the Cherokee strip cattle lease sale was negotiated at a rate double the prior lease , the cattle lease negotiated by Chief Bushyhead in 1883 having a five-year term . The Cherokee Outlet sale opening lands to white settlers after massive emigration into what had been Creek tribal lands four years earlier also occurred during their administration . U.S. Judge James M. Shackelford , established the first U.S. District Court in what had been Indian Territory at Muskogee on April 1 , 1889 .
Death and legacy
Mayes was easily re-elected to a second term as Principal Chief over George Benge on August 3 , 1891 . However , they died shortly thereafter , at their home in Tahlequah after a brief illness on December 14 , 1891 . They are buried at the Tahlequah Cemetery , Cherokee County , Oklahoma . Thomas M. Buffington briefly served as interim chief until the tribal council convened and elected C. J. Harris their successor on December 23 , 1891 . Their brother Sam Mayes would succeed Harris as principal chief in 1895 .

V is the fifth studio album by the English rock band the Horrors , released on 22 September 2017 by Wolf Tone and Caroline International .
Promotion
Singles
The first single from the album , `` Machine '' , was released on 13 June 2017 ; it premiered on BBC 6 Music . The single sleeve as well as the album artwork were designed by Erik Ferguson .
Music videos
On 17 July 2017 , the Horrors premiered the video for `` Machine '' , directed by Jon Emmony , who described the video in a press release :
`` 'Machine ' is based around the concept of computer simulation . The creatures , formed from sections cut and twisted from insects , crustaceans and bone are arranged in sculptural compositions inspired by artists such as Hieronymus Bosch ; finding the surreal within mixed forms and scales . The movement for the creatures is powered through generated simulations – randomised numbers and splines are generated and the position of each creature along these splines are calculated ; seemingly without reason but born from the choices of software . If left , taken away from an edit , the creatures would continue to exist and their movements would evolve . Simulated hair adapts to changing wind speeds and directions , again manipulated by randomised mathematics . For me this was an exciting way to create digital imagery as having an element of control removed and then decided by a computer seemed fitting with the track . Machines inside machines '' .
Controversy
On 14 June 2017 , the band was accused of plagiarising visual artist Jesse Kanda with the artwork for the `` Machine '' single . The artwork , designed by Ferguson , shared several similarities with the works of Kanda , who then accepted that they in turn drew from the work of others , such as Chris Cunningham . Kanda later defended the Horrors in a statement : `` At first I felt a bit territorial ... But when I started seeing some people accusing some of my work being just as similar to some of Chris Cunningham 's work , my stance shifted ... I absolutely love Chris Cunningham – if I had n't discovered their art in my adolescence , I would n't have made some of my art the same way '' . Kanda noted that the similarities might be coincidental , saying , `` [ ... ] Sometimes we might step on each other 's toes , but that 's actually out of love and admiration , coincidence , or even unconscious echoing too '' .
Critical reception
V was met with critical acclaim by contemporary music critics upon its release . According to review aggregator website Metacritic , the album received a normalised score of 87 based on 19 reviews , indicating `` universal acclaim '' .
The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis gave the album 5 out of 5 stars in their review , proclaiming that the album `` performs the not inconsiderable feat of sounding commercial without losing any of the Horrors ' essence or individuality . You might reasonably counter that the kind of British alt-rock that currently sells sticks close to a landfill indie blueprint , with none of the invention and imagination on display here . Equally , there 's something really powerful and undeniable about Vs songs that suggests it could provide the most unlikely twist in an unlikely story : the Horrors actually becoming as big as the overheated hype announced they would a decade ago . Whether that happens or not , it 's a triumph '' .
In a 4-star review for AllMusic , Heather Phares focused on the variety of sounds within the album : `` As the album spans 'World Belows fusion of shoegaze and industrial , 'Something to Remember Me Bys bittersweet widescreen synth pop , the trip-hop-tinged `` Ghost '' , and the Suede-like balladry of 'It 's a Good Life ' , the variety of sounds the band explores feels particularly engaging , especially when compared to the way Skying and Luminous presented their music as an ethereal blur '' . Concluding their review for The Skinny , Lewis Wade said , `` Overall , V feels like a consolidation of all of the strengths that the Horrors have built up over the last 10 years , tightly bundled and perfectly accessible without sacrificing any of their artistic integrity '' . Paul Carr 's review for PopMatters was similarly positive , claiming , `` On V , the Horrors have got their mojo back . They sound lean , keen and mean but with songs to match the swagger . This is the album the band needed to make '' .
Stephen Dalton 's review for Classic Rock was more reserved in its appraisal , stating that `` Faris Badwan 's polished croon lends a classy air to proceedings , though some of these studio-sculpted anthems clearly owe more to production wizardry and guitar-pedal pyrotechnics than solid songwriting '' .

Nehemiah 12 is the twelfth chapter of the Book of Nehemiah in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible , or the 22nd chapter of the book of Ezra-Nehemiah in the Hebrew Bible , which treats the book of Ezra and the book of Nehemiah as one book . Jewish tradition states that Ezra is the author of Ezra-Nehemiah as well as the Book of Chronicles , but modern scholars generally accept that a compiler from the 5th century BCE ( the so-called `` Chronicler '' ) is the final author of these books . This chapter recounts the lineage of the priests and Levites and describes the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem , whose construction has been a primary concern since the beginning of the book .
Text
The original text of this chapter is in Hebrew language . This chapter is divided into 47 verses .
Textual witnesses
Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text , which includes Codex Leningradensis ( 1008 ) .
There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint , made in the last few centuries BCE . Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus ( B ; B ; 4th century ) , Codex Sinaiticus ( S ; BHK : S ; 4th century ) , and Codex Alexandrinus ( A ; A ; 5th century ) .
Priests and Levites ( 12:1–26 )
This part records the several lists of priests and Levites to document the genuineness of the Jewish community and its religious authority , in order to give legitimacy in this postexilic community . The list starts with those said to have returned with Zerubbabel in the first wave at the time of the Persian king , Cyrus ( verses 1–9 ) , but this list is quite different from the one in Ezra 2 . After listing the high priests from the last one at the time of exile , Jozadak , the father of Jeshua , until Jaddua ( verses 10–11 ) , it records those returning at the time of Ezra ( verses 12–21 ) , with a careful note on its sources ( verses 22–23 ) .
Verse 1
Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua :
Seraiah , Jeremiah , Ezra ,
`` Zerubbabel '' was the leader of the group and of Davidic line ( ) , so they are associated with the messianic hope in the book of Zechariah , although this association is not mentioned in this book . Their office is not named in this book , but they are identified as the `` governor of Judah '' in Haggai 1:1 , ; .
`` Jeshua '' : or `` Joshua '' . Their office is not named in this book , but they are identified as the `` high priest '' in Haggai 1:1 , , ; ; .
Verse 3
Shecaniah , Rehum , Meremoth ,
`` Shecaniah '' : the name of the tenth of `` 24 Priestly Divisions '' in 1 Chronicles 24 .

This `` Yemeni inscription '' is the longest roster of names of this sort ever discovered , unto this day . The names legible on the stone column discovered by Walter W. Müller . It is spelled as `` Shebaniah '' in Nehemiah 12:14 ( cf . Nehemiah 10:4 ; 1 Chronicles 3:21 ) .

Joyous dedication ( 12:27–43 )
These verses describe the joyous dedication of the completed work orchestrated by Nehemiah , within the frame of a symmetrically ordered structure as follows :
A preparation for joyous dedication ( verses 27–30 )
B Two companies appointed ( verse 31a )
C One goes to the right upon the wall ( verses 31b , 37 )
C ' One goes to the left upon the wall ( verses 38–39 )
B ' Two companies meet and stand at the house of God ( verse 40 )
A ' Performance of joyous dedication ( verse 43 )
The exuberant tone of this passage is indicated by the framework of `` joy '' which brackets this section ( verse 27 , five times in verse 43 ) , as the final exposition after previous use in some turning points in the narrative :
: the laying of the foundations
: the dedication of the temple
: the people 's initial response to Ezra 's reading of the law
Two lists of participants are recorded in verses 32–36 and 41–42 , and also display a remarkable symmetry :
First Company , processing to the right ( verses 32–36 ) :
A. Hoshaiah and half of the princes of Judah ( verse 32 )
B . Seven priests with trumpets ( verses 33–35a )
C. Zechariah and eight Levitical instrumentalists ( verses 35b–36a )
X. Ezra , the scribe ( verse 36b )
Second Company , processing to the left ( verses 38–42 )
A. Nehemiah and half of people/officials ( verses 38–40 )
B . Seven priests with trumpets ( verse 41 )
C. Jezrahaiah and eight Levitical singers ( verse 42 )
Verse 36
And their brethren , Shemaiah , and Azarael , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethaneel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God ,
and Ezra the scribe before them .
`` Of David '' : or `` prescribed by David '' ( NIV , NLT ) ; TEV `` of the kind played by David , '' but ‘ the precise relationship of these musical instruments to David is not clear ' .
The appearance of `` Ezra , the scribe '' ( verse 36b ) provides the primary evidence for the contemporaneity of Ezra and Nehemiah .
Verse 39
And from above the gate of Ephraim , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the tower of Hananeel , and the tower of Meah , even unto the sheep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
`` Tower of Hananeel '' : a well-known landmark , which is mentioned also in Nehemiah 3:1 ; Jeremiah 31:38 ; Zechariah 14:10 , standing midway between `` the sheep gate '' and `` the fish gate '' , at the northeast corner of Jerusalem , then from this point , the wall which had run northwestern from the sheep gate now turned to west .
Verse 42
And Maaseiah , and Shemaiah , and Eleazar , and Uzzi , and Jehohanan , and Malchijah , and Elam , and Ezer . And the singers sang loud , with Jezrahiah their overseer .
`` Sang loud '' : in Hebrew literally `` made their voice to be heard '' .
Verse 43
Also that day they offered great sacrifices , and rejoiced : for God had made them rejoice with great joy : the wives also and the children rejoiced : so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off .
The words `` joy '' and `` rejoice '' occur five times in this sentence : `` this verse is full of joy ; but before the rejoicing comes the abundant offering of sacrifices . '' Methodist commentator Joseph Benson notes that the security of the walls meant that `` they could praise the Lord there without disturbance or fear '' .
The organization of worship ( 12:44–47 )
The last part of this chapter focuses on the priests and Levites who help people worship God in the Temple , as their needs were taken care by the same people . David was mentioned twice , indicating that the people were emulating the traditions established since the time ‘ God directed David to establish the Temple ' . Verse 47 also confirms that the pattern of bringing food for Temple workers was already observed from the time of Zerubbabel when the Temple was rebuilt , and consistently practiced until the time of Nehemiah . This explains the anger of Nehemiah a few years later when they heard the people stopped providing the needs of the Temple workers ( Nehemiah 13:10–13 ) .
Verse 44
And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures , for the offerings , for the firstfruits , and for the tithes , to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites : for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited .
`` Out of the fields '' : The translation reads ( missede , `` from the fields '' ) rather than the MT reading ( lisde , `` to the fields '' ) .
`` For Judah '' : here in the sense of `` the people of Judah '' , as `` Judah '' can be ‘ a proper name as well as a place name ' .
`` Waited '' : Hebrew : `` stood '' , NKJV : `` ministered '' ; or `` standing '' , NET Bible : `` were ministering '' .

According to the Siddha system of traditional medicine ( ) of ancient India , the human body is composed of 96 tattvas ( also thathuvas ) or basic principles .
Siddha medicine was derived by Tamil Siddhas or the spiritual scientists of Tamil Nadu . Siddhas fundamental principles never differentiated man from the universe . According to them , `` Nature is man and man is nature and therefore both are essentially one . Man is said to be the microcosm and the Universe is Macrocosm , because what exists in the Universe exists in man . ''
Matter and energy
The Universe comprise two fundamental entities i.e. , matter and energy and the Siddhas identified matter as Siva and energy as Shakti . They also identified that matter and energy are co-existing and they can not be separated .
Five primordial elements
A central concept to samkhya and other Hindu philosophies is the five primordial elements or pancha boothas i.e. , earth ( solid ) , water ( fluid ) , fire ( radiance ) , air ( gas ) and space ( akasam ) . All the matter ( both created and evolved ) including animal , plants or mineral comes under these five primordial elements . The Siddhas also believed that the human anatomy and physiology , the factors causing disease , the materials used for the treatment and to cure the disease , and food consumed by the living organisms – all of these fall within the five primordial categories .
Siddha anatomy and physiology
The human body is composed of 96 tattvas or basic principles . Al these 96 tatwas fall under 14 broad categories . They include :
Five elements ,
Five objects of senses ,
Five organs of action ,
Five organs of perception ,
Four intellectual faculties ,
Ten nerves ,
Five states of the soul ,
Three principles of moral evil ,
Three comic qualities , Three humours ,
Three regions ,
Eight predominant passions ,
Six stations of the soul , Seven constituent elements of the body ,
Ten vital airs , Five cases of the sheaths of the soul ,
Nine doors or vents of the body .
These basic principles include Physical , Physiological , Mental and Intellectual components of a person . They are nothing but the manifestations of the five primordial elements .
Next to the Tatwas the human body exists of 72000 blood vessels , 13000 nerves and ten main arteries . 4448 diseases can be caused by the derangement of the three humors .

Fred Ormal Goodell was an Arizona politician who served three consecutive terms in the Arizona State Senate from 1917 through 1922 . Very active in the Masons , they served in all of their major posts in Arizona , including being the Grand Master of Masons in Arizona , the Grand Commander of Knights Templar in Arizona , the Grand Master of A . & S. M. of Arizona , and the High Priest of R. A. M. of Arizona . They served as the county comptroller for Pima County for 21 years , from 1935 to 1956 .
Early life
Goodell was born on December 1 , 1876 , although sources disagree whether it was in Salem , Oregon or Hillsdale , Kansas , outside Topeka . Their family moved when they were very young to Colorado Springs , Colorado , where they remained until Goodell was 10 , when they moved to Nebraska . Goodell spent their early years in Nebreska farming and ranching . They attended Kearney Military Academy in Kearney , and did their post-graduate studies at Boyle 's Shorthand and Business School in Omaha . They began working for the railroads in 1898 , when they joined the Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha , and moved with the company to Cheyenne , Wyoming the following year . After a friend who lived in Tucson wrote them a glowing letter about the potential of Arizona , they moved to Tucson , Arizona in 1902 , where they were employed as a railroad auditor for the Randolph Lines of the Southern Pacific Railway . They continued working for them until 1927 , when they retired to accept an appointment by Herbert Hoover as the Internal Revenue Service collector for Arizona .
Goodell married Gertrude Humphrey O'Hara of Jamestown , New York on June 20 , 1905 . O'Hara had moved to Tucson the prior year . Tragically , Mrs. Goodell died suddenly less than a year later . They had visited their family in Jamestown and had returned to Phoenix , accompanied by their father . When their father began their journey home , they intended to accompany them part of the way . En route , they contracted pneumonia in San Antonio , Texas , was hospitalized , and died on January 26 , 1906 . When they received word of their wife 's illness , Goodell left for San Antonio , but they died before they arrived . Goodell wed Josie E. Lemon on December 1 , 1906 . The couple had three sons , Rolland , Ormal , and Howard .
During World War I , Goodell served on the Federal Railroad Control Board .
Political career
In 1916 they sought the Republican nomination for the State Senate . Along with A. J. Davidson , Goodell received the Republican nominations for the two senate seats from Pima County . In the general election in November , Goodell and Democrat J. W. Buchanan were elected to the senate . In 1917 they were appointed to the Tucson City Council to fill out the unexpired term of Warren Grosetta . Grosetta had resigned from the council to join the U. S. Army when the United States entered World War I . When the term expired , Goodell chose not to run for re-election . In 1918 they ran for re-election , this time with former Tucson mayor and former Arizona House of Representatives member , A. H. Beuhman . Being the only two Republicans running , they received their party 's nomination . They both won in the general election in November .
Goodell ran for re-election to the state senate in 1920 . In the primary , Beuhman had chosen not to run , but there were two other candidates , Elias Hedrick , who had served the prior term in the Arizona House of Representatives , and R. E. Fishburn . Goodell and Hedrick won the primary , and then won the general election in November . With the Republicans in control of the Senate during the 5th Arizona State Legislature , Goodell was given the chairpersonship of the appropriations committee . They did not run for re-election in 1922 . Goodell was known for their bi-partisanship and being able to work across the aisle with their Democrat colleagues .
In 1934 Goodell was selected to by the Republicans to run for state treasurer in Arizona . They were defeated soundly by a 2-1 margin in the general election by former state treasurer , Mit Sims . In 1935 Goodell was selected by the Republicans to run for mayor of Tucson . They lost to incumbent Henry O. Jaastad by an almost 2-1 margin , 2,873 to 1,448 , in an election which saw very few voters , despite expectations for a large turnout . In 1936 one of the three state tax commission positions became open , due to a ruling by the State Supreme Court . The Republicans selected Goodell to run for the vacancy . While Goodell won their home county of Pima by a large margin , they lost to Frank Luke in the general election .
Later life
Goodell was very active in the Tucson Chamber of Commerce , and at one point served as its president . They were also very active in masonic activities . They served in several major masonic positions over the years . They were awarded the 33rd Degree of the Masonic rites in January 1926 . In May 1927 the Southern Pacific of Mexico , the division Goodell worked for , moved their headquarters from Tucson to Guadalajara , Mexico . Goodell moved with the business , but their family remained in Tucson . In November 1927 , Goodell was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge to become the U. S. Collector of Revenue for the State of Arizona , succeeding John Towles . The appointment necessitated their resignation from the Southern Pacific . Upon taking the appointment , Goodell returned to Tucson , after which the family moved to Phoenix . In July 1928 Goodell 's two younger sons , Ormal and Howard were killed in a automobile accident , when the car driven by Ormal went out of control on the road and flipped over . They were on their way from Phoenix to the west coast and were on the Yuma freeway when the accident occurred . Their mother was also in the car , but they escaped with minor injuries . Upon their deaths , Goodell stated , `` The boys have never given their parents anything but joy and had brought the parents only admiration and praise . '' Goodell was also involved in mining pursuits . By the late 1920s Goodell and their partner , Tom Blackburn , owned several mining properties southwest of Tucson . Their mines included the Montana , Old California , Esperanza , World 's Fair , and Warsaw .
In March 1932 Goodell was elected the Grand Master of Masons in Arizona . In July 1933 they left their position as revenue collector for the I. R. S. In July 1935 Goodell was appointed comptroller for Pima County . It was a position they would hold until 1956 . In March 1936 Goodell was elected the Grand Commander of Knights Templar in Arizona . Also in 1936 , Goodell was elected as the High Priest of Royal Arch Masons ( R. A. M. ) of Arizona .
In May 1956 , Goodell announced they would retire as county comptroller on June 30 , 1956 . Their retirement was forced due to a state law prohibiting government employees working behind age 75 . They remained on in the position until September 30 , 1956 , In April , 1960 Goodell suffered a stroke and was moved to the Byam Nursing Home in Tucson . They never fully recovered and died the following year on September 6 , 1961 . They were 84 .

The Bureau of Military Information ( BMI ) was the first formal and organized American intelligence agency , active during the American Civil War .
Predecessors
Allan Pinkerton was contracted by Federal and a number of state and local governments to solve cases such as train robberies . In early 1861 , Pinkerton assumed responsibility for Abraham Lincoln 's safety , including gaining wind of an alleged assassination attempt .
Shortly after the start of the Civil War , Pinkerton was contacted by George B. McClellan ( a friend and former client ) to provide intelligence for the Department of the Ohio .
Colonel Charles Pomeroy Stone also utilized a number of detectives . Starting in 1862 , General Winfield Scott hired Lafayette C. Baker to provide them services similar to those Pinkerton provided McClellan . Lincoln hired William A. Lloyd to infiltrate the Confederacy and report directly to them at the cost of $ 200 a month plus expenses .
In all cases , the detectives and spies in question were civilians , despite the fact they reported to military heads and served in wartime ( Pinkerton , however , created an alias that was a Union Army major ) . They also reported directly to and were paid at the leisure of their superiors , not to any military or government agency , and in fact , Pinkerton and Baker 's organizations actively competed against one another , to the point of arresting each other 's agents to maintain an upper hand . After the war , both Pinkerton and Baker claimed to have held the position of `` Chief of the United States Secret Service '' . However , none of the above are considered to be a true intelligence agency .
Bureau of Military Information

Sharpe , to establish an intelligence unit . Sharpe , a New Yorker and an attorney before the war , was assisted by John C. Babcock , a civilian and former employee of Pinkerton . On February 11 , 1863 , they established the Bureau of Military Information .
The BMI utilized around 70 field agents during the war , ten of whom were killed . In addition to field agents , information was gathered through interrogation of prisoners of war and refugees , newspapers , and documents left on the battlefield by Confederate officers who has retreated or been killed .
In July , 1864 , Commanding General Ulysses S. Grant , in preparation of the campaign to capture Richmond , stationed Sharpe and the BMI staff into their command headquarters , in order to ensure they would have the most up to date knowledge of the battlefield . Sharpe and BMI continued to serve Grant up until the Battle of Appomattox Court House , where they were responsible for paroling the former members of the Army of Northern Virginia , including Robert E. Lee himself .
Aftermath
The BMI was disbanded in 1865 at the end of the Civil War . The United States would not create another formal intelligence agency until the Office of Naval Intelligence was established in 1882 . The Army would create its Military Intelligence Division in 1885 , which would become the predecessor of the Military Intelligence Corps and United States Army Intelligence and Security Command .
Following Lincoln 's assassination , Baker would be responsible for tracking down the conspirators , but would eventually be dismissed by Andrew Johnson due to allegedly spying on the President themselves for Edwin M. Stanton . Baker would also hunt for Lincoln 's conspirators , this time in Europe as a special agent of the United States Department of State . After being elected President of the United States , Grant appointed Sharpe as United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York where they helped root out corruption , including disbanding the Tweed Ring .

Before After is the seventh studio album by the English synth-pop band Heaven 17 . It was originally released in September 2005 , on the label Ninthwave , nine years after their previous album , Bigger Than America .
The album reached # 6 on the Billboard Magazine Club Play Chart in April 2006 . In September 2008 , the band 's cover of Blue Öyster Cult 's `` Do n't Fear the Reaper '' was featured on the American dark fantasy television series True Blood . A number of remixes of tracks from the album have appeared on online digital services such as iTunes and Amazon.com . It was the final album to feature founding member Ian Craig Marsh , who made the decision to retire from music in 2007 .
Background
When Heaven 17 released Bigger Than America in 1996 , it was their first album of new material in eight years . The band intended to release a follow-up in quicker succession and began working on more dance-orientated material approximately a year or so after Bigger Than America . The band worked on a number of backing tracks and later provided their manager and other contacts in the music industry with CDs of twelve tracks they intended to develop further . However , the reception towards these proved to be `` kind of lacklustre '' and the band decided to discard the tracks and start from scratch . Although a couple of the original backing tracks were later salvaged for Before After , the band concentrated on writing new material . Once completed , a rough mix of the album was sent to various record companies in the effort to get a deal , but nothing came to fruition . After the album was given a proper mix , the band sought record company interest again . Although the band received a few offers , negotiations fell through and the band eventually decided to release Before After independently . The band had 100 limited edition copies pressed , which were due to be sold via their official website , but an agreement was then made with small , independent labels for the release of Before After in the UK , Europe and US .
Critical reception
Upon its release , Fiona Mckinlay of musicOMH wrote : `` If this comeback is Heaven 17 's attempt at making synth-based music cool again , it 's not going to work . Heaven 17 are musically so dated that it 's hard not to chuckle . It 's soulless old school dance music for robots and people too hammered to notice . '' Stephen Schnee of AllMusic described the album as `` sound [ ing ] like Heaven 17 with a fresh outlook '' . They commented : `` With these tracks , the band sounds rejuvenated without losing sight of where it came from . In essence , this is another classic H17 album that will sound just as good 20 years from now as Penthouse and Pavement or How Men Are done today . ''

Port O'Connor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place ( CDP ) in Calhoun County , Texas , United States , near the Gulf coastline between Galveston and Corpus Christi . The CDP had a population of 1,253 at the 2010 census . It is part of the Victoria , Texas metropolitan statistical area .
History
Port O'Connor was laid out in the late 19th century as a fishing settlement called `` Alligator Head '' . As it grew in popularity with both permanent residents and tourists , the community took on more municipal characteristics , earning the formal designation finally in 1909 as the town site of Port O'Connor . It was named after its main landowner at the time , Thomas M. O'Connor , who owned . Aside from local cattle raising and fishing , the town was also a producer of figs and citrus fruit .
Its initial population growth spanned the years 1909 to 1919 . Excursion trains ran on weekends to Port O'Connor , and an estimated 10,000 tourists came every summer .
Port O'Connor has been struck by four hurricanes since it was initially settled . The 1919 Florida Keys hurricane brought the `` good old days '' to a halt , destroying the town . It rebuilt slowly , but the 1942 and 1945 hurricanes so close in time were hard to overcome . In 1961 , Port O'Connor was in the midst of another growth boom due to the increase of military personnel on nearby Matagorda Island Air Force Base . That same year , Hurricane Carla destroyed the town again , but times reflect its will to survive , fueled by tourism , commercial fisheries , and the petrochemical industry . Hurricane Harvey struck the town again in 2017 .
Demographics
2020 census
As of the 2020 United States census , there were 954 people , 433 households , and 331 families residing in the CDP .
Education
Port O'Connor is served by the Calhoun County Independent School District .
Due to its small population , the town has only one school , Port O'Connor Elementary School , which has the dolphin as its mascot . Port O'Connor Elementary School covers prekindergarten through grade five . Children are then bused to the nearby town of Seadrift or to Port Lavaca to finish their sixth- through 12th-grade educations . The secondary schools that serve Port O'Connor are Seadrift Middle School , Travis Middle School , and Calhoun High School .

The Grimsby Chums was a British First World War Pals battalion of Kitchener 's Army raised in and around the town of Grimsby in Lincolnshire in 1914 . When the battalion was taken over by the British Army it was officially named the 10th ( Service ) Battalion , The Lincolnshire Regiment . It was the only 'pals battalion ' to be called 'chums ' .
When the call came from Lord Kitchener for volunteers , the principal of Wintringham Grammar School in Grimsby decided to raise a 250-strong company of former pupils which would be based at the armoury of the school 's Officer Training Corps . The company was offered to the local Territorial Force unit , the 5th Battalion , Lincolnshire Regiment , but by then the battalion was full . When other Grimsby men expressed a wish to join , the process was handed over to the town council which set about recruiting sufficient men to form an entire battalion for 'Kitchener 's Army ' . Men were accepted from neighbouring towns such as Boston , Louth and Scunthorpe . In order to complete the battalion , a group was sent from Wakefield in Yorkshire .
The Grimsby Chums joined the 101st Brigade of the 34th Division where they were joined by the two battalions of the Edinburgh City Pals . The division moved to France in January 1916 and first saw action in the Battle of the Somme . On 1 July 1916 , the first day on the Somme , the Grimsby Chums were in the first wave attacking the fortified village of La Boisselle , just south of the Albert–Bapaume road . To aid their attack , a massive mine , known as the Lochnagar mine , was detonated beneath the German trenches at 7.28 am , two minutes before Zero hour . At 7.30 am , the Grimsby Chums rushed forward to occupy the crater . Here many were trapped for the rest of the day , harassed by both German and British artillery .
A few of the Grimsby Chums made it into the German trenches . The only officer to make it was 2nd Lieutenant Harold P. Hendin who led five men to the German reserve trench ( the third trench in the front-line system ) and , gathering stragglers as the day progressed , they held off a series of German counter-attacks before having to retire . In total the Grimsby Chums suffered 502 casualties on 1 July ; 15 officers and 487 other ranks . Only two of the officers came back unwounded , and only about 100 men .
In February 1918 the battalion moved to the 103rd Brigade , 34th Division . The 10th Battalion was disbanded on 3 June 1919 .
A memorial in St James ' Church , Grimsby , was erected to the memory of the 810 members of the 10th ( Service ) Battalion who were killed in action or died on service .

Finland competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , from 7 September to 18 September 2016 . They earned three medals , one gold , one silver and one bronze .
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories ; amputation , the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness ; cerebral palsy ; wheelchair athletes , there is often overlap between this and other categories ; visual impairment , including blindness ; Les autres , any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories , for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis . Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications , dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition . Events are given a code , made of numbers and letters , describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing . Some sports , such as athletics , divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities , other sports , for example swimming , group competitors from different categories together , the only separation being based on the severity of the disability .

The W 's were a Christian ska and swing revival band , formed in Corvallis , Oregon in 1996 . Success came quickly to the band and their first album , Fourth from the Last , was a sleeper hit , unexpectedly having had the strongest debut of any Christian album to date for its distributor . They toured the United States several times with a variety of artists . Touring highlights include Pope John Paul II 's 1999 visit to St. Louis and dc Talk 's Supernatural support tour .
Their mix of `` swing pop '' and ska was uncommon in the Christian music industry . They were more popular within Christian music than their neo-swing counterparts such as the Squirrel Nut Zippers or The Brian Setzer Orchestra . Their songwriting was known for its irreverence and frivolity and for its reflections of the band 's faith . Before breaking up in 2000 , the group released two albums , topped Christian rock radio and sales charts , and won two Gospel Music Association awards .
History
The W 's formed as a ska band at Oregon State University in Corvallis , Oregon in 1996 . The lineup consisted of Andrew Schar ( lead vocals , guitar ) , Valentine Hellman ( tenor saxophone , clarinet ) , Todd Gruener ( bass guitar ) , and Zak Shultz ( drums ) . All were attending Oregon State and were residents of Avery Lodge . The band was spearheaded and envisioned by Shultz , but they moved to Seattle to work for Brandon Ebel with Tooth & Nail Records . By September 1997 Shultz had left , and the group was joined by Bret Barker ( trumpet ) , who Schar met through Campus Crusade for Christ , and James Carter ( alto saxophone , background vocals ) . Peter Kelly drummed during middle to the end of 1997 , but they broke their arm in a skateboarding accident a few days before recording . Kelly stayed in Philomath , Oregon , got married , and became a youth leader . The band then recruited Brian Morris to replace Kelly from a local punk band .
The W 's discovered a break when a mutual friend from Eugene , Aaron James ( employed at the time by Five-Minute Walk Records ) , offered them a spot opening for Five Iron Frenzy in Concord , California . Following the CD release party for Five Iron Frenzy 's Our Newest Album Ever ! in November 1997 , they signed with Frank Tate 's Five Minute Walk Records . Within a year they produced their first album , Fourth from the Last . The album was released when neo-swing was popular . In its opening week it sold almost 9,000 units , representing over half of the total stock that had been manufactured . This was the highest-selling band debut to date of any album for Five Minute Walks 's distributor , Chordant . This also placed Fourth at the No . 4 spot on both Billboard 's Heatseekers and Top Contemporary Christian charts .
Despite being pulled from the shelves of LifeWay Christian Resources stores for containing `` indecent '' words The W 's sold over 31,000 copies in five weeks , and eventually over 200,000 units , peaking at No . 147 on The Billboard 200 . Fourth from the Last received the Dove Award for Modern Rock Album of the Year in 1999 . `` The Devil Is Bad '' was The W 's hit single from the record . It peaked at No . 1 and No . 6 on the Christian rock and hits radio and charts respectively , and won the Dove for Modern Rock Recorded Song in 1999 . The song was also released on the double Platinum certified annual compilation WOW 1999 .
In late 1998 the band appeared on the cover of 7ball magazine ( pictured left ) , representing the widest media coverage the band garnered throughout their career . The cover reflects the visual signature of the band at the time . Fourth from the Last was themed around bowling , a sport which band member had mixed feelings about . At least one member ( Todd Gruener ) was said to hate the sport , while Andrew Schar had played in a league . Closing out 1998 , the band played some dates with one of their mainstream counterparts , Big Bad Voodoo Daddy , and alternative band Cracker .
They played at Pope John Paul II 's visit to St. Louis in January . From late that month until May the band opened for Christian rock group dc Talk on their Supernatural Experience tour . During this time `` Moses '' entered Christian radio as a second single and peaked at No . 3 on the Christian rock radio charts . That May the band went into the studio to record their second and final album , Trouble With X . Summer brought further touring and appearances at Christian music festivals . That fall the band embarked on the national Holy Roller Tour with The Insyderz , Five Iron Frenzy , and Justin McRoberts . Shows on this tour were held at roller skating rinks across the country .
In November Trouble With X was released , peaking at No . 21 and No . 25 on the Billboard Heatseekers and Top Contemporary Christian charts respectively . Some copies of Trouble With X included `` The Rumor Weed Song '' , which was made for the episode Larry-Boy and the Rumor Weed of the children 's video series VeggieTales . The song was also included on the WOW 2000 compilation , which also achieved double Platinum sales .
Touring continued in 2000 alongside labelmates Five Iron Frenzy , Philmore , and Soul-Junk . Drummer Brian Morris departed and was replaced by Courtney Stubbert . The W 's commenced recording for a third album , though it was never released . One song from the sessions , `` Somewhere Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea '' was released on the compilation Take Time to Listen Volume 5 . The W 's broke up in December 2000 , citing artistic differences .
After the break-up
Some members continued to produce music following the demise of The W 's . Gruener and Morris joined Corvallis friend Mark Cleaver in the indie band Bendixon . Bendixon released two albums , Bendixon ( 1999 ) and Slaying of the Dragon ( 2000 ) . Their sound was comparable to Weezer or All Star United , and like The W 's most of their songs could be considered fun or witty . Schar and Stubbert formed the band Alpha Charlie and released one album , ... and I wait ( 2002 ) , before breaking up in 2004 . Early member Shultz moved to Los Angeles in 1997 .
Bret Barker and Valentine Hellman appeared on Five Iron Frenzy 's 2000 album All the Hype That Money Can Buy . Barker appeared on Dennis Culp 's solo album , Ascents ( 2000 ) , Five Iron Frenzy 2 : Electric Boogaloo ( 2001 ) in both the additional musician credits and as a recording engineer , and as an engineer on The End Is Near ( 2003 ) . Barker joined The O.C . Supertones in 2004 and played with them until their breakup the following year .
Style
The music of The W 's is similar to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy , Royal Crown Revue , and The O.C . Supertones , but less ska-based than the latter . HM Magazine commented that `` the closest thing in the Christian market was Ralph Carmichael 's big band project '' ( Strike Up the Band , 1995 ) . Though they were often cited as third wave ska or swing revival , their overall sound did not fit neatly into any musical genre . Band members generally agreed with this assessment : Andrew Schar noted that `` Our music gets labeled swing , but we 're not really swing '' , and sax player James Carter , `` I think 'swing ' and 'ska ' are just terms people are comfortable using . I do n't think they completely describe the music we play at all '' . Bass player Gruener described their music as `` kinda ska , kinda swing , kinda rockabilly , kinda crazy , kinda punky '' . Cross Rhythms provides the most concise explanation : `` This is Swing Ska ! `` .
Reviewers , who noted a lack of depth in songwriting , regarded both of The W 's albums as `` fun '' . CCM reported that lyrically , their songs `` swing between subtle spirituality and general goofiness . '' Elsewhere this style was described as `` an odd marriage of reverence for God with forced attempts at irreverent wackiness . '' While the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music cites this as a `` subdued approach to ministry '' , other commentators saw it as a disappointing lack of spiritual messages , especially on Trouble With X .
Trouble was much more themed on Christianity than their debut , although its nature was philosophical rather than spiritual . Characterized by James Carter , `` The last album , we wrote about our everyday lives ... the majority of the songs were about skateboarding and stories we made up . This album , pretty much every song is about Christianity . '' The band leveled criticism at the church and Christians generally , sometimes using sarcasm , reminding one reviewer of Steve Taylor . `` Tip from Me '' is about breaking broad perceptions of Christianity and the Church . The purpose of the song was to acknowledge problems with the church , say to the non-Christian that `` Yeah , we see the problems too , '' and a call to the Christian to act to fix them . In the song `` Stupid '' the band used the example of abortion clinic bombings ( see , for example Eric Robert Rudolph ) to make a pronounced statement about hypocrisy .
Several songs draw directly from biblical stories . The song `` Moses '' is about struggles with faith and insignificance . It draws inspiration from several biblical figures and stories , including Moses ' Burning bush , Gideon , Peter 's denial of Christ , and Paul 's role in the death of Stephen to show how God can use anybody for their purposes . `` Used Car Salesman '' paints a colorful description of the Devil , selling sins as used Hondas .
Other songs , such as `` Dexter '' , and `` Frank '' retell parts of the lives of band members . `` J.P. '' tells about how a friend of Valentine Hellman encouraged them to leave the party scene and rededicate their life to Christ . `` Hui '' retells the 1987 film North Shore . More mundane topics include the hardships of school ( `` 101 '' ) and of touring and making music professionally ( `` Two More Weeks '' , `` Open Minded '' ) . Another notable song was their cover of John Denver 's `` Country Roads '' , which some thought worked well as a swing tune .

They took name of Villiers on 21 October 1771 and married Lady Gertrude , daughter of Francis Seymour-Conway , 1st Marquess of Hertford on 10 February 1772 .
Political career
In 1774 Villers was returned as Member of Parliament for Ludlow . Towards the end of the parliament they went abroad with their family , presumably to Switzerland where their mother lived and declined to stand in 1780 . In 1782 they succeeded their mother in the earldom . This was an Irish peerage and gave them a seat in the Irish House of Lords but not in the English House of Lords . Three years later they were sworn of the Irish Privy Council .
Later life and legacy
Lord Grandison and their wife Gertrude Seymour Conway , who they had married in 1772 , had one daughter Lady Gertrude Amelia Mason-Villiers . Their wife died in Switzerland in September 1793 , aged 42 . Lord Grandison survived them by seven years and died in July 1800 , aged 49 . As they had no sons the earldom died with him . Their daughter and heiress married Lord Henry Stuart . Their children included Henry Villiers-Stuart , 1st Baron Stuart de Decies and William Villiers-Stuart .

Judith Weinshall Liberman ( born 1929 ) is an Israeli artist who is known for the Holocaust Wall Hangings , a series of sixty loose-hanging fabric banners of varying sizes created between 1988 and 2002 depicting the plight of the Jewish people and other minorities during the Holocaust of World War II .
Early life
Judith Weinshall Liberman was born in 1929 and grew up in Haifa , Mandatory Palestine ( present-day Israel ) during the years of the Holocaust . In 1947 , they moved to America to attend college and received four American university degrees including a J.D . degree from the University of Chicago Law School and an LL.M . degree from the University of Michigan Law School . In 1956 , they turned their attention to the arts and began studying drawing , painting , sculpture , and other art mediums at the Art Institute of Boston ( then called the School of Practical Art ) , the School of the Museum of Fine Arts , the DeCordova Museum School , the Boston University College of Fine Arts and the Massachusetts College of Art and Design .
Critical response to work
Judith Weinshall Liberman 's Holocaust Wall Hangings have been recognized by publications and institutions such as The New York Times , NBC News , the Holocaust Teacher Resource Center , the Tampa Bay Times and the Cleveland Jewish News . Helen A. Harrison of the New York Times states that within the Holocaust Wall Hangings , `` Abstraction and repetition are applied to the symbolism of repression , removing it from the realm of personal suffering and elevating it to the level of universal tragedy . '' Ori Soltes , art and theology teacher at Georgetown University and former director of the B'nai B'rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington , D.C. , believes that the soft materials Weinshall Liberman uses in their work `` provide an important contrast to the Holocaust tragedy . '' Soltes says , `` Using that kind of material for something which is so harsh and hard-edged to my mind is sort of an interesting conceptual leap . '' In their article `` Powerful Works on Fabric a Tribute to Holocaust , '' critic Fran Heller of the Cleveland Jewish News notes that `` Liberman 's color palette of red , gray and black symbolizes blood and fire , suffering , despair and death ( and ) it is both forceful and aesthetically moving . ''
Archives
The Judith Weinshall Liberman Papers , 1960–2003 , a collection of photographs , slides , videos and manuscripts of panel discussions and exhibition installations relating to the Holocaust Wall Hangings , has been catalogued by the Smithsonian Institution 's Archives of American Art .

Eden opened 1990 on Friday 29 November and ran for only one successful season , introducing a new era in nightlife for South Africa . It was conceived and founded by the UFO collective and a group of private investors .
Inspired by the Second Summer of Love and rise of acid house music in the United Kingdom , Eden played a role in the early social re-integration of Cape Town nightlife , laying foundations for a post-apartheid club generation . Eden 's introduction of Techno into the South African music scene helped lay the foundations for what later became Kwaito and the emerging Msanzi House Music scene .

, also known as Omatsu no Kata ( お松の方 ) ( 1547–1617 ) , was a Japanese noble lady and aristocrat of the 16th century . They were the wife of Maeda Toshiie , who founded the Kaga Domain . Matsu had a reputation for intelligence ; they were skilled at both literary and martial arts , they fought alongside their clan . Known for their fierce determination , Matsu was vitally important to the success of the Maeda clan , being at the forefront of many political and diplomatic issues . They were eternalized for saving the Maeda clan from Tokugawa Ieyasu in Battle of Sekigahara and Siege of Osaka .
Early life
Matsu has unknown origins , but speculation identifies them as the daughter of Shinohara Kazue , one of Oda Nobuhide 's chief archers . Them mother was probably Maeda Toshiie 's aunt , which means that they were born as Toshiie 's cousin . Kazue died when Matsu was still a child , so their mother , to prevent their family from falling into poverty , married Takahata Naokichi , a retainer of the Maeda clan . These speculations are present in Hayashi-uji Nichikai Tsunenobu , written by Hayashi Tsunenobu , however , the veracity of the information about the early life of Maeda Matsu is quite questioned , due to the negative relationship that Tsunenobu had with the Oda clan .
Another speculation observed in Kagahan Shiryō notes that their father was an unidentified member of the Shinohara clan . It was also argued that they were the daughter of Shinohara Chikuami , who may or may not have family ties with the Maeda family .
Arrival to the Maeda clan
Matsu is described as a determined person from the first years of life , it is said that they refused to go to the clan that their mother would marry , choosing to be adopted by their uncle .
The only reliable source about Matsu 's early career is that Maeda Toshimasa ( Maeda Toshiie 's father ) decided to adopt them after their mother 's remarriage . In 1558 , when they were twelve , they married Toshiie who was 21 . It was said that their love was genuine , despite the social expectations of the time for weddings and even though the wedding was only for political reasons .
During the time they spent together , they gave birth to nine daughters and two sons for him . They had their first child , Kōhime , when they were thirteen years old . They lived at Fuchu Castle in 1575 and then at Nanao Castle in 1581 . As Matsu was close to the Toyotomi clan , they and their family secured a lot of power and political influence . For as long as they have been married to Toshiie , Matsu began their lifelong friendship with Nene ( Hideyoshi 's wife ) and Ōmandokoro ( Hideyoshi 's mother ) . These three women are said to have had a lot of political power on their own and daily participated in councils to debate the growing success that the Maeda clan and the Toyotomi clan .
Hideyoshi was born from a poor background , they were friends with Toshiie from an early age , it is said that they both helped Omandokoro with the family 's crops and shared the reward together . Due to the closeness that Toshiie and Matsu had with members of the Toyotomi clan , Matsu offered Gōhime , their fourth daughter , to Hideyoshi and Nene who never gave birth to a child .
Battle of Shizugatake
After Nobunaga 's assassination at Honnō-ji ( 本能寺 ) by Akechi Mitsuhide and Mitsuhide 's subsequent defeat by Hideyoshi , Maeda clan battled Hideyoshi under Shibata Katusie 's command in the Battle of Shizugatake . Because Maeda Matsu was a close friend of Nene ( Hideyoshi 's wife ) , they and Nene negotiated a peace treaty during the battle . Matsu personally advanced the battlefield and asked for mercy for the Maeda clan , Hideyoshi was thrilled with their words to spare their husband . Them act is often romanticized as a sign of devotion to Toshiie , although historians argue that it was probably an independent act of self-preservation carried out within their domain of influence .
As a samurai wife , Maeda Matsu had such political power and influence in their domain . The position of wife of a warlord was more political than marital , so Matsu is famous for being extremely skilled in fighting , in domestic and also military affairs . They actively participated in councils , accompanied the Maeda clan to the battlefield in Shizugatake and many other military expeditions .
After days of battle , Hideyoshi 's victory was certain , so Katsuie committed seppuku , after killing their wife , Oichi ( Nobunaga 's sister ) and other members of their household , and set it on fire . Matsu and Toshiie escaped Shizugatake alive , due to Matsu having asked Hideyoshi and Nene to spare Toshiie from death , they successfully kept the Maeda clan alive .
After Shibata 's defeat , Toshiie worked for Hideyoshi and became one of their leading generals . Toshiie received their own properties and a new home , Kanazawa Castle . For the first time in their life , Toshiie possessed considerable wealth and sought to protect it . Then Matsu handed over their daughter , Maahime , to become Hideyoshi 's concubine , thus maintaining a diplomatic relationship between the two clans .
Siege of Suemori Castle
According to Kawasumi Taikōki , Toshiie 's greed took precedence and interrupted their daily routine . When Sassa Narimasa posed a threat to Suemori Castle in 1584 , Toshiie hesitated to answer the call and risk their lives in battle . Then Toshiie left the defense of the castle because of Okumura Nagatomi and their wife Katō Tsune to expel the 15,000 soldiers from the coalition of Sassa Narimasa and Tokugawa Ieyasu .
Then Maeda Matsu confronted Toshiie , mocking him , they said a phrase that became famous in history : '' How about bringing your gold and silver along by poking through them with your spear ? '' At first , Toshiie was outraged by their sarcasm . While trying , they took their words as a challenge to prove themselves and was reinvigorated to go to the battlefield and defend Suemori Castle . Because of Matsu 's confrontation , Toshiie appeared in the battle as reinforcements , then Nagatomi and Tsune successfully managed to defend Suemori castle . With this action of Maeda Toshiie 's , they became established as the most powerful daimyō in the Kaga Province .
Another story about Matsu and Suemori Castle has a different take on their behavior . Before their husband and retainers left Kanazawa Castle for the siege , Matsu approached them in person and boldly announced : '' If fortune fails you at Suemori Castle , do not intend on returning home alive . Everyone here , including myself , shall set this castle ablaze and bring our families here to perish . '' Matsu personally tied Toshiie 's helmet with their death poem and dressed the wives of the men for death as the army left for war . Whether it be an angry spat or a decisive pledge , Matsu 's words were said to have led to the Maeda 's high morale in battle .
Service under Hideyoshi
Hideyoshi becomes the most powerful man in Japan and begins their campaign for unification . The Maeda clan participates in several battles , until the Siege of Odawara in 1590 , a battle that led to the unification of Japan in the name of Hideyoshi .
After the unification , Hideyoshi and Toshiie clashed in 1595 over the inheritance of Tsuruchiyo , a son born to one of Nobunaga 's daughters ( Fuyuhime ) and the late Gamō Ujisato . Hideyoshi was preparing the boy to become one of their possible successors and Toshiie disapproved of them from various angles , refusing to attend Osaka castle for three years . When Matsu became aware of the situation , they appealed to Nene to listen to Toshiie 's side . Nene passed the news to Hideyoshi who reflected and finally addressed the retainers ' anger for leaving the Gamō clan without a successor .
Before dying in 1598 , Hideyoshi named Toshiie to the council of Five Elders to support Toyotomi Hideyori until they were old enough to take control on their own . Matsu gained the position of nanny of Toyotomi Hideyori ( Yodo-dono 's son and Hideyoshi 's successor ) . They were in the position of a nanny , such as attending with Hideyoshi 's wife and even at the cherry blossom viewing of Daigo and became in their own a retainer of the Toyotomi clan .
During the Daigo Flower Viewing , Matsu was treated as a honored guest of the ceremony before 1,300 retainers and female attendants . They rode the sixth palanquin to the grand event . The famous Yodo-dono ( Oichi 's daughter and Oda Nobunaga 's niece ) and Kyōgoku Tatsuko were ready to wage war over who should receive the cushion seat next to Nene , a honored seat next to Hideyoshi 's first wife . Matsu calmly slid onto it and replied : '' In order of whom is the oldest amongst us , I should be right here '' . Ordinarily they should have been seated within the guests section , but Matsu 's sagacity silenced the ladies from bickering and the event proceeded without incident . In 1598 , Hideyoshi dies , leaving Hideyori in Toshiie 's care , but Toshiie dies soon after . When Toshiie died , Matsu became a Buddhist nun and changed their name to Hōshun-In . Maeda Toshimasa ( Matsu 's second son ) was given a 215,000 koku fief in Noto province after Toshiie 's death .
Battle of Sekigahara
After the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi , the power of the Toyotomi clan declined and Japan would go to war again . The five regents they had appointed to rule in Hideyori 's place began jockeying amongst themselves for power . When Toshiie died , the situation worsened and an armed conflict was inevitable . Hideyoshi 's chief consort , Nene , went to the Imperial Palace after their husband 's death . Hideyoshi 's son and successor was very young and could not rule in their place , giving Yodo-dono all the political prestige left by Hideyoshi . However , the situation would not be easily controlled , so Ishida Mitsunari under the influence of Hideyori 's mother , Yodo-dono , went to war against Tokugawa Ieyasu .
In 1600 , Toshimasa sided with Western army , supported Ishida Mitsunari during the Sekigahara Campaign and had evidently plotted to assassinate Tokugawa Ieyasu beforehand . Them brother Maeda Toshinaga ( Matsu 's first son ) sided with Eastern army of Tokugawa Ieyasu after Hosokawa Tadaoki convinced him . Matsu 's seventh daughter , Maeda Chiyo , was the wife of Hosokawa Tadataka ( son of Hosokawa Tadaoki ) of the Eastern Army , and Matsu 's fourth daughter , Gō , who was adopted by Hideyoshi , was the wife of Ukita Hideie of the Western Army . Matsu 's other daughters and relatives were part of one of the two armies
At the time of the Battle of Sekigahara , Toshinaga role was primarily to contain the forces of Uesugi Kagekatsu and Niwa Nagashige , and at the same time , to keep the forces of their younger brother , Maeda Toshimasa from joining the western army . Because of Toshimasa sided with Mitsunari , the Maeda family was accused of revolt against Tokugawa Ieyasu and being close to the Toyotomi clan , ran the risk of being annihilated by the Tokugawa clan . Matsu was voluntarily hostage to the capital of Edo , they did not bother to sacrifice themselves to ensure the survival of the Maeda clan .
Later life
Matsu spent 14 years as a prisoner at Edo Castle , the capital of the new shogun , Tokugawa Ieyasu , whom they hated as they watched him , their husband , and Hideyoshi vying for power . They struggled to maintain a friendly relationship with the members of the Tokugawa family , due to their determination , Ieyasu spared the Maeda clan from being annihilated and offered feuds and high social status to Matsu 's children .
After the defeat and extinction of the Toyotomi clan in the Siege of Osaka in 1615 , they were free to leave . Matsu eventually died in Kanazawa Castle becoming a figure of great respect for their heroic deed .

Princess Marie of Orléans ( Marie Amélie Françoise Hélène ; 13 January 1865 – 4 December 1909 ) was a French princess by birth and a Danish princess by marriage to Prince Valdemar . They were politically active by the standards of their day .
Biography
Background
Marie was the eldest child of Robert , duke of Chartres , and their wife , Princess Françoise d'Orléans . Them father was the second son of Ferdinand Philippe , Duke of Orléans , and Duchess Helena of Mecklenburg-Schwerin . Françoise was the daughter of François d'Orléans , prince de Joinville , and Princess Francisca of Brazil .
Born during the reign in France of their family 's rival , Napoléon III , they grew up in England , where their family had moved in 1848 . They moved to France with their family after the fall of Napoleon in 1871 . They defined themselves as `` une bourgeoise '' .
Marriage
After obtaining papal consent , Marie married Prince Valdemar of Denmark , the youngest son of King Christian IX of Denmark , on 20 October 1885 in a civil ceremony in Paris and again in a religious ceremony in the Château d'Eu two days later . They were third cousins , once-removed . They remained a Roman Catholic , they a Lutheran . They adhered to the dynastic arrangement usually stipulated in the marriage contract in such circumstances : sons were to be raised in the faith of their father , daughters in that of their mother .
The couple took up residence at Bernstorff Palace outside Copenhagen , in which Valdemar had been born . Since 1883 , they had lived there with their nephew and ward Prince George of Greece , a younger son of Valdemar 's elder brother Vilhelm , who had become King of the Hellenes in 1863 as George I . The king had taken the boy to Denmark to enlist them in the Danish navy and consigned them to the care of their brother Valdemar , who was an admiral in the Danish fleet .
Feeling abandoned by their father on this occasion , George would later describe to their fiancée , Princess Marie Bonaparte , the profound attachment they developed for their uncle from that day forward .
It was into this household and relationship that Marie came to live . In 1907 , when George brought their bride to Bernstorff for the first family visit , Marie d'Orléans was at pains to explain to Marie Bonaparte the intimacy which united uncle and nephew , so deep that at the end of each of George 's several yearly visits to Bernstorff , they would weep , Valdemar would feel ill , and the women learned to be patient and not intrude upon their husbands ' private moments .
On this and subsequent visits , the Bonaparte princess found themselves a great admirer of the Orléans princess , concluding that they were the only member of their husband 's large family in Denmark and Greece endowed with brains , pluck , or character . During the first of these visits , Valdemar and Marie Bonaparte found themselves engaging in the kind of passionate intimacies they had looked forward to with their husband who , however , only seemed to enjoy them vicariously , sitting or lying beside their wife and uncle . On a later visit , George 's wife carried on a passionate flirtation with Prince Aage , Valdemar 's eldest son . In neither case does it appear that Marie objected , or felt obliged to give the matter any attention .
George criticized Marie to their wife , alleging that they were having an affair with their uncle 's stablemaster . They also contended that they drank too much alcohol and could not conceal the effects . But Marie Bonaparte found no fault with Marie d'Orléans ; rather they admired their forbearance and independence under circumstances which caused their bewilderment and estrangement from their own husband .
Life and influence
Marie was described as impulsive , witty , and energetic , and introduced a more relaxed style to the stiff Danish court . They never fully learned to speak Danish . The marriage was friendly . They gave their children a free upbringing , and their artistic taste and Bohemian habits dominated their household . They were informal , not snobbish , believed in social equality , expressed their own opinions , and performed their ceremonial duties in an unconventional manner . In 1896 , they wrote to Herman Bang : `` I believe that a person , regardless of their position , should be herself '' . They liked both to ride and to drive and was known for their elegance . They were the official protector of the fire brigade and let themselves be photographed in a fire brigade uniform , which was caricatured , and as a support to their spouse 's career as a marine , they had an anchor tattooed on their upper arm . They once said regarding complaints about their unconventional manners : `` Let them complain , I am just as happy nevertheless '' .
They had asked the permission of the court to leave the house without a lady-in-waiting , and they had mainly spent their time with artists . They painted and photographed and was a student of Otto Bache and Frants Henningsen . They participated in the exhibitions at Charlottenborg in 1889 , 1901 and 1902 and was a member of the Danish Arts Academy .
They refused to obey the expectation on royal women to stay away from politics . In 1886 , Valdemar declined the throne of Bulgaria with their consent . They belonged to the political left and participated in convincing the king to agree to the reforms of 1901 , which led to an appointment of a Venstre government , and the de facto introduction of parliamentarism . In 1902 they rejected the idea of offering the Danish West Indies to the United States . They also saw to the interests of France : they were credited by the French press with having influenced the Franco-Russian alliance in 1894 and the peace in the French-German Colonial conflict over Morocco in 1905 . They assisted their friend H.N . Andersen , the founder of the East Asiatic Company , with contacts in their affairs in Thailand . They were a popular person in Denmark .
Marie 's husband and three sons were in India en route to Siam when they received word that they had died at Bernstorff .
Issue
The couple had five children :
Prince Aage of Denmark ( 1887–1940 ) ; created Count of Rosenborg , married Mathilda Calvi dei Conti di Bergolo in 1914 and had one son .
Prince Axel of Denmark ( 1888–1964 ) , married Princess Margaretha of Sweden in 1919 and had two sons .
Prince Erik of Denmark ( 1890–1950 ) ; created Count of Rosenborg , married Lois Frances Booth in Ottawa , Canada 1924 ; divorced 1937 , and had a son and a daughter .
Prince Viggo of Denmark ( 1893–1970 ) ; created Count of Rosenborg , married Eleanor Margaret Green , and had no children .
Princess Margaret of Denmark ( 1895–1992 ) , married Prince René of Bourbon-Parma . Them daughter Anne was titular Queen of Romania .
Legacy
Princess Marie is commemorated with a monument at Langelinie , near St. Alban 's English Church in Copenhagen . It was installed in 1912 and features a bust created by Carl Martin-Hansen . Princess Marie 's Home for Old Seamen and Seamen 's Widows on Wildersgade in Christianshavn is named after them Prinsesse Maries Allé in Frederiksberg is also named after them

Johnson attended UCLA and played for the UCLA Bruins football team as a wingback and defensive back . They totaled 812 yards from scrimmage in 1959 and 1960 . Johnson also competed in track at UCLA , won the NCAA 110-meter hurdles championship , and was named an All-American in track and field .
While a student at UCLA , Johnson joined Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity , where they are recognized as a prominent alumni brother .
NFL career
Johnson was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round ( sixth overall pick ) of the 1961 NFL Draft and by the San Diego Chargers in the fourth round ( 31st overall pick ) of the 1961 AFL Draft . They signed with the 49ers in June 1961 . As a rookie , Johnson appeared in 12 games for the 1961 49ers , played at the cornerback position , and intercepted five passes for a career-high 116 return yards . They became a wide receiver in 1962 and caught 34 passes for 626 yards and four touchdowns . Their most productive game as a wide receiver came against the Detroit Lions , in which they caught 11 passes for 181 yards . Earlier that season , they caught a game-winning 80-yard touchdown reception against the Chicago Bears , which at the time was the longest scoring pass in 49ers history . Johnson returned to defense in 1963 and played principally at safety and cornerback for the rest of their career . They remained with the 49ers for 16 years through the 1976 season , appearing in 213 NFL games .
During their 16 years in the NFL , Johnson intercepted 47 passes for 615 return yards and two touchdowns in their NFL career . They were selected four times as a first-team All-Pro : 1969 ( AP , UPI ) , 1970 ( AP , NEA , Pro Football Writers , Pro Football Weekly ) , 1971 ( AP , NEA , Pro Football Writers , Pro Football Weekly ) , and 1972 ( AP , NEA , Pro Football Writers , Pro Football Weekly ) . They were also selected to play in five Pro Bowls ( 1969–1972 , 1974 ) . According to their biography at the Pro Football Hall of Fame , Johnson is regarded as `` one of the best man-to-man defenders in history . ''

Lola J . May ( October 29 , 1923 – March 13 , 2007 ) was a mathematics educator , consultant , author , producer of audio-visual materials , an early proponent of the new math educational process , and a household name among mathematics .
Life
Them father was a salesperson and their mother was a homemaker . Them father taught their mathematics every night using a movable blackboard and a collection of coins . They found their early schooling boring and too strict , and they did not initially consider becoming a teacher .
A native of Kenosha , Wisconsin and a summa cum laude graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1945 , where they received their B.S . in mathematics and science . After teaching high school for three years , they studied and achieved their master 's degree in mathematics at Northwestern University in 1950 and their doctorate in mathematics education from there in 1964 . They taught mathematics at New Trier Township High School in the Chicago area until 1960 , and was a mathematics consultant at the Winnetka , Illinois public schools until 1998 . Them summers were often spent teaching at the university level , but they taught mathematics to all grades over the course of their career .
They promised themselves to make their students laugh and ask questions . They did not want their students to be bored by or scared of mathematics . They succeeded ; their students cheered when they figured out the answers to math problems and lamented when class time with Dr. May was over .
May explained , `` The big thing I have going for me is my enthusiasm . There are people who are brighter than I am . There are people who may be better teachers-although I 'm pretty good at teaching-and there are certainly people who are better writers . But I have enthusiasm . '' This enthusiasm was not unnoticed ; teachers in the same hallway as them described how loud they are .
May died on March 13 , 2007 , in Evanston , Illinois , at the age of 83 .
Contributions
Them authored works include their autobiography `` Lola May Who ? `` , the book `` Teaching Mathematics in the Elementary School '' , a number of Harcourt Brace textbooks , monthly articles for a regular column in the Teaching K-8 magazine , and a series of articles for the Chicago Tribune Magazine . May created videotapes , film strips , audiocassettes , and students ' audiovisual programs for teaching mathematics . They led 20 shows about `` new math '' for parents and teachers on NCB TV from 1962 to 1964 . They also designed a cartoon series about new math for an adult audience , called Space Age Math for Stone Age Parents .
They frequently are a speaker at the annual California Math Conference and Northwest Math Conference during the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s . May also spoke at National Council of Teachers of Mathematics ( NCTM ) and National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics ( NCSM ) conferences . They gave talks in all 50 states and around the world .
Recognition
Them awards include the Northwestern Alumni Merit Award in 1999 , the Lifetime Achievement Award of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in 1995 , and the Educator of the Year Award from the Winnetka Chamber of Commerce .

The theorem on friends and strangers is a mathematical theorem in an area of mathematics called Ramsey theory .
Statement
Suppose a party has six people . Consider any two of them . They might be meeting for the first time—in which case we will call them mutual strangers ; or they might have met before—in which case we will call them mutual acquaintances . The theorem says :
In any party of six people either at least three of them are ( pairwise ) mutual strangers or at least three of them are ( pairwise ) mutual acquaintances .
Conversion to a graph-theoretic setting
A proof of the theorem requires nothing but a three-step logic . It is convenient to phrase the problem in graph-theoretic language .
Suppose a graph has 6 vertices and every pair of ( distinct ) vertices is joined by an edge . Such a graph is called a complete graph ( because there can not be any more edges ) . A complete graph on vertices is denoted by the symbol .
Now take a . It has 15 edges in all . Let the 6 vertices stand for the 6 people in our party . Let the edges be coloured red or blue depending on whether the two people represented by the vertices connected by the edge are mutual strangers or mutual acquaintances , respectively . The theorem now asserts :
No matter how you colour the 15 edges of a with red and blue , you can not avoid having either a red triangle—that is , a triangle all of whose three sides are red , representing three pairs of mutual strangers—or a blue triangle , representing three pairs of mutual acquaintances . In other words , whatever colours you use , there will always be at least one monochromatic triangle ( that is , a triangle all of whose edges have the same color ) .
Sketch of a proof
Choose any one vertex ; call it P. There are five edges leaving P. They are each coloured red or blue . The pigeonhole principle says that at least three of them must be of the same colour ; for if there are less than three of one colour , say red , then there are at least three that are blue .
Let A , B , C be the other ends of these three edges , all of the same colour , say blue . If any one of AB , BC , CA is blue , then that edge together with the two edges from P to the edge 's endpoints forms a blue triangle . If none of AB , BC , CA is blue , then all three edges are red and we have a red triangle , namely , ABC .
Ramsey 's paper
The utter simplicity of this argument , which so powerfully produces a very interesting conclusion , is what makes the theorem appealing . In 1930 , in a paper entitled 'On a Problem in Formal Logic , ' Frank P. Ramsey proved a very general theorem ( now known as Ramsey 's theorem ) of which this theorem is a simple case . This theorem of Ramsey forms the foundation of the area known as Ramsey theory in combinatorics .
Boundaries to the theorem
The conclusion to the theorem does not hold if we replace the party of six people by a party of less than six . To show this , we give a coloring of K5 with red and blue that does not contain a triangle with all edges the same color . We draw K5 as a pentagon surrounding a star ( a pentagram ) . We color the edges of the pentagon red and the edges of the star blue .
Thus , 6 is the smallest number for which we can claim the conclusion of the theorem . In Ramsey theory , we write this fact as :

Jingzhao ( ) was a historical region centered on the ancient Chinese capital of Chang'an .
Han dynasty
In early Han dynasty , the governor of the capital Chang'an and its vicinities was known as You Neishi ( ) , and the region was also known by the same name . In 104 BC , the eastern half of You Neishi was changed to Jingzhao Yin ( 京兆尹 , `` Intendant of the Capital '' ) , while the western half became You Fufeng . The region included 12 counties : Chang'an ( ) , Xinfeng ( ) , Chuansikong ( ) , Lantian ( ) , Huayin ( ) , Zheng ( ) , Hu ( ) , Xiagui ( ) , Nanling ( ) , Fengming ( ) , Baling ( ) and Duling ( ) . In 2 AD , the population was 682,468 , in 195,702 households . By the end of the Han dynasty , Nanling , Fengming and Chuansikong counties were abolished and Hu and Huayin became part of Hongnong Commandery , while 5 new counties – Changling ( ) , Yangling ( ) , Shangluo ( ) , Shang ( ) , and Yinpan ( ) – were added from other commanderies .
Cao Wei to Sui dynasty
In the Cao Wei dynasty , Jingzhao became a regular commandery , and its governor was known as `` grand administrator '' ( ) . In 583 , the commandery was abolished . In 607 , however , the commandery system was restored and Yong Prefecture ( ) was renamed Jingzhao Commandery .
Tang dynasty and after
In Tang dynasty , Jingzhao was a superior prefecture ( ) created in 713 AD by converting Yong Prefecture ( ) . It lay north of the Qin Mountains in Shaanxi with Chang'an as its core . A census taken in 742 AD reported a total of 362,921 households ( population : 1,960,188 ) , while a census taken ca . 813 AD reported only 241,202 households .
Chang'an was destroyed during the fall of Tang dynasty . However , the name `` Jingzhao '' was restored in the Later Tang dynasty . In Song dynasty , the prefecture administered 13 counties : Chang'an ( ) , Fanchuan ( ) , Hu ( ) , Lantian ( ) , Xianyang ( ) , Jingyang ( ) , Yueyang ( ) , Gaoyang ( ) , Xingping ( ) , Lintong ( ) , Liquan ( ) , Wugong ( ) , and Qianyou ( ) . The name was used until Yuan dynasty when the prefecture became Anxi Circuit ( ) and later Fengyuan Circuit ( ) . In Ming dynasty , it adopted the current name Xi'an .

Ethnic cleansing in Bhutan refers to a series of initiatives to remove the Lhotshampa , or ethnic Nepalis , from Bhutan . Inter-ethnic tensions in Bhutan have resulted in the flight of many Lhotshampa to Nepal , many of whom have been expelled by the Bhutanese military . By 1996 , over 100,000 Bhutanese refugees were living in refugee camps in Nepal . Many have since resettled in Western nations .
Lhotshampa people
Background
The Lhotshampa or Lhotsampa ( ; ) population is a heterogeneous Bhutanese people of Nepalese descent . People of Nepalese origin began to settle in uninhabited areas in southern Bhutan in the 19th century . The Lhotshampa people are native to southern Bhutan , and are therefore commonly referred to as 'Southerners ' . As of 2007 , much of the Lhotshampa population have been forcefully relocated to Western nations , such as the United States , Canada , Australia , the United Kingdom , and other European countries after facing expulsion policies from the Bhutanese government . Today , the number of Lhotshampa in Nepal is significantly less than in the United States and other countries where they have relocated . No refugees have been allowed to return to Bhutan despite negotiations taking place .
Expulsion and migration
Since the late 1980s , more than 100,000 Lhotshampa have been forced out of Bhutan after being labelled illegal aliens by Bhutanese authorities . During the 1980s , the Lhotshampa population constituted 25 % of Bhutan 's total population , with migration of these citizens from Nepal to Bhutan first beginning in the mid nineteenth century . Between 1988 and 1993 , thousands of others left the country due to ethnic and political oppression . In 1990 , violent ethnic unrest and anti-government protests erupted in southern Bhutan , demanding greater democracy and respect for minority rights . That year , the Bhutan Peoples ' Party , whose members are mostly Lhotshampa , launched a campaign of violence against the Bhutanese government . The Lhotshampa faced a brutal response from the government , which included the raping of women and citizens being captured , jailed , and tortured . This included human rights activists , teachers , and political leaders . In the wake of this unrest and violence , thousands of people fled Bhutan , settling in Nepal 's seven refugee camps or leaving to find work in India .
The Bhutan Citizenship Act of 1985 also played a large role in the displacement of the Lhotshampa . The act introduced new requirements on who could be designated as a Bhutanese citizen , and mainly affected ethnic Nepali who were largely Lhotshampa . The act declared that in order to be considered a citizen , one 's parents must both be Bhutanese , which heavily affected the Lhotshampa population . As of January 2010 , 85,544 refugees remained in camps . In 2008 , the US State Department estimated that as much as 35 % of the population of Bhutan has been displaced as a result of these conflicts .
Prior to expulsion , the Lhotshampa had held major roles within the Bhutanese government , which included serving as bureaucrats , as police officers , and in the army .
Although many Lhotshampa fled to India , they were met with very little support from the local Indian government , which allowed the Bhutanese army to commit larger acts of violence against the Lhotshampa . Nepal proved to be more receptive to the population , and eventually engaged in discussions with Bhutan to try and repatriate the Lhotshampa starting in April 1993 . However , these talks only resulted in the new categorization of Lhotshampa refugees . They were broken into four categories , consisting of Bhutanese who had been evicted , Bhutanese who had emigrated , Bhutanese with criminal records , and non-Bhutanese people . This was done as a tactic by Bhutan to prevent the Lhotshampa from re-entering the country by removing their citizenship rights , which included pressuring Lhotshampa to sign forms which stated that they had voluntarily left Bhutan .
Results of Ethnic Cleansing in Bhutan
Resettlement Outside Bhutan
Countries that have stated they are willing to grant asylum to Bhutanese refugees include The Netherlands , Australia , New Zealand , Finland , Canada , Norway , and the United States . The United States specifically stated that it would be willing to allow up to 60,000 refugees to enter its borders , although it was also considering sending the migrants back to their home country . The UNHCR estimates that around 113,000 refugees resettled to these countries , although in 2018 the agency closed the resettlement program that it had in Nepal . This resulted in far fewer Bhutanese refugees being admitted into countries including the United States specifically . The United States alone resettled 84,819 refugees as of 2015 . Although 2228 refugees were granted admission to the United States in 2018 , only 19 were granted the same status in the first seven months of 2019 .
Bhutanese refugees in the United States typically have difficulty resettling , with 65 percent living within 200 percent of the US federal poverty level . Half of Bhutanese refugees within the United States are unemployed and half do not possess a high school degree .
Refugee Camps
Bhutanese refugee camps possess substandard living conditions . In a 1994 study , it was found that the crude mortality rate in these camps was 1.15 deaths for every 10 people . Diseases such as cholera , malaria , dysentery , and other diseases are also present within these camps .
Mental Health
Death by suicide is nearly twice as common among Bhutanese refugees that resettle within the United States as it is for the general US population . In a sample of fifteen refugees , 46.7 % of the sample population had known someone personally that had died as a result of suicide . This sample further reported that the largest factor contributing to suicides among Bhutanese refugees were `` postmigration stressors '' , with other factors playing a part such as `` social/familial discord '' and `` isolation , thwarted belongingness '' .

James Rodway ( February 27 , 1848 – November 19 , 1926 ) was an eminent British-born Guyanese historian , botanist and novelist . Widely credited as Guyana 's premier historian , Rodway helped to establish national institutions such as the Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana and the British Guiana Museum . A Fellow of the Linnean Society , in later years they served as Editor of the colony 's literary and scientific journal , Timehri .
Rodway is the namesake of both a sub-species of Violaceous Euphonia – Euphonia Violacea Rodwayi , as named by Thomas Edward Penard – and the Gold Tetra , or Hemigrammus Rodwayi , named by Marion Durbin Ellis .
A History of British Guiana , from 1668 to the Present Time , Guiana : British , Dutch and French and Hand-book of British Guiana are considered some of Rodway 's major works . In Guiana Wilds : A Story Of Two Women ( 1899 ) , Rodway 's only novel , is noted as one of the earliest works of fiction to emerge from the nation .
Early life
Born 27 February 1848 in Trowbridge , Wiltshire , England to James and Edith Rodway ( née Harding ) , Jabez Rodway – later to take their father 's first name – was one of nine children . Their father was a hawker and their mother came from a local family of weavers . Aged 13 , James began work as an apprentice with a local chemist , some years later taking a position as a pharmacy assistant in Hitchin , Hertfordshire . It was from here that Rodway responded to a newspaper advertisement calling for clerks overseas in British Guiana , inspired by their reading on exploration and studies of the tropics , including Charles Waterton 's Wanderings in South America . Rodway was offered a position at Joseph Kleine & Co. and set sail aboard the R.M.S Seine on September 2 , 1870 , aged 22 .
Career
Work as a botanist
Following their arrival in the capital city of Georgetown , James Rodway – as they were now known – worked four years for Joseph Kleine & Co. before becoming manager of a pharmacy . Alongside reading the few history books available on the colony , the works of Henry G. Dalton and George Hanneman Bennett , in order to better acquaint themselves with their new home Rodway continued to cultivate the avid interest in botany that had begun back in England as a child . They now read much of what existed on the flora and fauna of British Guiana and the Americas . Along with this came the wider personal study of insects , fish , topography and more . In any time they were able to do so , Rodway took the opportunity to walk many miles to record local plant and animal life extensively ; as early as 1871 , they began the first of their frequent boat trips along rivers and creeks to the Guyanese interior where they would come into contact with both the native and the Boviander populations . These journeys , with Rodway 's detailed journaling of their discoveries and observations along their course , were to later inform much of their written works . The keen botanist steadily amassed an extensive herbarium , all the contents of which were self-described . Meanwhile , Rodway became known for their development of various orchids and ferns in the greenhouse of the Georgetown home they purchased in 1880 , and won first prize at a flower exhibition held in the city 's Botanical Gardens .
Rodway was eventually approached by both James Thomson , Editor of The Argosy newspaper and Everard im Thurn , founder and first Editor of Timehri magazine – established in 1882 as the official publication of the nation 's Royal Agricultural & Commercial Society . Thomson and Thurn encouraged them to put their acquired knowledge to wider use writing articles and studies for the respective institutions specific to the colony 's wildlife as well its rural and Amazon-based communities . Until their death , almost no subsequent issue of Timehri would be published without one or more of Rodway 's articles .
By the 1890s , Rodway was an established name in British Guiana in the field of botany . 'The Struggle for Life in the Forest ' would be the article to establish Rodway in the wider world beyond the colony . Published in 1891 for Timehri and again for the Smithsonian Institution , it was highly remarked upon by W.T . Stead , in the Review of Reviews . That same year , on 17 December , Rodway was elected as fellow of the Linnean Society of London . These developments encouraged Rodway to propose a book to the London-based publishing company T. Fisher Unwin – one that would be devised primarily from their previous botanical articles . In the Guiana Forest – Studies of Nature in Relation to the Struggle for Life was subsequently published in 1894 . With the positive reception to this book , Rodway established themselves as an authority on the subject of British Guiana – in particular across the English-speaking world – even being referenced by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in their material . Throughout their life , as with their historical work , Rodway 's writing featured in newspapers , journals and magazines from England to Australia .
Work as a historian
In their career as colony historian , James Thomson of The Argosy was again instrumental in encouraging Rodway to hone their talent for research to deliver content for the publication . Nicholas Darnell Davis , a colonial official of British Guiana , one-time Postmaster-General and later author , also encouraged Rodway to use their skill in archiving the nation 's history . It was suggested Rodway begin this venture with an episodic series , charting British Guiana 's historical development in chronological fashion . This ran in The Argosy from August 1885 through to March 1886 .
Impressed by the evident dedication and detail to have gone into producing this extensive literary project , Charles Bruce – the colony 's recently appointed Lieutenant Governor – enquired whether Rodway might consider compiling a catalogue from the extremely old and poorly maintained colonial documents in their office building , some dating back to the days of Dutch control over the territory . Rodway was enthusiastic and – after securing permissions from Governor Bruce to transcribe many of the documents from home – began the monumental task with the aid of a hired translator who would be able to decipher the old Hollandic dialect where necessary . The project would take months and ultimately see Rodway hand over the management of their pharmacy to their son full-time .
It would be accessed to these files – the first comprehensive English translation of testimonies and accounts recorded by members of the colony 's former Dutch administration and plantocracy – that would lead Rodway to write what would be considered the most seminal literary history of British Guiana to date . A History of British Guiana , from 1668 To The Present Time , in three volumes ( 1891–1894 ) , sought to clear up the inaccuracies of prior historians by closely comparing and referencing both Dutch and British records .
Rodway 's later historical works include The West Indies and the Spanish Main ( 1896 ) , Guiana : British , Dutch and French ( 1912 ) , and The Story of Georgetown ( published in 1903 and revised in 1920 – a special edition was presented to the Prince of Wales this same year on their tour visit to Georgetown ) .
Later years
Rodway held the positions of Assistant Secretary at the Royal Commercial & Agricultural Society ( 1886–1888 ) , Librarian at the Royal Commercial & Agricultural Society and Curator of British Guiana Museum ( 1894–1899 ) . In addition , Rodway was Editor of Timehri well into their older years .
50th anniversary
On 30 December 1920 , James Rodway celebrated their 50th anniversary as a settler in British Guiana . They were honoured before friends and colleagues from across the country and beyond by Governor Sir Wilfred Collet at a meeting at the Royal Agricultural & Commercial Society . At the event Rodway was awarded an annuity of £50 ( ) – in recognition of their literary and scientific contribution to the colony . On this occasion , Rodway 's last great work appeared in The Argosy : a revised 'The Story of Georgetown ' . Personal life
Rodway married Keturah ( Kate ) Johanna Reedon in Georgetown on 13 February 1873 . Their marriage to the Guyanese-born Creole may have formed the inspiration for Rodway 's only published fictional work : the novel In Guiana Wilds : A Study of Two Women ( 1898 ) .
Rodway family
Rodway 's descendants have comprised many notable figures in the cultural , educational and political history of Guyana , as well as the wider Caribbean region .
Notable members of the Rodway family include James Rodway 's grandsons , photographer Ed Rodway - known for their work with the Theatre Guild of Guyana - and James Alwyn ( `` Sonny '' ) Rodway , a Queen 's College educator , Education Officer for the island of St. Lucia and later mentor to Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott . Walcott would go on to establish the 'James Rodway Memorial Prize ' for St. Lucian poets in their honour . 'Sonny ' Rodway 's second wife was Guyanese composer Valerie Rodway .
Great-grandsons include Adrian Rodway – a journalist central to events of the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation strike of 1964 , supported by Michael Manley – and political activist Brian Rodway , one of the founding members of the Working People 's Alliance party and close confidant of Walter Rodney .
Amongst Rodway 's great-granddaughters is Professor Cicely Rodway , author of 'Sunstreams and Shadows '' ' ( 2001 ) .

Curzon Mill , later known as Alger Mill was a cotton spinning mill in the Hurst district of Ashton-under-Lyne , Greater Manchester , in England . It was built between 1899 and 1902 for the Ashton Syndicate by Sydney Stott of Oldham . It was a sister mill to the Atlas Mill . It was sold to the Alger Spinning Co. Ltd in 1911 , and closed in 1942 . It was then used as a cigarette factory by the J.A . Pattreiouex company until 1966 , and then sold to the Qualitex company for the production of artificial fibres . It was still spinning artificial fibres in the 1990s and was demolished in 1994 ; the site being used for a housing estate .
Location
Curzon Mill was built on Cedar Street , Hurst .
History
The Minerva Spinning Company Limited was registered in 1891 to build the Minerva Mill at Whitelands . The directors were Messrs Barlow , Marland , Coop , Newton , Pollitt and Pownall ; they were later referred to as the Ashton syndicate . In 1891 , they built the Rock Mill , and in 1898 built Atlas Mill . Curzon Mill built between 1899 and 1902 was their fourth mill and a sister mill to the Atlas mill . It was registered as the Curzon Mill Co. Ltd , with a capital of GBP70,000 . Tudor Mill , Cedar Mill and finally the Texas Mill followed .
The cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth . The great war of 1914–1918 halted the supply of raw cotton , and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton . The war over , Lancashire never regained its markets . The Ashton syndicate sold the mill to the Alger Spinning Company Limited in 1911 , and the mill was renamed the Alger Mill . The Alger Spinning Co was liquidated in 1941 .
Architecture
This was a Sydney Stott building . It was four storeys high built on a basement from engineering brick . The large windows were in groups of three , and there was white tile decoration . It had a Hotel-de-Ville style water tower . The six bay engine house , boiler house and chimney were to the north-west
Power
The steam engine was by George Saxon & Co , of Openshaw . It was 1200 hp horizontal triple expansion four-cylinder engines , that ran the forty ton flywheel at 60rpm .
There were two 37in diameter low pressure cylinders ( LP ) , an intermediate ( IP ) of 32in and a high pressure ( HP ) of 20in . They had a 60in stroke . They had Corliss valves and the airpumps were driven from each crosshead . The boiler operated at 160 psi . The flywheel was 26 ft in diameter and was grooved for 28 ropes .
Equipment
All the mule frames and equipment was by Hetherington and Sons Ltd . There were 77,184 mule spindles spinning fine counts of twists and weft from Egyptian cotton . By 1911 it was spinning medium counts of American .
Usage
Curzon Mill was used for spinning fine counts of twists and weft from Egyptian cotton . In 1911 it was spinning medium counts of American cotton .
Owners
Curzon Mill Company , part of the Ashton syndicate .
Alger Spinning Company Ltd. ( 1911–1942 )
J.A . Pattreiouex , cigarette manufacturers ( 1942–1966 )
Qualitex Yarns ( 1968– )
Notable events/media
In 1904 there was a lengthy and acrimonious strike at Curzon Mill . The causes and settlement are unclear , but because of the friction and a depression in the market , the directors failed to pay a dividend to the shareholders for half-year ending 24 September 1904 . Two possible causes could have been the directors employing 'non-union labour ' , or tension between management and the spinners and the cardroom operatives . At any rate , the trouble moved onto the street and many women were arrested and bound over to keep the peace for 'shouting ' . Commenting on the settlement , the mayor , Alderman Shaw , whose efforts paved the way for a settlement said `` Both sides have given way a little , but neither cares to admit it . ''

Pontogeneus ( nomen dubium ) is a genus of extinct cetacean known from fossils recovered from Late Eocene sediments ( Bartonian-Priabonian stages ) of the southeastern United States ( most notably Alabama and Florida ) .
Classification
When `` Zeuglodon '' brachyspondylus was formerly included , Pontogeneus was depicted as having a skeleton similar to that of Basilosaurus cetoides , although the posterior thoracic vertebrae , the lumbar vertebrae , and the anterior caudal vertebrae had proportions closer to those seen in members of the archaeocete Subfamily Dorudontinae .
Taxonomic history
In 1852 , Joseph Leidy had erected Pontogeneus priscus based on the centrum of a single cervical vertebra in the collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia . Leidy noted that the centrum had been collected from exposures along the Washita River in Louisiana . synonymized these two taxa to form Pontogeneus brachyspondylus which they listed as incertae sedis .
designated Pontogeneus priscus and Zeuglodon brachyspondylus to be nomina dubia based on the lack of diagnostic characters that distinguish the type specimens from other basilosaurids . While Pontogeneus priscus is no longer considered valid , `` Z . '' brachyspondylus appears similar to Masracetus from Egypt ( which was also referred to Z. brachyspondylus in the past ) and may represent either a species of Masracetus or a distinct and closely related but as-yet-unnamed genus .
Formerly assigned to Pontogeneus
`` Zeuglodon brachyspondylus '' ( ) was erected for several vertebrae collected in either Choctaw or Washington counties in southern Alabama .
Basilosaurid remains from Egypt were tentatively assigned to Zeuglodon brachyspondylus based on superficial similarities to the syntype series ( under the old hypothesis of synonymy of Pontogeneus and Zeuglodon brachyspondylus ) . However , these remains were given their own genus , Masracetus , given minor differences from `` Z . '' brachyspondylus .

The Ben-Gurion House is a historic house museum in Tel Aviv , which served as the family home of pre-State Zionist leader and then first Defense and Prime Minister of Israel , David Ben-Gurion , between 1931 and 1953 . Until their death in 1973 it continued serving as an additional residence , along with two others , one private – `` Ben-Gurion 's hut '' at Kibbutz Sde Boker in the Negev ( known as their desert home ) , and the official residence as Prime Minister of Israel during their multiple terms as head of government . The latter , known as Julius Jacobs House , is located in Rehavia , Jerusalem .
Ben-Gurion House is located at 17 , Ben-Gurion Boulevard in northern Tel Aviv .
History and structure
The house was built in 1930–1931 , and David Ben-Gurion and their family lived there from June 1931 until 1953 , when they moved to a small wooden house in Kibbutz Sde-Boker in the Negev desert , after which they returned to the Tel Aviv house only part of each year .
The house was built on Jewish National Fund ( JNF ) land , when the first shechunat ha-po'alim ( lit . workers neighborhood , i.e . a workers housing project ) was established there in 1930–31 , as Shechunat HaPo'alim Aleph , at the junction of Jewish National Fund Boulevard and Lassalle Street . The Jewish National Fund ( Hebrew : Keren Kayemet Le'Israel ) Boulevard was renamed to Ben-Gurion Boulevard after the politician 's death in 1973 .
The house was designed by engineer David Tuvia , and as customary in `` workers neighborhoods '' in Israel at the time , the house included only one room and was worth 350 British Mandate pounds . The Ben-Gurion family asked for permission to build a second floor , which was granted . The house was expanded in 1946 , and renovated in 1960 .
First floor
The first floor included the room of Ben-Gurion 's second daughter , Renana . It also served Ben-Gurion during the Suez Crisis ( Mivtza ' Kadesh , `` Operation Kadesh '' ) as a shelter and a bedroom . From this room Ben-Gurion conducted their communication with Moshe Dayan , then their Chief of Staff , and from there they received front line updates on the progress of the operation .
Second floor
The second floor houses a four-room library , a toilet and a bedroom , and served only Ben-Gurion themselves at the time .
The library holds their personal collection of periodicals and 20,000 books , in ancient Greek , Latin , English , Hebrew , French , Turkish , German , Russian and other languages . The library , known for its unusual size , may give an idea as to Ben-Gurion 's fields of interest . The books deal mainly with the subjects of Zionism , history , various cultures and religions , a collection of Hebrew Bible books and more . The many books on IDF 's fallen soldiers show the importance given to this subject by Ben-Gurion .
One of the library rooms served as Ben-Gurion 's study room , where they had their own study corner , in which they wrote in their diary . It also contained a special phone , that was a direct line to the Defense Ministry 's office ( compare the Red Phone ) .
On 13 May 1948 , Ben-Gurion hosted the Minhelet ha'am ( People 's Administration ) body : Aharon Zisling , Yehuda Leib Maimon , and Moshe Sharett , where they formulated and drafted the final version of the Israeli Declaration of Independence ( Megilat HaAtzma'ut ) . The next day , they went from this house to Dizengoff House , now known as Independence Hall , and where the Tel Aviv Museum of Art was located at the time , where Ben-Gurion announced on the establishment of the State of Israel .
The house nowadays
In their will Ben-Gurion requested to bequest the house to the State of Israel , as is stated :
Three years after Ben-Gurion died , the Ben-Gurion law 1977 was enacted , which stipulates that the house will be open to the public , and will serve as a museum in memory of Ben-Gurion and as a commemoration of their legacy , as well `` as a Reading , Reviewing and Research center '' , as Ben-Gurion themselves requested .
The house was opened to the public on 29 November 1974 , and as of today , guided tours and symposiums are conducted in the house , with the purpose of depicting Ben-Gurion 's character and life work as a leader . In addition , memorabilia , historical documents , and Ben-Gurion 's titles awarded to them when they were prime minister are exhibited in the house .
The Boulevard in which the house is situated , was called at the time Ben-Gurion lived there , Keren Kayemet Boulevard ( `` Jewish National Fund Boulevard '' ) , and was renamed Ben-Gurion Boulevard after Ben-Gurion died . The name Keren Kayemet Boulevard was then moved to a central street within a northern Tel Aviv neighborhood , Ever Ha-Yarkon suburb , and is still named after the JNF today .

Jake Angeli ( born Jacob Anthony Angeli Chansley ; 1988 ) , also known as the QAnon Shaman , Q Shaman , and Yellowstone Wolf , is an American activist and conspiracy theorist who participated in the 2021 United States Capitol attack , and was later convicted for their actions on that day . They have been a supporter of President Donald Trump and a believer and disseminator of the QAnon conspiracy theory .
Angeli attended demonstrations in the Phoenix area from around 2019 . At rallies , they promoted conspiracy theories supporting Trump , and they have been a counterprotestor at Black Lives Matter ( BLM ) events .
After being photographed taking part in the storming of the Capitol , Angeli was arrested on January 9 on federal charges of `` knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority , and with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds '' . They pleaded guilty to a single charge in September 2021 , and was sentenced to three and a half years , or 41 months , in prison in November 2021 .
Early life and education
Jake Angeli was born in 1988 , to Martha Chansley . They attended Moon Valley High School in Phoenix , Arizona , and Glendale Community College , where they completed some coursework in psychology , religion , philosophy , and ceramics .
Career
Angeli enlisted in the United States Navy on September 26 , 2005 . After boot camp and training as a supply clerk , they were assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk in March 2006 . At some point , they refused to take an anthrax vaccine and was scheduled for dismissal from the Navy . On September 29 , 2007 , they were sent to a Transient Personnel Unit in Puget Sound in Washington state , and was processed out of the Navy on October 11 . After two years and 15 days in uniform , their final rank was Storekeeper Seaman Apprentice . Their military awards and decorations include the National Defense Service Medal , the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal , the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon and the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon .
Angeli self-published two books : Will & Power : Inside the Living Library ( Volume 1 ) , published in 2017 under the pen name Loan Wolf ; and One Mind at a Time : A Deep State of Illusion , published in 2020 under the name Jacob Angeli . They produced and narrated 11 videos espousing various conspiracy theories and uploaded them to the platform Rumble in late 2020 .
Angeli had a profile on the Backstage website seeking work as an actor .
Activism
Angeli was formerly a supporter of Donald Trump , has a social media following and has attended rallies supporting QAnon , mostly in and around Phoenix . At various rallies in Arizona , they shouted about QAnon conspiracy theories and carried a sign that says `` Q Sent Me '' .
In 2019 Angeli frequently protested alone outside the Arizona Capitol , espousing various conspiracy theories . They were reported as a shamanic practitioner when attending a climate activism protest in Arizona and their ideology has been described as ecofascist . In early 2020 they told The Arizona Republic that they began wearing a fur hat and face paint to attract attention so that they could then talk about QAnon and `` other truths '' . They appeared at a Black Lives Matter ( BLM ) protest in the Phoenix area in order to spread the QAnon conspiracy theory . They protested COVID-19 lockdowns in Arizona .
Following the 2020 United States presidential election , Angeli 's protests focused on challenging the results of the vote in Arizona . They camped outside the Maricopa County Courthouse during the vote counting process , and gave a speech at a rally there on November 7 , the day that president-elect Joe Biden announced their win , declaring , `` This election has not been called ! Do n't believe that lie ! They got their hands caught in the cookie jar and we 're going to the Supreme Court ! Trump always looks like he 's going to lose . And then they win . ''
Participation in the 2021 Capitol attack
During the 2021 United States Capitol attack on January 6 , Angeli entered the United States Senate floors in the Capitol , wearing their `` shamanic '' attire , including a bison-horned fur headdress , and war paint in red , white , and blue , as well as carrying a spear , with an American flag tied below the spear head . They were also photographed standing on the raised platform in front of Vice President Mike Pence 's chair , gaining them significant media attention . They later said police had initially blocked the crowd from entry , but had then specifically allowed them entry , at which point they entered . However , on March 16 , 2021 , the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. released previously unseen video footage of Angeli entering the Capitol building after windows were smashed .
Court transcripts reveal Angeli told the FBI that they had traveled to the Capitol `` as a part of a group effort , with other 'patriots ' from Arizona , at the request of the President that all 'patriots ' come to DC on January 6 , 2021 '' . Prior to the Capitol being invaded , Angeli called out for the demonstrators to pause and join them in prayer , saying , `` Thank you for allowing the United States to be reborn . We love you and we thank you . In Christ 's holy name , we pray . '' After the riot , Angeli told reporters , `` The fact that we had a bunch of our traitors in office hunker down , put on their gas masks and retreat into their underground bunker , I consider that a win . ''
On January 8 , Angeli was posted as a person of interest with the Washington DC Police . Interviewed while wanted , Angeli said that they believed they did nothing wrong , telling NBC : `` I walked through an open door , dude . '' On January 8 , Angeli told KPNX that they `` was n't worried '' about possible charges . Angeli had no criminal record in Arizona before taking part in the riot .
Arrest and criminal proceedings
On January 9 , Angeli was arrested and brought up on U.S. federal charges of `` knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority , and with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds '' . A Capitol police special agent was quoted as saying that they identified Angeli by their `` unique attire and extensive tattoos covering their arms and left side of their torso '' . Angeli voluntarily spoke to the Washington Field Office of the FBI prior to their arrest . In a January 14 court filing , federal prosecutors said that Angeli had left a note on Pence 's desk in the Senate chamber that said `` It 's only a matter of time , justice is coming . ''
While jailed awaiting trial , Angeli refused to eat because the food served was not organic . Subsequently , a court ordered that they receive organic food .
Beginning in January 2021 through their guilty plea on September 2 , Angeli was represented by St. Louis attorney Albert Watkins . In a written statement , Watkins argued that Angeli had no part in the violence , did not hide their identity , was unarmed , not destructive , and followed the instructions of law enforcement officials in a respectful fashion ; and that Angeli was carrying a megaphone so their voice could be heard . Additionally , they presented evidence Angeli had been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder while serving the Navy . They also said in an interview with KSDK in St. Louis , `` [ Angeli ] is responsible for their actions . They regret where they are today '' . Watkins publicly called on President Trump to pardon their client , arguing that Angeli had been unarmed , not violent , and not destructive , and had been acting on the `` invitation '' of the president . Later in January , Angeli made overtures for a presidential pardon from Trump through White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows . When the pardon was not granted , Watkins said , `` He ( Angeli ) regrets very very much having not just been duped by the President , but by being in a position where they allowed that duping to put them in a position to make decisions they should not have made . '' According to Watkins , Angeli was prepared to testify against Trump in their second impeachment trial . However , the trial ended with Trump 's acquittal without any witnesses being called .
On March 8 , 2021 , federal judge Royce Lamberth ruled that Angeli should not be released from jail , saying their lawyer 's arguments were `` so frivolous as to insult the Court 's intelligence '' . In a written statement , the judge said the `` defendant does not fully appreciate the severity of the allegations against him . ''
On September 3 , 2021 , Angeli pleaded guilty to a single count of obstructing an official proceeding and agreed to accept the prosecution 's recommended sentence of 41 to 51 months in prison as part of the settlement . Earlier , their lawyer said Angeli broke away from QAnon and asked that it no longer be used in terms for him . Judge Lamberth turned down a request for release ( Angeli wanted to visit their grandfather while Watkins wanted to provide them with shelter and care for their mental health ) on the grounds that there was no convincing evidence that there would not be any risk of escape . On November 17 , Angeli was sentenced to 41 months in prison . As of May 1 , 2022 , they were incarcerated at Federal Correctional Institution , Safford under BOP register # 24866-509 .
Disinformation concerning role
After the storming of the Capitol , pro-Trump users on Facebook circulated rumors trying to disassociate Angeli as a Trump supporter and right wing advocate , spreading false information that Angeli was instead associated with antifa or the Black Lives Matter ( BLM ) movement and had infiltrated the event as an agent provocateur . Those false reports frequently included a photo of Angeli at a BLM rally in Arizona , cropping out their `` Q Sent Me '' sign that indicates that Angeli was counter-protesting rather than participating in the rally .
In a January 6 tweet from their Twitter account , USAwolfpack , Angeli responded to speculations made by Trump campaign lawyer Lin Wood : `` Mr. Wood . I am not antifa or blm . I 'm a Qanon & digital soldier . My name is Jake & I marched with the police & fought against BLM & ANTIFA in PHX . '' Snopes investigated the statement , concluding that they did attend a BLM rally , that they are not affiliated with Antifa , and was an active Trump supporter .
There was also disinformation propagated which falsely claimed Angeli colluded with Nancy Pelosi 's son-in-law , Michiel Vos , seen in a photo with them outside the U.S. Capitol Building . Snopes wrote that Vos is a reporter with the Dutch free-to-air television channel RTL , and the image is from a story on the protests which Vos wrote for Dutch news program RTL Boulevard .
Views
Angeli has stated their beliefs that televisions and radios emit `` very specific frequencies that are inaudible , '' that `` affect the brain waves of your brain '' . They have also spoken about the Bilderberg conspiracy theory and said that Freemasons designed Washington , D.C. according to `` ley lines '' that amplify the Earth 's magnetic field . During a 2020 interview on ORF , Angeli declared that `` in order to beat this evil occultic force you need a light occultic force … [ you need ] a force that is of the side of God , of love … almost like on the side of the angels … as opposed to the demons . '' In reflecting on the Capitol storming , Angeli said that `` What we did on January 6 in many ways was an evolution in consciousness , because as we marched down the street along these ley lines shouting 'USA ' or shouting things like 'freedom ' ... we were actually affecting the quantum realm . ''
Prosecutors have alleged that Angeli believes they are an alien or higher being and is destined to ascend to another reality .
When asked about their son 's views in 2021 , Martha Chansley told ABC15 Arizona that `` it takes a lot of courage to be a patriot '' .
In popular culture
An animated Angeli appears in the 2021 `` South ParQ Vaccination Special '' episode of South Park , in which they become a home school tutor for `` Tutornon '' .
Likewise , a character dressed in attire similar to Angeli 's appears in a 2021 episode of It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia titled `` 2020 : A Year In Review '' , as well as in a 2021 episode of Reno 911 ! .
In January 2022 , Will Forte 's character MacGruber appeared dressed as Angeli on an episode of Saturday Night Live .

At the end of 2001 Brivio was promoted to team manager of the Yamaha MotoGP efforts . The sport was moving to four-stroke engines for 2002 , and they were expected to bring relevant expertise from World Superbike which has used four-stroke engines since the series ' inception . Brivio was instrumental in coaxing Valentino Rossi to move away from Honda and join Yamaha in 2004 . From 2004 to 2010 , Brivio and Yamaha enjoyed success with 5 riders ' championships ( Rossi in 2004 , 2005 , 2008 and 2009 , and Jorge Lorenzo in 2010 ) and 4 constructors ' championships ( 2005 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 ) .

With this success , the team however lost their development concessions , leading to a difficult 2017 with only sporadic points finishes and subsequently regaining their concessions . A return in form in 2018 saw the team achieve 9 podiums that year , and in 2019 Álex Rins took two wins in America and Great Britain .
In 2020 , Brivio 's efforts came to fruition , with the team taking 2 wins and 11 podiums en route to the teams ' championship and a riders ' championship for Joan Mir , the first for Suzuki since 2000 with Kenny Roberts Jr .

Ultima II : The Revenge of the Enchantress , released on August 24 , 1982 , for the Apple II ( USCO # PA-317-502 ) , is the second role-playing video game in the Ultima series , and the second installment in Ultima 's `` Age of Darkness '' trilogy .
It was also the only official Ultima game published by Sierra On-Line . Conflict with Sierra over royalties for the IBM port of this game led the series creator Richard Garriott to start their own company , Origin Systems .
The plot of Ultima II revolves around the evil enchantress Minax , taking over the world and exacting revenge on the player for the player 's defeat of Mondain in Ultima . The player travels through time to acquire the means to defeat Minax and restore the world to peace . Ultima II has a larger game world than Ultima I , and hosts advances in graphics and in gameplay .
Gameplay
The gameplay is very similar to the previous game in the series , Ultima I : The First Age of Darkness . The scope of the game is bigger , in that there are several more places to explore , even though some of them ( like most of the Solar System planets and the dungeons and towers ) are not required to complete the game .
In the game , the player has to travel to several different time periods of Earth , using time doors . The periods are the Time of Legends ( a mythological period ) , Pangea ( about 300 to 250 million years ago ) , B.C . ( 1423 , `` before the dawn of civilization '' ) , A.D. ( 1990 ) , and the Aftermath ( after 2112 ) . The player also has to travel to space , where all the planets in the Solar System can be visited .
Plot
From the game 's story , the player learns that the lover of the dark wizard Mondain , the enchantress Minax , is threatening Earth through disturbances in the space-time continuum . The player must guide a hero through time and the Solar System to defeat their evil plot .
The young Minax survived their mentor 's and lover 's death at the hands of the Stranger ( in Ultima I : The First Age of Darkness ) and went into hiding . Several years later , Minax got older and very powerful , more so than Mondain once was . Minax wanted to avenge the death of their lover , so they used the time doors created by Mondain 's defeat to travel to the Time of Legends , a place located at the origin of times . From there , they sent their evil minions to all the different time eras ; they also used their dark powers to disturb the fabric of time and influence men , who ultimately destroyed each other in the far future , nearly wiping out humanity .
Lord British called for a hero to crush Minax 's evil plans . The Stranger once again answered British 's call . The game begins with the Stranger starting their quest to defeat Minax . Minax 's castle , named Shadow Guard , can only be reached through time doors ( similar to moongates in the later games ) ; even then an enchanted ring is required to pass unhurt through the force fields inside . The hero hunts down the sorceress to the Time of Legends , pursues them as they teleport throughout the castle , and destroys them with the quicksword Enilno .
Even though Ultima I is set on the fictional land of Sosaria , Ultima II borrowed characters and the story of Ultima I , but relocated them to Earth . Garriott explained from a narrative perspective , Earth needed to be used as a basis for comparison due to the time travel element . Later games in the Ultima series ret-conned this , and assumed that Ultima II actually happened on Sosaria , not Earth , to create a continuity among the games .
Development and versions
Ultima II was Garriott 's first program that they wrote completely in assembly language instead of interpreted BASIC . Playing speed and reaction time were vastly improved over the original release of Ultima I . Since Garriott was attending the University of Texas at the time it took them almost two years to create Ultima II , including learning assembly in one month from Tom Luhrs , the author of the popular Apple II arcade game Apple-Oids .
Ultima II was the first game in the series to include a cloth map inside the box , which would become a staple of the franchise . This map , which illustrated how the time doors were linked , was inspired by the one seen in the film Time Bandits , as were the time doors themselves . California Pacific Computer , which published Garriott 's first two games , had financial difficulties and did not pay full royalties ; when other publishers approached them Garriott insisted on including the map . Sierra On-Line agreed and provided Garriott , who had left the university , with technical assistance as they developed their first major assembly language project . Two versions of this map were produced . The first version is of a heavier and thicker material . This map can be found in the large boxed ( 8 '' x11 '' ) Apple II and Atari 800 versions of the game . Later production runs of the game featured a much smaller box and a lighter weight map .
Despite reservations of Richard Garriott and Chuck Bueche , the original Apple II version of the game was copy-protected using Sierra 's new Spiradisc system .
The original Apple Ultima II received an audiovisual upgrade in 1989 , bringing its graphics up to date with more recent games in the series much as was done with Ultima I . This `` enhanced '' version was only available as part of the Ultima Trilogy I-II-III box set released that year and discontinued only months later . ( The Commodore and IBM versions of the Ultima Trilogy include the original , unenhanced versions of the game for their respective platforms . )
The game was re-released several times later in CD-ROM PC compilations , including 1998 's Ultima Collection . All these re-releases are missing necessary map files for most planets other than Earth ; however , the map for `` Planet X '' is intact and the game is still winnable . Modern ( too fast ) computers also generate a divide by zero error when attempting to run the game . These issues are addressed with fan patches created by Voyager Dragon , a fan of the series , and are available on their website The Exodus Project . The game is known to run without errors and at an acceptable speed in a DOSBox environment , provided the missing map files are present .
Ultima II was the first game in the series officially ported to platforms other than the Apple II .
Atari 8-bit
The Atari version was released in late 1983 , several months after the Apple original . It requires an Atari 800 and an 810 disk drive . The game is mostly a direct port from the Apple II using the computer 's high resolution graphics ( which works in a similar manner to the Apple II 's HGR mode ) but does not otherwise take advantage of the Atari 's advanced features .
Commodore 64
The C64 port was apparently released before the programmer ( credited only as `` Bobbit '' ) could finish . As a consequence , it is missing some gameplay elements and also has a simplified title screen with text characters instead of the dragon graphic on other versions . Otherwise , the Commodore 64 version takes advantage of the platform 's advanced graphics and sound .
PC compatibles
The IBM version of Ultima II is a DOS game and does not run off a self-booting disk , which was unusual for a game released in 1983 . It supports only CGA graphics and PC speaker sound and also uses the CPU for timing , hence it will run too fast on anything except an 8088 PC . Ultima II is designed for DOS 1.x and does not support subdirectories , so save games must be in the same directory as the game files . The PC port is also prone to generating divide by zero errors and crashing to the DOS prompt . The original contract between Garriott and Sierra On-Line did n't include an IBM PC edition , because Garriott considered this system `` cumbersome , expensive and underpowered '' ; they later are disappointed by the contract terms for this port and started thinking about starting their own company .
Macintosh
In May 1985 , Sierra released a port of Ultima II for the Macintosh 128K/512K . Along with Ultima III , this would be the only of the classic Ultima games available for the Macintosh family . The game is compatible with macOS versions up to System 6 and will run on System 7.5 with a patch .
Atari ST
The Atari ST port was one of the earliest commercially released games for the system , coming out shortly after the computer 's June 1985 launch . It uses mostly simple block graphics with little enhancement for the ST 's hardware capabilities and runs from within TOS , not a self-booting disk as most Atari ST games do .
Reception
Softline in 1983 stated that Ultima II `` continues the interplanetary saga with a creative programming flair far beyond the scope of most fantasy or adventure games '' . The magazine concluded that `` Lord British has another , greater hit on their hands ... the ultimate in real-time D & D type fantasy games for the micro '' . Computer Gaming World in 1983 gave Ultima II a positive review , noting many improvements over its predecessor , particularly in the amount of detail . The magazine praised the large size of the game world , even though little of it is necessary to complete the game , suggesting that additional scenarios would be added leading up to an `` Ultimate '' quest . In 1991 and 1993 the magazine 's Scorpia called it `` a good sequel to the original game '' . K-Power gave the game 7 points out of 10 . The magazine described it as `` an animated graphic adventure game '' and stated that Ultima II `` is more sophisticated and has a quicker pace '' than its predecessor , with a `` fascinating '' world . It concluded that the game was `` unique and its storyline is original '' . PC Magazine gave Ultima II 15.5 points out of 18 , also praising the game 's `` great big wonderful world '' .
Computer Games magazine reviewed the IBM PC conversion , calling it `` engrossing and enjoyable . '' Patricia Fitzgibbons reviewed the Macintosh version of the game for Computer Gaming World , and stated that `` Although Ultima II is an exciting – even indispensable – addition to any Mac owner 's game library , this version unfortunately contains a number of atrocious misspellings ( `` paralized , '' `` caugh '' ) and bugs '' .
Ultima II sold over 50,000 copies by November 1985 , and nearly 100,000 copies by 1990 . It was nominated for `` Best Adventure Game for Home Computer '' at the 1983 Origins Game Fair , losing to Wizardry II : The Knight of Diamonds .

Hohenleimbach is a municipality in the district of Ahrweiler , in Rhineland-Palatinate , Germany .
History
The village was first mentioned in 1425 as a fief of a Peter von Thys named Leimbach . This original placename was in use until the beginning of the 20th century . Since the 18th century the nickname Wüstleimbach showed up . The prefix `` Wüst '' means `` deserted '' in the sense of lost or abandoned . Due to the barren fields and the severe poverty of the inhabitants they decided to emigrate mainly to America leaving their farms behind which were abandoned afterwards . The population of the largely abandoned village decreased below 100 in the 17th and 18th centuries . According to a resolution of the local borough council in 1914 , the village was allowed , by an imperial decree of 31 January 1916 , to rename itself Hohenleimbach , because of the negative image of the nickname Wüstleimbach ( `` deserted Leimbach '' ) . The small village Lederbach one mile in the north is part of the municipality . Centuries ago there was another little village named Rembach and situated in the south of Hohenleimbach at the mouth of the Lederbach ( `` Leatherbrook '' ) running into the Nette rivulet , consisting of only four farms . First mentioned in 1337 it had to be already abandoned in the 17th century due to poverty .

The Chicago Reporter is a monthly periodical based in Chicago , Illinois , USA . Founded in 1972 , it covers poverty and race issues . It was founded by John A. McDermott , who sought to create `` the nation 's first publication devoted to analyzing and investigating local racial issues . '' In 1974 , its yearly budget was $ 120,000 , most of which was paid by the Ford Foundation . In 2016 , sister publication Catalyst , focused on education , merged into The Chicago Reporter .
The Interm Editor and Publisher is Glenn Reedus .
Impact
The Chicago Reporter 's investigative reporting has had impact in several areas of Chicago and Illinois infrastructure . The paper 's earliest influence was its expose of the Chicago Police Department 's discriminatory disorderly conduct arrests in 1982 , which prompted the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) to file suit against them , leading to a U.S District Court Judge to rule their arrests unconstitutional . By 1983 , the Chicago Police Department 's disorderly arrest policy had to be changed to meet federal law . In 2007 , The Chicago Reporter also released a study detailing how the largest mortgage lender in the country , Countrywide , was lending high interest loans in majority to minority lenders leading then attorney general of Illinois Lisa Madigan to subpoena Countrywide , ultimately resulting in an $ 8.7 billion settlement in 2008 . The Chicago Reporter also won recognition for reporting on the Chicago Fire Department 's under-reporting fire deaths in poor and minority neighborhoods .
Reputation
The Chicago Reporter 's style is regarded as `` dispassionate investigative journalism '' that has garnered it critical acclaim by several other news publications as well as politicians . U.S Senator for Illinois , Dick Durbin , has said , `` The Chicago Reporter gives us reflection , not reflex . In a digital world of speed and brevity , their coverage takes the time and invests the analysis in issues ranging from gun control to deficits to immigration . The Chicago Reporter earns its stripes with credibility and relevance '' . Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune stated `` The Chicago Reporter is 'consistently focused on covering what continues to be Chicago 's toughest , yet most important story : race relations . ' ''
Awards
The Chicago Reporter and its staff have won several awards beginning in 1974 , including the Sigma Delta Chi Award for Public Service from the Society of Professional Journalists , dozens of Peter Lisagor Awards , and the Salute to Excellence Award from the National Association of Black Journalists .

Alix Pasquet ( November 14 , 1919 – July 29 , 1958 ) was a World War II fighter pilot , one of only five Haitian members of the Tuskegee Airmen , a soccer star , and a political revolutionary . They were killed while leading a coup attempt against Haitian President François Duvalier in 1958 .
Fighter pilot
In 1942 , Haitian President Élie Lescot implemented an aviation corps program and chose 3 men out of 42 corps members to receive pilot training in Tuskegee , Alabama . Alix Pasquet , a law graduate of École Millitaire d'Haiti and an officer in the Haitian army at the time , was one of these three chosen officers .
The U.S. government needed the Haitians to organize a patrol of the Caribbean Sea during World War II and gave the Haitian government six airplanes . These airplanes could carry bombs and could be used to attack German submarines within that area . In February 1943 , Pasquet , along with Raymond Cassagnol and Philippe Célestin , traveled from Port-au-Prince to Alabama to begin training at the famed Tuskegee Flight School . The Tuskegee Airmen were renowned for their unmatched record of more than 200 combat missions with few losses . Pasquet 's training went through three stages—primary , basic , and advanced—and was extremely rigorous . They were trained by Jimmy Plinton , Jr. , who was reputed as one of the best trainers in the Tuskegee Air Force program , over the course of a 7-month program .
The Afro-American Newspaper , one of the most widely circulated black newspapers at that time , ran a feature story on Pasquet , Cassagnol , and Célestin in April 1943 , and the trio was noted for their aptitude with the English language . Additionally since Pasquet and their compatriots were from Haiti , they were unfamiliar with the pervasive racial segregation and racism in the American South at that time and were forced to ride on Blacks-Only transportation or sit in the back of trains . As a result , they rarely ventured off-campus . Pasquet had a bad case of the flu and lost a month of their training , but ultimately graduated in August 1943 as a member of class 43G .
Political revolutionary
After the end of World War II , Pasquet returned to Haiti . However , they were exiled in 1957 for supporting Louis Déjoie in the May 1957 Haitian Civil War . From exile in Miami , Pasquet led a political movement to restore stability in their native country and overthrow current ruler François Duvalier . In 1958 , they returned to Haiti with Henri Perpignan and Phillipe Dominique as well as five Americans—Arthur Payne , Dany Jones , Levant Kersten , Robert F. Hickey and Joe D. Walker—with the intention of overpowering the capital 's army barracks and capturing the ammunition depot within . They gained entry through the barracks ' gate by convincing the sentry that they were an officer delivering prisoners , and then quickly seized control of the barracks . However the plot was foiled when an accomplice , Henri Perpignan , sent a prisoner to acquire Haitian-blend cigarettes , who then revealed crucial details to the incumbent government about Pasquet 's position .
Pasquet was killed during the attempted coup and buried in Port-au-Prince .
Personal life
Pasquet married Denise Etheart and had three sons : Gilbert Pasquet , Alix Pasquet Jr. , and Bernard Pasquet . In 1973 their son , Alix , married Michèle Bennett , who later married François Duvalier 's son , Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc ' Duvalier .

The baptistery at Butrint ( ) , is an archeological site in Vlorë County , Albania and part of the Butrint National Park , is a late antique structure known for its well-preserved mosaic pavement . The centrally planned , circular baptistery is also notable as an ancient Roman monument adapted to the needs of Christianity .
Constructed in the 6th century A.D. , the baptistry was excavated in May 1928 by an Italian archaeological mission to Albania , led by Luigi Maria Ugolini .
The baptismal font and water supply
The round structure of the baptistery , measuring 14.5 meters in diameter , was built within a large rectangular space that was either part of a Roman bathhouse or household bathing complex . Archeologists have identified a small room to the northeast of the baptistery as a caldarium , or hot-room , of a Roman hypocaust heating system . The prior existence of this system may explain the choice to build a baptistery there .
The cross-shaped font , the baptistry 's central feature , has two interior steps , allowing those about to be baptized to step down into the basin . There , the bishop would have poured water over them with a small vessel . The eastern corner room held a water tank and praefurnium , or furnace for heating water . The hot water was piped underground directly to the font , where it was mixed with cold water from a cistern built into the older Roman caldarium .
Situated within an arched structure in the baptistery wall is another small fountain . It is positioned directly facing the entrance , an unusual characteristic for a baptistry . Archeologists believe it served a symbolic purpose as an image of the Fountain of Life , a Christian iconographic symbol associated with baptism .
Columns
Two concentric colonnades ( each with eight columns , for a total of 16 ) once supported a wooden roof . Made from Egyptian granite , the columns stood on a variety of repurposed bases . However , the Ionic impost capitals , which feature acanthus leaves and crosses , were likely made specifically for the building . The wall 's interior also featured 24 half-columns and was covered with plaster and painted . A low bench , possibly once covered with polished marble , ran continuously around the foot of the interior wall .
Archeologist John Mitchell , in their book The Butrint Baptistry and its Mosaics , remarks on the uniqueness of these two colonnades from an architectural standpoint , writing , `` ... the fact that each consists of eight columns means that the distance between the shafts in the outer ring is about twice that in the inner ring . This gives rise to technical and aesthetic issues -- far wider and higher arches on the outer arcade -- that must have tested the ingenuity of architect to the limit . The scheme must have been driven by symbolic considerations -- the power of the number eight . ... No other building of the period takes this form . ''
Mosaics
Today , the most remarkable aspect of the Butrint baptistery is its mosaic pavement . Most likely created by mosaicists from Nicopolis , the mosaic floor is considered the most complex of any late antique baptismal structure still existing in the Mediterranean today . of seven circling bands turning around the central font , the mosaic features iconography relating both to Christianity and to aristocratic life .
The Butrint baptistery mosaics feature two prominent scenes , each strongly evoking Christian iconography befitting a baptismal theme . In one , peacocks are depicted on either side of a kantharos , out of which dangle vines bearing clusters of grapes . According to Mitchell , as peacock flesh was believed not to decompose , the appearance of the animal in late antique art would have symbolized eternal life . The other main scene depicts two stags at a fountain , a reference to a verse from Psalm 42 ( “ As the hart panteth for the water brooks , so panteth my soul after thee , O God. ” ) . Together , the two images connect water with the concept of everlasting life .
The rest of the mosaics , which feature animals represented within intersecting roundels across the floor , do not carry an overt Christian meaning , though Mitchell interprets them as representative of the biblical Garden of Eden . Birds and sea animals , as well as domesticated and exotic creatures , are juxtaposed . Several panels , however , also reference the hunt , well known throughout classical antiquity as a favored sport of the aristocracy . Thus , the inclusion of exotic creatures , such as leopards , alongside symbols such as a hunting dog and a net could also reference the staged animal hunts conducted by the elite .
Varying motifs throughout the rounded floor may also have demarcated areas of ceremonial importance within the baptistery , rather than simply serve as decoration . Mitchell noted that the checked pattern surrounding the central fountain matches the checked pattern on some of the outermost rings of the medallions . This might have indicated the place where the bishop stood and visually connected the ceremonial power of the fountain with that of the bishop .

The Protective Trust is a form of settlement found in England and Wales and several Commonwealth countries . It has marked similarities to asset-protection trusts found in several offshore jurisdictions and US Spendthrift trusts .
In such a trust assets are ordinarily held to pay an income to the beneficiary . The beneficiary may also have access to capital of the trust with the trustee 's permission . The right to receive income from a trust would ordinarily be an asset in the hands of the beneficiary and could be sold , thwarting the intention of the donor to spread the gift over the recipient 's lifetime . Additionally on a bankruptcy the right to the income would be sold by the beneficiary 's trustee in bankruptcy .
To give protection to beneficiaries , a protective trust automatically converts into a discretionary trust , under which the beneficiary has no right to the income , if anything is done which breaches a condition specified in the document creating the trust .
The establishment of this discretionary trust is ordinarily exempt from the charge to UK inheritance tax on the establishment of discretionary trusts .
Such protective trusts have a longstanding history . To reduce the verbose definitions that had previously to be recited in the establishing documents of a protective trust , in England and Wales s33 of the Trustee Act 1925 ( and equivalent legislation in other jurisdictions ) provides that this protection will arise in any trust described as a `` protective trust '' in its trust deed .
Protective trusts are subject to challenge under creditor protection legislation as are any other forms of asset-protection . However many jurisdictions do not permit a trust to be broken where a debtor who remains a discretionary beneficiary only under a trust and can not access the fund without the exercise of the trustees ' discretion in their favour .

The Glogovac Monastery ( ) is a Serbian Orthodox monastery dedicated to Saint George and located at the village of Babići near Šipovo in the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina . It is the only monastery in this area . The original building was destroyed in 1463 when this region was occupied by Ottoman Turks .
First reconstruction
Omer-paša Latas started reconstructing this monastery by building a church in 1867 . Bishop Dionisije Milijević put this church into operation in 1869 . According to one of the stories , enslaved Serbs asked the Sultan of Turkey to allow them to re-build this holy place . Permission was granted under condition that church bells were not heard . This is the reason the monastery is built between steep hills .
Second reconstruction
Glogovac is the spiritual focal point for this area . Seventy five years after the monastery was re-built it was destroyed again . This time it was done by the Ustaše and this happened on October 14 , 1944 . Around 1960 , the monastery was sufficiently re-built to be used as a parish church . In 1999 , complete reconstruction was started and it was finished in 2005 . Left of the main building , work on building St. George 's camp has started . Another project underway is the finishing of a building for pilgrims .

The 2018 presidential campaign of Ksenia Sobchak was announced in a YouTube video , on 19 October 2017 .
Sobchak from the beginning of their campaign billed themselves as the `` candidate against all '' . In Russia the option to vote for `` none of the above '' ( literally `` against all '' ) on a federal level ( i.e . in presidential elections and elections to the State Duma ) was abolished in 2006 .
Announcement and nomination
Rumors about the nomination of Ksenia Sobchak in the 2018 election appeared a month before they officially announced that they would run for president .
Sobchak announced that they would run for President on 19 October 2017 , in a YouTube video . In the video , Sobchak said they are the candidate `` against all '' , because since the 2004 election , the `` against all '' option ( or `` none of the above '' as it is more commonly known in English-speaking countries ) has been excluded from the ballot , and Sobchak wants to give people the opportunity to again vote `` against all '' . At the same time , Sobchak said they will withdraw their candidacy if Alexey Navalny is registered as a candidate by the Central Election Commission .
Originally Sobchak put themselves forward as an independent candidate . In this case they would have had to collect at least 300,000 signatures in order to be admitted to the election . Soon after , however , Sobchak 's campaign team said that would be nominated by a political party , namely the People 's Freedom Party or Civic Initiative .
On 15 November 2017 , it was announced that Sobchak will be nominated by Civil Initiative at its convention in December .
On 23 December 2017 , at the Civic Initiative convention Ksenia Sobchak was officially nominated for president . On the same day , Sobchak joined the party .
Campaign
Regional headquarters
Kseniya Sobchak 's presidential campaign includes opening regional headquarters and holding meetings with voters in different cities . The opening of the first regional headquarters was held on 29 November 2017 in Rostov-on-Don . At one point during the campaign , the headquarters was vandalized , with even graffiti which included words such as `` Jew is not a President '' being scrawled on a wall .
People
Campaign staff
Ksenia Sobchak 's campaign manager is Igor Malashenko . In 1996 , Malashenko worked in the election staff of Boris Yeltsin , where they were engaged in working with the media .
Andrey Movchan and Vladislav Inozemtsev were responsible for Sobchak 's economic program .
Also involved in the campaign was Vitaly Shkliarov , who had experience working as an advisor for political campaigns abroad ( including campaigns for Angela Merkel , Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders ) .
Policy advisors
Sobchak 's chief political consultant was their colleague from television channel TV Rain Stanislav Belkovsky .
Communications
Sobchak 's press secretary was Ksenia Chudinova .
Political consultant Vitaly Shklyarov was responsible for Sobchak 's online campaign . Videos and the YouTube channel are managed by filmmaker Sergey Kalvarsky . Rustem Adagamov is responsible for the social media campaign .
Alexey Sitnikov was initially responsible for collecting signatures and working with volunteers , however , they and their team soon quit .
Political positions
Economic views
Sobchak is a supporter of free-market capitalism and privatization . Outlining their economic views , they write :
Views on patriotism and nationalism
Sobchak describes themselves as a patriot and a nationalist . However , they believe that much of the patriotism in Russia today is artificial . They write , contrasting patriotism unfavorably with the situation in Israel : `` Israel , in my opinion , is a hymn to the power of the human spirit ... Patriotism , not imposed from above , but born within a person . And that 's another amazing thing . This sense of the importance of your life for the state [ in Israel ] is created by many more small , as if imperceptible actions ... And these little details are much more valuable than all the spirit-lifting speeches on May Day and Victory Day . And I sit , listen and feel bitter from the fact that in my home country all this is not '' .
Views on feminism
Sobchak describes themselves as a feminist . In their manifesto , they deride the lack of women 's representation in industry and politics . `` Almost 500 heavy professions in Russia are officially closed to women . But among all the others - the salary of a woman is almost 30 % less than that of a man . Among the most important companies in the country , women head only about 5 % . ... In any case , half the country 's population deserves a female voice for the first time in 14 years in these allegedly male games . ''
On the status of Crimea
Ksenia Sobchak said that the unconditional return of Crimea to Ukraine is impossible . However , they also said that , having annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 , Russia violated the 1994 Budapest Memorandum ; they claimed on 24 October 2017 that `` Under these agreements , we agreed that Crimea is Ukrainian , which is the most important to me '' . Sobchak stressed that they did not consider the issue with Crimea resolved . `` I believe that these things need to be discussed , it is very important to discuss them .... look for some ways out . '' They also added that `` the most important thing that Russia and Ukraine should do now is to restore our friendship at any cost .

Sobchak has said that if they become president , they will remove the body of Vladimir Lenin from Red Square , since , in their opinion , this is an indicator of a `` medieval way of life in the country ... so the corpse of Lenin must be removed from Red Square . '' Sobchak 's proposal has led to widespread criticism , with Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov stating : `` It 's tragic for the country when Ksenia and the like appear , who do not respect the will of this great country . ''
Developments
Sobchak , as a reporter , confronted Putin on December 14 at their annual press conference . They asked them why there was a strong lack of political competition and why Navalny is not being permitted to run . In their response , Putin criticized Sobchack 's candidacy asking , “ You 're running under the slogan 'Against All ' . Is that really a positive programme ? What are you offering ? ”
Sobchak traveled to the United States in order to make an appeal to expatriate voters living there .
On February 28 , during the first debate with several candidates , Sobchak chastised Vladimir Zhirinovsky for interrupting Sergey Baburin . In reply , Zhirinovsky angrily uttered expletives at Sobchak ( reportedly , amongst other pejoratives , calling them a `` fucking whore '' and a `` crazy bitch '' ) . In response , Sobchak threw water at Zhirinovsky . On March 4 , while they were campaigning in Moscow in sub-zero temperatures , Sobchak was drenched with water by a supporter of Zhirinovsky , who was intending to retaliate for Sobchak 's interaction with Zhirinovsky at the debate .
On March 15 , Sobchak announced that after the election they would be forming a new political party named the `` Party of Changes '' . They will partner with Gennady Gudkov to create the party . On the day of the election , Sobchak visited , and got into an argument with Navalny , who they urged to join them party .

State Route 320 ( SR 320 ) is a short north–south state highway in western Ohio , a U.S. state . The southern terminus of SR 320 is at U.S. Route 35 ( US 35 ) approximately southeast of New Paris , south of US 35 's eastern junction with Interstate 70 ( I-70 ) . The northern terminus of the state highway is located in New Paris at a signalized intersection with SR 121 .
This L-shaped two-lane highway was first designated in the early 1930s along the stretch between Preble County Road 335 ( CR 335 ) and SR 121 . The highway was extended some three decades later along the former US 35 to its current southern terminus when the U.S. highway was re-routed onto the newly constructed I-70 freeway nearby . The north–south portion of SR 320 between New Westville and New Paris runs in parallel to the east of the Indiana state line by a distance of just more than . No direct access is provided between SR 320 and I-70/US 35 . Consequently , one may access I-70 westbound from SR 320 via US 35 . To get to I-70 eastbound from SR 320 , one must follow CR 335 westbound into Indiana , where it becomes known as Eaton Pike , and connect to US 40 to access the freeway in the eastbound direction .
Route description
SR 320 is located entirely within the northwestern corner of Preble County . The route begins at its intersection with US 35 south of where the U.S. route converges with I-70 at the Interstate 's westernmost interchange in Ohio in Jackson Township . SR 320 travels to the west-northwest through rural farmland prior to bending to the west into the hamlet of New Westville , where the highway encounters a primarily residential area . At a four-way stop intersection there , SR 320 turns to the north , taking over for New Westville Road while CR 335 is the roadway that departs the intersection to the west . SR 320 now turns to the north-northwest , passing amidst a number of houses prior to crossing over the I-70/US 35 concurrency . To the north of the grade separation , SR 320 travels due north , and is bounded by homes and a large commercial facility on the west side , and farmland on the east side , with some batches of trees appearing along the way . It intersects US 40 , then proceeds into Jefferson Township . A combination of woods and homes appear along the west side of the highway at this point , with more farmland abutting it to the east . After a short reverse curve that takes the highway to the northeast and then back to the north , SR 320 encounters forested land on both sides . Upon emerging from the wooded terrain , the highway enters New Paris . As it follows Washington Street northerly through the village , SR 320 passes amidst a blend of commercial businesses and residences leading up to its endpoint in downtown New Paris at a signalized intersection where it meets SR 121 . This state highway is not included within the National Highway System .
History
SR 320 first appeared in 1932 , occupying the current stretch between its intersection with CR 335 ( the former routing of US 35 , which was originally designated as SR 11 ) and its current northern terminus at SR 121 in New Paris .
When the current I-70 freeway was constructed going eastward from Indiana into Ohio in 1962 , US 35 was re-routed onto the freeway . As a result , SR 320 was extended southeasterly by approximately along the former US 35 to the current junction of the two routes .

Ming C. Lowe ( born 1945 ) is an American painter of large-scale contemporary works on canvas and a fine art photographer . They emerged from the most embryonic 1960s rock 'n ' roll scenes to become a unique voice in the Southern California desert , where their home was a gathering place for like-minded , creatively driven individuals of all genres of the arts seeking a place of peace and inspiration amid the turbulence of what was called the counter-culture .
After their work attracted and served as a source of inspiration for the likes of Eric Burdon of the Animals , Paul Butterfield , Sterling Morrison of the Velvet Underground , American Indian guitar legend Jesse Ed Davis and James Gurley of Big Brother and the Holding Company , Lowe moved from Palm Desert to the nearby Santa Rosa Mountains and began producing photographic art inspired by visits to working and abandoned Midwest steel mills ; the living , breathing waterfronts of San Diego ; the juke joints of the Mississippi Delta , and images of the 9/11 catastrophes in New York and Washington , D.C ..
The significance and vitality of their art is growing in national recognition as the underground they once nurtured becomes more mainstream . Today , their work can be seen in the catalogues of Fortune 500 business and national museums and art galleries .
Biography
Lowe was born in Washington , D.C . Them mother , Choral Lowe , named their Ming after their attraction to Ming Dynasty art . It may have seemed a strange , non-conformist act in 1945 mainstream America , but Lowe considered it their mother 's greatest gift .
Lowe 's grandfather , a successful business person , owned homes in Salt Lake City , Utah , and the beach town of La Jolla , California . Lowe grew up in both cities , excelling in swimming and tennis . But they were largely ignored by their parents . There was never a breakfast before school . No money for lunch . No toys . No movies . No hugs . No `` I love yous . '' A different school every year . Lowe tested with an I.Q . of 143 and showed early signs of artistic talent . But they were not encouraged to pursue any of their passions . Them parents divorced when they were 12 , launching Lowe on a journey of boarding schools and public schools from Arcadia , California to Las Vegas to Salt Lake as their mom remarried , divorced and remarried again . Left alone with their grandparents in Salt Lake City , Lowe easily passed the University of Utah 's college boards exams , but dropped out of the 11th grade when their grandparents went to Europe . Lowe then headed west to California . They wanted to be a Beatnik . They had their own car and a pack of unfiltered Camel cigarettes .
Birth of a counter-culture
Lowe returned to La Jolla in 1961 as a shy 15½-year-old red head with a passion for more cerebral jazz , folk and blues . They met a group of guys from Windansea Beach and joined them in the youth culture they created around surfing and beer bashes . With their fake ID , they rented a studio apartment in Pacific Beach and paid the rent with a $ 100 child support check from their father . They supplemented their income working at the first Hobie Surfboard Shop in San Diego County for Chuck Hasley , a former school teacher who would lead the Windansea team to victories in surf competitions . Lowe , who answered their fan mail , also participated in the surfer group , the Mac Meda Destruction Company founded by Jack Macpherson . They got pregnant just before the city discovered they were a 17-year-old truant . They moved to Palm Desert , where their mother and stepfather were publishing Desert Magazine . Them mother signed their marriage license and gave them a $ 100 gift . They divorced in 1966 after having two daughters , Sloane and Portia Perry . Lowe retained their married name , Ming Perry , and remained a part of the La Jolla scene while raising their daughters as a single parent . Tom Wolfe spent a summer in La Jolla and skimmed the surface of its `` underground society '' in their 1965 book , `` The Pump House Gang . '' Lowe was more integral to the real scene , helping their friend , Anchovie Barça , turn the Hippodrome ice skating rink into the Fillmore West of San Diego . They had a party with a blues band playing in their living room and police raided it for disturbing the peace . Twenty-one of Lowe 's friends were arrested after police reported finding marijuana and peyote in the house of `` Mrs. Ming Perry , a 21-year-old divorcee and mother of two children '' , according to the San Diego Union . Lowe recalled hearing themselves called `` the Dragon Lady '' on radio . The counter-culture became prominent across the U.S. in 1966 . Lowe was visiting a friend on the Sunset Strip when the riot broke out that inspired Stephen Stills to write `` For What It 's Worth . '' They were invited in 1967 to the Monterey Pop Festival by Cass Elliott of the Mamas and the Papas , whose boyfriend was a surfer from Windansea . They were in the front row at the Altamont Festival when the West Coast scene came to a violent end during a set by the Rolling Stones . Other prominent figures from the 1960s , including comedian Jonathan Winters , English rocker Eric Burdon , Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling Morrison , Native American guitarist Jesse Ed Davis , blues legend Taj Mahal , and actors Brad Douriff from `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest '' and Teddie Markland from `` Wanda Nevada '' , began showing up at their back door after Ming bought a house in Palm Desert in 1967 . The now posh destination was still part of the desert frontier when Ming built their own studio there . When Palm Springs had its own rock festival in 1969 , about 60 friends slept on the floor and roof of Ming 's house . Burdon called it `` a great meeting place for artists and travelers attracted to the desert . ''
The art
Lowe is a self-taught artist . An experience they had at a friend 's art class at age 8 influenced them to pursue art . Perhaps because of their parents ' lack of support , Lowe did not consider themselves a real artist . Then , at age 29 , they had their first one-woman show at a gallery in Palm Desert . People who saw their work began giving their commissions , one of which resulted in a large-scale portrait of a Maasai warrior . Them portraits , ranging from jazz and rock subjects to the Utah execution of Gary Gilmore , often revealed a punk boldness and strength . They had their first show of paintings in 1978 in Long Beach , California , followed by many Palm Springs-area exhibitions . Them international collectors included many of their famous friends . But Lowe always sought to duplicate the feel of that childhood art class . There was an energy in that large , empty room with one big painting on a large easel . They built their own gallery on their Palm Desert property in the mid-1980s and captured that energy by placing their large paintings on big canvases in open rooms . Them gallery also served the community with free screenings of surreal films by Luis Buñuel , attracting the likes of avant garde composer Ernst Krenek and underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger . Soon , Lowe was recognized as a vital artist by reviewers and a unique personality by a newspaper columnist who covered Palm Springs celebrities . When they needed more space and privacy than Palm Desert could afford , Lowe moved to the mountain community of Pinyon and used their self-taught architectural and construction skills to design and build a multi-dimensional house and furniture to give them home the energy their art demanded . With their art now properly housed , Lowe gained the confidence to travel and experiment in photography . They were in the top floor of the Hotel Washington across from the White House when a terrorist-piloted jet crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11 . They were photographing the smoke from the crash when President Bush 's helicopter emerged from the smoke to land on the White House lawn , giving Lowe a powerful image . Recognizing the history of the moment , Lowe got into the restricted areas of Ground Zero in New York to capture the scope of the national disaster . They then juxtaposed the photos with images of Muslim culture taken from their international travels for a compelling show that they titled `` Here and there . 911 . ''
Fascinated by the geometric spirituality of their images , Lowe began a cross-country tour of steel mills and industrial Americana after designing their own custom motor home . Many of the anthropological-yet-ballet-like images they photographed were pledged to U.S. Steel in Gary , Ind . They were then commissioned in 2006 to photograph the San Diego waterfront for the Port Authority 's Art in Public Places program . The year-long project resulted in a 30-photograph essay , `` Shift Change : The Working Waterfront '' , which opened at the Balboa Photography Museum . It has been shown at museums throughout San Diego County .

Eugenio Principe ( born February 26 , 1967 ) is a Canadian sports reporter and broadcaster , who is the current host of Edmonton Oilers broadcasts on Sportsnet . They are best known for their frequent use of puns and props during their pre-game segments .
Born in Edmonton to Italian immigrants , Principe began their broadcasting career in 1987 and became a full-time sportscaster in 1990 . They anchored various sports programs in Winnipeg and Toronto before returning to Edmonton in 1998 to host Oilers broadcasts for CKEM-TV ( then known as A-Channel ) . Principe continued to host Oilers games after joining Sportsnet in 2001 .
Early life and career
Principe was born in Edmonton to Gina and Franco Principe , who were immigrants from Italy . Their mother Gina was a seamstress , while their father Franco was a carpenter . Principe attended Austin O'Brien Catholic High School and became interested in sports broadcasting as a teenager . This led them to study broadcasting for two years at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology ( NAIT ) before graduating in 1987 .
Principe began their first work placement at CFJC-TV in Kamloops , later moving to Grande Prairie to work as a videographer for CFRN-TV . After a year and a half in Grande Prairie , they became a reporter for CFCN-TV in Lethbridge , eventually transitioning to a full-time sports reporter in the summer of 1990 .
Principe later moved to Global-owned CKND-TV in Winnipeg , spending three years as host of the station 's Winnipeg Jets broadcasts and the co-anchor of Sportsline , a half-hour sports show . In 1995 , they were hired by Global to work for CIII-TV in Toronto , where they continued to host Sportsline . Given the opportunity to cover their hometown team , Principe returned to Edmonton in August 1998 to become the host of CKEM-TV 's Edmonton Oilers broadcasts , as well as its evening sports show .
Work with Sportsnet
Principe joined Sportsnet in October 2001 , as the host of the network 's Edmonton Oilers broadcasts . In March 2002 , they called their first two National Hockey Leagues games as a play-by-play announcer when they filled in for regular announcer Kevin Quinn . Principe travelled to Dubai in 2005 to film a documentary covering the Dubai Mighty Camels of the Emirates Ice Hockey League .
During the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs , Principe was scheduled to cover only the first round matchup between the Oilers and the Detroit Red Wings , before leaving for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany , since the Oilers were unlikely to advance . However , after the Oilers won the series , they were held back to cover the second round . When the Oilers advanced to the third round , Principe was given a choice of staying to cover the Oilers , which they were already `` pretty entrenched in '' and where `` fellow Italian Fernando Pisani was lighting it up '' , or fly to Germany to cover the World Cup , which was a `` pure dream '' , especially with the Italian national football team in contention for the cup and their wife being German . They ultimately left the decision to Sportsnet , who had them stay in Edmonton . The Oilers ended up losing the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals , while the Italian team won the World Cup .
During the 2010 Winter Olympics , they covered men 's hockey for Canada 's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium .
Use of puns
As a host of Oilers broadcasts , Principe is well known for their use of puns and skits during their pre-game segments . According to Principe , they were inspired by fellow broadcaster Ron MacLean , and began using puns as a way to uplift fans during the 2006–07 NHL season . The season followed the Oilers ' defeat in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals , and included a stretch where the Oilers had won only two of their last 20 games . Their segments were well received by fans and colleagues , which encouraged them to continue their unique pre-game segments in subsequent seasons .
On October 30 , 2011 , Principe began one of their segments dressed as a hot dog , saying that they `` like such a wiener '' for accidentally dressing up a day before Halloween . They wore the costume for the rest of the game , including during an interview with Oilers assistant coach Kelly Buchberger , where Principe said `` [ t ] his may be the first time in history a hot dog has interviewed a burger . '' In January 2017 , one of their segments had them wearing a Donald Trump mask and making various Trump-related puns during a broadcast that coincided with Trump 's inauguration . That same year , during a pre-game commemoration of the Edmonton Police Service 's 125th anniversary , Principe made several police-related puns , before being handcuffed by an officer , who informed them that they had exceeded the `` legal limit for puns '' and was being sent to the `` pun-itentiary '' .
Personal life
Principe is married to Karen Principe , who they met during their time in Winnipeg ; together they have three children . A former dental hygienist , Karen Principe was elected to Edmonton City Council as the councillor for Ward tastawiyiniwak in 2021 .

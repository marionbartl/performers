WLUM-FM ( 102.1 MHz ) is a commercial radio station in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . The station airs an Alternative rock music format branded as `` FM 102/1 '' ( previously `` FM_102/1 '' ) . Its studios are located in Menomonee Falls and the transmitter site is in Milwaukee 's North Side at Lincoln Park .
The station is owned by the estate of former Green Bay Packer Willie Davis and their company , All-Pro Broadcasting . All-Pro has owned the station since 1979 . WLUM is run as a partnership with co-owned WZTI and Shamrock Broadcasting 's WLDB as a group called the Milwaukee Radio Alliance .
History
WAWA-FM
WMKE ( 102.1 FM ) launched in September 1960 , broadcasting from studios located on North Avenue in Milwaukee with a format consisting primarily of Broadway show tunes . The owners boasted that they were the nation 's first `` all-tape radio station '' , meaning that all programming would originate from reel-to-reel tape or other tape formats , rather than phonograph records , as they believed tape delivered higher quality .
The station was later sold and became WAWA-FM in 1964 . The new format featured black gospel music and also simulcast the rhythm and blues format of the then-sister station WAWA ( 1590 AM ) throughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s .
Former Packer legend Willie Davis purchased and split the programming of the two stations on February 14 , 1979 , switching WAWA-FM to WLUM ( short for We Love YoU Milwaukee ! ) , and giving 102.1 FM its own distinct format focusing on disco music . At the time that WAWA-FM became WLUM , they also became the second station in Milwaukee to adopt the Disco format , as WNUW had already beat them to it in October 1978 , even though their success would be short lived by August 1979 .
The daytime-only 1590 AM , still WAWA , later picked up the WLUM call letters . The AM station was long hampered by a weak signal , and when All Pro Broadcasting purchased stronger station WMVP ( 1290 AM ) , the format and programming moved there . As a result , 1590 AM went dark in 1988 , and its broadcast license turned in to the FCC .
The `` Hot 102 '' era
WLUM has gone through many changes and tweaks over the years since its debut in 1979 . In all incarnations since , they have carried the WLUM call sign . In the beginning , WLUM played Disco and Soul hits , though a different format than its AM sister station . In 1982 , the station began adding more Urban music , and by the summer of 1983 , the station 's format morphed into a Rhythmic Contemporary Hits presentation with the brandings `` WLUM FM 102 '' , `` WLUM 102 Milwaukees Hot FM '' , `` Club 102 WLUM '' , `` Power 102 WLUM '' , `` WLUM 102 FM '' , and then following later as `` Hot 102 WLUM '' as they aired a mix of dance music ( including Freestyle , House and Club Imports ) and Top 40 hits ( including Rock and Modern/Alternative tracks ) . By 1989 , WLUM was featuring shows like `` Casey 's Top 40 '' and `` American Dance Traxx '' as it began to shift further towards a Dance-leaning direction that was loosely patterned after Power 106 in Los Angeles under the guidance of veteran Rhythmic program director and future consultant Rick Thomas before moving on to launch XHITZ/San Diego 's Rhythmic format in April 1990 . It was also during this period that Bubba the Love Sponge briefly did an airshift at Hot 102 .
By late 1991 , WLUM evolved into a straightforward CHR presentation . More hip-hop was added to the playlist by the following year , to better compete with upstart rival V100.7 for the urban audience . By late 1993 , it began shifting back to a Dance-leaning direction , billing themselves as `` Hot 102 WLUM , Milwaukee 's Party Station '' . This lasted until the Summer of 1994 , when it shifted back to mainstream Top 40 .
`` 102ONE '' and various rock incarnations
By 1994 , WLUM began tweaking their on-air presentation . Hip-hop was slowly being phased out and more modern rock was added to the playlist , due to Davis ' desire to distance their station from the violent image of most rap and hip-hop music , after finding out that the station had begun to carry a nightly hour of uncensored music after the FCC 's `` safe harbor '' regulations were not in effect ( a record homicide count in Milwaukee and several area violent crimes also played into the re-shift ) . This began to occur in earnest on December 1 , 1993 , when Wauwatosa West High School assistant principal Dale Breitlow was murdered by a former student , and the station immediately pulled Dr. Dre 's `` Dre Day '' and Eazy-E 's `` Real Compton City G 's '' in reaction , dropping their usual music and allowing those affected to call-in about how the shooting affected them . The modern rock music was well received by listeners , and by October of that year , the station adopted modern rock full-time , as `` New Rock 102ONE '' .
Over the years , the format underwent much tweaking . After adding more classic rock tracks to the playlist , the station began a brief run with an adult album alternative format on June 23 , 1998 . The move was unsuccessful , so in December , WLUM switched to hard rock with the syndicated Mancow Muller in the morning . They initially avoided much of the then-popular nu metal music that WLZR played , but added a great deal to the playlist by 2001 . Nonetheless , they were consistently a distant second to market leader WLZR .
`` Independent . Alternative . Radio . ''
As a straight-ahead rock station , WLUM experienced some of its lowest ratings levels ever , with the bottom coming after the September 11 attacks , which caused many rock stations to shift quickly from hard rock tracks inappropriate for play in the aftermath and change away from aggressive formats . In March 2002 , WLUM began making more changes . Mancow 's morning show was dropped , along with most of the hard rock music on the playlist , and modern rock music returned to the playlist . By September , the station was once again a full-time reporter to alternative rock airplay charts for radio industry trade magazines . The station still experienced low ratings , as it worked to shake its male-oriented hard rock image . The station made heavy use of consultants who crafted a rather tight playlist . In March 2003 , the Indianapolis-based Bob and Tom was added in the morning drive to compete against Bob & Brian up the dial on WLZR , but its older target audience proved wildly incompatible for the rest of WLUM 's younger-skewing broadcast day .
The Bob and Tom agreement ran out in 2005 , and a locally oriented morning show , `` Kramp and Adler '' , debuted on St. Patrick 's Day . This was a sign of more changes to come . On July 10 , 2006 , WLUM began stunting as `` Quick 102 '' and started playing five-second song clips back-to-back . At the same time , via on-air promos , they poked fun at themselves and their many failed on-air tweaks and changes over the years . At 5:00 PM the next day , the modern rock format was relaunched with a new programming and on-air staff in place . The station admitted past mistakes , then announced their `` independence '' , stating they were now free from corporate practices and radio consultants and pledged a stronger dedication to their listeners and the local community . As part of the new direction , Program Director Jacent Jackson rolled out a modified alternative rock format with a more diverse playlist , featuring , among other things , more indie rock . The first song after the relaunch was `` Guerrilla Radio '' by Rage Against the Machine . Jackson also added new DJs to the airstaff such as Michelle Rutkowski from WKQX in Chicago , and changed the name of the station to `` FM 102.1 '' with the slogan , 'Independent . Alternative . Radio . ' The station also removed their last remaining syndicated show , Loveline , vowing to be 100 % local in their on-air presentation .
`` Sounds Different ''
Later , the station sponsored a contest to name a new alternative rock festival on the Summerfest grounds that took place in June 2010 . It became known as the `` Verge Music Festival '' . During this time , the station also adjusted their positioning statement from 'Independent . Alternative . Radio ' to 'Sounds Different . '
In 2014 , Program Director Jacent Jackson departed to program KITS in San Francisco and Michelle Rutkowski took over the PD reigns . Current specialty shows consist of `` FM 102/1 Retro Brunch '' - three hours of Classic Alternative titles Sunday mornings from 7-10 am , `` Indie Soundcheck '' ( Sunday nights 8-11 pm ) with Ryan Miller , `` Neighborhood Watch '' - an hour of local Milwaukee music hosted by Ian McCain Sunday nights at 11 pm . The current full-time line-up includes Adler ( 6-10 am ) , Michelle Rutkowski ( 10 am-2 pm ) , Ian McCain ( 2-7 pm ) , and Schroeder ( 7 pm-midnight ) with the current part-time line-up consisting of Kelly Katona , Ryan Miller , and Schroeder .

Willard Barrows ( – ) was an American civil engineer .
Willard Barrows was born in in Monson , Massachusetts . Their early youth was spent in New England , after which they became a teacher in Elizabeth , New Jersey , but this occupation they soon relinquished for the profession of civil engineering . They accomplished the government survey of the lands vacated by the removal of the Choctaw nation in Mississippi , finishing that work in 1835 . Later they explored Cedar River , which at that time was scarcely known , and in 1837 was engaged on the first surveys of Iowa . In 1840 they surveyed the islands in the Mississippi River between Rock Island and Quincy . During the suspension of the surveys they settled in Rockingham ; but in 1843 , when the surveys were resumed , they were sent into the Kickapoo country . From 1845 until 1850 they were engaged in government work and on county surveys in Iowa . During the latter year they made a journey to the Rocky Mountains , and afterward was connected with a banking firm in Davenport , Iowa . They published several accounts of their experiences , including Barrows 's New Map of Iowa , with Notes ( 1854 ) , and Historical Sketch of Scott County ( 1859 ) . Willard Barrows died on January 3 , 1868 in Davenport , Iowa .

Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy ( ETS ) is a surgical procedure in which a portion of the sympathetic nerve trunk in the thoracic region is destroyed . ETS is used to treat excessive sweating in certain parts of the body ( focal hyperhidrosis ) , facial blushing , Raynaud 's disease and reflex sympathetic dystrophy . By far the most common complaint treated with ETS is sweaty palms ( palmar hyperhidrosis ) . The intervention is controversial and illegal in some jurisdictions . Like any surgical procedure , it has risks ; the endoscopic sympathetic block ( ESB ) procedure and those procedures that affect fewer nerves have lower risks .
Sympathectomy physically destroys relevant nerves anywhere in either of the two sympathetic trunks , which are long chains of nerve ganglia located bilaterally along the vertebral column ( a localisation which entails a low risk of injury ) responsible for various important aspects of the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . Each nerve trunk is broadly divided into three regions : cervical ( neck ) , thoracic ( chest ) , and lumbar ( lower back ) . The most common area targeted in sympathectomy is the upper thoracic region , that part of the sympathetic chain lying between the first and fifth thoracic vertebrae .
Indications
The most common indications for thoracic sympathectomy are focal hyperhidrosis ( that specifically affects the hands and underarms ) , Raynaud syndrome , and facial blushing when accompanied by focal hyperhidrosis . It may also be used to treat bromhidrosis , although this usually responds to non-surgical treatments , and sometimes people with olfactory reference syndrome present to surgeons requesting sympathectomy .
There are reports of ETS being used to achieve cerebral revascularization for people with moyamoya disease , and to treat headaches , hyperactive bronchial tubes , long QT syndrome , social phobia , anxiety , and other conditions .
Surgical procedure
ETS involves dissection of the main sympathetic trunk in the upper thoracic region of the sympathetic nervous system , irreparably disrupting neural messages that ordinarily would travel to many different organs , glands and muscles . It is via those nerves that the brain is able to make adjustments to the body in response to changing conditions in the environment , fluctuating emotional states , level of exercise , and other factors to maintain the body in its ideal state ( see homeostasis ) .
Because these nerves also regulate conditions like excessive blushing or sweating , which the procedure is designed to eliminate , the normative functions these physiological mechanisms perform will be disabled or significantly impaired by sympathectomy .
There is much disagreement among ETS surgeons about the best surgical method , optimal location for nerve dissection , and the nature and extent of the consequent primary effects and side effects . When performed endoscopically as is usually the case , the surgeon penetrates the chest cavity making multiple incisions about the diameter of a straw between ribs . This allows the surgeon to insert the video camera ( endoscope ) in one hole and a surgical instrument in another . The operation is accomplished by dissecting the nerve tissue of the main sympathetic chain .
Another technique , the clamping method , also referred to as 'endoscopic sympathetic blockade ' ( ESB ) employs titanium clamps around the nerve tissue , and was developed as an alternative to older methods in an unsuccessful attempt to make the procedure reversible . Technical reversal of the clamping procedure must be performed within a short time after clamping ( estimated at a few days or weeks at most ) , and a recovery , evidence indicates , will not be complete .
Physical , mental and emotional effects
Sympathectomy works by disabling part of the autonomic nervous system ( and thereby disrupting its signals from the brain ) , through surgical intervention , in the expectation of removing or alleviating the designated problem . Many non-ETS doctors have found this practice questionable chiefly because its purpose is to destroy functionally disordered , yet anatomically typical nerves .
Exact results of ETS are impossible to predict , because of considerable anatomic variation in nerve function from one patient to the next , and also because of variations in surgical technique . The autonomic nervous system is not anatomically exact and connections might exist which are unpredictably affected when the nerves are disabled . This problem was demonstrated by a significant number of patients who underwent sympathectomy at the same level for hand sweating , but who then presented a reduction or elimination of feet sweating , in contrast to others who were not affected in this way . No reliable operation exists for foot sweating except lumbar sympathectomy , at the opposite end of the sympathetic chain .
Thoracic sympathectomy will change many bodily functions , including sweating , vascular responses , heart rate , heart stroke volume , thyroid , baroreflex , lung volume , pupil dilation , skin temperature and other aspects of the autonomic nervous system , like the essential fight-or-flight response . It reduces the physiological responses to strong emotions , such as fear and laughter , diminishes the body 's physical reaction to both pain and pleasure , and inhibits cutaneous sensations such as goose bumps .
A large study of psychiatric patients treated with this surgery showed significant reductions in fear , alertness and arousal . Arousal is essential to consciousness , in regulating attention and information processing , memory and emotion .
ETS patients are being studied using the autonomic failure protocol headed by David Goldstein , M.D . Ph.D. , senior investigator at the U.S National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . They have documented loss of thermoregulatory function , cardiac denervation , and loss of vasoconstriction .
Recurrence of the original symptoms due to nerve regeneration or nerve sprouting can occur within the first year post surgery . Nerve sprouting , or abnormal nerve growth after damage or injury to the nerves can cause other further damage . Sprouting sympathetic nerves can form connections with sensory nerves , and lead to pain conditions that are mediated by the SNS . Every time the system is activated , it is translated into pain . This sprouting and its action can lead to Frey 's syndrome , a recognized after effect of sympathectomy , when the growing sympathetic nerves innervate salivary glands , leading to excessive sweating regardless of environmental temperature through olfactory or gustatory stimulation .
In addition , patients have reported lethargy , depression , weakness , limb swelling , lack of libido , decreased physical and mental reactivity , oversensitivity to sound , light and stress and weight gain . ( British Journal of Surgery 2004 ; 91 : 264–269 )
Risks
ETS has both the normal risks of surgery , such as bleeding and infection , conversion to open chest surgery , and several specific risks , including permanent and unavoidable alteration of nerve function . It is reported that a number of patients - 9 since 2010 , mostly young women - have died during this procedure due to major intrathoracic bleeding and cerebral disruption . Bleeding during and following the operation may be significant in up to 5 % of patients . Pneumothorax ( collapsed lung ) can occur ( 2 % of patients ) . Compensatory hyperhidrosis ( or reflex hyperhidrosis ) is common over the long term . The rates of severe compensatory sweating vary widely between studies , ranging from as high as 92 % of patients . Of those patients that develop this side effect , about a quarter in one study said it was a major and disabling problem .
A severe possible consequence of thoracic sympathectomy is corposcindosis ( split-body syndrome ) , in which the patient feels that they are living in two separate bodies , because sympathetic nerve function has been divided into two distinct regions , one dead , and the other hyperactive .
Additionally , the following side effects have all been reported by patients : Chronic muscular pain , numbness and weakness of the limbs , Horner 's Syndrome , anhidrosis ( inability to sweat ) , hyperthermia ( exacerbated by anhidrosis and systemic thermoregulatory dysfunction ) , neuralgia , paraesthesia , fatigue and amotivationality , breathing difficulties , substantially diminished physiological/chemical reaction to internal and environmental stimuli , somatosensory malfunction , aberrant physiological reaction to stress and exertion , Raynaud 's disease ( albeit a possible indication for surgery ) , reflex hyperhidrosis , altered/erratic blood pressure and circulation , defective fight or flight response system , loss of adrenaline , eczema and other skin conditions resulting from exceptionally dry skin , rhinitis , gustatory sweating ( also known as Frey 's syndrome ) .
Other long-term adverse effects include :
Ultrastructural changes in the cerebral artery wall induced by long-term sympathetic denervation
Sympathectomy eliminates the psychogalvanic reflex
Cervical sympathectomy reduces the heterogeneity of oxygen saturation in small cerebrocortical veins
Sympathetic denervation is one of the causes of Mönckeberg 's sclerosis
T2-3 sympathectomy suppressed baroreflex control of heart rate in the patients with palmar hyperhidrosis . The baroreflex response for maintaining cardiovascular stability is suppressed in the patients who received the ETS .
Exertional heat stroke .
Morphofunctional changes in the myocardium following sympathectomy .
Other side effects are the inability to raise the heart rate sufficiently during exercise with instances requiring an artificial pacemaker after developing bradycardia being reported as a consequence of the surgery .
The Finnish Office for Health Care Technology Assessment concluded more than a decade ago in a 400-page systematic review that ETS is associated with an unusually high number of significant immediate and long-term adverse effects .
Quoting the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare statement : `` The method can give permanent side effects that in some cases will first become obvious only after some time . One of the side effects might be increased perspiration on different places on your body . Why and how this happens is still unknown . According to the research available about 25-75 % of all patients can expect more or less serious perspiration on different places on their body , such as the trunk and groin area , this is Compensatory sweating '' .
In 2003 , ETS was banned in its birthplace , Sweden , due to inherent risks , and complaints by disabled patients . In 2004 , Taiwanese health authorities banned the procedure on people under 20 years of age .
History
Sympathectomy developed in the mid-19th century , when it was learned that the autonomic nervous system runs to almost every organ , gland and muscle system in the body . It was surmised that these nerves play a role in how the body regulates many different body functions in response to changes in the external environment , and in emotion .
The first sympathectomy was performed by Alexander in 1889 . Thoracic sympathectomy has been indicated for hyperhidrosis ( excessive sweating ) since 1920 , when Kotzareff showed it would cause anhidrosis ( total inability to sweat ) from the nipple line upwards .
A lumbar sympathectomy was also developed and used to treat excessive sweating of the feet and other ailments , and typically resulted in impotence and retrograde ejaculation in men . Lumbar sympathectomy is still being offered as a treatment for plantar hyperhidrosis , or as a treatment for patients who have a bad outcome ( extreme 'compensatory sweating ' ) after thoracic sympathectomy for palmar hyperhidrosis or blushing ; however , extensive sympathectomy risks hypotension .
Endoscopic sympathectomy itself is relatively easy to perform ; however , accessing the nerve tissue in the chest cavity by conventional surgical methods was difficult , painful , and spawned several different approaches in the past . The posterior approach was developed in 1908 , and required resection ( sawing off ) of ribs . A supraclavicular ( above the collar-bone ) approach was developed in 1935 , which was less painful than the posterior , but was more prone to damaging delicate nerves and blood vessels . Because of these difficulties , and because of disabling sequelae associated with sympathetic denervation , conventional or `` open '' sympathectomy was never a popular procedure , although it continued to be practiced for hyperhidrosis , Raynaud 's disease , and various psychiatric disorders . With the brief popularization of lobotomy in the 1940s , sympathectomy fell out of favor as a form of psychosurgery .
The endoscopic version of thoracic sympathectomy was pioneered by Goren Claes and Christer Drott in Sweden in the late 1980s . The development of endoscopic `` minimally invasive '' surgical techniques has decreased the recovery time from the surgery and increased its availability . Today , ETS surgery is practiced in many countries throughout the world predominantly by vascular surgeons .

Nørregade 4 is an early 19th-century property situated in Nørregade , between Frue Plads and Gammeltorv , in the Old Town of Copenhagen , Denmark . The building was listed in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1945 .
History
18th century
The site was in the late 17th century part of two smaller properties . In Copenhagen 's first cadastre of 1689 they were listed as No . 241 and No . 242 in the city 's Klædebo Quarter . One of them was owned by Antoni Rentz ( No . 241 ) and the other one was owned by wine seller ( vintapper ) Ebbe Levesen ( No . 242 ) . In the new cadastre of 1756 , the old No . 241 was listed as No . 244 . It was by then owned by tinker ( ) Jørgen Jørgensen Wissing . The old No . 242 was listed as No . 245 and was owned by joiner Johan Pedersen ,
No . 241 and No . 242 were before 1787 merged into a single property . At the time of the 1787 census , it was home to a total of six households . Knud Holterman , a judge , resided in the building complex with their six-year-old daughter , two male servants and two maids . Gabriel Linde ( 1781-1891 ) , a retired director of the Private Royal Treasury , resided in the building with one maid . Morten Thrane Brünnich , a professor at the University of Copenhagen , resided in the building with their wife Wibecke Schou , their seven children ( aged one to 11 ) , a male servant and four maids . Friderich Ehlers , a caretaker ( pedel at the University , was also among the residents of the building . Johanne Marie Pontepican , a 65-year-old widow , resided in the building with two maids . Peder Stauning , a Famulus at the royal Commonitet , resided in the building with one maid and two lodgers ( both students ) .
The property was together with most of the other buildings in the area destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 .
19th century
The property was around the turn of the century owned by the lawyer amd ad , omostratpr Rasmus Hansen Lange . In the new cadastre of 1806 , the property was listed as No 251 . Lange had also been responsible for the construction of the building around the corner at Skindergade 44 ( then No . 2 ) as well as the property Kompagnistræde 9 and were by 1806 still the owner of this property .
During the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807 , Lange 's building was again destroyed .
The current building on the site was constructed in 1811 for distiller J. Petersen . A distillery was until 1837 operated in the building . In 1862 , its ground floor was adapted for use as a retail space .
At the time of the 1850 census , No . 251 was home to a total of 23 people . Poul Risberg , a Galoshe maker , resided on the ground floor with their wife Cicilie f. Jensen . Christian Carl Ludvig Clausen , a high-ranking civil servant in the Ministry of Defence , resided on the third floor with their Adolphine Angelica Clausen ( née Lundt= and one maid.Jacob Lackman , a merchant ( grosserer ) resided on the second floor with their wife Frederikke Kalkar and one maid . Margrete Rasmus , widow of a county manager in Nykøbing , resided on the first floor with their daughter Barbara Rasmus and one maid . Carl Knippel , a building painter , resided in the garret with their wife Wilhelmine Jessen , their 27-year-old son , three foster children ( aged aged four to 14 ) and one maid . Søren Madsen , the proprietor of a tavern in the basement , resided in the associated dwelling with their wife Magdalene Hermansen , their two children ( aged two and three ) and one maid .
20th century
The building was in 1984 acquired by bookseller Kirsten Saro . They were for many years involved in the employees-owned bookshop Atheneum in the adjacent building Nørregade 7 .
Architecture
Mørregade 4 is constructed with four storeys over a walk-out basement . The building owes its current appearance to a major renovation in 1952 , which saw the removal of a gateway as well as gabled eall dormer . The ground floor of the building is below a belt course finished with shadow joints and painted in a dark grey colour . It features a main entrance topped by a transom window with the house number and four tall , narrow shop windows . The upper part of the facade is painted in a pale yellow colour , contrasted by the white-painted window frames and a white-painted cornice . The Mansard roof is clad in red tile and features three dormer windows towards the street . A two-bay side wing extends from the rear side of the building .
Today
The building contains a shop in the ground floor and a mixture of residential apartments and office space on the upper floors .

Northern People 's Congress ( NPC ) is a political party in Nigeria . Formed in June 1949 , the party held considerable influence in the Northern Region from the 1950s until the military coup of 1966 . It was formerly a cultural organization known as Jamiyaar Mutanem Arewa .
After the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 , the NPC subsequently became a minor party .
The leader of this party was the Sardauna of Sokoto who , also , was the Premier of the Northern Region , Sir Ahmadu Bello . Sir Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was the deputy leader of the party and Prime Minister of Nigeria .
They produced the first prime minister whose office was created in 1957 , and ruled throughout the first republic ( 1963–1966 ) .
Party member Makaman Bida later became leader of the National Party of Nigeria in 1978 . S. A. Ajayi a party member was the Kwara state chairperson of NPC , a former parliamentary Secretary to Sardauna of Sokoto .

ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion is the translocation of genetic material between the ETV6 gene located on the short arm ( designated p ) of chromosome 12 at position p13.2 ( i.e . 12p13.2 ) and the NTRK3 gene located on the long arm ( designated q ) of chromosome 15 at position q25.3 ( i.e . 15q25.3 ) to create the ( 12 ; 15 ) ( p13 ; q25 ) fusion gene , ETV6-NTRK3 . This new gene consists of the 5 ' end of ETV6 fused to the 3 ' end of NTRK3 . ETV6-NTRK3 therefore codes for a chimeric oncoprotein consisting of the helix-loop-helix ( HLH ) protein dimerization domain of the ETV6 protein fused to the tyrosine kinase ( i.e . PTK ) domain of the NTRK3 protein . The ETV6 gene codes for the transcription factor protein , ETV6 , which suppresses the expression of , and thereby regulates , various genes that in mice are required for normal hematopoiesis as well as the development and maintenance of the vascular network . NTRK3 codes for Tropomyosin receptor kinase C a NT-3 growth factor receptor cell surface protein that when bound to its growth factor ligand , neurotrophin-3 , becomes an active tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine residues on , and thereby stimulates , signaling proteins that promote the growth , survival , and proliferation of their parent cells . The tyrosine kinase of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein is dysfunctional in that it is continuously active in phosphorylating tyrosine residues on , and thereby continuously stimulating , proteins that promote the growth , survival , and proliferation of their parent cells . In consequence , these cells take on malignant characteristics and are on the pathway of becoming cancerous . Indeed , the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene appears to be a critical driver of several types of cancers . It was originally identified in congenital fibrosarcoma and subsequently found in mammary secretory carcinoma ( also termed juvenile breast cancer ) , mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of salivary glands ( also termed MASC or MASCSG ) , salivary gland–type carcinoma of the thyroid , secretory carcinoma of the skin , congenital fibrosarcoma , congenital mesoblastic nephroma , rare cases of acute myelogenous leukemia , ALK-negative Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour , cholangiocarcinoma , and radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma .
NTRK3 inhibitors in clinical development
Because cancers associated with the expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein are known or suspected of being a direct consequence of overly active ETV6-NTRK3 's tyrosine kinase , it has been proposed that tyrosine kinase inhibitors with specificity for NTRK3 may be of therapeutic usefulness in these cancers . Entrectinib is a pan-NTRK as well as an ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been found useful in treating a single patient with ETV6-NRTK3 fusion gene-associated mammary analogue secretory carcinoma and has lent support to the clinical development of NTRK3-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors to treat ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein associated malignancies . Three clinical trials are in the recruitment phase for determining the efficacy of treating a wide range of solid tumors associated with mutated overactive tyrosine kinase proteins , including the ETV6-TRK3 protein , with larotrectinib , a non-selective inhibitor of NTRK1 , NTRK2 , and NTRK3 tyrosine kinases . Larotrectinib was approved by the FDA on November 26 , 2018 .

Number 76 Squadron was a squadron of the Royal Air Force . It was formed during World War I as a home defence fighter squadron and in its second incarnation during World War II flew as a bomber squadron , first as an operational training unit and later as an active bomber squadron . With the end of the war the squadron converted to the role of transport squadron , to be reactivated shortly in the bomber role during the 1950s . From 2007 to 2011 , it was a training unit , equipped with the Short Tucano at RAF Linton-on-Ouse .
History
First World War
No . 76 Squadron , RFC was formed at RFC Ripon , Yorkshire for home defence duties on 15 September 1916 in the Yorkshire area , having detachments at Copmanthorpe , Helperby and Catterick . It was equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s and B.E.12s , these being replaced by Bristol F.2Bs in 1918 . The squadron disbanded at Bramham Moor on 13 June 1919 , having seen no action during this part of its service life .
Second World War
Wellesleys , Hampdens and Ansons
The squadron was next reformed at RAF Finningley on 12 April 1937 from ' B ' Flight of No . 7 Squadron , equipped with Vickers Wellesley bombers . These were replaced by Handley Page Hampdens and Avro Ansons in April 1939 , the unit moving to RAF Upper Heyford at the outbreak of war . It performed an operational training role until 8 April 1940 , when it merged with No . 7 Squadron to form No . 16 Operational Training Unit ( OTU ) .
Halifaxes
The squadron reformed shortly on 30 April 1940 at RAF West Raynham as a Hampden unit before being disbanded on 2 May 1940 . On 1 May 1941 , the squadron reformed properly at RAF Linton-on-Ouse as the second Handley Page Halifax bomber squadron , part of the newly created No . 4 Group , RAF Bomber Command . The Squadron moved to RAF Middleton St. George in June 1941 , returning to Linton-on-Ouse in July 1942 . The squadron moving again , this time to RAF Holme-on-Spalding Moor in June 1943 as part of a policy to allow the newly formed Canadian 6 Group to use the better equipped RAF stations that had been built pre-war . The Squadron had a substantial number of Norwegian pilots and aircrew .
From August 1942 to April 1943 , No . 76 Squadron was commanded by Wing Commander Leonard Cheshire .
Dakotas
With the rest of No . 4 Group , No . 76 Squadron was transferred to RAF Transport Command in May 1945 , re-equipping with Douglas Dakotas , shortly thereafter moving to RAF Broadwell . It moved to India in September the same year , where it was disbanded on 1 September 1946 at Palam Airport by being re-numbered to No . 62 Squadron .
Post-war
On 9 December 1953 , the squadron reformed at RAF Wittering , equipped with English Electric Canberra B.2 bombers . The squadron moved in November 1955 to RAF Weston Zoyland , for Operation Grapple . Some of these aircraft were tasked with collecting air samples during the Operation Grapple nuclear trials in 1956/58 . The squadron disbanded on 30 December 1960 at RAF Upwood .
Training
The squadron remained dormant until 1 May 2007 , when the Short Tucano T.1 Air Navigation Squadron at RAF Linton-on-Ouse was redesignated as No . 76 ( Reserve ) Squadron . In 2008 , Prince William spent three months at Linton learning to fly . No . 76 Squadron continued to train WSOs ( Weapons Systems Officers ) until December 2010 , and was disbanded in May 2011 .

The Roquefavour Aqueduct ( ) is an aqueduct in Ventabren , near Aix-en-Provence , Bouches-du-Rhône , France . The aqueduct was first planned in 1565 , but it was not realized until the 19th century . It was designed by Jean François Mayor de Montricher , built between 1841 and 1847 , and is the largest stone aqueduct in the world . It was designated as a `` monument historique '' ( national heritage site ) in 2002 .
Location
The aqueduct is located near Aix-en-Provence . It can be reached via the D64 road . It crosses the Arc river in Ventabren .
History
The idea of the aqueduct was first envisaged by Adam de Craponne , an engineer from Salon de Provence , in 1565 .
After the drought of 1834 and the subsequent cholera epidemics , the idea resurfaced . Maximin-Dominique Consolat ( 1785-1858 ) , who served as the Mayor of Marseille from 1832 to 1843 , championed the idea . They hired engineer Jean François Mayor de Montricher ( 1810–1858 ) to design it . Its construction took six years , from 1841 to 1847 . It took 5,000 labourers , including 300 stone-cutters , and it cost 3,800,000 French francs . It is 83 metres high , 375 metres long , and the foundations are 9 to 10 metres deep .
The aqueduct brings water ( Canal de Marseille ) from the Durance river to the Palais Longchamp in Marseille , all the way to La Ciotat . The water began to flow on 30 June 1847 . On 30 September 1852 , Emperor Louis Napoléon Bonaparte awarded Jean François Mayor de Montricher the Legion of Honour for their work . It was later photographed by renowned photographer Édouard Baldus .
On 12 September 1992 the 150th anniversary of the aqueduct was celebrated . The ceremony was attended by Jean-Claude Gaudin ( Senator and President of the Conseil Régional ) , Lucien Weygand ( the President of the Conseil Général of Bouches-du-Rhone ) , Robert Vigouroux ( Senator and Mayor of Marseille ) , Jean-François Picheral ( Mayor of Aix-en-Provence ) , Bertrand Dauberlieu ( President of the Société des Eaux de Marseille ) , and Jean-Marie Duron ( Mayor of Ventabren ) .
Heritage significance
The aqueduct has been a monument historique ( ) since 2002 .

ModulArt
ModulArt in a new composing methodology theorized and applied to music by Vagnini . The modular composition system extends its procedure to compositions licensed by the musician as completed works of art . To these compositions , new modules can be overlapped . The new modules can be added by the same author in a different moment or by different authors . Greek History University Professor Umberto Bultrighini describes `` Vagnini 's ability to satisfy old needs and combine them with modern technology . ModulArt as the key answer to the need of defining the artist 's work , finding the right balance between art , audience and copyrights '' . Vagnini 's ModulArt is theorized and applied in a theoretical book , in a book + DVD of modular poems and a cd . Writer , painter , and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modularity of Vagnini 's compositions as “ circular like the existence , their works are not finished , but merely stimulus for new voices ” .
Vagnini 's ModulArt in musical composition coincides and was developed independently during the same period of time with Leda Luss Luyken 's ModulArt in the realm of painting .

The Evangelical Alliance ( EA ) is an evangelical Christian organisation based in the UK . Founded in 1846 , the activities of the Evangelical Alliance aim to promote evangelical Christian beliefs in government , media and society . The Evangelical Alliance is based in London , with offices in Cardiff , Glasgow and Belfast . It is a member of the World Evangelical Alliance and also its founding member .
History
The Evangelical Alliance was founded in 1846 by Ridley Haim Herschell , Rev . Edward Steane – a Baptist pastor from Camberwell – John Henderson and Sir Culling Eardley , 3rd Baronet . Eardley became the organisation 's first chairperson , leading the Alliance in its various campaigns for religious freedom ; in 1852 , Eardley campaigned on behalf of the Tuscan prisoners of conscience Francesco Madiai and Rosa Madiai , who had been imprisoned for their Protestant faith .
Overview
The Evangelical Alliance works across 79 different denominations of Christianity , 750 organisations , and has 3,300 member churches .
The Evangelical Alliance 's CEO is Gavin Calver . Peter Lynas is the UK Director , with Fred Drummond acting as Director of Scotland and Siân Rees as Director of Wales . A number of Members of Parliament are associated with the Evangelical Alliance : Conservative MP and former Conservative Party leadership candidate Stephen Crabb is associated with the Alliance through Gweini ( The Council of the Christian Voluntary Sector in Wales ) ; Conservative MP Stuart Anderson is associated with the Alliance through the Freedom Church ; and Conservative MP for Congleton Fiona Bruce is a member of the Evangelical Alliance . Member organisations include Tearfund , an organisation originally established by the Alliance .
Positions
The Evangelical Alliance has historically supported ecumenism – the principle of unity between different church doctrines – with the Roman Catholic Church , an approach criticised by some as in direct contradiction to the beliefs of the Evangelical Alliance 's founders . In 2019 , the Alliance supported the 'Thy Kingdom Come ' initiative – an event organised by the Archbishops of York and Canterbury to bring more people to Christianity through a sustained period of prayer from the dates of the Feast of the Ascension to Pentecost annually .
According to a 2016 Private Eye report , the Evangelical Alliance is openly opposed to homosexuality and same-sex relationships , preaching sexual abstinence for those with same-sex attractions , with membership for openly lesbian and gay people open only to those who `` come to see the need to be transformed '' from their same-sex attraction .
However the Evangelical Alliance 's website distinguishes between same-sex attraction and same-sex sexual relations , rejecting only the latter : `` We encourage evangelical congregations to welcome and accept sexually active lesbians and gay men . However , they should do so in the expectation that they , like all of us who are living outside God 's purposes , will come in due course to see the need to be transformed and live in accordance with biblical revelation and orthodox church teaching . We urge gentleness , patience and ongoing pastoral care during this process and after a person renounces same-sex sexual relations . ''

The Half-Hearted is a 1900 novel of romance and adventure by the Scottish author John Buchan . It was Buchan 's first novel in a modern setting and was written when they were 24 while working for an All-Souls fellowship and reading for the bar .
Plot introduction
The Half-Hearted is a novel in two parts : part I is a story of manners and romance in upper class Scotland , while part II is an action tale of adventure and duty in northern India . The novel is set in the closing years of the 19th century and explores the way in which the social expectations of the main characters shape the paths they must tread . It follows the life of Lewis Haystoun , a young Scottish laird , who finds themselves unable to commit wholeheartedly to any course of action . Their failure to seize the opportunity results in the woman they love agreeing to marry a rival . Determined to face up to what they consider to be their cowardice , Haystoun departs for the Empire 's north west frontier where they die attempting to hold a narrow mountain pass single-handedly against an invading Cossack army .
Plot
When their local Member of Parliament decides to retire , Lewis Haystoun is persuaded to stand . Although they are liked and respected by their local tenants , they find themselves unable to speak wholeheartedly and with full conviction at the hustings and is beaten by their opponent , the ambitious and fluent social climber Albert Stocks . Following an initial meeting at a dinner party , both Haystoun and Stocks fall in love with Alice Wishart , the daughter of a rich city merchant . Miss Wishart initially favours Haystoun , but gradually becomes disenchanted with their apparent lack of ability to commit to anything . During a picnic on the moors , Miss Wishart slips and falls into a lake . Haystoun , standing beside her , hesitates just long enough to allow their rival to dive in and make the rescue . Haystoun is devastated , believes themselves to be a coward and avoids Miss Wishart 's company , pushing them more and more into the company of Stocks . Stock asks them to marry them and , believing that Haystoun is not interested in her , they agree .
Rumours have reached the British Government of a possible danger to the Empire via an uncharted area of the northern Indian frontier . Haystoun has explored this area before , and when they are asked by a friend to go out again to reconnoitre in a semi-official capacity , they jump at the chance to escape their situation and to prove their courage . The night before their departure , Haystoun and Miss Wishart meet and declare their mutual love for the first time . Although there would still be time for Miss Wishart to break off their engagement , the pair feel that they have been 'set apart by the fates ' and they separate to follow their own individual paths .
In part II of the novel , Haystoun travels to the northern frontier lands where they learn of a Russian plot to invade India via a little-known narrow mountain pass in the Kashmir , with the help of the local hill tribes . Having become aware of an imminent Cossack attack , Haystoun sends word to the local fort , calling on them to telegraph warnings to the northern garrisons and settlements , and sets off alone to try to delay the invaders at the pass . There they die heroically , but is able to delay the invasion for just time enough for the alarm to be raised and for defences to be put in place . The Empire is saved by their valiant efforts .
Critical reception
In Clubland Heroes ( 1953 , revised 1974 ) , Richard Usborne suggested that this novel is in some ways more revealing of the Buchan 'decent-fellow ' ethic than any other till the last , Sick Heart River , with Haystoun 's death to some extent foreshadowing that of Edward Leithen in the later work . Buchan was only 25 when they completed The Half-Hearted , and had not at that stage quite found their wavelength . But in Haystoun there is much of their later characters Sandy Arbuthnot and Richard Hannay .
David Daniell , writing in 1975 , considered the novel to be flawed but interesting . They felt the book weakest in its depiction of London clubs and upper class manners and conversation , but noted other areas that show `` flashes of the true Buchan gift '' . Buchan worked through several of the themes that did not quite succeed in this novel , and returned to them with more assurance in later years , particularly in Mr Standfast ( 1919 ) , Huntingtower ( 1922 ) and John Macnab ( 1925 ) .
Writing for the John Buchan Society website in 2001 , Christine Drews noted that this novel is the one most influenced by John Buchan 's study of Greek tragedy . They held that the work 's conclusion illumines a path of understanding that can provide perspective on small real-life disappointments and missed satisfactions . The telescoping of the immensity of a single gifted man 's death into a purposeful cog in the turning of the wheel of eternity is a foreign , yet broadening philosophy , which shakes the reader 's complacency . They concluded that the book is a difficult one to enjoy , but a compelling one to contemplate .
Andrew Lownie , in their 2013 biography The Presbyterian Cavalier , called the novel ' a very uneven book ' that reflects Buchan 's attempt to reconcile the differing attitudes to life of their Oxford circle : with the 'careless and gay ' Lewis Haystoun contrasting with 'the world 's iron and salt ' represented by the author himself .

Hengshan Road ( ) , formerly Avenue Pétain , is a street in the former French Concession of Shanghai , China . A major thoroughfare that connected the heart of the French Concession with the Catholic district of Zikawei ( Xujiahui ) , the boulevard was for much of the 20th century the centre of Shanghai 's premier residential district . Since the 1990s , many of the mansions along the road have been converted into bars , night clubs , and restaurants . From 2016 onward , many of the bars on Hengshan Road have been closed down or moved away to other new and more popular entertainment districts in the city .
History
Named after Philippe Pétain , Marshal of France , the boulevarde was constructed in 1922 to link the heart of the French Concession with Zikawei , now Xujiahui , the centre of Catholicism in Shanghai . It stretched from Rue Pottier and Rue Henri-Rivière in the east , to the intersection of Avenue Haig and Rue de Zikawei in the west .
The newly developed boulevard soon attracted an American presence , as American expatriates who worked in the Shanghai International Settlement built more spacious residences in the newly developed area . This American presence can still be seen in the form of the former American College ( No . 10 ) , and the Community Church ( No . 53 ) . A large number of mansions were built along the road in the 1920s , with some high-end apartment blocks built in the 1930s as land value soared in the area . The Chinese headquarters of Pathé Records was also located on Avenue Petain .
The French Concession was handed over by Vichy France to the Wang Jingwei government in 1943 , which renamed the boulevard as `` Hengshan Road '' , after Mount Heng , a sacred mountain in Hunan province .
In the 1990s , many of the former mansions were converted into bars , night clubs and restaurants , making the street an important centre of night entertainment in Shanghai . Many of the restaurants and bars are located in side streets off Hengshan Road , particularly , Dongping Road and Taojiang Road .
The Community Church , also known as the International church or Union Church was built in 1925 ( at the corner of Wulumuqi ( Ürümqi ) Road ) is open to foreigners and has services on Sundays .
Just off Hengshan Road near the Hengshan Road Metro station , on Gao'an Road , are some of the few remaining manhole entrances mark `` CMF '' ( Conseil Municipal Français ) . The manhole covers have been replaced , but the metal structures around the outside are original .
Present day
There are numerous bars , nightclubs and a bowling alley located towards the center of the street . Next to the subway station is Yong Ping Li , an ANKEN urban regeneration project consisting of a 6,000 sqm compound stretching from Heng Shan Rd through to Yonjia Rd
Transportation
The central part of Hengshan Road can be reached by taking Shanghai Metro Line 1 to Hengshan Road station . It is also a short ride by taxi from central Shanghai .

Adam Dorrel ( born December 2 , 1974 ) is an American football coach and former player . They are the current head coach of the Central Oklahoma Bronchos football team in Edmond , Oklahoma , a position they will begin in 2022 . Previously Dorrel was the head coach at Northwest Missouri State in Maryville , Missouri from 2011 to 2016 , and Abilene Christian in Abilene , Texas , from 2017 to 2021 . While at Northwest Missouri State they led the program to three undefeated seasons and the NCAA Division II Football Championship in 2013 , 2015 , and 2016 .
Early life , family , and playing career
Dorrel is to date the only Maryville native to coach Northwest Missouri State . They graduated from Maryville High School , where they were a two-time All-Midland Empire Conference and all-district lineman . In 1992 Dorrel was named as an all-state offensive lineman . Dorrel 's great-grandfather was a fullback on Northwest 's first team in 1908 , and their grandfather and two great-uncles played for the team in the 1940s .
Dorrel played under Northwest 's Mel Tjeerdsma during Tjeerdsma 's first Northwest season in 1994 in which the Bearcats went 0–11 before Tjeerdsma began their run of seven NCAA Division II Football Championship games . They were captain of the team under Tjeerdsma in 1995 , 1996 and 1997 . They were Daktronics Second-Team All-America offensive lineman as a senior in 1997 ( with Bearcats reaching the quarterfinals in both 1996 and 1997 ) .
Coaching career
After graduating from Northwest in 1998 they were a graduate assistant in 1998 at Northeastern State University in Oklahoma . They returned to Northwest as a graduate assistant in 1999 when Bearcats won their second national championship in 1999 . They received their master 's degree from Northwest in 2000 . They held a position as offensive line coach at Dakota State University in 2000 and offensive coach at William Jewell College from 2001 to 2003 .
In 2004 , they returned to Northwest and held offensive positions as the team made five consecutive national championship appearances in 2005-2009 including a national championship in 2009 ( a year in which the Bearcats averaged 42 points and 474 yards per game ) .
In 2007 , they were named offensive coach of the United States national American football team for the 2007 IFAF World Cup ( which the United States won ) .
Before the 2011 season , Tjeerdsma retired and Scott Bostwick who had been the defensive coach at Northwest was named to succeed Tjeerdsma . Dorrel was promoted to assistant coach and had planned to continue their offensive duties . Bostwick died of a heart attack on June 5 , 2011 . On June 23 Dorrel was named head coach . Both Bostwick and Dorrel had started affiliations with Northwest under Tjeerdsma in the first 0–11 1994 season and both coaches did not have prior head coaching positions before taking over the head coach position . The Maryville Daily Forum in applauding the appointment noted that Northwest had wanted to hire somebody familiar with the Tjeerdsma tradition rather than going outside .
After winning the 2016 Division II Championship , Dorrel announced they will be leaving the Bearcats to become head coach at Abilene Christian University .
Following a 5-6 campaign in the 2021 season , Abilene Christian relieved Dorrel of their coaching duties . Dorrel ended with an overall record of 19-32 at Abilene Christian .
On December 5 , 2021 Dorrel became the head coach of the Central Oklahoma Bronchos football program .

Ernest `` Ernie '' McGarr ( born 9 March 1944 ) is a Scottish former professional footballer , who played as a goalkeeper for several clubs in the Scottish Football League and was capped twice for the Scotland national side .
Playing career
McGarr signed for Aberdeen in 1965 from Junior club Kilbirnie Ladeside , and made their first team debut at the end of the 1965–66 season in a friendly match versus Crystal Palace . The presence of Bobby Clark as their rival for the goalkeeping position at Pittodrie meant that first team opportunities in the early years were limited . It was only during the 1968–69 season , when a loss of form by Clark prompted manager Eddie Turnbull to give them a chance , that McGarr was able to stake their claim and secure a regular starting position .
Such was the impact that McGarr made , Scottish internationalist Clark could not regain their position , even appearing as an outfield player on two occasions . McGarr 's form was itself recognised with an international call-up for a friendly game in September 1969 against the Republic of Ireland . Unfortunately , they went into the game carrying an injury picked up from a club match the previous day and only lasted 35 minutes before being substituted for Jim Herriot . They made one further appearance for the national team in November the same year , versus Austria in a FIFA World Cup qualifying match however Scotland were already unable to qualify and lost 2–0 .
McGarr again lost their place in the Aberdeen side to Bobby Clark in early 1970 and later that year tabled a transfer request , eventually moving to Dunfermline Athletic in January 1971 . From Dunfermline , McGarr moved to East Fife where they spent five seasons . A highlight of their spell at Bayview was a game against title chasing Celtic in February 1973 where they saved three penalty kicks in an entertaining 2–2 draw . They later played for Cowdenbeath , Airdrieonians and Berwick Rangers before finishing their career in Fife Junior football .

The 1959 Giro d'Italia was the 42nd running of the Giro d'Italia , one of cycling 's Grand Tour races . The Giro started in Milan , on 16 May , with a stage and concluded back in Milan , on 7 June , with a leg . A total of 120 riders from 15 teams entered the 20-stage race , which was won by Luxembourgian Charly Gaul of the team . The second and third places were taken by Frenchman Jacques Anquetil and Italian Diego Ronchini , respectively .
Teams
In the weeks preceding the Giro 's start , Jacques Anquetil and the team were interested in participating in the race ; however , they desired an appearance fee . After calls were made , the team eventually settled on coming to the race . Ultimately , thirteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1959 edition of the Giro d'Italia . Each team sent a squad of ten riders , which meant that the race started with a peloton of 130 cyclists . The teams were primarily composed of Italian riders except and . From the riders that began the race , 86 made it to the finish in Milan .
The teams entering the race were :
Pre-race favorites
Jacques Anquetil and Charly Gaul were seen as favorites to win the race . Anquetil entered the Giro with a formidable Helyett–Leroux–Fynsec–Hutchinson team that included the likes of 1958 Vuelta a España winner Jean Stablinski , the 1958 Tour de France 's most `` elegant '' rider Edouard Delberghe , Irishman Seamus Elliot , and Jean Graczyk . When asked about their chances to win the race Anquetil stated : `` I know that I am in good shape . If I am beaten , it will mean there are better riders than myself in the race . '' Reigning world champion Ercole Baldini was seen as a contender to win the race , but due to an operation at the beginning of the cycling season they entered the race weighing more than normal . Charly Gaul entered as a previous winner of the Giro d'Italia in 1956 Giro d'Italia , as well as the reigning champion of the Tour de France .
Faema–Guerra 's Rik Van Looy had desires to win a Grand Tour during their career and had previously raced the Giro in 1955 and Vuelta a España in 1958 , not finishing either race . However , during the 1959 campaign , Looy won the Giro di Sardegna and Vuelta a Levante , as well as finishing third in the Vuelta a España . Faema–Guerra entered with a completely Belgian team except for German Hans Junkerman and had gotten the nickname `` Red Guard '' because of their red jerseys , the team was well known for setting up Looy for stage victories . Miguel Poblet stated they were not there just to win stages .
Route and stages
The route for the race was released on 2 April 1959 at the Casino della Valle in Saint Vincent in front of journalists , local dignitaries , and various industrialists . There were four individual time trials within the race of which one , stage 7 , was a climbing time trial up to Mount Vesuvius . Ten stages contained a total 15 categorized climbs . The only rest day was scheduled on 27 May in Rimini . The race consisted of 22 days of racing and was covered .
Regarding the route for the Giro d'Italia , Corriere dello Sport writer Cesare Facetti felt that the route was very difficult and would make it very difficult for a rider to complete the Giro d'Italia and be successful in the Tour de France in late June .
Race overview
The race began with the introductions in the Duomo square in front of the Milan cathedral , with Baldini received the loudest ovation upon their introduction . The opening leg finished at the famed Spa town Salsomaggiore . During the stage , only one breakaway was able to sustain a lengthy advantage over the peloton and that came into the race with a solo attack by Darrigade ( Helyett ) . They managed to win the intermediate sprint on the course before being joined by six riders and another twenty as the stage wound down ; however , the escapees were caught with to go . The day ended with a bunch sprint won by Belgian Rik Van Looy . The following stage was the first individual time trial of the race , which Anquetil was favored to win . Anquetil won the day by twenty-five seconds ahead of Rolf Graf and assumed the race lead . They rode the stage on a 52 x 13 gear , which when Gaul found out following the stage said `` Nobody , not even Anquetil , can push that gear . '' The first summit finish came with the third leg that ended on the Abetone . A twelve-man group containing Looy and Jos Hoevenaers reached the climb first , while a second major group containing the favorites likes Anquetil and Gaul reached the climb after . Gaul attacked at the beginning of the climb and reached the first group alone . They rode with them for a short time before attacking and going on solo to win the stage and take the race lead .
Around into the fourth stage , near Pistoie , a group of nine broke away from the peloton and established a lead of five minutes that soon grew to eleven as the stage progressed . The peloton reacted and began to increase their tempo , but they did not catch the breakaway . In the breakaway , some riders cracked leaving Arturo Neri , Armando Pellegrini , Aurelio Cestari , and Gastone Nencini at the front . Pellegrini edged out Cestari and Nencini to take the stage , while Neri dropped before the finish line and finished four seconds behind .
During the sixth leg into Naples , Seamus Elliot ( Helyett–Pontin ) attacked from the leading breakaway as the stage came to a close , primarily because of sprinter Miguel Poblet 's ( Ignis ) presence in the breakaway . They went under one kilometer left before they cramped with remaining and was overtaken . Poblet won the stage , while Elliot held on to get 10th place . The next day 's stage was a climbing individual time trial along a road on Mount Vesuvius , which ended at the observatory on the volcano . As the riders began the time trial in reverse of the standings for the general classification , contenders Anquetil and Gaul were the final two to get on the course . Anquetil again chose a larger gear ( 45 x 20 ) , while Gaul chose a smaller gear ( 45 x 23 ) . Anquetil was faster over the initial stretch of the race which covered the cobblestones , but after that stretch , Gaul closed the gap . Gaul finished eight seconds after Anquetil did , winning the stage by 37 seconds over Guido Boni ( Tricofilina ) . A time trial followed the next day , but this time it was around the island of Ischia . The course was rather hilly and was won by Antonino Catalano ( Bianchi ) , while with respect to the general classification , Anquetil managed to gain 22 seconds on Gaul .
San Marino was the destination of the twelfth leg and it could be reached by one road when entering from Romini , a steep and rough road . The course featured two and a half circuits before its conclusion uphill . Anquetil attacked on the flat roads before the final climb and Nino Defilippis won the stage . Anquetil , who placed third , gained time they gained on the general classification contenders , put them 34 seconds behind the leader Gaul .
After the leading riders had crossed the Costalunga during the fifteenth day , Gaul descended with an advantage on a group containing Poblet , Anquetil , and Van Looy . The riders caught and passed Gaul when they suffered a puncture on the descent . The trio opened a large gap and Poblet won the stage , while Gaul crossed 2 minutes and 33 seconds behind . This loss gave Anquetil the race lead .
In the time trial to Susa , Anquetil caught Gaul into the stage . Gaul proceeded to ride in Anquetil 's slipstream for the remainder of the stage before Anquetil dropped them in the final kilometer .
Classification leadership
One jersey was worn during the 1959 Giro d'Italia . The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey . This classification is the most important of the race , and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro .
The mountains classification leader . The climbs were ranked in first and second categories . In this ranking , points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists . There were two categories of mountains . The first category awarded 80 , 60 , 40 , 30 , and 20 points , while the second distributed 60 , 40 , and 20 points . Although no jersey was awarded , there was also one classification for the teams , in which the teams were awarded points for their rider 's performance during the stages .

The national flag of Malaysia , also known as the Stripes of Glory ( ) , is composed of a field of 14 alternating red and white stripes along the fly and a blue canton bearing a crescent and a 14-point star known as the Bintang Persekutuan ( Federal Star ) . The 14 stripes , of equal width , represent the equal status in the federation of the 13 member states and the federal territories , while the 14 points of the star represent the unity between these entities . The crescent represents Islam , the country 's state religion ; the blue canton symbolises the unity of the Malaysian people ; the yellow of the star and crescent is the royal colour of the Malay rulers .
Construction sheet
History
Selection
The current Malaysian flag is based on the flag of the Federation of Malaya . In 1949 , a year after the Federation was created , the Federal Legislative Council called for a contest to design a new national flag . The competition attracted 373 entries , three of which were put forward to the public in a poll held by The Malay Mail .
The first flag had a ring of 11 white stars on a blue background , with two red Malay kris ( daggers ) in the middle . The second was the same as the first but with two concentric rings of 5 and 6 stars . The third had 11 blue and white stripes , and a red field in the top-left corner with a white crescent and five-pointed star on it . This last design was chosen as the winner .
In December 1949 , the Federal Legislative Council decided to make changes to the winning design . At the suggestion of statesman Onn Jaafar , the red and blue colours were swapped , the crescent and star were changed from white to yellow , and six more points were added to the star . The final version of the Malayan flag was approved by George VI on 19 May 1950 and was first raised in front of the Sultan of Selangor 's residence on 26 May 1950 . On 31 August 1957 , it was raised upon independence at Merdeka Square in place of the British Union Flag .
Symbolism
As the flag was finalised for official use , the significance of the design were given as follows :
Red , white and blue – represents Malaysia as a country belonging in the Commonwealth .
Crescent and star – represents Islam as the official religion for the Federation , as yellow symbolises sovereignty of the Malay Rulers and their roles as leader of the faith in the constituent states . The eleven-pointed star itself symbolises the `` unity and co-operation '' of said member states .
Red and white had also been the traditional colours of the region since the time of the Majapahit Empire .
The designer
The Malayan flag was designed by Mohamed Hamzah , a 29-year-old architect working for the Public Works Department ( JKR ) in Johor Baharu , Johor . They entered the national flag design competition with two designs that they had completed in two weeks . The first was a green flag with blue kris in the middle , surrounded by 15 white stars . The second , which became one of the three finalists , was said to be inspired by the flag of Johor , but with five white stripes added to the blue field .
Mohamed Hamzah died just short of their 75th birthday on 13 February 1993 in Jalan Stulang Baru , Kampung Melayu Majidee , Johor .
Modifications
Following the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 , the design of the Malayan flag was modified to reflect and honour the new states in the federation .
Three additional stripes were added to the existing flag and the star was given 14 points to reflect the federation of the original 11 states in Malaya plus Sabah , Sarawak , and Singapore ; the design remained the same even after Singapore 's expulsion from the federation two years later . When Kuala Lumpur was designated a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974 , the additional stripe and the point in the star were appropriated to represent this new addition to the federation . Eventually , with the addition of two other federal territories , Labuan in 1984 and Putrajaya in 2001 , the fourteenth stripe and point in the star came to be associated with the federal government in general .
In 1997 , when Malaysians were invited to name the flag , then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad picked the name Jalur Gemilang to project the country 's onward drive towards continuous growth and success .
Mark of respect
During the National Day celebrations , everyone is encouraged to fly the Jalur Gemilang at their homes , office buildings , shops and corporate premises .
If the flag is fixed at home , it is to be raised pointing towards the road .
If the flag is put in a group of flags with state and private company flags , the Malaysian flag must be raised in between two flags and its pole placed higher than the rest .
Historical flags
Flag anthem
The flag anthem is written as dedication and pride of the Malaysian national flag . It is performed on Hari Merdeka , the nation 's independence day on 31 August every year . The original anthem Benderaku was written by Malaysian songwriter Tony Fonseka . After the flag was given the name Jalur Gemilang , the flag anthem was updated in 1997 to reflect this change . This was then followed by an introduction of a new flag anthem , with arrangements by Malaysian songwriter Pak Ngah and lyrics by Malaysian songwriter Siso Kopratasa .
Other ensigns and flags
Government vessels use the Jalur Gemilang as the state ensign . The following is a table of the other ensigns used in Malaysia with the national flag inside .
Federal Star ( Bintang Persekutuan )
The Federal Star is similar in concept of Australia 's Commonwealth Star in that it symbolises the unity of states in the Malaysian federation and its Federal government , featuring 14 points to represent the federation 's 13 states and the federal territories . It is also used on the Royal Malaysian Air Force roundel , the Malaysian Chinese Association ( MCA ) and the former United Malayan Banking Corporation ( UMBC ) logo .
The Patani Malayu National Revolutionary Front , a Southern Thai Malay separatist group involved in the South Thailand insurgency , originally adopted an independence flag that incorporated a crescent and 15-point variation of the Federal Star on its flag to represent the southernmost Thai provinces ' closer tie to Malay and Muslim-majority Malaysia over that of Thailand .

In economics and game theory , global games are games of incomplete information where players receive possibly-correlated signals of the underlying state of the world . Global games were originally defined by Carlsson and van Damme ( 1993 ) .
The most important practical application of global games has been the study of crises in financial markets such as bank runs , currency crises , and bubbles . However , they have other relevant applications such as investments with payoff complementarities , beauty contests , political riots and revolutions , and any other economic situation which displays strategic complementarity .
Global games in models of currency crises
Stephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin ( 1998 ) considered a stylized currency crises model , in which traders observe the relevant fundamentals with small noise , and show that this leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium . This result overturns the result in models of complete information , which feature multiple equilibria .
One concern with the robustness of this result is that the introduction of a theory of prices in global coordination games may reintroduce multiplicity of equilibria . This concern was addressed in Angeletos and Werning ( 2006 ) as well as Hellwig and coauthors ( 2006 ) . They show that equilibrium multiplicity may be restored by the existence of prices acting as an endogenous public signal , provided that private information is sufficiently precise .

Declan Masterson is an Irish uilleann piper , traditional musician , composer and arranger . In addition to pursuing a solo career and playing with Moving Hearts and Patrick Street , Masterson was one of the Riverdance musicians .
They have performed and recorded with many artists , including : Van Morrison , Dónal Lunny , Andy Irvine , Bill Whelan , Clannad , Jim McCann , Eleanor McEvoy , Townes Van Zandt , Michael Londra , Zoë Conway , Ronnie Drew ( with Bono ) , John Denver and Christy Moore , among others .
Early years
Born in Cabra , Dublin , Masterson grew up in a musical family , and learned to play the pipes and other instruments at an early age . They were encouraged by their parents Frances and Jim , who both played traditional music , and by their uncle Jimmy O'Reilly , a squeezebox player from Multyfarnham , County Westmeath . They took a keen interest in the uilleann pipes and was mentored by pipe maker Matt Kiernan , who lived nearby and made their first set . Masterson first played with the Pipers Club Céilí Band , and their first group was Tipsy Sailor , which included Gerry O'Connor ( banjo ) and Fiách Ó Broin ( flute ) . Masterson gained a Leaving Certificate from O'Connell School , Dublin , in 1974 .
Music career
Moving Hearts
The group Moving Hearts was formed in 1981 when two members of Planxty , Dónal Lunny ( bouzouki ) and Christy Moore ( vocals , guitar and bodhrán ) , decided to explore the possibilities of linking contemporary music to Irish traditional music . They initially intended to form a trio with guitarist Declan Sinnott , but then expanded the group to include Irish musicians Keith Donald ( alto sax ) , Eoghan O'Neill ( bass ) , Brian Calnan ( drums ) , and Davy Spillane ( uilleann pipes ) .
After several changes of personnel and the recording of three albums , Moving Hearts ( 1981 ) , The Dark End Of The Street ( 1982 ) and Live Hearts ( 1983 ) , Moving Hearts performed as an instrumental group , recording the album The Storm ( 1985 ) with a new line-up consisting of : Spillane and Masterson ( uilleann pipes ) , Lunny ( bouzouki , synthesiser & bodhrán ) , Donald ( sax ) , Noel Eccles ( percussion ) , Matt Kelleghan ( drums ) , O'Neill ( bass ) and Greg Boland ( guitar ) . The group ceased touring in 1984 , appearing only at occasional festivals like the Preseli Folk Festival—now the Fishguard Folk Festival—in 1986 . They performed for a sold out , farewell concert at Dublin 's Point Theatre in 1990 , with Flo McSweeney on vocals .
Mosaic
In the winter of 1984 , Andy Irvine gathered a collection of musicians from throughout Europe and formed Mosaic , with a final line-up including Irvine himself , Lunny , Masterson , Danish Lissa Ladefoged ( bass and vocals ) , Dutch Hans Theessink ( guitar and vocals ) , and Hungarian singer Márta Sebestyén from Muzsikás .
They performed in Budapest on 12 July 1985 , followed by a further two gigs in Hungary and an appearance at the Dranouter festival in Belgium in early August , prior to their English tour . Their seventh gig was billed at the Southport Arts Center , which Chris Hardwick of Folk Roots reviewed with the words : `` Every once in a while folk scene throws up a new permutation in which exceptionally gifted individuals come together to produce something so innovative and exhilarating that it goes way beyond the sum of the parts '' . However , the band lasted only that one summer .
Patrick Street
Masterson , along with Bill Whelan , joined Patrick Street in time to record the album Irish Times ( 1990 ) .
Riverdance
In 1994 , Masterson teamed up with Whelan again and joined Riverdance . They remained with the show on and off for its entire duration , playing uilleann pipes , low whistle , tin whistle , kaval and bouzouki , also taking on the duties of musical director , until the Farewell show in May 2012 . They returned for the 25th Anniversary series of concerts , beginning at the 3Arena ( Dublin ) in February 2020 , playing guitar , bouzouki , kaval and pipes . The shows planned for the 2020 US and UK tours were cancelled , with the US dates rescheduled to take place from January to July 2021 .
Solo and other projects
They recorded five solo albums : End of the Harvest ( 1990 ) , Tropical Trad ( 1993 ) , Fairwater Fionnuisce ( 1996 ) , Drifting Through The Hazel Woods ( 1996 ) and Heartland ( 2005 ) . They wrote and arranged music scores for film , TV and theatre , and their piping is featured on the soundtrack of the films The Irish RM ( 1983-1985 ) , Eat the Peach ( 1986 ) , The Secret of Roan Inish ( 1994 ) and Some Mother 's Son ( 1996 ) . They also participated in many recordings , with a wide range of musicians ( see Selected discography ) .

Print Wikipedia is an art project by Michael Mandiberg that included a printed edition of 106 volumes of the English Wikipedia as it existed on April 7 , 2015 . The bound paper volumes , each running 700 pages , represented a fraction of the 7,473 total volumes necessary to render the encyclopedia 's extant text on that date . As first shown at the Denny Gallery in New York City during summer 2015 , the project included a display of the spines of the first 1,980 volumes in the set . The 106 printed volumes included only text of the encyclopedia articles : images and references were omitted . Supplementing the printed volumes of encyclopedia articles , additional print volumes included the appendix to all 7.5 million contributors to English Wikipedia ( in 36 volumes ) and a table of contents ( in 91 volumes ) .
Influence
Similar art projects have printed part of the German Wikipedia ( Berlin , 2016 ) and the Dutch Wikipedia ( Ghent , 2016 ) .
Background
Mandiberg originally conceived the project in 2009 but ran into technical difficulties . They then engaged an assistant , Jonathan Kirinathan , to aid with the programming of the code to compile , format and upload the entire contents of English Wikipedia . The print files were uploaded to book self-publisher Lulu.com and made available for printout as paper volumes .
Mandiberg 's motivation was to answer the question , `` How big is it ? '' For a big data entity , its size is on the threshold of what can be perceived as a collection of volumes , but not so large as to overwhelm one 's senses , such as the data files of Facebook or the NSA . Katherine Maher , the Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation , described it as `` a gesture at knowledge '' . Wikimedia cooperated with the project and Lulu.com helped fund it .
The task took three years , and the upload process took 24 days , 3 hours and 18 minutes . It was completed on 12 July 2015 . PediaPress had attempted to raise money for a full English Wikipedia printout on Indiegogo in 2014 , with a goal of $ 50,000 ( £30,000 ) , but the project was pulled . The abandoned project had intended to print 1,000 volumes , of 1,200 pages each : a total of 1,200,000 pages , roughly equal to 80 meters of shelf space . Mandiberg later assured people that they would not be printing out the entire collection , claiming that an entire collection is not necessary for people to comprehend the true size of Wikipedia , and , once people have seen a portion of it , it will help them realize its size . Mandiberg estimates that the printing costs of a full printout would be around $ 500,000 . The Denny art exhibit featured only a selection of actual printed volumes with about 2,000 of the other volumes represented as spines on the wall . The show revolved around the actual upload of the print files to Lulu.com .

Lillingstone Dayrell is a village in Buckinghamshire , England . It is in Aylesbury Vale , about three and a half miles north of Buckingham , eight miles west of Milton Keynes and five miles south of Towcester . Lillingstone Dayrell with Luffield Abbey and the neighbouring hamlet of Lillingstone Lovell are separate civil parishes within Aylesbury Vale district .
The village name 'Lillingstone ' is Anglo Saxon in origin , and means 'Lytel 's boundary stone ' , referring to the proximity of both places to the border with Northamptonshire . In the Domesday Book of 1086 both settlements were recorded jointly as Lillingestan though already at that time there were two manors owned respectively by the Dayrell and Lovell families . The suffix 'Dayrell ' ( as 'Dayerell ' ) was first recorded in the fourteenth century . The Dayrell family were Lords of the Manor from the fourteenth century until the 1880s .
Notable buildings
The parish church of Lillingstone Dayrell is dedicated to St Nicholas of Myra .
Lillingstone House is the ancient seat of the Dayrell family .
In 1882 , the banker Abraham John Robarts , of Robarts , Lubbock & Co. , then the tenant of Lillingstone House , built Tile House in the village for himself , designed by Ewan Christian . This is described by Nikolaus Pevsner as “ Neo-Elizabethan , big and forbidding with groups of huge chimneys . ”
Notable people
Gerald Robarts ( 1878–1961 ) , banker , soldier , and notable squash player , lived at Lillingstone Dayrell House .

Emperor Ming of Jin ( ; 299 – 18 October 325 , personal name Sima Shao ( 司馬紹 ) , courtesy name Daoji ( 道畿 ) , was an emperor of the Eastern Jin dynasty of China . During their brief reign ( 323–325 ) , they led the weakened Jin out of domination by the warlord Wang Dun , but at their early death , the empire was left to their young son Emperor Cheng , and the fragile balance of power that they created was soon broken , leading to the Su Jun Disturbance and weakening the Jin state even further .
Early life
Sima Shao was born in 299 , as the oldest son of their father Sima Rui , then the Prince of Langya , by their lowly-born concubine Lady Xun , who then in 300 gave birth to another son , Sima Pou ( 司馬裒 ) . Sima Rui 's wife , Princess Yu Mengmu ( 虞孟母 ) , who was themselves childless , became very jealous of Lady Xun and mistreated them greatly . Lady Xun , not able to bear the abuse , complained bitterly , and was thrown out of the household . Sima Shao was therefore raised by Princess Yu , with whom they apparently had a cordial relationship . During their youth , they were considered intelligent and quick-thinking , although eventually their brother Sima Pou became more favored by their father .
While Sima Rui served as Left Prime Minister under Emperor Min , the teenage Sima Shao was put in charge of defending Guangling . After Sima Rui declared themselves the Prince of Jin following Emperor Min 's capture by Han Zhao in 316 , they initially wanted to make Sima Pou their crown prince , but after Wang Dao pointed out that traditionally the older son should succeed him , they created Sima Shao crown prince . Sima Shao remained in that status after their father declared themselves emperor ( as Emperor Yuan ) in 318 , after Han Zhao executed Emperor Min .
As crown prince
While crown prince , Sima Shao was known for seeking out talented men and befriending them , treating them as friends and not as subordinates . These included Wang Dao , Yu Liang ( whose sister Yu Wenjun they married ) , Wen Jiao , Huan Yi ( 桓彝 ) , and Ruan Fang ( 阮放 ) . They were also known for their filial piety and their literary studies . They later also added martial arts to their studies , and they often visited troops to encourage them .
When Wang Dun rebelled against Emperor Yuan in 322 , the capital Jiankang fell easily to Wang . Upon hearing news that Wang had breached Jiankang 's defenses , Crown Prince Shao was going to themselves make a last stand , but Wen stopped them by cutting off the ropes off their horse . When Wang subsequently forced Emperor Yuan into submission , they considered deposing Crown Prince Shao by falsely accusing Crown Prince Shao of being disobedient to Emperor Yuan . However , Wen prevented this by publicly praising Crown Prince Shao of filial piety , making Wang 's putative accusations not credible .
Early in 323 , Emperor Yuan died in distress after their defeat by Wang . Crown Prince Shao succeeded to the throne as Emperor Ming .
Reign
One of the first things that Emperor Ming did was locating their birth mother Lady Xun , putting them in a mansion , and creating them the Lady of Jian'an . However , perhaps out of respect for their deceased stepmother Princess Yu ( who had died in 312 but was posthumously honored as an empress ) , they never gave them an empress dowager title—and Emperor Ming honored Princess Yu 's family as appropriately they would a mother 's family—and they were particularly close to Princess Yu 's brother Yu Yin ( 虞胤 ) . A few months after they took the throne , Lady Xun moved into the palace . Emperor Ming also created their wife , Crown Princess Yu , empress .
Wang Dun did not think much of the new emperor , and they plotted usurping the throne . In summer 323 , they had Emperor Ming summon them to the capital , but actually did not go to the capital , but only moved their headquarters from Wuchang ( 武昌 , in modern Ezhou , Hubei ) to Gushu ( 姑孰 , in modern Ma'anshan , Anhui ) , closer to the capital , and also taking over the governorship of the capital province . When Emperor Ming tried to commission the official Chi Jian as the military commander at Hefei , positionally behind Wang , Wang resisted , and Emperor Ming was forced to recall Chi .
In 324 , Wang Dun grew ill , and became resolved to overthrow Jin so that their adopted son , Wang Ying ( 王應 ) , could be emperor . ( This was after their initial two inclinations—ordering that their troops be disbanded after their death , or having Wang Ying continue to control their troops but pledging allegiance to Emperor Ming—were rejected by their strategists . ) They also made Wen Jiao , by that point a trusted assistant , the mayor of Jiankang , to keep an eye on the emperor—forgetting that Wen was loyal to Emperor Ming , and upon arrival in Jiankang , Wen informed Emperor Ming of Wang 's plans , as well as their illness . Wang Dao , also loyal to Emperor Ming , then falsely declared to the imperial forces that Wang Dun had died , further increasing their morale , and Emperor Ming reinforced their troops by summoning battle-tested soldiers from the northern borders with Later Zhao back to the capital . ( When the generals in command of these forces , Su Jun and Liu Xia ( 劉遐 ) arrived at Jiankang , even though it was dark in the night , Emperor Ming went to personally visit the troops , greatly enhancing their morale . ) Wang Dun then sent their forces east to Jiankang , headed by their brother Wang Han ( 王含 , Wang Ying 's biological father ) and Qian Feng ( 錢鳳 ) , but could not decisively defeat the imperial troops . The imperial troops then attacked by , defeating Wang Han . Wang Dun , upon hearing initial news of defeat , died . The imperial forces then defeated Wang Han 's troops more completely , forcing Wang Han and Wang Ying to flee , but they were captured by Wang Dun 's brother Wang Shu ( 王舒 ) , who executed them by drowning to show theirs loyalty .
In 325 , Emperor Ming posthumously awarded officials who had died at Wang Dun 's hands throughout the years with titles and honors . They also put the general Tao Kan , known for their military and governing capabilities , in charge of most of Wang Dun 's former domain , including the key Jing Province ( 荊州 , modern Hubei ) .
In fall 325 , Emperor Ming grew ill . They entrusted their four-year-old son , Crown Prince Yan , to a group of high-level officials , including Sima Yang ( 司馬羕 ) the Prince of Xiyang , Wang Dao , Bian Kun ( 卞壼 ) , Chi Jian , Yu Liang , Lu Ye ( 陸瞱 ) , and Wen Jiao , perhaps intending that they lead by group with a balance of power . They died soon thereafter—only 26 years old . The balance of power that they left was soon broken , however , as Empress Dowager Yu became the regent , and their brother Yu Liang became the most powerful of the officials , eventually offending Su Jun and Zu Yue into a rebellion that damaged Jin for years .

The E. F. Barrett Power Station ( also known as the Island Park Energy Center ) is a power plant in Nassau County , New York , United States . The main plant is in Barnum Island , but outlying facilities are in neighboring Island Park and Oceanside . It is operated by National Grid USA .
Description
E. F. Barrett is the second largest power generation facility on Long Island by nameplate capacity behind Northport Power Station , and the third in net energy generated in 2020 , behind Northport and Caithness Long Island Energy Center . It is operated by National Grid USA , and the electricity generated at the plant is distributed across Long Island via the Long Island Power Authority 's electrical transmission network .
As of 2021 , E. F. Barrett consists of two steam turbine units with a nameplate capacity of 188.0 MW each , as well as eight gas turbine units with a nameplate capacity of 18 MW each and four jet engine units with a nameplate capacity of 41.8 MW each , for a total of 669.2 MW . In 2020 , the steam turbine units together generated 1286.9 GWh of energy , while the gas turbine and jet engine units together produced 98.0 GWh . All units are primarily fueled by natural gas , although they also have the capability of burning fuel oil as well .
The Transcontinental Pipeline terminates at the Island Park Energy Center , and the plant draws its natural gas supply from the pipeline . The E. F. Barrett facility is also planned to serve the interconnection point for the Empire Wind offshore wind farm project , after State Senator Todd Kaminsky and Island Park Mayor Michael McGinty lobbied for the connection to be moved from the originally planned Gowanus Substation in Brooklyn .
The facility occupies around 127 acres . The main steam plant is in the Barnum Island census-designated place , while a parcel north of Barnum 's Channel in Oceanside houses the gas turbine generators , and a parcel across the Long Beach Branch railroad tracks in Island Park hosts fuel tanks . At , the tallest of E. F. Barrett 's smoke stacks is among the tallest structures on Long Island . The plant 's namesake , Edward F. Barrett , was the LILCO president during 1937–1953 , and died in 1958 .
History
The plant was constructed by the Long Island Lighting Company ( LILCO ) . The two main steam turbine units began operating in 1956 and 1963 . The first unit was contemporaneous with three similar units constructed at the existing Glenwood Generating Station and the new Far Rockaway Power Station . While both units originally burned coal , they would later be converted to burn natural gas or fuel oil . Two more units were originally planned for the site , but because Barnum 's Channel would not provide sufficient cooling water for four generators , they were constructed at the Port Jefferson Power Station instead . Eight GE Frame 5 gas turbine generators began operating in 1970 , followed by four Pratt and Whitney GG4 Twin Pack generators in 1971 .
In 1998 , as part of a state-brokered deal , LILCO 's power generation facilities , including E. F. Barrett , were absorbed into KeySpan Energy , with the public Long Island Power Authority ( LIPA ) taking over transmission and delivery functions . KeySpan was acquired by National Grid in 2007 .
National Grid applied in 2013 to re-power the plant and increase its capacity . The proposal was to replace the current units with one or two combined cycle power plants and potentially additional simple cycle peaking plants . However , a 2017 study by LIPA and PSEG Long Island concluded that , while re-powering the plant was technically feasible and would be more efficient and have less environmental impact , the cost made it economically infeasible , and Long Island 's power demand had plateaued over the long term . The next year , officials from the Town of Hempstead and Island Park urged LIPA to reconsider the study 's conclusion .
E. F. Barrett was also subject to challenges against the power plant 's tax assessment . LILCO had initialed challenges against several plants including E. F. Barrett in the early 1990s , but these were dropped in 2004 after they had been inherited by LIPA . LIPA reinstated these challenges in 2010 . In 2019 , LIPA settled with Nassau County to halve its tax payments on E. F. Barrett over seven years . Island Park School District sued to prevent the deal , on the basis of a claimed 1998 agreement between LIPA , Governor George Pataki , and the taxing authorities that LIPA would not grieve its taxes on the plants , although the suit was expected to fail . Both Island Park and Oceanside School District stood to lose significant tax revenues on the deal , and would have to raise taxes on residents to compensate .

Pkhovi ( ) , also known as Pkhoet ' i ( ფხოეთი ) , is a medieval term for the mountainous district in northeast Georgia comprising the latter-day provinces of Pshavi and Khevsureti along the upper reaches of the Aragvi , and in three alpine valleys just north of the main crest of the Greater Caucasus . Today it is territory of Dusheti Municipality , Mtskheta-Mtianeti region .
History
Inhabitants of Pkhovi – the Pkhovians ( ფხო [ ვ ] ელნი , Pkho [ v ] elni ) – were a tribe of Georgian highlanders known for their warlike character and frequent disobedience to the royal authority .
The toponym Pkhovi , which may derive from a Georgian root meaning `` brave , valiant '' , is first attested in a passage from the seventh-century chronicle The Conversion of Kartli which refers to the defiance of local highlanders to Christianizing efforts of the king Mirian III , and St. Nino , a 4th-century apostle of eastern Georgia ( Kartli/Iberia ) . These pressures are reported to have forced several Pkhovian families to move southeast to Tusheti .
Although the population of this region was nominally under the direct rule of the Georgian crown , they had never been completely integrated into the feudal system of medieval Georgia , and remained relatively little affected by implantation of aristocratic landowners as well as foreign intrusions . However , as Professor Kevin Tuite of Université de Montréal has recently suggested ,
The position of the Georgian Orthodox Church was also weak , and the Pkhovians professed a curious mixture of pagan and Christian beliefs . This has reflected in the religious architecture of Pkhovi : whereas each village of other highland provinces of Georgia , such as Svaneti , Khevi , Mtiuleti , and Racha , has at least one church dating from the 5th to the 18th century , Pkhovi appears to be devoid of Georgian Orthodox churches . Instead , the region abounds in sacred sites , of which the most venerated are referred to as khati or jvari , meaning `` an icon '' and `` a cross '' in standard Georgian usage , but denoting , beyond these sacred images , the sanctuaries in which they are housed , and the deity believed to preside over the sanctuary in Pkhovi .
The refractory independence of Pkhovi 's mountainous clans led to the sporadic incursions of royal troops bent on forcing them into submission . One of the most devastating expeditions against the Pkhovians was organized , c. 1212 , at the behest of the queen Tamar of Georgia who presided over the Golden Age of the Kingdom of Georgia . The contemporary chronicle recounts a bloody three-month campaign of pacification by Tamar 's general Ivane the atabek , that left several Pkhovian villages and shrines destroyed .
The term Pkhovi disappeared in the 15th century and was replaced with the toponyms : Pshavi and Khevsureti . It has survived , however , in the name of the village Shuapkho ( shua- meaning `` middle '' in Georgian ) , and the Vainakh designation for the Khevsurs – Pkhia ( Пхий ) .

Kunzea juniperoides is a flowering plant in the myrtle family , Myrtaceae and is endemic to a small area of New South Wales . It is a small shrub with narrow leaves and small groups of white flowers near the end of the longer branches . It is distinguished from similar kunzeas by the large number of scale-like perules and bracts surrounding the groups of flowers .
Description
Kunzea juniperoides is a shrub which grows to a height of with its branches hairy when young . The leaves are linear in shape , long and less than wide with a petiole less than long . The flowers are arranged in groups of mostly three to eight near the ends of the branches . There are large numbers of broadly egg-shaped bracts long and wide and smaller paired bracteoles at the base of the flowers . The floral cup is hairy and about long . The sepal lobes are egg-shaped to triangular , about long and glabrous . The petals are white , egg-shaped to almost round and about long . There are about 30-35 stamens which are about long .
Taxonomy and naming
Kunzea juniperoides was first formally described in 2016 by Hellmut R. Toelken and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden . The specific epithet ( juniperoides ) refers to the similarity of the leaves of this species to those of miniature forms of Juniperus communis . ( The suffix -oides means `` likeness '' in Latin . )
There are two subspecies :
Kunzea juniperoides subsp . juniperoides which has leaves which are mostly long and grows in low heath near Braidwood ;
Kunzea juniperoides subsp . pervervosa which has leaves which are mostly long and grows in woodland on the Pigeon House Range .
Distribution and habitat
This kunzea grows in heath and woodland on the South Coast and nearby tablelands of New South Wales .

Signaling
Lines 3 and 4 has been operating over capacity due to large passenger flows for a number of years . With the continuous extensions of operating time , the problems of aging equipment and increasing passenger demand will further increase the operating pressure of the two lines . In June 2021 it was announced that Shanghai Metro has started to update of the signal system of lines 3 and 4 and finish before December 31 , 2024 .
These are the last lines in the system that are equipped with fixed block Alstom URBALISTM 200 system , not equipped with CBTC systems capable of headways as low as 90 seconds . CASCO successfully won the bid for the renewal and transformation of the signaling for lines 3 and 4 using its self-developed Qiji TACS system .

Since 2005 , Creighton and St. Joseph 's have had an agreement that sends Creighton medical students to Phoenix for one-month rotations . Under the new affiliation , Creighton will establish a fully operational campus at St. Joseph 's that will offer two full years of clinical training . Creighton expanded its entering medical class from 126 to 152 students in 2010 . All students will train for their first two years in Omaha . Starting in 2012 , 42 third-year students will move to Phoenix for their final two years of training , and 110 third-year students will remain in Omaha . The Phoenix campus will graduate its first students in 2014 .
Student clubs and organizations
Service
Creighton emphasizes community service , and even though it is not required , 100 % of students participate in some form of service during their time in medical school . Creighton students operate and staff the Magis Clinic , which provides free health care to the homeless and poor in Omaha .

The palmetto weevil ( Rhynchophorus cruentatus ) is an insect native to Florida , but has been found as far as southern Texas to the west and South Carolina to the north . It is the largest weevil in North America and the only kind of palm weevil in the continental United States . It infests palms and is considered a pest . Its main target is the Canary Island date palm , but date palms ( a different species than the Canary Island date palm ) , sabal palms ( the palmetto weevil 's traditional target ) , saw palmetto ( the palmetto weevil 's traditional alternative target ) , Washingtonia , Pritchardia , royal palms , Latania , coconut palms , Caryota , and Bismarckia are also susceptible . Distressed palm trees are usually attacked , which makes transplanted trees a frequent target . The Palmetto Weevils mate at the base of the palm branches where the females deposit their eggs . The grubs then eat into the palm tree , killing it . After the larvae have turned into adult weevils , the damage can be seen , but by then , it is considered to be too late for the tree . The life cycle from egg to adult for a palmetto weevil is about 84 days . For prevention , it is recommended an appropriate insecticidal crown drench is done twice a year for high value palms .
Grubs of other species of palm weevils are considered a delicacy in countries outside the United States .
Palmetto weevil are most active in late spring and early summer .

Ann O'Brien is a comic book superhero created by American comic book artist Art Adams . Along with Axwell Tiberius , they are one of the two primary characters in Adams ' Dark Horse Comics series Monkeyman and O'Brien .
Publication history
Ann O'Brien was created by writer/artist Art Adams , who conceived of Monkeyman & O'Brien as series that would enable them to draw monsters similar to the classic movie monsters that they enjoyed in their youth , like Godzilla , King Kong and the Universal Monsters . Adams named O'Brien in tribute to Fay Wray 's character , Ann Darrow , from King Kong and that film 's special effects creator Willis O'Brien ,
The character debuted in Dark Horse Presents # 80 ( December 1993 ) in a story titled `` A Monkeyman & O'Brien Adventure : Tortorus '' . They next appeared in a backup story entitled `` Who Are Monkeyman and O'Brien ? '' in Mike Mignola 's 1994 series Hellboy : Seed of Destruction . The character made further appearances in several short stories in Dark Horse Presents , a three book limited series titled Monkeyman and O'Brien ( 1996 ) , and a crossover miniseries Gen 13/Monkeyman and O'Brien ( 1998 ) . The character 's last published appearance was in 1999 in a comic strip in Dark Horse Extra , newspaper style comics fanzine .
Fictional character biography
Ann Darrow O'Brien is the daughter of scientist and explorer , Professor William S. O'Brien . Missing for two years , Professor O'Brien left their daughter Ann and their assistant Akiko Oki living in their palatial Bay Area estate . To the surprise of many , the young Ann had been keeping the estate solvent . Ann 's amoral half-sister Oniko ( who left the family 15 years earlier to join a mysterious criminal enterprise ) and their two henchmen invade the estate to take it over . The sisters have a brawl in an unused dimensional transportation chamber , and Ann accidentally hits a button that kicks off a `` life form retrieval beam . '' The chamber explodes as it summons the giant , simian genius Axewell Tiberius , who 's combating an unknown , ape-like enemy . The henchmen escape with Oniko and the still-living head of Tiberius ' enemy , while Ann and Akiko befriend Tiberius and give them a place in the estate 's library .
O'Brien discovers that the blast in the chamber had released a mysterious radiation that affects both them and Oniko . Immediately after the explosion , their eyes turn orange—the same color as Tiberius 's . The next night , they need almost no sleep to feel refreshed . The next day they find that their sneakers no longer fit their feet : `` I was growing faster than a teenager ! '' They perform better and better at physical tasks , lifting tons of free weights and at one point making a 60-mile run in 30 minutes without much effort . They fret a little about the ongoing growth spurts ( wasting plenty of money on clothes that become too small in 24 hours ) , but finally settles in at seven feet tall and 250 pounds .
Them new strength , size , and knowledge ( from working alongside Tiberius ) transform O'Brien from an estate manager to a renowned and fearless adventurer . They join Tiberius in a series of 1960s-inspired adventures , only a few of which are delineated in the comics . ( Author/artist Adams makes references to more adventures , like the `` Shrieking Bin-Yak , '' which are never seen by the readers . ) Them eventual goal : Help Tiberius find a way to their home world dimension .
Personality and powers
O'Brien has superhuman strength , superhuman speed , superhuman durability , superhuman agility , superhuman stamina , invulnerability , and the ability to heal quickly from injury . Them strength increases when they get very angry . In a crossover with Gen 13 , they were able to defeat an evil version of Caitlin Fairchild with some ease - they had to hold back some of their strength so as not to kill them Fairchild has many feats with which they could be listed in a `` Class 100 '' level of strength . This would mean O'brien is above this level as well . In Monkeyman and O'Brien # 3 they are bitten by the Shrewmanoid , bleeds , and then heals within seconds .

The Motorola Saber portable radio is a product series of Motorola USA , Inc . The Saber is a commercial radio that was developed for the U.S. military sometime around 1989 . The Saber is widely recognizable by thin , sleek design compared to other radios at the time . Despite the fact that the Saber was originally marketed to the military , many law enforcement agencies and fire departments realized the benefits of the Saber and Motorola soon had a much larger customer base for the radio than they expected .
Saber Conventional
The first Saber line was Conventional operation only . The conventional Sabers were capable of PL/DPL and were encryption capable . The Saber came in 4 different flavors ; I , II , III , and IE . The Model I have 12 channels in 1 zone , and no display or keypad . The IE was a Model I with an additional zone of 12 channels , 24 in all . The Model II is either capable of 4 or 10 zones , for a total of 48 or 120 channels . This is dependent on the memory . It has a backlight display which was capable of 5 alphanumeric characters if you have the 120 channel 2 KB version or the basic zone/channel display for the 48 channel version . It came with 3 softkeys to access menu options . The Model III was basically a Model II with a full DTMF keypad .
Systems Saber
The Systems Saber added analog trunking operation , direct access to functions via the keypad ( on the Systems Saber III ) , and increased channel capacity to a then-unheard of 255 conventional channels . The Systems Saber also increased the number of channels per zone to sixteen and added the ability to reprogram the function of many of the controls .
ASTRO™ Digital Saber
The Astro Saber was introduced in the mid 1990s and was a technologically advanced and state of the art at the time . The Astro Saber is feature packed Not only is it capable of IMBE Digital and conventional analog on a per-channel basis , but also some models are 12.5/25 kHz per channel as well .

David Albright , M.Sc. , is an American physicist and a weapons expert who is the founder of the non-governmental Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS ) , its current president , and author of several books on proliferation of atomic weapons . Albright holds a Master of Science in physics from Indiana University and an MSc in mathematics from Wright State University . They have taught physics at George Mason University in Virginia .
From 1990 to 2001 , Albright was a member of the Colorado State Health Advisory Panel , participating in its assessment of the toxicological and radiological effects on the population near the Rocky Flats atomic weapons production site .
From 1992 to 1997 , David Albright was associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency 's Action Team . In June 1996 , they were invited to be the first non-governmental inspector of Iraq 's nuclear program and questioned Iraqi officials about that country 's uranium enrichment program .
In 2001 , Albright prepared an analysis , for CNN , of documents found in an abandoned Al Qaeda safe house in Kabul believed to have been used by Abu Khabbab , who they described as `` Osama bin Laden 's top chemical and biological weapons commander '' . Albright confirmed that the abandoned documents included plans for a nuclear bomb and extensive training notes on the handling of radiological material .
In September 2002 , Albright and their organization ISIS were the first to publicly criticize the claims of the Bush administration and the CIA about the infamous Iraqi aluminum tubes . In response to Iraqi aluminum tubes , Albright said it was far from clear that the tubes were intended for a uranium centrifuge . The August/September 2003 American Journalism Review states : On December 8 [ 2002 ] Bob Simon reported on 60 Minutes that the aluminum tubes story was being challenged . They quoted British intelligence officials and David Albright , a weapons inspector in Iraq for the U.N. in the 1990s . Albright said , `` People who understood gas centrifuges almost uniformly felt that these tubes were not specific to gas centrifuge use . '' Simon said to Albright : `` It seems that what you 're suggesting is that the administration 's leak to the New York Times , regarding aluminum tubes , was misleading ? '' Albright : `` Oh , I think it was . I think—I think it was very misleading . `` .Albright stated : `` If the U.S. government puts out bad information it runs a risk of undermining the good information it possesses . In this case , I fear that the information was put out there for a short-term political goal : to convince people that Saddam Hussein is close to acquiring nuclear weapons . ''
Albright subsequently exposed flaws in the Bush administration 's other so-called nuclear evidence in the run-up to the Iraq war . Prior to the start of the war , they also became sceptical that Iraq had sizeable stocks of chemical and biological weapons .
A National Journal profile in 2004 called Albright a `` go-to guy for media people seeking independent analysis on Iraq 's [ weapons of mass destruction ] programs '' .
In 2006 , Albright received the prestigious Joseph A. Burton Forum Award from the American Physical Society , a professional society of American physicists . They were cited `` For their tireless and productive efforts to slow the transfer of nuclear weapons technology . They bring a unique combination of deep understanding , objectivity , and effectiveness to this vexed area ''
A report by Albright was quoted in a June 15 , 2008 article in The Washington Post . They stated in a leaked copy of a draft report ( to be released in full the week of June 15 , 2008 ) that a nuclear weapons smuggling ring—which sold bomb-related parts to Libya , North Korea , and Iran—possessed plans to an advanced nuclear device , compact enough to fit on a ballistic missile used by Iran and a dozen other developing countries . It was unknown if these plans had been shared with any regime ; and the plans had recently been destroyed .
Albright was a guest on The Colbert Report February 2011 and spoke about Stuxnet .

Baron Balfour of Glenawley or Clonawley , in the County of Fermanagh , was a title in the Peerage of Ireland . It was created in 1619 for Sir James Balfour , younger brother of Michael Balfour , 1st Lord Balfour of Burleigh . It refers to the barony of Clanawley ( Scoticised to Glenawley ) .
Balfour was the second son of judge James Balfour , Lord Pittendreich . They and their elder brother were granted lands in Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster . Lord Balfour of Glenawley was the largest of the undertakers in County Fermanagh , where they built Castle Balfour in Lisnaskea .
Lord Balfour died in October 1634 . They had two sons who survived him , but neither had heirs , and they died shortly after him .

Heist ( stylized as Hei $ t ) is a cancelled action-adventure video game that was developed by inXile Entertainment and would have been published by Codemasters for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . It was to be set in San Francisco , California , c. 1969 , following a group of criminals as they performed various thefts .
Plot
In 1969 , Johnny Sutton got out of jail where they ended up for committing a small robbery . They find out their father has passed away , leaving one big job unfinished in San Francisco Mint . Since Johnny is coming from a family of prominent thieves , which led them to follow their footsteps , being behind the bars just increased their desire to become the best bank robber of all time . They decide to finish what their dad was n't able to by putting together a crew .
Gameplay
Heist was planned to be an open world action game . Every operation had to be carefully assessed from the start by consulting Uncle Sal . In such case , they would lay out the security measures , vault details , skill level needed to crack the safe and camera positions . Johnny was able to inspect the banks as a regular customer in order to get an understanding of the locations . The plan was to have six main banks with their own designs and security , with additional twenty side banks in order to have the players improve their skills . During all missions , they would be joined by Crumb , Cracker and Kid . Each of them had their own strong points : Crumb relied on power and used a shotgun , Kid was useful in the getaways , while Cracker used their safe-cracking skills .
The Shot Calling feature allowed the players to assign the crew 's responsibilities , who would then perform their given roles . If the crew members thought they were more suitable elsewhere , they would notice Johnny or even decline the order for the tasks seen as impossible to complete . Besides the regular button press system for communication , Heist was also to include a voice-control option that allowed the players to give orders by using a microphone . All orders were tied to their separate commands , fully customizable at the same time . Depending on how the situation was being handled , the time limit to finish the job would change accordingly . The gameplay was designed to punish the players for their mistakes , relying on a domino effect as a consequence . If the players did n't bring together the customers and clerks , they could try to escape and set off the alarm through the front door or behind the cashier 's desk . The security guards would tend to pull out their guns at any time if the player does n't watch over them , resulting in the police being alerted by the people passing nearby and arriving as fast as possible . There was an implemented `` reprimand-and-reward '' system , where Johnny 's interactions with other teammates would affect their future behaviors . For example , if they praised or scolded one of them for what they have done , that person would remember that and act by it next time . The notoriety that was made to that point affected how would the police try to handle the team . It could also cause the civilians to start carrying guns and turn into vigilantes .
If the team managed to leave the bank , the getaway would start immediately . The goal was to get to a safe place while driving as Kid across the streets of San Francisco and avoiding road blocks on the way . The police could have been slowed by shooting at their vehicles , or by distracting them with roadside objects . Some other groups would also try to stop the gang , each with their own methods and strengths : FBI , National Guard , vigilantes and street thugs . Every vehicle possessed an individual value for both armor and health , which was upgraded both performance wise and visually . Between the main story jobs , the players were able to complete side missions with additional gear or money as a reward , such as robbing diners or making alliances with other gangs . The allies were set to help the gang during the escape by various measures , such as stage protests or trucks blocking the way .
Development
Initially , inXile had an agreement to develop an open-world project for PlayStation 3 in Unreal Engine , but they did n't know the specifications at the time , which led to performance issues related to random-access memory on the console .
With Scott Crisostomo as a lead designer , Heist was inspired by the '60s movies for the visual style , and several action movies for the overall feel , like Bullitt , Point Break and Dog Day Afternoon . The intent was to use the '60s rock and roll songs for the soundtrack . The developers used Need for Speed : Most Wanted as a reference for the car chases found in-game . The game was to be powered by PathEngine .
According to Brian Fargo , the development took a hit because of too much involvement by Codemasters .
Release
Heist was announced on March 20 , 2007 , with a scheduled release date of Q4 2007 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . A month later , it was presented on the publisher 's event Code 07 with a gameplay footage . At that point , Heist was about 30 to 35 percent complete . In December 2007 , the game was pushed to Q2 2008 as a part of the Codemasters 2008 lineup 's reveal . After missing out on summer 2008 release , there was little to no word about the state of the project since .
Cancellation
Codemasters announced on 28 January 2010 that the game had been cancelled . The British publisher furthered the statement by announcing it would no longer publish games developed by external studios .

Alexander Tornquist ( 18 June 1868 in Hamburg – 1 November 1944 , Graz ) was a German-Austrian geologist , who is known for their work on the northern part of the Trans European Suture Zone and on Mediterranean geology .
Biography
Alexander Tornquist was son of the merchant Alexander Heinrich Tornquist and Minna Mathilde Tornquist , née Fett . They studied at the universities of Freiburg , Munich and Göttingen . In 1892 they received a PhD in geology and paleontology at the university of Göttingen . In 1901 they obtained an associate professorship for geology and paleontology at Strasbourg , and in 1907 became a full professor at Königsberg . In Königsberg they also served as director of the famous Prussian amber collection and of the institute of seismology . They spent their later life in Graz , where they had a professorship at the Technische Hochschule from 1914 onward . From 1915 to 1918 , they served as dean to the chemo-technical faculty . From 1924 to 1926 , Tornquist was rector of the Technische Hochschule . Tornquistʹs bona fide involvement and expertise in the so called West-Styrian beryl-scandal around fraudster Emil Johann Paul Mehling ( alias Dr. Kurt Seidler ) in the years 1929/30 lead to their early retirement from the university in 1933 .
In 1897 , Alexander Tornquist married Anna Elisabeth Henze , who was born on 9 February 1877 in Dresden and daughter of a sculptor . They had five children . Their daughter Erika ( 1903–1962 ) was married to Caspar Neher who is known for their lifelong cooperation with Bertolt Brecht . Alexander Tornquistʹs son Martin Wolfgang Tornquist ( born on 31 May 1900 in Strasbourg ) was a painter and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts , Munich , where they befriended Neher . Martin was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1925 , repeatedly admitted to different psychiatric institutions and not released after a stay at the end of 1940 . They died on 11 February 1945 becoming thus a victim of so-called euthanasia .
Alexander Tornquist died in 1944 during an air raid on Graz , together with their wife and their sister Ellen Tornquist , who was born on 24 June 1872 in Hamburg and worked as a painter .

The Exies were an American rock band from Los Angeles , California , formed in 1997 . Their name , `` The Exies '' , is short for `` The Existentialists '' . Their two Virgin Records releases , Inertia ( 2003 ) and Head for the Door ( 2004 ) , have sold over 400,000 copies combined .
History
The Exies formed in 1997 when singer and guitarist Scott Stevens drafted bassist Freddy Herrera and drummer Thom Sullivan to form a new group . Stevens ' friend Chris Skane played guitar in an early incarnation of The Exies , but left citing other priorities . Skane was then replaced by guitarist David Walsh .
Stevens picked the name `` The Exies '' from a John Lennon biography , stating on Rockline ( 11/9/2002 ) that it was the only Beatles-related name left that was not taken . When the Beatles were touring around Hamburg , Germany in the 1960s , they encountered three distinct social groups among the kids : the mods , the rockers , and the art students ( who referred to themselves as `` the existentialists '' ) . John Lennon coined the term `` the exies '' to refer to the art students .
The band released their self-titled debut album in 2000 on Ultimatum Records , and toured extensively . While touring , they caught the attention of Grammy-winning record producer , Matt Serletic , who bought their contract from the indie label they were on .
Thom Sullivan and The Exies parted ways in September 2000 , and Dennis Wolfe joined the band . a few months later , one of their songs is featured on the animated series Gary & Mike . The majority of 2001 and early 2002 was spent writing and recording . The band began touring in August 2002 .
Inertia
In 2002 the band signed to Virgin Records and in January 2003 they released their second album , Inertia . The album received wide distribution , and their first single , `` My Goddess '' , received a fair amount of radio play and was featured in the PlayStation 2 game , Splashdown : Rides Gone Wild . The song `` Without '' was featured on the soundtrack for EA Sports MVP Baseball 2003 .
The Exies continued touring in 2003 in support of Inertia , with `` My Goddess '' being performed on the Late Show with David Letterman and peaking at No . 12 on Modern Rock chart . The video for `` My Goddess '' , filmed by Diane Martel , became a top 10 hit on MTV2 .
Inertia is The Exies ' most successful album , reaching # 115 on the Billboard 200 .
Head for the Door
In June 2004 , The Exies headed back into the studio with producer Nick Raskulinecz . Their third album Head for the Door was released in December 2004 . The album 's first single , `` Ugly '' , was used by World Wrestling Entertainment as the theme song for that year 's Survivor Series 2004 pay-per-view event in November 2004 , and was featured in a commercial for the Warner Bros. television network . The song `` Slow Drain '' was featured in the video game NFL Street 2 , which was released on the Xbox and PlayStation 2 consoles . The band promoted the album by opening for Velvet Revolver on their first arena tour .
Along with Sum 41 and Silvertide , The Exies supported Mötley Crüe on their Carnival of Sins Tour .
Their second single from Head for the Door , `` Hey You '' , is part of the PlayStation 2 video game , Guitar Hero , released in 2005 . It is also part of the Xbox 360 game Guitar Hero II via download through Xbox Live , along with Guitar Hero : Smash Hits on various consoles .
The song `` What You Deserve '' was also featured in the game Juiced .
The song `` Slow Drain '' was also featured in the games NFL Street 2 , and the PlayStation 3 version of Full Auto 2 .
A Modern Way of Living with the Truth
After returning from the tour with Mötley Crüe , Virgin decided to release the Exies from their contract . Soon after this , Dennis Wolfe and David Walsh left the band to pursue other goals . This left Stevens and Herrera alone , and decided to reunite with former guitarist Chris Skane and began writing songs . On 26 May 2006 , the band announced on its blog that they were returning to the studio with producer James Michael to work on their fourth album .

The 31st César Awards ceremony , presented by the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma , honoured the best films of 2005 in France and took place on 25 February 2006 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris . The ceremony was chaired by Carole Bouquet and hosted by Valérie Lemercier . The Beat That My Heart Skipped won the award for Best Film .
The ceremony was marred by demonstrations by the intermittents ( film industry workers ) , who lobbied for greater rights for temporary contract workers after running onto the stage before the start . The police had to evacuate the protesters , which ultimately led to a 23-minute delay to the start of the proceedings .

Orpheus vs. the Sirens is a studio album by Brownsville rapper Kaseem `` Ka '' Ryan and Los Angeles producer `` Animoss '' together known as Hermit and the Recluse . It was released on August 18 , 2018 via Obol for Charon Records . Recording sessions took place at Seaside Lounge in Brooklyn . Production was handled entirely by Animoss . It features a single guest appearance from Citizen Cope .
The album was promoted by three music videos : `` Sirens '' , directed by Alina Popescu , `` Argo '' and `` Oedipus '' , both directed by Animoss and Ka .
Critical reception
Orpheus vs. the Sirens was met with generally favorable reviews from critics . At Album of the Year , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 83 based on four reviews .
Evan Coral of Tiny Mix Tapes said , `` The self-mythologizing that Ka composes on Orpheus vs. the Sirens constitutes a minoritarian epic that resounds with the properly poetic catharsis that might purge the constraints from a life 's definition '' . Torii MacAdams of Pitchfork said , `` In a twist , the Brownsville rapper projects the streetwise narratives of their youth through the lens of Greek mythology—an audacious move , but their hypnotic voice and evocative writing pull it off '' . M.T . Richards of Exclaim ! said , `` Ka 's music will be a tough sell for hip-hop fans accustomed to baroque maximalism . Orpheus vs. the Sirens is almost confrontationally intimate ; long stretches pass without any percussion at all '' .

Events
Afghanistan passes through the year peaceably and the relations of the country with the Indian government are most cordial . Afghanistan presents in these respects a marked contrast to its neighbour , Persia . Both Persia and Afghanistan are nominally sovereign states , but in practice the British Raj is the supreme protecting power in Afghanistan , whereas in Persia , the paramount power is Russia rather than the United Kingdom . The difference between the conditions prevailing in the two countries indicates the success of the British in gaining the confidence of a weak nation .

is a 2010 kart racing video game , produced for Wii , Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , Nintendo DS ( February 23 , 2010 ) , and Microsoft Windows ( March 3 , 2010 ) , featuring characters from multiple Sega franchises . The game is the third title in the Sega All-Stars series , preceded by Sega Superstars Tennis . A mobile version was developed by Gameloft , and released for iOS in June 2011 , as a paid download . A version for OS X was released by Feral Interactive in April 2013 .
The game received mostly positive reviews from critics . A sequel , Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed , was released in 2012 , featuring more characters and representing a wide-variety of Sega-owned franchises .
Gameplay
The game is a mascot kart racing game , similar to other games in its genre like Mario Kart , Konami Krazy Racers and Crash Team Racing . Players can choose to race as one of 20 characters from various Sega franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog , Crazy Taxi , and Fantasy Zone . Characters race through various race circuits themed on different Sega franchises and collect power-ups to boost their speed or hamper their opponents . The items have a rock-paper-scissors effect , in which certain items can be used to defend against others . Also , on occasions when players get three of one item , they can choose to fire/activate them at the same time . Additional boost can be earned by successfully executing drifts ( with longer drifts earning more boost ) , or performing tricks while in midair . Like Sumo 's previous Sega game , Sega Superstars Tennis , each character has a special ability ( called an `` All-Star Move '' ) unique to them that they may use to their advantage ( such as Sonic transforming into Super Sonic and AiAi riding in their monkey ball ) , which they can obtain if they are running behind in the race . How long each All-Star move lasts depends on the character 's current position . Due to network latency issues , All-Star Moves are not possible in online races .
Vehicles are separated into 3 different categories : cars , bikes and hovercraft . As the terrain on the tracks will vary , vehicles can be either assisted or hindered by the surfaces they drive upon . Cars vary in weight and speed , with some performing better on some terrains than others . Bikes have fast acceleration and can also perform ground tricks for extra boost , but can easily be bullied by heavier vehicles . Hovercraft are not affected by any terrain and are able to perform multiple tricks after a jump , but they have poorer handling and have low acceleration . All of the vehicles also have their own specific engine sounds .
By playing through the game , players can earn Sega Miles that can be spent in the in-game shop to unlock additional content such as characters , tracks , and songs . The game features a total of 24 tracks based on locations from Sonic Heroes , Super Monkey Ball : Banana Blitz , Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg , Jet Set Radio Future , Samba de Amigo , and The House of the Dead .
There are four single player modes : Grand Prix , Single Race , Missions and Time Trials , while modes for split-screen multiplayer , playable with up to 4 players , include Free Race , Arena , King of the Hill , Collect the Emeralds and Capture the Chao . The game also has customizable multiplayer options for up to 8 players online ( 4 players on DS version , no online support for PC version ) .
The soundtrack for the game consists of various old and new tracks from the various Sonic and Sega franchises , though it also features original songs by various artists including Richard Jacques . Each course starts with one track , with more being unlocked as players earn Sega Miles . The Nintendo DS version of the game features MIDI versions of the tracks arranged by Allister Brimble and Anthony Putson of Orchestral Media Developments .
Characters
Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing features 20 playable characters , 12 of which must be unlocked through gameplay . Three additional characters originating from non-Sega properties are available only on specific consoles , while two additional characters were released as paid downloadable content for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions .
Notes
Development
Following the release of Sega Superstars Tennis , Sumo Digital decided to do a racing title , based on their experience with recent Out Run titles . In an early prototype of the game , Sonic raced on foot , Dr. Eggman rode an Eggpod with legs , Tails flew in a biplane , Amy Rose drove a car , and Gilius Thunderhead from Golden Axe rode one of the Chickenleg creatures from the game . This version , however , was reportedly not fun to play , largely due to the varying sizes between the different characters , but also because the drift mechanic would n't work with racers who were on foot . It was later revised so that everyone would be in cars , bikes , or modified flyers . The game is also the last in the series to utilize the Sonic the Hedgehog voice cast from 4Kids Entertainment that was first introduced with the English-language release of Sonic X in 2003 ( with the exception of Mike Pollock who continues to voice Dr. Eggman ) .
At Summer of Sonic 2009 , Steve Lycett , executive producer and Travis Ryan , lead designer of Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing were present for a Q & A session . A PlayStation 3 demo was also available for attendees to play . It was identical to the Comic-Con demo . On November 25 , 2009 , a special press event about the game was held in France , where the DS version made its playable debut .
Banjo and Kazooie from the Banjo-Kazooie series appear as a playable character exclusive to the Xbox 360 version of the game , based on their appearance in Banjo-Kazooie : Nuts & Bolts . Sumo collaborated with Banjo-Kazooie development studio Rare for the character 's inclusion , with Rare giving Sumo access to their asset library as well as designing and modeling Banjo and Kazooie 's in-game vehicle . The Xbox 360 version also features playable Avatars , while the Wii version includes playable Miis .
Three demos of the game were released : The first , for the Xbox 360 , was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on February 8 , 2010 . The second , for the Nintendo DS , was released via the Nintendo Channel on February 15 , 2010 . The third , for the PlayStation 3 , was made available on the PlayStation Network Store on February 18 , 2010 .
Planned characters
ToeJam & Earl were originally planned to be in Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing as a duo driving their spaceship , but Sega could not come to terms with ToeJam & Earl Productions co-founder Greg Johnson . However , fans have called and mass-emailed Johnson for their characters ' return . They have responded on the official Sega forums under the pseudonym 'Big Earl ' stating `` I 'll give it another try and see if I can get the homies at Sega to talk again on the phone . '' They later mentioned that the duo will not be appearing in the game , since it is too late in development .
In its prototype form , Gilius Thunderhead from Golden Axe was a playable character who rode one of the Chickenleg monsters from the game . In their developer diary , Lycett makes it clear that this does not confirm them as a final character . This is the case with Gilius , as they did not make the cut into the final roster . Lycett has also talked about Vyse from Skies of Arcadia in an interview with Gamereactor . Segata Sanshiro was also considered as a possible character , riding a Sega Saturn , though they did not end up in the roster . Early in development , Mario was considered as a Wii-exclusive addition , but Sega decided against it so as not to cause cross-contamination with its Mario and Sonic series .
Lycett has also mentioned there will be various cameo appearances from other Sega characters who did n't make it in the playable roster . Following a successful fan campaign for the character 's inclusion , Nights was integrated into the game as the flagman .
Downloadable content
Producer Omar Woodley confirmed in an interview that there would be DLC for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game . Lycett has mentioned that the Wii wo n't receive any DLC due to storage limits . As a pre-order bonus for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions in PAL regions , an alternate version of Ryo Hazuki was made available to download in which they would drive their forklift outside their All-Star move as their standard vehicle . This character was later made available for purchase on April 1 , 2010 .
Exclusive DLC for the Xbox 360 version include a game add-on that unlocks all characters and tracks without using SEGA miles , released March 16 , 2010 . Avatar content for the game was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on March 25 , 2010 . A pack containing Metal Sonic as a playable character and the `` Death Egg Hangar '' track , with Ristar as a cameo appearance , was officially released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 8 , 2010 , and the PlayStation Store on April 22 , 2010 .
Reception
The game received mostly positive scores . IGN gave both the console and DS versions 8/10 each , calling it ' a clone that gets it right . ' GameSpot also gave it 8/10 , praising its responsive controls and excellent track design . Kotaku called it a competent racer which evokes fond memories , although laments that the tracks and music selection do n't delve as deep into Sega lore as the character roster . GameTrailers gave the game 8.0 as well , praising its track design and addictive gameplay . GamesMaster gave the game 83 % for the console versions and 70 % for the DS version , calling it 'the best kart racer on 360/PS3 , but not quite the Mario Kart-beater we hoped for ' . Nintendo Power gave the Wii version 8/10 and the DS version 6/10 . Official Nintendo Magazine gave both the DS and Wii version 75 % . Wiiloveit.com gave the game a 27/30 calling it an `` excellent kart racer '' , praising its `` natural '' drifting mechanics , the varied multiplayer modes , as well as the large amount of `` fan service '' that exists in the game . The online incorporation was praised , however it was also commented that it could 've been stronger had there been additional modes , a stronger setup , and some sort of ranking system . GamesRadar gave the console versions of the game 8/10 , praising its pick-up-and-play fun while criticising its uninspired weapons , whereas the DS version got 7/10 .
By March 2010 , Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing had sold 1.07 million copies worldwide , on the PS3 , Xbox 360 , Wii and DS . On iOS , the game hit more than 16.7million downloads in North America and Europe as of 2013 , including free downloads for a week in June 2012 .
Sequel
At the 2012 Toy Fair in New York City , Sega revealed a new toyline based on the game and confirmed to Kotaku that a sequel was in production , to be revealed later in 2012 . The game was later announced as Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed , and was released for Wii U , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation Vita , and Xbox 360 in 2012 , Nintendo 3DS and Microsoft Windows in 2013 and iOS and Android in 2014 .

A member of the Republican Party , they previously served as a United States Senator from Idaho from 1993 to 1999 and the 30th governor of Idaho from 1999 to 2006 .
Kempthorne was first elected to public office as Mayor of Boise in 1985 , where they served for seven years . They serve as a co-chair of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center . In November 2010 , they were appointed president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers .
Early life , education and early career

They attended and graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino , attended San Bernardino Valley College , then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow , where they graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science , and served a term as student body president . Upon graduation Kempthorne served as an assistant to the director of the Idaho Department of Lands and then as executive vice president of the Idaho Home Builders Association .

Kempthorne is of Cornish ancestry .
Political career
Mayor of Boise
Kempthorne 's first major political victory came at age 34 , when they were elected mayor of Boise in 1985 . As mayor , Kempthorne became very popular and was unopposed for reelection in 1989 .
U.S. Senate
In 1992 , U.S . Senator Steve Symms decided not to seek a third term and Kempthorne pursued the Republican nomination for the seat . In the general election , Kempthorne defeated Democratic U.S. Representative Richard H. Stallings .
In the Senate , Kempthorne sponsored and helped pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 , a bill meant to prohibit Congress from imposing unfunded federal mandates on states . The bill aimed to :
[ C ] urb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments ; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State , local and tribal governments ; to end the imposition , in the absence of full consideration by Congress , of Federal mandates on State , local , and tribal governments without adequate funding , in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities ; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations , and for other purposes .
Also in 1995 , Senator Kempthorne introduced amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act . This bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 6 , 1996 .
During their six years in the Senate , Kempthorne scored a `` 0 '' on the League of Conservation Voters ' legislative scorecards every year except 1993 , when they scored 6 percent on the basis of one vote against funding a rocket booster for the space program that environmentalists judged harmful to the environment . Their overall LCV score for that period was less than 1 % .

Governor of Idaho
Kempthorne was expected to run for reelection in 1998 , but instead decided to run for the open seat for governor . The incumbent , Phil Batt , shocked the state by announcing their retirement after only one term in office , citing their age ( 71 ) as the prime factor in their decision . Kempthorne 's Senate seat would be won by Republican member of congress Mike Crapo of Idaho Falls .
Kempthorne won the gubernatorial election in a landslide , receiving 68 percent of the vote while their Democratic opponent , Robert C. Huntley , received only 29 percent . They were reelected in 2002 with 56 percent of the vote , compared to their Democratic opponent , Jerry Brady , who polled 42 percent . Kempthorne 's campaign spent nearly $ 200,000 more than it had received in contributions prior to the election ; they spent the next two years raising funds to pay off the campaign debt .
U.S. Secretary of the Interior
On March 16 , 2006 , Kempthorne was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Gale Norton as the 49th Secretary of the Interior . On May 10 , 2006 , Kempthorne 's nomination was approved by voice vote by the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources . They were confirmed by the full Senate on May 26 and resigned as Idaho Governor to accept the position the same day . Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch succeeded Kempthorne as Idaho Governor , filling out the remaining months of their term . Kempthorne is the second Idahoan to hold the Cabinet post . Former Governor Cecil Andrus was the Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter , serving from 1977 to 1981 .
Upon Kempthorne 's appointment as Secretary of the Interior , environmental groups characterized them as someone who has `` almost always favored changing laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to make them more favorable to commercial interests . ''
As Secretary of the Interior , Kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since their confirmation on May 26 , 2006 . As of September 2007 , Kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over their tenure than any Interior Secretary in United States history , a record previously held by James G. Watt for over 20 years .
In December 2007 , as a result of a long-term investigation and resignation of former Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald , Inspector General Earl Devaney found `` abrupt and abrasive , if not abusive '' management at the department under Kempthorne 's supervision . U.S . Senator Ron Wyden , chairperson of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests , attributed the `` untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers ' dollars '' to MacDonald 's actions . Of the department , Representative Nick J. Rahall II , chairperson of the House Natural Resources said `` The results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the Interior Department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another 's misdeeds . ''
In September 2008 , Devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service , an agency under Kempthorne 's administration that collects about $ 10 billion in oil and gas royalties annually , and one of the government 's largest sources of revenue other than taxes . According to The New York Times , `` Eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf , ski and paintball outings ; meals and drinks ; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert , a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game ... The investigation also concluded that several of the officials `` frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions , had used cocaine and marijuana , and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives . '' The New York Times reports a whistleblower had officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of 2006 , prior to Kempthorne 's being sworn into the office .
On December 16 , 2008 , the Center for Biological Diversity announced intent to sue the Interior Department under Kempthorne for introducing `` regulations ... that would eviscerate our nation 's most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities , including those that generate greenhouse gases , from review under the Endangered Species Act . '' The lawsuit , which is critical of policy advocated by Kempthorne and President George W. Bush , was filed in the Northern District of California by the CBD , Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife . According to the CBD , `` The lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and did not go through the required public review process . The regulations , first proposed on August 11th , were rushed by the Bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than 300,000 comments from the public were reviewed in 2-3 weeks , and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment , rather than a fuller environmental impact statement . ''
In 2009 , CNN correspondent Campbell Brown criticized Kempthorne for using `` $ 235,000 of [ taxpayer ] money to renovate their office bathroom at the Department of Interior . '' According to Brown , the costs included a shower , a refrigerator , and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling , as well as `` DK '' monogrammed towels . Donald Swain , Chief of the Interior Department 's National Business Center said the towels do not exist . They further say the project came in $ 10,000 under budget and was approved by the General Services Administration .

John Anderson Castello ( 1802 , British Guiana-1877 , Jamaica ) was a Guyanese child actor and journalist who established their reputation in Jamaica , whither they moved as a teenager . Following Master Betty , known as `` the Young Roscius '' , Castello was called `` the West Indian Roscius '' . They performed in Spanish Town in October 1816 at the age of thirteen . Castello remained popular with Jamaican theatre-goers until 1818 , when they reached puberty and their voice broke .
Theatrical career
William Adamson , who managed their own theatre company had arrived from Barbados , produced John Home 's Douglas or the Noble Shepherd and cast Castello in the role of the Young Norval . When they performed the role of Lothair in `` Monk '' Lewis ' Adelgitha , the author – who was in the audience – complained about the performance . With the death of Adamson that year , their replacement , Mr Burnett refused to pay them the same rate as adult members of the cast and their last performance with Burnett 's company took place in December 1818 . In July 1919 they appeared at the Pavilion Theatre , New York in the role of Caleb Quotem in George Colman 's play The Wags of Windsor . However no accounts of further theatrical performance exist until they resurfaced in Kingston Theatre , Jamaica in July 1828 where they delivered George Alexander Stevens 's comic monologue The Lecture on Heads . In 1829 they joined the English Company and continued to perform in Kingston .
Journalist career
In 1836 they bought the Falmouth Post which they then published and edited as weekly newspaper up until their death in 1877 .

Switzerland County is a county in the southeast corner of the U.S. state of Indiana . As of the 2010 United States Census , the population was 10,613 . The county seat is Vevay , one of two incorporated towns in the county .
History
In 1787 , the fledgling United States defined the Northwest Territory , which included the area of present-day Indiana . In 1800 , Congress separated Ohio from the Northwest Territory , designating the rest of the land as the Indiana Territory . President Thomas Jefferson chose William Henry Harrison as the territory 's first governor , and Vincennes was established as the territorial capital . After the Michigan Territory was separated and the Illinois Territory was formed , Indiana was reduced to its current size and geography . By December 1816 the Indiana Territory was admitted to the Union as a state .
Starting in 1794 , Native American titles to Indiana lands were extinguished by usurpation , purchase , or war and treaty . The United States acquired land from the Native Americans in the 1809 treaty of Fort Wayne , and by the treaty of St. Mary 's in 1818 , the SE portion of Indiana Territory was acquired for settlement .
The area included in present-day Switzerland County was first placed in Knox County , formed in 1790 . Parts of that extremely large county were partitioned off in 1803 to form Dearborn County and in 1810 to form Jefferson County . Settlers had been pouring into the extreme SE part of the Indiana Territory starting in 1795 , and by 1814 there was sufficient to further form a local governing body . Accordingly , the state legislature authorized Switzerland County effective 1 October 1814 , partitioning portions of Dearborn and Jefferson counties to make the creation . Four fledgling settlements were considered as the seat of government ( Vevay , Little York [ present-day Florence ] , Troy [ present-day Patriot ] , and Center Square ) . Center Square was nearest the geographic center and was the presumed site , but Vevay carried the day .
Several early settlers were originally from Switzerland . The first was probably Heathcoat Pickett , in 1795 . They were followed by John James Dufour ( 1796 ) , and the Dickason , Cotton , and Rayl families in 1798 . Pickett also made the area 's first flatboats ; they floated them ( loaded with goods for sale ) to New Orleans and sold the entire package , then walked back to Switzerland County . They made 20 such trips . Early county residents noted the passage of the first steamboat on the Ohio River in 1811 ; this form of transport quickly transformed the river into a conduit for commerce and travel . Although Indiana was criss-crossed with railroad tracks during the nineteenth century , none was laid to Switzerland County . This hindered its growth after the decline of steamboat travel .
Industrial wine grape production in Switzerland County earned the area the title `` The Rhineland of America '' .
Geography
Switzerland County lies at the SE tip of Indiana , with its southeastern border defined by the Ohio River ; the state of Kentucky abuts on the opposite shore . Its rolling hills were originally completely wooded . Its more flat areas have been cleared for agricultural or urban use , but its many drainages are still wooded . Its highest elevation ( 981 feet/299 meters ASL ) is a hill in its NW quadrant , 0.7 mile ( 1.1 km ) west of Avonburg .
According to the 2010 census , the county has a total area of , of which ( or 98.74 % ) is land and ( or 1.26 % ) is water .

In recent years , average temperatures in Vevay have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July , although a record low of was recorded in January 1977 and a record high of was recorded in July 1999 . Average monthly precipitation ranged from in February to in May .
Government
The county government is a constitutional body , and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana , and by the Indiana Code .
County Council : The legislative branch of the county government ; controls spending and revenue collection in the county . Representatives are elected to four-year terms from county districts . They set salaries , the annual budget , and special spending . The council has limited authority to impose local taxes , in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval , excise taxes , and service taxes .
Board of Commissioners : The executive body of the county ; commissioners are elected county-wide to staggered four-year terms . One commissioner serves as president . The commissioners execute acts legislated by the council , collect revenue , and manage the county government .
Court : The county maintains a circuit court which was established January 1 , 2009 . The first Judge of the Switzerland Circuit Court is W. Gregory Coy . The Judge is elected to a term of six years . The Court is a general jurisdiction court , meaning it handles all types of cases . The Judge must be a licensed attorney . All decisions of the Court are appealable to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Supreme Court .
County Officials : The county has other elected offices , including sheriff , coroner , auditor , treasurer , recorder , surveyor , and circuit court clerk . They are elected to four-year terms . Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and to be residents of the county .
Switzerland County is part of Indiana 's 6th congressional district .

Cake copyright is the assertion of copyright on a cake .
Copyright of art on cakes
Cakes can be an artistic medium for displaying any image or portraying any character . If a cake is used as an artistic medium for presenting copyrighted content , then copyright issues might come into play with a cake as with any other publication medium . Entertainment media organizations including Disney , Lucasfilm , and Sanrio have asserted that cakes should not portray their copyrighted fictional characters or their copyrighted images without licensing .
Copyright on cake design
Cake design is an imagining of a cake as copyrightable art , like a sculpture .
Bakeries which provide cakes which critics have ridiculed for low quality have sometimes sought to claim copyright over their cakes . The copyright claim is part of an attempt to enforce demands that communities of people who mock cakes not publish photos of cakes for entertainment .
Cake copyright at Trump inauguration
In 2012 in the United States President Obama had celebrity pastry chef Duff Goldman design a certain cake for a party celebrating their inauguration . In 2017 United States President Trump had a Washington , D.C. bakery replicate Obama 's cake made for their inauguration . There was discussion about whether Trump plagiarized Obama 's cake .
The matter raised the profile of copyright questions about cakes .

The 1961 Liberty Bowl was a college football postseason bowl game played on December 16 , 1961 . The third edition of the Liberty Bowl , the game featured the Syracuse Orangemen and the Miami Hurricanes , both independent programs .
Background
Syracuse running back Ernie Davis became the first African-American football player to win the Heisman Trophy . This was Syracuse 's fifth bowl game in 8 years . Miami was making their first bowl appearance since 1952 .
Game summary
Jim Vollenweider scored on a 12-yard touchdown run to give Miami a 6–0 lead ( though the extra point failed ) in the first quarter . Nick Spineli scored on a 60-yard punt return to add onto the lead , and George Mira scored on the conversion pass to make it 14–0 at halftime . Syracuse culminated a 42-yard drive with an Ernie Davis touchdown plunge to make it 14–8 ( with a Dave Sarette pass to Dick Easterly to get the two-point conversion ) . On the first play of the fourth quarter , Miami fumbled the ball , and Bill Schoonover recovered at the Orange 49 . Nine plays and 51 yards later , Sarette threw a touchdown pass to Easterly to make it 14–14 , with the extra point proving to be important . Ken Erickson 's extra point was good , as the Orange won , 15–14 . Ernie Davis rushed for 140 yards on 30 carries . Easterly caught four passes for 50 yards .
Aftermath
Davis died of leukemia before they ever played a snap in the National Football League . Miami returned to the Liberty Bowl in 1966 , while Syracuse returned in 1996 .

In control theory , a bang–bang controller ( 2 steps or on–off controller ) , is a feedback controller that switches abruptly between two states . These controllers may be realized in terms of any element that provides hysteresis . They are often used to control a plant that accepts a binary input , for example a furnace that is either completely on or completely off . Most common residential thermostats are bang–bang controllers . The Heaviside step function in its discrete form is an example of a bang–bang control signal . Due to the discontinuous control signal , systems that include bang–bang controllers are variable structure systems , and bang–bang controllers are thus variable structure controllers .
Bang–bang solutions in optimal control
In optimal control problems , it is sometimes the case that a control is restricted to be between a lower and an upper bound . If the optimal control switches from one extreme to the other ( i.e. , is strictly never in between the bounds ) , then that control is referred to as a bang-bang solution .
Bang–bang controls frequently arise in minimum-time problems . For example , if it is desired for a car starting at rest to arrive at a certain position ahead of the car in the shortest possible time , the solution is to apply maximum acceleration until the unique switching point , and then apply maximum braking to come to rest exactly at the desired position .
A familiar everyday example is bringing water to a boil in the shortest time , which is achieved by applying full heat , then turning it off when the water reaches a boil . A closed-loop household example is most thermostats , wherein the heating element or air conditioning compressor is either running or not , depending upon whether the measured temperature is above or below the setpoint .
Bang–bang solutions also arise when the Hamiltonian is linear in the control variable ; application of Pontryagin 's minimum or maximum principle will then lead to pushing the control to its upper or lower bound depending on the sign of the coefficient of u in the Hamiltonian .
In summary , bang–bang controls are actually optimal controls in some cases , although they are also often implemented because of simplicity or convenience .
Practical implications of bang-bang control
Mathematically or within a computing context there may
be no problems , but the physical realization of bang-bang
control systems give rise to several complications .
First , depending on the width of the hysteresis gap and inertia in the process , there will be an oscillating error signal around the desired set point value ( e.g. , temperature ) , often saw-tooth shaped . Room temperature may become uncomfortable just before the next switch 'ON ' event . Alternatively , a narrow hysteresis gap will lead to frequent
on/off switching , which is often undesirable ( e.g . an electrically ignited gas heater ) .
Second , the onset of the step function may entail , for example , a high electrical current and/or sudden heating and expansion of metal vessels , ultimately leading to metal fatigue or other wear-and-tear effects . Where possible , continuous control , such as in PID control will avoid problems caused by the brisk state transitions that are the consequence of bang-bang control .
Pulse-width modulation
A PID controller can send Pulse-width modulation control signals that reduce switching of motors , solenoids , etc . by setting `` minimum ON times '' and `` minimum OFF times . ''

Race & Class is a peer-reviewed academic journal on contemporary racism and imperialism . It is published quarterly by Sage Publications on behalf of the Institute of Race Relations and is interdisciplinary , publishing material across the humanities and social sciences .
History
The journal was established in 1959 as Race , before obtaining its current title in 1974 ( when it was subtitled Journal for Black and Third World Liberation ) . The new editor , Ambalavaner Sivanandan , rejected what they saw as the arid scholarship of its predecessor , calling out instead to the `` Third World intelligentsia , its radicals and political activists , its refugees and exiles '' .
Race & Class covered events that shaped the 1970s , specifically the period 's widespread and rapid social and political changes , liberation struggles and the installation of popular governments in some of the newly independent countries of the Third World , the phenomenon of Black Power , and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries . The journal was opened to radical scholars and activists , three of whom were so closely involved in the liberation movements they wrote of – Orlando Letelier , Malcolm Caldwell and Walter Rodney – they were killed in the pursuit of their realization .
Abstracting and indexing
The journal is abstracted and indexed by EBSCO databases , Current Contents/Social and Behavioral Sciences , International Bibliography of the Social Sciences , MLA International Bibliography , and the Social Sciences Citation Index . According to the Journal Citation Reports in 2011 , Race & Class had an impact factor of 0.302 , ranking it 59 out of 81 in the category `` Anthropology '' , 11 out of 14 in `` Ethnic Studies '' , 28 out of 38 in `` Social Issues '' , 66 out of 89 in `` Social Sciences , Interdisciplinary '' , and 107 out of 138 in `` Sociology '' .

Piotr Marian Massonius ( 1 February 1862 in Kursk , Russian Empire – 20 July 1945 in Vilnius ( Wilno ) , prewar Second Polish Republic ) was a Polish philosopher and teacher who was born into a family of expatriates during the Partitions of Poland .
Life
Massonius studied law at the Warsaw University and then abroad , where they took up philosophical and pedagogical studies at various German universities , mainly in Leipzig . They became one of the representatives of the Warsaw school of Positivism who formed a common front against Messianism together with the Polish Neo-Kantians .
Before Poland 's return to independence , Massonius wrote for the Polish-language St. Petersburg weekly Kraj and contributed to the Polish-language periodicals Głos , Tygodnik Ilustrowany , Wisła , Gazeta Warszawska and Gazeta Polska . In 1897-1914 they served on the editorial board of Przegląd Filozoficzny ( The Philosophical Review ) . In 1906 Massonius was elected to Russia 's first National Duma . In 1906-14 they lectured at Warsaw 's Flying University , and in 1920-32 , as a professor they conducted courses in philosophy and pedagogy at Stefan Batory University in Vilnius , then part of the Second Polish Republic ; in these , they focused on epistemology and aesthetics . They became dean of the Humanities Department there . Their writings included a collection of philosophical essays , and Polish translations of Western philosophers such as Immanuel Kant , Émile Tardieu and Schopenhauer .
On 21 September 1920 , in Poznań , Massonius published an essay On Bolshevism , including observations on the 1847 Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels . As one of the first Polish scholars following the 1917 Russian Revolution , they warned that communist ideology was merely a tool that enabled the Bolsheviks to assume the political role of a new ruling class in Russian society . Workers and peasants – Massonius wrote – were to become an embellishment for the commissars corresponding roughly to the former Tsarist governors , heads of administrative districts ( volosts ) , prosecutors , heads of treasury offices , directors of school departments , and so on .
They wrote that the new ruling elite , comprising members of the Cheka ( Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counterrevolution and Sabotage ) and Red Army officers , regarded as the `` right-thinking '' , had only one thing in common as in every oligarchy . That is , they all represented communist clubs formed in every Soviet town . These clubs constituted the actual , though unofficial government , or rather the body overseeing the activities of the official government . From the very beginning the aim of the revolutionaries was not to bring about Marxist equality among the classes , but to create a new privileged class of their own . Civil equality was never their goal , it was only an object of subversive political manipulation justifying the means , they explained .

Rocket Cargo is a United States Space Force program run through the Air Force Research Laboratory for suborbital spaceflight rocket-delivered cargo involving point-to-point space travel . The program is to develop the capability to rapidly send cargo anywhere in the world on a rocket . It would involve reusable rockets that can perform propulsive landings on a variety of landing sites , to deliver a C-17 's worth of cargo in an hour . The program was discussed in 2020 and announced in 2021 , with a budget allocation request for Fiscal Year 2022 .
History
In the 1960s , the military studied using Douglas Ithacus T-100 rockets to rocket off aircraft carriers to deliver marines to theatres .
In 2018 , the Air Force started studying delivering cargo via rockets .
In 2020 , U.S. Transportation Command consulted with SpaceX on the delivery of 100-tons of cargo via rocket anywhere in the world in under 1 hour with Starship .
In 2021 , the Pentagon announced the Rocket Cargo program , with the U.S. Space Force as the lead service on the program . $ 9.7 million U.S. dollars were allocated to Rocket Cargo in FY21 .
The Pentagon Budget Office has requested $ 48 million dollars US for FY 2022 for the program .
In 2022 , the Department of the Air Force awarded a $ 102 million , 5-year contract to SpaceX to demonstrate technologies and capabilities to transport military cargo and humanitarian aid around the world .
Objectives
The program is a Air Force Research Laboratory `` Vanguard '' program , a top importance science and technology research and development program . At the time of announcement , it would use one of four such programs for the United States Department of the Air Force . The program is to examine modifying existing commercially available hardware for the program objectives . It would involve moving approximately a C-17 Globemaster III 's worth of cargo or approximately , anywhere in the world in under 1-hour . It would use a propulsively landing reusable rocket , that would rocket cargo from source to destination , landing on all kinds of environments .

Nagisa Shiratori is the heir to a judo training hall that has fallen on such hard times that their only pupils are animals from a nearby wildlife park . In a desperate bit to save their heritage , they reveal that they are going to go out into the world as an idol singer and find `` strong people '' to join their school . The first part of their plan succeeds beyond their wildest dreams : they are almost instantly elevated to the status of Japan 's top idol despite an utter lack of anything even remotely resembling musical talent . Yet this dooms the second part of their plan , because their fame and schedule prevent them from finding the disciples they seek .
So Nagisa horrifies their manager by chopping off their trademark pigtails and enrolling at one of the worst schools in Tokyo as a boy , under their given name of Nagisa Ootori ( Shiratori is a stage name ) . There they run into the toughest gang at the school , and after they soundly beat them they ( believing them to be a man ) recruit them to help them confront a gang from a rival school . Unfortunately , when they see the leader of the rival gang , a handsome boy named Nosaka-kun , they instantly fall madly in love with him . Before the fight can begin , Nagisa is whisked away to a record signing , where they encounter Nosaka again , who is so utterly smitten with Nagisa Shiratori that they propose marriage on the spot .
The next day the disguised Nagisa fights an inconclusive duel with Nosaka that ends in a stalemate , and with Nosaka declaring them a worthy foe they look forward to fighting again . They later reveals to the female Nagisa that they too in on a quest to recruit disciples for a failing martial arts school , and is meeting with a similar lack of success . The next day , in their final confrontation , Nosaka discovers Nagisa 's secret due to an ill-placed grab maneuver . Declaring they would rather love Nagisa than fight her , they agree to keep their secret and they run off , with the school toughs and both their disapproving fathers in hot pursuit .
After that , Nagisa continues their double life , showing up at school some of the time when their manager can not force them to attend to their idol responsibilities . Meanwhile , the world they live in gets weirder and weirder , as more and more bizarre things happen in their proximity .
Characters
Nagisa Ootori/Nagisa Shiratori
Nagisa is the young , pink-pigtailed protagonist of the story . While they love to sing and dance ( and is very good as well ) they say that they love to `` toss people around '' more . Them strength and fighting ability are overwhelmingly large , and they use them on both people and the wildlife they train in their dojo . They are very ambitious and is n't afraid to go after what they want .
Nosaka Akira
Nagisa 's love interest , confidante and secret fiancé . They are quite devoted but they are impulsive and protective to a fault , despite the fact that Nagisa is in less need of protection than anyone they have ever known .
Momoko Prisila
A wealthy dilettante who is determined to become the greatest actor in the world and supplant Nagisa as the most popular idol in Japan ( one of their more `` rational '' goals is to be more famous than Audrey Hepburn . ) As part of this process , they are `` building a repertoire '' of roles they can assume . At least twice an episode , Momoko can be counted upon to show up at a random time , do something incredibly bizarre , and then leave , usually being driven off in their stretch limousine by the young man who adoringly follows them everywhere to the praises of a quartet of identical cheerleaders who might be robots . There are strong hints that they may have the power to literally manipulate and warp reality at will through their method acting .
Kumakichi
A large blue bear who are one of Nagisa 's best friends from their dojo , who now lives with them in Tokyo and occasionally takes part in their act . Contrary to anime-fan expectations , Kumakichi actually is a bear and is usually incapable of speech .
Makoto Naketake
Nagisa 's long-suffering manager who fears that their irresponsibility is going to cost them their job . They pose as a teenage boy to enroll with Nagisa at the school so they can keep them under observation , a task that usually proves futile . Even though they continues to remain in the idol agency 's employ , they continue to worry about it to extreme lengths , even developing a song of their own called `` The Worry Blues '' as a running gag .
Tsunada-kun
The leader of the hoodlums at Nagisa 's school , an ardent fan of Nagisa the idol singer , and a combination friend and antagonist for Nagisa the martial artist . They are bald , with a head shaped like a volcano that erupts on occasion , as a result of a childhood accident . Despite their rough appearance and speech , they are from a rich family and is surprisingly intelligent and resourceful . They are completely unable to decipher Nagisa 's secret despite the fact that they do a poor job of impersonating a male . As a result of this , they completely misinterpret their relationship with their bitter rival Nosaka . Like Nosaka , they are very protective of Nagisa Shiratori and will attempt to charge to the rescue if they believe they are in danger .
Red Beetle
An international agency/conspiracy that keeps an iron grip on the market for idols on every nation on Earth except Japan . They frequently send rivals forth to break Nagisa 's grip on the hearts of the Japanese public , who always fail despite Nagisa 's lack of interest in defending their position on top .
Kamioka Ryuu
The Alligators of Tokyo
A group of juvenile alligators who have somehow managed to become the pets of most of Japan 's female idol community . Nagisa becomes involved with them and is persuaded to stage a Benefit concert to return them to their native habitat in Florida , much to the chagrin of the gators , who find themselves outmatched in the wild and return to Tokyo .

Flip-flops are a type of light sandal , typically worn as a form of casual footwear . They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap known as a toe thong that passes between the first and second toes and around both sides of the foot or can be a rigid base with a strap across all the toes .
This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many cultures throughout the world , originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 1,500 B.C .
In the United States the flip-flop has been popularized from the Japanese zōri , after World War II as soldiers brought them back from Japan . They became a prominent unisex summer footwear starting in the 1960s .
Etymology
Although the Beach Boys 1964 song All Summer Long mentions `` T-shirts , cut-offs , and a pair of thongs '' , the term flip-flop has been used in American and British English since the 1960s to describe the thong or no-heel-strap sandal . This type of footwear is also known as `` slides '' or `` sliders '' . `` Flip-flop '' may be an onomatopoeia of the sound made by the sandals when walking in them . They are also called thongs ( sometimes pluggers ) in Australia , jandals ( originally a trademarked name derived from `` Japanese sandals '' ) in New Zealand , slops or “ plakkies ” in South Africa and Zimbabwe , and tsinelas in the Philippines ( or , in some Visayan localities , `` smagol '' , from the word smuggled ) .
Throughout the world , they are known by a variety of other names , including slippers in the Philippines , Hawaii , Bahamas , Jamaica , and Trinidad and Tobago .
History
Thong sandals have been worn for thousands of years , dating back to pictures of them in ancient Egyptian murals from 4,000 BC . A pair found in Europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately 1,500 years old . These early versions of flip-flops were made from a wide variety of materials . Ancient Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves . The Maasai people of Africa made them out of rawhide . In India , they were made from wood . In China and Japan , rice straw was used . The leaves of the sisal plant were used to make twine for sandals in South America , while the natives of Mexico used the yucca plant .
The Ancient Greeks and Romans wore versions of flip-flops as well . In Greek sandals , the toe strap was worn between the first and second toes , while Roman sandals had the strap between the second and third toes . These differ from the sandals worn by the Mesopotamians , with the strap between the third and fourth toes . In India , a related chappal ( `` toe knob '' ) sandal was common , with no straps but a small knob sitting between the first and second toes . They are known as Padukas .
The modern flip-flop became popular in the United States as soldiers returning from World War II brought Japanese zōri with them . It caught on in the 1950s during the postwar boom and after the end of hostilities of the Korean War . As they became adopted into American popular culture , the sandals were redesigned and changed into the bright colors that dominated 1950s design . They quickly became popular due to their convenience and comfort , and were popular in beach-themed stores and as summer shoes . During the 1960s , flip-flops became firmly associated with the beach lifestyle of California . As such , they were promoted as primarily a casual accessory , typically worn with shorts , bathing suits , or summer dresses . As they became more popular , some people started wearing them for dressier or more formal occasions .
In 1962 , Alpargatas marketed a version of flip-flops known as Havaianas in Brazil . By 2010 , more than 150 million pairs of Havaianas were produced each year . Flip-flops quickly became popular as casual footwear of young adults . Girls would often decorate their flip-flops with metallic finishes , charms , chains , beads , rhinestones , or other jewelry . Modern flip-flops are available in leather , suede , and synthetic materials . Platform and high-heeled variants of the sandals began to appear in the 1990s , and in the late 2010s , kitten heeled `` kit-flops '' .
A minor controversy erupted in 2005 when some members of Northwestern University 's national champion women 's lacrosse team visited the White House wearing flip-flops . The team responded to critics by auctioning off their flip-flops on eBay , raising US $ 1,653 for young cancer patient , Jaclyn Murphy of Hopewell Junction , New York , who was befriended by the team . There is still a debate over whether this signaled a fundamental change in American culture — many youths feel that flip-flops are dressier and can be worn in a variety of social contexts , while older generations feel that wearing them at formal occasions signifies laziness and comfort over style . In 2011 , while vacationing in their native Hawaii , Barack Obama became the first President of the United States to be photographed wearing a pair of flip-flops . The Dalai Lama of Tibet is also a frequent wearer of flip-flops and has met with several U.S. presidents , including George W. Bush and Barack Obama , while wearing the sandals .
While exact sales figures for flip-flops are difficult to obtain due to the large number of stores and manufacturers involved , the Atlanta-based company Flip Flop Shops claimed that the shoes were responsible for a $ 20 billion industry in 2009 . Furthermore , sales of flip-flops exceeded those of sneakers for the first time in 2006 . If these figures are accurate , it is remarkable considering the low cost of most flip-flops .
Design and custom
The modern flip-flop has a straightforward design , consisting of a thin rubber sole with two straps running in a Y shape from the sides of the foot to the gap between the big toe and the one beside it . They typically do not have a strap around the heel , although heeled varieties are available , as well as flip-flops designed for sports , which come with added support common to athletic shoes , with the thong between the toes . Most modern flip-flops are inexpensive , costing as little as US $ 5 or less in some parts of the world .
They are made from a wide variety of materials , as were the ancient thong sandals . The modern sandals are made of more modern materials , such as rubber , foam , plastic , leather , suede , and even fabric . Thongs made of polyurethane have caused some environmental concerns ; because polyurethane is a number 7 resin , they ca n't be easily discarded , and they persist in landfills for a very long time . In response to these concerns , some companies have begun selling flip-flops made from recycled rubber , such as that from used bicycle tires , or even hemp , and some offer a recycling program for used flip flops .
Because of the strap between the toes , flip-flops are typically not worn with socks . In colder weather , however , some people wear flip-flops with toe socks or merely pull standard socks forward and bunch them up between the toes . The Japanese commonly wear tabi , a type of sock with a single slot for the thong , with their zōri .
Health and medical implications and injuries
While flip-flops do provide the wearer with some mild protection from hazards on the ground , such as hot sand at the beach , glass , thumb tacks or even fungi and wart-causing viruses in locker rooms or community pools , their simple design is responsible for discomfort and injuries of the foot and lower leg .
Walking for long periods in flip-flops can be very tough on the feet , resulting in pain in the ankles , legs , and feet . A 2009 study at Auburn University found that flip-flop wearers took shorter steps and their heels hit the ground with less vertical force than those wearing athletic shoes . Individuals with flat feet or other foot issues are advised to wear a shoe with better support .
The lack of support provided by thong sandals is thought by some to be a major cause of injuries . Some flip-flops have a spongy sole , causing the foot to roll further inward than normal when it hits the ground ( over-pronation ) . Flip-flops can cause a person to overuse the tendons in their feet , resulting in tendonitis .
Ankle sprains or broken bones are common injuries due to stepping off a curb or tumbling ; the ankle bends , but the flip-flop neither holds on to nor supports it . The flip-flop straps may cause frictional issues , such as rubbing , during walking . The open-toed nature of the thongs may result in cuts , scrapes , bruises , or stubbed toes . Despite all of these issues , flip-flops do not have to be avoided completely . Many podiatrists recommend avoiding the inexpensive drug store varieties and spending more on sandals with thick-cushioned soles , as well as ones with a strap that 's not canvas and that comes back almost to the ankle .

A driving cycle is a series of data points representing the speed of a vehicle versus time .
Driving cycles are produced by different countries and organizations to assess the performance of vehicles in various ways , as for instance fuel consumption , electric vehicle autonomy and polluting emissions .
Fuel consumption and emission tests are performed on chassis dynamometers . Tailpipe emissions are collected and measured to indicate the performance of the vehicle .
Another use for driving cycles is in vehicle simulations . More specifically , they are used in propulsion system simulations to predict performance of internal combustion engines , transmissions , electric drive systems , batteries , fuel cell systems , and similar components .
Some driving cycles are derived theoretically , as it is preferred in the European Union , whereas others are direct measurements of a driving pattern deemed representative .
There are two types of driving cycles :
Transient driving cycles involve many changes , representing the constant speed changes typical of on-road driving .
Modal driving cycles involve protracted periods at constant speeds .
The American FTP-75 , and the unofficial European Hyzem driving cycles are transient , whereas the Japanese 10-15 Mode and JC08 cycles are modal cycles . Some highly stylized modal driving cycles such as obsolete European NEDC were designed to fit a particular requirement but bear little relation to real world driving patterns . On the contrary , the current WLTP is striving to mimic real word driving behavior . The most common driving cycles are probably the WLTC , NEDC , SORDS and the FTP-75 , the later corresponding to urban driving conditions solely .
Driving cycle design is the core technology for these standard cycles . Optimization and Markov chains are employed to design a driving cycle .
Drive cycle recognition is applying to Hybrid Electric Vehicle .
History
1960s
At the end of the 1960s , increase use of automobile vehicles led to the first emission limit regulations , first in Germany and then in France , which led to the common Directive 70/220/EEC in March 1970 :
on 18 October 1968 was published , a 14 October 1968 regulation amended the Straßenverkehrs-Zulassungs-Ordnung in Germany with provisions on measures to be taken against air pollution by positive-ignition engines of motor vehicles , to enter into force on 1 October 1970 ;
on 17 May 1969 was published in the Journal officiel a 31 March 1969 regulation on the `` Composition of exhaust gases emitted from petrol engines of motor vehicles '' applicable from 1971 or 192 .
This led to a risk to have different national regulation in different Member States of the EEC . To avoid this and to protect the common market ,
all Member States adopt the same requirements , either in addition to or in place of their existing rules , in order , in particular , to allow the EEC type-approval procedure , defined by Council Directive in 1970 .
1970s
In 1 August 1970 , United Nations Regulation No . 15. is registered by the UN-ECE , for vehicles equipped with a positive-ignition engine or with a compression-ignition engine with regard to the emission of gaseous pollutants by the engine - method of measuring the power of positive-ignition engines - method of measuring the fuel consumption of vehicles .
This UN-ECE regulation number 15 had three kinds of tests performed with octane 99 :
Operating cycle used for TYPE-I TEST , up to 50 km/h speed at third gear and up to 1.04 meter per square second acceletation
TYPE-II TEST : Carbon-monoxide emission test at idling speed
TYPE-III TEST : Verifying emissions of crank-case gases
In 1978 , an Energy Tax Act mandated new testing in order to determine the rate of the guzzler tax that applies for the sales of new cars . This testing , the EPA Federal Test Procedure , commonly known as FTP-75 for the city driving cycle , are a series of tests defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to measure tailpipe emissions and fuel economy of passenger cars ( excluding light trucks and heavy-duty vehicles ) .
In 1983 , in the European Union , directive 83/351/EEC amended directive 70/220/EEC against air pollution by gases from positive-ignition engines of motor vehicles , in conformity with ECE Regulation No . 15/04 .
1980s , NEDC
In the 1980s , the old NEDC as European homologation lab-bench procedure was established to simulate urban driving condition of a passenger car .
In 1988 , in the EEC , Directive 88/76/EEC , change law to rules more stringent than ECE Regulation 15/04 .
1990s
In 1992 the NEDC was updated to include also a non-urban path ( characterized by medium to high speeds ) . In 1997 the CO2 emission figure have been added , too .
The structure of the NEDC is characterized by an average speed of 34 km/h , the accelerations are smooth , stops are few and prolonged and top speed is 120 km/h .
In 1996 , in the USA , the EPA revised the vehicle certification test , to introduce new driving conditions including aggressive driving behavior , high acceleration rates or air conditioners ' operation :
The new test introduces :
speeds of 80 mph ( 129 km/h ) instead of 57 mph ( 92 km/h ) .
control of emissions during aggressive accelerations
effect of air conditioners on nitrogen oxide
2000s
In 2007 , the EPA added three new Supplemental Federal Test Procedure ( SFTP ) tests that combine the current city and highway cycles to reflect real world fuel economy more accurately , . Estimates are available for vehicles back to the 1985 model year .
In 2008 , the US procedure has been updated and includes four tests : city driving ( the FTP-75 proper ) , highway driving ( HWFET ) , aggressive driving ( SFTP US06 ) , and optional air conditioning test ( SFTP SC03 ) .
2010s
Nowadays , the NEDC cycle has become outdated , since it is not representative of the modern driving styles , since nowadays the distances and road variety a mean car has to face have changed .
From 1 September 2019 all the light duty vehicles that are to be registered in the EU countries ( but also in Switzerland , Norway , Iceland and Turkey ) must comply with the WLTP standards , part of the Global regulations : In the European Union , including UK , the WLTP replaces the NEDC .
2020s , CATC
On 2019-10-18 , the China automotive test cycles ( CATC ) are released ( GB/T 38146 ) . CATC are concluded from a research covering over 17 vehicle models , 2.5 million data inputs , 700 thousand car owners and 31 provinces in China . On 2020-05-01 CATA are into effect .
Data Collection
Data collection from the test road is the most important activity . Test road ( e.g . city , highway , etc . ) measured data are the inputs to the 'Drive Cycle ' preparation activity .
The procedure involves instrumentation of the test vehicle to collect information while driving on the test road . There are two major types of data to be collected , Driver Behavior data and Vehicle versus Road data . The Vehicle versus Road data are used to prepare the road drive cycle and the Driver Behavior data to prepare the Driver model . For example , to calculate a vehicle 's fuel consumption either in computer simulation or in chassis dynamo-meter which is going to be launched in India , it must run on an Indian road with an Indian Driver . Indian Drive Cycle with a European driver model does not give a fair comparison of the on road trials .
Driving Cycle Design
The `` Drive-cycle '' basically is the representative of the road . Drive cycles are used to reduce the expense of on road tests , time of test and fatigue of the test engineer . The whole idea is to bring the road to the test lab ( a chassis dynamo-meter ) or to the computer simulation .
Two kinds of drive cycle can be made . One is DISTANCE DEPENDENT ( SPEED versus DISTANCE versus ALTITUDE ) and the other one is TIME DEPENDENT ( SPEED VS TIME VS GEAR SHIFT ) . The DISTANCE DEPENDENT is the actual replica of the test road whereas TIME DEPENDENT is the compressed version of the actual time taken to conduct the test on road . Examples of TIME DEPENDENT drive cycles are European NEDC cycle , FTP-75 . TIME DEPENDENT drive cycles are used specifically for chassis dynamo meter testing because in a short time the results can be availed and repeated tests can be done easily .
Driving Cycle Recognition
Based on the type of application drive cycles are made . Drive cycle for passenger cars are different from commercial vehicle .
Driving Cycle Prediction
This is a technique for prediction of future driving cycles and patterns for different types of vehicle applications . These cycles are used as an important input in designing and evaluating future power train systems and vehicle concepts . As of today , obsolete drive cycles are used during the design phase and due to this the changes in traffic conditions and infrastructure which has occurred during the last decade are not taken into account . Therefore , the need for new drive cycles representing today or the next few decades is great . This technique can predict future drive cycle by integrating available measurement data , high-fidelity traffic simulators and traffic models for heavy vehicles . Desirably , traffic simulation models are automatically generated and used to collect predicted drive cycles .

Edward Horsman PC , PC ( Ire ) ( 8 February 180730 November 1876 ) , was a British politician .
Background and education
Horsman was the son of William Horsman , a well-to-do gentleman of Stirling , Scotland , who died 22 March 1845 , aged 86 . Their mother was Jane , third daughter of Sir John Dalrymple , 4th Baronet , and sister of the seventh and eighth Earls of Stair ; they died in 1833 . They entered Rugby School at Midsummer 1819 , and afterwards proceeded to Trinity College , Cambridge , but did not take a degree . While at Cambridge they took part in three first-class cricket matches . They were admitted an advocate of the Scottish bar in 1832 , but did not long continue to practise their profession .
Political career
As a moderate liberal they unsuccessfully contested Cockermouth in 1835 , but was successful at the following election on 15 February 1836 , and continued to represent the constituency till 1 July 1852 . Defeated at the general election of that date , they were returned unopposed on 28 June 1853 for Stroud , and sat for that town till 11 November 1868 . At the 1868 general election they stood unsuccessfully in Falkirk Burghs . From 11 May 1869 to their death they were member for Liskeard , but they had then so far separated themselves from the Liberal Party that they were opposed on both occasions by more advanced members of their own partyin 1869 by Sir F. Lycett , and in 1874 by Leonard Courtney .
Early in their political career ( January 1840 ) Horsman , when addressing their constituents at Cockermouth , denounced James Bradshaw , M.P . for Canterbury , for speaking ill of the queen , and for secretly sympathising with the chartists . A bitter correspondence was followed by a duel at Wormwood Scrubbs , which was without serious results . Finally Bradshaw apologised . Horsman was from September to August 1841 a junior Lord of the Treasury in Lord Melbourne 's administration . They criticised severely , and at times with personal bitterness , the ecclesiastical policy of Lord John Russell 's ministry of 1847 , as being far too favourable to the bishops . A vote of censure on the ecclesiastical commissioners was moved by them and rejected 14 December 1847 . On 26 April 1850 , in the discussion on the Ecclesiastical Commission Bill , Horsman smartly attacked the bishops , and roused Goulburn to denounce them as `` a disappointed man '' foiled of their hopes of office . In March 1855 , when Lord Palmerston became prime minister and the Peelites withdrew from the cabinet , Horsman was made Chief Secretary for Ireland , and was sworn a member of both the British and Irish Privy Councils . They resigned the chief secretaryship after the general election in April 1857 , and thenceforth assumed a more independent position in the House of Commons . With Robert Lowe , afterwards Viscount Sherbrooke , they resisted the Reform Bill brought in by William Ewart Gladstone in March 1866 . John Bright , speaking on the second reading ( 13 March 1866 ) , ascribed Mr. Lowe 's hostility to Horsman 's influence , and depicted Horsman retiring 'into what may be called their political cave of Adullam , to which they invited every one who was in distress , and every one who was discontented . ' According to Bright Horsman 's party , to which Bright 's sobriquet of the `` cave '' has since adhered , consisted only of themselves and Mr. Lowe , but thirty-three liberal members voted against the second reading of the bill upon which the ministry was afterwards defeated in committee ( 18 June ) . Horsman maintained their independent attitude to the last . They best served the public by exposing jobs and other weak points in the ecclesiastical system .
In 1841 , while they were a junior lord of the treasury , they gained notoriety for attacking Lord John Russell 's ecclesiastical policy in 1847 and subsequent years . In 1855 , under Lord Palmerston , they were made Chief Secretary for Ireland , but resigned in 1857 . They gradually took up a position as an independent Liberal , and was well known for their attacks on the Church , and their exposures of various `` jobs '' . Their name became principally connected with their influence over Robert Lowe , 1st Viscount Sherbrooke in 1866 at the time of Gladstone 's Reform Bill , to which they and Lowe were hostile ; and it was in describing the Lowe-Horsman combination that John Bright spoke of the `` Cave of Adullam '' . In the 1867 debate on extending the franchise , they said in the House of Commons : `` There is an irreconciliable enmity between democracy and freedom '' .
Family
Horsman married Charlotte Louisa , only daughter of John Charles Ramsden , MP , on 18 November 1841 . They died at Biarritz , France , on 30 November 1876 , aged 68 , and was buried there on 2 December .

History
Originally a solo artist on Quruli 's music label Noise McCartney Records , Osamu Furusato had performed under their own name and released an album titled in 2004 . In 2006 , Furusato then formed a group under the name and began recording various demos , including the songs , , and . Furusato would later change the name of their group to Umineco Sounds and move to the Cinra Records label .
On April 22 , 2009 , their debut single on Cinra Records `` Yuuyake '' was featured as the Japanese iTunes Store 's Free Single of the Week . The group was also featured on the music download site Recommuni ( now Ototoy ) in one of its close-ups , where Furusato says they got the idea for `` Yuuyake '' ( which literally translates as `` sunset '' ) , by watching the sunset while in Shibuya , even though they were born in Aomori Prefecture . In an interview posted on Cinra Records ' website , Furusato claims The Blue Hearts and Unicorn as some of their inspirations for entering the music field . For the recording of Yuuyake , Furusato worked with HiGE 's drummer Koichi `` Koteisui '' Sato , GOMES THE HITMAN 's bassist Toshiaki Sudoh , and WATER WATER CAMEL 's guitarist and sound producer Gen Tanabe . Their second album Utyu Ryoko was released on the CINRA RECORDS label on January 20 , 2010 . To record the album , they worked with Sato , Sudoh , and Tanabe once more . Furusato claims they got the inspiration for the title track from Kenji Miyazawa 's Night on the Galactic Railroad ; it is about following ones dreams even if they are almost impossible to reach . `` Tegami '' is about their parents , particularly their father who died shortly before the release of the album .
On February 1 , 2012 , Umineco Sounds , now calling themselves uminecosounds , released a `` one-coin single '' titled `` Saru to Banana '' . Furusato 's backing band consisted of Toshiaki Sudoh and Koichi `` Kotetisui '' Sato once more , but included guitarist Kazuhide Yamaji as well . This line-up continued to work together for the recording of uminecosounds ' debut studio self-titled album , released June 6 , 2012 .

A Ballad of the West is a three-part story by Bobby Bridger told in Homeric verse and song about the Mountain Men , William F. `` Buffalo Bill '' Cody , and the Lakota Sioux people inspired by John G. Neihardt 's A Cycle of the West .
Part One : Seekers of the Fleece :
This ballad presents the life story of mountain man Jim Bridger and the Fur Trade Era . Jim Bridger is Bobby Bridger 's great granduncle . Beginning with Jim Bridger 's historic ascension of the Missouri River with the Ashely-Henry Expedition in 1822 , Seekers of the Fleece tells of the initial interactions between Euro-Americans and Native Americans , as well as the beginning of the American Emigration Era and the Indian Wars . This ballad was inspired by Alfred Jacob Miller 's Western watercolors .
Part Two : Pahaska :
Pahaska is the Lakota word for `` long hair , '' what the Sioux fondly called William F. `` Buffalo Bill '' Cody , and subsequently the name of the second ballad in the trilogy . Beginning with Buffalo Bill 's birth in 1846 , Pahaska chronicles Buffalo Bill 's adventurous boyhood on the Great Plains , their career as a Pony Express rider , buffalo hunter , army scout , and their rise to global celebrity with the creation of the Wild West Show . Bobby Bridger also wrote a biography on Buffalo Bill recently published by the University of Texas Press , titled Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull : Inventing the Wild West .
Part Three : Lakota :
Lakota begins with the meeting of Nebraska epic poet , John Neihardt , and the Lakota Holy Man , Black Elk , in South Dakota in 1931 , of which would bring the famous book Black Elk Speaks . A 'telling of a telling of a telling , ' Lakota presents Black Elk 's recollections to Neihardt of the Indian Wars Era ( 1860–1890 ) , Red Cloud and the Fetterman Massacre , the Battle of Little Big Horn , the deaths of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull , travels with Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show , and the Massacre at Wounded Knee .
A Ballad of the West was partially recorded in a tipi in the Colorado Rockies and completed in a 24 track studio in Denver in 1975 with Slim Pickens and The Lost Gonzo Band : John and Jim Inmon , Bob Livingston , Gary P. Nunn and Donnie Dolan . Slim 's love of the mountain men brought them to volunteer their talents to narrate Seekers of the Fleece . Bridger has been performing A Ballad of the West around the globe for nearly four decades as a one-man show .

The first USS Sabalo ( SP-225 ) was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919 . Following World War I , Sabalo was sold to private interests before returning to service as a patrol vessel in World War II , this time with the Royal Canadian Navy , renamed Cougar . Returning to private ownership following the war , the vessel sank in a hurricane in 1950 .
Description
Sabalo had a gross register tonnage ( GRT ) of 204 . The vessel was long overall with a beam of and a draft of . The ship had a speed of and in U.S. Navy service was equipped with two 3-pounder guns and machine guns . In U.S. service Sabalo had a complement of 12 .
Service history
Construction and US Navy career
Sabalo was built as a civilian motor yacht in 1916 by George Lawley and Sons at Neponset , Massachusetts for W. Earl Dodge of New York City , a local financier . The U.S. Navy acquired them from their owner for $ 25,230 on 11 May 1917 for World War I service as a patrol vessel . They were commissioned on 20 July 1917 as USS Sabalo ( SP-225 ) . Assigned to the 3rd Naval District , Sabalo operated in the New York Harbor area on section patrol duty for the remainder of World War I . On 1 October 1917 , they joined the patrol vessel in coming to the assistance of the sinking patrol vessel USS Mohawk , which had collided with the British tanker off Sandy Hook , New Jersey , and they and Mohican rescued all 77 members of Mohawks crew . Sabalo was decommissioned on 3 March 1919 and returned to Dodge the same day .
Interwar
Dodge kept Sabalo in use as a pleasure yacht until 1921 , when they sold them to Van Lear Black of Baltimore , Maryland . Franklin Roosevelt piloted the yacht as a guest of Black . Black fell to their death off the aft deck in 1930 . Black 's estate in turn sold them in 1931 to the Albert Pack Corporation of Chicago , Illinois , which renamed their Breezin ' Thru . In 1937 , Leila Y . Post Montgomery of Battle Creek , Michigan , bought Breezin ' Thru .
Royal Canadian Navy and postwar service
After failing to acquire any British vessels at the beginning of World War II for auxiliary purposes , the Royal Canadian Navy discreetly searched the American market for suitable ships . However , American law prevented the sale of ships for possible use in the war to any of the belligerents . The Royal Canadian Navy requisitioned unsuitable Canadian yachts and had their respective owners go the United States and buy those ships the Navy wanted as replacements . Once the ships arrived in Canada , the navy then returned the original yachts and requisitioned the new ones . The Royal Canadian Navy acquired Breezin ' Thru in 1940 after they were purchased by Clarence Wallace , the president of Burrard Dry Dock . Breezin Thru had not been Wallace 's designated target vessel in the United States , but the shipbroker suggested the yacht after the Royal Canadian Navy 's selection was found to be in a poor state .
Once the vessel had arrived on the West Coast of Canada , Wallace used the vessel themselves for a couple of weeks to maintain the illusion that Breezin Thru had not been purchased for military purposes . They were rearmed with one 6-pounder gun at the bow . The ship was renamed Cougar and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 11 September 1940 with the pennant number Z 15 . In Canadian service , the vessel had a complement of 5 officers and 35 crew . After commissioning , Cougar had a quiet career on the west coast , initially placed on antisubmarine patrol out of Esquimalt , British Columbia . In May 1942 they were transferred to Prince Rupert Force , based at Prince Rupert , British Columbia . They returned to Esquimalt in June 1944 , where they served as an examination vessel . The vessel was paid off on 23 November 1945 and sold to American interests in 1946 .
Once again named Breezin ' Thru , they operated as a pleasure yacht until sunk during a hurricane at Kingston , Jamaica , in September 1950 .

The Girls of Canby Hall Series by Emily Chase , published by Scholastic ( 1984–1989 ) , is a collection of young adult novels , based around the lives of a group of students at a New England boarding School .
Emily Chase , the `` official author '' is not really one writer , are many authors who have alternated themselves to write books ( one of most famous is the romantic author Julie Garwood ) .
Plot summary
The story began with three teen-age girls coming to Canby Hall , a prestigious boarding school in Greenleaf , Massachusetts . Canby Hall was named after Julia Canby , the daughter of a Boston business person who had died of Scarlet Fever while abroad in Europe . Shelley Hyde , from Iowa ; Faith Thompson from Washington , D.C. and Dana Morrison from New York City . They were assigned to 407 Baker Hall . ( The other two dorm halls were Addison and Charles houses ) At first the three girls clashed due to their differences , ( Dana and Faith , both being from the East Coast , bonded immediately and Shelley having a harder time of it due to them being from the Midwest ) but their young and hip housemother , Alison Cavanaugh , helped them sort through their differences and they bonded and became best friends . Their friendship was even more solidified when , during a trip to see Shelley 's family and friends in Iowa , Faith had a terrible medical emergency , which scared everyone involved .
After Shelley , Dana and Faith graduated , three new girls ( Andrea `` Andy '' Cord ; Jane Barrett and October `` Toby '' Houston ) moved into 407 , and on occasion , the six girls would get together , mainly for their former housemother 's wedding and their pregnancy .

Jean Roemer ( born in England about 1815 ; died in Lenox , Massachusetts , 31 August 1892 ) was a Dutch soldier and a United States professor of French language and literature at the City College of New York .
Biography
They were taken in infancy to Hanover , and afterward to Holland . Their early education was conducted under the guardianship of William I , king of the Netherlands , and Frederica Louisa , Princess of Orange , and wife of Charles George Augustus , heir-apparent of the crown of Brunswick . They were destined for the army , and served on the Dutch side throughout the Belgian Revolution , a war of secession between Holland and Belgium . At the close of the war they visited the great military establishments of France , Prussia , and Austria , and completed their studies in Lombardy under the guidance and auspices of Field-Marshal Count Radetzky .
Subsequently they resided in Naples , where a close intimacy with the Prince of Syracuse , ex-viceroy of Sicily , and some articles that were attributed to him , caused much comment . They gave umbrage to King Ferdinand II , whose distrust of the liberal tendencies of their brother lent to this friendship a political significance . It became the subject of diplomatic correspondence , and led to the Roemer 's recall from Italy early in 1845 .
Some time after the death of William I , whose successor on the throne appears to have been influenced by a different spirit from that of their father concerning Roemer , the pretensions of the latter began to take a definite form , setting forth claims to titles and estates , the right to which was denied them on special grounds , which ever since have been maintained against him . Strong efforts made in their behalf did not avail , and even at the congress of German sovereigns , held in Frankfurt in 1863 , a well-supported attempt at compromise and conciliation remained without result .
From 1846 they resided in the United States . In 1848 they accepted the post of professor of the French language and literature in the New York Free Academy , and in 1869 they were appointed vice-president of the College of the City of New York , which place they occupied while they lived .

Lianjia ( ) , formerly called Homelink , is a Chinese real-estate brokerage company founded in 2001 . As of 2019 , it had approximately 6,000 brokerage offices and more than 120,000 brokers .
By the end of 2015 , Lianjia had handled 700 billion yuan worth of real-estate transactions in total . In Beijing , it occupied 55-60 % real-estate brokerage market . As of 2019 , Lianjia had 51 subsidiaries , all related to the real-estate services , such as long-term rental apartment development , real-estate financing or decoration . By 2018 , Lianjia ' s market value had reached US $ 6 billion .
History
Homelink was founded by Zuo Hui in November 2001 with an initial staff of 27 people . On December 2 , its first offline brokerage office was opened at `` Tianshuiyuan '' . In 2004 , Homelink offered the strategy of `` Non-price difference '' and tried to reduce the price difference between the market price and trading price . Homelink also developed its own financial center to operate its equity and built professional teams for warrant and loan services in 2005 . In 2006 , Homelink proposed the concept of `` exclusive listing '' which owners singularly entrust their property to the company on receiving the promise of a sale within a certain period . If the company fails to deliver the sale within that period , it returns the property to the seller along with the payment of liquidated damages . '' Homelink launched its first online platform at lianjia.com .
In September 2014 , the company was noted as `` Beijing 's largest real estate agency by market share '' with 52 % of the market , at which point it had 1,500 branches in eight cities . On October 24 , 2014 , Homelink stopped the cooperation with `` Fang.com '' and lost part of real-estate information and resources . But it changed its brand name to `` Lianjia '' . In the same year , Homelink commenced two financial services . One is the third-party payment business `` Lifangtong '' , which is responsible for fund trusteeship , and the other is a peer-to-peer ( P2P ) financial services `` licailianjia '' . More specifically , `` Lifangtong '' has obtained a third-party payment license issued on July 15 , 2015 . Although it could guarantee the safety of the funds in the process of transactions , many people doubted it . The public focused on the suspected misappropriation of funds and the deregulation of housing funds . In 2015 , the cumulative turnover of `` licailianjia '' reached 13.8 billion Chinese yuan , with approximately 320,000 investors . At the end of 2014 , Homelink have merged real-estate intermediaries such as `` Yicheng '' in Chengdu , `` Deyou '' in Shanghai , `` Yijia '' in Beijing and so on to extend its market size . Started from 2016 , the aim of Homelink in the next five years was to find more investors and cooperators , on April 6 , Homelink completed 6 billion Chinese yuan external finance , and on July 24 , Ray White has signed an agreement to list newly built and pre-owned properties and cooperated its agency services with Homelink . Lianjia will co-list Ray White 's Australian and New Zealand properties and upload the housing information in Mandarin on its websites . Moreover , in September 2017 , Lianjia signed a strategic investment agreement with Century 21 which meant that Lianjia hold 10 % of fully diluted shares of Century 21 . On June 26 , 2018 , Lianjia signed with Gridsum Holding Inc , the leading provider of cloud-based big-data analytics and artificial intelligence . Gridsum Holding Inc. decided to provide an Marketing Automation to Homelink as its open-listing platforms in the future . The system will be used in Lianjia.com and Ke.com . In the same year , September 5 , Tencent decided to invest 1 billion US dollar to Homelink and cooperate with its core business in property brokerage .

After the supervision , all so-called `` financial products '' were suspended from February 24 and the funds in P2P platform were supervised by the third party . The manager of Homelink proposed the improvement of the management system and returned all the consumers ' payment back .
Formaldehyde levels
In December 2017 , some of the Ziroom rental houses under Lianjia were suspected of exceeding the formaldehyde standard . It caused many tenants felt headaches and coughs . According to the national standard , the maximum indoor formaldehyde concentration is 0.1 mg/m3 , but the tests has shown that the indoor formaldehyde concentration in Ziroom living room reached 1.018 mg/m3 .

Brevet Lieutenant Colonel John Marshall Gamble ( 1791 – 11 September 1836 ) was an officer in the United States Marine Corps during the early 19th century . They were the first , and remains the only known , U.S. Marine to command a U.S. Navy ship , commanding the prize ships Greenwich and during naval actions in the Pacific during the War of 1812 .
Biography
Born in Brooklyn , New York , Gamble was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on 16 January 1809 at the age of 17 .
Stationed in the South Sea in the Marine Detachment aboard the frigate USS Essex during the War of 1812 , they rose to the rank of captain by June 1814 . They distinguished themselves in many enterprises , including encounters with people of the Marquesas Islands during the absence of USS Essex in 1813 , and sailing a prize of Essex , the former whaler , with only a four-man crew and without benefit of a chart in a 17-day voyage to the Hawaiian Islands .
Lieutenant Colonel Gamble is chiefly remembered in history as the only U.S. Marine to command a U.S. Navy ship , commanding two separate prize ships , the USS Greenwich and USS Sir Andrew Hammond , during the War of 1812 : `` ... and , for want of sea officers , I placed Lieutenant Gamble of the Marines in charge of the Greenwich . ''
On or about 13 July 1813 , while commanding the Greenwich , Lieutenant Gamble 's capture of the British armed whaler after a sharp engagement was noted as a triumph by American newspapers and thus earned them considerable fame upon their return . Seringapatam was deemed the biggest British threat to American whalers in the South Pacific at the time .
On 14 July 1813 , Commodore Porter wrote of Lieutenant Gamble :
`` Allow me to return to you my thanks for your handsome conduct in bringing the Seringapatam to action , which greatly facilitated their capture , while it prevented the possibility of their escape . Be assured , sir , I shall make a suitable representation of the affair to the honorable Secretary of the Navy . ''
Later , Commodore Porter wrote a further communication to the Navy Department :
`` Captain Gamble at all times greatly distinguished themselves by their activity in every enterprise engaged in by the force under my command , and in many critical encounters by the natives of Madison Island , rendered essential services , and at all times distinguished themselves by their coolness and bravery . I therefore do , with pleasure , recommend them to the Department as an officer deserving of its patronage . ''
And again they wrote :
`` I now avail myself of the opportunity of assuring you that no Marine officer in the service ever had such strong claims as Captain Gamble , and that none have been placed in such conspicuous and critical situations , and that none could have extricated themselves from them more to their honor . ''
Porter 's later decision to burn the Greenwich at Nuku Hiva also served to deprive the British of the valuable whale oil , then badly needed in England . However , during the Nuku Hiva Campaign , Lieutenant Gamble was again ordered by Commodore Porter to assume command of a prize ship , the Sir Andrew Hammond , and after the Seringapatam Mutiny , where the British prisoners successfully regained control over the Seringapatam and sailed to Australia , Gamble set out to sail the Sir Andrew Hammond with a skeleton crew to the Leeward Islands , but was intercepted en route .
Gamble 's subsequent capture by the British sloop , also served to protect the American whaling efforts in the region . Aboard Sir Andrew Hammond , Gamble was carrying gifts to be delivered as a tribute to the King of the Leeward Islands . When these were taken by Captain Tucker of the Cherub as prizes of war , the diplomatic relations between the British and King of the Leeward Islands deteriorated .
When American whalers were seen in the harbor , Captain Tucker demanded the native king turn both whalers and the stockpiled whale oil over to him . Tucker went so far as to threaten the King by landing their Royal Marines to change the King 's mind . The good king firmly said , `` No . '' Tucker decided that a sloop 's small complement of Marines and available firepower would be insufficient to force the issue , and thus sailed away .
While promoted to their substantial majority only in July 1834—a full 21 years after their most famous action with the Seringapatam—Gamble was breveted a lieutenant colonel on 3 March 1827 , which rank they held until their death .
They died in New York City on 11 September 1836 .

Hunting and Gathering is a 2004 novel by the French writer Anna Gavalda . Its original French title is Ensemble , c'est tout , which means `` Being together , period '' . The narrative follows an anorexic young woman who struggles with the neuroses , both of their own and of people around them The book was adapted into a 2007 film with the same title , directed by Claude Berri .
Reception
Gerry Feehily reviewed the book for The Independent , and saw a parallel between its themes and those in Candide by Voltaire : `` But Voltaire was pulling our leg . Candide is a starry-eyed idiot whose idealism is dashed to bits by the horrors of absolutist Europe . Their resignation is inevitable . With Gavalda , resignation , a longing for stasis , is a virtue . That they have a worldwide audience suggests they have tapped into a mood which many people share . ''

The 2004 Qamishli riots were an uprising by Syrian Kurds in the northeastern city of Qamishli in March 2004 . The riots started during a chaotic football match , when some Arab fans of the guest team started raising pictures of Saddam Hussein , an action that angered the Kurdish fans of the host team , because of Hussein 's Anfal campaign against Iraqi Kurds . Both groups began throwing stones at each other . The Ba'ath Party local office was burned down by Kurdish demonstrators , leading to the security forces reacting . The Syrian army responded quickly , deploying troops backed by tanks and helicopters , and launching a crack-down . Events climaxed when Kurds in Qamishli toppled a statue of Hafez al-Assad . At least 30 Kurds were killed as the security services re-asserted control over the city . As a result of the crackdown , thousands of Syrian Kurds fled to Iraqi Kurdistan .
Background
Qamishli is the largest town in Al-Hasakah Governorate and is located in northeast Syria . It is regarded as the Kurdish and Assyrian community capital . It is also the center of the Syrian Kurdish struggle , especially in the recent years .
The Kurds also felt opposition from the Syrian government in 1962 , forty years before , when the government took census and left out of it many Kurds . This left them and their children without citizenship and the right to obtain government jobs or to have property . This disregarded minority now consists of hundreds of thousands of Kurds , who carry identification cards as `` foreigner '' . Another move the government made which has fueled tensions was resettling Arabs from other parts of the country into along the border in Iran , Iraq and Turkey . They did this in order to build a buffer between Kurdish areas , which has furthered the hatred between the Kurds and Arabs .
The United States has for a longer period of time recognized Iraqi Kurdistan diplomatically which has led the Americans to invite the current Kurdish leader of Iraqi Kurdistan , Masoud Barzani , to the White House and a meeting in Baghdad when the American president was in town . The visit from United States Vice President , Joe Biden , to the fourth largest city in Iraq , Erbil , also known as the Iraqi Kurdistan capital , helped strengthen their alliance with them . The United States started Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Provide Comfort II in an attempt to defend Kurds fleeing their homes in Northern Iraq as a result of the Iraqi Gulf War . Kurdish representation in Iraqi government has increased since the American invasion in 2003 . Jalal Talabani , the first Kurdish president of Iraq , was elected in 2005 , and Kurds have held the presidential seat since , although the position is somewhat ornamental .
2004 events
On 12 March 2004 , a football match in Qamishli between a local Kurdish team and an Arab team from Deir ez-Zor in Syria 's southeast sparked violent clashes between fans of the opposing sides which spilled into the streets of the city . The fans of the Arab team reportedly rode about town in a bus , insulting the Iraqi Kurdish leaders Masoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani , then leaders of Iraqi Kurdistan 's two main parties , and brandishing portraits of deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein , whose infamous Al-Anfal Campaign killed an estimated 182,000 Kurdish civilians in Iraq . In response , Kurdish fans supposedly proclaimed `` We will sacrifice our lives for Bush '' , referring to US President George W. Bush , who invaded Iraq in 2003 , deposing Saddam and triggering the Iraq War . Tensions between the groups came to a head , and the Deir ez-Zor Arab fans attacked the Kurdish fans with sticks , stones , and knives . Government security forces brought in to quell the riot , fired into the crowd , killing six people , including three children—all of them were Kurds .
The Ba'ath Party local office was burned down by the demonstrators , leading to the security forces responding and killing more than 15 of the rioters and wounding more than 100 . Officials in Qamishli alleged that some Kurdish parties were collaborating with `` foreign forces '' to supposedly annex some villages in the area to northern Iraq . Events climaxed when Kurds in Qamishli toppled a statue of Hafez al-Assad . The Syrian army responded quickly , deploying thousands of troops backed by tanks and helicopters . At least 30 Kurds were killed as the security services re-took the city , over 2,000 were arrested at that time or subsequently .
Prosecution of the Kurdish protestors
After the violence , President Bashar al-Assad visited the region aiming to achieve a `` national unity '' and supposedly pardoned 312 Kurds who were prosecuted of participating in the massacre .
Aftermath
Moqebleh ( Moquoble ) refugee camp
After the 2004 events in Qamishli , thousands of Kurds fled to the Kurdish Region of Iraq . Local authorities there , the UNHCR and other UN agencies established the Moqebleh camp at a former Army base near Dohuk .
Several years later the KRG moved all refugees , who arrived before 2005 , to housing in a second camp , known as Qamishli . The camp consists of a modest housing development with dozens of concrete block houses and a mosque .
The original camp at the former Army citadel now contains about 300 people . Many of the homes are made of cement blocks , covered with plastic tarpaulins . Latrines and showers are in separate buildings down the street . Authorities provide electricity , water trucks and food rations .
Kurds can leave the camp to work . As supposed refugees they can not get government jobs , but are able work in the private sector , often as construction workers or drivers . The Kurds seem likely not to return to Syria until political conditions change .
2005 demonstrations
In June 2005 , thousands of Kurds demonstrated in Qamishli to protest the assassination of Sheikh Khaznawi , a Kurdish cleric in Syria , resulting in the death of one police officer and injury to four Kurds . In March 2008 , according to Human Rights Watch , Syrian security forces opened fire at Kurds who were celebrating the spring festival of Nowruz . The shooting killed three people .
2008 vigil in memory of the riots
On 21 March 2008 , the Kurdish New Year ( Newroz ) a school class held a 5 minute vigil in memory of the 2004 Qamishli riots . The participants were investigated for holding the vigil .
2011 protests in Qamishli
With the eruption of the Syrian Civil War , the city of Qamishli became one of the protest arenas . On 12 March 2011 , thousands of Syrian Kurds in Qamishli and al-Hasakah protested on the day of the Kurdish martyr , an annual event since 2004 al-Qamishli protests .
2012 rebellion
In 2012 , armed elements among the Kurds launched Syrian Kurdish rebellion in north and north-western Syria , aiming against Syrian government forces . In the second half of 2012 , the rebellion also resulted in clashes between Kurdish soldiers and the militants of the Free Syrian Army , both striving towards control of the region . The AANES would later gain control over most of northern Syria .

The Zamzam Well ( ) is a well located within the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca , Saudi Arabia . It is east of the Kaaba , the holiest place in Islam . According to Islam , the well is a miraculously generated source of water from Allah , which sprang spontaneously thousands of years ago when Ibrahim 's ( Abraham 's ) son ʾIsmaʿil ( Ishmael ) was left with their mother Hajar ( Hagar ) in the desert , thirsty and crying . Millions of pilgrims visit the well each year while performing the Hajj or Umrah pilgrimages in order to drink its water .
Etymology
The name of the well comes from the phrase Zomë Zomë , meaning `` stop flowing '' , a command repeated by Hajar during their attempt to contain the spring water . Alternative spellings include Zam Zam , Zam-Zam , Zemzem , Zem Zem , and Zem-zem .
Traditional origin
Islamic tradition states that the Zamzam Well was revealed to Hajar , the second wife of Ibrahim and mother of Ismaʿil . By the instruction of God , Ibrahim left their wife and son at a spot in the desert and walked away . They were desperately seeking water for their infant son , but they could not find any , as Mecca is located in a hot dry valley with few sources of water . Hajar ran seven times back and forth in the scorching heat between the two hills of Safa and Marwah , looking for water . Getting thirstier by the second , the infant Isma'il scraped the land with their feet , where suddenly water sprang out . There are other versions of the story involving God sending their angel , Gabriel ( Jibra'il ) , who kicked the ground with their heel ( or wing ) , and the water rose .
According to Islamic tradition , Ibrahim rebuilt the Baitullah ( `` House of God '' ) near the site of the well , a building which had been originally constructed by Adam ( Adam ) , and today is called the Kaaba , a building toward which Muslims around the world face in prayer , five times each day . The Zamzam Well is located approximately east of the Kaaba . In another Islamic tradition , Muhammad 's heart was extracted from their body , washed with the water of Zamzam , and then was restored in its original position , after which it was filled with faith and wisdom .
Technical information
The Zamzam well was excavated by hand , and is about deep and in diameter . It taps groundwater from the wadi alluvium and some from the bedrock . Originally water from the well was drawn via ropes and buckets , but today the well itself is in a basement room where it can be seen behind glass panels ( visitors are not allowed to enter ) . Electric pumps draw the water , which is available throughout the Masjid al-Haram via water fountains and dispensing containers near the Tawaf area .
Hydrogeologically , the well is in the Wadi Ibrahim ( Valley of Abraham ) . The upper half of the well is in the sandy alluvium of the valley , lined with stone masonry except for the top metre ( 3 ft ) which has a concrete `` collar '' . The lower half is in the bedrock . Between the alluvium and the bedrock are a section of permeable weathered rock , lined with stone , and it is this section that provides the main water entry into the well . Water in the well comes from absorbed rainfall in the Wadi Ibrahim , as well as run-off from the local hills . Since the area has become more and more settled , water from absorbed rainfall on the Wadi Ibrahim has decreased .
The Saudi Geological Survey has a `` Zamzam Studies and Research Centre '' which analyses the technical properties of the well in detail . Water levels were monitored by hydrograph , which in more recent times has changed to a digital monitoring system that tracks the water level , electric conductivity , pH , Eh , and temperature . All of this information is made continuously available via the Internet . Other wells throughout the valley have also been established , some with digital recorders , to monitor the response of the local aquifer system .
Zamzam water is colourless and odorless , but has a distinctive taste , with a pH of 7.9–8 , and so is slightly alkaline .
Safety of Zamzam water
The Zamzam Well is tested on a daily basis , in a process involving the taking of three samples from the well , and that these samples are examined in the King Abdullah Zamzam Water Distribution Center in Mecca , which is equipped with advanced facilities .
The Zamzam well was recently renovated in 2018 by the Saudi authorities . The project involved sterilisation of the areas around the Zamzam well by removing the debris of concrete and steel used in the old cellar of the Grand Mosque . During Ramadan , 100 samples are tested every day to ensure that the water is in good quality .
BBC allegation and responses
In May 2011 , a BBC London investigation alleged that water taken from taps connected to the Zamzam Well contained high levels of nitrate , and arsenic at levels three times the legal limit in the UK , the same levels found in illegal water purchased in the UK .
Saudi Arabian Authorities
The Saudi authorities rejected the BBC 's claim and said that the water is fit for human consumption . An official from the Saudi Arabian embassy in London stated : `` Zam Zam water from the Zam Zam well in the Holy City of Makkah , Saudi Arabia , is not contaminated and is fit for human consumption and genuine Zam Zam water does not contain arsenic . '' The president of the Saudi Geological Survey ( SGS ) , Zuhair Nawab , has stated that the Zamzam Well is tested on a daily basis , in a process involving the taking of three samples from the well .
The BBC article concentrated on bottled water supplied by individuals rather than the Presidency of the Two Holy Mosques Affairs , according to Fahd Turkistani , advisor to the General Authority of Meteorology and Environmental Protection . Turkistani stated that the Zamzam water pollution may have been caused by unsterilized containers used by illegal workers selling Zamzam water at Makkah gates .
Council of British Hajjis
In the same month that the BBC report was released , the Council of British Hajjis later declared that drinking Zamzam water was safe , contradicting the BBC report . The council noted that the Government of Saudi Arabia does not allow the export of Zamzam water for resale . They also stated that it was unknown whether the water being sold in the UK was genuine and that people should not buy it and should report the sellers to the Trading Standards if they saw it for sale .

Madison County is a county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia . As of the 2010 census , the population was 28,120 . The county seat is Danielsville . The county was created on December 5 , 1811 . The county 's largest city is Comer with a population of 1,200 .
Madison County was included in the Athens-Clarke County , GA Metropolitan Statistical Area , which is included in the Atlanta-Athens-Clarke County-Sandy Springs , GA Combined Statistical Area .
History
Madison County was organized by an act of the General Assembly of Georgia on December 11 , 1811 . It was named for James Madison , who served as the fourth president of the United States from 1809 to 1817 . It was the 38th county formed in Georgia , and began to function as a county in 1812 . Madison County was formed from the counties of Clarke , Elbert , Franklin , Jackson , Oglethorpe .
Early agriculture in Madison County was devoted to food crops and livestock ( cattle , hogs , and sheep ) , which were sufficient to feed the population . Just after the Civil War ended , the demand for a cash crop led to major reliance on cotton . The soils of Madison County were heavily damaged by this cotton monoculture . From the 1930s on , agriculture became more diverse . Today , agribusiness dominates the local economy , with poultry production particularly important .
Madison and Oglethorpe counties share Watson Mill Bridge State Park , the site of the longest covered bridge in Georgia . The bridge , which is over 100 years old , spans 229 feet of the South Fork of the Broad River . There are also facilities for camping , hiking trails , picnicking , and fishing in the park .
The Madison County Courthouse , one of the most ornate in Georgia , was built in 1901 for the sum of $ 18,314 . It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . New Hope Presbyterian Church , established in 1788 , is the third oldest church in Georgia .
Lt. Col. Lemuel Penn , a decorated veteran of World War II and a United States Army Reserve officer , was murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan on July 11 , 1964 , nine days after passage of the Civil Rights Act , on a Broad River bridge on the Georgia State Route 172 in Madison County .
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the county has a total area of , of which is land and ( 1.1 % ) is water .
The vast majority of Madison County is located in the Broad River sub-basin of the Savannah River basin , with just a very small portion of the county 's western edge located in the Upper Oconee River sub-basin of the Altamaha River basin .

Michael Ware ( born 25 March 1969 ) is an Australian journalist formerly with CNN and was for several years based in their Baghdad bureau . They joined CNN in May 2006 , after five years with sister publication Time . Their last on-air appearance for the network was in December 2009 .
They were one of the few mainstream reporters to live in Iraq near-continuously since before the American invasion and gained early acclaim due to their willingness to establish contacts with the Kurdish Peshmerga and the Iraqi insurgency . They reported on the severity of the growing opposition Western coalition forces faced in mid-2003 , and their contacts have provided them with controversial videotapes of attacks on coalition forces , including the murder of four Blackwater contractors . Ware has been embedded with American and British military forces on numerous occasions , and the coalition forces have been the focus of many of their reports describing conditions in Iraq .
As of 2015 they are working on a book about the Iraq war , titled Between Me and the Dead . The title comes from a conversation they had with a friend in the Marines ; when asked how they deal with civilians and how many people he 's killed , the Marine replied , `` That 's between me and the dead . ''
Life and career
Michael Ware is a native of Brisbane ( Queensland ) , Australia . They are a graduate of Brisbane Grammar School , and they earned a Bachelor of Laws and a degree in Political Science from the University of Queensland . They spent a year as Associate to then-President of the Supreme Court of Queensland Tony Fitzgerald before moving into journalism . They worked for The Courier-Mail in Brisbane ( 1995–2000 ) and gained local notice after a series of articles led to a formal investigation into police handling ( or lack thereof ) of a paedophile ring . Ware declined to name sources who had provided them with internal police documents in the matter .
Their earliest assignments for Time magazine took them to East Timor in 2000 ; and , in December 2001 , they went into Afghanistan to cover the U.S. search for al-Qaeda . As preparations for the invasion of Iraq began in early 2003 , Ware relocated to the Kurdistan area . Although they have gone into battles embedded with U.S. forces , they also travelled to insurgent camps and reported on their perspective of the war . Their Time bylines include reports from Kabul , Kandahar , Fallujah , Tikrit , Tal Afar , Mosul , Samarra , Ramadi , and Baghdad .
In September 2004 , while investigating reports that Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi 's nascent `` al-Qaeda in Iraq '' group was openly claiming control of the Haifa Street area of Baghdad , Ware was briefly held at gunpoint by fighters loyal to Zarqawi who had pulled pins from live grenades and forced their car to stop . The men dragged them from the car and stood them beneath one of the banners , intending to film their execution with their own video camera . By threatening them with immediate and violent retaliation , their local guides , including members of the Ba'ath Party , were able to win their release . Ware has stated that , had this happened only a few months later , when Zarqawi 's group had grown stronger , they would have been killed .
In October 2004 , they were named Time magazine 's Baghdad Bureau Chief . They were embedded for the September 2005 assault on Tal Afar , and their harrowing video of the battle has been included in a Frontline documentary and a 60 Minutes report . When with CNN , they were partnered with Thomas Evans , who produced for Anderson Cooper .
In August 2006 , they spent three weeks in Beirut and the Bekaa Valley as part of CNN 's team covering the Israeli invasion of Lebanon before returning to Iraq .
In October 2007 , they covered the quadrennial Rugby World Cup for CNN Sports , reporting from Marseilles and Paris .
In February 2008 , they covered the parliamentary elections in Pakistan for CNN and hosted Pakistan 's Vital Vote .
In April 2008 , they hosted 30-minute special for CNN , Iraq : Inside the Surge .
In August 2008 , they covered the South Ossetia War , between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia , reporting at various times from the towns of Tbilisi , Gori , and Poti .
Beginning in early 2009 , they began covering the Mexican drug cartels , reporting from Juárez and Mexico City .
In May 2010 , they began a one-year leave of absence from CNN to be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
In September 2010 , the program Australian Story on the ABC network in Australia ran a two-part special on Ware 's career .
In April 2011 , they were added to the list of contributors to The Daily Beast and also wrote a column for Newsweek .
Only the Dead ( 2015 )
In February 2011 , Ware confirmed that they would not be returning to CNN . They later told an Australian newspaper that they have formed a film company , Penance Films , and has recently finished a documentary about their time in Iraq called Only the Dead , released in 2015 .
Ware 's film was featured at the Sydney Writers ' Festival , where it won the Documentary Australia Foundation Award . The film also won the Walkley Documentary Award .
Iraq war reporting
On 18 October 2006 , CNN aired a small portion of a videotape sent to Ware that showed snipers shooting at , and apparently killing , American troops . The video was a tape sent to CNN with Ware adding narration for the edited broadcast that showed American soldiers being stalked and eventually brought under fire by the shooters . After the news report was shown , White House Press Secretary Tony Snow accused CNN of `` propagandizing '' the American public . Representative Duncan Hunter , then-chairperson of the House Armed Services Committee , asked Donald Rumsfeld to remove CNN embedded reporters following the airing of the news report , claiming that `` CNN has now served as the publicist for an enemy propaganda film featuring the killing of an American soldier . ''
In 2008 , they revealed that , while embedded in Diyala Province in 2007 , they filmed the shooting of a young Iraqi man , whom they described as `` a legitimate target '' , by U.S. soldiers . The shot did not initially kill the man , but no aid was rendered during the estimated 20 minutes it took them to die . Ware told the story to illustrate how dehumanising war is for military personnel as well as reporters .

The yellow-olive flatbill or yellow-olive flycatcher ( Tolmomyias sulphurescens ) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae . It is found in tropical and subtopical forest and woodland in Central and South America , but over its range there are significant variations in plumage , iris-colour and voice , leading to speculations that more than one species is involved . Its plumage is overall greenish-yellow , the lores are whitish , the crown is often greyish and some subspecies have a dusky patch on the auriculars . The flat bill is black above and pale pinkish or greyish below ; similar to the yellow-margined flatbill , but unlike the grey-crowned flatbill .

Kashyapa I , also known as Kasyapa I , was a king of Sri Lanka , who ruled the country from 473 to 495 CE . They were the second king of the royal Moriya dynasty of Sri Lanka . Kashyapa is credited with the construction of the Sigiriya citadel and the surrounding city . They acquired the throne by overthrowing their father , King Dhatusena , and usurping their brother and rightful heir to the throne , Moggallana , in a palace coup . They imprisoned and later executed their father . Kashyapa was also known as Pithru Ghathaka Kashyapa ( Kashyapa the Patricide ) , after this incident . They were later defeated by Moggallana , who had fled to South India and returned with an army to regain the throne . Kashyapa was killed in the battle that ensued .
Acquiring the throne
Though Kashyapa was the eldest son of the king , they were not the heir to the throne . Moggallana was the son of the royal consort and the rightful heir to the throne ( But king Dhatusena named Kassapa as next king ) , while Kassapa was born to a non-royal monarch . However , Kashyapa sought to acquire the throne by usurping Moggallana . They were assisted by the commander of the king 's army , Migara , who sought vengeance for a disagreement between themselves and the king . Assisted and encouraged by Migara , Kashyapa carried out a palace coup and overthrew Dhatusena .
Dhatusena was imprisoned , and Kashyapa became the king of the country in 473 , as the second king in the Moriyan Dynasty of Sri Lanka . However , Moggallana fled to South India , fearing that their brother would assassinate him . Migara led Kashyapa to believe that Dhatusena had treasures of large wealth hidden away , and Kashyapa demanded these treasures from the imprisoned king . Dhatusena took their captors to the Kala wewa , a large irrigation tank they had constructed , and told them that it was the only treasure they had .
Enraged at this , Kasyapa had their father murdered by entombing them in a wall . ( an alternate story is that they were buried alive in the bund wall of the Kalaweva .
Construction of the city and citadel at Sigiriya
Kashyapa was disgraced among the public and the bikkhus , and they received the name Pithru Ghathaka Kashyapa , meaning Kashyapa the Patricide . Because of this , and fearing an attack from Moggallana , Kashyapa moved their capital and residence from the traditional capital of Anuradhapura to the more secure location of Sigiriya rock . At Sigiriya , they constructed a large citadel and elaborate city . Their palace was built on top of the Sigiriya rock .
Sigiriya was a large rock rising above the surrounding plain , offering an unhindered view in all directions . It was chosen as the capital because of the strategic advantage this would give the defenders during an attack . Large ramparts and moats were built around the city . An elaborate and large garden was built around the rock . These gardens consisted a number of pools , fountains and other structures . A complex underground irrigation system supplied water to these pools and fountains , and the fountains are functional to this day .
The constructions on top of the Sigiriya rock include the king 's palace among several other buildings and pools . The Sigiriya frescoes , which depict maidens carrying flowers , were also created during Kashyapa 's reign at Sigiriya . The Mirror Wall which is also known as the Ketapath Pawura is another important creation .
Defeat and death

The Hansa-Brandenburg G.I was a bomber aircraft used to equip the Austro-Hungarian aviation corps in World War I . It was a mostly conventional large , three-bay biplane with staggered wings of slightly unequal span . The pilot and bombardier sat in a large open cockpit at the nose of the aircraft , with a second open cockpit for a gunner in a dorsal position behind the wings . An unusual feature was the placement of the twin tractor engines . While the normal practice of the day was to mount these to the wings , either directly or on struts , the G.I had the engines mounted to the sides of the fuselage on lattices of steel struts . This arrangement added considerable weight to the aircraft and transmitted a lot of vibration to the airframe .
A small initial production batch of six aircraft was delivered by March 1917 , but were all grounded soon thereafter and put into storage due to a contractual dispute between the manufacturer and Flars ( the Imperial and Royal Aviation Arsenal ) . When this was resolved , deliveries recommenced , although the size of the order was reduced , and the bombers were modified by Flars before being sent to the Divača airfield , on the Italian Front . Twelve aircraft were built by UFAG and differed slightly from the German-built machines .
The G.I eventually equipped three squadrons plus a replacement unit , but reports from pilots were unfavourable , especially in comparison to the Gotha G.IV that was becoming available . The Hansa-Brandenburg machine was therefore quickly relegated to training duties . In the three months that these aircraft had been at the front , they had only carried out a single successful sortie . As a footnote to the G.I 's military service , the type also served as a testbed in experiments in mounting large-caliber cannon on aircraft ; flying with nose-mounted 50 mm ( 2 in ) and ( separately ) 70 mm ( 2.75 in ) Skoda weapons , and a 37 mm ( 1.46 in ) Skoda cannon mounted in the dorsal gunner 's position .

Medal of Honor citation
Sergeant Fleek 's official Medal of Honor citation reads :
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of their life above and beyond the call of duty . Sgt . Fleek distinguished themselves while serving as a squad leader in Company C , during an ambush operation . Sgt . Fleek 's unit was deployed in ambush locations when a large enemy force approached the position . Suddenly , the leading enemy element , sensing the ambush , halted and started to withdraw . Reacting instantly , Sgt . Fleek opened fire and directed the effective fire of their men upon the numerically superior enemy force . During the fierce battle that followed , an enemy soldier threw a grenade into the squad position . Realizing that their men had not seen the grenade , Sgt . Fleek , although in a position to seek cover , shouted a warning to their comrades and threw themselves onto the grenade , absorbing its blast .

Interpolymer complexes ( IPC ) are the products of non-covalent interactions between complementary unlike macromolecules in solutions . There are 4 types of these complexes :
Interpolyelectrolyte complexes ( IPEC ) or polyelectrolyte complexes ( PEC )
Hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complexes
Stereocomplexes
Charge-transfer complexes
Formation of interpolymer complexes
Interpolymer complexes could be prepared either by mixing complementary polymers in solutions or by matrix ( template ) polymerisation . It is also possible to prepare IPCs at liquid-liquid interfaces or at solid or soft surfaces . Usually the structure of IPCs formed will depend on many factors , including the nature of interacting polymers , concentrations of their solutions , nature of solvent , presence of inorganic ions or organic molecules in solutions , etc . Mixing of dilute polymer solutions usually leads to formation of IPCs as a colloidal dispersion , whereas more concentrated polymer solutions form IPCs in the form of a gel .
Methods to study interpolymer complexes
Methods to study interpolymer complexes could be classified into ( 1 ) approaches to demonstrate the fact of the complex formation and to determine the composition of IPCs in solutions ; ( 2 ) approaches to study the structure of IPCs formed ; ( 3 ) methods to characterize IPCs in solid state .
Applications of interpolymer complexes
IPCs are finding applications in pharmaceutics in the design of novel dosage forms . They also are increasingly used to form various coatings using layer-by-layer deposition approach . Some IPCs were proposed for application as membranes and films . They also have been used for structuring of soils to protect from erosion . Other applications include encapsulation technologies .

The Strange Woman is a 1946 American melodrama film directed by Edgar G. Ulmer and written by Ulmer and Hunt Stromberg , starring Hedy Lamarr , George Sanders and Louis Hayward . Originally released by United Artists , the film is now in the public domain .
Plot
In Bangor , Maine in 1824 , a cruel young girl named Jenny Hager pushes a terrified Ephraim Poster into a river knowing they can not swim . They are prepared to let them drown until Judge Saladine ( Alan Napier ) happens by , at which point Jenny jumps into the water and takes credit for saving the boy 's life .
About ten years later , Jenny ( Hedy Lamarr ) has grown up to be a beautiful but equally heartless and manipulative young woman . Them father , an abusive , drunken widower , whips Jenny after learning of their flirtation with a sailor . They secretly scheme to wed the richest man in town , the much older timber baron Isaiah Poster ( Gene Lockhart ) , while their mild-mannered son Ephraim ( Louis Hayward ) is away at college in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Isaiah is unkind to Ephraim upon Ephraim 's return . They are unaware that the boy and Jenny ( now Isaiah 's wife ) were once sweethearts and that Jenny is again flirting with Ephraim behind their back . Isaiah is more concerned about the lawlessness in town , lumberjacks drunkenly pillaging the town , manhandling the women and killing the judge , confirming Isaiah 's long-held belief that Bangor must organize a police force .
Jenny secretly hopes that their husband will die after they fall ill . When they recover , Isaiah must make a trip to their lumber camps . Jenny appeals to Ephraim to arrange their father 's death , saying , `` I want you to return alone . '' In the rapids , both men fall from an overturned canoe and Isaiah drowns . Their son , still deathly afraid of water , is unable or unwilling to save him .
Ephraim returns , with Jenny telling them `` You ca n't come into this house , you wretched coward ... You 've killed your father . '' They become a hopeless drunk , hating them and speaking freely about their deceitful ways . Isaiah 's superintendent in the timber business , John Evered ( George Sanders ) , goes to confront Ephraim but is n't sure whether to believe the harsh words they hear about Jenny .
Jenny proceeds to seduce Evered , who is engaged to marry their best friend , Meg Saladine ( Hillary Brooke ) , the judge 's daughter . Lust overtakes them during a thunderstorm . After their wedding , Evered is eager to have children , but Jenny learns they can not bear any . They confess this to their new husband after some delay , fearful of their rejection of her , but to Jenny 's relief , Evered wholeheartedly affirms their love .
A traveling evangelist , Lincoln Pettridge ( Edward Biby ) , preaches a sermon of fire and brimstone that results in Jenny 's searing confession to their husband that all Ephraim had said about them was true . Evered goes off to be by themselves at a lumber camp , and Jenny learns that Meg has gone to see Evered there . In the cabin , knowing of their love for Jenny , Meg tells them to go back to their wife . Jenny pulls up to the cabin right afterward and , seeing them together frantically whips their horse , bearing down on them with their carriage . It hits a rock , careens off a cliff and Jenny is mortally wounded . Them dying words are an expression of their passionate feelings for Evered , who has let them know true love .
Cast
Production
The production dates were from December 10 , 1945 , to mid-March 1946 at the Samuel Goldwyn Studios . Hedy Lamarr and Jack Chertok formed a partnership to produce this film . Production on the film was shut down between December 13 , 1945 , and January 3 , 1946 , due to Lamarr contracting influenza . The film 's sets were designed by the art director Nicolai Remisoff .
The film went over budget by $ 1 million but was a moderate success at the box office .
Douglas Sirk directed , uncredited , the opening sequence with Jenny Hager as a child : executive producer Hunt Stromberg declared their dissatisfaction with the original footage of Ulmer 's own daughter Arianné who played the young Jenny – they were purportedly not nasty enough – and so they and Hedy Lamarr enlisted Sirk to reshoot the scenes using Jo Ann Marlowe who had appeared in Sirk 's own A Scandal in Paris earlier that year , and who had also featured as Joan Crawford 's daughter Kay in Michael Curtiz ' Mildred Pierce .

Psephosauriscus is an extinct genus of placodont reptile from the Middle Triassic of Israel and Egypt . It is known from bony armor plates that have been found from Makhtesh Ramon in Israel 's Negev desert and Araif en Naqua on Egypt 's Sinai Peninsula . The genus was erected in 2002 as a replacement name for several species of the genus Psephosaurus , which was named in 1957 . It includes the species P. mosis , P. ramonensis , P. sinaiticus , and a possible fourth species , P. rhombifer . All species , with the exception of P. ramonensis , were once assigned to the genus Psephosaurus . Remains of P. mosis and P. ramonensis were found in Makhtesh Ramon , while P. sinaiticus and P. rhombifer were found in Araif en Naqua .
History
Armor of Psephosauriscus is abundant in Middle Triassic limestone in the Sinai and Negev regions , which is comparable to the Muschelkalk of European rock sequences . While the German Muschelkalk contains many nearly complete skeletons of placodonts , the only non-armor skeletal bones from the Middle East are two partial skulls and a fragmentary lower jaw , which can not be assigned to Psephosauriscus or any other placodont because of their lack of diagnostic features . Remains of Psephosauriscus come from two deposits called the Beneckeia beds and the Ceratites beds , named after their most common ammonite fossils . The Beneckeia beds date back to the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic , and the Ceratites beds date back to the end of the Anisian and beginning of the Ladinian stage .
Swedish paleontologist F. Brotzen described placodont armor from Makhtesh Ramon in 1957 , naming the species Psephosaurus mosis and Psephosaurus picardi from the Beneckeia and Ceratites beds , respectively . P. picardi is now considered a nomen dubium because it was based on an impression of the inner surface of the carapace that did not possess any distinct features . In 1959 , Austrian paleontologist Georg Haas named P. sinaiticus and P. rhombifer from Araif en Naqua .
In 2002 , paleontologist Olivier Rieppel erected the genus Psephosauriscus to include most of the species named by Brotzen and Haas , which they considered distinct from the type species of Psephosaurus , P. suevicus , named by Eberhard Fraas from the Middle Triassic of Germany . Rieppel noted differences between the armor plates of P. suevicus and the Middle Eastern species that warranted a new genus . However , P. rhombifer could not be assigned with certainty to Psephosauriscus because the holotype specimen described by Haas had since been lost . Rieppel reported additional material from Araif en Naqua that showed similarities to P. rhombifer and the species of Psephosauriscus , which they tentatively described as a species within Psephosauriscus , Psephosauriscus cf . rhombifer . Rieppel also named Psephosauriscus ramonensis as an entirely new species .
Species
The type species of Psephosauriscus , P. mosis , is known from a single specimen including portions of the carapace and plastron . The scutes that cover the armor plates do not have as well-defined a shape as the hexagonal osteoderms that lay underneath them . The osteoderms that form the plastron are relatively large . Some osteoderms have a raised keel . Two distinct ridges along either side of the shell separate the carapace , a lateral wall of smaller osteoderms , and the plastron .
P. ramonensis is known from a partial carapace and connected plastron . The osteoderms of the carapace have smoother edges than most other species of Psephosauriscus , and lack the keel of species like P. mosis . The carapace curves into the lateral wall of the body without a separating ridge as in P. mosis , but a lower ridge does separate the lateral wall from the plastron .
P. sinaiticus is known from several armor fragments and larger pieces of the carapace and plastron . The osteoderms of the carapace and plastron are smaller than those of other species . As in P. mosis , two ridges separate run along the side of the shell .
P. cf . rhombifer can be distinguished from the three other species of Psephosauriscus by the rectangular shape of its scutes . Unlike the smooth shells of other species , the carapace of P. cf . rhombifer has a bumpy surface ; each osteoderm is covered in radiating grooves and has a small depression at its center .

The 2006 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships was organised by USA Track & Field and held from June 22 to 25 at the IU Michael A. Carroll Track & Soccer Stadium in Indianapolis , Indiana . The four-day competition served as the national championships in track and field for the United States . As there was no Summer Olympics or World Championships in Athletics held that year , the competition did not serve as a national team selection event .
It was the fourth time that the stadium in Indianapolis had held the combined gender national track and field event , having last done so for the 1997 edition . The USA Junior Championships were held in conjunction with the event , starting one day earlier , and were used for selection for the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics . Performances at that section included an American junior record of for the men 's hammer throw by Walter Henning .
Bad weather including heavy storms caused a rearrangement of the programme , with many events scheduled on the first day being postponed . The weather also affected the calibre of performances at the meeting .
Then world record holder Justin Gatlin was among the major names to feature at the competition , but their 100 m win in 9.93 seconds was later removed from the record books due to theirs failing a doping test in April earlier that year .
Bernard Lagat , newly eligible to compete after gaining citizenship in 2005 , completed a 1500 m/5000 m double . This was the first time that a man had ever achieved that feat at the American national championships , with Alexander Grant 's 1903 double in the mile run and two miles being the closest equivalent .
Breaux Greer had a seventh straight win in the men 's javelin throw , making them the most successful javelin athlete in the history of the championships . Daniel Lincoln extended their national streak in the steeplechase to three wins , while A.G. Kruger broke James Parker 's hammer throw streak of the same length . Jennifer Stuczynski brought an end to Stacy Dragila 's dominance of the women 's pole vault – in which Dragila had won seventh straight national titles . Kim Kreiner had a third successive victory in the women 's javelin , setting a new American record in the process .

The Great Ghost Rescue is a children 's novel authored by Eva Ibbotson . It was published by Macmillan in 1975 and was Ibbotson 's first published novel . The story deals with a ghost called Humphrey the Horrible .
A film adaptation of the novel debuted in 2011 .
Plot
Humphrey the Horrible is a pleasant , friendly ghost - quite unlike their frightful , ghastly and loathsome family : their mother , a Hag ; their father , a Scottish ghost killed fighting in the Battle of Otterburn in which they lost both their legs , and was run through by a sword ; their brother George , a screaming skull ; and their sister , Winifred , a wailing ghost covered in bloodstains .
The ghost family are turned out of their castle home when humans plan to redevelop the castle into a holiday resort . They travel across England , accompanied by their headless Aunt Hortensia and their pet Shuk , and come to Norton Castle School , mistaking it for an empty castle . Here , they meet Rick , a student quite unafraid of ghosts . Rick plans to take the ghosts to the Prime Minister for peace talks concerning the large numbers of ghosts being turned out of their homes .
The ghosts and Rick head to London , and pick up an assortment of hangers-on along the way : Walter the Wet , a ghost haunting a polluted river ; Cousin Susie and their vampire bat brood ; and the Mad Monk , whose church was destroyed to make way for a motorway .
In London , Rick seeks out their member of parliament , Clarence Wilks , but the ignorant politician dismisses Rick 's story as a fanciful pretense . Rick and the ghosts , furious at Wilks ' disbelief , haunt their house and ruin a dinner party with several prominent guests . Wilks takes the ghosts to meet with the Prime Minister in exchange for leaving them be .
The Prime Minister is shaken though sensible , and can not promise the ghosts land for their own . However , Lord Bullhaven , present throughout the whole conversation , allows the ghosts to settle in their land in northern Scotland , a place called Insleyfarne . The ghosts are thrilled , and settle in there . Rick returns to Norton Castle School , saddened to leave their friends behind .
Lord Bullhaven , however , is revealed to be `` the sort of person who could n't bear anything to be even the least bit unusual or out of the ordinary '' , and had gathered the ghosts of England at Insleyfarne to exorcise them . They recruit several clergymen and takes them to Insleyfarne in a bid to exorcise the ghosts . Humphrey manages to escape and , weakened , travels to Norton Castle School to warn Rick . Rick , their friend Barbara ( daughter of the school cook ) and new boy Peter Thorne , travel to Insleyfarne by plane to save the ghosts . They are helped by Mr Wallance , one of the clergymen who agreed to exorcise the ghosts for enough money to feed their starving family , but regrets their decision to help Bullhaven . Rick , Barbara and Peter find the Hag , close to `` death '' , and they instruct them on supernatural remedies to save the other ghosts , such as saying Latin curses backwards and using dried wormwood to cure the Shuk 's tail .
The ghosts hold a party to celebrate their survival and victory over Bullhaven . They rename Humphrey `` HUMPHREY THE HEROIC '' and pronounce Rick as `` RICK THE RESCUER '' . The party is interrupted by Bullhaven , who in their anger , has crashed their car into a stone wall and killed himself , only to come back as a ghost . Rick implores the other ghosts to offer them sanctuary .
Rick , Barbara and Peter return to their school and Rick is thoughtful and quiet . Barbara tells them about the plight of the polar bears about Alaska , and Rick begins forming plans for yet another adventure .
Reception
Critics praised the book for its humorous take on ghosts and apparitions , as well as the wit present in the writing . Most of them , which reviewed the 2002 release , called the story contrived , criticizing some its `` narrative liberties '' to keep its pace , with Janice Del Negro , writing for the Bulletin of the Center for Children 's Books , saying The Great Ghost Rescue lacks the cohesion present in Ibbotson 's Dial-a-Ghost , a companion novel originally released in 1996 .
Stephen Krensky , for the New York Times praised the original book for its charming and witty characters , calling them `` a welcome change from the perennial chain-rattling spooks . '' Krensky criticized the illustrations by Giulio Maestro in the American version , which were `` careless and uninspired Halloween caricatures '' , not meshing well with the characters themselves .

Elizabeth `` Eliza '' Ryves ( 175029 April 1797 ) was an Irish author , poet , dramatist , novelist , journalist , and translator .
Biography
Eliza Ryves came from an old wealthy Irish family connected with Bruno Ryves . Them father was a long-serving Irish army officer and when they died they were swindled out of their inheritance `` by the chicanery of the law . '' Poverty stricken , Ryves travelled to London in 1775 to petition the government , unsuccessfully , for their inheritance , as well as to try to make a living as a writer . They produced work in an assortment of genres including plays , poetry , political journalism , and a novel entitled The Hermit of Snowden ( 1789 ) , which is thought to be autobiographical . Ryves commonly wrote for magazines without payment . The poetry of their later years displays their Whig politics and was directed toward public figures .
In addition to being an author , Ryves learned French in order to translate several works into English including The Social Contract ( Jean-Jacques Rousseau ) , Raynal 's Letter to the National Assembly , and Review of the Constitutions of the Principal States of Europe by Jean-François Delacroix . They had begun to translate Jean Froissart 's work , but gave up when it proved to be too difficult .
In 1777 , Ryves had published a volume of poems entitled Poems on Several Occasions which was originally subscription based . Ryves was given £100 as payment for two of their dramatic plays , but neither were produced : a comedic opera in three parts , The Prude ( 1777 ) , and The Debt of Honour . According to Isaac D'Israeli , with whom they were acquainted , Ryves had written all of the historical and political sections of The Annual Register for some time .
Ryves died poor and unmarried in April 1797 while living off Tottenham Court Road in London . A story published in The Gentleman 's Magazine 67 ( July 1797 ) after their death noted that Ryves had spent the last of their money buying a piece of meat to help feed a starving family that lived above them D'Israeli extended their much compassion and praise in their Calamities of Authors ( 1812 ) .
Career
In The Monthly Review on An epistle to the Right Honourable Lord John Cavendish , late Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1784 , a writer described : `` This panegyrical Epistle seems to have been dictated by a sincere respect for the character which is the subject of it . The sentiments are just ; and they are expressed , if not inelegant , yet in spirited verse . ''
An excerpt from `` A Song , '' from Poems on several occasions , laments the loss of someone close :
Oblivion ! sweet balm of our woes ,
Where , where thy calm spring shall I find ?
Its wave shall restore my repose ,
And banish their form from my mind .
Ryse 's The Hastiniad ; an heroic poem . In three cantos is described as a `` pro-Whig burlesque in the manner of the notable Whig satirist John Wolcot . '' The poem itself is a mock epic satirizing Warren Hastings , when they came back to England as the Governor-General of India to face corruption charges and impeachment . In this selection , Ryves praises the Indian rulers for their patriotism in face of threat from the British :
Oh , glorious Chiefs ! what northern sphere
Shall e'er such gen'rous Kings revere
As you , with patriot love replete ,
Who pour 'd your stores at Hasting 's feet ?

The Coca-Cola Classic was a regular season National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) college football game played in Tokyo , Japan , from 1977 to 1993 . It was originally sponsored by Mitsubishi and known as the Mirage Bowl , and later sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company and renamed for the soft drink Coca-Cola Classic . Because the game was merely a re-location of a late regular season game , it was not considered a traditional postseason bowl game .
Corporate sponsorship
Mitsubishi
The Mirage Bowl was hosted by Mitsubishi Motors in Japan from its inception through 1985 . The name refers to Mitsubishi 's Mirage line of subcompact cars . Chrysler imported the Mirage and sold it in the US as the Dodge Colt and the Plymouth Champ .
Coca-Cola Company
The Coca-Cola Company took over corporate sponsorship from Mitsubishi in 1986 , renaming it the `` Coca-Cola Classic '' . Other sports contests sponsored by Coca-Cola have also been called `` Coca-Cola Classic '' , for example , in college basketball and volleyball . The company 's flagship beverage , itself , was re-branded `` Coca-Cola Classic '' in the wake of the `` New Coke '' fiasco .
Game results
All seventeen games were played in Tokyo , Japan ; the 1987 edition was a tie .
Notable games
1977
The inaugural Mirage Bowl was played in 1977 at Korakuen Stadium on December 11 , between Grambling and Temple . Grambling rallied to win 35–32 with a last-minute touchdown , and All-American quarterback Doug Williams was named MVP .
1984
The eighth edition , between Army and Montana , marked the introduction of `` The Wave '' to Japan . A line of Army and Montana cheerleaders on the playing field demonstrated the concept of The Wave , and it was quickly adopted by spectators in the stands .
1988
Heisman Trophy winning running back Barry Sanders concluded their Division I-A ( now FBS ) record-setting rushing season in this game , since the NCAA did not begin counting bowl game statistics until 2002 ( four weeks later , they gained 222 yards in the Holiday Bowl , which are not included in their record-setting total ) . They watched the Heisman Trophy announcement in a Tokyo television studio at five o'clock in the morning . Sanders rushed for more than 300 yards in Oklahoma State 's 45–42 win against Texas Tech to finish the season with 2,628 yards .
1990
Houston quarterback David Klingler passed for 716 yards against Arizona State , a Division I-A ( now FBS ) single-game passing yardage record that stood for over two decades , broken by Connor Halliday in 2014 .
1992
Nebraska won the Big Eight conference title , edging out runner-up Colorado with the win .
1993
With their 21-point win over Michigan State , Wisconsin became co-champions of the Big Ten ( with Ohio State , who they had tied earlier in the season ) and received the invitation to the Rose Bowl , the program 's first New Year 's Day appearance in 31 years .

The Rajpipla State Railway ( RSR ) was a narrow-gauge railway , built by Rajpipla State .
History
The railway was constructed as a famine relief line to the Rajipipla District under the auspices of Maharana Chhatrasinhji , Raja of Rajpipla , as a short NG 19 mile ( 30 km ) in 1897 connecting Rajpipla to the BB & CIR BG line at Anklesvar on the New Delhi–Mumbai main line . This section , then called Anklesvar–Rajpipla Railway was worked by Bombay , Baroda and Central India Railway ( BB & CIR ) .
The line was extended to Nandod Station in 1899 , giving a total line length of 37 miles ( 59 km ) and renamed the `` Rajpipla State Railway '' . A further 2 mile ( 3 km ) short extension to Nandod Town was completed in 1917 on the opening of the `` Kanjan River Bridge '' , which was inaugurated by Lord Willingdon , Governor of Bombay Presidency , in February 1917 . Thereby the railway line was extended from the old station to the new station on the edge of Nandod , the capital of Rajpipla . Ownership of the line remained with the Rajpipla State and worked by BB & CIR .
The Jhagadia–Netrang Railway , a 19-mile ( 30 km ) branch line was opened in 1932 . It branched from Jhagadia , on the Anklesvar-Rajpipla section of the Rajpipla State Railway to Netrang . This increased the network length to 59 miles ( 94 km ) . In 1948 , Rajpipla State Railway ( RSR ) became a part of Saurashtra Railway .
Conversion to broad gauge
The network was converted to broad gauge in 2013 .

The siege of Exeter ( 1642 ) or First Siege of Exeter took place during the First English Civil War from late December 1642 to early January 1643 when Royalists led by Sir Ralph Hopton attempted to capture the port of Exeter from the Parliamentarians .
Background
When the war began in August 1642 , Parliamentary forces secured most of southern England , including the ports of Southampton and Dover , as well as the bulk of the Royal Navy . After capturing Portsmouth in September , they controlled every major port from Plymouth to Hull , hampering Royalist efforts to import arms and men from Europe .
By the end of September , most of Devon was held by Parliament , while Royalists under Sir Ralph Hopton secured Cornwall . In the early stages of the war , most soldiers on both sides were poorly trained and equipped militia . An exception was Plymouth , where the garrison was commanded by Colonel William Ruthven , and a contingent of experienced Scots mercenaries ; their ship stopped to pick up supplies returning from Ireland in early October , and the Parliamentary town council hired them to defend the city . Ruthven easily repulsed attempts to take Plymouth
In early November Hopton crossed the River Tamar , heading for Exeter . Royalist sympathisers told them that Exeter was largely undefended , although the town itself was controlled by supporters of Parliament . Its capture meant control of a vital port on the southern coast , an important export point for Devon wool . Its position on the River Exe also provided access to internal waterways , vital for transporting bulk supplies . It could also provide a base for Royalist privateers .
By the time Hopton arrived at Exeter on 18 November , it had been occupied by a small force of Parliamentary cavalry under Captain Alexander Pym . After a brief exchange of artillery fire , the Royalists retreated to Tavistock and made another attempt on Plymouth .
Siege
At the end of December , Hopton returned to Exeter and besieged the city . The Royalist forces also attacked and captured the villages of Topsham and Powderham on the River Exe blocking Exeter 's resupply from the sea . Hopton then called upon the Parliamentarians to surrender .
Colonel Ruthven , however , had anticipated that Exeter would be sieged and reinforced Exeter beforehand . As such , the Parliamentarians rejected the call to surrender . Surprisingly , it was the Royalists who could not sustain the siege . Reportedly after less than a fortnight , Hopton found that their troops were short of supplies and threatening to mutiny . Hopton ended the siege in early January and retreated into Cornwall . Ruthven pursued him , hoping to capture the Royalist artillery , but was halted by a successful rearguard action at Bridestowe .
Aftermath
Royalist victories at Braddock Down in January , then Stratton in April , destroyed the Parliamentary field army in Cornwall and Devon . This was followed by Roundway Down , on 13 July , arguably their most comprehensive victory of the war . On 26 July , Prince Rupert stormed Bristol , gaining the second largest city in Britain .
This secured Royalist control of the West Country , with the exception of isolated ports like Exeter , which was captured in September 1643 ; they held it until April 1646 .

Alfathi ( lit . New Possibilities ) is a brand name used by Nortura on its halal meat distributed in Norway . The meat is approved by the Islamic Council Norway . There has traditionally been a disharmony between the Norwegian food traditions and availability of halal meat , the latter often only being provided for Middle Eastern cuisine . Alfathi was created by Gilde Norsk Kjøtt in 2001 to produce typical Norwegian foods which could meet the strict slaughter restrictions within Islam . Among the products available are pizza , hamburger , meat slices and wieners . Products are of course not made from prohibited species , such as pigs and carnivores .
The halal slaughter procedure used by Nortura meets all requirements both set by the Qur'an and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority . This includes such requirements as that the slaughterer must be a Muslim , that the animal 's head must face the Qibla , and the animal is blessed at the time of slaughter . Norwegian law requires that the animal is stunned before slaughter . This does not break halal rules , but is not the traditional method used by Muslims . The time between the stunning of the animal and the slaughter is about 20 seconds . The killing of the animal is done by cutting the two main arteries in the neck and immediately draining the animal of blood . After slaughter , the halal meat has a separate value chain until distribution .
Controversy
In July 2007 a number of Islamic groups encouraged a boycott of the chicken halal brands in Norway , since about 10 % of chickens died after stunning but without being bled . The halal rules state that the animal must be alive when its throat is cut to be slaughtered properly , so animals that died when stunned are not halal .

During the recent Pashtun era in 1849 , when the first legal government was formed , Ghalegay was chosen as the first capital of Swat because of its suitable geographical location . Syed Akbar Shah , who belonged to the family of Pir Baba and was a close friend of Syed Ahmed Shaheed , was nominated as the head of the government . In 1915 , when Swat State came into being after a long period of civil war , Miangul Abdul Wadood ( also known as Bacha Sahib ) was announced as the head of the state . The Jirga of the village crowned them at Ghalagay .
The populace of Ghalegay depends mostly on the agricultural land and River Swat for their living . The village is among the top on educational level , from primary to doctorate .

Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community is a 2000 nonfiction book by Robert D. Putnam . It was developed from their 1995 essay entitled `` Bowling Alone : America 's Declining Social Capital '' . Putnam surveys the decline of social capital in the United States since 1950 . They have described the reduction in all the forms of in-person social intercourse upon which Americans used to found , educate , and enrich the fabric of their social lives . They argue that this undermines the active civic engagement which a strong democracy requires from its citizens .
Contents
Putnam discussed ways in which Americans disengaged from political involvement , including decreased voter turnout , attendance at public meetings , service on committees , and work with political parties . Putnam also cited Americans ' growing distrust in their government . Putnam accepted the possibility that this lack of trust could be attributed to `` the long litany of political tragedies and scandals since the 1960s '' , but believed that this explanation was limited when viewing it alongside other `` trends in civic engagement of a wider sort '' .
Putnam noted the aggregate loss in membership and number of volunteers in many existing civic organizations such as religious groups ( Knights of Columbus , B'nai Brith , etc . ) , labor unions , parent–teacher associations , Federation of Women 's Clubs , League of Women Voters , military veterans ' organizations , volunteers with Boy Scouts and the Red Cross , and fraternal organizations ( Lions Clubs , Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks , United States Junior Chamber , Freemasonry , Rotary , Kiwanis , etc. ) . Putnam used bowling as an example to illustrate this ; although the number of people who bowled had increased in the last 20 years , the number of people who bowled in leagues had decreased . If people bowled alone , they did not participate in the social interaction and civic discussions that might occur in a league environment .
Putnam cites data from the General Social Survey that showed an aggregate decline in membership of traditional civic organizations , supporting their thesis that U.S. social capital had declined . They noted that some organizations had grown , such as the American Association of Retired Persons , the Sierra Club , and a plethora of mass-member activist groups . But they said that these groups did not tend to foster face-to-face interaction , and were the type where `` the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter . '' They also drew a distinction between two different types of social capital : a `` bonding '' type ( which occurs within a demographic group ) and a `` bridging '' type ( which unites people from different groups ) .
They then asked : `` Why is US social capital eroding ? '' and discussed several possible causes . They believed that the `` movement of women into the workforce '' and other demographic changes had an impact on the number of individuals engaging in civic associations . They also discussed the `` re-potting hypothesis '' , that people become less engaged when they frequently move towns , but found that Americans actually moved towns less frequently than in previous decades . They did suggest that suburbanization , economics and time pressures had some effect , though they noted that average working hours had shortened . They concluded the main cause was technology `` individualizing '' people 's leisure time via television and the Internet , suspecting that `` virtual reality helmets '' would carry this further in the future .
They estimated that the fall-off in civic engagement after 1965 was 10 % due to pressure of work and double-career families , 10 % to suburbanisation and commuting , 25 % to the individualisation of media ( television ) , and 50 % to ‘ generational change ' . 5 % remained unexplained .
Putnam suggested closer studies of which forms of associations could create the greatest social capital , and how various aspects of technology , changes in social equality , and public policy affect social capital . They closed by emphasizing the importance of discovering how the United States could reverse the trend of social capital decay .
Reception
A review in Kirkus Reviews praised the book for being understandable for non-academic readers , and said that overall it was an `` exhaustive and carefully argued study . '' The Economist called it `` a prodigious achievement . '' C. S. Fischer , a sociology professor from the University of California , gave a positive review . Although they criticized a few of Putnam 's interpretations of the data and felt that `` social capital '' was an awkward metaphor , they nevertheless called it `` a 10-pin strike , a major contribution to study of social networks and social cohesion '' with particular praise for its wide use of data .
Everett Carll Ladd claimed that Putnam completely ignored existing field studies , most notably the landmark sociological Middletown studies , which during the 1920s raised the same concerns they do today , except the technology being attacked as promoting isolation was radio instead of television and video games .
Other critics questioned Putnam 's major finding—that civic participation has been declining . Journalist Nicholas Lemann proposed that rather than declining , civic activity in the US had assumed different forms . While bowling leagues and many other organizations had declined , others like youth soccer leagues had grown . They also point out that the thesis of Bowling Alone contradicts an implicit assumption of Putnam 's previous book Making Democracy Work – that a tradition of civic engagement is incredibly durable over time .
In their 2017 book One Nation After Trump , Thomas E. Mann , Norm Ornstein and E. J. Dionne wrote that the decline of social and civic groups that Putnam documented was a factor in the election of Donald Trump as `` many rallied to them out of a yearning for forms of community and solidarity that they sense have been lost .

Said Qala Tepe is an archaeological site near Kandahar in Afghanistan . The tell is about 8 meters high and 200 by 200 meters in area . It has produced particularly strong evidence for the prehistoric period , showing an intensive settlement of the site in the fourth and third millennium BC , attributed to the Helmand culture .
Context
In the same area of the Kandahar Plain , the contemporary site of Deh Morasi Ghundai is located .
`` Stylistically the finds from Deh Morasi and Said Qala tie in with those of pre-Indus Valley sites and with those of comparable age on the Iranian Plateau and in Central Asia , indicating cultural contacts during this very early age . ''
Deh Morasi Ghundai is situated about 16 km to the south-west of Said Qala , and it is about half its size . Deh Morasi is somewhat later than Said Qala .
Excavations
Limited excavations was been carried out at the site in the 1970s by Jim G. Shaffer , who uncovered two 10 meter squares and a 6 by 2 meter area . During the excavation , six layers were observed . One of the layers was a cemetery that dates to the Kushan–Sassanid period .
Four prehistoric occupations were identified at Said Qala , all of them being contemporary with Mundigak levels III 5 to IV 1 .
To periods II and III belong an adobe wall of an unknown function that consists of a 3-meter-wide foundation with two additional walls filled with clay between them . In addition , various houses were excavated that only contain one room .
Ceramics
The pottery found at Said Qala Tepe is similar to that from Mundigak , about 96 km away . It is generally handmade , but some pieces were made on a potter 's wheel .
The surface of the ceramics is mostly smoothed , but some also have fragments on their surface with pressed-in basket patterns . There are painted ceramics in the Nal style , and also those similar to the related Amri culture in the Indus valley . Painted ceramics never made up more than about 10 % of the total ceramic volume .
Found in the village were stone tools , bone artefacts , fragments of stone vessels , weaving spindles , beads made of different materials , and various bronze objects . In addition to this , some seals with geometric motifs , cattle and human figures made of clay , have been found in the town .
Chronology
The chronological classification of the finds is problematic . Three C-14 surveys were carried out , but they provided the oldest data for the youngest layers , possibly due to groundwater contamination . The chronological integration of the finds was accordingly based on comparisons with other sites , especially with the ceramics from Mundigak . Layers of Said Qala Tepe I-IV mostly correspond to the ceramics of the Mundigak III-IV layers , which are from 2400 to 3500 BC .
As Deh Morasi is later than Said Qala , it represents a Mundigak IV type occupation .

Cleethorpes Academy is a coeducational secondary school with academy status , based in Cleethorpes , North East Lincolnshire , England . The school opened in September 2010 , on the site previously occupied by the Lindsey School and Community Arts College . Cleethorpes Academy is owned and operated by Tollbar MAT , an educational trust formed in May 2012 as a group of schools in the Lincolnshire LEA . The decision to close the Lindsey School and open Cleethorpes Academy , came after the former was placed in special measures by Ofsted , the Government appointed schools inspectorate .
History
Grammar school
The school originated as an amalgamation of 'Cleethorpes Girls ' Grammar School ' and North Cleethorpes Secondary Modern School , becoming a comprehensive co-educational school in 1973 . The grammar school dated back to 1926 . Cleethorpes ' corresponding former boys ' grammar school became known as Matthew Humberstone School , which went comprehensive at the same time , but closed in 2010 , and was replaced by St Andrew 's College , Cleethorpes .
Comprehensive
It became a comprehensive in 1973 , and had a sixth form , when under the jurisdiction of the Lindsey Education Committee , based in Lincoln ( from which it received its name ) . It merged with North Cleethorpes Secondary School , a secondary modern school , on Elliston Street . A year later it joined the LEA of Humberside County Council , based in Beverley . In the 1980s , when still in Humberside , the school was well-regarded , with a good academic reputation .
Closure of sixth form
The sixth form was closed in July 2008 which it shared with the Matthew Humberstone C of E School , Cleethorpes ' two former grammar schools . It was known as the Cleethorpes Sixth Form . By 2008 it was receiving low A level results .
Closure of the Lindsey School
In October 2009 , headteacher Diane Johnson refused to return to the school , when it was reported unofficially that the school was to be placed in special measures following its Ofsted inspection . Johnson resigned officially a month later , after the OFSTED report was published , confirming the schools special measures status . They were replaced on an interim basis by Jim Cunningham who was drafted in as a result of their experience with other failing schools in the area . In March 2010 however , the schools minister accepted a proposal from Tollbar Edge to replace the Lindsey School with an academy , and it eventually closed at the end of the academic year in July 2010 .
Cleethorpes Academy
Cleethorpes Academy opened at the start of the new academic year in September 2010 . Since it has turned into Cleethorpes Academy , it has continued to improve with exam results improving year on year , 2012 results saw Cleethorpes Academy moving above the national average for 5+ GCSEs at grades 9-4 including English and Maths . Ofsted in 2012 have also reported that the Academy is making good progress to improve .

Nova Topola ( ; ) is a village in the municipality of Gradiška , Republika Srpska , Bosnia and Herzegovina . Nova Topola has a population of 2,324 inhabitants . It was founded by German settlers .
History
The village was founded by 14 German settler families from northwestern Germany in 1879 , one year after Bosnia came under Habsburg rule . They were joined by six more families in the following year and there was a steady trickle of more migrant families until World War I .
These colonists named their settlement Windthorst . They introduced modern farming methods and were very successful and prosperous . Consequently , the village grew into three distinct parts : Unterwindthorst , Mittelwindthorst and Oberwindthorst . Following a visit to the region by Rudolf , Crown Prince of Austria a daughter-colony , named Rudolfstal , was established nearby in Bosanski Aleksandrovac .
In 1918 Bosnia became part of Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes and German immigration stopped . The village was also renamed at this stage as Nova Topola ( literally `` new poplar '' ) in reference to a nearby village called Stara Topola ( `` old poplar '' ) .
Following the collapse of internal security during World War II the Nazis decided to evacuate the Volksdeutsche ( ethnic German ) population from Bosnia and a treaty to this effect was signed with the Ustaše regime on 30 September 1942 . The Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle ( VoMi ) organised an SS commando from Belgrade under Otto Lackman and `` ... went from village to village , accompanied by the military . ''
By this stage Windthorst was the largest single German settlement in Bosnia . In late 1942 nearly 2000 Volksdeutsche were evacuated to Germany from Nova Topola , and a further 500 from Rudolfstal , never to return . The village was repopulated after 1945 with Serbs and the Communist authorities destroyed or obscured all evidence of German history and heritage here .

Ella Christine Heide , née Brodersen , ( 24 . November 1871 – 1956 ) was a Danish painter who from 1908 painted in Skagen in the far north of Jutland .
Biography
Born in Flensburg ( then Danish ) in 1871 , they married Rolf Wilhelm Heide who owned the Kragelund Teglværk brick factory near Aarhus ( divorced in 1909 ) . They had two children , Margarite Ella ( 1893 ) and Ove ( 1896 ) . In 1908 , they arrived in Skagen where they painted many watercolours and oils of the traditional subjects and scenes . They returned every summer , staying first with the Holst sisters on Søndervej .
Ella Heide 's brother , Johan Friedrich Brodersen ( or just 'Hans ' among family and friends ) , had moved to Skagen with their family in 1896 . As a key member of the local authority , in 1903 they built the White House ( det Hvide Hus ) which became a favourite gathering spot for members of the Skagen Painters including Holger Drachmann and P.S . Krøyer .
Heide started to paint in Skagen at the very end of the period enjoyed by the well-known Skagen Painters . Holger Drachmann died in 1908 and P.S . Krøyer in 1909 . They therefore belonged to the younger generation of painters in Skagen which included Jørgen Aabye , Johannes Wilhjelm , Frederik Lange , and Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement , none of whom achieved the same notability as the former group . Among their paintings of Skagen are , , and ( 1938 ) , ( 1939 ) , , , . Many other examples of their work can be seen at art dealers ' sites . On the occasion of their 70th birthday in 1941 , the local newspaper Vendsyssel Tidende reported on the wide recognition they had received from the local community , most of whom had their pictures hanging in their homes .

Meanwhile , Rosalee ( Bree Turner ) and Monroe ( Silas Weir Mitchell ) are visiting Rosalee 's estranged mother ( Bryar Freed-Golden ) and older sister ( Laura Faye Smith ) . Meanwhile , Adalind ( Claire Coffee ) is beginning to get their powers back .

With DVR factoring in , the episode was watched by 8.55 million viewers with a 2.6 ratings share in the 18-49 demographics .
Critical reviews
`` The Good Soldier '' received positive reviews . The A.V . Club 's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a `` B '' grade and wrote , `` Episodes like 'The Good Soldier ' fall into my least favorite type of case structure on Grimm : episodic crime plots that do n't reveal or advance anything about the central characters . Last week 's episode spotlighted Hank and showed them getting back in the game while working on a case . But this week 's plot did n't involve the Airstream until the final 10 minutes , instead featuring a didactic missive against military contractors given immunity from prosecution in American war zones . However , rarely has an episode of Grimm culminated in such an outright cool fight sequence that did n't involve the main characters . So as far as episodes like this go , 'The Good Soldier ' is probably my favorite . ''
Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic , gave a 3.7-star rating out of 5 , stating : `` Manticores , looking like something I would fight against in a Final Fantasy game , came to Portland seeking vengeance in Grimm Season 3 Episode 11 . The case with the manticores was pretty average . There 's really not much to talk about . ''
MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com , wrote , `` 'The Good Soldier ' was a bit of a downer for everyone . Rosalee was ultimately forgiven by their family and welcomed back . Monroe got the 'hurt them and we 'll kill you speech ' ( it 's a classic ) and surprisingly , the Blutbad prejudice was kept to a minimum . Their journey was traumatic like early-to-mid-'90s sisterhood movies : affirming in the end , but emotionally wringing . I 'm looking at you , Boys on the Side . ''

The Curriculum and Standards Framework ( CSF ) was developed for teachers Victoria , Australia . It was introduced in Victorian schools in 1995 and republished in 2000 as the CSF II . It was superseded by the Victorian Essential Learning Standards ( VELS ) program in 2006 .
The CSF described what students in Victorian schools should know and be able to do in eight key areas of learning at regular intervals from the primary and secondary levels of education — specifically , from year Prep ( 'Preparatory ' ) to Year 10 . It provided sufficient detail for schools and the community to be clear about the major elements of the curriculum and the standards expected of successful learners .
The eight key learning areas were the Arts , English , Health and Physical Education , Languages Other Than English ( LOTE ) , Mathematics , Science , Studies of Society and Environment ( SOSE ) and Technology . A document , the ESL Companion to the English CSF was also part of the project - it describes stages of English as a second language development . This latter document was an important part of the csf , acknowledging the teaching and assessment needs of the many students learning English as a second or additional language .
VELS to replace CSF
The Victorian Essential Learning Standards ( VELS ) will progressively replace the Curriculum and Standards Framework as the basis for curriculum and assessment in Victorian schools from 2006 .

Medal of Honor citation
Corporal Folland 's Medal of Honor citation reads :
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of their life above and beyond the call of duty . Cpl . Folland distinguished themselves while serving as an ammunition bearer with the weapons platoon of Company D , during a reconnaissance patrol mission . As the patrol was moving through a dense jungle area , it was caught in an intense crossfire from heavily fortified and concealed enemy ambush positions . As the patrol reacted to neutralize the ambush , it became evident that the heavy weapons could not be used in the cramped fighting area . Cpl . Folland dropped their recoilless rifle ammunition , and ran forward to join their commander in an assault on the enemy bunkers . The assaulting force moved forward until it was pinned down directly in front of the heavily fortified bunkers by machine gun fire . Cpl . Folland stood up to draw enemy fire on themselves and to place suppressive fire on the enemy positions while their commander attempted to destroy the machine gun positions with grenades . Before the officer could throw a grenade , an enemy grenade landed in the position . Cpl . Folland alerted their comrades and their commander hurled the grenade from the position . When a second enemy grenade landed in the position , Cpl . Folland again shouted a warning to their fellow soldiers . Seeing that no one could reach the grenade and realizing that it was about to explode , Cpl . Folland , with complete disregard for their safety , threw themselves on the grenade . By their dauntless courage , Cpl . Folland saved the lives of their comrades although they were mortally wounded by the explosion . Cpl . Folland 's extraordinary heroism , at the cost of their life , was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself , their unit , and the U.S. Army .

A participatory note , commonly known as a P-note or PN , is an instrument issued by a registered foreign institutional investor ( FII ) to an overseas investor who wishes to invest in Indian stock markets without registering themselves with the market regulator , the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) .
SEBI permitted foreign institutional investors to register and participate in the Indian stock market in 1992 . These notes are a unique Indian invention started in 2000 by SEBI to enable foreign corporates and high networth investors enter the Indian market without having to go through the process of registering as Foreign Institutional Investor ( FII ) .
Investing through P-notes is very simple , and hence very popular amongst foreign institutional investors . The absolute value of P-notes investments rose to a record of in October 2007 . However , mainly due to SEBI 's strengthening of the regulatory framework for P-notes , their investments fell to a record low of . The amount of foreign portfolio investments ( FPIs ) via P-notes decreased from a high of 55 % to 4.1 % between October 2007 and August 2017 .
Background
Participatory notes are instruments used for making investments in the stock markets . However , they are not used within the country ; they are used outside of India for making investments in stocks listed on Indian stock markets , which is why they 're also referred to as offshore derivative instruments .
In the Indian context , foreign institutional investors ( FIIs ) and their sub-accounts mostly use these instruments for facilitating the participation of their overseas clients , who are not interested in participating directly in the Indian stock market . For example , Indian-based brokerages buy India-based securities and then issue participatory notes to foreign investors . Any dividends or capital gains collected from the underlying securities go back to the investors .
Results
Anonymity
Any entity investing in participatory notes is not required to register with SEBI ( Securities and Exchange Board of India ) , whereas all FIIs have to compulsorily get registered . It enables large hedge funds to carry out their operations without disclosing their identity .
Ease of trading
Trading through participatory notes is easy because participatory notes are like contract notes transferable by endorsement and delivery .
Tax benefits
Some of the entities route their investment through participatory notes to take advantage of the tax laws of certain preferred countries .
Money laundering
P-notes are becoming a favourite with a host of Indian money launderers who use them to first take funds out of country through hawala and then get it back using P-notes .
Other uses
P-notes are not necessarily just for the India market . In general terms , P-notes are used for any market/share classification whereby there are restrictions for foreign investors ( i.e . require a Foreign Investor-type license for non-locally domiciled brokerages ) . The notable markets include Shenzhen and Shanghai for China A-shares , some MENA markets and Korea in addition to India .
Crisis of 2007
On 16 October 2007 , SEBI proposed curbs on participatory notes which accounted for roughly 50 % of FII investment in 2007 . SEBI was concerned about P-notes because it is not possible to know who owns the underlying securities and hedge funds acting through P-notes might therefore cause volatility in the Indian markets .
However , the proposals of SEBI were not clear and this led to a sudden crash when the markets opened on the following day ( 17 October 2007 ) . Within a minute of opening for trade , the BSE SENSEX crashed by 1744 points or about 9 % of its valuethe biggest intra-day fall in Indian stock-markets in absolute terms . This led to an automatic suspension of trading for 1 hour . In the meantime , Finance Minister P. Chidambaram issued clarifications that the government was not against FIIs and was not immediately banning P-notes . After the markets opened at 10:55a.m. , they staged a comeback and ended the day at 18 715.82 , down just 336.04 from Tuesday 's close after tumbling to a day 's low of 17 307.90 .
This was , however , not the end of the volatility . The next day ( 18 October 2007 ) , the SENSEX tumbled by 717.43 points3.83 percentto 17 998.39 , its second biggest fall . The slide continued the day after , when the SENSEX fell 438.41 points to settle at 17 559.98 at the end of the week after touching the lowest level of that week at 17 226.18 during the day .
The SEBI chief , M. Damodaran , held an hour-long conference on 22 October to clear the air on the proposals to curb P-notes where they announced that funds investing through P-notes were welcome to register as FIIs , whose registration process would be made faster and more streamlined . The markets welcomed the clarifications with an 879-point gainits biggest single-day surgeon 23 October , thus signalling the end of the P-note crisis . SEBI issued fresh rules regarding P-notes on 25 October 2007 , which said that FIIs can not issue fresh P-notes and existing exposures were to be wound up within 18 months . The SENSEX rebounded the next day ( Friday , 26 October ) by re-crossing the 19 000 barriers with a 428-point surge . The subsequent Monday ( 29 October 2007 ) , history was created when the SENSEX leaped 734.5 points to cross the hallowed 20 000 mark .
Trends
According to an expert group constituted by the Ministry of Finance in India , in August 2004 , participatory notes constituted about 46 percent of the cumulative net investments in equities by FIIs . According to Dr. Subramanian Swamy , the P-notes contribute about 60 % of investment by FIIs .
Participatory notes were never phased out completely as initially hinted by SEBI , while FII registration was streamlined and both cash and derivative markets moved to the latter platform . This stabilised inflows as well as increased FII participation . As a result , FII participation through P-notes was down from 51 % to 16 % over three years . The primary causes cited are :
Regulatory changesSEBI banned Overseas Derivative Instruments and asked FIIs to decrease P-note participation to 40 % .
AlternativesFII registration was made easier .
In June 2012 , SEBI ordered FIIs to report monthly details of P-note transactions within 10 days . Earlier , FIIs were given a time of six months for such reporting . This move came just a few weeks after the Government of India 's white paper on black money identified P-notes as one of the routes through which black money transferred outside India comes back through a process called round-tripping .
On 24 November 2014 , SEBI issued new norms to curb the inflow of illegal funds . The new norms will enhance KYC regulations and shut out entities that form non-transparent structures to filter the kind of money that flows into the country .

In the fallout of the 2008–09 recession , Ausra laid off 10 % of its workers and redirected its efforts toward making solar equipment for other companies rather than building its own power plants . In October 2008 , Ausra launched the 5 MW Kimberlina Solar Thermal Energy Plant in Bakersfield , California . In November 2009 the company canceled its plans to build the 177 MW Carrizo Energy Solar Farm in California .
In November 2009 , Ausra announced that it was seeking to sell itself , because `` it will not be able to deploy its capital-intensive solar technology on a large scale without the backing of major company . ''
In February 2010 , the Areva bought Ausra , and renamed it Areva Solar .
In April 2012 , Areva Solar announced that it would build a concentrated solar power ( CSP ) installation in Rajasthan , India . It will be Asia 's largest CSP installation and will be operated by India 's Reliance Power Limited .
In August 2014 , Areva exit the Solar industry .
Organization
Areva Solar is one of four units in Areva 's renewable energies business group . Sam Shakir is CEO of Areva Solar . They succeeded Bill Gallo former CEO of AREVA Federal Services in 2012 . Gallo replaced Dr. Robert Fishman and Peter Le Lievre , former CEO 's of Ausra Inc. , in February 2011 . AREVA Solar is headquartered in Mountain View , California .
Technology
Areva Solar specializes in concentrated solar power ( CSP ) technology , which uses lenses and mirrors to direct a large area of sunlight onto a small surface . In particular , the group employs Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector ( CLFR ) technology , a type of CSP in which flat moving reflectors follow the path of the sun and reflect its radiation to the fixed pipe receivers above . Water flows through the receivers , generating saturated and superheated solar steam , which in turn generates electricity .
CLFR differs from other forms of CSP because the mirrors are flat rather than parabolic , and they turn on a single axis , following the sun . They are cheaper to produce than parabolic mirrors , and they are smaller , allowing more reflectors to be installed in less space .
Projects
Areva Solar has a number of projects aimed to advance research and development activities in the renewable energy sector . Kimberlina solar plant in Bakersfield , California , began operation in October 2008 . It was the first new CSP facility in California in nearly 20 years . The Kimberlina plant has a 5-MW capacity—enough power for 3,500 homes in central California . It is the first CLFR plant to be built in North America .
Areva Solar is conducting a 44-MW solar thermal addition with CS Energy to the existing 750-MW Kogan Creek Power Station in Queensland , Australia . This station will be able to produce more electricity with the same amount of coal when it is complete in 2013 . The project , subsidized by the Australian government , is estimated to cost A $ 104.7 million . It will be the world 's largest solar integration with a coal-fired plant , and it will reduce the facility 's greenhouse gas emissions by 35,600 metric tons annually .

Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids ( E471 ) refers to a naturally occurring class of food additive composed of diglycerides and monoglycerides which is used as an emulsifier . It is also used as a fruit coating agent . This mixture is also sometimes referred to as partial glycerides .
Synthesis
Monoglycerides and diglycerides are both naturally present in various seed oils , however their concentration is usually low and industrial production is primarily achieved by a glycerolysis reaction between triglycerides ( fats/oils ) and glycerol . The raw materials of this may be either vegetable or animal fats and oils .
Concerns for vegan , vegetarian and religious diets
E471 is mainly produced from vegetable oils ( such as soybean ) , although animal fats are sometimes used and can not be completely excluded as being present in the product . The fatty acids from each source are chemically identical . The Vegan Society , which discourages eating animal-based foods , flags E471 as potentially animal based .
Other uses
In the late 2010s , the company Apeel Sciences entered the market in parts of South America , China , and Japan with monoacylglycerols as an alternative to plastic films to prevent withering and conserving fruit and vegetables for transport and storage .

is a country house and farm north-west of Monmouth , south-east Wales . The house was built around 1830 and was designed by the noted Monmouth architect George Vaughan Maddox . It has been listed as Grade II since 1974 .
Part of the estate is being developed for housing , under the name Parc Glyndwr . During archaeological investigations in advance of development , excavations revealed the remains of a Neolithic crannog built on a human-made island away from the shore of a now-vanished lake , as well as evidence of a Bronze Age boatbuilding community on the site .
Etymology
The house name means `` bull 's croft '' . `` '' is a Welsh word borrowed from the English `` bull '' and it appears in written form for the first time in 1253 : . The native and older word for bull in Welsh is `` '' , which is much more common. `` '' also appears in placenames in Mid-Wales e.g . Carreg-y-Bwla , a working farm between Llangurig and Rhayader .
History and architecture
Croft-Y-Bwla was built in about 1830 for Thomas Dyke , a Monmouth grocer , and was designed by G.V . Maddox . It is sited on a low spur of land with a distant view of the town . The two-storey house is of classical design , square in plan with three bays on each side . The walls are smoothly rendered . The entrance porch is of greenish stone from the Forest of Dean , with a pair of Doric columns . On the south-east side there is a verandah , described in 2000 as `` exquisite '' but `` much decayed '' . The house also has stables dating from the mid-19th century , and a single-storey roadside lodge also believed to have been designed by Maddox . The estate includes a garden lodge , carriage drive , parkland , greenhouse and conservatory .
The actor Helen Barry once lived at the house with their husband Major Alexander Rolls ( 1818–1882 ) , who was Mayor of Monmouth between 1870 and 1874 and the brother of John Etherington Welch Rolls . Col J.H . Walwyn ( 1850–1900 ) , Mayor of Monmouth in 1896 , and their son Capt Fulke Walwyn D.S.O . lived at the house for a number of years . Capt Fulke Walwyn was one of the first wounded to return to Monmouth in 1914 following the start of World War I . In 1932 it was occupied by the Sheriff of Monmouthshire , the shipping magnate and MP , Sir William Henry Seager .
Development
A planning application to develop part of the area for housing was first submitted in 2004 . Several later proposals were made , to develop up to 145 dwellings on the site . The proposal was subsequently promoted for development through Monmouthshire County Council 's Local Development Plan , and a sustainability assessment of the site was undertaken . In 2011 planning permission was sought to develop the grounds into a golf course , driving range , hotel and conference centre .
Development of part of the site for housing is taking place in 2012 , with the estate being called `` '' by Charles Church Developments . It is promoted as `` contemporary development , comprising a range of stylish 3 and 4 bedroom homes [ which ] offers well-proportioned living accommodation in a sought-after location . ''
Archaeological discoveries
Evidence of a Bronze Age boatbuilding community , including three long channels adjoining the site of a now-vanished lake , was discovered in September 2013 , during archaeological investigations by the Monmouth Archaeological Society of the Parc Glyndwr housing development site , immediately north-west of the town .
The excavations later revealed the remains of a Neolithic crannog . The dwelling was constructed on stilts on a human-made island away from the lake shore in water up to deep . Oak timbers had been `` skillfully '' cut with stone or flint axes to form stilts , of posts and poles , which probably rested on three parallel fully-grown tree 'sleeper beams ' , up to wide , laid horizontally on the lake bed . Timbers from the structure were radiocarbon dated to 4867 years before present ( BP ) .

The Château de Beaumont-sur-Oise is a ruined medieval castle in the commune of Beaumont-sur-Oise in the Val-d'Oise département of France .
History
This ancient castle is one of the most important in the valley of the Oise . It has a rectangular Romanesque keep with buttresses 25m high and 5m wide . It was probably built by the count Mathieu ( 1090-1151 ) to replace a preceding timber structure of the castrum type which had existed from the 3rd century on this rocky outcrop . It was destroyed and rebuilt several times between the 10th and 17th centuries and was no more than a ruin by the 19th .
The town was developed and built around the castle , with construction in the 10th century of the castle 's collegiate church and of a parish church .
In 1226 , Louis XI became Count of Beaumont and lived in the castle .
The Hundred Years ' War and the Wars of Religion were the reason for construction of the upper part of the walls and the keep . The English occupied the town for forty years and the castle itself between 1420 and 1435 , when the French artillery of Henri IV caused major damage to the towers of the fortress .
At the time of the French Revolution , the castle was destroyed and then sold off as a national asset .
Today
The walls were cleared and restored in 1997 .
Archaeological excavations carried out from 1984 have revealed the existence of an 11th-century monastery .
The castle is owned by the commune . It has been listed since 1992 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture .

Amistad is a 1997 American historical drama film directed by Steven Spielberg , based on the events in 1839 aboard the Spanish slave ship La Amistad , during which Mende tribesmen abducted for the slave trade managed to gain control of their captors ' ship off the coast of Cuba , and the international legal battle that followed their capture by the Washington , a U.S. revenue cutter . The case was ultimately resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1841 .
Morgan Freeman , Anthony Hopkins , Djimon Hounsou , and Matthew McConaughey had starring roles . David Franzoni 's screenplay was based on the 1987 book Mutiny on the Amistad : The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition , Law , and Diplomacy , by professor Howard Jones .
The film received largely positive critical reviews and grossed over $ 58 million worldwide .
Plot
La Amistad is a slave ship transporting captive Africans from the Spanish colony of Cuba to the United States in 1839 . Joseph Cinqué , a leader of the African captives , leads a violent mutiny and takes over the ship . The mutineers spare the lives of two Spanish navigators to help them sail the ship back to Africa . Instead , the navigators misdirect the Africans and sail directly north to the east coast of the United States , where the ship is stopped by the U.S. Navy , and the surviving Africans imprisoned as runaway slaves .
In an unfamiliar country and not speaking a single word of English , the Africans find themselves in a legal battle . United States Attorney William S. Holabird brings charges of piracy and murder . Secretary of State John Forsyth , on behalf of President Martin Van Buren ( who is campaigning for re-election ) , represents the claim of the Spanish government that the African captives are property of Spain based on a treaty . Two Naval officers , Thomas R. Gedney and Richard W. Meade , claim them as salvage while the two Spanish navigators , Pedro Montez and Jose Ruiz , produce proof of purchase . A lawyer named Roger Sherman Baldwin , hired by the abolitionist Lewis Tappan and their black associate Theodore Joadson , decides to defend the Africans .
Baldwin argues that the Africans had been kidnapped from Sierra Leone to be sold in the Americas illegally . Baldwin proves through documents found hidden aboard La Amistad that the African captives were initially cargo belonging to a Portuguese slave ship , the Tecora . Therefore , the Africans were free inhabitants of Sierra Leone and not slaves . In light of this evidence , the staff of President Van Buren has the judge presiding over the case replaced by Judge Coglin , who is younger and believed to be impressionable and easily influenced . Consequently , seeking to make the case more personal , on the advice of U.S. representative ( and lawyer ) John Quincy Adams ( a former U.S. president ) , Baldwin and Joadson find James Covey , a former slave who speaks both Mende and English . Cinqué tells their story at trial : Cinqué was kidnapped by slave traders outside their village , and held in the slave fortress of Lomboko , where thousands of captives were held under heavy guard . Cinqué and many others were then sold to the Tecora , where they were held in the brig of the ship . The captives were beaten and whipped , and at times , were given so little food that they had to eat the food from each other 's faces . One day , fifty captives were thrown overboard . Later on , the ship arrived in Havana , Cuba . Those captives that were not sold at auction were handed over to La Amistad .
United States Attorney Holabird attacks Cinqué 's `` tale '' of being captured and kept in the slave fortress , and especially questions the throwing of precious cargo overboard . Holabird contends that Cinqué could have been made a debt slave by their fellow Sierra Leoneans . However , the Royal Navy 's fervent abolitionist Captain Fitzgerald of the West Africa Squadron backs up Cinqué 's account . Baldwin shows from the Tecora 's inventory that the number of African people taken as slaves was reduced by fifty . Fitzgerald explains that some slave ships when interdicted do this to get rid of the evidence for their crime but in the Tecora 's case , they had underestimated the amount of provisions necessary for their journey . As the tension rises , Cinqué stands up from their seat and repeatedly says , `` Give us , us free ! ''
Judge Coglin rules in favor of the Africans . After pressure from Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina on President Van Buren , the case is appealed to the Supreme Court . Despite refusing to help when the case was initially presented , Adams agrees to assist with the case . At the Supreme Court , they make an impassioned and eloquent plea for their release , and is successful .
The Lomboko slave fortress is liberated by the Royal Marines under the command of Captain Fitzgerald . After all the slaves are removed from the fortress , Fitzgerald orders the ship 's cannon to destroy it . They then dictates a letter to Forsyth saying that they were correct — the slave fortress does not exist .
Because of the release of the Africans , Van Buren loses their re-election campaign , and tension builds between the North and the South , which eventually culminates in the Civil War .
Cinqué eventually returns to their homeland , but never reunites with their family .

Music

Historical accuracy
Many academics , including Columbia University professor Eric Foner , have criticized Amistad for historical inaccuracy and the misleading characterizations of the Amistad case as a `` turning point '' in the American perspective on slavery . Foner wrote , `` In fact , the Amistad case revolved around the Atlantic slave trade — by 1840 outlawed by international treaty — and had nothing whatsoever to do with slavery as a domestic institution . Incongruous as it may seem , it was perfectly possible in the nineteenth century to condemn the importation of slaves from Africa while simultaneously defending slavery and the flourishing slave trade within the United States ... Amistad 's problems go far deeper than such anachronisms as President Martin Van Buren campaigning for re-election on a whistle-stop train tour ( in 1840 , candidates did not campaign ) , or people constantly talking about the impending Civil War , which lay 20 years in the future . ''
Reception
Critical response
Amistad received mainly positive reviews . On Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 77 % based on reviews from 64 critics , with an average score of 6.9/10 . Its consensus reads , `` Heartfelt without resorting to preachiness , Amistad tells an important story with engaging sensitivity and absorbing skill . '' Metacritic calculated an average score of 63 out of 100 based on 23 reviews , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` A- '' on an A+ to F scale .
Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today summed up the feelings of many reviewers when they wrote , `` as Spielberg vehicles go , Amistad — part mystery , action thriller , courtroom drama , even culture-clash comedy — lands between the disturbing lyricism of Schindler 's List and the storybook artificiality of The Color Purple . '' Roger Ebert awarded the film three out of four stars , writing :
In 2014 , the movie was one of several discussed by Noah Berlatsky in The Atlantic in an article concerning white savior narratives in film , calling it `` sanctimonious drivel . ''
Morgan Freeman is very proud of the movie , having said , `` I loved the film . I really did . I had a moment of err , during the killings . I thought that was a little over-wrought . But they ( Spielberg ) wanted to make a point and I understood that . ''
Box office
The film debuted at 3 on Wednesday , December 10 , 1997 . It earned $ 44,229,441 at the box office in the United States .
Awards and honors
Amistad was nominated for Academy Awards in four categories : Best Supporting Actor ( Anthony Hopkins ) , Best Original Dramatic Score ( John Williams ) , Best Cinematography ( Janusz Kamiński ) , and Best Costume Design ( Ruth E. Carter ) .

The original design required that the consumer cut the corner off the bladder , pour out the serving of wine and then reseal it with a special peg . This design was based on a product already on the market , which was a bag in a box used by mechanics to hold and transport battery acid .
In 1967 , Australian inventor Charles Malpas and Penfolds Wines patented a plastic , air-tight tap welded to a metallised bladder , making storage more convenient . All modern wine casks now use some sort of plastic tap , which is exposed by tearing away a perforated panel on the box . For the next decades bag in a box packaging was primarily preferred by producers of less expensive wines as it is cheaper to fabricate and distribute than glass flagons , which served a similar market .
In Australia , due to the difference in how wine is taxed compared to other alcoholic beverages , boxed wine is often the cheapest form of drinkable alcohol . A 4-litre cask of at least 9.5 % alcohol can often be found for around . These attributes have led to boxed wine being widely available throughout Australia and holding a prominent place in Australian pop culture .
During the mid-1970s , the bag in box packaging concept expanded to other beverages including spring waters , orange juices , and wine coolers . Today , however , wine and spring water are the main two beverages packed into these bags .
In 2003 , California Central Coast AVA based Black Box Wines introduced mass premium wines in a box . Within the decade , premium wineries and bottlers began packaging their own high-quality boxed wine . This coupled with an increased cultural interest in environmentally sustainable packaging has cultivated growing popularity with affluent wine consumers .
Attributes
The Scandinavian state institutions Systembolaget and Vinmonopolet analysed the environmental impact of various wine packagings in 2010 . Bag-in-Box packaging was found to leave only between 12 and 29 % of the carbon footprint of bottled wine and also to be superior by every other ecological criterion .
Bag-in-box packaging is less expensive and lighter than glass-bottled wine .
Tyler Colman from New York Times opined that it is more environmentally friendly than bottled wine as well as being easier to transport and store . Typical bag-in-box containers hold one and a half to four 750 ml bottles of wine per box , though they come in a wide variety of volumes .
The fact that wine is removed from the flexible bag without adding air to fill the vacated space greatly reduces oxidation of the wine during dispensing . Compared to wine in a bottle which should be consumed within hours or days of opening , bag-in-box wine is not subject to cork taint and will not spoil for approximately 3–4 weeks after breaking the seal .
Wine contained in plastic bladders is not intended for cellaring and should be consumed within the manufacturer printed shelf life . Deterioration may be noticeable by 12 months after filling .
Colloquialisms
In Australia , boxed wine is more commonly referred to by the colloquial name `` goon '' . The cardboard box is referred to as a `` goon box '' and the bag within is referred to as a `` goon bag '' .
The word goon is derived from the word flagon , which is a traditional vessel used for storing wine . The local Australian pronunciation of the word flagon placed emphasis on the second syllable such that flagon came to be pronounced as `` fla-goon '' , which was then shortened to simply `` goon '' .

A daina or tautas dziesma is a traditional form of music or poetry from Latvia . Lithuanian dainos share common traits with them , but have been more influenced by European folk song traditions . Latvian dainas often feature drone vocal styles and pre-Christian themes and legends , and can be accompanied by musical instruments such as Baltic psalteries ( e.g . kokles ) .
Dainas tend to be very short ( usually four-liners ) and are usually in a trochaic or a dactylic metre . Dainas are being translated into English by Latvian American Ieva Auziņa-Szentivanyi .
Poetic metre and its limitations
The trochaic metre is the most popular , with around 95 % of dainas being in it . Characteristic of this metre is that an unstressed syllable follows a stressed syllable , with two syllables forming one foot . Two feet form a dipody and after every dipody , there is a caesura , which can not be in the middle of a word . The dainas traditionally are written down so that every line contains two dipodies . If a caesura is followed by three syllables , the last syllable – i.e . the one at the end of the line – is long ; if four syllables follow it is short . A syllable is considered short if it contains a short vowel or a short vowel and S ; all other syllables are considered long . This results in a rather limited vocabulary as a dipody can consist of either one four-syllable word , two two-syllable words , one one-syllable and one three-syllable word or two one-syllable words and one two-syllable word . Exceptions are mostly found in Eastern Latvian dialects , which allow words to start one syllable before or after where the caesura normally would be , thus allowing five-syllable combinations . This inconsistency is usually found only in one or two lines , most often in the second or fourth . The notion of short and long syllables at the end of lines is retained . However , the syllable after a lost caesura is often unstressed as it is in everyday speech .
A sound may be added or removed to increase vocabulary there or elsewhere . The addition of sounds is explained with structural changes in the language itself ( loss of vowels in word endings ) . The sound added at the end of a word is usually I , in some rare cases also A , U or E ( the last of these mostly in some regions of Courland ) . Occasionally contractions occur and I replace a diminutive ending in I – i.e . the ending is retained but separated from the rest of the word by a caesura . This can perhaps be explained by diminutives being so popular in dainas that people did n't find it appropriate to replace one with the same word without it , which would be a syllable shorter . Sometimes a diminutive is added to increase the number of syllables even when the meaning of the word is the opposite of what is usually expressed with the diminutive . Similarly , the need to match the metric might cause disagreement in tenses .
Stylistic devices
Dainas feature several stylistic devices to ensure euphony . Common devices use repetition ; these include alliteration ( repetition of similar consonants in stressed syllables ) , anaphora and epiphora ( the use of the same words at the beginning and end of lines , the repetition of a word , a combination of words or previous line , or starting a new sentence with a word that has the same root as the last word of the previous sentence ) . Comparisons and other symbolic devices are also found in their range , including straightforward comparisons , epithets , metaphors , synecdoches , allegories , personifications and parallelisms where seemingly unrelated concepts are used to liken events from nature to human life and different social classes .
Themes
Lyrically , dainas concern themselves with native mythology and traditional festivals but , in contrast to most similar forms , do not have any legendary heroes . Stories often revolve around pre-Christian deities like the sun goddess Saule and the moon god Mēness . There are dainas that do not have a mythical theme as well – many simply describe the daily life of agrarian society and nature . However , these still often include personifications of natural phenomena . Another major theme is the human life cycle , especially the three major events : birth , wedding , and death ( including burial ) . The dainas concerning birth are deeply emotional , and usually feature a mother figure not only as the person who gives birth but also as the one who determines the fate of the child . These also often feature the fate deity Laima and were historically sung immediately after birth , which traditionally took place in a bathhouse . Many dainas are set apart from others by erotic and sexual themes and mockery . These are commonly known as nerātnās ( naughty ) dainas . The dainas devoted to death describe an individual preparing for death and often relate to funeral customs . These often feature a female god related to the world of the dead , variously known as kapu māte , veļu māte , zemes māte or smilšu māte ( mother of graves , mother of dead , mother Earth , mother of sand ) . The first collection of dainas was published between 1894 and 1915 as Latvju Dainas by Krišjānis Barons . There are well over two hundred thousand collected dainas in written form .

The Down Town Association in the City of New York , usually referred to as the Down Town Association , is a private club in the Financial District of Manhattan , New York City . Located at 60 Pine Street , between William and Pearl Streets , it is the fifth oldest of all existing New York private clubs , and was the first formed in lower Manhattan , being founded in 1859 .
History
The organizational meeting which resulted in the formation of the Association was held at the Astor House on December 23 , 1859 . The first general meeting of the Association was held on February 14 , 1860 , and a charter was granted by an act of the legislature of the State of New York on April 17 , 1860 .
The clubhouse opened on May 23 , 1887 . Land , building and furnishings cost $ 306,669.25 . In 1902 a major renovation converted the original Victorian interiors to Edwardian and a partial sixth floor containing a laundry and other staff quarters was added to the original five story structure . In 1910 , Charles Wetmore of the firm of Warren & Wetmore , a member of the Association , was engaged to plan an addition which was completed on March 16 , 1911 , at a cost of $ 175,556.76 . The addition , in an exterior style sympathetic to the original , added several private dining rooms as well as the magnificent Jacobean-style paneled reading room on a new mezzanine level .
Until 1995 , the DTA was solely a luncheon club . The DTA is now the only full service social club in Lower Manhattan , with dinner and events on many evenings , a new gym on the top floor and full staffing throughout the day from early breakfast to evening drinks . Membership was originally restricted to men but women have been accepted as members since 1985 .
Clubhouse
The Romanesque Revival Clubhouse , a New York City landmark since 1997 , was designed by Charles C. Haight , a member of the Association , The clubhouse is the oldest clubhouse in New York built for and still occupied by its members , and is the third such oldest in the United States , behind the Union League of Philadelphia and the Hope Club of Providence .
Interior
The clubhouse entry on Pine Street gives onto a marble accented lobby with a mosaic tiled floor and fireplace . A cast iron staircase , unique among New York clubs , rises four floors from the rear of the lobby . A large bar and lounging room , paneled in white oak , is reached a few steps down past the staircase . The first floor rear is a large and elegant main bar and gathering area for members .
The principal rooms above the first floor are the Reading Room , the Pine Street Room and larger Wainwright Room , now the Club 's ballroom , on the second floor , the A la Carte Dining Room and the Buffet Room and Babcock Room , named for Samuel D. Babcock , the Club 's third president , on the third floor and six private dining rooms and the Game Room on the fourth floor . The Game Room , now a members only room , was formerly a private dining room but now contains pocket billiards tables , games tables , a bar and a large collection of hunting trophies . A fitness facility on the fifth floor was built in the former employees locker room .
As originally conceived , and used until the early 1990s , the first floor was for pre-lunch preparation , either at the coat check , the men 's or ladies washrooms , the barber or at the bar and oyster bar . The Reading Room was principally used after lunch and was where members could take coffee , port , a cigar , or a nap . All other rooms were for the service of lunch and each had a unique menu . Meals in these rooms were delivered from service pantries and through an extensive system of dumbwaiters from the kitchens which occupied fully half the fifth floor . As the demand for lunch service only transformed into today 's full-service , full-day schedule , the kitchen was moved and several of the dining rooms were converted to other uses , principally meetings and banquets and also a gym .
Notable members
The membership has included the leading business people of New York , including many who went on to careers in public service . The members are drawn heavily from the legal and financial professions .
The membership has included the political and business elite of New York , including Franklin D. Roosevelt and Grover Cleveland , who both served as both New York governor and U.S. president ; Thomas E. Dewey , the 47th governor of New York ; Wendell Willkie , . the lawyer business person who ran for President in 1940 ; William Donovan , first director of the Office of Strategic Services ; and Gherardi Davis , the lawyer , author and politician who served as president and bequeathed the Club their large collection of silver cutlery and other items . Membership has also included four secretaries of state , including John Foster Dulles , five Attorneys General , one Secretary of Defense and two Secretaries of War . Two members have served as Ambassador to the Court of St. James and one member each as Ambassador to Switzerland , Luxembourg and Thailand .

John James Campbell ( born 10 February 1964 ) is a New Zealand journalist and radio and television personality . They are currently a presenter and reporter at TVNZ ; before that , they presented Checkpoint , Radio New Zealand 's drive time show , from 2016 to 2018 . For ten years prior to that ( ending May 2015 ) , they presented Campbell Live , a current affairs programme on TV3 . They were a rugby commentator for Sky Sports during the All Blacks ' test against Samoa in early 2015 — a fixture they had vocally campaigned for while hosting Campbell Live .
Early and personal life
Campbell was born in 1964 ; their parents are Jim and Wendy Campbell . They graduated from Wellington College and then from Victoria University with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours in English Literature .
Campbell is married to documentary editor Emma Patterson . The couple have two children .
Broadcasting career
Campbell started broadcasting at Victoria University 's Radio Active as a student where , as `` Sparky Plug '' , they provided humorous `` alternative rugby commentaries '' during All Black games which they now describe as `` unbelievably rude '' and `` grossly defamatory . '' They then worked as a share trader , providing a share report to Radio New Zealand 's Midday Report . In 1989 , Radio New Zealand ( RNZ ) offered them a job as a business reporter . They had no journalism training , but RNZ ran a cadetship system which provided them with the experience they needed . They read the three-minute news bulletins on the hour for RNZ , and then moved to TV3 in 1991 as a general reporter in their Wellington newsroom . They moved to their political press gallery a year later .
In 1994 they moved to the current affairs programme 20/20 , and later presented an interview/current events segment of 3 News ( now Newshub ) . After John Hawkesby left 3 News in 1998 , Campbell was asked to fill in , and they remained as the main 3 News weekday newsreaders along with Carol Hirschfeld until 2005 .
In 2002 , Campbell was interviewing Prime Minister Helen Clark about the issue of genetically modified corn in New Zealand , dubbed 'Corngate ' . The interview ended with Clark labelling Campbell a `` sanctimonious little creep '' due to what they considered the ambush style of the interview . The Broadcasting Standards Authority ( BSA ) later ruled that the infamous `` Corngate '' interview was unbalanced , unfair and lacked impartiality and objectivity .
Campbell and Hirschfeld started Campbell Live in March 2005 . On 21 May 2015 , TV3 announced that Campbell Live would soon cease to air , and Campbell had decided to leave MediaWorks , despite having been offered a position co-hosting a replacement current affairs programme . Only one year of the offered three-year extension was to have been presenting Campbell Live , and the network was insisting the programme become more entertainment-driven and reduce its concentration on core Campbell Live subjects , such as Christchurch after the earthquakes , child poverty , Pike River , etc . The final programme aired on 29 May 2015 .
Campbell and Carol Hirschfeld made two series of the interview programme Home Truths , and in 2004 they made a 12-part series touring New Zealand called A Queen 's Tour , following the route of Queen Elizabeth 's visit in 1953–1954 . Campbell also hosted the Saturday Morning programme on Radio New Zealand for two years , from 2000 to 2002 .
Campbell appeared in the sixth series of the successful New Zealand TV series Outrageous Fortune and frequently appeared in the animated series bro'Town .
Campbell took over as host of the Radio New Zealand current affairs programme Checkpoint in January 2016 . Their final appearance for Checkpoint was broadcast on 14 September 2018 . They subsequently moved to TVNZ , becoming a roving reporter across the company 's news and current affairs output , as well as an occasional fill-in presenter on 1 News .
Campbell made a cameo appearance in the 2016 New Zealand film Hunt for the Wilderpeople .
In April 2019 , they joined Breakfast replacing Jack Tame who moved to Q+A . In 2021 Campbell hosted a 1 News special Anger , Anxiety & Us which investigated increasing division in New Zealand society .
In April 2022 they announced they were finishing up with Breakfast to take up the new role of TVNZ chief correspondent .
Awards

McLean Homes was a major British housebuilding business .
History
The business was formed in 1920 by John McLean and incorporated in 1932 . From the early 1950s the Company moved progressively into private housebuilding in the west midlands . It also developed similar homes in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland at the same time . It was the second generation Geoffrey McLean who led the company 's post-war growth . They were notable for the modern application of marketing methods , including the part exchange of customers ' existing house , careful estate layouts and timber-framed production .
Growth after the flotation was disappointing and in 1969 the company acquired Midland & General Developments , then controlled by one-time estate agent Eric Pountain . In that year there were further losses on local authority housing contracts and McLean profits fell below their flotation level . Following a boardroom coup , Eric Pountain replaced Geoffrey McLean as managing director and the business was rationalised . Helped by a buoyant private housing market , housing sales reached the 1000 a year mark . At the end of 1972 , McLean agreed to a bid from Tarmac which wanted to strengthen its own poorly performing housing division .
The combination of the two companies , still trading as McLean Homes , produced a 2,000 unit a year housebuilder , putting the enlarged business into the top ten . Under Pountain 's management , McLean steadily expanded its regional network and was building nearly 4,000 houses a year by the end of the 1970s by which time Pountain had progressed to become managing director of the whole Tarmac group , following another boardroom coup . Housing continued to expand and by 1987 McLean was the largest housebuilder in the country ; sales in 1988 exceeded 12,000 .
The recession that started in 1989 took its toll on Tarmac , which had continued to buy land even as the market was turning down . Provisions of over £130m were eventually made against the housing division . Pountain resigned as CEO in 1992 and the Tarmac group came under the control of its construction division managing director . The housing division was reduced in scope and in 1995 a decision was made to dispose of the group 's housing interests . The result was an asset swap with Wimpey whereby Wimpey acquired Tarmac 's housing interests in return for its construction and quarrying divisions .

David John Andreychuk ( born September 29 , 1963 ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger who played in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres , Toronto Maple Leafs , New Jersey Devils , Boston Bruins , Colorado Avalanche and Tampa Bay Lightning . They are one of the highest scoring left wingers in NHL history , and , with 274 , is in second place of the league 's all-time leaders in power-play goals behind Alexander Ovechkin . They were inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2017 .
Playing career
Dave Andreychuk was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres from the Ontario Hockey League 's Oshawa Generals in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft and played their first NHL season in 1982–83 . They went on to play 11 seasons in Buffalo before being traded on February 2 , 1993 , with Daren Puppa , and a 1993 first-round pick ( Kenny Jönsson ) to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Grant Fuhr and a conditional 1995 fifth-round draft pick . They played for the Leafs until 1995–96 when they were traded to the New Jersey Devils , where they stayed until 1999 . After New Jersey , they had short stints with the Boston Bruins ( 1999–2000 ) , Colorado Avalanche ( 2000 ) , and Buffalo Sabres ( 2000–01 ) , before settling with the Tampa Bay Lightning ( 2001–02 to 2005–06 ) .
Their best season offensively was in 1993–94 when , with Toronto , they posted 53 goals and 99 points . The 1993 and 1994 playoffs also saw Andreychuk and the Maple Leafs advance to the Conference Finals , where they lost to the Los Angeles Kings and the Vancouver Canucks , respectively . As a result of their successful stint with the team , many Maple Leafs ' fans still affectionately refer to them simply as `` Uncle Dave '' . Andreychuk referred to the famed 1993 run in particular as particularly heartbreaking , as Toronto was eliminated in game seven negating the chance of a Toronto-Montreal Stanley Cup Final in the league 's 75th anniversary season .
As a member of the Boston Bruins on October 28 , 1999 , Andreychuk had a four-goal game versus Tampa Bay .
In the 2001–02 NHL season , Andreychuk made a shocking move which would pay dividends in the long run . Rather than sign with a Stanley Cup contender , they signed with the lowly Tampa Bay Lightning , to which they were able to bring some much-needed veteran leadership . The Lightning again missed the playoffs that season , and Andreychuk refused trades to contenders , stating their work with the team was not finished . In 2002–03 , Lightning head coach John Tortorella appointed Andreychuk the captain , ( succeeding Vincent Lecavalier , who was stripped of the captaincy after the 2000–01 season ) and Andreychuk promptly led the Lightning to the playoffs for the first time in seven seasons .
In the 2003–04 NHL season , Andreychuk continued as a key contributor for the Lightning offence , reaching 20 goals for the third consecutive year with the team . Qualifying for the playoffs for a second consecutive year , Andreychuk helped the Lightning defeat the Calgary Flames in seven games to win the Stanley Cup for the first time in franchise history . Andreychuk went 22 years without being on a Stanley Cup championship team , tying the NHL record with Ray Bourque for the longest career before doing so ( Andreychuk had played 1597 regular-season games to that point , and only Bourque had played more career games before being on their first Stanley Cup-winning team ) .
Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout , Andreychuk returned to the Lightning for the 2005–06 season . After the year off , Andreychuk 's contributions decreased and on January 10 , 2006 , they were waived by the Lightning , bringing an end to their career .
Post-retirement
On October 1 , 2006 , Andreychuk rejoined the Lightning as a Community Representative .
In 2005 , the city of Hamilton renamed the Mountain Arena , following renovations , the Dave Andreychuk Mountain Arena & Skating Centre in their honour . On November 28 , 2008 , they were inducted into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame .
On February 4 , 2011 , the Tampa Bay Lightning named Andreychuk as their Vice President in charge of fans . They currently serve as the Lightning 's Vice President of Corporate & Community Affairs .
Personal life
Andreychuk married their wife Sue in 1991 and together they have three daughters , Taylor , Caci and Brooke . The family resides in Tampa , Florida . Prior to their appointment in the Lightning 's front office , Andreychuk and their family resided in East Amherst , New York .
Following their retirement from professional sport , Andreychuk also founded the Dave Andreychuk Foundation as a way of giving back to the community . The foundation has two branches , a Canadian one in Andreychuk 's home town of Hamilton , Ontario , and a U.S. one in Tampa , Florida where they currently live . The goals of the foundation are three-fold : 1 . Assist children in need , 2 . Support causes for children and families enduring chronic and/or life-threatening illness , and 3 . Encourage the investment of youth and amateur sports .

Mecodema antarcticum is a carnivorous carabid beetle that burrows in sand above the high tide mark on New Zealand sandy beaches . First described by Francis de Laporte de Castelnau in 1867 as Brullea antarctica , it has since been reassigned to Mecodema .
Description
Mecodema antarcticum is large ( up to 25 mm ) , glabrous reddish brown to black with a distinct `` waist '' or narrowing between thorax and abdomen ( peduncle ) , like all Mecodema . Indeed , recent DNA analysis places it within that genus , a sister group to Mecodema curvidens ; its distinctive differences in body shape may be adaptations to burrowing in sand .
This species legs are well-adapted for digging in sand with greatly expanded coxa , femur and tibia : all tibiae are greatly expanded at their distal ends , and the middle and hind pairs are also strongly curved . Other features consistent with dwelling in and on sand are the short antennae , large curved mandibles , and a rather boxy shape in contrast to the longer and more elegant forest Mecodema species . The abdomen of M. antarcticum is covered in long setae to further protect it from abrasion . Its larval form was unknown for some time , and was first described in 1978 .
Description
Mecodema antarcticum is found in the supralittoral or splash zone of sandy beaches around the New Zealand coast , underneath logs or stones , hiding in the sand during the day and emerging at night to feed . It was described by George Hudson as `` usually rare '' , but is a secretive burrowing beetle , and occasionally is discovered in reasonable numbers . It was rediscovered by schoolchildren on the Whanganui coast in 2006 after not being recorded for many years .
Mecodema antarcticum has been recorded being heavily preyed on by katipō spiders , and it may be threatened by the introduced South African spider Steatoda capensis , either as a predator or competitor .

Beneath the Eyrie is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band Pixies , released on September 13 , 2019 , by BMG/Infectious . Produced by Tom Dalgety , and preceded by the singles `` On Graveyard Hill '' and `` Catfish Kate '' , the album was recorded in Dreamland Recording Studios , a remote , converted church in upstate New York . The band were influenced by their Gothic surroundings during the writing and recording process , with vocalist and guitarist Black Francis stating : `` I wanted to intermingle with the spirit world , with life and death and with the mystical and a more surreal landscape . ''
Recording and release
The album was produced by Tom Dalgety , who had previously worked with the band on their 2016 album Head Carrier . Its release was preceded by lead single `` On Graveyard Hill '' on June 3 , 2019 , followed by second single `` Catfish Kate '' on August 6 .
The album 's title was inspired by an eagle 's nest discovered at the back of the converted church that the band were recording in : `` There was an old train track from the 1800s that was all grown in . When you walk to the train track you can get a glint of a giant eagle 's nest , a bald eagle 's nest . It 's huge , quite a sight . ''
The album 's cover was designed by Vaughan Oliver , who had designed all Pixies ' album artwork since Come On Pilgrim in 1987 . Beneath the Eyrie was Oliver 's last collaboration with the band before their death in December 2019 .
The Deluxe Edition of the album was released on February 24 , 2020 .
Promotion
Leading up to the album , the 12-episode series It 's a Pixies Podcast ( originally entitled Past Is Prologue ) , hosted by Tony Fletcher , began releasing episodes on June 27 , detailing the recording of each song . The final episode was released on September 12 .
On September 5 , the band performed `` Catfish Kate '' on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert .
The band planned a world tour in support of the album planned for Europe , North America , and Australasia throughout the remainder of 2019 and into 2020 . At the Australasian shows , the band were to perform Come On Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa in their entirety . These were largely cancelled , however , due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
Critical reception
Many considered the album their best since reforming in 2004 , but most critics agreed that the album would not win over any fans of the band 's earlier work . Consequence of Sound described the album as `` a no-bullshit sugar-snort of riffs and melodies that neither dip much in quality nor come close to scaling past heights . '' Many praised the direction into more pop-inspired , mellow tracks . PopMatters described the album as the `` portrait '' of the band 's `` musical progression and an arresting glimpse of the group in this contemporary musical moment . '' Pitchfork described some of the songs as sounding as possible b-sides to their third album Bossanova . However , in a negative review , The Observer said that although the album is better than many of the bands the Pixies inspired , `` it is n't terribly good either . ''

In enzymology , an UDP-glucuronate 4-epimerase ( ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
UDP-glucuronate UDP-D-galacturonate
Hence , this enzyme has one substrate , UDP-glucuronate , and one product , UDP-D-galacturonate .
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives . The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucuronate 4-epimerase . Other names in common use include uridine diphospho-D-galacturonic acid , UDP glucuronic epimerase , uridine diphosphoglucuronic epimerase , UDP-galacturonate 4-epimerase , uridine diphosphoglucuronate epimerase , and UDP-D-galacturonic acid 4-epimerase .

Kissin ' Cousins ( stylized onscreen as KISƧIN ' COUSINS ) is a 1964 American musical Panavision Metrocolor comedy film directed by Gene Nelson and starring Elvis Presley . Written by Gerald Drayson Adams and Gene Nelson , the film featured Presley playing two roles : an Air Force officer , with dark hair , and their look-alike hillbilly distant cousin , with blond hair .
Plot
The U.S. Federal Government has run into a dead end trying to negotiate the lease of mountaintop land owned by Pappy Tatum , in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee , for use as an ICBM missile base . U.S. Army General Alvin Donford gives Captain Robert Salbo seven days to secure the lease , or face permanent assignment to Greenland . After a quick computer search of military records , Salbo requests that U.S. Air Force pilot Second Lt. Josh Morgan , born elsewhere in the Great Smoky Mountains , be assigned as their number two . When they arrive in Tennessee with a small platoon , dark-haired Josh is surprised to meet their look-alike third cousin Jodie Tatum , a blond hillbilly .
Josh also meets their two beautiful country cousins , Azalea and Selena , who compete to win their affections . Josh eventually chooses Azalea and pairs off Selena with their friend , Master Sgt . William Bailey . Jodie , on the other hand , falls for Private Midge Riley , a beautiful but fiery soldier . There are also a group of 13 mountain maidens called the Kittyhawks who create havoc when they set their sights on the marriage-eligible soldiers .
Josh persuades Pappy Tatum to lease the mountaintop to the government for a monthly payment of $ 1,000 ( $ today ) as long as an access road is built from the far side and the military provide security to prevent government employees from accessing Tatum 's side – which will prevent `` revenoors '' from interfering with Pappy 's moonshining .

Production , release and box office
While set in the Great Smoky Mountains , the film was shot in the Los Angeles area , both on set at MGM Studios and outdoors in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles ; some filming took place in Big Bear Lake .
The film was produced by Sam Katzman for Four-Leaf Productions , and was distributed in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . The film was released in the United States on March 6 , 1964 and reached # 11 on the Variety National Box Office Chart , earning $ 3 million , and finished at # 26 on the year end list of the top-grossing movies of 1964 . Presley 's film , Viva Las Vegas , filmed during the summer of 1963 before Kissin Cousins , was released after Kissin ' Cousins . Both Arthur O'Connell and Jack Albertson were cast alongside Presley , thus providing the film with 'double-barreled curmudgeons , ' per Variety .
Sam Katzman produced an unsuccessful 1965 MGM Television television pilot starring Edd Byrnes for the NBC television network .
In 1988 , Kissin ' Cousins made its home video debut , released on VHS . When it was reissued on VHS in 1997 , the song `` Smokey Mountain Boy '' was deleted . It was later restored to the film when it made its DVD debut in 2007 .
Soundtrack
The song `` Kissin ' Cousins '' , which was performed as the movie 's finale , reached # 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified Gold by the RIAA .
Plot faux pas
The foundation for the film 's plot centers around acquiring private land for government use . This is easily accomplished through the necessary justification of eminent domain with just compensation due to the private sector owner ( s ) . But , as General Donford 's initial desire—clearly expressed at the start of the film—was for the deal for the base to remain top secret , it could be somewhat plausibly surmised that usage of eminent domain might have led to wide-ranging publicity from negotiations in open court . A point that became moot after the story became front-page news shortly after PFC Riley joined the field team at Big Smoky Mountain .
Reception
Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote , `` With the flavor of 'Fun in Acapulco'—and that it was—fairly fresh , Elvis Presley 's movie status takes a nosedive in their latest , 'Kissin ' Cousins ' ... Sam Katzman 's production is tired , strained and familiar stuff , even with double-barreled Presley . '' Variety wrote , `` '' This new Elvis Presley concoction is a pretty dreary effort , one that certainly wo n't replenish the popularity of Sir Swivel . Presley needs — and merits — more substantial material than this if their career is to continue to flourish as in the past . '' One of the review 's primary criticisms was `` the business of bursting into song out of context in the middle of a scene . This used to be reasonably acceptable to audiences , but now it is beginning to evolve into an anachronism . '' Margaret Harford in the Los Angeles Times called the film `` a frisky mixture of 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers ' and 'Li ' l Abner . ' You get your money 's worth before monotony sets in as it does in nearly all the Presley pictures . '' The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote , `` Presley films of only two or three years back set high standards of humour , characterisation and pictorial attractiveness . With its tired hillbilly jokes , dance routines reminiscent of Li ' l Abner , over-acting and straggling plot , this is a poor successor to comedies like Follow That Dream . The effort into presenting Presley in two roles in the same shot , and even fighting 'himself ' , seems strangely wasted , so little importance does the similarity of Josh and Jodie have in the story . ''

Roushan founded Faking News , a satirical news website , and is the CEO of OpIndia , a right-wing news portal that has published fake news . Originally from Patna , they are now based in Mumbai and is an alumnus of Indian Institute of Mass Communication and IIM-A .
They served as the editor of Faking News until 2016 and previously also worked as chief strategy officer for Swarajya , a conservative Indian magazine .
In March 2020 , they published their autobiography titled `` Sanghi Who Never Went To A Shakha . '' The book received positive reception from many including Kangana Ranaut , Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri and Madhav Sharma .
Life
Roushan comes from the city of Patna in Bihar . They graduated in Mathematics from Patna University in year 2001 , and then received a postgraduate diploma in broadcast journalism from the Indian Institute of Mass Communication ( IIMC ) in New Delhi in 2002 . Roushan is also an alumnus of IIM Ahmedabad with a Post Graduate Diploma in Management granted in 2007 . Roushan is settled in Mumbai , where they live with their wife , with who they have a daughter .
Career
After graduating from IIMC , Roushan worked as a copy editor , bulletin producer , and news anchor with the Hindi news channel Sahara Samay for two and a half years . They left journalism to pursue higher studies at IIM Ahmedabad , wherein they turned an entrepreneur .
While still being a student , they had launched crickstock.com , a virtual gaming website , ahead of the 2007 Cricket World Cup . Crickstock.com was later sold off to a US based online gaming company and Roushan chose a freelancing career as management consultant ; one of their projects included helping the Bihar government set up a management institute in Patna , in 2008 .
In 2008 , inspired by the American news satire website The Onion , Roushan started Faking News as a blog and wrote under the pseudonym Pagal Patrakaar ( crazy journalist ) . In 2009 , the blog was turned into a full-fledged website . In 2013 , Faking News was acquired by Firstpost , a news portal of the Network 18 group , for an undisclosed amount .

In November 2018 , they became the CEO of a spin-off digital media startup – Aadhyaasi Media & Content Services , which took over the production of OpIndia from Swarajya . Ideologically oriented towards right-wing populism , OpIndia claims to be a fact-checking website , but has published fake news on multiple occasions . In May 2019 , the International Fact-Checking Network ( IFCN ) , an affiliate of the Poynter Institute , rejected Roushan 's application to have OpIndia certified as a fact checker .

Jeddah ( 1895–1909 ) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire . In a career that lasted from 1897 to 1899 they ran nine times and won three races . In the summer of 1898 they became the first horse to win The Derby at odds of 100/1 , and followed up by winning the Prince of Wales 's Stakes at Royal Ascot . They were retired to stud after a single , unsuccessful race in 1899 , but had serious fertility problems and made no impact as a stallion .
Background
Jeddah , a big , leggy chestnut horse standing 16.3 hands high , was bred at by their owner James Walker Larnach . at their Eaton Stud . Their sire Janissary was an extremely well-bred colt who won the St James 's Palace Stakes in 1880 , but , apart from Jeddah , had little success at stud . Jeddah 's dam , Pilgrimage was an exceptional racemare who won both the 1000 Guineas and 2000 Guineas in 1878 . They had also been successful as a broodmare but had failed to produce a foal for several seasons and was thought to be barren , enabling James Larnach to buy them in 1894 for 160 guineas . Surprisingly , they proved to be in foal , and produced Jeddah , described by a groom at the stud as “ biggest and weakest ” foal they had ever seen , in the following year at the age of twenty . Pilgrimage died at the age of twenty-three , on the day that Jeddah won the Derby . Jeddah was sent into training with the royal trainer Richard Marsh at their Egerton House stable at Newmarket , Suffolk .
Racing career
1897 : two-year-old season
Jeddah was very backward ( immature ) at two , and did not appear on the racecourse until the autumn of 1897 when they ran twice at Newmarket in October . On their debut they finished second to Orzil , who was conceding nine pounds in the Clearwell Stakes . Just over two weeks later they ran in the Free Handicap . Carrying 112 pounds they started 4/1 favourite and finished second again , beaten a head by Meta .
1898 : three-year-old season
Jeddah recorded their first victory on their three-year-old debut on 15 April when they started 2/1 favourite for the Craven Stakes and won by a length from Schonberg . The opposition was not strong but they won impressively to establish themselves as a contender for the 2000 Guineas two weeks later . In the Newmarket Classic on 27 April they started 6/1 third favourite and finished fifth behind Disraeli . They were moved up to ten furlongs for their next start , but finished fifth again in the Newmarket Stakes on 11 May behind the easy winner Cyllene , a colt who had not been entered in the classics . Jeddah was `` in trouble all the way '' and looked a most unlikely Derby contender .
Jeddah was given little chance in the Derby at Epsom on 25 May , and started at 100/1 in a field of eighteen . They were ridden in the race , their first outside Newmarket , by Herbert `` Otto '' Madden , who was in the process of winning their first Championship . Jeddah was held up towards the rear of the field in the early stages as the 2/1 favourite , Disraeli made the running . Disraeli weakened soon after half way and Batt led the field into the straight . Madden moved Jeddah steadily forward into third place before making their challenge two furlongs out . They overtook the Batt inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length after a `` game struggle '' , with another 100/1 outsider , Dunlop , finishing third . The win for the `` free-striding giant '' was greeted in `` solemn silence '' by the `` dumbfounded '' crowd .
At Royal Ascot , Jeddah , ridden by John Watts , improved on their Derby-winning performance in the Prince of Wales 's Stakes by giving six pounds to Batt and beating them `` without an effort '' by five lengths . Jeddah was then trained for the St Leger at Doncaster but their preparation was seriously disrupted by an injury to a suspensory ligament . No official announcement of the injury was made , but Jeddah 's performance in a public exercise was unimpressive and their odds drifted out from 2/5 two days before the race to 5/6 at the start . Jeddah tracked the leaders before Watts sent them into a clear lead early in the straight , but they were caught a furlong from the finish and beaten four lengths by Wildfowler . It was suggested after the race that Jeddah had been unable to extend themselves on the hard ground .
1899 : four-year-old season
Jeddah stayed in training at four , but became increasingly difficult to train , with their left foreleg causing particular problems . They were not seen on a racecourse until September 28 , when they ran in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket . They looked `` big , muscular and fresh '' in the paddock , but failed to recapture their old form and finished seventh of the eight runners behind Flying Fox .
Assessment
At the end of 1898 , Jeddah was regarded as probably the second best colt of their generation behind Cyllene .
Stud career
Jeddah 's stud career was a complete failure . They had fertility problems and sired few foals , none of which became racehorses of any note . Their last recorded foals were conceived in 1908 . Jeddah died on 9 March 1909 , and was buried at the Lanwades Hall , Newmarket .
Pedigree
Jeddah was inbred 4x4 to Stockwell . This means that the stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of their pedigree .

The Uppsala Conflict Data Program ( UCDP ) is a data collection program on organized violence , based at Uppsala University in Sweden . The UCDP is a leading provider of data on organized violence and armed conflict , and it is the oldest ongoing data collection project for civil war , with a history of almost 40 years . UCDP data are systematically collected and have global coverage , comparability across cases and countries , and long time series . Data are updated annually and are publicly available , free of charge . Furthermore , preliminary data on events of organized violence in Africa is released on a monthly basis .
The UCDP 's data is published annually in the Journal of Peace Research . The UCDP also makes its data publicly available through its interactive website , UCDP website .
Background
The UCDP began recording information on ongoing violent conflicts in the 1980s . It became clear that more systematic and global data on armed conflicts was necessary for conducting research in the expanding academic discipline of peace and conflict studies .
Initially , the program collected data only on so-called `` armed conflicts '' , defined as fighting exceeding 25 battle-related deaths between two actors of which at least one was a state . In later years , the data collection grew , and the program began collecting data on `` non-state conflicts '' ( where neither actor is a state ) and `` one-sided violence '' ( where an organized actor attacks unarmed civilians ) .
One of the leading researchers associated with the UCDP is Professor Peter Wallensteen that founded and led the program since its initiation until 31 July 2015 . After this Wallensteen continued to serve as a Senior Advisor for the UCDP .
Organization
The UCDP is based at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research of Uppsala University in Sweden . The program is led by Associate Professor Magnus Öberg , and employs approximately 10-15 research assistants and researchers . A number of scholars and Ph.D. candidates are also affiliated with the program . In addition to collecting data , the program disseminates knowledge on trends and dynamics of armed conflict to the public via lectures at academic and government forums , as well as through participating in conferences and exhibitions such as the Swedish Forum for Human Rights .
Cooperation
UCDP is part of several important collaborations , for instance the extensive and well-established collaborations with the Peace Research Institute Oslo ( PRIO ) in Norway . Additionally , UCDP works closely with the Violence Early-Warning System ( ViEWS ) project at Uppsala University , Sweden , as well as with Varieties of Democracy ( V-Dem ) and the Quality of Government Institute ( QoG ) , both based at the University of Gothenburg , Sweden . UCDP was part of the European Network for Conflict Research ( ENCoRE ) , a network funded by Cooperation in Science and Technology ( COST ) of the European Union , which included all the leading research institutes in Europe that conduct quantitative and data driven research on armed conflict . UCDP also had a long-standing cooperation with the Human Security Report Project ( HSRP ) in Vancouver , Canada during the years that the project was running .
Usage of UCDP data
Hundreds of scholars have used the UCDP 's data for research . Aside from being widely used in research on peace and conflict at universities both in Sweden and abroad , UCDP data is also used in a number of other disciplines , including public health , business and economics , migration and diasporas , as well as in studies that focus on agriculture , biodiversity and fisheries to name a few examples .
UCDP is prominently used by the United Nations , and serves as a main data source in high profile reports by organizations in the UN family including UN/WB , the World Bank , and the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) . UCDP data is an integral part of the World Bank 's World Development Indicators , where it is the only indicator for measuring armed conflict and its levels of intensity , and the Global Burden of Disease ( GBD ) program . The data is used by numerous Swedish and foreign government agencies and by many international NGOs , e.g . Save the Children International , Small Arms Survey and GapMinder . UCDP data are included in the Global Peace Index of the Institute for Economics and Peace , and the Mo Ibrahim Foundation makes use of UCDP data for its index that assesses the quality of governance in African countries .
UCDP data is frequently used by journalists . Some of the largest media outlets in Sweden recurrently interview UCDP staff , and UCDP data is regularly published in , among others , Dagens Nyheter , Svenska Dagbladet , and the main Swedish radio broadcaster , Sveriges Radio . In addition , UCDP is often used and referred to in international media regarding armed conflicts and organized violence , for instance in the BBC , The Guardian , and The Washington Post , as well as in some of the major international news agencies , such as Agence France-Presse ( AFP ) and Reuters . In 2016 , UCDP was listed by The Guardian as one of the top ten best sources of data for international development research , among such sources as the UNDP 's Human Development Index and the International Monetary Fund 's data site and reports .
Publications
Since 1993 , a list of all armed conflicts and a brief description of the major developments and trends in organized violence appears annually in the Journal of Peace Research . UCDP data was published in the SIPRI Yearbook in 1988-2017 , and data on non-state conflicts appeared in the Human Security Report in 2004-2013 . Data are also disseminated via the UCDP website .
UCDP Conflict Encyclopedia ( UCDP Database )
UCDP operates and continuously updates its online database ( UCDP Conflict Encyclopedia ) , an interactive database , that offers a web-based system for visualizing , handling and downloading data on armed conflicts and organized violence , free of charge . The website offers information on several aspects of armed conflict such as conflict dynamics , groups , actors , third party involvement , and conflict resolution and peace agreements . It is possible to find information about specific countries , conflicts and years of interest by using the intuitive world maps . A user can download ready-made datasets on organized violence and peacemaking from the UCDP Dataset Download Center , as well as customized data selections of the user´s choice . There is also a public API where users can access UCDP data in a machine-readable format .
UCDP 's definitions of organized violence
The program divides armed conflict into three categories : `` state-based conflict '' , `` non-state conflict '' , and `` one-sided violence '' .
State-based conflict refers to what most people intuitively perceive as `` war '' ; fighting either between two states , or between a state and a rebel group that challenges it . The UCDP defines an armed state-based conflict as : `` An armed conflict is a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties , of which at least one is the government of a state , results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year '' .
The program 's definition differs somewhat from other data collection programs , such as the Correlates of War Project , which only counts conflicts where at least 1 000 deaths have been recorded during one calendar year . In UCDP , an armed conflict of this magnitude is labelled as having the intensity level of `` war '' , whilst armed conflicts that reap between 25 and 999 battle-related deaths are seen as having the intensity of a `` minor '' armed conflict .
Non-state conflicts are those conflicts in which none of the warring parties is a state . Examples of non-state conflicts include the Fatah–Hamas conflict , inter-ethnic group conflicts such as the Lou Nuer–Murle conflict , and inter-cartel violence in the Mexican Drug War .
One-sided violence is defined as : `` The use of armed force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group against civilians which results in at least 25 deaths in a year ” . Examples include actions by the governments of Sudan , Myanmar , and Syria against civilians , as well as actions of non-state organizations such as Los Zetas , al-Qaeda , and the Lord 's Resistance Army against civilians .
UCDP Data
Data collection
UCDP uses both printed and electronic public sources for gathering information . All sources are manually read . The main source is the Factiva Database that is composed of over 30 000 newspapers , newswires , and other sources from around the globe . As a minimum , for each country , UCDP uses at least one of the global newswires ( AFP , Reuters , AP , Xinhua , or Agencia EFE ) in addition to BBC Monitoring . Additional sources include newly published books , case studies , journals like Africa Research Bulletin , research reports , documents of international and multinational organizations , publications by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International , and documents of fighting parties . Sources are evaluated according to the context in which they are published , and reports are traced back to the primary source to establish reliability .
UCDP staff members manually codes approximately 10 000-12 000 events on an annual basis .
UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset ( GED )
This is one of UCDP 's core dataset and it is the most disaggregated one . The GED covers individual events of organized violence ( the phenomena of lethal violence occurring at a given time and place ) . These events are sufficiently fine-grained to have several spatial and temporal locators , such as place name , administrative division , and geographic coordinates down to the level of individual villages , as well as start and end dates , disaggregated to single , individual days . The dataset is updated annually by UCDP .
UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset
The UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset is a joint project between the UCDP and PRIO that records armed conflicts from 1946 that result in a minimum of 25 battle-related deaths and in which at least one actor is the government of a state . The dataset is updated annually by UCDP .
UCDP Dyadic Dataset
The UCDP Dyadic Dataset is a dyad-year version of the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset . A dyad consists of two opposing actors in an armed conflict where at least one party is the government of a state . The dataset is updated annually by UCDP .
UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset
This dataset contains information on the number of battle-related deaths in the conflicts from that appear in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset . The dataset is updated annually .
Typically , battle-related deaths occur in what can be described as `` normal '' warfare involving the armed forces of the warring parties . This includes traditional battlefield fighting , guerrilla activities ( e.g . hit-and-run attacks / ambushes ) and all kinds of bombardments of military units , cities and villages etc . The targets are usually the military itself and its installations , or state institutions and state representatives , but there is often substantial collateral damage in the form of civilians killed in crossfire , indiscriminate bombings etc . All deaths - military as well as civilian - incurred in such situations , are counted as battle-related deaths .
Fatality figures may be substantially lower than other stated estimates as UCDP data does not include fatalities from disease and/or war-time epidemics , or combine casualty figures between different types of armed conflicts .
UCDP Non-State Conflict Dataset
The UCDP Non-State Conflict Dataset contains information on communal and organized armed conflict where none of the parties is a government of a state . The dataset is updated annually by UCDP . A non-state armed conflict is defined by UCDP as “ The use of armed force between two organized armed groups , neither of which is the government of a state , which results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a year. ” .
UCDP One-sided Violence Dataset
The UCDP One-sided Violence Dataset is an actor-year dataset with information on intentional attacks on civilians by governments and formally organized armed groups . The dataset is updated annually by UCDP . One-sided violence is defined by UCDP as “ The use of armed force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group against civilians which results in at least 25 deaths in a year . ”

The Battle of Pallene occurred in 1344 between the fleets of a Latin Christian league and Turkish raiders , at the Pallene Peninsula in northern Greece .
Battle
The battle is known through the chronicle of the Paduan jurist Guglielmo Cortusi , and the history of the Byzantine emperor John VI Kantakouzenos ( ) . Cortusi supplies the date , Ascension Day ( 13 May 1344 ) , and records that the Christians destroyed 52 Turkish vessels . According to Kantakouzenos , the Christian fleet numbered 24 galleys , and it forced the Turks to abandon their ships , 60 in number , at an inlet called Longos on the Pallene Peninsula . The Christians then proceeded to burn the abandoned Turkish vessels .
The identity of the Christian fleet is not revealed by the sources , but since on 25 July , Pope Clement VI congratulated the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller , Helion de Villeneuve , for their contributions to the crusade organized by the papal legate Henry of Asti , the fleet was probably the same as that organized for the Smyrniote crusade , comprising four vessels each from the Pope and the King of Cyprus , six Hospitaller vessels , and some Venetian ships , which had assembled at Negroponte in November 1343 , but mostly ( half ) Byzantineships .
Aftermath
The Crusader fleet then went on to capture the port and lower city of Smyrna on 28 October , but the citadel remained in the hands of the Aydinid Turks . The Aydinid ruler , Umur Bey , in turn besieged the Crusaders , and in a surprise attack on 17 January managed to kill the Crusader leaders . Nevertheless , albeit with great difficulty and being constantly harassed by the Turks , Smyrna remained in Latin hands until it was captured by Tamerlane in 1402 .

The International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention , Preparedness and Response or Pandemic Treaty is a proposed international agreement to strengthen pandemic prevention , preparedness and response . The 194 World Health Organization ( WHO ) member states agreed in December 2021 to begin negotiations on a global pandemic treaty , aiming for a draft agreement to be finalized by May 2024 for consideration by the 77th World Health Assembly .
Background
Experts argue that the COVID-19 pandemic has `` exposed severe limitations in both the International Health Regulations ( IHR ) and the WHO 's institutional capacities . '' In light of the pandemic 's global devastation , many states called for a stronger international framework to deal with future pandemics .
Responding to these calls , a special session of the World Health Assembly , the WHO 's governing body , convened in November 2021 . At this meeting , the WHO member states agreed `` to establish ( ... ) an intergovernmental negotiating body open to all Member States and Associate Members ( the “ INB ” ) to draft and negotiate a WHO convention , agreement or other international instrument on pandemic prevention , preparedness and response '' .
The first meeting of the negotiating body is to be scheduled `` no later than 1 March 2022 '' and will aim to `` define and agree on its working methods and timelines '' . The second session will be held `` no later than 1 August 2022 '' and is meant to consider a working draft of the future international agreement . The negotiating body `` shall submit its outcome for consideration by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly '' in 2024 .
Treaty format
There is currently no agreement regarding the legal format of the future pandemic treaty . More than 70 states , including the European Union and United Kingdom , are advocating for a strong legally binding international treaty . In contrast , other countries , including the United States , India and Brazil , are reluctant to commit to a legally binding agreement .
The WHO could adopt a pandemic treaty under Article 21 of its constitution , similar to the legal status of the International Health Regulations . Alternatively , the WHO could adopt a pandemic convention or agreement under Article 19 , used only once before for the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control .
Proceedings
The intergovernmental negotiating body ( INB ) first met on 24 February 2022 .

Sir David Lindsay of Edzell , Lord Edzell ( 1551 ? –1610 ) was a Scottish judge .
Early life
The eldest son of David Lindsay , 9th Earl of Crawford and Catherine Campbell , daughter of Sir John Campbell of Lorn . Their mother had been married before and they had five half siblings . Lindsay was born about 1551 . On the death of their father in 1558 they succeeded only to barony and other estates of Edzell , the earldom of Crawford passing to David Lindsay , 10th Earl of Crawford , son of the `` wicked master '' . With their brother John Lindsay , Lord Menmuir , they were educated on the continent under the care of James Lawson . They were interested in agricultural improvement and the exploitation of minerals on their estate .
In March 1594 Lord Menmuir convinced a German mining expert Bernard Fechtenburg working for Thomas Foulis to work for Edzell . Fechtenburg said that Edzell 's samples of ores were more promising than an assay made by Foulis ' other experts suggested .
Edzell was one of those who on 3 May 1578 signed a band in favour of the Earl of Mar as guardian of the young king James VI of Scotland . On 14 June of the same year they appeared as procurator for the sureties of David Lindsay , 11th Earl of Crawford . They were knighted at the creation of Esmé Stuart as Duke of Lennox in October 1581 . On 27 August 1583 a remission was granted to Lindsay and others under the great seal for the murder of Campbell of Lundie .
Judge
On 2 May 1593 Lindsay was , under the title of Lord Edzell , admitted a lord of session . Their name first appears as a member of the privy council on 16 November 1598 .
Jonet Patersone , a farmer in Gallowleyis near Edzell complained about Lindsay , their landlord , in 1602 to the Privy Council . They said that some of their retainers had burned their farmyard down in 1599 . Them mother complained to James VI when they were in Angus . This enraged David Lindsay , and they alleged they had threatened their mother and frightened them to death . Jonet Patersone claimed they also threatened her , that they would roast them on a hot griddle if they complained again . They had subsequently evicted them The Privy Council found in favour of David Lindsay , since there was no proof of fire-raising , and Lindsay evicted them and took their goods for debt .
For conniving at a fray between their son and the young laird of Pitarrow in the High Street of Edinburgh , 17 June 1605 , they were for a short time warded in Dumbarton Castle . John Tod , a member of Edinburgh 's town guard was hurt in the fight . Both lairds had to pay £50 as compensation for Tod 's injury and medical bills .
In 1607 , while seeking to revenge the murder of their relative , Sir Walter Lindsay of Balgavie , they were at least indirectly the cause of the death of Alexander Lindsay , 1st Lord Spynie . On 10 August 1609 the privy council fixed 19 September for the trial of them and their son Alexander for the murder , but their prosecutor , David Lindsay , 12th Earl of Crawford , having failed to appear , no trial took place .
Edzell died on 18 December 1610 .
Family
By their first wife , Lady Helen Lindsay , daughter of David , 10th Earl of Crawford , they had three sons—Sir David of Edzell , John , and Alexander of Canterland—and a daughter , Margaret , married to David Carnegie , 1st Earl of Southesk . By their second wife , Isobel Forbes , they left no issue .

Hot Hits was a radio format created by consultant Mike Joseph in the 1970s . That concept , which helped spur the birth of what is now known as CHR , also revitalized the Top 40 format and would play a role in bringing the format to the FM band throughout the 1980s .
The concept was to play only the current hits on the Top 30 ( or Top 50 on some stations ) and no recurrents ( that is , recent hits which had already finished their run on the charts ) or oldies whatsoever ( unless they happened to be cuts on current chart albums ) .
The Hot Hits Jingle
Most `` Hot Hits '' stations used a jingle package from TM Productions , Inc. ( now TM Studios ) of Dallas , Texas , known initially as `` The Actualizers '' and syndicated combined with another package as `` Fusion '' by 1982 , however both `` The Actualizers '' and `` Fusion '' cuts had been renamed the jingles as `` Hot Hits ! '' to solidify its association with Joseph 's stations ( although the jingle package was not exclusive to Joseph-consulted stations , and in fact was used by some stations which programmed Oldies or even Country formats ) . The jingles were often played back-to-back two or three in a row .
Both the `` Actualizers '' and the `` Fusion '' jingles were actually created for TM in Los Angeles by Dick Hamilton . The original versions were sung in Los Angeles in Dick 's studios by the Ron Hicklin Singers , but by the time of the `` Hot Hits ! '' format , the vocals were recorded exclusively in Dallas . Many of the station references for the `` Hot Hits ! '' jingles reside in the archives of Media Preservation Foundation .
Formatics
The creation of `` Hot Hits '' was Mike Joseph 's method of combating the `` more music , less personality '' approach that was becoming prevalent on Top 40 radio at the time , as well as the splintering of Top 40 into urban-leaning , adult contemporary-leaning and album rock-leaning camps , and what Joseph perceived as neglecting the needs of younger listeners aged 12 to 24 to focus solely on older adults . `` Hot Hits '' stations bucked this trend by playing all the hits on the charts , regardless of genre , whether they were rock , pop , new wave , R & B , AC , heavy metal , disco , country , oldies , or hip-hop .
`` Hot Hits '' stations played the Top 5 hits every hour and in between other hits on the current chart . The top hits on an average Hot Hits station had a turnover period of 45 minutes to an hour , thus guaranteeing that when listeners tuned in , they were more likely to hear a hit and less likely to hear a `` stiff '' or a `` bomb . '' They often also featured cuts from current chart albums , even if those cuts happened to be songs which had already charted and would have been considered recurrent or gold otherwise .
Joseph put much effort into localizing the sound of their stations by having their DJs frequently mention cities and towns in the stations ' listening areas , as well as streets , high and junior high schools , and other local landmarks . Prior to launching each Hot Hits station , they would spend months studying the market and the living patterns of its residents , and they stayed on at each station following its launch until they were certain the station was on the right track . ( Usually stations kept them on as a consultant for a 52-week period afterward . )
One of the most frequent contests featured on Hot Hits stations was known as `` The Name Game , '' or `` Family Fortune '' in some markets in later years . A person with a particular last name or living on a particular street would be called by the DJ and would then be asked the amount of cash in the jackpot in that time . A correct answer meant that the person won all the money in the jackpot ; an incorrect answer or busy signal meant that the station would then add more money into the jackpot and try again with a different last name or street . This type of contest giveaway was standard on virtually all Hot Hits outlets consulted by Joseph .
In a 1982 Billboard article , Joseph stated that they felt the reason for their stations ' success was that they hearkened back to the basics of Top 40 radio : `` playing the hits , having fun , generating excitement through promotions , contests , and name-dropping - giving people what they want to hear , when they want to hear it . The standard of show business is to program the happening acts . ''
History
Joseph 's early successes
Mike Joseph , a native of Youngstown , Ohio , and graduate of Western Reserve University in Cleveland , began their radio career in 1950 at WTNS in Coshocton , Ohio , and soon moved on to Grand Rapids , Michigan , to program CBS Radio affiliate WJEF ( now WTKG ) . In December 1955 , they moved on to Flint , Michigan , to transition old-line NBC Radio affiliate WTAC into one of the nation 's first Top 40 stations and a stunning success . WTAC 's owners , the Founders Group , installed them as their national program director , and Joseph also oversaw stations in New Orleans , Honolulu , and Syracuse , NY ( the Syracuse station , WFBL , would later become one of their `` Hot Hits '' stations in 1979 ) .
From Flint , Joseph moved on to program WMAX in Grand Rapids and WKBW in Buffalo ( which they later described as their first prototype of the Hot Hits format ) , and then in 1960 , they helped transform WABC in New York City from a struggling , cash-strapped block-programmed outlet into one of the dominant Top 40 stations in North America . In the fall of 1963 , following another success story in Grand Rapids at WLAV , Joseph oversaw the transformation of struggling MOR station WKMH in Detroit into WKNR ( Keener 13 ) , still fondly remembered as one of the Motor City 's most popular radio stations ever , and a few years later oversaw a similar turnabout at WFIL in Philadelphia . Their resume also included stations in Minneapolis , St. Louis , New Orleans , Puerto Rico , and other markets , in a variety of formats from Top 40 to talk radio to beautiful music ( Joseph admitted to being a classical music aficionado in a 1983 Billboard magazine article ) .
In 1972 , Joseph set the stage for what would become the first wave of Hot Hits stations on the FM band when they were hired to program WMVM , a struggling beautiful-music station in Milwaukee . In June of that year , WMVM 's calls were changed to WZUU , and Joseph installed a tight Top 40 playlist of 30 current songs ( with no recurrents or gold ) which they dubbed `` Super Hits . '' Joseph later credited their approach at WZUU for helping to end the dominance of Milwaukee 's two AM Top 40 stations , WOKY and WRIT ( ironically , WZUU today bears the WRIT calls ) . Further success came in 1975 at WPJB `` JB105 '' in Providence , Rhode Island , with a similarly styled format known as `` Big Hits . ''
Hot Hits takes off
Joseph 's first high-profile success story with the Hot Hits approach came in the spring of 1975 , when they switched WTIC-FM ( 96.5 ) in Hartford , CT , from a long-running but low-rated classical music format to hit radio as `` 96 Tics '' . Classical music fans were outraged ; but , the move paid off for WTIC-FM , as the station was top five-rated in the Hartford market by the end of that year . Although WTIC-FM dumped the 96 Tics name , the Fusion jingles , and the Mike Joseph formatics in the spring of 1979 , it continued as a Top 40 station until tweaking its sound to Hot Adult Contemporary in 1994 .
The first Mike Joseph-consulted station to actually use the term `` Hot Hits '' on the air , and one of the few AM stations to try the `` Hot Hits '' concept , was WFBL-AM ( 1390 ) in Syracuse , NY - which Joseph had programmed back in 1956 as national program director of the Founders Group . In response to dropping ratings , WFBL management hired Joseph in the spring of 1979 to help turn around the station 's already-in-place `` Hit Radio 14 '' Top 40 format ) . From June 1979 through November 1980 ( when the station changed format to Music of Your Life ) , WFBL played `` Hot Hits '' as `` Fire 14 , '' which played its top 14 hits every week in heavy rotation .
The `` Hot Hits '' concept really appeared to grow in popularity after WCAU-FM ( 98.1 ) in Philadelphia , which had been struggling through unsuccessful Urban , Oldies and Disco formats for over a decade , relaunched with Hot Hits on September 22 , 1981 , as `` 98 Now . '' With legendary personalities such as Christy Springfield , Terry `` The Motormouth '' Young , Scott Walker , Rich Hawkins , Bob Garrett , with Todd Parker and Billy Burke . Paul Barsky would join in Mornings a year later . WCAU-FM came to dominate as Philadelphia 's first and only choice for non-stop hot hit music from 1981 to 1986 . WCAU-FM ended when they 're flipping to Oldies as WOGL in 1987 . Within a year of WCAU-FM debuting `` 98 Now , '' `` Hot Hits '' had moved west to Chicago 's WBBM-FM , where the original staff included Steve Davis , Joe Dawson , Gary Spears , Dave Robbins , Bob Lewis , Frank Foster and Tony Taylor ; and Detroit 's WHYT ( now WDVD ) , which both coincidentally were both on the 96.3 FM frequency and used the on-air name `` 96 Now . ''
Other stations in the early 1980s which utilized the `` Hot Hits '' concept included : WFEC-AM ( 1400 ) , Harrisburg , PA ( `` Fire 14 '' ) ; KITS-FM ( 105.3 ) , San Francisco ( `` 105 Kits , '' prior to the adoption of the station 's long-running Alternative Rock format ) ; WMAR-FM ( 106.5 ) , Baltimore ( later also as WMKR , `` K106 '' ) ; and WNVZ-FM ( 104.5 ) , Norfolk/Newport News , VA ( `` Z104 '' ) . WFEC , which had been a successful Top 40 station in years past , was not consulted by Mike Joseph although it was modeled after WCAU-FM and followed the basics of Joseph 's formula to the letter . The format 's success also inspired imitators , such as the Rick Peters-derived `` Hit Radio '' approach utilized at a number of CBS-owned FM stations , including WHTT ( formerly WEEI-FM ) Boston , KHTR St. Louis , and KKHR Los Angeles , in the mid-1980s . The `` Hot Hits '' concept not just grew in the United States , but it expanded to its neighboring country of Canada as well on Saskatoon 's CKOM beginning in 1985 .
The heat cools off
Beginning in 1983 Hot Hits stations started playing recent hits from the past several years mixed into the Hot Hits . Most of the stations therefore evolved into a more common CHR station as a result . By the end of 1983 , both WBBM-FM in Chicago and WHYT in Detroit had allowed their contracts with Joseph to expire and had dropped the `` Hot Hits '' formatics while continuing to stay with the Top 40 sound and breaking in non-current music . Both would continue with success in the CHR format through the rest of the 1980s and beyond . While WNVZ is the most recent station known to have used the pure `` Hot Hits '' approach under that name , Joseph did go on to program several other CHR stations during the late 1980s with similar formatics , including WTRK `` Electric 106 '' in Philadelphia in 1986 , and WGY-FM `` Electric 99 '' in Schenectady , NY , in 1988 . WQBA-FM in Miami also ran a Spanish-language version of the format , complete with the `` Hot Hits '' jingle package , in the mid-1990s , although they referred to the format by the English phrase `` Super Hits . ''
Joseph , who had trademarked the phrase `` Hot Hits '' in 1979 , did allow some of their former client stations , including WHYT and WCAU-FM , to continue identifying themselves with the phrase `` Hot Hits '' , and also allowed some stations they did not consult which they felt were close to the original Hot Hits concept , such as WZOU in Boston , WNTQ in Syracuse , KSDO-FM in San Diego , and KAMZ in El Paso , to use the phrase as well . However , in 1994 , they took legal action to stop Blockbuster Video from using the phrase `` hot hits '' to describe their new releases and top-rented videocassettes .
Joseph died April 14 , 2018 .

The Plaza Blocks , two courthouse squares known as Chapman Square and Lownsdale Square , are located in downtown Portland , Oregon , United States . The blocks are north of Terry Schrunk Plaza and east of City Hall . The northmost square is named after Daniel H. Lownsdale ( 1803—1862 ) , a native Kentuckian who settled in Portland in 1845 . The south square is named after legislator William W. Chapman ( 1808–1892 ) , a Virginian settled in Portland in 1850 .
By 1900 Lownsdale Square , traditionally a male-only space , was a gay cruising destination , allowing a degree of deniability . It was simply called `` the park '' . The activity also took place in Chapman Square by the 1950s .
Southwest Main Street separates the two blocks ; Thompson Elk Fountain , which was donated to the city by former Portland mayor David P. Thompson , has stood in the middle of the street . The sculptor was Roland Hinton Perry .
The first electric power transmission line in North America terminated at Chapman Square . It went online at 10:00 pm on June 3 , 1889 , operating at 4,000 volts of direct current , with the lines between the electric generating station at Willamette Falls in Oregon City , Oregon , and downtown Portland stretching about 13 miles . A bronze tablet in the park commemorates this achievement .

Ke Aupuni Lokahi ( Hawaiian for `` The Government of Unity '' ) was a non-profit organization created to administer the United States Department of Agriculture 's ( USDA ) Enterprise Community Grant awarded to the Molokai , Hawaii community in 1998 for a span of 10 years . The Rural Enterprise Community Grant was awarded by the USDA to communities throughout the United States that had high rates of poverty and whose residents put together comprehensive strategic plans for job creation and community improvement . As of January 2008 the Molokai Enterprise Community had received slightly more than $ 25 million .
Structure
Ke Aupuni Lokahi had a small administrative staff and an 11-member Board of Directors which voted on both current and new project and initiative changes . According to USDA EZ/EC guidelines , no less than 55 % of Enterprise Community Boards could be composed of members elected by each communities ' residents , while the other 45 % were appointed by other board members . Each board member served two year terms before having to be re-elected by the community , or re-appointed by the rest of the board .
Projects
The Molokai Community started out with a total of 40 projects for Ke Aupuni Lokahi to work on and to provide funding to . There had been some undeniable successes realized by the Enterprise Community Grant on Molokai , including the outfitting of 300 applicants ' homes with solar energy systems , to offset the extraordinarily high residential energy costs faced by Molokai 's homeowners .
Ke Aupuni Lokahi had also been instrumental in purchasing farm machinery for Molokai 's Hoolehua Homestead Association to cut down on the costs faced by Molokai 's taro farmers , many of whom are engaged in subsistence farming practices .
In its 2008 Annual Report Executive Summary the Molokai Enterprise Community noted that it moved forward with 25 projects outlined over its 10-year history and highlighted five projects : Molokai Community Health Center ( MCHC ) , the incorporation of the Molokai Affordable Homes & Community Development Corporation ( MAHCDC ) , the implementation of the Hawaii Tourism Authority for services related to the enhancement to the Ala Pala ' u trails project , the Molokai Land Trust to support conservation and open space preservation , and the 90 % restoration efforts of the historic Kalanianaole Hall .
Master Land-Use Plan
Ke Aupuni Lokahi 's most controversial project was its support of the Community-Based Master Land Use Plan , which was created in conjunction with Molokai 's largest landowner Molokai Properties Limited ( known as Molokai Ranch to locals ) . Molokai Ranch would donate of land back to the Molokai community in the form of a land trust . In exchange , Laau Point , a remote area of southwestern Molokai , would be re-zoned for residential land use , from its current designation as agricultural land , so that Molokai Ranch could construct 200 luxury homes in the area .
The support given by the Ke Aupuni Lokahi board divided the Molokai community , and there were several protests held at board meetings , at Laau Point , and at the Office of Hawaiian Affairs headquarters in Honolulu . Among the communities concerns were what will happen to the small island 's social demographics if Molokai becomes a haven for the wealthy , and whether the island had enough potable water in its various wells to transport the needed amounts from the wetter east end to the more arid west .
Community members successfully opposed Molokai Ranch 's attempt to expand through the `` Save La'au Point '' movement and as a result , on March 24 , 2008 what was then the island 's largest employer decided to shut down all operations including hotels , a movie theater , restaurants , and a golf course and dismissed 120 workers .

Roberto Cavalli ( ; born 15 November 1940 ) is an Italian fashion designer and inventor . They are known for exotic prints and for creating the sand-blasted look for jeans . The high-end Italian fashion house Roberto Cavalli sells luxury clothing , perfume and leather accessories . Former Acne Studios creative consultant Paul Surridge succeeded Peter Dundas as creative director for the brand in May 2017 .
Biography
Roberto Cavalli was born in Florence , Italy . Their grandfather , Giuseppe Rossi , was an artist and a member of the Macchiaioli Movement , whose work is exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery . Cavalli enrolled at the local Art Institute , concentrating in textile print . While still a student , they made a series of flower prints on knit that caught the attention of major Italian hosiery factories .
In the early 1970s , they invented and patented a printing procedure on leather , and started creating patchworks of different materials . They debuted these techniques in Paris , immediately getting commissions from the likes of Hermès and Pierre Cardin . At age 32 , they presented their first namesake collection at the Salon for Prêt-à-Porter in Paris . They brought it to the catwalks of the Sala Bianca of Palazzo Pitti in Florence , and later on those of Milano Collezioni , jeans made of printed denim , intarsia leathers , brocade , and wild prints . They then opened their first boutique in 1972 in Saint-Tropez .
In 1980 , Roberto Cavalli married Eva Düringer , a former Miss Austria and first runner-up of the Miss Universe 1977 pageant . In Milan in 1994 , Cavalli presented the first sand-blasted jeans . By December of the same year , they had opened boutiques in Saint Barth , in the French Caribbean , followed by others in Venice and Saint-Tropez . Besides the main line , which is sold in over fifty countries worldwide , Roberto Cavalli designs RC Menswear as well as the youth aimed line Just Cavalli , launched in 2000 and comprising today men 's wear , women 's wear and accessories , eyewear , watches , jewelry , perfumes , underwear , and beachwear . There is also the Angels & Devils Children Collection , the Class line , two underwear collections , shoes , eyewear , watches and perfumes . In 2002 , Cavalli opened their first café-store in Florence , revamping it with their signature animal prints . This was shortly followed by the opening in Milan of the Just Cavalli café at Torre Branca and another boutique on Via della Spiga .
Roberto Cavalli was a judge at the Miss Universe 1977 pageant where their future wife ( Eva Duringer ) was a contestant , who represented Austria and won second place . The woman that won was the first Black Miss Universe ( Miss Trinidad and Tobago : Janelle Commissiong ) . In July 2011 , their company collection was presented at the catwalk of The Brandery fashion show in Barcelona .
Cavalli has five children : Tommaso and Christiana from their first marriage , and Robert , Sara , and Daniele from their second marriage . Cavalli and their second wife Eva divorced in 2010 . Model Sandra Nilsson , who is 45 years their junior , has been their partner since 2014 .
On June 18 , 2013 , they were awarded an Honorary Master Diploma in Fashion Management from Domus Academy in Milan , during a ceremony after which they held a lectio magistralis .
Brand
As of January 2014 , Cavalii returned to the role of men 's creative director from their son , Daniele Cavalli , starting with the 2014 fall collection , appointing Martyn Bal as their righthand man . Also , on 24 January 2014 , Gianluca Brozzetti ( CEO ) and Carlo Di Biagio ( COO ) announced they were leaving the fashion brand .
In May 2014 , Cavalli approached Investcorp , an investment firm in the Persian Gulf , as a potential buyer of a stake in their fashion brand .
On March 29 , 2019 , Roberto Cavalli closed its US stores and is preparing to liquidate its North American operations . On the same day the brand announced plans to seek an agreement with creditors in a bid to keep the business afloat while it continues to search for an investor , security guards entered the company 's US stores—including approximately seven full-line stores and a handful of off-price outlets—and instructed employees to leave , according to two salespeople . Employees were told by senior corporate management that the fashion house planned to close its brick-and-mortar stores in the US as the business restructures .
As a result of these changes , several corporate executives , including US CEO Salvatore Tramuto , have resigned . The US corporate team was notified on March 22 that the North American operation , which operates as Art Fashion Corp. , was insolvent and that it would need to close all stores , according to a senior-level executive with direct knowledge of the information .
A Cavalli spokesperson has confirmed that Art Fashion Corp. will file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy—also known as liquidation bankruptcy—in the US this week . E-commerce operations were temporarily shut down until logistics can be re-routed through the European operation , they said . The company 's 93 US employees were terminated on Friday , though they will receive a final paycheck this week , the spokesperson said .
Many leading models have worked for the brand : Jessica Stam , Eva Riccobono , Laetitia Casta , Natasha Poly , Mariacarla Boscono , Karen Elson , Karolina Kurkova and Ivan Olita . amongst others .
In 2019 , DAMAC Properties 's Hussain Sajwani completed the acquisition of Italian fashion group Roberto Cavalli .
Criticism
Cavalli was sharply criticized in 2004 by the Hindu community for marketing a line of feminine underwear ( designed for Harrods ) which featured the images of Hindu goddesses . The line was eventually withdrawn and formal apologies were made .
The Maktab Tarighat Oveyssi Shahmaghsoudi school of Islamic Sufism accused Cavalli of copying their `` sacred emblem '' for branding the Just Cavalli line . The Sufi school brought forth a proceeding in Europe to the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market ( OHIM ) . `` On 16 May 2014 , the OHIM pronounced itself in the first degree rejecting the request made by the School to invalidate the Just Cavalli logo . The Court states that the two logos are not mistakable and do not present any similarities . '' Nonetheless , students of the Sufi school have continued their protest .

Hull Town F.C . was an English association football club from Kingston-upon-Hull in Yorkshire .
History
In 1879 , at the Crown & Cushion Hotel in Hull , members of the Hull Cricket Club agreed to form an association football section to keep the players fit during the winter season . The rules of the new club included a provision that the club would play in amber and black .
Hitherto , Kingston-upon-Hull had been a rugby town ; Hull FC had played a handful of association matches in the 1860s , but otherwise all football in the town was to the oval ball code . Hull Town was the first dedicated association football club in Hull .
Within a couple of years the town had other clubs , and the Scarborough & East Riding Cup final in 1882-83 was played between two of them , Hull losing to Blue Star . In 1883-84 Hull Town merged with Blue Star and the Dairycoates club , and moved ground from the cricket ground on Argyle Street to the Dairycoates ground in Hessle Street . With the extra choice of players , entered the FA Cup for the first time . The club lost 3–1 to Grimsby Town in the first round , and , in 1884-85 , lost again in the first round , at home to Lincoln City , by a score variously reported as being 5-1 or 5–2 , having been ahead at half-time .
After a series of dispiriting defeats , the club disbanded in 1887 . It was reformed a year later but dissolved again at the end of the season .
The name Hull Town was revived in 1896 for a club founded by the rugby side Hull Kingston Rovers , who merged with the Albany club for the purposes of fielding an association football side . The new club reached the final of both the Scarborough & East Riding and Hull Times cups in 1897 , but disappeared in 1898 with other clubs taking on the association mantle .

The Chinese and English Dictionary : Containing All the Words in the Chinese Imperial Dictionary , Arranged According to the Radicals ( 1842 ) , compiled by the English Congregationalist missionary Walter Henry Medhurst ( 1796-1857 ) , is the second major Chinese-English dictionary after Robert Morrison 's pioneering ( 1815-1823 ) A Dictionary of the Chinese Language . Medhurst 's intention was to publish an abridged and cheaper dictionary that still contained all the 47,035 head characters from the ( 1716 ) Kangxi Dictionary , which Morrison 's huge dictionary included . Medhurst reversed and revised into their Chinese-English dictionary in compiling the ( 1847-1848 ) English and Chinese Dictionary in Two Volumes .
History
Walter Henry Medhurst and Robert Morrison were London Missionary Society ( LMS ) colleagues and friends . Both were professional printers , missionaries in China , and amateur lexicographers . In an 1817 letter , Morrison told the LMS directors that Medhurst had sent a promising specimen of small metal types , intended for magazines and tracts , and said the `` qualifications and attention of Mr. M. give us great satisfaction '' . When Morrison was returning to China in 1826 , they met with Medhurst in Java and they discussed their common work .
Medhurst began compiling their dictionary in 1838 , and wrote the LMS missionary printer William Ellis in Tahiti that they planned for their English-Chinese dictionary to include about 15,000 entry words and be `` fit for every purpose of religion and science '' .
As Medhurst explained in an 1841 letter to the LMS directors , their motivation to produce a Chinese and English dictionary came from Morrison 's expensive one , which the missionary school 's students could not afford . They said their `` compendious and cheap '' dictionary would contain `` every character in Morrison 's with all of the useful phrases , in one volume at the moderate cost of a few dollars '' .
Medhurst 's preface says their purpose was to compile a `` commodious , uniform , and comprehensive Dictionary '' for English students of the Chinese language , comprising the 47,035 head characters in the ( 1716 ) Kangxi Dictionary ( `` Imperial Dictionary of Kang-he '' ) , with the exception of those that supposedly have `` either no sound or no meaning attached to them '' . Medhurst initially intended to compile a complete English-Chinese dictionary , but they found that the available materials were insufficient , and it was necessary for them to first create a Chinese-English dictionary , after which the work would be `` comparatively easy to reverse the whole '' , and then add further English terms . Medhurst acknowledges taking phrases from Morrison 's Chinese-English Dictionary and elsewhere , and adopting Morrison 's widely used orthography , with the addition of aspirated consonants and pitch accents or tones , `` as far as they were ascertainable '' .
Chinese-English content
Medhurst printed , at their own expense , their dictionary in 1842 , at Parapattan Batavia , Dutch East Indies .
The 648-page Volume I was completed by October 1842 , and the 838-page Volume II was finished in May 1843 , both were published in 600 copies . Its inexpensive printing enabled Medhurst to sell this bulky dictionary at only 10 Spanish dollars .
As the title says , Medhurst collated their bilingual dictionary by radical-and-stroke sorting according to the 214 Kangxi radicals—the same collation method used in Morrison 's ( 1815-1823 ) Part I Chinese-English dictionary .
Volume I comprise 648 pages of dictionary entries , from Radical 1 一 `` one '' to Radical 111 矢 `` arrow '' , and 50 pages of supplementary materials . The front matter includes an 11-page preface , 3-page list of the radicals , and the 5-page `` Directions for discovering under what Radical any given character may be found '' ; the postface is a 29-page `` List of Obsolete , Contracted , and Vulgar Characters , Not occurring in the foregoing Dictionary Volume I '' . Volume II comprises 838 pages of dictionary entries , from Radical 112 石 `` stone '' to Radical 214 龠 `` flute '' , and a 28-page postface list of uncommon characters not in the volume .
The preface briefly explains to dictionary users , particularly English-speaking students of the Chinese language , Medhurst 's orthography for Standard Chinese phonology .
The dictionary includes 20 initials , and Medhurst adopted Morrison 's method of using apostrophes to represent the unaspirated-aspirated stop consonant pairs ( listen to examples here ) . For instance , this description of the denti-alveolar consonants of unaspirated IPA // and aspirated // ( Wade-Giles t and t ; pinyin d and t ) : `` T , as in top ; and t ' h like the former , only with an aspirate between the t , and following vowel ; not as the th in though , or in thing , but at the same letters in the words at home , supposing the initial a to be left out '' .
The 55 finals are also explained , for example , the rhotic coda or r-colored vowel // , which is difficult for many non-native speakers . `` Urh , is a peculiar sound , something between the r and I , produced by a vibration of the lower part of the tongue against the inward region of the palate , near the entrance of the throat ; it is something similar to the smooth sound of the r , heard in end of English words , as in liar . ''
Medhurst 's dictionary annotates tones in terms of the classical four tones of Middle Chinese pronunciation used in rime dictionaries , instead of the five tones of the 19th-century Southern Mandarin Chinese spoken by Morrison ( 1 `` mid-level '' , 2 `` high rising '' , 3 `` falling '' , 4 `` short '' , and 5 `` rising '' ) . Medhurst indicated píng 平 `` level '' tone as unmarked ( a ) , shǎng 上 `` rising '' tone with grave accent ( à ) , qù 去 `` departing '' tone with acute accent ( á ) , rù 入 '' entering '' tone with short accent ( ӑ ) , and xià píng 下平 `` lower even '' tone with circumflex accent ( â ) . The entering tone had basically ceased to exist by the 1840s in Beijing , but still remained present in Nanjing .
Medhurst adopted Morrison 's dictionary page layout with the page number centered between the character radical number and stroke number : Radical 162 辵 or 辶 `` walk '' and the 9 additional strokes in shǒu 首 `` head '' ( animated 12-stroke order for 道 is shown here ) .
English-Chinese content
The Mission Press in Shanghai published Medhurst 's English and Chinese dictionary in two volumes in 1847 and 1848 , respectively . Publishing 600 copies of this 1,436-page dictionary was the largest work of the mission in its hand-press period .
Owing to Medhurst 's disappointment with the low quality results from combining typography and lithography to print Chinese characters for the Chinese and English Dictionary , they decided to use letterpress printing for the English and Chinese Dictionary , which required the cutting of small type . The LMS had previously used small type to print Christian translations and tracts that were smuggled into China , where they were forbidden . In Shanghai , Medhurst employed Chinese workers to punchcut moveable-type Chinese characters on blank shanks , `` about 15,000 sorts , and nearly 100,000 individual types '' that were required for the dictionary .
For the bilingual sources of their English-Chinese dictionary , Medhurst says they extracted `` all that they thought serviceable from Morrison '' and an anonymous Latin-Chinese manuscript dictionary—presumably the Italian Franciscan Basilio Brollo 's ( 1698 ) Dictionarium Sino-Latinum— '' while they flatter themselves that they have gone far beyond either of their predecessors , in the amount of foreign words adduced , and of expressions brought together to elucidate them . `` .
Volume I ( 1847 ) has a 6-page preface , 2-page summary of orthographic conventions , and the 766-page dictionary proper . The entries begin with `` A , the letter a ; the broad and open sound of this letter is expressed by 亞 a [ yà ] , or 阿 a [ ā ] . '' and end with `` KORAN , the Mahomedans , call the Koran 天經 t'hëen king [ tiānjīng ] . ''
Volume II ( 1848 ) of Medhurst 's English-Chinese dictionary comprises 669 pages . The entries go from `` LABEL , 帖 t'ëĕ [ tiè ] ; the label of a book , 檢 këen [ jiǎn ] . '' To `` ZONE , 帶 taé [ dài ] , 束腰之帶 shǔ yaou che taé [ shùyāo zhī dài ] , 腰帶 yaou taé [ yāodài ] , 地球道 té k'hêu taóu [ dìqiúdào ] . ''
The sample page ( to the right ) contains Medhurst 's dictionary entry for WAY .
Way . 道 Taóu , 路 loó , 庚 käng , 康 k'hang , 彭 p'hang , 疏 sоо , 略路 lëǒ loó , 繇道 yaòu taóu , 道術途 taóu shǔh t'hoô , 街 keae , 街路 keae loó , 迪 teĭh , 逕 king , 途 t'hoô , 坻閣 te kǒ , 道路 taóu loó ; in the way , 途間 t'hoô këen , 路中 loó chung , 街上 keae sháng ; do not go in the way of death , 死路莫行 szè loó mǒ hing ; leave the right way , 離開正路 lê k'hae chíng loó ; public way , 大路 tá loó , 官路 kwan loó ; a great way off , 離遠 lê yuèn ; the way of Providence , 天步 t'ёеп poó ; way to effect an object , 方法 fang fǎ ; manner , 般 pwan , 術 shǔh ; method , 樣法 yang fǎ , 計策 ké tsĭh , 法子 fǎ tszè ; way-marks , 旌節 tsing tsëĕ ; a wayfaring man , 羇旅 ke leù , 路人 loó jin .
The first part of the WAY headword gives 16 translation equivalents of Chinese words meaning `` way '' . This illustrates how one single English headword can have ten or more Chinese translation equivalents , which Medhurst ascribes to either `` the richness of the Chinese language , in certain particulars '' , or to `` the inability of the compiler ( from want of time and skill ) to discover the slight shades of meaning that exist among them '' . Most of these equivalents are common terms , such as 道 taóu ( dào `` way ; road ; path ) , 路 loó ( lù `` road ; path ; way '' ) , and 途 t'hoô ( tú `` road ; route ; way '' ) , but some are obscure classical Chinese terms , such as dǐgé 坻閣 , which the Kangxi zidian ( s.v. , 閣 ) notes was the name of a road mentioned in commentaries to the Rites of Zhou ( 野廬氏 ) . The second part of the WAY headword gives translations of 11 usage examples , for instance , `` public way , 大路 tá loó , 官路 kwan loó '' ( dàlù `` big street ; main road ; highway '' and guānlù `` government-financed road ; public road '' , respectively ) .
Reception
Scholars have expressed diverse opinions of Walter Henry Medhurst 's Chinese-English and English-Chinese dictionaries .
The first published evaluation of the ( 1842-1843 ) Chinese and English Dictionary was an anonymous 1843 review in The Chinese Repository , which was a Protestant missionary periodical published in Canton . On the one hand , the reviewer praises the dictionary 's portability and price , `` two octavo volumes containing 1500 pages for ten dollars '' , but on the other , expresses regret that Medhurst `` has said so little on the subject of tones '' other than `` that they consider them of paramount importance '' .
Based upon comparison of the entries under Radical 46 山 `` mountain '' in Morrison 's and Medhurst 's Chinese-English dictionaries , the reviewer said , `` If Mr. Medhurst does not improve upon himself , they improve vastly upon Dr. Morrison '' .
The next major Chinese-English dictionary after Medhurst 's was the American sinologist and missionary Samuel Wells Williams 's ( 1874 ) A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language . The preface says that although many similar Chinese-English dictionaries by Medhurst , Elijah Coleman Bridgman , and others were published in small numbers , they became `` very scarce , while the number of students has increased tenfold '' , and learners of Chinese relied on reprints of Morrison 's dictionary . Williams explicitly identified `` Dr. Medhurst 's translation of the K'anghi Tsz'tien '' as a more important source for their own work than Morrison 's dictionary .
The preface to the British diplomat and sinologist Herbert Giles 's A Chinese-English Dictionary praised Morrison as `` the great pioneer '' of Chinese and English lexicography , but criticized their failure to mark aspiration . They said Medhurst `` attempted aspirates , but omitted many and wrongly inserted others '' .
Huiling Yang , a researcher at Beijing Foreign Studies University , expresses surprise that the Chinese and English Dictionary , which Medhurst claimed to be their translation based on Kangxi zidian , `` is in fact just an abbreviated and edited copy of Morrison 's , a plagiarism rather than an original compilation '' .

NGC 2359 ( also known as Thor 's Helmet ) is an emission nebula in the constellation Canis Major . The nebula is approximately 3,670 parsecs ( 11.96 thousand light years ) away and 30 light-years in size . The central star is the Wolf-Rayet star WR7 , an extremely hot star thought to be in a brief pre-supernova stage of evolution . It is similar in nature to the Bubble Nebula , but interactions with a nearby large molecular cloud are thought to have contributed to the more complex shape and curved bow-shock structure of Thor 's Helmet .
It is also catalogued as Sharpless 2-298 and Gum 4 .
The nebula has an overall bubble shape , but with complex filamentary structures . The nebula contains several hundred solar masses of ionised material , plus several thousand more of unionised gas . It is largely interstellar material swept up by winds from the central star , although some material does appear to be enriched with the products of fusion and is likely to come directly from the star . The expansion rate of different portions of the nebula varies from 10 km/s to at least 30 km/s , leading to age estimates of 78,500 - 236,000 years . The nebula has been studied at radio and x-ray wavelengths , but it is still unclear whether it was produced at the class O main sequence stage of development , as a red supergiant , luminous blue variable , or mainly as a Wolf-Rayet star .
NGC 2361 is a bright knot of nebulosity on one edge of the central ring of NGC 2359 .

United Nations Security Council resolution 605 , adopted on 22 December 1987 , after hearing from a representative from South Yemen and recalling the Geneva Conventions and Security Council resolutions 446 ( 1979 ) , 465 ( 1980 ) , 497 ( 1981 ) and 592 ( 1986 ) , the Council condemned Israel for violating the human rights of the Palestinian people and in particular the opening of fire and killing of students in the first few weeks of the First Intifada .
The resolution called upon Israel to desist from its policies in the occupied territories and to respect the Fourth Geneva Convention , urging maximum restraint to contribute towards the establishment of peace in the region . It also stressed the urgent need to reach a just , durable and peaceful settlement of the Arab–Israeli conflict as a whole .
The resolution requested the Secretary-General to examine the present situation and recommend ways for ensuring the safety and protection of the Palestinian civilians under occupation and to report back no later than 20 January 1988 .
Text of the resolution
Votes
The resolution was adopted by 14 votes to none against , with one abstention from the United States , which did so due to its `` generalised criticism of Israeli policies and practices '' while ignoring Arab provocations which led to the incident .

USS Zaca ( IX-73 ) is a wooden-hulled , schooner-rigged yacht with an auxiliary engine .
History
They were commissioned by the self proclaimed explorer , Charles Templeton Crocker , to a design of Garland Rotch , and built by Nunes Brothers Boat and Ways Co. as a vessel for sailing around the world with all the modern conveniences of the time . When their new boat was completed in 1930 at Sausalito , California , Crocker wasted no time in making full use of it , spending the 1930s sailing the Zaca around the world on various expeditions , primarily in the name of scientific discovery and on behalf of the California Academy of Sciences , where many of their records sit now . From the Palmyra Atoll to the Galapagos , Crocker collected and documented plant and animal life with a small crew of scientists and artists , including noted photographer and Japanese artist , Toshio Asaeda .
World War II
Due to the need for local patrol and rescue craft in the busy waters in the San Francisco area during World War II , the schooner was acquired by the Navy from Templeton Crocker on 12 June 1942 . Placed in service on 19 June 1942 and assigned to the Western Sea Frontier , Zaca was classified a miscellaneous auxiliary and designated IX-73 . They were the second ship of that name to serve in the US Navy , and operated as a plane-guard ship , standing ready to rescue the crews of any planes downed nearby .
Eventually relieved by the frigates ( PF 's ) of Escort Squadron 41 , Zaca was placed out of service at Treasure Island , California on 6 October 1944 ; and their name was struck from the Navy list on 13 November 1944 .
Errol Flynn
Turned over to the War Shipping Administration on 21 May 1945 , Zaca was acquired in 1946 by Errol Flynn , an actor famed for their `` swashbuckling '' roles in numerous movies . Zaca is featured prominently in the 1947 Orson Welles film The Lady from Shanghai . A documentary short film Cruise Of The Zaca which features Flynn and their father Theodore Thomson Flynn , an eminent marine biologist , collecting marine samples in the semi-tropics , was made in 1952 and has been shown on the Turner Classic Movies TV channel . Flynn owned the yacht until their death in 1959 .
Today
As of 2008 , Zaca is privately owned by Roberto Memmo and berthed in Monaco . A skipper and crew of four regularly sail Zaca to ports such as Punta Ala , Gaeta , Capri , Cagliari , and throughout the Aegean Sea . The Zaca is frequently seen at prestigious sailing races in the Mediterranean . Them winter port is in Port de Fontvieille , Monaco . In 2009 , the Sailing Channel ( now the Nautical Channel ) dedicated a program to the entire history of the Zaca from original construction to the present entitled `` In the Wake of the Zaca '' .

`` A new style of Latina and Latino hip-hop was created in Miami and Texas by the bass rappers DJ Laz and Jonny Z , who mixed Latin styles with bass music '' .... Besides bass music , they also recorded some funk-influenced hip hop on their earlier albums . Among those early tracks , the Chicano anthem `` Orale '' . They also are the first Latino American to incorporate not only Spanglish in their raps , but more explicit words and phrases . Words like `` Culo '' and `` Nalgas '' , and `` Chones '' . Phrases like `` Vamos a la cama '' , and `` Se me Paro '' . This opened the door of acceptability at radio stations across the U.S . They were truly the original Latin rap rebel .

Type 2 inflammation is a pattern of immune response . Its physiological function is to defend the body against helminths , but a dysregulation of the type 2 inflammatory response has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several diseases .
Molecular biology
IL-25 , IL-33 , and TSLP are alarmins released from damaged epithelial cells . These cytokines mediate the activation of type 2 T helper cells ( Th2 cells ) , type 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2 cells ) , and dendritic cells . Th2 cells and ILC2 cells secrete IL-4 , IL-5 and IL-13 .
IL-4 further drives CD4+ T cell differentiation towards the Th2 subtype and induces isotype switching to IgE in B cells . IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate trafficking of eosinophils to the site of inflammation , while IL-5 promotes both eosinophil trafficking and production .
Dysregulation in human disease
Type 2 inflammation has been implicated in several chronic diseases :
Asthma
Atopic dermatitis
Chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps
Eosinophilic esophagitis
Persons with one type 2 inflammatory disease are more likely to have other type 2 inflammatory diseases .
Pharmacological targets
Several medicines have been developed that target mediators of type 2 inflammation :
IL-4-specific blockers :
Altrakincept
Pascolizumab
IL-5-specific blockers :
Benralizumab
Mepolizumab
Reslizumab
IL-13-specific blockers :
Lebrikizumab
Tralokinumab
Dual IL-4 and IL-13 blockers :
Dupilumab
IgE-blockers :
Ligelizumab
Omalizumab

Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase ( Rpi ) encoded by the RPIA gene is an enzyme ( ) that catalyzes the conversion between ribose-5-phosphate ( R5P ) and ribulose-5-phosphate ( Ru5P ) . It is a member of a larger class of isomerases which catalyze the interconversion of chemical isomers ( in this case structural isomers of pentose ) . It plays a vital role in biochemical metabolism in both the pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin cycle . The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-ribose-5-phosphate aldose-ketose-isomerase .
Structure
Gene
RpiA in human beings is encoded on the second chromosome on the short arm ( p arm ) at position 11.2 . Its encoding sequence is nearly 60,000 base pairs long . The only known naturally occurring genetic mutation results in ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency , discussed below . The enzyme is thought to have been present for most of evolutionary history . Knock-out experiments conducted on the genes of various species meant to encode RpiA have indicated similar conserved residues and structural motifs , indicating ancient origins of the gene .
Protein
Rpi exists as two distinct proteins , termed RpiA and RpiB . Although RpiA and RpiB catalyze the same reaction , they show no sequence or overall structural homology . According to Jung et al. , an assessment of RpiA using SDS-PAGE shows that the enzyme is a homodimer of 25 kDa subunits . The molecular mass of the RpiA dimer was found to be 49 kDa by gel filtration . Recently , the crystal structure of RpiA was determined . ( please see http : //www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/97516673/PDFSTAR )
Due to its role in the pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin cycle , RpiA is highly conserved in most organisms , such as bacteria , plants , and animals . RpiA plays an essential role in the metabolism of plants and animals , as it is involved in the Calvin cycle which takes place in plants , and the pentose phosphate pathway which takes place in plants as well as animals .
All orthologs of the enzyme maintain an asymmetric tetramer quaternary structure with a cleft containing the active site . Each subunit consists of a five stranded β-sheet . These β-sheets are surrounded on both sides by α-helices . This αβα motif is not uncommon in other proteins , suggesting possible homology with other enzymes . The separate molecules of the enzyme are held together by highly polar contacts on the external surfaces of the monomers . It is presumed that the active site is located where multiple β-sheet C termini come together in the enzymatic cleft . This cleft is capable of closing upon recognition of the phosphate on the pentose ( or an appropriate phosphate inhibitor ) . The active site is known to contain conserved residues equivalent to the E. coli residues Asp81 , Asp84 , and Lys94 . These are directly involved in catalysis .
Mechanism
In the reaction , the overall consequence is the movement of a carbonyl group from carbon number 1 to carbon number 2 ; this is achieved by the reaction going through an enediol intermediate ( Figure 1 ) . Through site-directed mutagenesis , Asp87 of spinach RpiA was suggested to play the role of a general base in the interconversion of R5P to Ru5P .
The first step in the catalysis is the docking of the pentose into the active site in the enzymatic cleft , followed by allosteric closing of the cleft . The enzyme is capable of bonding with the open-chain or ring form of the sugar-phosphate . If it does bind the furanose ring , it next opens the ring . Then the enzyme forms the eneldiol which is stabilized by a lysine or arginine residue . Calculations have demonstrated that this stabilization is the most significant contributor to the overall catalytic activity of this isomerase and a number of others like it .
Function
The protein encoded by RPIA gene is an enzyme , which catalyzes the reversible conversion between ribose-5-phosphate and ribulose-5-phosphate in the pentose-phosphate pathway . This gene is highly conserved in most organisms . The enzyme plays an essential role in the carbohydrate metabolism . Mutations in this gene cause ribose 5-phosphate isomerase deficiency . A pseudogene is found on chromosome 18 .
Pentose phosphate pathway
In the non-oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway , RPIA converts Ru5P to R5P which then is converted by ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase to xylulose-5-phosphate ( figure 3 ) . The end result of the reaction essentially is the conversion of the pentose phosphates to intermediates used in the glycolytic pathway . In the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway , RpiA converts Ru5P to the final product , R5P through the isomerization reaction ( figure 3 ) . The oxidative branch of the pathway is a major source for NADPH which is needed for biosynthetic reactions and protection against reactive oxygen species .
Calvin cycle
In the Calvin cycle , the energy from the electron carriers is used in carbon fixation , the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates . RPIA is essential in the cycle , as Ru5P generated from R5P is subsequently converted to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate ( RuBP ) , the acceptor of carbon dioxide in the first dark reaction of photosynthesis ( Figure 3 ) . The direct product of RuBP carboxylase reaction is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ; these are subsequently used to make larger carbohydrates . Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is converted to glucose which is later converted by the plant to storage forms ( e.g. , starch or cellulose ) or used for energy .
Clinical significance
Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency is mutated in a rare disorder , Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency . The disease has only one known affected patient , diagnosed in 1999 . It has been found to be caused by a combination of two mutations . The first is an insertion of a premature stop codon into the gene encoding the isomerase , and the second is a missense mutation . The molecular pathology is , as yet , unclear .
RpiA and hepatocarcinogenesis
Human ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A ( RpiA ) plays a role in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . A significant increase in RpiA expression was detected both in tumor biopsies of HCC patients and in a liver cancer tissue array . Importantly , the clinicopathological analysis indicated that RpiA mRNA levels were highly correlated with clinical stage , grade , tumor size , types , invasion and alpha-fetoprotein levels in the HCC patients . In addition , the ability of RpiA to regulate cell proliferation and colony formation in different liver cancer cell lines required ERK signaling as well as the negative modulation of PP2A activity and that the effects of RpiA could be modulated by the addition of either a PP2A inhibitor or activator . It suggests that RpiA overexpression can induce oncogenesis in HCC .
RpiA and the malaria parasite
RpiA generated attention when the enzyme was found to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum , the causative agent of malaria . Plasmodium cells have a critical need for a large supply of the reducing power of NADPH via PPP in order to support their rapid growth . The need for NADPH is also required to detoxify heme , the product of hemoglobin degradation .
Furthermore , Plasmodium has an intense requirement for nucleic acid production to support its rapid proliferation . The R5P produced via increased pentose phosphate pathway activity is used to generate 5-phospho-D-ribose α-1-pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) needed for nucleic acid synthesis . It has been shown that PRPP concentrations are increased 56-fold in infected erythrocytes compared with uninfected erythrocytes . Hence , designing drugs that target RpiA in Plasmodium falciparum could have therapeutic potential for patients that suffer from malaria .
Interactions
RPIA has been shown to interact with PP2A .

Ales Prudnikau ( April 14 , 1910 – August 5 , 1941 ) was a Belarusian poet . They were a cousin of another Belarusian writer , Pavel Prudnikau .
Biography
Ales Prudnikau was born into a peasant family . Their father Traphim was called to the front at the time of World War I , they were badly injured and died soon after . Because of the unstable situation Ales could n't find a constant place tor study for a long time . In 1924-1930 they were studying in the seven-years school in the village Miloslavicy . In 1930 they worked on the building of the railway Asipovichy - Mahilyow - Roslavl , then in 1931 they worked in Minsk ( in editory , in Belarusin Telegraph Agency ) . In 1932-1933 they were studying at the creative department of the Minsk pedagogical institute . In March 1933 they were arrested but after eight months was liberated and was called up to the Red Army , where they served until 1935 . In 1935-1936 they worked on the local Klimovichy newspaper `` Kamuna '' . In 1938 they graduated from the Leningrad pedagogical institute . They worked as the teacher , then as inspector of the Petrovo ( now Kondopoga ) raion of Karelian ASSR ( in 1940-1956 - the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic ) , at the same time was studying at the philological faculty of the Karelian University . Since the first days of the German invasion of the Soviet Union , they were an intelligence operator at the front . They were killed on August 5 , 1941 near the village Utuki of Kondopoga raion . They were rehabilitated in 1956 .
Creative activity
Ales Prudnikau began their creative activity as a school poet together with their cousin Pavel Prudnikau in 1926 . The time of their studying coincided with the process of belarusization in BSSR , so if they began to write their verses in Belarusian . At the same time they were an informal correspondent for some newspapers . For example , after a treasure of ancient coins had been found in the village Stary Dzedzin , they wrote a report to the newspaper `` Belarusian village '' ( ) together with Pavel . ( For more information , look an article Stary Dzedzin ) . Their first verses were published in 1930 . In 1932 they wrote a poem `` Stars of the Earth '' ( ) which was published as a book where they told about buildings of the first five-year plan . Some of their verses were published in the book `` With the Blood of the Heart '' ( , 1967 ) .

Belinda Nana Ekua Amoah ( born 26 December 1979 ) , popularly known as Mzbel , is a Ghanaian Hiplife artist .
Early life and education
Amoah was born on boxing day , 26 December 1979 , to Albert A. Amoah , an engineer and Agnes Nyarko . They are the last of seven female children .
Growing up in James Town , they attended the God Wisdom Preparatory schools , and continued to Korle Gonno 1 and Owusu Mills ' JHS at Mamprobi [ a suburb of Accra ] for their Junior High School Education . Mzbel has admitted they took to skin bleaching in their teen years because it was the norm in Jamestown
Mzbel then continued to pursue Secondary education at the Abuakwa State College . They studied general arts majoring in economics , geography and French . They then applied to study at the Ghana Institute of Languages , and trained to become a bilingual secretary .
While at the institute , they got wave of the fact that the Manifold Tutorial College was offering a one-year course in television production and enrolled , combining it with their course at the Institute of Languages , and studied public relations , television , and radio production .
Music career
After their course at the GIL and a stint with Manifold Tutorial College , they earned an internship slot with GBC Radio 1 where they hosted a children 's programme `` Mmofra Kyepem '' . From GBC Radio 1 they joined Groove FM , [ now Adom FM ] , as an intern and co - hosted a child focused programme titled ‘ Kids on Groove ' .
Haven worked with Groove FM for a while , the pursuit of higher laurels led Mzbel to TV3 as a production assistant for one of the station 's youth centered programmes known as Goldblast . They worked also as floor manager for same and also as a production assistant for another programme `` Talking Drum '' .
In the year 2002 , Mzbel had the opportunity to work with Hush Hush Studios , which at that time had come on the scene as a new production firm . While at Hush Hush , they sometimes would be asked into the studio , and as the technicians played their instruments , they sang along , songs they had created . These were songs they would usually sing to themselves with no serious intention of pursuing a music career . While working part - time at Hush Hush Studios , they secured another job , at Metro TV as the only digital video editor and also producer for 'Smash TV ' , a weekend entertainment programme .
From Metro TV they were employed by Apex Advertising as a video editor and production manager . They had to combine Music and their job roles at Apex , and when they found the two overly demanding , Mzbel chose to give the music the full span of their attention . Over time , they have been criticized for their choice of clothes which have been described as `` sexy '' or `` skimpy '' . in their own words , Mzbel believes however that as an artiste you must look unique . They have always had the ambition to be a source of inspiration to the underprivileged and to be able to help the down trodden .

`` Os '' is the 16th episode of the third season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe , and the 59th episode overall . The episode centered on the Fringe team 's investigation into a series of robberies of the element osmium , which they connect to a scientist ( Alan Ruck ) who is able to defy the laws of physics .
`` Os '' was written by Josh Singer and Graham Roland , while Brad Anderson served as director . Along with Ruck , the episode also guest-starred Jorge Garcia in a brief cameo as a security guard .
On its first broadcast in the United States on March 11 , 2011 , an estimated 3.76 million viewers tuned in , giving it a 1.5/5 ratings share for those between the ages 18–49 . Critical reception to the episode was generally positive , as multiple critics noted that Ruck was well-cast as a scientist just trying to help their son .
Plot
The Fringe team is called to the scene of a robbery of a metal depository ; the body of one of the thieves , shot by a security guard , inexplicably floats off the ground , while a second culprit has gotten away . They find that the thief has taken off with a supply of osmium , one of the densest elements , and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief 's body is filled with the metal . Tracking a security card on the body , they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit , dead , along with the bodies of several more people , all of them paraplegic . Walter ( John Noble ) notes that the physical properties of osmium ( both gravitational and thermal ) have been reversed , and by melting the osmium collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen , they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium , typically only present in meteorites .
Recognizing that the local science museum has a display of meteorites , the Fringe team is able to secure Dr. Crick ( Alan Ruck ) , the man behind the osmium injections , and another paraplegic who has taken Dr. Crick 's injections as they attempt to steal the display . With Dr. Crick in custody , Walter learns that the man had worked in aerospace to find an alloy for fighter craft . They happened upon the combination of the osmium-lutetium alloy that generated a material lighter than air , and sought to refine a permanent solution to give their own paraplegic son the ability to walk , having promised the same to those that had died from earlier , lethal doses of the alloy .
Walter , who has lamented to Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ) their need to have William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) back to make themselves whole , realizes that the only reason the osmium-lutetium alloy became lighter than air was due to their own transgression into the parallel universe that has started to break down the laws of reality . To reverse those effects , Walter intends to use the idea of `` soul magnets '' , microscopic devices that can be ingested by a person to call forth the soul of another . Walter believes Bell had arranged for someone in the prime universe to be their vessel , and rings the bell that Bell had bequeathed to Nina , believing it to be the instrument that will activate the soul magnets and call forth Bell .
Simultaneously , Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) has decided to open up to Olivia ( Anna Torv ) and shows them the five data discs from the shapeshifters they killed after the doomsday device weaponized him . As they discuss it with her , Olivia hears the sound of the bell . They turn to face Peter , revealing themselves to now be possessed by Bell .
Production
The episode was co-written by co-executive producer Josh Singer and executive story editor Graham Roland , while former Fringe producer Brad Anderson directed it .
The return of the William Bell character to the series was inspired by Leonard Nimoy from earlier seasons . In their first appearance on Fringe in the first season finale , `` There 's More Than One of Everything '' , Nimoy requested that a bell be placed on their desk so that their character would be able to ring it as a play on the character 's name . When the writers considered how to bring Bell back for the third season , they recalled this mannerism , and wrote it into the larger mythos , being the means by which Bell 's mind emerged from Olivia 's at the end of this episode .
On March 3 , Entertainment Weekly reported that actor Jorge Garcia would be making a cameo appearance in an upcoming Fringe episode . Garcia , who previously starred as Hugo `` Hurley '' Reyes from J.J. Abrams ' Lost , appears as a Massive Dynamic guard that is smoking a bong with Walter at the start of the episode . Alan Ruck guests as Dr. Crick , the person behind the floating bodies . Ruck was approached by the show 's producers having envisioned them for the role . Ruck described the character , `` He is no dummy ... and they stumbled on to something and they are trying to figure out a way to use it . Ultimately they would like to use it for good , but in so doing they cause a lot of damage . So I guess you can say he 's obsessed . And this particular point in time where the episode of Fringe starts , time is fleeting and he 's just ... under the gun . '' On their character 's possible reappearance , Ruck commented , `` I think not ... Technically yes [ he could come back ] , but probably not . ''
As with other Fringe episodes , Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children , focusing on the science seen in `` Os '' , with the intention of having `` students learn about meteorites and ways of finding them . ''
Reception
Ratings
On its first broadcast , `` Os '' maintained a 1.5/5 rating share for adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as with several previous episodes , with an estimated 3.76 million viewers . In the 18–49 demographic , Fringe was the second most watched show in its time slot , after CSI : NY . Time shifted viewing increased the episode 's ratings among adults by 53 percent to a 2.3 ratings share . This was the largest increase in time shifting viewing for the week among network shows .
Reviews
Reviews of the episode were generally positive . Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly praised guest actor Alan Ruck 's `` sustained , understated '' performance , and also called Olivia being revealed as Bell 's vessel `` a clever development , '' especially praising actor Anna Torv 's imitation of Nimoy 's voice rather than `` doing the obvious thing and hav [ ing ] their lip-synch Nimoy reading the lines . '' The A.V . Club 's Emily VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B− , explaining that unlike Tucker , they thought the idea of `` soul magnets '' was `` just so goofy that it 's almost too much for me to handle '' . VanDerWerff also felt there was n't much of a connection between the episode and the ongoing storyline `` until the show tries to force one in a way that does n't feel as elegant as the show usually makes this stuff feel '' . They did however praise Ruck as `` well-cast , '' and wrote the episode `` very nearly managed '' to parallel Walter 's `` desperate measures to the desperate measures of other men also trying to save themselves or their children through science , '' which the reviewer considered the strongest asset of the show .
Writing for the Los Angeles Times , critic Andrew Hanson referred to audiences ' Friday night plans away from television when they commented the episode was `` better than any movie you 're going to see in the theater right now '' . Hanson thought the mystery produced `` surprises around every corner '' . IGN 's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10 , explaining they enjoyed the `` classic Fringe '' opening scene , the `` decent [ acting ] job '' by Ruck , and John Noble 's performance ; they also thought the script was `` very clever [ as ] it reveals surprising story elements with innovative tricks '' . Isler was n't sure what to make of the Bell-Olivia plot twist however , commenting that `` this new William Bell thing is either going to end up as the best plot device of the season , or the cheesiest thing in recent sci-fi history '' .
Billy Grifter from Den of Geek was slightly disappointed with the `` mad scientist '' storyline as they felt it had been done before , but found several redeeming qualities : Alan Ruck 's performance and the last five minutes featuring Noble and Blair Brown , and Torv with Joshua Jackson . Grifter thought the Noble-Brown scene was `` actually very funny , '' praising the two actors ' performances , and added that this humor made the following Torv-Jackson scene 's impact `` even greater '' . Referring to Torv 's `` passable '' Nimoy impression , Grifter concluded that `` the strength of Fringe is that it can take a rather light and fluffy premise , like the one in `` Os '' , and embellish it with wonderful character moments and a genuine surprise or two '' .

`` 7+3 '' in the context of chemotherapy is an acronym for a chemotherapy regimen that is most often used today ( as of 2014 ) as first-line induction therapy ( to induce remission ) in acute myelogenous leukemia , excluding the acute promyelocytic leukemia form , which is better treated with ATRA and/or arsenic trioxide and requires less chemotherapy ( if requires it at all , which is not always the case ) .
The name `` 7+3 '' comes from the duration of chemotherapy course , which consists of 7 days of standard-dose cytarabine , and 3 days of an anthracycline antibiotic or an anthracenedione , most often daunorubicin ( can be substituted for doxorubicin or idarubicin or mitoxantrone ) .
Dosing regimen
Standard-dose cytarabine plus daunorubicin ( DA or DAC chemotherapy )
Standard-dose cytarabine plus idarubicin ( IA or IAC chemotherapy )
Standard-dose cytarabine plus mitoxantrone ( MA or MAC chemotherapy )
Intensified versions
There were attempts to intensify the `` 7+3 '' regimen in order to try to improve its efficacy . Attempts were made to prolong the course ( cytarabine for 10 days instead of 7 , or daunorubicin/idarubicin for 4–5 days instead of 3 ) .
On the other hand , there were attempts to minimize the toxicity of the regimen by reducing the dose or the duration of the course . But this proved to compromise the efficacy of the regimen .
The addition of vinca alkaloids ( vincristine or vinblastine ) to the `` 7+3 '' regimen , which addition was quite popular in AML ( ALL ? ) in old times ( when the biology of AML and the differences between AML and ALL was poorly understood ) proved to be harmful in AML , lowering the chance of the patient to get remission . This is because vinca alkaloids are rapidly deactivated in myeloid cells by their enzyme myeloperoxidase . So the vinca alkaloids do much more damage to the lymphoid cell lines ( including the T-cell lines responsible for antileukemic immunity ) than to the myeloid cell lines . Moreover , vinca alkaloids in the context of AML cause AML cells to undergo a cell cycle arrest in the phase that renders those cells less sensitive to cytarabine and anthracyclines .
Addition of glucocorticoids ( like prednisolone ) or methotrexate or alkylating drugs ( like cyclophosphamide or melphalan ) to the `` 7+3 '' regimen is also of no benefit in AML .
The addition of etoposide to the standard `` 7+3 '' regimen is sometimes of benefit in poor-risk patients ( many of which are primary refractory to standard `` 7+3 '' induction regimens ) . It gave rise to the so-called ADE ( or DAE = DA + etoposide ) induction regimen in AML . The ADE induction ( unlike , say , combinations of 7+3 with vinca alkaloids or prednisolone ) is still sometimes used , especially in poor-risk AML patients .
The addition of 6-thioguanine gave rise to the DAT regimen , and the addition of 6-mercaptopurine gave rise to the DAM regimen .

The 1626 Lingqiu earthquake had an epicenter in Lingqiu County , Shanxi Province during the Qing dynasty . The estimated surface wave magnitude ( ) 7.0 earthquake caused many buildings to collapse . Over 5,200 people were killed .
Tectonic setting
The Shanxi Rift System is a seismically active intracontinental rift zone in North China . Since 231 BC , eight 7.0 earthquakes have occurred along the rift system . The 1303 Hongdong , 1556 Shanxi , and 1695 Linfen earthquakes were the deadliest associated with the rift , with death tolls of 50,000 to 830,000 respectively .
Bounded to the west by the Lüliang Mountains , and the east by the Taihang Mountains , the Shanxi Rift forms the eastern boundary of the Ordos Block ; a fragment of continental crust within the Eurasian Plate . Within the rift features half-grabens . It formed when extension began in the Miocene or Pliocene , separating the crust into the Ordos Block from the North China Craton . The reason for extension in this part of China is still debated although the most agreed hypothesis is crustal deformation resulting from the India-Asia collision involving the Indian and Eurasian plates along the Main Himalayan Thrust in the Himalayas , causing the rotation of crustal blocks in China . Other hypotheses are slab rollback of the Pacific Plate as it subducts along the east coast of Japan , or localized intraplate tectonics .
Dip-slip and strike-slip earthquakes in North China are consistent with ongoing crustal extension along the Shanxi Rift System . The rift extends for 1,200 km , and is up to 60 km wide . The graben is bounded by normal faults on both sides capable of generating earthquakes . Extension along the rift zone occur at a slow rate of 0.8 ± 0.3 mm/year , therefore earthquakes occur with long intervals of recurrence . The estimated magnitudes of earthquakes by Chinese researchers previously have possible inaccuracies as they are based on written descriptions and death toll from the earthquakes .
Earthquake
The earthquake rupture involved two conjugated faults ; the Shuijian–Luoshuihe Fault , and the Huashanhe Fault . The Shuijian–Luoshuihe Fault is located west of Lingqiu County , where is strikes in a north-northeast direction . A one-meter-high fault scarp is visible on the surface , corresponding to the 1626 earthquake . Both faults have shallow dipping angles in the east and west direction , and have a normal slip sense . It has an estimated magnitude of 7.0 and China seismic intensity scale rating of IX ( Destructive ) .
In another study , the earthquake is proposed to have occurred in the Fenwei Graben System along a strike-slip fault . The rupture is estimated at 134.13 km by 26 km , with an epicenter located at , and a hypocenter depth of 7.5 km beneath the surface .
Damage
At Lingqiu , many homes belonging to officials and civillains were destroyed . Liquefaction events occurred ; black water erupted from dry wells . More than 5,200 people died in the county . About 80–90 % of government offices , homes , and warehouses collapsed in Hunyuan County . Much of the city walls fell . Additional buildings and structures were left in ruins at Yuxian , and Laiyuan . It was felt in the provinces of Shandong , Hebei , and Henan . The shaking was also felt in Beijing .

Mark Wynter ( born Terence Sidney Lewis ; 29 January 1943 ) is an English singer and actor , who had four Top 20 singles in the 1960s , including `` Venus in Blue Jeans '' and `` Go Away Little Girl '' . They enjoyed a lengthy career from 1960 to 1968 as a pop singer and teen idol , and developed later into an actor in film , musicals and plays .
Career
With their early musical career on a proper footing , Terry Lewis decided to change their name to lessen the confusion with the American comedian , Jerry Lewis .
They were entered as one of the contenders for the UK 's place in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1961 , with `` Dream Girl '' , but finished fourth behind The Allisons .
Their cover version of the American hit by Jimmy Clanton , `` Venus in Blue Jeans '' ( 1962 ) , was their biggest success . Although they recorded a number of singles for the Decca and Pye labels in the UK , they made few albums . Some recorded material came to light in 2004 when Wynter discovered old tapes .
On 8 April 1968 Wynter escaped from a burning Boeing 707 aircraft , BOAC Flight 712 , upon which they had been a passenger , and which had exploded shortly after landing back at Heathrow Airport following a fire in its number 2 engine , killing five people , including flight attendantess Barbara Jane Harrison , who was posthumously awarded the George Cross .
Wynter played the leading role in Conduct Unbecoming for more than a year at the Queen 's Theatre in London , and for six months in Australia . They appeared with Julia McKenzie in On the Twentieth Century , and in Charley 's Aunt . They also starred in Side By Sondheim in Toronto , Chichester , and on the UK tour . In the 1982 Chichester Festival season they acted in several plays including On The Rocks and Henry V , and also sang in Valmouth . Their other work in musicals during the 1980s included the role of the King in a revival of The King and me , the title roles in Hans Andersen and Barnum , the 1986 revival of Charlie Girl with Cyd Charisse and Paul Nicholas in London , and the part of Robert Browning in Robert and Elizabeth . During the 1990s Wynter spent two years in Cats , and was also seen as the Phantom and M. Andre in The Phantom of the Opera , and starred as Vittorio opposite Bonnie Langford in the 1998 West End revival of Sweet Charity . They have appeared frequently in the rest of the UK and portrayed Emile de Becque in a UK national tour of South Pacific . In 1994 they created the role of Van Helsing in the studio recording of the opera/musical `` Nosferatu '' by Bernard J. Taylor .
In 1981 they succeeded Peter Davison as the presenter of the children 's television series Once Upon a Time . During the early 1990s they presented daytime shows on BBC Radio 2 , as well as documentaries such as `` Happy Times '' , a programme about the American entertainer Danny Kaye , which was nominated for a New York radio award .
Wynter was still working actively and successfully in theatre throughout the English speaking world well into the 1990s . Although their Decca singles output is scattered in the CD catalogue , in 2000 Castle Communications released Go Away Little Girl : The Pye Anthology , a double album compiling their complete output for the label . In 2007 , Wynter toured the UK in a number of plays and musicals .
In 2017 , Wynter went on a UK tour with The Solid Gold Rock'n'Roll Show , which also featured Eden Kane , Marty Wilde and Mike Berry . A 2021 tour is currently scheduled .
Personal life
Wynter now lives in Sussex , and tours in plays for producer Bill Kenwright , pop tours for The Flying Music Company . A triple CD of their back catalogue was issued in 2017 . They are married to Emma , and has three children .

The TNA Television Championship was a professional wrestling championship owned by the promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA , now Impact Wrestling ) . It was introduced on the October 23 , 2008 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! as the TNA Legends Championship . It was later known as the TNA Global Championship and the TNA King of the Mountain Championship . The title appeared in Global Force Wrestling ( GFW ) , during a talent exchange partnership .
As a professional wrestling championship , it was won via a planned ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline . All title changes occurred at TNA-promoted events . Reigns that occurred on TNA Impact ! , or its later title Impact Wrestling , usually aired on tape delay . The first champion was Booker T. The final champion was Lashley , as the title was retired on August 12 , 2016 . There were a total of 25 reigns among 19 wrestlers .
History
The title was introduced during a storyline that pitted The TNA Front Line against The Main Event Mafia . In the weeks leading up to the unveiling of the physical belt , Booker T carried around a steel briefcase . On the October 23 , 2008 , episode of Impact ! , Booker T introduced the belt by removing it from the briefcase , announcing its name as the `` TNA Legends Championship '' , and declaring themselves the first champion . They went on to state that the championship was theirs and that they would defend it when they saw fit ; this meant that the championship was unsanctioned by TNA in the storyline .
On March 15 , 2009 , at TNA 's Destination X pay-per-view ( PPV ) event , AJ Styles defeated Booker T to win the championship . Afterwards on the March 19 , 2009 , episode of Impact ! , Styles was credited as becoming the first-ever TNA Grand Slam Champion , by winning the World Heavyweight ( NWA or TNA ) , the World Tag Team ( NWA or TNA ) , the TNA X Division Championship , and the Legends Championship . TNA Management Director Jim Cornette then announced that the TNA Legends Championship had become an official TNA sanctioned championship thanks to Styles defeating Booker T for it legally via the contract the two had signed to make the match official .
On the October 29 , 2009 , episode of Impact ! , then-champion Eric Young renamed the title the `` TNA Global Championship '' . They went on to declare that they were not going to defend it against any American wrestlers nor on American soil . However , Young 's first defense was on the December 10 , 2009 , episode of Impact ! in Orlando , Florida against Japanese female wrestler Hamada . Young 's second , third and fourth defenses lived up to their earlier decree , when they defended against Suicide in Glasgow , Hamada in Bournemouth , and unsuccessfully against Welsh wrestler Rob Terry in Cardiff , Wales at a live event on January 27 , 2010 . On the July 22 , 2010 , episode of Impact ! , Terry lost the Global Championship to AJ Styles . Styles then renamed the title the `` TNA Television Championship '' on the July 29 , 2010 , episode of Impact ! .
On the April 19 , 2012 , episode of the newly titled Impact Wrestling , TNA General Manager Hulk Hogan ordered that the TNA Television Championship had to be defended every week . The weekly title defenses lasted until the June 21 , 2012 , episode of Impact Wrestling .
On July 3 , 2014 , TNA Executive Director Kurt Angle declared the championship inactive . The title was reactivated on June 25 , 2015 , by TNA under the new name of the `` TNA King of the Mountain Championship . '' TNA announced that a new champion would be determined in a King of the Mountain match at their Slammiversary PPV event on June 28 . Jeff Jarrett defeated Matt Hardy , Eric Young , Drew Galloway , and Bobby Roode to win the championship . The title ended up appearing in GFW at a July 9 live event where Young attacked Jarrett and stole the championship belt .
During the August 18 , 2016 , taping of Impact Wrestling , it was announced that the King of the Mountain Championship was vacated , deactivated and retired with announcement of a new title , the Impact Grand Championship .
Reigns
The inaugural champion was Booker T , who awarded the championship to themselves on the October 23 , 2008 , episode of Impact ! . Eric Young holds the record for most reigns , with three , and is the only wrestler to hold the title under all four of its incarnations . Abyss ' second reign is the longest in the title 's history at 396 days . P. J . Black and Lashley share the record for shortest reign in the title 's history at one day . Abyss holds the record for combined days as champion , with 460 . Lashley was the final champion , having defeated James Storm for the championship with their X Division and World Heavyweight Championships on the line , and unifying the title with their World Title , thus retiring the King of the Mountain Championship in the process .
Overall , there have been 25 reigns shared among 19 wrestlers , with three vacancies and two deactivations .

In June 2017 Lipa released their eponymous debut studio album , which reached the top 10 charts in Australia , Belgium , Ireland , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Sweden and the United Kingdom . The album 's chart-topping hits `` Be the One '' , `` New Rules '' and `` IDGAF '' propelled Lipa to international fame .
`` New Rules '' was Lipa 's first number one single in the UK ; the charity single `` Bridge over Troubled Water '' , dedicated to victims of the Grenfell Tower fire , on which Lipa performed and also topped the UK Singles Chart . They reissued their album in 2018 as Dua Lipa : Complete Edition , inserting several of their already released collaborations—including `` One Kiss '' with Calvin Harris , a song which spent eight weeks atop the UK Singles Chart .
In March 2020 , Lipa released their second studio album , Future Nostalgia . Later , they supported the album with the release of its remix album Club Future Nostalgia , a collaboration with the Blessed Madonna , and with its reissue Future Nostalgia : The Moonlight Edition . Future Nostalgia reached number one in Australia , Ireland , the Netherlands , New Zealand and the UK . Its lead single `` Do n't Start Now '' was a commercial success , reaching the top 10 in several international markets and number one in Ireland . On the UK Singles Chart , the song became the longest top 10 stay for a British female artist and the longest top 10 stay without reaching the summit in that chart 's history . In April 2020 , the song alongside follow-up singles `` Physical '' and `` Break My Heart '' were simultaneously in the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart ; they are the fifth female artist to have three singles simultaneously in the top ten .

Canarium microurceus is a species of sea snail , a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Strombidae , the true conchs .
Description
Distribution
Phylogeny
In 2006 , Latiolais and colleagues proposed a cladogram ( a tree of descent ) that attempts to show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae . The authors analysed 31 species in the genus Strombus including Canarium microurceus ( referred to as Strombus microurceus in their analysis ) , and three species in the allied genus Lambis . The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I ( COI ) protein-coding gene regions . In this proposed phylogeny , Strombus labiatus ( = Canarium labiatum ) and Strombus microurceus are closely related and appear to share a common ancestor .

One human poll comprised the 1944 National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) football rankings . Unlike most sports , college football 's governing body , the NCAA , does not bestow a national championship , instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies . There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches ' Poll . The Coaches ' Poll began operation in 1950 ; in addition , the AP Poll did not begin conducting preseason polls until that same year .
Legend
AP Poll
The final AP Poll was released on December 4 , at the end of the 1944 regular season , weeks before the major bowls . The AP would not release a post-bowl season final poll regularly until 1968 .

Thermal Integrity Profiling is a non-destructive testing method of evaluating the integrity of concrete foundations . It is standardized by ASTM D7949 - Standard Test Methods for Thermal Integrity Profiling of Concrete Deep Foundations .
The testing method was first developed at the University of South Florida . It relates the heat generated by curing of cement to the integrity and quality of drilled shafts , augered cast in place ( ACIP ) piles and other concrete foundations . In general , a shortage of competent concrete ( necks or inclusions ) is registered by relative cool regions ; the presence of extra concrete ( over-pour bulging into soft soil strata ) is registered by relative warm regions .
Cement temperatures are either sampled throughout the concrete hydration process or a test is conducted at a time prior to the peak curing temperature having been reached . Either way , measurements are available relatively soon after pouring ( 6 to 72 hours ) , typically earlier than when other integrity testing methods such as cross hole sonic logging and low strain integrity testing can be performed .
Temperatures are measured along the entire depth of the foundation . If records at a certain depth show regions with cooler temperatures ( when compared to the average temperature at that depth ) , a concrete deficiency or defect may be present . An average temperature at a certain depth that is significantly lower than the average temperatures at other depths may also be indication of a potential problem . It is also possible to estimate the effective area of the foundation , and to assess if the reinforcing cage is properly aligned and centered .

Serum iron is a medical laboratory test that measures the amount of circulating iron that is bound to transferrin ( 90 % ) and serum ferritin ( 10 % ) . Clinicians order this laboratory test when they are concerned about iron deficiency , which can cause anemia and other problems . 65 % of the iron in the body is bound up in hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells . About 4 % is bound up in myoglobin molecules . Around 30 % of the iron in the body is stored as ferritin or hemosiderin in the spleen , the bone marrow and the liver . Small amounts of iron can be found in other molecules in cells throughout the body . None of this iron is directly accessible by testing the serum . }
However , some iron is circulating in the serum . Transferrin is a molecule produced by the liver that binds one or two iron ( III ) ions , i.e . ferric iron , Fe3+ ; transferrin is essential if stored iron is to be moved and used . Most of the time , about 30 % of the available sites on the transferrin molecule are filled . The test for serum iron uses blood drawn from veins to measure the iron ions that are bound to transferrin and circulating in the blood . This test should be done after 12 hours of fasting . The extent to which sites on transferrin molecules are filled by iron ions can be another helpful clinical indicator , known as percent transferrin saturation . Another lab test saturates the sample to measure the total amount of transferrin ; this test is called total iron-binding capacity ( TIBC ) . These three tests are generally done at the same time , and taken together are an important part of the diagnostic process for conditions such as anemia , iron deficiency anemia , anemia of chronic disease and haemochromatosis .
Normal values
Normal reference ranges are :
Serum iron :
Men : 65 to 176 μg/dL
Women : 50 to 170 μg/dL
Newborns : 100 to 250 μg/dL
Children : 50 to 120 μg/dL
TIBC : 240–450 μg/dL
Transferrin saturation : 20–50 %
μg/dL = micrograms per deciliter .
Laboratories often use different units and `` normal '' may vary by population and the lab techniques used ; look at the individual laboratory reference values to interpret a specific test ( for instance , your own ) .

Newcastle upon Tyne Church High School ( also known locally as `` Church High '' ) was an independent day school for girls in Jesmond , less than a mile north of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne , England . Until 2014 it was the oldest continuously operating girls ' school established in the city .
History
`` Church High '' , as the school is commonly known , was founded in 1885 by the Church Schools Company ( now known as the United Church Schools Trust ) . It left the company in 1925 and was independent thereafter , but retained ties with the Diocese of Newcastle and St Nicholas 's Cathedral .
The school was the first female team to appear on BBC Radio Top of the Form , on Monday 3 October 1949 ; the first series in 1948 had been for only boys ' schools ( in London ) .. The team won the first round against Taunton 's School for Boys in Southampton . It later progressed to the last round of the England section , where it faced a girls ' grammar school team from Crediton in Devon .
Church High was one of the North East 's top performing independent schools in GCSEs and A Levels . In the 2010 GCSE league table , it was ranked joint third with Central Newcastle High School out of 100 schools in the North East . 98 % of its candidates scored 5 or more A * -C grades that year .
On 29 January 2013 it was announced Church High would merge with the nearby Central Newcastle High School to form Newcastle High School for Girls in 2014 . The schools merged in 2014 .
On closure , a heritage website was created to celebrate the history of this much loved school by former members of its staff .

Enfield Square , formerly Westfield Shoppingtown Enfield Square , is an enclosed shopping mall in Enfield , Connecticut . The mall is owned by the Namdar Realty Group . At , Enfield Square is the 10th largest mall in the state of Connecticut , containing 54 shops , all on one level . As of 2018 , there was only a single anchor store : Target .
History
May Center , the mall development branch of May Department Stores , built the Enfield Square , which opened in 1971 , with three anchor stores : G. Fox , JCPenney and Steiger 's . In 1993 , G. Fox was converted to a Filene 's store as a result of a merger . Steiger 's ceased operations at the east side of the mall in 1994 when the chain went out of business . In 1996 , the owner of the mall , CenterMark Properties , was acquired by the Westfield Group .
On April 26 , 1997 , Sears opened in the space formerly occupied by Steiger 's .
In 1998 , the property , valued at $ 50 million , was transferred to Enfield Square LLC and was rebranded as Westfield Shoppingtown Enfield Square .
In August 2000 , JCPenney closed as a result of a nationwide closing of unprofitable stores . The space remained vacant until Filene 's expanded operations by moving its men 's and home departments there in February 2001 . Target built a new anchor on the north side of the mall in October 2001 . In 2006 , both of the Filene 's stores were rebranded as Macy 's after yet another merger . Additionally , the Westfield Group sold the property to Australia-based Centro Properties Group for $ 80 million , which its joint venture subsidiary Centro Watt ( now Brixmor Property Group ) managed the property . In 2012 , Brixmor Property Group hired Madison Marquette to manage the Enfield Square .
In January 2016 , Macy 's announced they were closing both of the locations at the mall as a result of a nationwide closing of unprofitable stores .
In February 2016 , J.P. Morgan Chase foreclosed on the mall after Brixmor Property Group ( Centro Enfield LLC ) , defaulted on a $ 240 million loan taken out in 2006 for renovation purposes .
On August 7 , 2016 , the Ruby Tuesday location at the mall closed .
On December 28 , 2016 , Sears announced that it would close its Enfield Square location in April 2017 as part of a plan to close 150 stores nationwide which left Target as the only remaining anchor store . Party City moved their Enfield location into the mall in 2017 .
On April 25 , 2017 , Express announced that its Enfield Square location would be closed on May 6 , 2017 .
In June 2018 , KeyPoint Partners was chosen to manage the mall .
The property was sold by J.P. Morgan Chase through online auction company Ten-X.com on December 12 , 2018 for $ 10.85 million , however , the buyer was not identified . On January 15 , 2019 , it was announced that the property was purchased by New York-based Namdar Realty Group .
On January 25 , 2020 , the Enfield Planning and Zoning Commission unanimously voted to approve Namdar Realty Group 's proposal to resubdivide the property into 13 parcels as part of a redevelopment plan .
During the summer of 2022 , the roof covering the old Macy 's store collapsed . The Town of Enfield has stepped in to remediate this dangerous situation after numerous requests to the landlord have gone unanswered . A lien of $ 44,000 has been placed on the property to cover the cost of the work performed .

Singapore national cerebral palsy football team is the national cerebral football team for Singapore that represents the team in international competitions . Singapore has participated in a number of international tournaments , but never the Paralympic Games .
Background
Singapore Disability Sports Council is in charge of managing the national team . In 2012 , Peter Schmeichel held a national team player training camp at Jalan Besar Stadium . National team development is supported by an International Federation of Cerebral Palsy Football ( IFCPF ) recognized national championship . Recognized years for the national IFCPF recognized competition include 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 .
In May 2013 , an IFCPF coaching workshop was held in Austria . It was attended by coaches from Austria , Singapore , Italy , Denmark and Jordan . The goal is to develop coaches for both national and international level competitions . Ahead of the 2015 ASEAN Para Games , the team was facing a funding and support crisis . They were unable to get jerseys comparable to that of the no-disability football men 's team . Equipment used for training was used and worn out . They could not train with goals sized for their sport or on a field sized for their sport . They decided that they needed to change their off pitch focus to trying to get interest from local football fans who were disappointed with the performance of the non-disability side . Their performance at the 2015 ASEAN Para Games assisted them in accomplishing this goal . In March 2015 , Singapora men 's national football vice-captain Hariss Harun trained with the team as part of their ASEAN Para Games preparations .
Singapore was active internationally by 2016 , and had national championships to support national team player development . The team 's official grounds were named in April 2016 as Queenstown Stadium as a result of actions undertaken by Sport Singapore on their behalf . The Ministry of State for Culture , Community and Youth was also working in 2016 on greater inclusion for sportspeople with disabilities in order to increase their opportunities to participate at the highest level . Prior to the use of Queenstown Stadium the team trained at Hong Kah Secondary School .
The team was coached by Mohamed Zainudeen since 2013 , going into 2016 .
Players
There have been a number of players for the Singaporean squad . Khairul Anwar Bin Kasmani has been team captain for several years . Khairul Anwar Bin Kasmani 's performance at the 2015 ASEAN Para Games was such that they were the first Singaporean player to score a hat trick at the recently opened National Stadium . In 2015 , Khairul was nominated in The Straits Times ' Athlete of the Year .
Ranking
Singapore was ranked 21st in the world by the IFCPF in 2016 . The team was also ranked 5th regionally in Asia-Oceania in 2016 . In November 2014 , Singapore was ranked 22nd . In August 2013 , Singapore was 23rd . In September 2012 , Singapore was 21st .
Results
The country has never participated in a Paralympic Games since the sport made its debut at the 1984 Games . Singapore has participated in a number of international tournaments .
In 2013 , the team participated in the Football Development Tournament in Vienna . The tournament was organized by Austrian Disability Sports Federation ( OBSV ) , with Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and Singapore all participating . Later that year , the team won a silver medal at the ASEAN Para Games . In 2014 , a 12 player strong Singapore squad went to Myanmar to play in a regional tournament that included hosts Myanmar and Thailand in preparation for the ASEAN Para Games . Singapore won bronze at the 2015 ASEAN Para Games , after defeating Malaysia 2 - 1 in the placement match . Muhammad Shafiq scored the first goal for Singapore before the team 's defense allowed Malaysia 's Mohamad Sobri Ghazali to score the equalizer . In the forty-third minute , Muhammad Mubarak Md Rastam scored the team 's go ahead goal . It was their first of the tournament . 5,323 people attended the bronze medal match in Singapore . Twenty-nine-year-old captain Khairul Anwar Bin Kasmani finished the ASEAN Para Games as the leading scorer , with five goals scored in the tournament . The first game of the ASEAN Para Games was against Indonesia , with Bin Kasmani opening scoring for Singapore in the waning minutes of the game to give Singapore a 1 - 0 victory . In Singapore 's second match against Myanmar , Bin Kasmani scored from the midfield .

All of the state 's executive officers—the Governor , Secretary of State , Auditor , Treasurer , and Superintendent of Public Instruction—were up for election . Democrats Mike Sullivan and Kathy Karpan were re-elected as Governor and Secretary of State by landslide margins , while Democrat Lynn Simons was defeated for re-election by Republican Diana Ohman . Republicans also continued their winning streak in the elections for State Auditor and State Treasurer .
Governor
Incumbent Democratic Governor Mike Sullivan ran for re-election to a second term . They faced Republican nominee Mary Mead , the daughter of former Governor Clifford Hansen , in the general election . Sullivan proved popular , despite being a Democrat in a conservative state , and they defeated Mead in a landslide .
Secretary of State
Incumbent Democratic Secretary of State Kathy Karpan ran for re-election to a second term . Unopposed in the Democratic primary , they faced Sweetwater County County Attorney Tom Zollinger in the general election . Aided in part by Governor Sullivan 's landslide re-election , Karpan defeated Zollinger by a large margin .

Auditor
After considering a bid for Governor or running for re-election , incumbent Republican State Auditor Jack Sidi declined to run for re-election . They endorsed their Deputy State Auditor , Tom Jones , who ran to succeed Sidi in the Republican primary . Jones faced former Deputy State Auditor Dave Ferrari in the primary , and ended up narrowly losing the nomination to him . No Democratic candidates initially filed to run for Auditor , but Charles Carroll announced , prior to the primary election , that they would run as a write-in candidate for Auditor . Carroll was the Democratic nominee for Secretary of State in 1974 and then served as a Deputy Attorney General in the 1970s . After winning 522 votes as a write-in candidate in the Democratic primary , Carroll received the nomination .

Superintendent of Public Instruction
Incumbent Democratic Superintendent of Public Instruction Lynn Simons ran for re-election to a fourth term . They faced a strong challenge in the Democratic primary from former teacher Beth Evans , who attacked Simons for delegating too many of the office 's responsibilities to others in their office , including their longtime Deputy Superintendent , Audrey Cotherman , and for `` abandon [ ing ] '' the Department of Education 's `` basic mission of making Wyoming schools better '' in favor of `` merely counting numbers and issuing press relations gimmicks . '' Simons only narrowly defeated Evans in the Democratic primary and advanced to the general election , where they faced elementary school principal Diana Ohman , the Republican nominee .
In the general election , Ohman attacked Simon for the poor relationships that their office fostered with teachers , state legislators , and Department of Education employees and argued that Wyoming 's highly ranked schools were `` not because of '' Simons . Simons , meanwhile , argued that Ohman would be a `` political puppet whose strings are pulled by a few ultraconservatives '' and for routinely missing work during their employment as a principal . Ultimately , Ohman defeated Simons by a decisive margin , winning 58 % of the vote to Simons 's 42 % .

In geometry , a point reflection ( point inversion , central inversion , or inversion through a point ) is a type of isometry of Euclidean space . An object that is invariant under a point reflection is said to possess point symmetry ; if it is invariant under point reflection through its center , it is said to possess central symmetry or to be centrally symmetric .
Point reflection can be classified as an affine transformation . Namely , it is an isometric involutive affine transformation , which has exactly one fixed point , which is the point of inversion . It is equivalent to a homothetic transformation with scale factor equal to −1 . The point of inversion is also called homothetic center .
Terminology
The term reflection is loose , and considered by some an abuse of language , with inversion preferred ; however , point reflection is widely used . Such maps are involutions , meaning that they have order 2 – they are their own inverse : applying them twice yields the identity map – which is also true of other maps called reflections . More narrowly , a reflection refers to a reflection in a hyperplane ( dimensional affine subspace – a point on the line , a line in the plane , a plane in 3-space ) , with the hyperplane being fixed , but more broadly reflection is applied to any involution of Euclidean space , and the fixed set ( an affine space of dimension k , where ) is called the mirror . In dimension 1 these coincide , as a point is a hyperplane in the line .
In terms of linear algebra , assuming the origin is fixed , involutions are exactly the diagonalizable maps with all eigenvalues either 1 or −1 . Reflection in a hyperplane has a single −1 eigenvalue ( and multiplicity on the 1 eigenvalue ) , while point reflection has only the −1 eigenvalue ( with multiplicity n ) .
The term inversion should not be confused with inversive geometry , where inversion is defined with respect to a circle .
Examples
In two dimensions , a point reflection is the same as a rotation of 180 degrees . In three dimensions , a point reflection can be described as a 180-degree rotation composed with reflection across a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation . In dimension n , point reflections are orientation-preserving if n is even , and orientation-reversing if n is odd .
Formula
Given a vector a in the Euclidean space Rn , the formula for the reflection of a across the point p is
In the case where p is the origin , point reflection is simply the negation of the vector a .
In Euclidean geometry , the inversion of a point X with respect to a point P is a point X * such that P is the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints X and X * . In other words , the vector from X to P is the same as the vector from P to X * .
The formula for the inversion in P is
x * = 2a − x
where a , x and x * are the position vectors of P , X and X * respectively .
This mapping is an isometric involutive affine transformation which has exactly one fixed point , which is P .
Point reflection as a special case of uniform scaling or homothety
When the inversion point P coincides with the origin , point reflection is equivalent to a special case of uniform scaling : uniform scaling with scale factor equal to −1 . This is an example of linear transformation .
When P does not coincide with the origin , point reflection is equivalent to a special case of homothetic transformation : homothety with homothetic center coinciding with P , and scale factor −1 . ( This is an example of non-linear affine transformation . )
Point reflection group
The composition of two point reflections is a translation . Specifically , point reflection at p followed by point reflection at q is translation by the vector 2 ( q − p ) .
The set consisting of all point reflections and translations is Lie subgroup of the Euclidean group . It is a semidirect product of Rn with a cyclic group of order 2 , the latter acting on Rn by negation . It is precisely the subgroup of the Euclidean group that fixes the line at infinity pointwise .
In the case n = 1 , the point reflection group is the full isometry group of the line .
Point reflections in mathematics
Point reflection across the center of a sphere yields the antipodal map .
A symmetric space is a Riemannian manifold with an isometric reflection across each point . Symmetric spaces play an important role in the study of Lie groups and Riemannian geometry .
Point reflection in analytic geometry
Given the point and its reflection with respect to the point , the latter is the midpoint of the segment ;
Hence , the equations to find the coordinates of the reflected point are
Particular is the case in which the point C has coordinates ( see the paragraph below )
Properties
In even-dimensional Euclidean space , say 2N-dimensional space , the inversion in a point P is equivalent to N rotations over angles in each plane of an arbitrary set of N mutually orthogonal planes intersecting at P. These rotations are mutually commutative . Therefore , inversion in a point in even-dimensional space is an orientation-preserving isometry or direct isometry .
In odd-dimensional Euclidean space , say ( 2N + 1 ) -dimensional space , it is equivalent to N rotations over in each plane of an arbitrary set of N mutually orthogonal planes intersecting at P , combined with the reflection in the 2N-dimensional subspace spanned by these rotation planes . Therefore , it reverses rather than preserves orientation , it is an indirect isometry .
Geometrically in 3D it amounts to rotation about an axis through P by an angle of 180° , combined with reflection in the plane through P which is perpendicular to the axis ; the result does not depend on the orientation ( in the other sense ) of the axis . Notations for the type of operation , or the type of group it generates , are , Ci , S2 , and 1× . The group type is one of the three symmetry group types in 3D without any pure rotational symmetry , see cyclic symmetries with n = 1 .
The following point groups in three dimensions contain inversion :
Cnh and Dnh for even n
S2n and Dnd for odd n
Th , Oh , and Ih
Closely related to inverse in a point is reflection in respect to a plane , which can be thought of as a `` inversion in a plane '' .
Inversion centers in crystallography
Molecules contain an inversion center when a point exists through which all atoms can reflect while retaining symmetry . In crystallography , the presence of inversion centers distinguishes between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric compounds . Crystal structures are composed of various polyhedra , categorized by their coordination number and bond angles . For example , four-coordinate polyhedra are classified as tetrahedra , while five-coordinate environments can be square pyramidal or trigonal bipyramidal depending on the bonding angles . All crystalline compounds come from a repetition of an atomic building block known as a unit cell , and these unit cells define which polyhedra form and in what order . These polyhedra link together via corner- , edge- or face sharing , depending on which atoms share common bonds . Polyhedra containing inversion centers are known as centrosymmetric , while those without are noncentrosymmetric . Six-coordinate octahedra are an example of centrosymmetric polyhedra , as the central atom acts as an inversion center through which the six bonded atoms retain symmetry . Tetrahedra , on the other hand , are noncentrosymmetric as an inversion through the central atom would result in a reversal of the polyhedron . It is important to note that bonding geometries with odd coordination numbers must be noncentrosymmetric , because these polyhedra will not contain inversion centers .
Real polyhedra in crystals often lack the uniformity anticipated in their bonding geometry . Common irregularities found in crystallography include distortions and disorder . Distortion involves the warping of polyhedra due to nonuniform bonding lengths , often due to differing electrostatic attraction between heteroatoms . For instance , a titanium center will likely bond evenly to six oxygens in an octahedra , but distortion would occur if one of the oxygens were replaced with a more electronegative fluorine . Distortions will not change the inherent geometry of the polyhedra—a distorted octahedron is still classified as an octahedron , but strong enough distortions can have an effect on the centrosymmetry of a compound . Disorder involves a split occupancy over two or more sites , in which an atom will occupy one crystallographic position in a certain percentage of polyhedra and the other in the remaining positions . Disorder can influence the centrosymmetry of certain polyhedra as well , depending on whether or not the occupancy is split over an already-present inversion center .
Centrosymmetry applies to the crystal structure as a whole , as well . Crystals are classified into thirty-two crystallographic point groups which describe how the different polyhedra arrange themselves in space in the bulk structure . Of these thirty-two point groups , eleven are centrosymmetric . The presence of noncentrosymmetric polyhedra does not guarantee that the point group will be the same—two noncentrosymmetric shapes can be oriented in space in a manner which contains an inversion center between the two . Two tetrahedra facing each other can have an inversion center in the middle , because the orientation allows for each atom to have a reflected pair . The inverse is also true , as multiple centrosymmetric polyhedra can be arranged to form a noncentrosymmetric point group .
Noncentrosymmetric compounds can be useful for application in nonlinear optics . The lack of symmetry via inversion centers can allow for areas of the crystal to interact differently with incoming light . The wavelength , frequency and intensity of light is subject to change as the electromagnetic radiation interacts with different energy states throughout the structure . Potassium titanyl phosphate , KTiOPO4 ( KTP ) . crystalizes in the noncentrosymmetric , orthorhombic Pna21 space group , and is a useful non-linear crystal . KTP is used for frequency-doubling neodymium-doped lasers , utilizing a nonlinear optical property known as second-harmonic generation . The applications for nonlinear materials are still being researched , but these properties stem from the presence of ( or lack thereof ) an inversion center .
Inversion with respect to the origin
Inversion with respect to the origin corresponds to additive inversion of the position vector , and also to scalar multiplication by −1 . The operation commutes with every other linear transformation , but not with translation : it is in the center of the general linear group . `` Inversion '' without indicating `` in a point '' , `` in a line '' or `` in a plane '' , means this inversion ; in physics 3-dimensional reflection through the origin is also called a parity transformation .
In mathematics , reflection through the origin refers to the point reflection of Euclidean space Rn across the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system . Reflection through the origin is an orthogonal transformation corresponding to scalar multiplication by , and can also be written as , where is the identity matrix . In three dimensions , this sends , and so forth .
Representations
As a scalar matrix , it is represented in every basis by a matrix with on the diagonal , and , together with the identity , is the center of the orthogonal group .
It is a product of n orthogonal reflections ( reflection through the axes of any orthogonal basis ) ; note that orthogonal reflections commute .
In 2 dimensions , it is in fact rotation by 180 degrees , and in dimension , it is rotation by 180 degrees in n orthogonal planes ; note again that rotations in orthogonal planes commute .
Properties
It has determinant ( from the representation by a matrix or as a product of reflections ) . Thus it is orientation-preserving in even dimension , thus an element of the special orthogonal group SO ( 2n ) , and it is orientation-reversing in odd dimension , thus not an element of SO ( 2n + 1 ) and instead providing a splitting of the map , showing that as an internal direct product .
Together with the identity , it forms the center of the orthogonal group .
It preserves every quadratic form , meaning , and thus is an element of every indefinite orthogonal group as well .
It equals the identity if and only if the characteristic is 2 .
It is the longest element of the Coxeter group of signed permutations .
Analogously , it is the longest element of the orthogonal group , with respect to the generating set of reflections : elements of the orthogonal group all have length at most n with respect to the generating set of reflections , and reflection through the origin has length n , though it is not unique in this : other maximal combinations of rotations ( and possibly reflections ) also have maximal length .
Geometry
In SO ( 2r ) , reflection through the origin is the farthest point from the identity element with respect to the usual metric . In O ( 2r + 1 ) , reflection through the origin is not in SO ( 2r+1 ) ( it is in the non-identity component ) , and there is no natural sense in which it is a `` farther point '' than any other point in the non-identity component , but it does provide a base point in the other component .
Clifford algebras and spin groups
It should not be confused with the element in the spin group . This is particularly confusing for even spin groups , as , and thus in there is both and 2 lifts of .
Reflection through the identity extends to an automorphism of a Clifford algebra , called the main involution or grade involution .
Reflection through the identity lifts to a pseudoscalar .

Rheotrauma is a medical term for the harm caused to a patient 's lungs by high gas flows as delivered by mechanical ventilation . Although mechanical ventilation may prevent death of a patient from the hypoxia or hypercarbia which may be caused by respiratory failure , it can also be damaging to the lungs , leading to ventilator-associated lung injury . Rheotrauma is one of the ways in which mechanical ventilation may do this , alongside volutrauma , barotrauma , atelectotrauma and biotrauma . Attempts have been made to combine all of the mechanical forces caused by the ventilator on the patient 's lungs in an all encompassing term : mechanical power .

Wilhelmine `` Mimi '' Baxter ( formerly Frei and von Lahnstein ) is a fictional character of the German soap opera Verbotene Liebe ( Forbidden Love ) and was portrayed by Christa Strobel from October 4 , 2005 to February 22 , 2006 .
Introduced as the estranged mother of Johannes von Lahnstein , Mimi appears together with their granddaughter Maximiliane Frei . After pretending to be someone else to get to know their family again , Mimi grows very found of Johannes ' daughter Nico . In the meanwhile , Johannes would not forgive their mother for leaving them all those years ago and wants them out of their life . Mimi feels sorry for what happened back then , but as they try to make their son understand , their marriage to their father Dietrich became loveless and they just are not happy with their life as a Socialite . Johannes still felt resentful , but eventually let their mother back into their life by saying that they have always thought about them As the two develop a better relationship , Mimi gets the chance for an adventure in Africa . Johannes is disappointed to see their mother leave again , but leaves with them on good terms . Eventually , Nico decides to go along with Mimi and they both leave together .
After Nico returns only several months later , it is mentioned that Mimi is still well and travels through the world . Nico later even rejoins their grandmother for another adventure , where the two also visited Thailand . When their twin-sister Jana Brandner died , Nico returns to Düsseldorf and also mourns the death of Johannes , who has been presumed dead after their plane went lost from the radar . At that time , Mimi is not seen nor mentioned by anyone . Nico takes off again and returns in spring of 2010 , where Mimi has already died and made Nico to their main heir . They start exhibitions with their grandmother 's work , which take the interest of a money-less prince , Philipp zu Hohenfelden , who in the beginning tries to con Nico before falling in love and eventually marrying them
With the introduction of Johannes ' brother Ludwig von Lahnstein it remained unclear if the two share the same mother ; implying that Dietrich might have been married to someone else . However it has been confirmed that Ludwig is also Mimi 's son as in one episode they look at the art of `` his mother '' .

The M1 and M3 are two similar series of electric multiple unit rail cars built by the Budd Company for the Long Island Rail Road , the Metro-North Railroad and Metro-North 's predecessors , Penn Central and Conrail . Originally branded by Budd as Metropolitans , the cars are more popularly known under their model names , M1 ( late 1960s/early 1970s cars ) and M3 ( mid 1980s cars ) . The Metro North cars were branded under the M1A and M3A series .
Overview
Even though the LIRR 's fleet of some 900 MP54 electric MU cars constructed between 1908 and 1930 had been augmented between 1955-1963 by about 150 newer MP72 and MP75 EMUs , the roster still contained a large number of increasingly elderly prewar cars which the cash strapped LIRR was unable to replace . In 1965 the nearly bankrupt commuter railroad was taken over by the state owned Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority , later renamed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968 , which was then able to provide large amounts of capital funding to bring the system to a state of good repair . One of the first items on the list was a massive order of brand new self-propelled electric railcars that could replace the remaining MP54s and provide modern levels of comfort and performance .
The Metropolitans , at the time of their introduction , were notable for their rounded ends and quarter-point sliding doors . The cars were fully air conditioned , accommodated only high level boarding , used light weight construction and were built with a top speed of 100 mph and support for Automatic Train Operation . The Metropolitan cars were also the catalyst of change for their respective systems as the high-level boarding required all stations in the electrified zone to be rebuilt from 1966-1968 and the increased power demand forced the LIRR to update its third rail power supply from 650 V DC to 750 V DC to take advantage of the cars ' performance . On December 30 , 1968 the M1s went into revenue service , with the first revenue train being an 8-car local from Babylon to Penn Station .
With a completely new look and feel both inside and out the Metropolitan cars blurred the line between traditional commuter rail and rapid transit with the later R44 and R46 series of cars for the sister New York City Subway adopting many of the same design elements . Compared to the older cars with their drop sash windows , slow speeds , rough suspension and growling gearboxes the Metropolitans ushered in a new era of commuting in the New York region .
M1/M1A series
The M1 series were funded by both New York State and the then-fledgling Metropolitan Transportation Authority which gained operation of the lines partway though the order . The 770 M1s ( 9001-9770 ) built for the LIRR between 1968 and 1973 represented the largest single order of electric multiple units in North America up until that time . 620 cars were in the base order from 1968–71 , with 150 option cars following in 1973 . Additional 178 M1As ( 8200-8377 ) were built for the former New York Central commuter operations from 1971 and 1973 , allowing the railroad to replace its remaining pre-war MU cars and the 100 4500 series ACMUs ( which were in need of a 20-year overhaul ) . Using Budd Pioneer III trucks and powered by four GE 1255 A2 traction motors , each car had 592 horsepower . They were designed to achieve 100 mph running in service , achieving only 80 mph in service due to track and signaling limitations . The LIRR cars also featured support for Automatic Train Operation , although this too was never seen in service .
The Cosmopolitans
On the heels of the success of the M1/M1As , the MTA and a joint venture between GE , Budd , Canadian Vickers and Avco produced a series of structurally similar cars for the New Haven Line . Built between 1972 and 1977 , the M2s ( initially branded by Budd as the Cosmopolitans ) fully replaced the ex-New Haven EMU cars for use on the New Haven mainline and the New Canaan Branch . Budd and MTA would later license the design to other manufacturers for updated versions .
GTELs
In the late 1970s , eight `` GTEL '' ( Gas Turbine-ELectric ) trains were built ; four were built by Garrett AiResearch and four by General Electric . These cars were numbered 4001-4008 , and were powered by both a gas turbine engine and third rail collection for a dual mode operation . They were tested by the LIRR to see the feasibility of running such cars on non-electrified branches . They used the M1 bodies , but had low level boarding stairs . After around 1977 , the cars were out of service . The Garrett-built cars were ultimately scrapped , while the General Electric-built cars became M1As for Metro-North .
M3/M3A series
With electrification areas of both railroads expanding , the MTA placed an order for another series in 1982 , the M3 series . Essentially compatible with , and ( on the exterior ) very similar to , the M1 series , the M3s had updated mechanical elements such as the use of General Steel GSI 70 trucks and a few other small differences . Traction motor cooling was added to the M3 at the cost of added weight which was compensated for by the use of more powerful GE 1261 motors . Even with the extra power this created different acceleration and braking rates from the M1 . While LIRR chose to mix M1s and M3s in the same consist , Metro-North chose not to and would always run with uniform trainsets . A total of 174 M3s ( 9771–9944 , with 9891 and 9892 renumbered to 9945 and 9946 after the Long Island Rail Road massacre ) were produced for the LIRR between 1984 and 1986 , while 142 M3As ( 8000–8141 ) were produced for Metro North , arriving between 1984 and early 1985 .
This order would be the second-to-last handled by Budd , which in April 1987 left the railroad business after taking the name `` TransitAmerica '' under which the last M3s were produced though their builders plates kept the Budd name .
Refurbishment
With the arrival of the M3 series , the M1 and M1A cars each saw midlife rebuilds in the late 1980s in order to prolong their useful life . The overhauled interiors were very similar to those of the M3s . Still , time began to take its toll on the original M1 cars and by the end of the 20th century the time for the cars was running short .
Some Metro-North M3As received minor interior refreshes throughout 2006/2007 . The LIRR M3s , however , have remained with their original , old-fashioned interior style of wood and faux leather .
In 1994 , all M1s and M1As received headlights mounted on the center top of their front ended fiberglass bonnets to illuminate the top areas . This modification was done following an incident in which a Metro-North engineer operating an M1A train was severely injured and blinded when a cinderblock tied below a fence of an underpass crashed through the windshield of the train .
Retirement
M1
In 1999 , the MTA awarded Bombardier Transportation the contract to build the replacement for the M1 series , the M7 series . With the arrival of the first M7s to the LIRR in 2002 and the first M7As to Metro North in 2004 , both roads began to retire the M1 series . LIRR retired the last M1 cars in January 2007 , while a small number of M1As remained in service on Metro-North until March 2009 . In preparation of the retirement of the M1s , the Sunrise Trail chapter of the National Railway Historical Society hosted a `` Farewell to the M1s '' fan trip on November 4 , 2006 .
The Railroad Museum of Long Island in Riverhead , NY has preserved M1 pair 9547-9548 . Pair 9411-9412 survive as training cars at the Nassau County Fire Service Academy in Bethpage . Cars 9401 and 9591 were renumbered to E401 and E591 ( respectively ) and serve as rail adhesion cars . Pair 9745-9746 was held for preservation by the New York Transit Museum and was stored around the system until May 2018 , when it was taken off property for scrapping .
M3
In the 1990s , M3 car 9776 was wrecked in an accident and subsequently scrapped . Its mate , 9775 , was converted to a rail adhesion car and renumbered to E775 . On January 22 , 2013 , car 9870 retired when it collided with a car at Brentwood station and then caught fire . It is currently stored out of service . Its mate , 9869 , was mated with 9772 , which lost its mate 9771 due to electrical failures on that car . Car 9932 , which lost its mate due to unknown reasons , was also converted to a rail adhesion car and renumbered to E932 . In 2018 , M3 pair 9901-9902 was converted to a pair of rail adhesion cars . The cars were renumbered to E901-E902 . One car in each pair was retrofitted with high-powered lasers from Laser Precision Solutions from the Netherlands to incinerate leaf residue .
Between 2011 and 2013 , twenty M3 cars were prematurely taken out of service and stripped of parts to keep the other cars running . They were taken off property to be scrapped in 2018 .
By 2013 , the MTA had spent nearly $ 2 billion to procure a replacement for the M3 series , the M9 . The fleet is similar to the M7 , and the first cars arrived in 2018. , there were 92 M9 cars planned , with options for up to 494 more . However , due to delays in the M9 contract , the Long Island Railroad is keeping around 100 M3 cars in service ; the cars are expected to be rebuilt to last through at least 2024 . Metro-North also planned to overhaul their M3A units , but later stated that they `` are working with LIRR to procure new M9A cars in the next Capital Program to provide additional capacity and to replace their existing M3As instead of overhauling same .

Trigoniulus corallinus , sometimes called the rusty millipede or common Asian millipede , is a species of millipede widely distributed in the Indo-Malayan region including India , Sri Lanka , China , Taiwan , Myanmar , Thailand , Vietnam , Malaysia , Singapore , and much of Indonesia . It is also reported from Fiji and Tanzania and found in South Asia and the Caribbean as an introduced species . It has also been introduced to Florida , and as of 2022 is well-distributed throughout South and Central Florida , with limited sightings in the Northeast and Panhandle .
These millipedes inhabit moist areas , rotten wood and compost . The genome of T. corallinus was sequenced in 2015 , the first time this has been done for a millipede .

Spadina Crescent Bridge is a deck arch bridge that spans a ravine in City Park along Spadina Crescent in Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , Canada .
The bridge was constructed in 1930 , replacing an earlier wooden structure . It was built by the Saskatoon Contracting Co. , owned by Leon and Paul Prescesky . In 1933 , a series of ponds were dug in the ravine as a Depression-era relief project , meant to beautify `` Central Park '' , as the area was known as then . The pond system was extended in the 1950s , but has since been filled in . The remaining ravine still serves as an outlet for storm water .

Akongjamba ( ) was a nobleman of a King in Ancient Moirang in Meitei mythology and folklore . They were Goddess Phouoibi 's lover , but fate did n't permit the lovers to unite , so they reincarnated in legends . The lives of the two legendary lovers were believed to be enacted by Thangjing as a part of the Moirang Saiyon of the Moirang Kangleirol legends .
Legends
Once , Goddess Phouoibi ( Fouoibi ) set out for a journey along with Ngaleima and Thumleima . In Moirang , when they were trying to cross a river , Akongjamba came to the place for hunting . They fell in love with Phouoibi at first sight , and they became great lovers .
Many days later , Phouoibi went to Akongjamba 's house , disguising themselves as a tribal woman ( ) . Akongjamba was not at home , and their mother ( Akongjamba 's wife in another version ) did n't give them good shelter . They were about to hit Phouoibi with a broom . As a divine being could lose their powers at the touch of profane objects like brooms , Phouoibi fled to the coop of the house and transformed into a chicken . Akongjamba 's mother chased her , and they counted the number of chickens . They did n't find any new chicken , so they were gone , and Phouoibi spent the night inside the dirty henhouse . The next day , they went back to their true divine maiden form in a glowing dress . They called Akongjamba 's mother to come out , and gave them the payment for spending a night at their place . They shook an enormous heap of golden grain off their body . The grains fell in the middle of the courtyard of the house , and they left towards the south east direction . Akongjamba 's mother was surprised at this .
When Akongjamba returned home , they found the pile of golden grain as high as a hill in front of the courtyard . Their mother narrated them the entire story , and they realised that the strange lady was Phouoibi , their ladylove . They immediately followed their path . On the way , they found them and they pleaded them to return home together , but they told them that they were not destined to unite to accomplish their work at that birth , and they then left him .
In popular culture
Phou-oibi , the rice goddess is a 2009 ballad opera performed by the Laihui Ensemble . It is based on the love story of Phouoibi and Akongjamba .
Phouoibi Shayon is a 2017 Manipuri mythology movie based on the love story of Phouoibi and Akongjamba .

Ekaterini Dimetrea ( ; 1920 – April 10 , 1965 ) , known as The Poisoner of Mani ( ) , was a Greek serial killer who fatally poisoned four family members with parathion from May to September 1962 . After their arrest , they confessed to the killings and claimed that they intended to poison their entire village out of personal spite , because they had allegedly been mistreated by them . As a result , Dimetrea was convicted and given sentenced to death for each murder , for which they were subsequently executed in 1965 .
Early life
Little is known of Ekaterini Dimetrea 's life . Born in 1920 in the small village of Neochori , Lefktro , they were one of several children from a rural family . At some point in their life , they married and had a daughter , but later divorced their husband and struggled financially as a result , surviving on a 200 drachma welfare check . According to their own claims , Dimetrea was disliked by their family , with their mother constantly pestering them to leave the house while their brother verbally and sometimes physically abused them This was further complicated by the fact that they suffered from partial hemiparesis , which caused their left leg and arm to be weaker than the other . Despite these alleged abuses , Dimetrea was regarded as a normal and calm woman who could do no harm to those around them
Murders
On May 27 , 1962 , Dimetrea was doing some chores around the house when they were suddenly visited by their mother , 80-year-old Stefoula Loukarea . In what appeared to be a friendly gesture , they offered to serve them a plate of spaghetti , with the latter unaware that it had been laced with parathion . Almost immediately after consuming the meal , Loukarea had a seizure , had convulsions and complained of abdominal pain before ultimately succumbing to the poison . An autopsy concluded that their death was the result of a heart attack , but no suspicions were raised at the time since they had had chronic heart problems .
On July 19 , they repeated the act with their 40-year-old cousin , Potoula Tsilogonea , whom they had invited over for some coffee . Like the previous victim , they suffered from convulsions and accidentally hit their head on the floor , causing a massive skull fracture in the process . The subsequent autopsy erroneously attributed the cause of death to be from this very same fracture , and the woman 's death was deemed as an accident , without any investigation into what had led to it in the first place . A few days later , Dimetrea invited their brother , 45-year-old Konstantinos Lucareas , to come visit them and treat them to some coffee . After the visit , Lucareas felt ill and collapsed on the road , whereupon fellow villagers brought them to the hospital , where they were treated for a gastric lavage . Lucareas eventually recovered , but not long after their release , they were invited to have a meal at their sister 's house yet again on August 6 . This time , Dimetrea treated them to some eggs poisoned with parathion , with the end result being the successful poisoning of Lucareas . At the subsequent autopsy , the cause of death was ruled as a `` heart attack resulting from problems with the gallbladder . ''
The sudden influx of deaths made many of the locals believe that a curse had befallen the family , resulting in more attention being paid to them . On September 6 , tragedy struck again when Dimetrea 's 5-year-old nephew , Elias Pitsoula , started foaming at the mouth after being eating a Turkish delight given to them by them The boy died on the way to the hospital in Kalamata , and due to the sudden nature of their death and the fact that they had no prior health issues , it raised great suspicion . A subsequent autopsy found a lethal quantity of parathion in their stomach , leading coroners from the Toxicology Laboratory in Athens to conclude that the boy had been poisoned . The previous three victims ' bodies were also exhumed and examined , with all three showing traces of parathion in them .
Arrest and confessions
Four days after Elias ' death , Dimetrea went to the village 's mayor and admitted to the poisonings , claiming that they 're done them to enact revenge on their family members for mistreating them Not long after , they were arrested by the gendarmes at the local church and then guided them to where they kept their stash of parathion and mercury , with the latter being their original pick for the murders . During police interviews , they claimed that they had also attempted to poison their brother 's wife and their 4-year-old niece Anthoula Thomea , but was unsuccessful since they did not accept their offers of pomegranates . Most shockingly , Dimetrea also claimed that they intended to poison the food and drinks at their brother 's funeral , with the intent of potentially killing a majority of the village 's population . Soon after their confessions , Dimetrea was transferred to a high-security prison in Kalamata , as authorities feared that they could be lynched by other villagers .
Trial and execution
News of the case spread around the national and international media due to its sensational claims , some of which led people to believe that Dimetrea was mentally unsound . As a result , they were ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at the Public Psychiatric Hospital in Dafni . The results of the examination concluded that they were of below average intelligence and possibly suffered from some sort of neurological issue , but was nonetheless diagnosed as sane at the time of the crimes . Due to this , the investigators and the prosecutor suggested that the real motive for the killings was the fact that they would inherit their mother 's house , and the confessions were just a ploy to portray them as an insane person .
As a result , they were put on trial for the four murders at the courthouse in Nafplio . During the court proceedings , the prosecutor called them a `` hyena of hell '' who methodically planned and executed each of their victims , while Dimetrea themselves claimed that they could not remember what they had done . On May 8 , 1963 , Dimetrea was found guilty on four counts of murder and two counts of attempted manslaughter . As a result , they were given four death sentences for each murder plus 15 years for the remaining charges . All of their appeals were unsuccessful , and in the early morning hours on April 10 , 1965 , they were executed via firing squad at the shooting range in Goudi . They were one of the last women to be executed in the country prior to the abolition of capital punishment .
Book
In June 2022 , author Panagiotis Giannouleas released a book titled `` Four times to death ! The ( poisoner ) of Mani '' , where they detail Dimetrea 's crimes .

This was North Carolina State 's third Liberty Bowl in 10 years ( 1963 and 1967 being the other two times ) .
Game summary
With the game a 10–10 tie early in the third quarter , Kansas ' Bruce Adams called for a fair catch on a punt , but in the midst of heavy traffic they fell down on the field , with the ball bouncing off him . NC State recovered the ball deep in Kansas territory . Adams ' argument that they were tripped were ignored by the referees ( television replay appeared to show that he , indeed , had been tripped ) . The Wolfpack soon scored two plays later , and with momentum in their favor , scored twice more . Stan Fritts went for 83 yards on 18 carries in an MVP effort .

Flexjet is an American provider of fractional ownership aircraft , leasing , and jet card services . Founded in 1995 as a division of Bombardier Aerospace , it is currently owned by Directional Aviation , an aviation private investment firm .
Background
Flexjet is a provider of fractional jet ownership , leasing , and jet card services as well as private helicopter fractional , leasing and charter services . Directional Aviation , the private investment firm founded by aviation entrepreneur Kenn Ricci , has owned Flexjet since 2013 . Headquartered in Richmond Heights , Ohio , Flexjet is led by Ricci , its chairperson , and by Michael J. Silvestro , its chief executive officer . Flexjet is one of the largest fractional private jet companies . The company serves over 2,100 clients .
History
Founded in 1995 , Flexjet entered the fractional jet ownership market as a division of Bombardier Aerospace , the world 's largest business aviation manufacturer and itself a division of Bombardier Inc .
By 1998 , doing business as Business Jet Solutions , Flexjet had 41 aircraft , including the Learjet 31A , Learjet 45 , Learjet 60 , and Challenger 600 series , serving more than 200 clients .
At one time , Flexjet offered not only fractional ownership and jet card but also aircraft charter services . Flexjet entered the charter market in 2000 when Bombardier Aerospace acquired Skyjet , which pioneered the online booking of private jet charters . Under Bombardier , Skyjet became one of the first companies to offer a membership program ; eventually , the program became the Skyjet Card .
By 2002 , Flexjet had seen 20 percent annual growth since its founding . It employed more than 1,000 people , half of them flight crew members and operated a fleet of 105 aircraft to serve 640 owners . At the time , Flexjet held an approximate one-sixth of the total fractional market , which then amounted to 650 aircraft and 3,500 owners .
Flexjet saw its first substantial profit in 2006 , with sales of fractional shares up 28 percent and revenue up 30 percent compared to 2005 . It maintained the approximate 16 percent share of the fractional market it had enjoyed four years earlier . During this period , the company began expanding its range of aircraft , including the Learjet 40 and 45 , 60 , 60 XR , Challenger 300 , Challenger 604 , and Challenger 605 .
In 2008 , VistaJet acquired the firm 's non-U.S. operations , then branded as Skyjet International , and absorbed its operations . Subsequently , Flexjet consolidated the remaining domestic charter services under its own brand .
The financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent recession had a substantial impact on the private jet industry , forcing cutbacks and retrenchment at many carriers . Flexjet weathered the downturn and , by the spring of 2013 , was again reporting robust sales , with fractional share sales increasing 108 percent year over year in the first quarter . Flexjet began bringing back pilots who had been furloughed during the downturn .
In September 2013 , private aviation investment firm Directional Aviation announced that it would acquire Flexjet from Bombardier for $ 185 million in cash . At the same time , Flexjet placed orders with Bombardier for 85 jets valued at about $ 1.8 billion , with options for up to an additional 160 jets that could bring the contract 's value to $ 5.2 billion .
In 2014 , Flexjet exited the charter market . As part of the first consolidation of its aviation companies , Directional Aviation moved the charter brokerage operations of its Flexjet and Sentient Jet companies to the Skyjet brand . Skyjet would concentrate solely on charter services , with Flexjet continuing to offer fractional programs and Sentient Jet offering jet card programs . Flexjet offered three programs : fractional ownership , lease , and the Flexjet 25 Jet Card .
In 2015 , Flexjet launched Red Label , an offering under which each aircraft has a dedicated flight crew , customized interiors , and customized seating configurations making up one of the industry 's most modern fleet of aircraft .
Other developments included the 2016 opening of the company 's first exclusive private jet terminal , in Naples , Florida , followed by the opening of similar facilities at West Palm Beach , Florida and Westchester County Airport , New York . Additional facilities since have been opened at Love Field in Dallas , Texas ; Teterboro Airport in Bergen County , New Jersey ; and Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles , California .
Flexjet also announced the launch of intra-European service in 2016 , establishing the infrastructure for its offering initially through the acquisition of United Kingdom-based charter and management company Flairjet . In 2018 , a European affiliate of Directional Aviation 's OneSky acquired a controlling interest in Milan , Italy-based Sirio S.P.A. , a private jet operator and aircraft management firm . More recently , OneSky acquired United Kingdom-headquartered PrivateFly , a digital booking service for private jet charter flights . Flexjet also acquired an Air Operator Certificate ( AOC ) for and opened a new Malta Operational Centre in Sliema , continuing the expansion of its European operation .
In late 2019 , Flexjet announced its European operation would be led by Marine Eugène , former head of sales in Europe for NetJets . Flexjet 's European expansion continued with the opening of Flexjet House in London to serve as their European headquarters . In addition , a European Tactical Control Center to coordinate flight logistics and an aircraft maintenance facility were opened at Farnborough Airport in the United Kingdom .
In November 2020 , Flexjet began accepting delivery of new Embraer Praetor 600 aircraft , adding it to its existing European-based fleet of Embraer Legacy 500s and 600s .
In 2021 , Flexjet acquired two leading helicopter travel providers : U.K.-based Halo Aviation and U.S.-based Associated Aircraft Group . The company added private helicopter leasing and charter services and formed a private helicopter division that sells fractional , lease and on-demand charter access to its fleet of owned and operated Sikorsky S-76 private helicopters serving locations throughout the Northeastern United States and Florida .
In 2022 , Flexjet announced plans to hire 350 pilots in addition to its current total of 800 and add another 50 aircraft by the end of the year .
Flexjet has received awards and certifications for safety including the Federal Aviation Administration 's Diamond Award of Excellence for Aviation Maintenance , awarded to Flexjet in 2022 for the 23rd consecutive year . Flexjet also has received the Aviation Research Group/US ( ARG/US ) Platinum Safety Rating since 2008 .

In enzymology , an UDP-galactopyranose mutase ( ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
UDP-D-galactopyranose UDP-D-galacto-1,4-furanose
Hence , this enzyme has one substrate , UDP-D-galactopyranose , and one product , UDP-D-galacto-1,4-furanose .
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups . The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-galactopyranose furanomutase .
UDP-D-galactofuranose then serves as an activated sugar donor for the biosynthesis of galactofuranose glycoconjugates . The exocyclic 1,2-diol of galactofuranose is the epitope recognized by the putative chordate immune lectin intelectin .
Structural studies
Because UGM is not present in the mammalian systems but is essential among several pathogenic microbes , the enzyme is an attractive antibiotic target . As of late 2007 , 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes , with PDB accession codes , , , , and .

Johnson v. United States , 529 U.S. 694 ( 2000 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the rights of those serving federal probation and supervised release were more clearly defined . The court ruled that `` Although such violations often lead to reimprisonment , the violative conduct need not be criminal and need only be found by a judge under a preponderance of the evidence standard , not by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt . ''
An earlier case of the same name , 333 U.S. 10 ( 1948 ) , held that a search warrant is always required unless there are exceptional circumstances .

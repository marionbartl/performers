The 2016 Southeast Asian haze was an air pollution crisis which affected several countries in Southeast Asia , including Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore .
The haze was caused by Indonesian agricultural fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan . The fires are attributed to illegal slash-and-burn practices by companies and individual farmers , which remove vegetation to make way for plantations of palm oil , pulp and paper .
On 17 August , 365 hot spots were detected on Indonesia 's Sumatra island , with 278 in the province of Riau . On 18 August , 158 hot spots were detected in the province of West Kalimantan . By 26 August , six Indonesian provinces had declared a state of emergency due to the fires : Central Kalimantan , Jambi , Riau , South Kalimantan , South Sumatra and West Kalimantan . Indonesia has reported arresting around 450 people in 2016 for their connections with the fires .
On 17 August 2016 , Malaysia 's Air Pollutant Index first surpassed the 'unhealthy ' level of 100 for the region 's dry season . On 24 August , Malaysia offered to dispatch two Bombardier 415 fire-fighting aircraft if Indonesia would officially request help to tackle the fires .
In June 2016 , Singapore offered Indonesia a Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft for cloud seeding , as well as a Singapore Civil Defence Force fire-fighting team , and assistance in providing satellite pictures and determining the coordinates of fires . On 26 August 2016 , Singapore 's 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index ( PSI ) entered the 'unhealthy ' range of above 100 , while its 3-hour PSI reached 215 .

The Favourite Game is the first novel by Leonard Cohen . It was first published by Secker and Warburg in the fall of 1963 .
In 1959 , Cohen was awarded a $ 2,000 Canada Council grant , which they used to live cheaply in London and on the Greek island of Hydra while they wrote the novel , then titled Beauty at Close Quarters . When they returned to Canada in 1960 , it was rejected by their publisher , McClelland & Stewart . Jack McClelland was concerned about the autobiographical content and found the novel to be tedious and preoccupied with sex . They suggested major revisions , without guaranteeing publication once those revisions were made .
Cohen placed the book with publishers in England and America who requested a shorter length , so they cut the book in half . They wrote , `` anyone with an ear will know I 've torn apart orchestras to arrive at my straight , melodic line . ''
The Favourite Game was published in England in October , 1963 , and in New York in September , 1964 . The book was only available as an import in Canada until McClelland & Stewart published a New Canadian Library paperback edition in 1970 . The current Canadian edition includes an afterword by Paul Quarrington .

In mathematics , Hermite numbers are values of Hermite polynomials at zero argument . Typically they are defined for physicists ' Hermite polynomials .
Formal definition
The numbers Hn = Hn ( 0 ) , where Hn ( x ) is a Hermite polynomial of order n , may be called Hermite numbers .
The first Hermite numbers are :
Recursion relations
Are obtained from recursion relations of Hermitian polynomials for x = 0 :
Since H0 = 1 and H1 = 0 one can construct a closed formula for Hn :
where ( n - 1 ) ! ! = 1 × 3 × ... × ( n - 1 ) .
Usage
From the generating function of Hermitian polynomials it follows that
Reference gives a formal power series :
where formally the n-th power of H , Hn , is the n-th Hermite number , Hn . ( See Umbral calculus . )

Chinese nationals in Singapore ( ) refers to Chinese people who are of Chinese nationality residing in Singapore . According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs , the community had a population of 451,481 in 2019 , with 52,516 originating from Hong Kong and 18,820 from Macau , the 2 special administrative regions of China . The community of Chinese nationals is the 2nd largest foreign community in Singapore , constituting 18 % of the country 's foreign-born population .
Chinese migration to Singapore has been happening since the 19th century , after the founding of Singapore as a free port by Stamford Raffles in 1819 . The demand for a skilled workforce and labour in Singapore was the driving force for attracting Chinese migrants to Singapore during that period of time . Today , newer Chinese migrants includes migrant workers working in various industries of the Singapore economy , with a mix of blue-collar workers and white-collar workers , as well as students .
History
During the 19th century , Chinese migration to Southeast Asia was a common occurrence . Many were unskilled and migrated from China to Southeast Asia
for jobs during the colonial period of the region . In 1821 , the first Chinese junk arrived in Singapore , then a newly founded British port . During this period of time , the port of Singapore became one of the largest hubs in Asia , beating out Batavia ( present day Jakarta , Indonesia ) as an international trading port . By 1871 , due to the influx of migrants from Malaya , China , India and other parts of Asia , Singapore 's population had reached nearly 100,000 , with over half of them being Chinese . By the 1930s , there were 4 million ethnic Chinese living in Southeast Asia , forming a significant minority population within different territories in the region . Today , descendants of early Chinese migrants make up the bulk of the population of Chinese Singaporeans .
Newer Chinese migration today began from the 1980s , with many of them working in blue-collared jobs during Singapore 's rapid industrialisation which began in the 1970s . During 1989 , after the Tiananmen Square protests , the Singaporean government offered 25,000 permanent residency status to Hong Kong residents for them to settle in Singapore . One of the reasons was also to maintain the racial percentage of the 3 major ethnic groups in Singapore , with Singaporeans migrating aboard and to offset the declining birth rate . Education in Singapore is also another reason for migration , with the Singaporean government providing scholarships to attract international students outside of ASEAN countries . This includes pre-tertiary and undergraduate institutions , and although the scholarships are bond-free , recipients would have to work in a Singaporean company for a period of time before they can leave the country .
Demographics
In 1990 , according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs , among the 177,245 Chinese nationals residing in Singapore , there were a total of 150,447 from Mainland China , 15,043 from Hong Kong and 11,755 from Macau residing in Singapore . In 2000 , the number of Chinese nationals increased to 311,501 individuals . Individuals from mainland China and Hong Kong increased by 66.3 % and 70.7 % respectively while the number of Chinese nationals from Macau decreased by 16.1 % for that year . Since then , the population of Chinese nationals residing in Singapore has increased steadily and it reached a total population of 532,734 in 2015 , before falling to 451,481 in 2019 . One of the reasons for the decline might be due to the Singapore government tightening immigration rules in that same year for hiring foreigners . In 2020 , policies on hiring foreigners were further amended by the Ministry on Manpower to encourage companies to practice fair employment practices .
Integration into Singaporean society
Integration of newer Chinese migrants has been harder due to different cultural behaviours and norms between Singaporeans . With the increase of Chinese nationals in Singapore , they are stereotyped as uncouth and having objectionable behaviours like littering , eating on public transit , and talking loudly on the phone . The general high influx of immigrants has also resulted in an increase of xenophobic behaviour against other foreign communities in Singapore . Another reason would be the perception that the Singaporean government gives special treatment to foreigners or permanent residents as compared to Singaporeans , even though some of them do not pledge allegiance to the country . Some newer Chinese migrants tend to regard Singapore as a Chinese society , as a large majority of the Singaporean population is of ethnic Chinese descent , with a `` sense of familiarity '' . This results in some of the newer migrants choosing not to communicate in or learn the country 's lingua franca , English resulting in misunderstandings and thus , being unable to integrate well into Singaporean society .
A 2016 James Cook University study of Singaporean locals and ( mostly mainland ) Chinese students had almost 69 % of the former saying they had the experience of working with international Chinese students in projects . Most Singaporean respondents said they had pleasant interactions with Chinese students while 46 % reported they had many Chinese international students as their friends . Most Chinese students also said they had positive interactions with Singaporeans , though only 31 % said they had many local friends . A 2016 NUS study of 10 PRC wives and 20 PRC students in Singapore found that 80 % of the former and 100 % of the latter said improving their English was important . For mainland wives , 80 % agreed that one should speak more English since it is the official language , 100 % said being polite to strangers was important , and 90 % said being polite to those they know was important . For mainland students , the figures were 85 % , 90 % , & 65 % respectively . A 2018 Nanyang Technological University paper suggested that Chinese national respondents in Singapore had adopted the idea of English being the language that would get them access to higher status .
Controversies
Wang Peng Fei derogatory video incident
In July , 2011 , Wang Peng Fei , then a student of East Asia Institute of Management , uploaded a parody video making derogatory comments about Singaporeans and Singapore culture . Amongst other topics mentioned in the video were comments about Singapore 's low fertility rate and racist comments against Indian Singaporeans . They apologised after the online backlash . Wang was then expelled and a police report was also made against them for their comments , which is a chargeable offence under Singaporean law if found convicted .
Curry incident
In August , 2011 , a new migrant Chinese family was reported to have complained about the smell of their Indian Singaporean neighbour cooking curry . Despite their neighbour closing windows and doors of their home when they were cooking the dish , the Chinese family wanted their neighbours to not cook the dish entirely , which was part of Singaporean cuisine . After the dispute was reported in the newspaper , it received public backlash from Singaporeans and negative comments , mainly towards the Chinese migrant family . A Facebook movement to in response to the Chinese family 's comments was also started . The dispute was mediated by the Community Mediation Centre , under the Ministry of Law and an compromise was reached between the two families .
Sun Xu 'dogs ' comment
In February 2012 , Sun Xu , an undergraduate with the National University of Singapore under a scholarship provided by the Ministry of Education made derogatory comments against Singaporeans on their microblog . After receiving heavy online backlash , Sun issued two separate apologies and was fined S $ 3,000 by NUS along with having their scholarship revoked . They also had to pay back the scholarship benefits that they received , as well as serve community service with the university for three months .

Eva Olmerová ( 21 January 1934 – 10 August 1993 ) was a Czech pop and jazz singer . They are regarded as one of the greatest Czech jazz singers of all time .
Biography
Eva Olmerová was born in Prague in 1934 . They started piano lessons at the age of 6 , as a pupil of Aurelie Káanová-Bubnová . After World War II their grandparents returned from London , where their grandfather had worked with Edvard Beneš , president of the exiled Czechoslovak government . Them parents divorced in 1948 , when they were fourteen .
They remained with their father , at their cottage in the village of Třebsín near Štěchovice . While there , they had first-hand experience of the tramping movement and began to sing folk songs with guitar accompaniment . In the early 1950s they became involved in Prague 's jazz scene and performed with the Arnošt Kavka Band . In 1951 , aged seventeen , they were arrested by the Czechoslovak state security service , in connection with their grandfather 's political activities and their uncle Otmar Kučera 's wartime service as Commander of 313 Squadron RAF . At the police station they experienced degrading treatment : they were forced to undress , then interrogated . Later , in 1958 , they attacked and slapped a police officer and was jailed for fourteen months .
In 1952 , they married for the first time but was soon divorced . For a while they earned a living as a professional singer in the bars of Prague . In 1962 , the composer Karel Mareš offered them an engagement with the Semafor Theatre . Olmerová agreed , but this promising start was sabotaged when their `` criminal past '' was revealed in anonymous letters . Them performance of the Mareš song Jsi jako dlouhý most ( `` You 're Like A Bridge So Long '' ) won them the Czechoslovak song competition Hledáme písničku pro všední den ( `` In search of a song for the weekday '' ) . They were otherwise banned from public performance in Prague .
Towards the end of 1963 the official restrictions imposed on Olmerová 's career were eased . They began a collaboration with the Traditional Jazz Studio , worked occasionally with other music ensembles and was also allowed to perform regularly in the Theatre on the Balustrade , where they met and formed a friendship with Václav Havel , the later Czechoslovak and Czech president . In 1965 they married again . This marriage ended with their husband 's emigration after less than a year . Olmerová began to use phenmetrazine in combination with alcohol – they sought psychiatric help but their use of alcohol and drugs would continue to dog their career .
In the 1960s they performed in several films and in 1967 returned to the Semafor Theatre . In 1969 , they released their first studio album – The Jazz Feeling – with S+HQ and Karel Velebný . It gained wide critical acclaim and Olmerová was invited to perform in Western Europe but the Czechoslovak music agency Pragokoncert , closely tied with the communist authorities , refused them the necessary travel permit due to their `` unreliability '' . In 1969 Olmerová may have met the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald after Fitzgerald 's Prague concert . In this version of events , Ella Fitzgerald was impressed by Olmerová 's voice and invited them to join the rest of Fitzgerald 's European tour . ( Some eyewitnesses question the story . ) Olmerová is known to have remained in Prague during Fitzgerald 's tour . In 1969 they reunited with Pavel Smetáček and their Traditional Jazz Studio .
In 1972 Olmerová married for the third time . This marriage also quickly ended in divorce and in the same year they drunkenly crashed a Wartburg car borrowed from jazz bassist Luděk Hulan . They were arrested and sentenced to ten months in jail . In 1974 , they recorded their second album : Eva Olmerová & The Traditional Jazz Studio . Live performances were increasingly problematic , due to their alcoholism . In 1978 they started working with the Prague Big Band and Milan Svoboda . They recorded their next album , Zahraj i pro mne ( `` Play Also for Me '' ) with the Jazz Orchestra of the Czechoslovak Radio at the age of 48 . It was their first to be sung with Czech lyrics . In 1984 , they received the Luděk Hulan Award .
In the 1980s Olmerová performed with the Metropolitan Jazz Band , the Steamboat Stompers and with the Senior Dixieland , and occasionally sang with folk and country musicians ( Wabi Ryvola among others ) . In 1986 they recorded the album Dvojčata ( `` The Twins '' ) with Jitka Vrbová and Hot Jazz Prague . Them health was rapidly deteriorating , due their alcoholism and associated lifestyle . They lived in poor domestic conditions on a low rate of invalidity pension , but continued singing . From 1989 they performed with what was to be their last regular ensemble , the S-band .
Eva Olmerová welcomed the fall of the communist régime in 1989 and visited Václav Havel at Prague Castle , but their health was ruined . Drahomíra Vihanová made a short documentary film about them in 1991 – Proměny přítelkyně Evy ( `` Changes of Friend Eva '' ) . It generated some harsh critical responses as `` naturalistic '' and `` coarse '' . Olmerová wanted to take Vihanová to court , but the Czech director Ivan Vyskočil discouraged them
In their last years , Olmerová performed with the pianist Emil Viklický . During studio rehearsals for their final album , Svíčka a stín ( `` The Candle and the Shadow '' ) they collapsed , but as soon as they had been treated at hospital they returned to the studio .
Eva Olmerová made their last recording on 26 May 1993 , and died on 10 August 1993 , in the hospital in Prague-Bubeneč . The primary cause of their death was cirrhosis of the liver . They died childless .
In 2006 , the Prague municipal government approved naming a street ( situated in Prague 15 district ) in their honor .
Inspiration and style
Olmerová was an entirely self-taught singer . They claimed to be free of the influences of other singers but admitted to an admiration for Mahalia Jackson and the styles of Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin and Bing Crosby . They referred to Karel Gott , the most popular singer in Czechoslovakia , as having `` ... a homosexual feeble voice with falsetto '' . On the Czech jazz scene they were often compared to Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday , both for their voice and their turbulent lifestyle . Czech music critic Jiří Černý compared them to Janis Joplin in one of their reviews . According to Černý , Olmerová 's potential for world fame was never realised because of their oppression by two regimes – the Czechoslovak communist regime which banned their performances abroad , and their own `` life regime '' . Vlasta Průchová , another significant singer of their generation , stated that Olmerová `` ... has everything , what a good jazz singer should have – the feeling , colourful voice and original expression . '' Them rare feeling for jazz was probably the most valued feature of their style . I merits as a singer were also appreciated by folk and country bands and aficionados . The somewhat sentimental mood of most contemporary folk and country songs were revitalised under their lively swing and blues singing style .

Brian Phillip Buscher ( born April 18 , 1981 ) , nicknamed `` The Urban Legend , '' is a former Major League Baseball third baseman . They served in 2011 as the undergraduate assistant coach for the South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team .
Professional career
Drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 3rd round ( 93rd overall ) of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft , Buscher spent 2003–2006 in the Giants farm system , reaching as high as Double-A with the Connecticut Defenders . In December 2006 , they were taken by the Twins in the Rule 5 Draft . The Twins purchased their contract on July 26 , 2007 , and Buscher made their major league debut on July 27 , 2007 . Buscher finished the 2007 season with a .244 batting average , 2 home runs , and 10 runs batted in over the course of 33 games .
During the 2008 season , Buscher did not make the opening day roster and started with the Twins ' AAA affiliate Rochester Red Wings . They were later called up to the Twins on April 20 and sent back on April 30 after batting .250 in 8 at-bats . Buscher was recalled again on June 12 , taking former Twins reliever Juan Rincón 's roster spot . At the time of their recall , Buscher was batting .328 ( 58-for-177 ) with 12 doubles , seven home runs and 27 RBI in 51 games for the Red Wings . Upon arriving in Minneapolis , Justin Morneau took Buscher under their wing , allowing them to stay at them apartment and showing them how things worked in the major leagues . After their June callup , Buscher replaced struggling veteran Mike Lamb as the everyday third baseman and earned the nickname `` The Urban Legend '' while batting .294 with 47 runs batted in over that stint .
In 2009 , Buscher played sparingly , appearing in 61 games , making 136 at-bats with a batting average of .235 and serving as a platoon DH alongside Brendan Harris . Buscher did not make the Twins 2009 playoff roster . They were outrighted off the 40-man on November 3 , 2009 ,
On December 2 , 2009 , Buscher signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians with an invitation to Spring Training . They did not make the major league club and was assigned to minor league camp on April 2 .

Camille du Bois de la Motte ( fl . 1789–92 ) was a French marchioness and political activist . In 1789 , they were involved in the plans of Princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte , a future queen of Sweden , to depose King Gustav III of Sweden , and acted as the link between Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte and the Fersen family .
Stay in Sweden
Friendship with duchess Charlotte
They were the daughter of Louis Marc Pons , marquis de Pons , the ambassador of France in Sweden in 1783–1789 . As they had done during their tenure in Madrid , they accompanied them to Stockholm , where they acted as their hostess and secretary , and assisted them by creating a net of valuable contacts within the aristocracy and diplomatic corps through their role as a hostess .
In 1784 , they made themselves the personal friend of Princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte during the absence of Sophie von Fersen , and that summer , the three women made a pledge of friendship by uniting in the order La verite et constante amitie at the Rosersberg Palace .
French agent
France , which was the ally of both Sweden and Russia , opposed the Russo-Swedish War ( 1788–90 ) , and their father wished to initiate peace negotiations between Sweden and Russia through France . Camille du Bois de la Motte was given the task to use their friendship with Charlotte to arrange a meeting with their father and the King Gustav III of Sweden .
During the meeting , in the park of Karlberg Palace , Camille du Bois de la Motte handled the negotiations alone with the King in the presence of their father and Charlotte . They convinced the king to agree to peace negotiations . They were to be handled by their father , who would keep in touch with Russia through the French ambassador in Russia , and the Swedish king through Charlotte . The negotiations , however , failed , and they told Charlotte that they believed Gustav III to have agreed to them to stall time and that it had been their intention to trick France all along .
During the war , their friendship with Charlotte was criticized , as it was believed that they used it to inform the foreign diplomats in Stockholm of war secrets given to them by Charlotte . Princess Charlotte denied this , but it was likely the truth .
During the Riksdag of 1789 , Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte prepared to depose Gustav III and place their husband Duke Charles upon the throne , and the war and the Union and Security Act had made them a leading part of the opposition from the nobility . They cooperated with Prince Frederick Adolf and Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm . The plan was to force Charles to act as a symbol of the opposition to the Union and Security Act when the time was right . When the time arrived to make Charles act , however , they refused , which effectively discontinued the coup . Camille du Bois de la Motte is known to have been involved in the attempted coup : they acted as a channel between the party of the princess and that of the von Fersen family , who represented the opposition of the nobility , as well as the diplomatic corps of Stockholm .
Later life
Camille du Bois de la Motte left Sweden with their father when the diplomatic contact between France and Sweden was severed during the war in late 1789 . They followed their father to Berlin , where they acted as their secretary and hostess during their post there . They later returned to France .
They and Charlotte continued their correspondence even after all correspondence between France and Sweden were banned by Gustav III after the French Revolution . They may have influenced Charlotte 's political views : initially , Charlotte , as a sympathizer of a constitutional monarchy , welcomed the revolution , but their views became conservative during the 1790s . Camille du Bois de la Motte was a French royalist , whose family lost its assets during the revolution . They acted as the agent of Charlotte in France , and Charlotte 's friend , Sophie von Fersen , are known to have sent sensitive letters to Axel von Fersen the Younger through them
In 1792 , Camille du Bois de la Motte warned Charlotte that the next appointed ambassador of France to Sweden , Raymond de Verninac Saint-Maur , was an untrustworthy Jacobin , a warning they are to have sent Charlotte on the mission of queen Marie Antoinette .

Danielle `` Hopi '' Elizabeth Hoekstra ( born 1972 ) is an evolutionary biologist working at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts . Them lab uses natural populations of rodents to study the genetic basis of adaptation . They are the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard University . They are also the Curator of Mammals at the Museum of Comparative Zoology and a Harvard College Professor . In 2014 , Hoekstra became a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator . In 2016 , they were elected to the National Academy of Sciences , and in 2017 , they were elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .
Early life
Hoekstra was born to a family of Dutch ancestry . Hoekstra 's first name `` Hopi '' is derived from a Dutch term of endearment . Hoekstra attended a high school near Palo Alto , California . They chose to attend college at the University of California , Berkeley , where they initially intended to study political science . They chose the university because they wanted to play volleyball , which they did for two years . They have stated that at one point they wanted to become the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands , but they were drawn into biology by a class on biomechanics taught by Robert J . Full . They went on to work in Full 's lab , studying cockroach locomotion .
Career
Hoekstra received their B.A . in Integrative Biology from the University of California , Berkeley . Before their graduate studies , they researched grizzly bears for a year in Yellowstone National Park . They obtained their Ph.D. in Zoology as a Howard Hughes Predoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington . For their postdoctoral work , they studied the genetic basis of adaptive melanism in pocket mice at the University of Arizona . In 2003 , they became an assistant professor at the University of California , San Diego . In 2007 , they moved to Harvard University , where they received tenure in 2010 .
They are a member of the advisory board for Current Biology .
Research
Hoekstra is best known for studying the genetic mechanisms that influence the evolution of highly complex natural behaviors . In 2013 , Hoekstra published an article in the journal Nature on the genetics of burrowing behavior in two sister species of Peromyscus mice ; the oldfield mouse ( P. polionotus ) , which builds elaborate burrows complete with an escape tunnel , and the deer mouse ( P. maniculatis ) , which builds a simple and shallow nest . Using a combination of behavioral assays and classical genetic strategies , Hoekstra and their students identified four regions of DNA which control the length of the tunnels dug by the mice . Students in their lab have also studied the connections between digging behavior and the neurobiology of reward .
They have also studied the evolution of the color of mice coats and its significance for adaptation . In 2013 , their team published an article in the journal Science , describing how coat color in mice was controlled by nine separate mutations within a single gene , named `` agouti . '' Speaking about this discovery , Hoekstra said , `` The question has always been whether evolution is dominated by these big leaps or smaller steps . When we first implicated the agouti gene , we could have stopped there and concluded that evolution takes these big steps as only one major gene was involved , but that would have been wrong . When we looked more closely , within this gene , we found that even within this single locus , there are , in fact , many small steps . '' Them work supports the hypothesis that evolution can occur through incremental changes . Recently , Hoekstra has found evidence linking the mutation the Agouti gene to survival in mice . The study showed how a sequence variant in the Agouti gene changes the phenotype and then linked those changes to changes in population allele frequency , demonstrating evolution of trait by natural selection .

Infante John , Constable of Portugal ( , ; 13 January 1400 – 18 October 1442 ) was a Portuguese infante ( prince ) of the House of Aviz , Constable of Portugal and master of the Portuguese Order of St. James ( Santiago ) . In Portugal , they are commonly referred to as the O Infante Condestável ( `` the Constable Prince '' ) .
Early life
Infante John was the son of King John I of Portugal and their wife Philippa of Lancaster . John and their brothers Edward , Peter , Henry and Ferdinand , sister Isabella and half-brother Afonso , constitute what Portuguese historians have traditionally labelled the 'illustrious generation ' ( Ínclita Geração )
Royal career
They were invested as the 1st Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz , Colares and Belas shortly after . In October 1418 , at the king 's request , Pope Martin V approved the appointment of Infante John as the 10th Master of the Order of St. James of the Sword , bringing the old military order into the hands of the royal family . That same year ( 1418 ) , John and their brother Henry the Navigator led a relief fleet to Ceuta and helped lift the Siege of Ceuta .
After the death of Nuno Álvares Pereira in 1431 , Infante John was appointed the 3rd Constable of Portugal . As a result , John is frequently characterised by the appellation O Infante Condestável ( `` The Constable Prince '' ) .
After King John I 's death in 1433 , John 's eldest brother ascended the throne as king Edward of Portugal . In 1437 , Infante John joined another brother Peter , Duke of Coimbra , in arguing against a projected Portuguese expedition to seize Tangier that led to the Battle of Tangier . The campaign ended in disaster . After the Tangier fiasco , John urged the ratification of a treaty with Marinid Morocco that called for the relinquishment of Ceuta in exchange for their captive brother Ferdinand the Holy Prince . The Cortes refused , and Ferdinand was left to die in captivity .
Duke of Coimbra Rebellion
King Edward died in September 1438 , leaving a young son to ascend the throne as king Afonso V of Portugal under the regency of their widow Eleanor of Aragon . This was an unpopular arrangement among the common people of the country , who feared Eleanor would be a puppet of the high nobility who sought to recover the political privileges they lost during the revolution of the 1380s . The prospect of civil war raised its head . To forestall a rebellion , Infante John quickly seized control of Lisbon and oversaw the assembly of a burgher-packed Cortes to elect their brother Peter of Coimbra as regent for their nephew Afonso V. The high nobility , led by their half-brother Afonso of Barcelos , urged Eleanor to hold fast , and a tense power-sharing regency arrangement was agreed upon between Peter and Eleanor .
Peter of Coimbra relied on their close alliance with Infante John to secure the lion 's share of power during the first few years of the regency . Infante John 's sudden death in October 1442 was a terrible blow to Peter , who thereafter found it increasingly difficult to fend off the aspirations of their half-brother Afonso of Barcelos .
Regent Peter appointed John 's son Diogo of Portugal to succeed their father as Master of the Order of Santiago and Constable of Portugal .
Marriage and Issue
In 1424 , John married their half-niece Isabella of Barcelos , daughter of their half-brother Afonso of Barcelos . The couple had four children :
Infante Diogo of Portugal ( 1425–1443 ) – 4th Constable of Portugal and 11th Master of the Order of St. James ; without issue .
Infanta Isabella of Portugal ( 1428–1496 ) , married John II of Castile , mother of Isabella I of Castile .
Infanta Beatrice of Portugal ( 1430–1506 ) , married Infante Ferdinand , Duke of Viseu , mother of Manuel I of Portugal .
Infanta Phillipa of Portugal ( 1432–1444 ) , Lady of Almada .

The Castello di Lombardia ( `` Lombardy Castle '' ) is a castle in Enna , Sicily . It is one of the largest and most ancient edifices in Italy , with an area of some
History
The castle 's origins are related to a fortress erected in the 1st millennium BC by the Sicani on the foundation of the ancient Henna , on a hill 970 m above sea level . It remained a key possession in the subsequent history of the island , and the Romans were able to conquer it only by passing through its sewer network .
Under the castle was the ancient Sican temple of Ceres , site of the widespread cult of that goddess in the whole of Italy , which was described by Cicero .
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , it was used by the Byzantines and resisted Arab assaults for many years . After their victory , the latter rebuilt the fortress around the 10th century ; the castle was also used by their successors in Sicily , the Normans . Two centuries later , architect Richard of Lentini was commissioned by Frederick II , Emperor and King of Sicily , to restore it as a summer residence . They added 20 towers and called in a garrison coming from the Langobardia minor ( Calabria ) , whence the castle 's name .
With the advent of the artillery , the castle lost its primary strategic role and was turned into a prison . In the 20th and early 21st century , the castle was the site of the Teatro più vicino alle Stelle ( `` The Nearest Theatre to the Stars '' ) , used for opera and pop music concerts . The castle is now open to the public .

The Organization for the Resolution of Agunot ( ORA ) is a New York-based non-profit organization that advocates for the elimination of the infliction of abuse from the Jewish divorce process . The organization advocates on behalf of agunot and promotes the universal adoption of Jewish prenuptial agreements for the prevention of get-refusal ( a get is a bill of Jewish divorce ) . Although 98 % of the people ORA helps are women , they also support men whose wives refuse to accept a get . ORA views get-refusal as a form of domestic abuse . Keshet Starr is the Executive Director of the organization .
History
ORA was founded in 2002 by a group of Yeshiva University students . Since then , the organization has resolved over 220 cases of get-refusal , and at any given time is actively involved in approximately 50 open agunah cases . In 2014 , the Slingshot Guide named ORA as one of the most innovative non-profit organizations in North America for its success in `` advocating for vulnerable women and changing the conversation about divorce in the Orthodox community '' .
Advocacy efforts
ORA resolves cases of get-refusal by combining facilitation with advocacy . Their strategies may include `` staging protests in front of a husband 's home and office , urging their community and synagogue to keep them out , raising awareness in the media and applying financial and legal pressure . ''
ORA 's advocacy efforts on behalf of agunot have been covered by several major newspapers , including The New York Times , New York Post , Washington Post , Newsweek , The Daily Beast , New York Daily News , and The Huffington Post .
Educational initiatives
ORA 's Agunah Prevention Initiative raises awareness in the Jewish community about the importance of signing the Jewish prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal . The tagline of their initiative is : `` Friends do n't let friends get married without the halachic prenup '' , and in November 2014 , ORA released a video to promote that message . While there is no way to know definitively if Jewish prenuptial agreements are becoming more popular in the Orthodox world , Rabbi Shlomo Weissmann , Director of the Beth Din of America , stated that , `` Anecdotally , there appears to have been a big increase in awareness and usage in the last few years .

Araminta de Clermont ( born 1971 ) is a British photographer who in 2010 was living and working in London , although they had spent nearly ten years living in Cape Town . Them work explores rites of passage , and the visual currencies of group identification and is particularly concerned with highlighting the art forms and self-expression of their often marginalised subjects . They are perhaps best known for their bodies of work exploring the relationship between person and environment in South Africa . In 2010 they were a winner of Spier Contemporary .
Early life
de Clermont 's childhood was split between London and the Isle of Man , where their grandfather Charles Birkin , the renowned writer of gothic horror stories , lived . They briefly modelled in London in their late teens , including for publications such as iD Magazine , a magazine pioneering The Straight Up , a documentary portraiture style their own work can be seen to echo .
Education
de Clermont studied Architecture at The Bartlett University College London , gaining a BSc , before turning to photography , which they studied first at Central St Martins School of Art , and later at Ruth Prowse School of Art , following a move to Cape Town . In 2008 they were selected to take part in a master class led by Stephen Shore .
Career
de Clermont worked initially as a staff photographer at The Sunday Times , under picture editor Greg Marinovich . `` A complete education in itself , both in photography and in the realities of a nation attempting to recover '' .
They later turned freelance to enable them to concentrate on their own bodies of work , while continuing to contribute to the paper , as well as shooting for various English publications including The Guardian , The Times and The Sunday Times .
Works
Them main series have a universal theme of metamorphosis , with all those photographed having undergone intense physical transformations mirroring deep inner changes that they have either gone through , are going through , or hope to go through , whether for a night , several months , or for a period of years .
`` Life After '' , 2008
Life After is an exploration into the tattoos and lives of members of the South African prison gangs The Numbers Gang upon their release back into society after many years , if not decades , in prison . de Clermont was Initially interested in documenting the marks for their own sakes , and exploring the motives behind such extensive tattooing : whether it was about a need to belong , or whether it simply reflected an absolute immersion in “ The Number ” , whether the tattoos created an armour , or whether they instead offered a voice , a potent form of self-expression , where the prisoners ' skin was perhaps their only remaining possession and form of self-expression . However they became increasingly interested in the men themselves , the journeys they had been on , and perhaps the most pertinent question of all : how they lived with such “ branding ” after their prison sentence ended .
`` Before Life '' , 2009
Before Life looks at girls from The Cape Flats , ( a vast area outlying Cape Town ) , dressed up for their Matric Dance ( South Africa 's equivalent of The Prom ) . In this area , still haunted by all the attendant problems of poverty and displaced communities , the night is a seminal moment for most matriculants and their families . For many families , the youngster may be the first member of their family ever to have completed school , previous generations having been disadvantaged by the apartheid era education system and economic conditions . For others , especially in the cases of more impoverished families , it may primarily be a night of fantasy escapism , a chance to live out their dreams through costume and styling , their first and possibly their last real opportunity to dress up no holds-barred and be the centre of attention . Through their use of stage lighting the youngsters against their home backdrops , de Clermont raises questions about whether such hinterlands can be merely backdrops or whether these environments will in fact swallow the youngster back up , once the spotlights have been switched off .
`` A New Beginning '' , 2010
A New Beginning focuses on recently initiated young Xhosa and Sotho men living in the townships and shacklands surrounding Cape Town . For the majority of these young men , the circumcision ritual is a watershed , an apparent opportunity to start a fresh new way of being . For up to 6 months after their time in the bush , a newly initiated man will wear clothing denoting their status as a new man , showing that they have left childhood behind , has gone through the circumcision process ( with all the accompanying challenges ) and has entered a new phase of life , maturity , and responsibility . Subscribing to certain rigorous guidelines , such attire is instantly recognisable within a particular culture . `` New '' Xhosa men , or Amakrwala , will wear blazers , buttoned up shirts , smart trousers , polished shoes and hats . `` New '' Sotho men , or Makolwane , will wear traditional blankets , hats , and beads . This outward demonstration of an inner change is a hugely significant part of the process , and a great source of pride . Unknown people will engage with the `` new man '' on a completely different level than if they were dressed in their normal clothes . As these suits demand immediate respect , so too do the men wearing them . de Clermont photographed the men wherever they found them , raising questions about the validity of hope and the concept of a new start , when seen in the context of the individual 's surroundings and the infrastructure provided by the government .

Time and Tide is a 2000 Hong Kong action film directed , produced and co-written by Tsui Hark . The film is set in Hong Kong where a young man becomes a bodyguard and befriends a mercenary determined to begin life anew with the woman they just married . The two men find themselves working together to foil an assassination attempt which propels them toward confrontation with each other .
The film was re-written several times during production and post-production stages to accommodate director Tsui Hark 's casting choices . The film was nominated for six Hong Kong Film Awards and received generally positive reviews from critics .
Plot
Tyler Yim ( Nicholas Tse ) impregnates a lesbian cop , Ah Jo ( Cathy Tsui ) after a drunken night . They join an unlicensed bodyguard service led by Uncle Ji ( Anthony Wong ) to earn money to give to Ah Jo , who wants nothing to do with him . Nearly nine months later , Tyler meets up with a butcher named Jack Chow ( Wu Bai ) and their pregnant wife , Ah Hui ( Candy Lo ) , who helps Tyler prevent their father 's assassination at their birthday . Tyler tries to convince Jack to start a bodyguard service with him , but Jack turns them down .
A group of mercenaries from South America , known as the Angels , arrive and threaten Jack , who they call Juan , and their second in command Miguel Joventino ( Jun Kung ) offers them a chance to rejoin them if they kill their own father-in-law . Instead , Jack assassinates Pablo Santosa the leader of the Angels and evades Uncle Ji 's bodyguards , knocking Tyler out in the process , and then steals a case full of cash from under their noses and escapes from the Angels . Jack drops their wife off at their father 's mansion , giving them a key to a train station locker and telling them to go there when their child is born . Tyler is interrogated by the cops in connection with Jack , who accuse them of being connected to the killer because they saw them up close . Tyler tells them nothing .
Ah Jo tries unsuccessfully to parole Tyler , but Uncle Ji succeeds . Tyler thanks Ah Jo , and Uncle Ji locks them up in a transportation crate for a night before letting them out and getting Tyler to tell them about Jack . Uncle Ji gives Tyler more money , which Tyler tries to give to Ah Jo ; they find out that they have just gone into the hospital to give birth . Tyler heads off after Jack , and breaks into their apartment only to find the Angels and Jack have the place staked out .
A running gun battle ensues between Jack and the Angels as Tyler desperately tries to survive in Jack 's apartment . Tyler ends up trapped in the apartment with the gas leaking and only manages to survive the explosion by hiding in the refrigerator , on the advice of Jack . Jack tricks the Angels into killing one of their own and distracting them long enough so they and Tyler can escape the rest . Miguel admits defeat and tries to call a truce with Jack , but then calls it off when one of the other Angels spots Jack 's wife who arrives on the scene to see their former apartment burning .
The Angels take off after Ah Hui , following them to the train station . Tyler steals a taxi with their fake gun , giving their wallet to the driver , who promptly takes it to the cops . The police , still suspicious of Tyler from earlier , place them at the scene of the gun battle and explosion send a Special Duties Unit team after them to the station . At the station , Tyler confronts Ah Hui with their fake gun and takes the money Jack stole from the Angels . Ah Hui goes into labor and one of the Angels shoots a cop , and then an innocent , while trying to shoot Tyler .
In the ensuing panic , Tyler drags Ah Hui off to safety and the SDU team arrives to deal with the situation . In response to Tyler 's shouts that a pregnant woman has gone into labour , the SDU team send in team members disguised as medics to retrieve Ah Hui . The Angels open fire on them . Jack arrives on the scene just before the SDU team - now including Miguel and other Angels disguised as team members - starts a full invasion with tear gas . In the midst of the gases , Jack , the Angels , and the SDU team hunt one another , with SDU officers silently killed one by the disguised Angels , who loot tactical gear from the fallen officers , enabling them to kill even more unsuspecting officers . Tyler escapes with Ah Hui . In a confrontation on railroad tracks , Jack saves the life of a SDU team lieutenant by killing one of the Angels and surrenders to him .
The remaining Angels escape through a tunnel to a stadium full of concert-goers . Tyler has to hunker down in the tunnels as Ah Hui starts to give birth , and Jack convinces the SDU Lieutenant to let them go after Miguel in the stadium . Jack confronts Miguel in the catwalks above the concert goers and kills them with a grenade after a brutal hand-to-hand fight . Meanwhile , Tyler helps Ah Hui successfully give birth before the last of the Angels shows up . A fight ensues , and just as Tyler is about to lose , the last of the Angels gets shot dead by Ah Hui .
Jack is given a head-start to escape the police and visits with their wife , and Tyler recovers the money before going off to the hospital to see their child .
Production
Production on Time and Tide began in 1999 . It was written by director Tsui Hark and Koan Hui . Hui and Hark had collaborated previously on the screenplay for The Blade . Actor Nicholas Tse opted out of appearing in the sequel to Gen-X Cops to be in Time and Tide . Tse announced that it would be their last action film as they desired to focus on their musical career . It was not their last action film as they starred in Wong Jing 's My Schoolmate The Barbarian in 2001 . After seeing Wu Bai in the Taiwanese film The Personals , Tsui offered Wu the role in Time and Tide . Wu 's character was rewritten with them in mind by making them more of a sad loner to match the music they made with their band in China Blue . Cathy Tsui was cast as Ah Jo in the film . They found a scene involving them playing with a dog difficult as they were afraid of them . To make them more comfortable , they were sent to a dog farm where they played with dogs every day to become comfortable around them .
The film was radically altered in post-production . The original cut was over three hours long , which Tsui Hark considered to be too slow-paced . They reorganized the entire script including cutting many of Nicholas Tse and Anthony Wong Chau Sang 's scenes , leaving Wu Bai 's sequences as they were .
Release
The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 2000 . The film was released in Hong Kong on 19 October 2000 . The film made HK $ 4,465,047 in Hong Kong . The film was released on 4 May 2001 in the United States .
Reception
At the Hong Kong Film Awards , the film received six nominations including Best New Performer and Best Supporting Actress ( Candy Lo ) , Best Film Editing ( Marco Mak ) , Best Action Choreography ( Xiong Xin Xin ) , Best Original Film Score ( Tommy Wai , Joventine Couto Remotigue ) , and Best Sound Design . The film received generally positive reviews from western critics . The film received 63 % positive reviews at the film rating website Rotten Tomatoes .

The Zakłodzie meteorite is a stony-iron meteorite found in Poland in 1998 . Its mass is . It is composed predominantly from enstatite and meteoric iron . Currently classified as an ungrouped enstatite achondrite its classification is still an ongoing scientific debate .
Naming and history
The Zakłodzie meteorite was found beside a dirt road by Stanisław Jachymek who was searching for fossils and rocks . The site lies south of the village Zakłodzie ( Lublin Voivodeship ) , after which the meteorite is named .
A fireball , which may well have been the Zakłodzie meteorite , was seen in the area of the find on 21 April 1897 ; its weathering is consistent with such an age . part slices were on sale at /g .
Mineralogy
The meteorite is composed of 60 % orthoenstatite , 20 % meteoric iron , 10 % troilite and 10 % feldspar . Accessory minerals include schreibersite , oldhamite , alabandite , keilite and amphibole . The meteoric iron has a Nickel content of 16 % . The mineral composition is similar to an enstatite chondrite with strongly metamorphosed chondrules . A second interpretation is that the textures are a result of cumulate crystallization or an impact-melt breccia . It 's the type locality of two minerals : browneite ( IMA 2012-008 ) and buseckite ( IMA 2011-070 ) .
Classification
The meteorite was classified as an `` ungrouped enstatite-rich meteorite '' in 2000 . In 2005 it was proposed that the meteorite was the product of magma crystallization and therefore an achondrite . The magma originated from the partial melt of an enstatite chondrite source . It was therefore proposed that the Zakłodzie meteorite should be classified as a `` primitive enstatite achondrite '' . It was classified as an Aubrite-an ( anomalous ) in 2006 . Currently the recommended classification is that the Zakłodzie meteorite is an ungrouped enstatite achondrite .
Some scientists propose that many aubrites and enstatite achondrites are in fact impact breccias or impact-melt breccias . The later being proposed for Zakłodzie and NWA 4301 . The main arguments for this hypothesis are the relics of chondrules , the euhedral enstatites surrounded by meteoric iron and the occurrence of keilite . Keilite is possibly a product of reactions that take place when enstatite achondrites are melted and quenched ( a quick decrease in temperature ) . This could happen during impact events on the surface of the parent body .

The Tooleybuc Bridge is a dual heritage-listed road bridge that carries Tooleybuc Road across the Murray River , located in Tooleybuc , New South Wales , Australia . It was built in 1925 . The bridge is owned by the Transport for NSW , and is also called the Tooleybuc Bridge over Murray River . The bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 and the Victorian Heritage Register on 10 July 2008 .
History
Tooleybuc lies on the extreme west fringe of the saltbush plain , a semi-arid or arid area created by sediments from the Murray-Darling flood waters . The saltbush provided useful fodder and the Murray frontage in this area , as in others , was largely taken up by 1847 . Tooleybuc was on the Puon Buon run , part of the 1840s pastoral empire of Ben Boyd , the whaling entrepreneur of Twofold Bay . In the 1850s Puon Buon was owned by William Degraves and then Christopher Bagot : in the 1860s the Trust and Agency Co. ran 32,000 sheep there and in the late nineteenth century J. Lawrence held the property and ran 50,000 sheep . The high stocking was encouraged by the almost permanent lakes on Puon Buon .
Development of the township of Tooleybuc was assisted by the sub-division of the huge station just before World War I . The Tooleybuc area subsequently became the scene of intensive agriculture , with fruit-growing the principal cash-crop . The river steamers were fundamental to the wool-trade in the nineteenth century ; so was easy communication across the river . A vehicular punt was in operation by the 1870s , with a riverside hotel ( the Tooley Buc ) on the New South Wales side .
Finally in 1925 , in response to pressure from fruit-growers , the present lift-span bridge was erected by the NSW Department of Public Works , just upstream from the old privately owned punt . The bridge was designed by Percy Allan , and was their final lift span bridge .
Description
The Tooleybuc Bridge is a single-lane timber Allan truss and steel lift span bridge across the Murray River at Tooleybuc . The main axis of the bridge is north–south . There are three main spans including one lift span , supported on concrete piers . On the northern approach there are no approach spans , and there are three approach spans at the Victorian end .
The two main truss spans of are of the Allan Type . These trusses support timber cross girders and steel longitudinal stringers . The latter are unusual and are probably replacements of the original timber stringers . The deck is timber . The lift span superstructure is of riveted lattice steel , including the main support girders . The lift span has been converted recently to allow hydraulic operation . The lift span deck is timber on steel girders . The piers to the main spans are concrete with oval diaphragms giving a similar appearance to the cast iron piers under older bridges . The piers are protected by sheet pile cofferdams and filling .
The approach spans ( two being long each , and one being long ) are timber girders . There are five girders to each span supported on timber corbels . The piers to the approach spans , and the junction of approach span to main truss , are all timber trestles .
There is no footway , but there is a timber handrail except on the lift span which has a pipe handrail . The deck is above flood level .
Condition
As at 23 June 2005 , the bridge was in fair condition having had considerable maintenance in previous years .
Future bridge
In May 2016 , NSW Roads & Maritime Services in conjunction with VicRoads released final plans for a replacement high-level bridge across the Murray River , located downriver of the existing bridge . The plans involve a realignment and extension of the Mallee Highway ( B12 ) to commence in Tooleybuc , New South Wales , east of the junction of Lockharts Road , Murray Street , and Lea Street , effectively bypassing the town centre of Tooleybuc . The highway would extend west and then south as it crosses the Murray , before reconnecting with the former Tooleybuc Road , renamed as the Mallee Highway , that connects with the Murray Valley Highway ( B400 ) , north of Piangil , Victoria .
In November 2019 , Roads & Maritime Services announced that the existing dual heritage-listed Tooleybuc Bridge would be added to the New South Wales conservation list of bridges . The bridge will be conserved to ensure its strength , safety and accessibility for the local community .
Heritage listing
Tooleybuc Bridge over Murray River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 and on the Victorian Heritage Register on 10 July 2008 having satisfied the following criteria .
The place is important in demonstrating the course , or pattern , of cultural or natural history in New South Wales and/or Victoria .
The only two surviving Murray River bridges with Allan truss spans , or Allan-designed lift spans , are Swan Hill and Tooleybuc . Swan Hill was the first of its type to be constructed anywhere , and Tooleybuc the last . The bridge has regional historical significance through this association with Percy Allan . It also has local historical significance in the evolving pattern of river traffic .
The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales and/or Victoria .
The Tooleybuc Bridge has aesthetic significance due to its setting and size . Within the town it has landmark qualities . The bridge provides a gateway from Victoria to New South Wales and the town of Tooleybuc , and reciprocal contact between New South Wales and Victoria . The bridge dominates the river valley which provides the focus of recreational activity in the township . The setting is not rare on the Murray River , being similar to Swan Hill . The Tooleybuc Bridge is of technical ( scientific ) significance for its sophisticated design and construction . The Tooleybuc Bridge was the last of a series of bridges over the Murray River that incorporated central lift spans with innovative truss spans .
The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales and/or Victoria for social , cultural or spiritual reasons .
The Tooleybuc Bridge has significance to the adjacent towns as the main crossing of a major barrier to communication ( the Murray River ) . The bridge is a focal point to transport , and also provides the only gateway between the states of Victoria and New South Wales . The Tooleybuc Bridge is of historical significance for its role in facilitating interstate trade between New South Wales and Victoria .

Marilyn Burns ( born Mary Lynn Ann Burns ; May 7 , 1949 – August 5 , 2014 ) was an American actor . Burns was known for playing Sally Hardesty in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ( 1974 ) , which established them as a scream queen and a catalyst of the final girl trope . They reprised the role with a cameo in Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Next Generation ( 1995 ) , and played Verna Carson in Texas Chainsaw 3D ( 2013 ) , the latter being their last appearance in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise . In 2009 , they were inducted into the Horror Hall of Fame at the Phoenix Film Festival .
While in college , Burns made their film debut as a tour guide in Robert Altman 's experimental comedy film Brewster McCloud ( 1970 ) . They played Linda Kasabian in the Emmy-nominated miniseries Helter Skelter ( 1976 ) and thereafter sporadically worked in acting , notably portraying Faye in Tobe Hooper 's Eaten Alive ( 1977 ) and Dorothy Grim in Future-Kill ( 1985 ) . Them final works include appearances in the slasher film Butcher Boys ( 2012 ) , the independent feature Sacrament ( 2014 ) and the posthumously-released film In a Madman 's World ( 2017 ) .
On August 5 , 2014 , Burns was found dead in their home at the age of 65 . Them cause of death was not specified .
Early life
Burns was born in Erie , Pennsylvania , and was raised in Houston , Texas where they resided for most of their life . While in the seventh grade , they appeared in a musical production of A Midsummer Night 's Dream . They attended the University of Texas at Austin , and graduated with a drama degree in 1971 .
Career
In 1970 , they made their first film appearance in Robert Altman 's comedy film Brewster McCloud ( 1970 ) . Burns was cast in Lovin ' Molly ( 1974 ) , but was replaced by Susan Sarandon . Burns stayed on as a stand-in for Sarandon and Blythe Danner . They also helped cast some of the extras in George Roy Hill 's period drama The Great Waldo Pepper ( 1975 ) .In 1974 , Burns starred in Tobe Hooper 's independent horror film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre . They play the character of Sally Hardesty , a teenager who travels with their brother and some friends to the cemetery where their grandfather is buried to investigate reports of grave vandalism , and then encounters a family of cannibals including the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface .
Burns and Hooper had previously met during the production of Lovin ' Molly the previous year . When a casting call was held , they auditioned and was given the lead role . The film was produced with a budget of $ 80,000– $ 140,000 . Burns had performed several of their stunts herself , and she , along with other cast members , had sustained several injuries throughout production . In an article for Texas Monthly detailing the production of the film , John Bloom reported that Burns had `` been poked , prodded , bound , dragged through rooms , jerked around , chased through cocklebur underbrush , jabbed with a stick , forced to skid on their knees in take after take , pounded on the head with a rubber hammer , coated with sticky stage blood , and endlessly pursued by Hansen with their chain saw and Neal with their constantly flicking switchblade . ''
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released to major critical and commercial success . The film grossed an excess of $ 30 million and became the 12th highest-grossing film of its year , and was the most successful independent feature until it was overtaken by Halloween in 1978 . Writing for The Cincinnati Enquirer , Donald B. Berrigan stated that Burns `` deserves a special Academy Award for one of the most sustained and believable acting achievements in movie history . '' Screen Rant ranked Burns ' performance first on their list of the `` 10 Greatest Female Performances in Horror Film History '' , writing that they `` is so convincing in their work as the mentally broken Sally that the audience ca n't help but be left shaken and deeply disturbed by the time the end credits roll . '' The acting of Burns has continued to earn praise from critics and audiences , and established them as a scream queen and a popular culture icon .
In 1976 , Burns had a role in the television miniseries Helter Skelter about the real-life trial of Charles Manson and their `` family '' . In the series , they played Linda Kasabian , a member of the Manson family who was granted immunity in exchange for their testimony against the defendants . Recalling their memories of working on Helter Skelter , Burns said : `` It was a great experience , but nobody really wanted to touch it [ due to the subject matter ] . It was like , 'Who wants to be in that picture ? Who 's actually gon na do that picture ? ' '' The miniseries was acclaimed and nominated for three Emmy Awards .
Following their roles in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Helter Skelter , Burns sporadically worked in acting . They played Faye in the horror film Eaten Alive ( 1977 ) , where they reunited with director Tobe Hooper , and subsequently starred in the films Kiss Daddy Goodbye ( 1981 ) and Future-Kill ( 1985 ) .
Burns briefly reprises the role of Sally Hardesty in Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Next Generation ( 1995 ) , which was directed by Kim Henkel . Them cameo was made in order to establish `` an emotional connection between the Sally character and the Jenny character , a kind of perverse passing of the torch '' . They were set to reprise the role of Sally Hardesty once more in the 2003 remake film of the same name , where they would play an aged-up Sally , however this idea was ultimately scrapped . At the 2009 Phoenix Film Festival , Burns was inducted into the horror hall of fame .
In 2012 , Burns made a special appearance in the Kim Henkel-written feature Butcher Boys , which is often deemed a `` spiritual sequel '' to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre . In 2011 , Burns was cast in the slasher film Texas Chainsaw 3D as Verna Carson ; it was released on January 4 , 2013 , and marks their last appearance in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise . Them final film roles include Beulah Standifier in 2014 's Sacrament , and Ms. Hill in the independent feature In a Madman 's World , which was released posthumously in 2017 .
Death
On August 5 , 2014 , at the age of 65 , Burns was found dead by their brother Bill at their home in Houston . Them cause of death was not specified .

Jean-Claude Richard de Saint-Non ( 1727 – 25 November 1791 ) was a French painter and printmaker . They were born , and also died , in Paris . They are often rather misleadingly known as the `` Abbé de Saint-Non '' ; although intended for the church by their family , they never took more than minor orders . They were a pioneer of the aquatint technique in printmaking .
Family background and history
Their family estate , from which they derive their full title , is the Château de Saint-Nom . It is located in the village of Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche in Yvelines , France . The land was purchased by their father , Jean-Pierre Richard ( died 1747 ) , a wealthy French lord .
Relationships with contemporary artists
Richard , who had an interest in printmaking , travelled to Rome in 1759 where they met and befriended French artists Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Hubert Robert , both of whom were studying at the French Academy in Rome .
Richard made numerous prints of both Fragonard 's and Robert 's work , including Robert 's Vue prise dans les jardins de Villa Mattei aux environs de Rome ( View of the Gardens at the Villa Mattei ) in 1761 .
Fragonard later painted a portrait of Richard ( see picture above ) , which is in the Louvre .

Uncle Bun is a 1991 Indian Malayalam-language film written and directed by Bhadran , and starring Mohanlal in the title role , as an obese youngster . The film is a remake of the 1989 film Uncle Buck and also the official Malayalam debut of Tamil actor , Khushbu Sundar .
Special costumes were designed for Mohanlal , for their obese look by art director Sabu Cyril . The film included a lot of special effects sequences including a shot featuring a 360-degree head-turn . A. Vincent and Jayanan Vincent were hired for the special effects photography , as there were no computer-generated graphics during the time .
Plot
Jameskutty Chacko aka Kuttichan ( Nedumudi Venu ) is an ex-NRI settled in a hilly town along with their wife , Sarah and three children . One day , James and Sarah are forced to rush back to the US to look after their brother-in-law , who gets critically injured in an accident . Despite Sarah 's protest , James resorts to entrusting their children 's custody to their younger brother Charlie Chacko ( Mohanlal ) . Charlie has a heart of gold , is very fond of pets , especially rabbits , and is good in music and dance . However , they are obese and asthmatic , while leading a solitary life spending their spare time smoking and drinking , as a result of a bitter past . Sarah considers Charlie responsible for the untimely demise of their younger sister Rosie ( Charmila ) , who once used to be Charlie 's love interest .
Charlie moves into the family home to take care of the children , Asha , Vinu and Mariah . Charlie wins over the younger children , even earning the nickname 'Uncle Bun ' . However , the 16-year old Asha , who is a typical spoiled teenager , treats Charlie with contempt . While staying with the family , Charlie is often tormented by the memories of the past , when they were in love with Rosie . Asha clashes with Charlie when they sternly forbid them to meet their boyfriend Roy , who apparently had a shady character . At a local club , Charlie runs into Roy , who is revealed to be a serial womanizer . There , Charlie also meets Geetha ( Khushbu ) , a dancer in the club who gets attracted to an affable Charlie .
Asha runs into trouble for cheating during a class examination , which triggers their expulsion from the school . However , Charlie , as their guardian in charge , manages to earn the respect of the matrons in charge of the school and give them another chance . On their way back , they run into Geetha , who follows Charlie all the way to their house and gets acquainted with the rest of the children as well , much to Asha 's chagrin . Charlie manages to interrupt another of Asha 's date with Roy . They reach their home and vents their rage by physically abusing the elderly housekeeper Gloria , ( Philomina ) who leaves the house in tears , much to the shock of Charlie .
Upon Geetha 's persistence , Charlie shares their sordid past with her , which further deepens the bond between the two . Charlie thwarts another date of Asha with Roy at a film theater , leaving them seething . When a child 's play goes hilariously awry , Mariah is greeted by the young neighbor , who also liked Charlie . When Charlie goes there to fetch Mariah , Asha sees it as a golden opportunity to turn the tables against him . Asha asks Geetha to go and see things for herself . An otherwise harmless dancing spree frames Charlie in front of Geetha as a flirt . Devastated , Geetha splits up with Charlie .
Roy arranges a private meet up with Asha at an isolated house . Picking up a stray lead , Charlie reaches the place in time , beats up Roy and brings Asha back home . A violent Asha attacks Charlie and accuses Charlie of destroying Rosie 's life . It is revealed that while dying in Charlie 's arms , Rosie told them that their act to commit suicide was the result of them being cheated on by another man . Charlie silently took the blame all for himself , not wanting to tarnish them name . It is that chain of horrid events , which has made Charlie to save Asha at all costs , while under their watch .
In a fit of frenzy , Asha locks up Charlie while struggling with their asthma , cuts off the power supply , leaving their siblings scared in the dark . They run away from their house and reaches Roy 's . However , Roy and their friend try to rape Asha . Like another divine intervention , Charlie breaks in and saves Asha after a gruesome fight . Asha tries to commit suicide , just like their deceased aunt . However , Charlie stops them in the nick of time . On their way back home , Charlie tells Asha all about the past and why they took the blame for the past fourteen years .
The film comes to an end , where everyone , including Sarah , welcomes Charlie into their hearts . Asha makes up for their previous hostility towards Charlie , by approaching Geetha and paving the way for the couple to reunite and live happily ever after .

Talking to Strangers : What We Should Know about the People We Do n't Know is a nonfiction book written by Malcolm Gladwell and published by Little , Brown and Company ( hardcover version ) on September 10 , 2019 . The audiobook version of the book follows Gladwell 's Revisionist History podcast-style structure , using Gladwell 's narration , interviews , sound bites , and the theme song `` Hell You Talmbout '' .
Summary
Talking to Strangers studies miscommunication , interactions and assumptions people make when dealing with those that they do n't know . To make their point , Gladwell covers a variety of events and issues , including the arrest and subsequent death of Sandra Bland ; British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's interactions with Adolf Hitler ; the sex abuse scandal of Larry Nassar ; the Cuban mole Ana Montes ; the investment scandal of Bernie Madoff ; the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal ; the trial of Amanda Knox ; the Brock Turner rape case ; Sylvia Plath 's death ; and the Kansas City preventive patrol experiment . The book opens and closes with an analysis of the Sandra Bland case .
The book draws from the truth-default theory by psychologist and communication studies professor Timothy R. Levine . `` Default to truth '' is used throughout the book to observe how human beings are by nature trusting , not only of people or technology , but of everything . Sometimes this kind of behavior , the lack of understanding each other , leads to disastrous and tragic outcomes , as elaborated by Gladwell in the stories they bring . Gladwell notes how there are evolutionary social reasons why we trust more than suspect - the need for cooperation being one . Gladwell asserts that defaulting to distrust would be disastrous and that we should `` accept the limits of our ability to decipher strangers '' .
The audiobook version of the book features voices of people Gladwell interviewed , such as scientists and military psychologists . Court transcripts are re-enacted . The book uses the theme song `` Hell You Talmbout '' by Janelle Monáe .
Critical reception
Reviews by Carol Tavris in The Wall Street Journal and Anthony Gottlieb in The New York Times say that `` the book is not really about strangers '' and the `` title does n't describe the book '' . Gottlieb notes how Bernie Madoff , Jerry Sandusky , Ana Montes and others deceived not only strangers , but also those familiar and close to them . Tavris notes how the stories in the book are related to people we talk `` about '' rather than those we talk `` to '' in our daily lives . Tavris asserts that the strangers in the book , like Hitler and Bernie Madoff , are not strangers at all , but people who may have been in the news , or someone we knew or admired , before learning more about them changed our entire perception . Andrew Ferguson writes in The Atlantic that Gladwell does n't define the word `` stranger '' in the book , and the definition varies according to the story being told .
Gladwell is criticized by more than one reviewer about the quality of their research which is on display in the book . Tavris calls them a `` somewhat lazy researcher '' . Ferguson in The Atlantic points out that Gladwell referenced `` poets die young '' in the Sylvia Plath anecdote , using a study which had a sample of just 36 `` major poets '' consisting of `` British and Irish poets born between 1705 and 1805 '' . Out of these 36 , two committed suicide , and this is the basis for the following line in Gladwell 's book which Ferguson criticizes : `` And of every occupational category , [ poets ] have far and away the highest suicide rates—as much as five times higher than the general population '' . Ferguson also questions the reasoning behind how someone would categorize a `` poet '' into an `` occupational category '' ; adding that `` at times they ( Gladwell ) approaches self-parody '' . Tavris also criticizes a footnote that they say is `` flat-out wrong '' , writing : `` The idea that traumatic memories are repressed and can be retrieved only under the direction of therapy is—to say the least—controversial '' . Tavris notes how an underlying theme throughout the book , truth-default theory by psychologist Timothy R. Levine , is used very superficially and without any discussion on `` Under what conditions do we default to truth , and when do n't we ? ''
Tavris asserts that Gladwell 's whole point is that we label people too quickly , even without knowing the whole picture ; we think that we would be able to recognize evil when it stared us in the face , and how wrong we are in this assumption . Gottlieb writes in The New York Times that `` a little more substance would have been nice '' , while Ben East writes in The National that the book has `` no defining , take-home idea '' . The Times of India say that Gladwell 's `` writing is as immersive as ever and their storytelling skills are commendable '' , and that the book is even for those who like the social sciences or fiction .

In many countries , a statutory instrument is a form of delegated legislation .
United Kingdom
Statutory instruments are the principal form of delegated or secondary legislation in the United Kingdom .
National government
Statutory instruments ( or 'regulations ' ) are primarily governed by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 , which replaced the system of statutory rules and orders governed by the Rules Publication Act 1893 .
Following the 2016 EU membership referendum and the subsequent publication of the European Union ( Withdrawal ) Bill , there has been concern that its powers enabling ministers to issue statutory instruments under the bill may enable the government to bypass Parliament . Although this has been criticised by some as being undemocratic , draft regulations must be `` laid before '' Parliament , which may always demand a full debate on contentious issues .
Devolved administrations
Devolved administrations also have the power to make Statutory Instruments within the heads of powers that are devolved to them .
Wales
Wales Statutory Instruments made by the Welsh Government are published as a subseries of the UK statutory instrument series—for example , the Environment ( Wales ) Act 2016 ( Commencement No . 3 ) Order 2017 is numbered 2017No.714 ( W.171 ) , meaning it is the 714th statutory instrument in the UK series and 171st in the Wales subseries .
Scotland
In Scotland , statutory instruments made by the Scottish Government were governed by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 following devolution until the Interpretation and Legislative Reform ( Scotland ) Act 2010 came into force . Unlike Wales Statutory Instruments , Scottish Statutory Instruments are not published as a subseries of the UK series—instead , they are published separately by the Queen 's Printer for Scotland . However , any UK statutory instruments dealing with reserved matters and applying only to Scotland are published in a UK subseries , such as the Insolvent Companies ( Reports on Conduct of Directors ) ( Scotland ) Rules 2016 numbered 2016No.185 ( S.1 ) .
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland , delegated legislation is organised into statutory rules , rather than statutory instruments .
Ireland
In the Republic of Ireland the term `` statutory instrument '' is given a much broader meaning than under the UK legislation . Under the Statutory Instruments Act 1947 a statutory instrument is defined as being `` an order , regulation , rule , scheme or bye-law made in exercise of a power conferred by statute '' .
However , only certain statutory instrument are published and numbered by the Stationery Office , this being mostly where the statute enabling the enactment of delegated legislation required that any such legislation be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas .
United States
Two close equivalents of similar operation are
Executive orders of the President of the United States , which give instructions to various federal agencies on certain actions they are to take in various cases . They have the force of law , but are subordinate to primary legislation ( i.e . acts of Congress ) which may constrain their effect , and are also subject to judicial review .
Regulations of various government agencies ( a form of delegated legislation ) are issued by those agencies regarding subjects those agencies have jurisdiction or responsibility over , or in response to statutes of Congress directing them to take responsibility over a particular subject or issue . They are published in the Federal Register for public notice and comment before becoming valid , and unless objected to by Congress , become effective and have the force and effect of law .
Other countries
Similarly to the United Kingdom , national and state/provincial governments in Australia and Canada also call their delegated legislation statutory instruments .
Canada uses statutory instruments for proclamations by the King of Canada . For example , the Proclamation of the Queen of Canada on April 17 , 1982 brought into force the Constitution Act 1982 , the UK parts of which are known as the Canada Act 1982 .

Upgrade & Afterlife is the fourth studio album by American indie rock band Gastr del Sol , released on June 17 , 1996 by Drag City .
The album cover is Wasserstiefel ( Water Boots ) by Swiss artist Roman Signer .
Composition
Pitchfork writer Nitsuh Abebe characterized Upgrade & Afterlife as a post-rock album where `` folk and avant-garde abstract each other into something warm , minimal , and slanted '' .
`` Our Exquisite Replica of `` Eternity '' '' contains a sample of the score from the 1957 science fiction film The Incredible Shrinking Man . The title of the track is derived from the name of a cheap perfume marketed in public bathroom vending machines .
`` Dry Bones in the Valley ( I Saw the Light Come Shining 'Round and 'Round ) '' is a cover of a John Fahey song , and features Tony Conrad on violin . According to David Grubbs , the idea of having Conrad play on `` Dry Bones in the Valley '' came to fruition after a Gastr del Sol show in Atlanta , where Grubbs observed Conrad `` literally dancing with excitement '' while Jim O'Rourke played the song alone onstage as an encore .
Several sources misidentify track 3 as `` The Sea Uncertain '' . This title , correctly rendered , appears to refer playfully both to a track on Gastr 's previous full-length release titled `` The C in Cake '' and to one of Gastr percussionist John McEntire 's other bands , The Sea and Cake , a moniker derived from McEntire 's mishearing of that title .

Nansi Williams ( 1922–1966 ) was a school dinner lady at Pantglas Junior School in Aberfan , Wales . They are known in Wales and throughout the UK as one of the heroes of the Aberfan disaster of 1966 , sacrificing their own life to save five children .
Personal life
Nansi Williams ( née O'Brien ) was born in 1922 in the Aberfan Cemetery House , the daughter of Dennis and Maud O'Brien . They married David R Williams but the couple had no children . They died on 21 October 1966 in the Aberfan disaster . They are buried in Aberfan cemetery .
Aberfan disaster
Williams was a school meals clerk at Pantglas Junior School in Aberfan . On 21 October 1966 , they were collecting school dinner money when slurry from the colliery spoil tip hit the school . They told the children who were queuing up to get on the ground and flung themselves on top of them . Williams was killed instantly but all five of the children they shielded survived . When their body was later recovered , rescuers found they were still holding a pound note they had been collecting as lunch money .
The BBC screened a documentary to mark the 50th anniversary of the disaster called Surviving Aberfan . Karen Thomas , one of the children shielded by Williams , described to BBC Wales in an interview how their life had been saved by William 's quick thinking :
`` At the other end of the hall glass started coming down the corridor from the head mistress 's room and Nansi the dinner lady jumped on top of us . The wall I think more or less pushed us all together and they took the full impact . '' Thomas and the other children did not realise initially that Williams was dead and attempted to pull their hair to wake them

Route 10 is a bus route operated by the Maryland Transit Administration in Baltimore and its suburbs . The line currently runs from the Wal-Mart parking lot in Catonsville to Bullneck Road/Turner 's Station Dundalk ( the destination sign found on buses ) mostly along the corridors of Frederick Road on the west side and Eastern Avenue on the east side , serving the communities of Yale Heights , Pigtown , downtown Baltimore , Fells Point , and Highlandtown .
The bus route is the successor to the 8 Catonsville , 10 Highlandtown , and 26 Sparrows Point streetcar lines .
History
Route 10 was electrified in 1893 as a streetcar route between Roland Park and Point Breeze . Between Roland Park and downtown Baltimore , the route was similar to that of the current Route 27 . There were also branches to Union Avenue and Sweet Air industrial parks . From downtown to Point Breeze , routing was similar to that of today 's route , with slight variations in the streets on which the trolleys operated .
In 1940 , Route 10 was shortened to Highlandtown , and service to Point Breeze was provided on a new Route 20 shuttle . Though today 's Route 20 does serve the Dundalk area , the no . 20 Point Breeze shuttle was an unrelated service . The origin of the current Route 20 was as a service along Baltimore Street .
In 1959 , Route 10 was converted to a rubber tire bus operation . Service was extended west to Pimlico and east to Sparrows Point after being combined with Route 26 , which started operation in 1926 as a separate streetcar line , before its conversion to a shorter shuttle streetcar in 1950 , with riders on other parts of the line being diverted to Route 10 . Route 26 ended its operation in 1959 , when a branch of Route 10 to Sparrows Point was added .
In 1982 , Route 10 was split into two routes . The Route 10 designation was used for a line that ran from State Center ( the future location of the State Center Metro Subway Station to the Dundalk area . A new Route 27 was formed that back then operated from Pimlico to Albemarle Street , serving the northern portion of this route .
In 1992 , the route to Sparrows Point was modified , and buses took Wise Avenue rather than the Peninsula Expressway . This was initially done because of a road closure , but MTA , finding a demand for bus service on Wise Avenue , did not change the route back .
In 2005 , as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative , a comprehensive overhaul plan for the region 's transit system , Route 10 was combined with Route 2 , and extended west from downtown Baltimore to Catonsville . Under this plan , all trips were routed to the Bullneck Road loop in Dundalk . Service to Sparrows Point , which had low ridership and required a heavy taxpayer subsidy , was no longer provided , and all other short branches on the route were discontinued . In addition , a portion of the route between Lombard Street and the State Center Metro subway station was eliminated . Riders on Wise Avenue were instructed to use Route 4 .
The combined route was initially identified as Route 2/10 during a transitional period . On February 5 , 2006 , it was renamed simply to Route 10 .
On November 1 , 2016 , a route 10 bus was involved in a fatal crash with a school bus . Six people , including the drivers of both buses and four passengers of the MTA bus were killed . The crash is currently under investigation .
BaltimoreLink
As part of the BaltimoreLink overhaul , on June 18 , 2017 Route 10 will be served by two different routes . CityLink Purple will take the entire western part of Route 10 , and CityLink Navy will take the eastern part of Route 10 , with the route moving through O'Donnell Heights .

The UnDutchables is a term originally coined by author Colin White who , together with author Laurie Boucke , wrote a book with the same title . The complete title is : The UnDutchables : an observation of the Netherlands , its culture and its inhabitants . The book was first published in 1989 , has been a best-seller in the Netherlands since 1990 and is also popular in North America , the United Kingdom , Australia , and former Dutch colonies . To remain current , it is updated every 2–4 years . The book has been translated into Dutch and traditional Chinese ( 荷蘭不唬爛 ) .
Authors
When the book was first released , the authors had spent a cumulative total of 22 years living in the Netherlands . Colin White ( British ) lived and worked there for 7 years , and Laurie Boucke ( American ) lived and worked there for 15 years .
Overview
There is no plot and the book is not a travel guide . Instead , the authors subject the Netherlands and the Dutch to an irreverent and unmerciful scrutiny . The UnDutchables takes an in-depth humorous look at daily Dutch life , quirks and character , with subjects varying from coffee drinking habits to child rearing , and from train travel to the toilet . The Dutch press refers to the book as a laughing mirror .
Popular culture
The name “ The UnDutchables ” has been used by numerous entities including a radio program in New Zealand , sports teams , a rock band , an employment agency , an online chat group , a theatrical play , nightclub , firmware , and many videos on YouTube . In 2004 White-Boucke Publishing acquired a Trademark registration for the name “ UnDutchables ” and for a line of UnDutchables merchandise that includes a Dutch-style perpetual birthday calendar , a desk calendar with daily jokes , coffee mugs , T-shirts and pens .
History
In 1987 near the end of a long stay in the Netherlands , Laurie Boucke had the idea to write an in-depth humor book about that country . At the time , there were no books of this genre readily available . Laurie Boucke began formulating the structure and text during the authors ' last months as Dutch residents . Colin White joined the project when their interest was piqued by the advent of desktop publishing . New editions have been published in 1989 , 1991 , 1993 , 2001 , 2006 , 2010 , 2013 and 2017 . The first edition appeared in a comic book / magazine format ( 8.5 '' x 11 '' ) with 80 pages . Subsequent editions have been in a more standard book format , with the most recent edition being 312 pages in length and consisting of 21 chapters .
In 1989 , renowned Dutch journalist Johannes van Dam spotted the book in the front window of the Athenaeum bookstore in Amsterdam and wrote a review for the Dutch daily Het Parool . In their review they wrote that the book “ in a very exact yet funny way discloses all the secrets about us that we really would have preferred to keep to ourselves. ” This review launched the book in the Netherlands . There have been many subsequent reviews . For example , in 1991 , de Telegraaf called the book a “ laughing mirror : readers can only laugh as they concede their ridiculous habits. ” Later , The European called the book “ a cult among English-speaking expatriates ” and The Washington Post described it as “ a sometimes funny , sometimes scathing portrayal of Dutch national habits. ” Film rights were optioned in 1996 when a studio hoped to sign John Cleese as the main presenter , but Cleese was not available , and the film rights are again available .

The USS Araner ( IX-226 ) was laid down as the liberty ship Juan de Fuca under a Maritime Commission contract ( MCE hull 1747 ) on 15 November 1942 at Vancouver , Washington , by the Oregon Shipbuilding Company and launched on 27 December 1942 . The ship was delivered to the War Shipping Administration ( WSA ) on 11 January 1943 and immediately placed under a standard WSA operating agreement with Weyerhauser Steamship Company .
While during service in the Atlantic and Mediterranean they came under fire at least once , on 4 October 1943 , and was credited with downing two attacking aircraft and assisting in driving off the remaining planes . During the Battle of Mindoro they were torpedoed and damaged by a Japanese aircraft , without casualties , in the South China Sea 20 miles off Mindoro , Philippines . They were beached on Ambulong Island . They were refloated and towed to Subic Bay . On 30 December 1944 the ship was declared a total constructive loss . Later repaired the ship entered United States Navy service under bareboat charter from WSA as USS Araner ( IX-226 ) on 23 September 1945 and placed in service that same day with Lieutenant Henry Morath in charge .
Araner appears to have contributed very little service to the United States Navy . They were inspected by an inspection and survey board at Leyte during October , the month following the beginning of their naval service . In January 1946 , probably as a result of that inspection , they received orders to be towed to Subic Bay where all their naval gear was stripped pending their deactivation . On 22 August 1946 , they were placed out of service at Subic Bay and simultaneously turned over to the Maritime Commission 's War Shipping Administration for disposal . That organization finally sold them along with fourteen other vessels to the Asia Development Corporation , Shanghai on 29 January 1948 for scrapping . Them name was struck from the Navy list on 29 October 1948 .

Mrs. Columbo ( 1979–1980 ) , later called Kate Columbo , Kate the Detective , and Kate Loves a Mystery , is an American crime drama television series , initially based on the wife of Lieutenant Columbo , the title character from the television series Columbo . It was created and produced by Richard Alan Simmons and Universal Television for NBC , and stars Kate Mulgrew as a news reporter helping to solve crimes while raising their daughter .
The series debuted in February 1979 as a spin-off to the mystery crime drama series Columbo , focusing on Lieutenant Columbo 's wife , who is never given a first name in the original Columbo series but was named Kate in this series . After poor ratings and reception from both audiences and the original producers of Columbo , both the series and the eponymous character themselves were renamed in an attempt to change direction , but this did not help ratings and the series was ultimately canceled in March 1980 after 13 episodes had aired . Neither Peter Falk nor the character of Lieutenant Columbo ever appeared on the show ; moreover , Falk never endorsed the show .
Series overview
Kate Columbo ( later renamed Kate Callahan after an off-screen divorce ) is the wife of Lieutenant Columbo , the title character from the television series Columbo . Kate is a news reporter who solves crimes while raising their daughter .

Production
Development
Shortly after the Columbo series ended its original run on NBC in 1978 , despite objections from Columbo producers Richard Levinson and William Link , NBC executive Fred Silverman went forward in producing Mrs. Columbo as a spin-off to the original series . Levinson and Link further objected to Silverman 's insistence on casting someone young to play the part ; Kate Mulgrew was only 24 years old when the show made its debut . The information NBC released about the show was unambiguous about the fact that Mrs. Columbo in the new series was in fact the previously unseen wife frequently mentioned on Columbo .
Retooling
The show received poor ratings , however , and as part of efforts to revamp it , the linkage between this Kate Columbo and the Mrs. Columbo of the original television series was reduced . The name of the character was changed to Kate Callahan after an off-screen divorce , and the series was renamed Kate the Detective at the beginning of the second season , followed by Kate Loves a Mystery by November 1979 according to an opening posted on YouTube .
In this ultimate incarnation , the producers completed their retreat from the show 's original premise , and Kate Callahan was then regarded as being a completely different character from Mrs. Columbo of Columbo , Kate 's ex-husband now named Philip . None of the changes aided the new show 's ratings , however , and it was pulled from the air in 1980 , after 13 episodes .
Episodes
Season 1 : 1979
Season 2 : 1979–80
Reception
Peter Falk expressed their disapproval of the spin-off , calling it a `` bad idea '' and `` disgraceful '' . When Columbo returned to the air in 1989 on ABC , it was further established that Lt. Columbo and their wife were still happily married , and the existence of the series Mrs. Columbo was effectively ignored .
Home media
The Mrs. Columbo episode `` A Riddle for Puppets '' was included as a bonus feature in the Region 1 DVD release of the fourth season of Columbo , released in August 2005 . The episode `` Murder Is a Parlor Game '' was included in the third season of Columbo . The episode `` Caviar with Everything '' was included in the fifth season of Columbo .
Both seasons of Mrs. Columbo were released as a 5-disc set called Madame Columbo - Saisons 1 & 2 in France on October 22 , 2014 , by Universal and Elephant Films .

Triple Frontier is a 2019 American action-adventure film directed by J. C. Chandor . Chandor and Mark Boal wrote the screenplay based on a story by Boal . The film stars Ben Affleck , Oscar Isaac , Charlie Hunnam , Garrett Hedlund , and Pedro Pascal as a group of former U.S. Army Delta Force operators who reunite to plan a heist of a South American crime lord .
The film was released by Netflix in theaters on March 6 , 2019 , before a worldwide streaming release on March 13 , 2019 . It received generally favorable reviews from critics .
Plot
Private military adviser Santiago `` Pope '' Garcia , a former soldier , works in Colombia combating the drug cartels . An informant named Yovanna asks for their help with smuggling them and their brother out of the country in exchange for the whereabouts of a drug lord named Lorea . Yovanna tells Pope that Lorea lives in a remote house in the jungle with $ 75 million in cash . Pope travels to Florida to recruit their fellow ex-Delta Force operators , who are now retired , to seize the money under the pretense of working for the government : Tom `` Redfly '' Davis , a realtor ; William `` Ironhead '' Miller , a motivational speaker ; their brother Ben `` Benny '' Miller , an MMA fighter ; and Francisco `` Catfish '' Morales , a pilot . Pope manages to convince the team to steal the money for themselves .
The team infiltrates the house while Lorea 's family attends church to minimize casualties . They subdue the guards but can not find Lorea or the money . Pope realizes that the money is hidden in the walls , and they find far more than expected . Redfly fixates on the money , demanding that the team continue loading past their exit time until they convince them that they must leave . After loading the money in a van , they do a final sweep for Lorea . They ambush them and wounds Ironhead , before Pope kills him . The crew tends to Ironhead 's wound , as the family returns with the rest of the guards . The crew eliminates the guards , burns down the house , and drives away with $ 250 million in cash while leaving the family alive .
They rendezvous with Yovanna and their brother at an airfield where Ironhead 's contact provides them with a Mil Mi-8 helicopter to reach the getaway boat off the coast of Peru . Catfish doubts that the helicopter can hold their weight with all the money and reach the altitude necessary to cross the Andes Mountains . Unwilling to leave behind any money , Redfly urges Catfish to proceed . They drop Yovanna and their brother off over the border where Redfly aggressively questions their knowledge of them , knowing they could link them to the robbery . Yovanna adamantly denies knowing any of the crew 's personal information . Before leaving , Pope gives Yovanna and their brother $ 3 million and visas to Australia . As the crew departs , an unsatisfied Redfly claims that Yovanna was lying but Pope talks them down .
As they attempt to fly over the mountains , the money 's significant weight causes them to crash on a cocaine farm . The farmers become hostile after mistaking the crew for DEA agents , causing Redfly to kill several of them . Pope compensates the village elder for the deaths while Catfish , Ironhead , and Benny prepare mules to transport the money through the mountains .
When they reach the top of the mountain and make their way down , a firefight takes place with two villagers seeking to avenge the deaths of their families . Redfly kills one before the second kills him ; Pope subsequently kills the second villager . Disheartened , they proceed towards the ocean with the money and Redfly 's body . Benny scouts ahead and reports the getaway boat is still there , but the town is filled with remnants of Lorea 's crew waiting for them . They fill their packs with whatever cash they can carry and dump the remainder in a ravine . They attempt to quietly move through the town carrying Redfly 's body , but are discovered . After a significant car chase and various shootouts , the team makes it to the boat with $ 5 million and Redfly 's body .
Later , as the team sets up payment accounts , the guilt-ridden men each agree to give their shares to Redfly 's family . The team separates , and Pope plans to head to Australia to find Yovanna . Before leaving , Ironhead gives Pope a set of coordinates on a piece of paper : the location of the ravine .

The Malabar Manual was an 1887 publication by William Logan , a Scottish officer of the Madras Civil Service under the British Government , appointed the Collector of Malabar . The work was commissioned by the Government of Madras , and originally published in two volumes . The book was originally named as Malabar later renamed as Malabar Manual by Kerala gazetters department . Logan spent about 20 years in Kerala as an acting resident collector and later judge under the British East India Company . The Malabar Manual is a collection of information and assumptions obtained from their travels and studies . Malabar Manual is a veritable book of accurate informations in relation to the geography , mountains and rivers , geology , climate and natural phenomena , flora and fauna , the people , their economy , ethnography , caste and occupations , manners and customs , religion , language , literature , the state of education and such other details . As the administrative head of the district they had access to a vast resource and they also had a dedicated stream of resourceful natives working under him , whose contributions have also gone into the making of Malabar Manual . Revised editions and Malayalam translations are available today .
History of publications
In 1879 Logan had edited and published a book titled A Collection of Treaties , Engagements and Other Papers of Importance : Relating to British Affairs in Malabar which is a carefully edited collection of all the administrative orders , proceedings and other documents related to British Malabar .
This District Gazetteer was published in 1887 by the Government of Madras and in 1906 and 1951 and by the Gazetteers Department of the Government of Kerala in 2000 . When the Gazetteers Department of the Government of Kerala brought out a reprint of the book in the year 2000 , it was titled William Logan 's Malabar Manual in a marked deviation from the original title used by Logan . Malabar has also been published by private publishers such as the Asian Educational Services in Delhi . In the 880s , the Government of India launched a project to publish the India Gazetteer and district manuals on the history and culture of the respective districts . District Collector William Logan was entrusted with the responsibility of Malabar . The first volume of Manuel was published in 1887 . They received 1000 rupees as a reward for this work .
Chapters
The book has four chapters and subsections .
Chapter One - Province - Boundaries , Geographical Features , Mountains , Rivers , Backwaters and Streams
Chapter Two - People - describes different castes , such as population , population density , social status , cities , villages , houses , language , literature , education , caste and occupation , customs and traditions .
Chapter Three - History - Explains Traditional Archeology , Early History , Dutch , English and French Occupations , Occupation of Mysore and British Domination .
Chapter Four - Land - in which sub-sections refer to land tax and revenue assessment .
Review
Published in 2 volumes , the book occasionally uses illustrations and maps . It is very valuable because it is a documentary of the 1880s . Although the Malabar Manual can be seen as a historical book , the author can not be seen as a historian . The reason is that they do not enter into objective or theoretical interpretations . However , many historians believe that their views in the absence of scientific methodology can sustain it as a historical narrative . Although manuals on the various districts of the Madras Province were published in the last decades of the last century , Malabar is the only manual that attracts historians and scholars as a valuable contribution to them . The first chapter provides geographical information . Chapter 2 describes religion , caste , customs , language and literature in detail . The third chapter is the history of Malabar . The cultural heritage of the area , the early history available through other means , the arrival of the Portuguese . This chapter deals with the competition for pepper and other commodities , the Mysore invasion and British rule . Chapter 4 provides information on tenancy and land tax .
Logan was aware of the limitations of writing the ancient history of Kerala . Scholars such as Hulsch , Burnell , and Ellis began to study ancient inscriptions , but records of the Chera kings were only found later . They have examined the traditional documents of Kerala origin . They accept the description of the collective control of a Nair political group as illustrated in it but denies that there was a monopoly of land control by the Brahmin hegemony . Logan has expressly acknowledged the contributions of two natives , O. Kannan and Kunju Menon , both of whom were officers of the colonial administration , for providing them with valuable notes on many subjects
Food economist , Dr. M Raghavan says that Logan 's accounts about having a largely famine free Malabar during the 18th and 19th centuries are factually incorrect .

`` Make It Better ( Forget About Me ) '' is a song written by Tom Petty of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and David A. Stewart of the Eurythmics . It was released in June 1985 as the third single from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers ' 1985 album Southern Accents .
Musically , it is an uptempo number that pays tribute to the Memphis Soul style , with heavy emphasis on horns and funk-inspired rhythm guitar . The music video continues in the Alice in Wonderland motif of `` Do n't Come Around Here No More '' and riffs on the `` model annoyed by flying insect with the face of the singer superimposed '' as in the then-recent `` You Might Think '' video by The Cars .
Cash Box said it is the Petty 's and Stewart 's `` full-blown shot at R & B '' and that it has `` Memphis horns , soulful backing vocals and an irresistible dance beat . '' Billboard called it `` jittery , uptempo , horn-based Memphis soul . ''

Computer-integrated manufacturing ( CIM ) is the manufacturing approach of using computers to control entire production process . This integration allows individual processes to exchange information with each part . Manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone by the integration of computers . Typically CIM relies on closed-loop control processes based on real-time input from sensors . It is also known as flexible design and manufacturing .
Overview
Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive , aviation , space , and ship building industries .
The term `` computer-integrated manufacturing '' is both a method of manufacturing and the name of a computer-automated system in which individual engineering , production , marketing , and support functions of a manufacturing enterprise are organized .
In a CIM system functional areas such as design , analysis , planning , purchasing , cost accounting , inventory control , and distribution are linked through the computer with factory floor functions such as materials handling and management , providing direct control and monitoring of all the operation .
CIM is an example of application of Information and Communication Technology ( ICT ) in the Manufacturing process .
CIM is an example of the implementation of information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) in manufacturing .
CIM implies that there are at least two computers exchanging information , e.g . the controller of an arm robot and a micro-controller .
CIM is most useful where a high level of ICT is used in the company or facility , such as CAD/CAM systems , and the availability of process planning and its data .
History
The idea of `` digital manufacturing '' became prominent in the early 1970s , with the release of Dr. Joseph Harrington 's book , Computer Integrated Manufacturing . However , it was not until 1984 when computer-integrated manufacturing began to be developed and promoted by machine tool manufacturers and the Computer and Automated Systems Association and Society of Manufacturing Engineers ( CASA/SME ) .
`` CIM is the integration of total manufacturing enterprise by using integrated systems and data communication coupled with new managerial philosophies that improve organizational and personnel efficiency . '' ERHUM
In a literature research was shown that 37 different concepts of CIM were published , most of them from Germany and USA . In a timeline of the 37 publications it is possible to see how the CIM concept developed over time . Also it is quite markable how different the concepts of all publications are .
Topics
Key challenges
There are three major challenges to development of a smoothly operating computer-integrated manufacturing system :
Integration of components from different suppliers : When different machines , such as CNC , conveyors and robots , are using different communications protocols ( In the case of AGVs , even differing lengths of time for charging the batteries ) may cause problems .
Data integrity : The higher the degree of automation , the more critical is the integrity of the data used to control the machines . While the CIM system saves on labor of operating the machines , it requires extra human labor in ensuring that there are proper safeguards for the data signals that are used to control the machines .
Process control : Computers may be used to assist the human operators of the manufacturing facility , but there must always be a competent engineer on hand to handle circumstances which could not be foreseen by the designers of the control software .
Subsystems
A computer-integrated manufacturing system is not the same as a `` lights-out factory '' , which would run completely independent of human intervention , although it is a big step in that direction . Part of the system involves flexible manufacturing , where the factory can be quickly modified to produce different products , or where the volume of products can be changed quickly with the aid of computers . Some or all of the following subsystems may be found in a CIM operation :
Computer-aided techniques :
CAD ( computer-aided design )
CAE ( computer-aided engineering )
CAM ( computer-aided manufacturing )
CAPP ( computer-aided process planning )
CAQ ( computer-aided quality assurance )
PPC ( production planning and control )
ERP ( enterprise resource planning )
A business system integrated by a common database .
Devices and equipment required :
CNC , Computer numerical controlled machine tools
DNC , Direct numerical control machine tools
PLCs , Programmable logic controllers
Robotics
Computers
Software
Controllers
Networks
Interfacing
Monitoring equipment
Technologies :
FMS , ( flexible manufacturing system )
ASRS , automated storage and retrieval system
AGV , automated guided vehicle

CIMOSA
CIMOSA ( Computer Integrated Manufacturing Open System Architecture ) , is a 1990s European proposal for an open systems architecture for CIM developed by the AMICE Consortium as a series of ESPRIT projects . The goal of CIMOSA was `` to help companies to manage change and integrate their facilities and operations to face world wide competition . It provides a consistent architectural framework for both enterprise modeling and enterprise integration as required in CIM environments '' .
CIMOSA provides a solution for business integration with four types of products :
The CIMOSA Enterprise Modeling Framework , which provides a reference architecture for enterprise architecture
CIMOSA IIS , a standard for physical and application integration .
CIMOSA Systems Life Cycle , is a life cycle model for CIM development and deployment .
Inputs to standardization , basics for international standard development .
CIMOSA according to Vernadat ( 1996 ) , coined the term business process and introduced the process-based approach for integrated enterprise modeling based on a cross-boundaries approach , which opposed to traditional function or activity-based approaches . With CIMOSA also the concept of an `` Open System Architecture '' ( OSA ) for CIM was introduced , which was designed to be vendor-independent , and constructed with standardised CIM modules . Here to the OSA is `` described in terms of their function , information , resource , and organizational aspects . This should be designed with structured engineering methods and made operational in a modular and evolutionary architecture for operational use '' .
AREAS
There are multiple areas of usage :
In Industrial and Production engineering
In mechanical engineering
In electronic design automation ( printed circuit board ( PCB ) and integrated circuit design data for manufacturing )

The Alliance Graduate School ( AGS ) is an inter-denominational graduate school of theology in Quezon City , Philippines , housed together with Philippine Alliance College of Theology ( PACT ) . It was established in 1977 .
History
In 1966 , leaders of The Christian and Missionary Alliance Churches of the Philippines , Inc. ( CAMACOP ) and the Philippine Mission of The Christian and Missionary Alliance ( C & MA ) recognized the need for theological training on the graduate level and began to plan for the future . At that time , Ebenezer Bible College was the denomination 's only major leadership development center .
1970s : foundation years
In June 1977 , under the leadership of Dr. Metosalem Q. Castillo , the Alliance Graduate School of Theology and Missions ( AGSTM ) was founded . The fledgling institution shared the Ebenezer campus in Zamboanga City . Dr. Castillo served as the president for the first five years and gave direction to the program , focusing on missions and church growth .
1980s : years of identity-building
In 1982 the seminary moved to Quezon City in Metro Manila and changed its name to the Alliance Biblical Seminary ( ABS ) . This transfer reflected an increased desire and vision for supporting denominational goals directed toward the needs of urban centers in the Philippines and across Asia . The Alliance saw Manila as an ideal location for the school .
But the dream was much more than a new location . Academic programs were needed that would extend beyond missions and church growth to include an emphasis on biblical , theological , and pastoral ministry studies . In response to the need to deepen and broaden the scope of theological education and ministry skills , ABS developed a regular three-year professional Master of Divinity ( M.Div . ) course with concentrations in Missions , Pastoral Studies and Christian Education .
With the 1982 move , the late Rev . Valmike B. Apuzen , Sr. assumed the position of president . During its initial years in Manila , the seminary was located in rented facilities of BBB in Quezon City , but in 1984 , permanent site for the growing school was secured with the purchase of a large house in the quiet neighborhood of Veterans Village in Proj . 7 . Dr. Rodrigo D. Tano served as president from 1984 to 1997 .
1990s : years of expansion
In 1993 , during Dr. Tano 's watch , a two-year program in Christian Counseling – the first in the Philippines – was started . The increasing number of students enrolled in the program attests to the need to prepare `` people-helping '' ministries within and outside the local church .
In 1996 , a Master of Christian Studies ( M.C.S . ) program was added to the curriculum in response to the needs of those involved in lay and focused para-church ministries . In 1997 , the Youth Ministry graduate programs began , another first for the Philippines and Asia . In response to the need to train church workers for ministry with the poor and enable the church to address poverty , injustice , and environmental issues , ABS introduced the Community Development Program . This program was offered in partnership with the Asian School of Development and Cross-Cultural Studies ( ASDECS ) training consortium . The Applied Linguistics Program began in 2000 after ABS and the Translator 's Association of the Philippines ( TAP ) signed a memorandum of agreement to offer a joint training program for Bible translators . Beginning with the school year 2002-03 , this program also provides translation and linguistics training in Asia for the summer Institute of Linguistics and Wycliffe Bible Translators .
The programs were run in partnerships with either institutions or persons or both . They were offered without the substantial market analyses as required by CHED . These analyses are important as variables therein provide the reasons for sustainability .
The Faculty-Staff Retreat in February 1999 was the beginning of what became commonly known as the ABS process . This process , with the mission statement `` Advancing , building , and strengthening ABS for the 21st century '' , was a comprehensive process of institutional renewal and strategic planning . It culminated in the ABS Retreat 2000 where 51 participants from ABS dreamed about and planned for the future of ABS . The ABS process resulted in a strategic plan for the next five years . This strategic plan included action plans for a comprehensive curriculum revision and development , and for restructuring the school into a team-based organization with shared leadership .
The curriculum development process resulted in a new curriculum with several integrating themes across programs , a strong intent to balance academic scholarship and professional training for ministry skills , an improved field education program , and a new philosophy . Existing programs were restructured , and several new ones added such as the Marriage and Family Ministries , Academic Research and Educational Ministries for the school context . The Missions Program started developing a sub-track for Muslim ministries . The Distance and Extension Learning Program ( DELP ) , initiated with small beginnings , was also started .
2000s : '
In 2003 , Dr. Jonathan V. Exiomo was appointed president by the Board of Trustees .
In November 2004 , the name ABS was changed to Alliance Graduate School to avoid risking the lives and ministries of alumni working in limited access nations .
In 2006 , AGS ventured into innovative programs by initially offering a Master of Ministry ( M.Min . ) in pastoral leadership in response to pastors ' and church leaders ' desire to do graduate level studies without leaving home and work .
Today , the M.Min . Pastoral Leadership provides a growth opportunity among denominations leaders and like-minded Christian organizations at the key centers in the Philippines .

Copper sulfides describe a family of chemical compounds and minerals with the formula CuxSy . Both minerals and synthetic materials comprise these compounds . Some copper sulfides are economically important ores .
Prominent copper sulfide minerals include Cu2S ( chalcocite ) and CuS ( covellite ) . In the mining industry , the minerals bornite or chalcopyrite , which consist of mixed copper-iron sulfides , are often referred to as `` copper sulfides '' . In chemistry , a `` binary copper sulfide '' is any binary chemical compound of the elements copper and sulfur . Whatever their source , copper sulfides vary widely in composition with 0.5 ≤ Cu/S ≤ 2 , including numerous non-stoichiometric compounds .
Known copper sulfides
The naturally occurring mineral binary compounds of copper and sulfur are listed below . Investigations of covellite ( CuS ) indicate that there are other metastable Cu-S phases still to be fully characterised .
CuS2 , villamaninite or
CuS , covellite , copper monosulfide
Cu9S8 ( Cu1.12S ) , yarrowite
Cu39S28 ( Cu1.39S ) spionkopite
Cu8S5 ( Cu1.6S ) , geerite
Cu7S4 ( Cu1.75S ) , anilite
Cu9S5 ( Cu1.8S ) , digenite
Cu58S32 ( Cu1.8S ) , roxbyite
Cu31S16 ( Cu1.96S ) , djurleite
Cu2S , chalcocite
Classes of copper sulfides
Copper sulfides can be classified into three groups :
Monosulfides , 1.6 ≤ Cu/S ≤ 2 : their crystal structures consist of isolated sulfide anions that are closely related to either hcp or fcc lattices , without any direct S-S bonds . The copper ions are distributed in a complicated manner over interstitial sites with both trigonal and distorted tetrahedral coordination and are rather mobile . Therefore , this group of copper sulfides shows ionic conductivity at slightly elevated temperatures . In addition , the majority of its members are semiconductors .
Mixed monosulfide and disulfide compounds of copper contain both monosulfide ( S2− ) and disulfide ( S2 ) n− anions . Their crystal structures usually consist of alternating hexagonal layers of monosulfide and disulfide anions with Cu cations in trigonal and tetrahedral interstices . CuS , for example , can be written as Cu3 ( S2 ) S. Several nonstoichiometric compounds with Cu : S ratios between 1.0 and 1.4 also contain both monosulfide and disulfide ions . Depending on their composition , these copper sulfides are either semiconductors or metallic conductors .
At very high pressures , a copper disulfide , CuS2 , can be synthesized . Its crystal structure is analogous to that of pyrite , with all sulfur atoms occurring as S-S units . Copper disulfide is a metallic conductor due to the incomplete occupancy of the sulfur p band . Different stoichiometric compositions can be obtained by changing the redox atmosphere of the synthetic environment . [ 6 ]
Oxidation states of copper and sulfur
The bonding in copper sulfides can not be correctly described in terms of a simple oxidation state formalism because the Cu-S bonds are somewhat covalent rather than ionic in character , and have a high degree of delocalization resulting in complicated electronic band structures . Although many textbooks ( e.g . ) give the mixed valence formula ( Cu+ ) 2 ( Cu2+ ) ( S2− ) ( S2 ) 2− for CuS , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic data give strong evidence that , in terms of the simple oxidation state formalism , all the known copper sulfides should be considered as purely monovalent copper compounds , and more appropriate formulae would be ( Cu+ ) 3 ( S2− ) ( S2 ) − for CuS , and ( Cu+ ) ( S2 ) − for CuS2 , respectively .
Further evidence that the assignment of the so-called `` valence hole '' should be to the S2 units in these two formulae is the length of the S-S bonds , which are significantly shorter in CuS ( 0.207 nm ) and CuS2 ( 0.203 nm ) than in the `` classical '' disulfide Fe2+ ( S2 ) 2− ( 0.218 nm ) . This bond length difference has been ascribed to the higher bond order in ( S-S ) − compared to ( S-S ) 2− due to electrons being removed from a π * antibonding orbital . NMR studies on CuS show that there are two distinct species of copper atom , one with a more metallic nature than the other . This apparent discrepancy with the X-ray photo-electron spectrum data simply highlights the problem that NMR has in assigning oxidation states in a mixed-valence compound . The issue of the valence of copper in sulfides ( as well as selenides and tellurides ) continues to be revisited in the literature . A good example is a 2009 study of the ternary compound CuCo2S4 ( a spinel mineral known as carrollite ) that `` was undertaken primarily to establish unequivocally the oxidation state of the Cu in the mineral '' and concluded `` that the experimental and simulated Cu L2,3 absorption spectra established an unequivocal oxidation state of CuI in the carrollite bulk '' .

Women in Informal Employment : Globalizing and Organizing ( WIEGO ) is a Manchester-based global research - policy network focused on improving conditions for workers in the informal economy . WIEGO 's members include membership-based organizations of workers in the informal economy , researchers and development professionals .
The WIEGO network was founded in 1997 by a group of ten activists , researchers , and development practitioners , following a specialist 's meeting on the informal economy in Bellagio , Italy . Among the founders was Professor Martha Chen , a Harvard Lecturer in Public Policy and currently a senior advisor with the network . The founding steering committee chair was Indian civil rights leader Dr. Ela Bhatt .
In July 2007 , WIEGO was registered as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee in the UK ( WIEGO Ltd. ) with a formal Constitution and Articles of Association . In 2011 , WIEGO was granted charity status by the Charity Commission for England and Wales ( Registered Charity No . 1143510 ) .
Mission and Goals
WIEGO 's stated mission : `` WIEGO believes all workers should have equal economic opportunities and rights and be able to determine the conditions of their work and lives . WIEGO works to improve the status of the working poor , especially women , in the informal economy through increased organization and representation ; improved statistics and research ; more inclusive policy processes ; and more equitable trade , labour , urban , and social protection policies . ''
WIEGO 's objectives , as detailed in the Register of Charities , are `` to relieve poverty in particular the poverty of the working poor in the informal economy caused by low earnings , high risks , and adverse working environments and conditions associated with the informal economy worldwide ( including non-standard or unprotected employment for formal firms ) ''
Programmes and Activities
WIEGO supports working poor women by aiming to ensure they have adequate information , knowledge and tools and can mobilize around their rights , enhancing their safety and their earnings .
WIEGO does not set an agenda but rather support domestic workers , street vendors , waste pickers , garment workers , smallholder farmers and others are in articulating their own demands and participating directly in policy and planning processes .
Specific Research and Action
WIEGO commissions research that focuses on improving statistics on , and analyzing policies relating to , the working poor who make their living in the informal economy . Membership-based organizations ( MBOs ) of informal workers always involved in the identification , prioritization and design of WIEGO activities .
Impact of Global Recession : In 2009 and again in 2010 , WIEGO coordinated Global Economic Crisis studies to determine how informal workers were being affected by the global economic downturn . The study was executed by organizations involved in the global Inclusive Cities project , which is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . Two rounds of interviews and focus groups were conducted with 102 home-based workers , 63 street vendors and 54 waste pickers in 14 cities across Africa , Asia and Latin America . In 2009 , 77 % of respondents reported their incomes had fallen in recent months , while 52 % reported another decrease between mid-2009 and 2010 .
Findings from the first study , completed in 2009 , are captured in `` No Cushion to Fall Back On : The Global Economic Crisis and Informal Workers ] '' . Findings from the second study are found in `` Coping with Crises : Lingering Recession , Rising Inflation , and the Informal Workforce '' ion=submit # '' / >
Domestic Workers ' Rights : From 2009-2011 , funding from the Government of the Netherlands MDG3 Fund allowed WIEGO to assist domestic workers in their struggle for an international convention that would help secure their rights as workers . WIEGO helped establish the International Domestic Workers ' Network ( IDWN ) , and provided technical and strategic advice , research and capacity building , as well as assisting the IDWN in fund raising . Such practical support allowed domestic workers to represent themselves at the International Labour Conference ( ILC ) in 2010 and 2011 . On June 16 , 2011 governments , employers and workers from around the world adopted the Convention and accompanying Recommendation on Decent Work for Domestic Workers ( Convention 189 ) at the 100th ILC in Geneva , Switzerland .
Structure
WIEGO represents a collaboration between membership-based organizations of workers in the informal economy , support non-governmental organizations , research and statistics institutions , national governments , and international development agencies .
Membership-based organizations of informal workers that are actively involved with WIEGO are asked to become Institutional Members . Individuals from the other two constituencies who are involved with WIEGO can become Individual Members . As of March 2014 , the WIEGO network had 172 Members – 33 Institutional and 139 Individual Members – from 40 countries .
A 10-person Board of Directors governs the WIEGO network . Board members are drawn from WIEGO 's three constituencies . The Board has two committees : a Management ( or executive ) Committee and a Financial Committee .

Ellis , Beggs & Howard ( EBH ) are an English pop music band formed in London in 1987 . Its members are Simon Ellis ( born 18 May 1961 in Yorkshire ) , Nick Beggs ( born 15 December 1961 in Buckinghamshire ) and Austin Howard ( born 22 July 1965 in London ) .
Career
Ellis , Beggs & Howard are made up of Simon Ellis ( keyboards and programming ) , Nick Beggs ( bass guitar and Chapman stick ) , and Austin Howard ( vocals ) . They were augmented by Paul Harvey on guitar , Robbie France on drums and Harry Sutcliffe on keyboards and programming . They experimented with several other guitarists , including Marty Williamson , Keith Airey and Sabu Bugaban .
EBH started in late 1987 by playing a few low-key gigs in London . They featured in the NME sponsored shows at The Greyhound in Fulham , and a performance at the nightclub Heaven , and later in bigger arenas .
EBH found success in Continental Europe . Their first single , `` Big Bubbles , No Troubles '' ( produced by Ralph Ruppert and Lux ) , was a hit in 1988 , receiving several awards in many countries . On the UK Singles Chart , the single reached number 41 .
After the failure of their first album , Homelands , in the United Kingdom , and despite its success elsewhere in Europe , tensions in the band became overwhelming . Nevertheless , from 1989 they recorded the basic tracks of what was to have been their second album with the Fleetwood Mac Mobile , at the Eazee Hire rehearsal complex in London . The album was not released by a label at the time , although Beggs made it available several years later as a home-grown CDr release entitled The Lost Years Vol . 1 . The album is notable for contributions from Warren Cuccurullo and Robert Fripp .

Tandiono Manu ( 28 June 1913 – 30 October 1986 ) was an Indonesian politician who served as Minister of Agriculture in the Natsir Cabinet between 1950 and 1951 , and Minister of Trade and Industry within the Halim Cabinet of the Republic of Indonesia during the United States of Indonesia period .
Early life and education
Tandiono was born in Banyuwangi , today in East Java , on 28 June 1913 . They were an only child , and their father Martoprawiro worked as an irrigation department official . They completed elementary school ( Hollandsch-Inlandsche School ) in Jember and secondary school ( Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs ) in Surabaya , before continuing to the Rechtshogeschool ( law institute ) in Batavia . They graduated from there in 1941 . During their studies , they were active in youth organizations such as Jong Java and the Unitas Studiorum Indonesiensis .
Career
The Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies began shortly after Tandiono 's graduation , and they initially worked in a tax office before they were reassigned as judiciary of the military administration , serving in Semarang . They continued to work in the court system following the proclamation of Indonesian independence , initially in Yogyakarta , until they were appointed resident of Bojonegoro in 1947 . They participated in guerrilla warfare against the Dutch following Operation Kraai . During this period , they were also active in Barisan Tani Indonesia , the principal peasant organization of the country .
After the transfer of sovereignty , they were briefly appointed as vice governor of East Java ( on 1 January 1950 ) until their appointment as Minister of Trade and Industry in the Halim Cabinet on 21 January . After the United States of Indonesia was dissolved , they became Minister of Agriculture in the Natsir Cabinet , as a member of the Indonesian Socialist Party . They were later appointed as a director in the Indonesian subsidiary of the plantation firm . They enjoyed a close relationship with their predecessor and then-sitting minister Sadjarwo Djarwonagoro , and British firms at the time were attempting to cultivate relationships with the Indonesian government .
During the New Order period , they took part in a political discussion group which involved Islamists , former generals ( such as Tahi Bonar Simatupang ) , and other political figures . They died on 30 October 1986 and was buried at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery .

Crapo Park ( 85 acres , 34 hectares ) is a city park with arboretum and botanical garden , alongside the Mississippi River at Parkway Drive , Burlington , Iowa . Those who are not familiar with the park often mispronounce it as `` crap-oh '' Park , with the correct pronunciation being ( ) Park .
It is reputed to be the site where the American flag was first raised on Iowa 's soil , by Zebulon Pike in 1805 .
The park includes an arboretum containing more than 200 varieties of trees and shrubs , as well as botanical gardens of annuals and perennials . As of 2003 , the following park trees were on Iowa 's statewide `` Big Tree '' list : Arizona cypress ( Cupressus arizonica ) , black hickory ( Carya glabra ) , pawpaw ( Asimina triloba ) , and black walnut ( Juglans nigra ) .
Background
The park was established in 1895 by Philip Crapo , a local business person and philanthropist , in time for the Iowa semi-centennial ( 1896 ) , with landscape engineering by Earnshaw and Punshon of Cincinnati , Ohio . The park includes walking paths and four shelters , as well as Lake Starker ( constructed 1905 , , 0.6 hectares ) , the Hawkeye Natives Log Cabin ( replica constructed 1910 ) , Zebulon Pike Memorial , and Foehlinger Fountain . It also includes the Black Hawk Spring and Cave , commemorating Chief Black Hawk . One can crawl for more than a hundred feet through a rock tube before the passage gets too small . A cold spring runs through the cave as well . The neighboring Dankwardt Park is popular with frisbee-golf enthusiasts .
One of the primary downsides of the park is the narrow roads that wind through it , the road width , and the brick drainages on either side , which taper rather sharply , can sometimes be a hazard , especially when a driver gets their tires stuck in the drainages .
The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 .
In 2007 , Main Street was blocked off while crews attempted to repair or replace the aging 150-year-old Cascade Bridge , which leads to the park ; As of November , 2020 , the bridge remains closed .

Portuguese Tangier ( ; ) covers the period of Portuguese rule over Tangier , today a city in Morocco . The territory was ruled by the Kingdom of Portugal from 1471–1661 .
History
Before Portugal succeeded in capturing the territory , Portugal failed to capture Tangier in 1437 , 1458 , and 1464 but captured it in 1471 following the Conquest of Asilah . The Portuguese built multiple European-style houses during this period . The Wattasids then attempted to invade it in 1508 , 1511 and 1515 without success .
In 1661 , Tangier was given to England as dowry of Charles II of England when they married Catherine of Braganza , beginning the Battle of Tangier between England and Moroccan forces , eventually ending with Moroccan victory .

The 1991–92 Illinois Fighting Illini men 's basketball team represented the University of Illinois .
Regular season
Illinois ' consecutive 20-win season streak was snapped in 1992 when the Illini posted its first losing record in 14 years , going 13-15 . Despite their losing record , the Illini outscored their opponents by over 100 points during the season ( 1,954 - 1,843 ) . To emphasize how close the Illini were to a successful season , of the eleven Big Ten conference games that they lost , eight were by nine points or fewer , of which four games were lost by three points or fewer . Based on the allegations of recruiting violations from Iowa assistant coach Bruce Pearl , the most satisfying win during the conference season took place on February 23 , 1992 , when the Illini would defeat the Hawkeyes in an overtime thriller at Assembly Hall .

Africa 's Next Top Model is a reality television show and spin-off to America 's Next Top Model . It follows the format of the original version , and documents a competition in which a number of aspiring models compete for the title of Africa 's Next Top Model and a chance to start a career in the modeling industry . The show is hosted by model Oluchi Onweagba , and features contestants from countries in Africa .
The first season ( `` cycle '' ) aired on Africa Magic from November 2013 to January 2014 . The winner of the competition was 20-year-old Aamito Lagum , who represented Uganda .
Controversy
West Africa 's Next Top Model
In 2008 , a similar adaptation titled West Africa 's Next Top Model was planned and would have featured contestants originating from the West African countries of Côte d'Ivoire , Ghana , Sierra Leone , Senegal , Liberia and Nigeria . The competition was also supposed to be hosted by Oluchi Onweagba . Auditions began in March 2009 , but due to unknown reasons , the series was left without a station and never aired , and no contestants were selected . On 12 February 2016 , a federal high court in Abuja dismissed preliminary objections regarding a ₦780 billion copyright lawsuit by Chudi Charles , CEO of International Pageant and Films , against Onweagba for infringing their West Africa 's Next Top Model trademark , which they had registered in 2003 ; After filing the lawsuit against Onweagba , as well as the Nigerian Copyright Commission , Etisalat Nigeria , Guinness Nigeria Plc , Mtech , Multichoice Nigeria and CBS , Onweagba and the other defendants filed an objection in which they argued that they had obtained the rights to host Africa 's Next Top Model from Tyra Banks , the executive producer and host of America 's Next Top Model . The objection was dismissed after the defendants were unable to produce a superior title to back up their claims of ownership .

The Battle of Little Mountain , also known as Estill 's Defeat , was fought on March 22 , 1782 , near Mount Sterling in what is now Montgomery County , Kentucky . One of the bloodiest engagements of the Kentucky frontier , the battle has long been the subject of controversy resulting from the actions of one of Captain James Estill 's officers , William Miller , who ordered a retreat that left the rest of Estill 's command to be overwhelmed by the attacking Wyandots .
Background
On March 19 , 1782 , Captain James Estill received a message from Colonel Benjamin Logan requesting assistance after signs of a Wyandot war party had been seen near Boonesborough , in addition to empty canoes having been seen floating down the Kentucky River . Gathering about 40 men from nearby settlements , Estill began searching the area .
While they were away , the Wyandots attacked a number of nearby settlements , including Estill 's Station , killing 14-year-old Jennie Glass and capturing Munk ( or Monk ) Estill , a slave who belonged to James Estill . Under interrogation , the courageous slave was able to persuade the Wyandots to hold off their attack , convincing them that Estill 's Station was at full strength . ( In reality , with the exception of one man on the sick list , only women and children were present at the fort . ) After killing a number of cattle , the Wyandots fled across the river .
As soon as the Indians retreated , Samuel South and Peter Hackett , both young men , were dispatched to find Captain Estill and inform them of the attacks . They found Estill near the mouth of Drowning Creek and Red River early in the morning of March 21 . About half of Estill 's 40 men had left families at the fort . They returned to Estill 's Station that same day and Estill soon returned with the rest . They ordered five men to remain at Estill 's Station and led the others in pursuit of the Indian raiding party . They set up camp at Little Mountain , near present-day Mt . Sterling . Resuming the chase the next morning , Estill was forced to leave behind 10 more men whose horses were too tired to continue . Finding fresh tracks , Estill and the 25 men remaining soon overtook the Wyandots at Little Mountain Creek .
Battle
On the night of March 22 , 1782 , Estill and their militiamen encountered the Wyandot raiding party . Separated by Little Mountain Creek , they were a mile and a half north of Little Mountain . The two sides fought in a violent , pitched battle for nearly two hours . The Wyandot leader , Sourehoowah , was reportedly shot by the first volley and urged their men to continue fighting as they lay dying .
After firing at each other across the creek for some time , both sides had suffered heavy casualties . When the Wyandots began fording Little Mountain Creek , Estill countered by dividing their forces into three groups . Estill took the right flank , the left being given to Lieutenant William Miller , while Ensign David Cook held the center .
Miller was ordered to flank the rear of the Wyandots from the left . As they prepared to lead their men into battle , a musket ball apparently hit their rifle , knocking the flint from the jaws of the lock . Miller allegedly shouted that `` it was foolhardy to stay and be shot down , '' so they fled the scene with their men following him .
With Estill 's left flank now open and the creek defended by only four men , the Wyandots easily rushed in , killing Estill and six others as the militiamen retreated . Estill had already been wounded three times . As they attempted to escape with their men , they were killed in hand-to-hand combat by a pursuing Wyandot warrior . Militiaman Joseph Proctor witnessed Estill 's death and shot the attacker dead with their rifle .
Only a handful of men is left on each side , and the battle ended with the Kentuckians withdrawing from the field . Those Kentuckians who had been captured reported later that the Wyandots had suffered about 20 casualties . Monk Estill , who had escaped during the battle , reported that 17 Wyandots had been killed and two more wounded . This was confirmed by another prisoner who later escaped . Among the 18 Kentuckians who survived the battle at Little Mountain were frontiersman James Anderson , David Lynch , and William Irving . Adam Caperton , the father of United States Congressman Hugh Caperton , was killed .
Aftermath
William Miller became the scapegoat for both the Kentuckians ' defeat and the death of Captain Estill . One of the survivors , David Cook , reportedly threatened their life 20 years after the battle . Miller never returned to Estill 's Station to defend themselves against their accusers .
Monk Estill won particular distinction for bravery during the battle , having carried a wounded militiaman , James Berry , almost back to Estill 's Station . They were granted their freedom soon afterwards by Wallace Estill , becoming the first slave to be freed in Kentucky .
The traditional site of Estill 's death is marked by a millstone marker pointing to an old sycamore tree on Hinkston Creek .
In 1808 Estill County , Kentucky , was named for Captain James Estill .

Road powered electric vehicles ( RPEV ) ( sometimes called roadway powered electric vehicles ) collect any form of potential energy from the road surface to supply electricity to locomotive motors and ancillary equipment within the vehicle .
Definition
A Road Powered electric vehicle may be defined as a transport capsule with the following characteristics :
The principal means of locomotion is one or more electric motor ( s )
The electric motors are powered by an electrical supply provided either from a battery ( usually on-board ) or power source ( typically remote , and connected directly via conductive cables or magnetic inductive fields
There is a defined roadway over which the vehicle travels ( that means , although it may have some on-board battery reserve , is not intended to be a cross-country vehicle )
Where an external electric supply is provided , this is typically with overhead conductors or above-ground rails or ( rarely ) sub-surface electro-magnets .
An all-electric vehicle typically requires one or more on-board energy supply elements or devices for autonomous operation , most commonly by chemical batteries , less frequently via electro-mechanical generators
The electric vehicle further may include an on-board control system that directs energy from the energy storage elements , as needed , and converts such energy to electric motors used to propel the electric vehicle .
A Road Powered Electric Vehicle therefore necessarily includes a system for supplying electricity from an external power source ( such as a remote power station ) through a network of power coupling elements which provide an integral and continuous power connection between origin and destination .
Wireless energy transfer
In the USA Patent 6421600 these power coupling elements are electro-magnetic transmission coils embedded in the roadway and reception coils which are electrically resonant , so that they convert the magnetic flux above the road into electrical energy on the vehicle , which is entirely independent , since there is no mechanical or electrical link . The patent version of RPEV cited also includes :
an on-board power meter to indicate the approximate consumption and an approximation of its remaining autonomous ( battery ) endurance or ranger range
a wide bandwidth communications channel to allow information signals to be sent to , and received from , the RPEV while it is in use ;
automated garaging , a system that automatically connects power to the RPEV when it is in storage overnight , both to recharge the on-board batteries and power the on-board storage heater in cold weather so that it is comfortable for the driver and passengers .
electronic coupling between two or more RPEVs so that one can be a `` master '' ( with a driver ) and the following vehicle ( s ) are `` slave '' ( controlled by the driver in the `` master '' vehicle ) as a sort of `` road train '' in order to increase passenger or payload capacity .
a positioning system for determining the current location of the RPEV ; and
a scheduling and dispatch computer so that many RPEV 's can be accommodated efficiently on any particular length of road with embedded transmission coils . Such a system could be adapted for use with remote drivers or automatic control over closed roadway circuits such as warehouses and theme parks .
Online Electric Vehicles ( OHVs ) use pick-up equipment underneath the vehicle then collects power through non-contact magnetic induction , which may imply a similar electrical design .
Wired energy transfer
Trolleybuses use overhead cables which could also be used for cars , as shown in a photograph ( right ) carried by an encyclopedic magazine about 1910 .
Overhead power lines
The twin overhead power lines are usually copper conductors with a flat surface , which are supported by a steel catenary wire . A pole or pantograph extends from the vehicle and presses 'slippers ' or 'skates ' against the conductors to complete the circuit . These slipper or skate contacts are frequently coated with graphite , or have a carbon block to reduce friction and ensure a good ( low resistance ) electrical connection .
Since buses are scheduled , traffic conflicts are rare . If the overhead dual power line infrastructure was used randomly by private users , then some sort of management system would be required . The simplest would be to provide the vehicles some limited autonomy so that they could simply disconnect when arriving at each intersection and reconnect when they joined the next section . A more sophisticated traffic management system , as proposed by the USA Patent 6421600 ( above ) could facilitate transit where there are many vehicles wishing to draw power from a particular section of the infrastructure .
Recent improvements in trolleybus design include the automatic connection and disconnection of power poles either by the driver or in the event of mechanical dis-engagement from the overhead wires , so that the driver can remain in control , using on-board battery power . Better materials and motion dynamics modeling allow speeds up to about 80 km/h so that trolleybus behavior is flexible and totally comparable with regular autonomous vehicle performance , even at crossings and road-junctions
Ground-level power supply
Ground-level power supply is an alternative to overhead power lines . The most common version is the conduit current collection system , where the power supply is carried in a channel or vault under the roadway . This is a tube , open at the top to allow a blade to enter and extend slippers against the power conductors , which are either side of the access opening slot , near the top of the channel . The arrangement is shaped so that live surfaces can not be reached by hand , and the lower part of the conduit provides drainage to remove any water .
Conduit power was first designed in the steam age ( c.1900 ) when power was transmitted mechanically from a series of steam-powered rotating screws , as shown in the illustration ( left ) also published by Harmsworth Popular Science .
A more recent roadway power supply design used by the Bordeaux tramway involves alternate ( line and neutral ) panels which are only powered whilst they are actually under the tram . This system is called APS ( French : Alimentation par Sol which implies sub-surface power feed in English ) .

A parking area with an overhead electrical net was in use at Seoul Grand Park Zoo in South Korea , to recharge electric vehicles , This was similar to a fairground bumper car arrangement which allowed vehicle batteries to be recharged , prior to introduction of the more modern OLEV Online Electric Vehicle system . The advantage was that vehicles could be parked randomly , as convenient , and there was no need for either the tripping hazard of trailing cables used by most electric vehicles nor for fiddly precise alignment of conductor poles needed by trolley buses .
Linear Motor Propulsion
An alternative form of electro-magnetic coupling is called a linear motor , first developed by Professor Eric Laithwaite at Imperial College London in the 1960s .
Instead of supplying electric motors with power directly or charging on-board batteries , the RPEV is fitted with magnets which are impelled horizontally in the same way as the rotor on an ordinary electric motor is impelled to rotate . A linear motor works in exactly the same way a round motor which has been split to its centre , laid flat and extended .
The Shanghai Transrapid and Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit systems are practical examples of this type of RPEV technology applied to rail transport systems ( which are sometimes called railroads , especially in the USA ) .
Maglev uses magnetic repulsion to support the carriage weight as well as to propel the vehicle forward , so wheels are not needed . Maglev trains effectively ride on top of a magnetic wave , much as a surfer rides a wave on the sea .

Bonnie 's Bookstore is a word-forming puzzle video game developed by New Crayon Games and published by PopCap Games . On each level , tiles containing one ( or in some cases , two ) letters are arranged in a specific structure . As in the similar title Bookworm , players use adjacent letters to form valid words , with points being awarded based on the length of the word . In most cases , once a letter is used , it is removed from the board , with existing letters moving downwards and new letters filling in from the top .
Plot
In Bonnie 's Bookstore , the titular character runs a bookstore which they have inherited from their deceased grandfather . One day while cleaning the attic , they discover a series of paintings apparently created by him . The paintings appear to depict scenes from popular children 's stories . In a flash of inspiration , Bonnie decides to become an author , writing updated versions of these classic stories while using their grandfather 's paintings as the illustrations .
Each of the 50 stages in the game represents a chapter in a book . After completing a certain number of chapters , Bonnie finishes the book she 's working on , receiving a congratulatory letter from their publisher and moving on to the next . Bonnie writes a variety of tales , especially fairy tales . Usually , each book is three chapters long .
In order to complete a given level or stage , Bonnie must use a letter from each physical location of the board . Creating a word with a tile which has not previously been used causes the color of the tile at that position to change . Bonnie has only a limited number of turns or moves ( with each word consuming one turn ) to use every tile position on the board . Creating a word with 6 or more letters adds an extra turn for each letter after 5 letters . At higher difficulty levels , more points are awarded , but the allowed number of turns decreases .
Reception
The website Gamezebo remarked that , despite similarities with existing titles ( including PopCap 's own Bookworm ) , Bonnie 's Bookstore redeemed itself through fun and challenging gameplay . As a result , it received a score of 3.5 out of 5 . The reviewer at GameDaily likened the title to Scrabble , but found the gameplay both rewarding and addictive , landing it a `` Perfect 10 '' score .

The William Berry residence is a heritage-listed detached house at 1 Burnett Street , West Ipswich , City of Ipswich , Queensland , Australia . It was built . It is also known as William Berry residence . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 .
History
The residence at 1 Burnett Street , West Ipswich , is a brick house built for William Berry .
The allotment on which this residence is situated was first purchased on 11 May 1855 as allotment 101 , parish of Ipswich , county Stanley ( 1r 32.5p ) , by William Berry at a cost of £35 . Berry was an Ipswich district farmer who was born in Aberdeenshire , Scotland , and by 1843 was resident in the Moreton Bay region . In March of that year they were one of the signatories to a petition to Sir George Gipps , Governor of New South Wales , requesting the sale of Crown Lands in the Moreton Bay area to be transferred from Sydney to Brisbane where the petitioners , `` being Men of limited Capital '' , could afford to attend to purchase allotments . The appeal proved to no avail and in the subsequent Crown auction held in Sydney on 11 October 1843 Berry was among the first purchasers of Ipswich allotments . It is not clear exactly when Berry moved to Ipswich , however they were reputedly living there by 1848 and quickly acquired a distinct local patriotism . In 1849 , they signed a petition that urged the then New South Wales Governor , Sir Charles Augustus Fitzroy , not to introduce more than a fair proportion of Crown prisoners to the Ipswich and Moreton Bay region on the grounds that their presence in the area would reduce the future prosperity of the district . Twelve years later Berry was again placing their signature to a petition , this time objecting to the incorporation of Ipswich as a municipality , which the petitioners believed `` would be impolitic and injurious to the interests of the inhabitants '' .
Although extant records indicate Berry was a farmer by occupation , it is known that they were also a landowner and was referred to in their death documents as a freeholder . Between 1852 and 1854 they purchased three town lots in Cleveland , Brisbane , and in August 1866 the title to 2 Burnett Street was transferred to Berry . By 1870 , Berry had also acquired Lots 98 and 99 next to 2 Burnett Street , and the area generally became known as Berry 's Hill . Ipswich Municipal Council Valuation Registers indicate they utilized these allotments as their garden and they resided in a modest timber cottage at 1 Burnett Street until when Council records show a brick house was built on the property .
The construction of this larger residence was indicative of both Berry 's burgeoning financial status and the increasing economic prosperity of the Ipswich region during the mid to late 1870s . It was an impressive house which Berry described , in an advertisement for sale in September 1886 , as having a slate roof , eight rooms , kitchen , servant 's room , bathroom and bath , large underground tank , two-stalled stable , buggy shed , wash house and other offices . In April the following year , Berry died suddenly at their Burnett Street house , aged 76 years .
Following Berry 's death the property was held in trust by their wife , Margaret Berry , and George Miles Challinor , a clerk of Esk , until July 1889 when title to the land was transferred to William Berry 's son , Alexander , although Margaret Berry appears to have remained as occupant of the house .
By March 1900 , title to the property had been transferred to Paul Marcel Terlier who retained title to the property until 1945 . During this period the allotment was subdivided , with one subdivision sold to the then owners of 2 Burnett Street , Sophia Helena Lewis and Norman Lewis , for use as a garden . The house remained on a reduced parcel of 24 perches and four-tenths of a perch . It was also during Terlier 's ownership of 1 Burnett Street that the house was reputedly divided into flats and the verandahs enclosed with fibro sheeting .
In the 30 years after 1945 , the property passed between 5 owners , until 1974 when it was registered in the name of Allan and Lily Maude Whybird . Allan Whybird had served as an alderman on the Ipswich City Council in 1964 and as Deputy Mayor between 1970 and 1973 . They were also the grandson of John Whybird who established the first removalist company in Ipswich in 1857 . The Whybirds carried out some internal renovations during their 10 years of ownership and replaced the original balustrading on the upper verandah with cast iron inserts obtained from the local branch of the Bank of New South Wales , which was demolished in the second half of the 20th century . By 1984 , the property was used as a shelter for homeless youths and was owned by the Ipswich Independent Youth Service , before passing into the hands of new owners , who restored the building to its original function as a family home .
Description
The house at 1 Burnett Street sits on a compact allotment , at a corner with Omar Street , approximately from Ipswich town centre . It occupies a prominent position on a hill overlooking a wide expanse of the town . It is clearly visible at a distance when travelling along Limestone St and from the northern end of Burnett St where Ipswich Grammar School is located . There are a number of other houses on the eastern section of Burnett Street that are entered on Queensland 's Heritage Register , including Idavine on the adjacent allotment and Notnel at 6 Burnett Street . Across the street , much timber vernacular cottages have been converted into a single restaurant .
The original house of rendered and painted brick is sited in the front eastern corner of the 617 sqm lot . The render has been scored to create the illusion of large masonry blocks . Its main roof is hipped with a short-ridge and sheeted in corrugated iron . The timber verandahs face the two streets with the eastern verandah edge sitting on the fence-line and the other setback approximately . Their roof is continuous with the main roof at a slightly reduced pitch . The upper storey 's balustrading is cast iron obtained from elsewhere by the Whybirds . A number of balusters are missing , and some aluminium frieze pieces have been fitted around the lower storey . A photo taken late in the 19th century shows the original verandah edge made up of simple timber columns with capitals , carved brackets and horizontal pieces between them . One chimneystack protrudes from the main roof at the eastern end of the ridge and there is a lone acroterion decorating it . There is also a lone decorated soldered rainwater head fitted to the western face .
A flight of stairs rise through the verandah space overlooking Omar Street . They were likely built in the period prior to the end of the Second World War when the house was converted to flats . The stairs are screened with lattice and run between the two window rows on this facade .
One end of the gable-roofed , single storey kitchen abuts the main house on its southern facade . Its eastern face is in line with that of the main house . The steeply pitched corrugated iron roof has no overhang with the fascia fixed to the outer wall . This structure has painted brick walls and two hooded windows facing Omar Street and the east . The hoods are skillion with timber battening to the sides and a carved timber piece to the front . The two upper storey rear windows also have these hoods . The kitchen windows are sashed with 6 panes in each leaf . A sunroom , laundry and covered patio separate the kitchen structure from the small square of garden to the house 's west facing the neighbouring property . The sunroom 's walls appear to follow a similar scheme to the main house using scored render . A steel sheeted skillion roof ( Lysaght Klip-Lok profile ) covers both , having no gutters .
Access to the tiled lower-storey verandah is gained from Burnett Street up a short flight of concrete stairs . The front door has a pivoting glass fanlight and opens onto a central hallway divided in two by an arched opening . The walls are plastered brick and a scraping has revealed a two-part colour scheme ( light green atop dark , separated by a thin maroon band ) . Two rooms open to each side of this hallway . A set of stairs begins at its end and an opening to the sunroom fits under them . To the right are the living and dining spaces , which are joined by a broad archway . There is evidence that this wall was originally complete and featured a two-way fireplace , matching that which is found between the two rooms opening to the left of the hall . A section of brick chimneystack remains within the roof space . The ceilings are in height and lined with wide beaded tongue-and-groove boarding . The boarding features a central dummy bead . The hallway 's ceiling is lined in a similar manner .
A fibro sheet ceiling has been removed to reveal the ceilings boards , 2-part cornices and picture rail fitted at . The walls are plaster with a shaped timber skirting , matching the other rooms on this level of the main house . One window opens to the front and back of the house . They , as are all the others in the 8 main rooms are sash with 4 panes in each leaf . The windows and doors throughout feature painted timber architraves and reveals . The floors in the hallway , dining and living rooms are pine boards .
The two rooms opening to the left off the hallway are yet to have their fibro sheet ceilings removed . The mantelpiece to the fireplace in the front room is possibly polished Cedar , while the opposite one has been painted . It consists of a simple mantel top supported by two columns in relief . The arched cast register grates are still in place , the front rooms ' being painted white . In the rear room , used as a bedroom , the brick hearth extends some with slates laid under the grate . The front room 's hearth appears to be stone or concrete .
The stairs have been sanded back in places and appear to be made of Hoop Pine . They complete a 180-degree turn in making their way to the upper storey . Its layout reflects exactly that found below . The outer stringer is not continuous at the bend , suggesting some change has been made . A high window overlooks the stairwell . All internal walls are plaster as the ones below are . However the internal wall corresponding to that which separates the hall and living room below , has been breached to reveal boarding that matches the ceilings downstairs . There is matching joinery to all windows and doors . The room above the dining room has been converted into a bathroom . All ceilings are lined with fibro sheeting . They slope down to meet each external wall in a wide zone . The upper storey hall opens via a door onto the verandah . It is reported that the Whybirds lowered the level of this verandah , and this is evident in the three steps leading off this doorway . When this change occurred the original verandah timberwork was replaced . Bolts and nuts can be seen on the interior of certain walls where the verandah roof has been tied back .
On the ground floor , from the rear of the central hallway opens the sunroom . To the left are two doors leading through a thick wall to the large kitchen . Above the doors are fixed frames of rough painted lattice . Its ceiling is lined as the living and dining rooms ' are and is sloped at each side . The boards at the south end of the flat section of the ceiling are all cut at a distance of approximately from the wall . This might suggest the existence of an earlier hearth . In the sunroom , on the wall shared with the main part of the house is a faintly visible curved line suggesting a curved roof may have been removed when the skillion was constructed . The line stops short of the current width of the sunroom .
Grounds
The fences to both streets consist of small columns and a base of concrete blocks cast to resemble rough-hewn stone . They are capped by red clay-bricks with bullnose edges that are laid stretcher face down . Between the columns of the Omar Street fence are fitted painted steel frames with bracing .
A two-storey pavilion , said to have been built by the Whybirds , occupies the rear western corner of the allotment , which is believed to be previously the site of the stables . On the ground floor is a double garage accessed by a driveway coming off Omar Street . Above this are bedrooms . A set of stairs and awning roof connect the pavilion with the covered patio attached to the sunroom .

Canadians for A Safe Learning Environment ( CASLE ) , formerly known as Citizens for A Safe Learning Environment , was a Registered Canadian Charity founded in 1992 , and based in Nova Scotia , Canada . The organization closed in 2018 .
History
CASLE began as a community organization in 1992 , by parents/teachers Corinne W. Harland ( b.1956- d.2020 ) , Karen L H Robinson , Debbie Hum ( went on to become a Halifax City Councilor for District 16 ) , Kim Given , and Elaine Courtney , who saw that their children 's schools had significant unaddressed and ongoing Health and Safety issues . These included long-recognized hazards such as asbestos and fuel leaks , but also health issues that were at the time largely unrecognized , such as effects from indoor mold growth and toxins in cleaning and maintenance materials . They soon recognized that school indoor air quality and Health and Safety issues were system-wide and extended across Canada , the Americas , and beyond .
CASLE became partner to governments and agencies . For the initial 15 years there was generalized name recognition from media coverage of CASLE 's work being accomplished , however , awareness of CASLE 's work eventually extended mostly to governments , unions , researchers , school decision-makers or other organizations that worked in the field of school health and safety .
The paper by Ontario 's Pollution Probe , Healthy Schools-Healthy Children : Improving the indoor Environment in Ontario Schools recommends other jurisdictions use Nova Scotia as a model ( p.49 ) , lists CASLE as an organization that “ had the ability to speak technically ” ( p. 33 ) , and “ The US EPA and the province of Nova Scotia have shown significant leadership in this regard. ” ( p. 52 ) Action items 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 & 9 were led by CASLE representatives for the government departments . ( p.32-33 , item 6.1.2 ) .
Contributions by CASLE include guidelines for design and construction of healthy new buildings . Also , CASLE contributed to practical knowledge and experience that indoor mold growth is unhealthy for building occupants , that toxic chemical use in every-day products needed to be changed to less-toxic alternatives , that hazardous materials such as asbestos and silica dust , lead-bearing paints , and much more , were being mishandled in schools . CASLE and Robinson produced reports for and with several Nova Scotia government departments .
CASLE was a complete volunteer organization , with no paid staff . All hands-on work was done by the board of directors . Other notable board members who served for extended periods over the years were Janice M. Moore , Avis J. Ratchford ( Degaust ) , Agnes M. Malouf , Sandra L. Moser , Mike Coughlan , and Kit ( Christopher ) Hood . Hood was co-creator of the three original Degrassi Junior High series and the feature-length “ School 's Out . ”

The bancor was a supranational currency that John Maynard Keynes and E. F. Schumacher conceptualised in the years 1940–1942 and which the United Kingdom proposed to introduce after World War II . The name was inspired by the French banque or ( 'bank gold ' ) . This newly created supranational currency would then be used in international trade as a unit of account within a multilateral clearing system—the International Clearing Union—which would also need to be founded .
Overview
John Maynard Keynes proposed an explanation for the ineffectiveness of monetary policy to stem the Great Depression , as well as a non-monetary interpretation of the depression , and finally an alternative to a monetary policy for meeting the depression . Keynes believed that in times of heavy unemployment , interest rates could not be lowered by monetary policies . The ability for capital to move between countries seeking the highest interest rate frustrated Keynesian policies . By closer government control of international trade and the movement of funds , the Keynesian policy would be more effective in stimulating individual economies .
Bancor would not be an international currency . It would rather be a unit of account used to track international flows of assets and liabilities , which would be conducted through the International Clearing Union . Gold could be exchanged for bancors , but bancors could not be exchanged for gold . Individuals could not hold or trade in bancor . All international trade would be valued and cleared in bancor . Surplus countries with excess bancor assets and deficit countries with excess bancor liabilities would both be charged to provide symmetrical incentives on them to take action to restore balanced trade . In the words of Benn Steil ,
Each item a member country exported would add bancors to its ICB account , and each item it imported would subtract bancors . Limits would be imposed on the amount of bancor a country could accumulate by selling more abroad than it bought , and on the amount of bancor debt it could rack up by buying more than it sold . This was to stop countries building up excessive surpluses or deficits . Each country 's limits would be proportional to its share of world trade ... Once initial limits had been breached , deficit countries would be allowed to depreciate , and surplus countries to appreciate their currencies . This would make deficit country goods cheaper , and surplus country goods more expensive , with the aim of stimulating a rebalancing of trade . Further bancor debit or credit position breaches would trigger mandatory action . For chronic debtors , this would include obligatory currency depreciation , rising interest payments to the ICB Reserve Fund , forced gold sales , and capital export restrictions . For chronic creditors , it would include currency appreciation and payment of a minimum of 5 percent interest on excess credits , rising to 10 percent on larger excess credits , to the ICB 's Reserve Fund . Keynes never believed that creditors would actually pay what in effect were fines ; rather , they believed they would take the necessary actions ... to avoid them .
Bretton Woods conference
Keynes was able to make their proposal the United Kingdom 's official proposal at the Bretton Woods Conference but it was not accepted . Rather than a supranational currency , the conference adopted a system of pegged exchange rates ultimately tied to physical gold in a system managed by the World Bank and IMF . In practice , the system implicitly established the United States dollar as a reserve currency convertible to gold at a fixed price on demand by other governments . The dollar was implicitly established as the reserve by the large trade surplus and gold reserves held by the United States at the time of the conference .
Proposed revival
Since the financial crisis of 2007–2008 Keynes 's proposal has been revived . Its proponents have argued that since the end of the Bretton Woods system when the United States dollar was unpegged from gold , the United States was incentivized to run high government spending and high deficits , which made the global financial system unstable . In a speech delivered in March 2009 entitled Reform the International Monetary System , Zhou Xiaochuan , the Governor of the People 's Bank of China called Keynes 's bancor approach `` farsighted '' and proposed the adoption of International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) special drawing rights ( SDRs ) as a global reserve currency as a response to the financial crisis of 2007–2010 . U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner expressed interest in the idea of greater use of SDRs as a reserve . However , they were criticized severely for this in the United States , and the dollar lost 5 cents against the euro in exchange markets following their statements . They and President Barack Obama shortly afterwards backtracked Geithner 's comments .
They argued that a national currency was unsuitable as a global reserve currency because of the Triffin dilemma—the difficulty faced by reserve currency issuers in trying to simultaneously achieve their domestic monetary policy goals and meet other countries ' demand for reserve currency . A similar analysis can be found in the Report of the United Nation 's `` Experts on reforms of the international monetary and financial system '' as well as in the IMF 's study published on 13 April 2010 .

Biography
Alldis was educated at King 's College School , Cambridge and Felsted . They then returned to King 's College , Cambridge as a choral scholar under Boris Ord from 1949 to 1952 .
After leaving Cambridge University , Alldis quickly became highly regarded as a choral conductor . In 1966 , the London Symphony Orchestra engaged them to form and direct its first standing choral group . However , they switched to the London Philharmonic Choir in 1969 , with which they remained until 1982 , preparing choruses for many celebrated performances with Adrian Boult , Otto Klemperer , Leopold Stokowski , Colin Davis , Bernard Haitink , Karl Richter , Georg Solti , and Zubin Mehta .
In 1962 , Alldis founded the professional , 16-member John Alldis Choir , which launched itself with the world premiere of Alexander Goehr 's A Little Cantata of Proverbs .

The choir also participated in many opera recordings for Decca and RCA , featuring artists such as Luciano Pavarotti , Plácido Domingo , Janet Baker , Joan Sutherland and Kiri Te Kanawa .
In 1970 , Alldis directed their choir in the recording and the first performance of Pink Floyd 's prog rock suite `` Atom Heart Mother '' . In 1973 , they directed the choir in the Westminster Abbey performance of Duke Ellington 's Third Sacred Concert—a recording that was to be the penultimate one made by the great bandleader . They also conducted the London Philharmonic Choir and brass section in the recording of David Bedford 's Star Clusters , available on the Classicprint label . In 1977 , they recorded Sounds of Glory for Arcade Records , a celebration of choral classics , which won a gold disc .
Alldis conducted a number of other ensembles , in music ranging from the Renaissance to the present . From 1966 to 1979 , they led the choir of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama . From 1971 to 1977 , they served as joint chief conductor of Radio Denmark , mainly leading its Danish State Radio Chorus . From 1979 to 1983 , they conducted the Groupe Vocal de France , recording music by Francis Poulenc and Gabriel Fauré . From 1989 to 1990 , they were music director and consultant for the Cameran Singers in Israel and briefly became guest conductor of the Hallé Choir in Manchester . From 1978 to 1987 , they conducted the American Choral Symposium in Manhattan , Kansas . From 1985 to 1998 , they were a permanent guest conductor with the Netherlands Chamber Choir , with whom they made several CDs including English Choral Music on the Globe label . From 1989 to 1997 , they guest-conducted the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus and the Central Philharmonic Society of China in Beijing . In 2002 , they conducted the Lyon Opera in the first performance of Messa Sulenna by the Corsican composer Jean-Paul Poletti . From 1975 to 2003 , John Alldis served on the Ralph Vaughan Williams Trust , and from 1971 to 2004 they conducted the Wimbledon Symphony Orchestra .

Gialova Lagoon ( , ) – also known as Divari , from the Latin word vivarium , meaning `` fishery '' – is a brackish body of water in the municipality of Pylos-Nestor , Greece , about north of Pylos . The lagoon , together with Voidokilia Bay , belongs to a unique ecosystem which constitutes a protected zone , in terms of both natural and cultural heritage . From the natural point of view , the entire area , together with Navarino Bay and the island of Sphacteria , forms part of the network Natura 2000 and has been named a Zone of Special Protection , with code GR2550008 , and an Area of EU Importance , with code GR2550004 .
Fauna
It serves as a wildlife habitat , particularly for migratory birds , which stop here first on their way from Africa to Northern Europe . A multitude of mammals , reptiles , amphibians and fish live there . Prominent among them is the African Chamelaeon , which is threatened by extinction . It is thought that this species came to the region during the Roman period , as it appears also in other regions of the Pax Romana , such as the Iberian peninsula , Malta and Cyprus .
Archaeology
The region has been proclaimed a zone of archaeological protection . It contains unique sites of archaeological interest , such as the tomb of Thrasymedes at Voidokoilia , the remains of Classical Pylos at Koryphasion , Palaiokastro or Palaionavarino , the cave of Nestor . In the 1960s at Yalova proper at the site called Divari , N. Yalouris , then director of the local archaeological service , excavated a Hellenistic necropolis . The excavations revealed several unspoiled shaft graves . Apart from the skeletal material , the graves were full of grave goods , mainly pottery , as well as coins , objects made of various metals and jewellery . Among these finds stand out a delta-shaped askos , known also as “ hot-water bottle ” , a clay sieve , a small aryballos made of faience and fish-plates . These finds are kept in the Archaeological Museum of Pylos .
Threats and protection
The lagoon had been endangered in the recent past due to plans to divert the rivers , and other sources of water that feed into the ecosystem and turn the area into arable land , but is now protected .

Elie Yossef ( also Eli Joseph , ) is a London-born Israeli educator and political activist .
Eli Yossef grew up in London and attended the Hasmonean High School where they established Betar England in 1973 . In 1975 , Yossef emigrated to Israel and served in the Golani and Paratroopers brigades of the Israel Defense Forces . After completing their military service , Yossef studied at Machon Meir and Hebrew University . In 1988 , Yossef founded a Youth Aliyah ( Aliyat haNoar ) high school for new immigrants from France . In 1997 , they organized a military preparatory program for Jewish students from abroad interested in volunteering in Israel 's army .
One of their major causes is freeing Jonathan Pollard . In January 2000 , Yossef conducted a hunger strike on Pollard 's behalf outside of Israel 's Parliament . They argued that anyone who passes classified information to the State of Israel regarding enemy intentions to harm Israel is morally innocent even if technically guilty by American law . In 2002 Yossef traveled to numerous Israeli high-schools and spoke of Pollard 's plight as a moral national issue . Yossef 's efforts to free Pollard has led them to collaborate with former Prisoners of Zion Natan Sharansky and Rabbi Yosef Mendelevitch over the years , highlighting the similarities between their situations in the Soviet Union and Pollard 's in the United States .
Yossef has urged the Israeli government to establish what happened to Raoul Wallenberg , a Swedish diplomat who saved countless Jews from the Holocaust during World War II but was arrested following the war by Soviet agents and disappeared .
Following the violent confrontation at Amona between the Israeli police and settler teenagers in early 2006 , Yossef led Mehi activists on a three-week hunger strike vigil protesting violence between Jews . The activists displayed banners and handed out fliers calling on the Israeli government and settler leadership to seek out ways to avoid future bloodshed .
Yossef has called on the government of Israel to cut diplomatic ties to Russia due to Russia 's involvement in Iran 's nuclear development program . Yossef told Israel National Radio 's Yishai Fleisher that `` the Jewish People must find the moral courage to stand up to super-powers in such situations . ''
Yossef actively opposed the Camp David Accords with Egypt and Israel 's subsequent withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula ) . Yossef has referred to themselves as a `` Humanitarian Zionist '' .
Yossef now works as a real estate agent . In August 2005 they founded the Eli Joseph Jerusalem Real Estate company .

The Cuban–American Treaty of Relations took effect on June 9 , 1934 . It abrogated the Treaty of Relations of 1903 .
Overview
The Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1934 replaced the Cuban–American Treaty of Relations ( 1903 ) in which Cuba committed to :
not permit a foreign power to obtain a naval base on the island
not go into excessive debt
grant the US the right to intervene in Cuba for the maintenance of ( an adequate ) government
approve all prior military actions by the United States
take measures to reduce infectious diseases
determine sovereignty over the Isle of Pines by a later treaty
lease lands for naval stations to the United States
The purpose of the 1903 treaty was to force Cuba to agree to recognize all U.S. military during its occupancy as lawful , to allow the U.S. to maintain and be able to quarantine their naval base in times of outbreak , and to allow the U.S. to intervene on behalf of Cuba so that it may preserve Cuban independence . However , the events that transpired in the decades after , such as the overthrow of the standing Cuban government , caused the United States government to re-evaluate and revise the initial treaty , in the form of the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1934 . The purpose of this was to maintain that Cuba would agree to recognize all prior U.S. military actions as lawful and allow the U.S. to maintain ( Article IV and Article V ) and be able to quarantine their naval base but to also nullify the provisions of the 1903 treaty , whereby the involvement of the United States in the affairs of the Cuban government impeded the sovereignty of Cuba .
The Cuban government expressed that the presence of a naval base on their island was a cause for concern on behalf of the sovereignty of the country . They argued that the right of the United States to establish naval bases in Cuba was self-granted , being both imposed and maintained by force . In addition , they argued that by being forced to lease and sell land to the United States , the Republic of Cuba was relinquishing territorial sovereignty , and thus the sovereignty of the nation was compromised .
Overthrow of the Cuban Government
The President of Cuba in 1933 was Gerardo Machado . At this time , there was a movement in opposition to Machado , to which they responded by using brutality . U.S. ambassador Benjamin Sumner Welles went to the American Embassy in Havana to advise Machado to restitute the constitutional guarantees . Machado rejected this advice and in the following months a large strike took place in Havana , and soon spread throughout the entire island . A conspiracy against Machado was discovered within the Cuban army and when Machado attempted to look into it , several officers informed them that unless they resigned , they risked intervention from the United States . Machado then resigned and fled the country . Carlos M. Céspedes took their place as the president .
Several weeks later , another uprising took place , by dissatisfied sergeants lead by Fulgencio Batista . They took control of the island and forced Céspedes and their cabinet out of the Presidential palace . Céspedes was replaced by Ramón Grau San Martín as the president .
The government under Ramón Grau San Martín was never recognized by the United States , and they were forced to resign in January of 1934 . The United States recognized the Cuban government under Carlos Mendieta , when they took the office of President on January 20th of 1934 .
Good Neighbor Policy
The Good Neighbor Policy was an idea that Franklin D. Roosevelt mentioned in their first inaugural address . The Good Neighbor Policy was a policy that opposed the involvement of the United States in the affairs of Latin American nations that Roosevelt implemented in efforts to improve relations with Latin America . In December of 1933 , Roosevelt declared : “ The definite policy of the United States from now on is one opposed to armed intervention . ”
Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1934
The Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1934 was signed in Washington on May 29th of 1934 . Most of the articles from the Platt Amendment were done away with . It contained five articles , which were conditions that the government of Cuba agreed to by signing . Article I stated that the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1903 would be abrogated . Article II , carried over from the 1903 treaty , stated that the Cuban government would deem previous military actions of the United States as lawful . Article III , also carried over from the 1903 treaty , stated that the government of Cuba would allow the United States to keep its naval stations , specifically the station in Guantanamo . Article IV stated that the Cuban government would acknowledge the right of the United States to quarantine its naval bases in the instance of the outbreak of disease . Article V stated that both governments agreed to ratify the treaty in Washington as soon as possible .
The 1934 treaty
In 1934 , a new Treaty of Relations replaced the 1903 Treaty of Relations . Articles IV and V of the 1903 Treaty were carried forward to the new Treaty : Cuba agreed to continue to recognize as lawful all prior military actions taken by the United States and it was agreed that the base could be quarantined in times of contagion . The lease for the Naval Station , contemplated in article VII of the 1903 Treaty , was recognized as having been agreed to and its provisions continuing .
One motivation for the 1934 Treaty of Relations was to remove the irritating provisions of the 1903 Treaty , as part of Franklin Roosevelt 's Good Neighbor Policy . Provisions of the 1903 Treaty were seen to be an affront to Cuban sovereignty .

The National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme ( NDORS ) is a scheme run in parts of the United Kingdom whereby certain drivers found committing a driving offence can be offered a training course as an alternative to prosecution .
Background
The idea of having re-education rather than prosecution for driving offences was first raised in the North Report in the late 1980s . The report stated that `` it must be in the public interest to rectify a fault rather than punish the transgressor '' and `` retraining of traffic offenders may lead to an improvement in their driving , particularly if their training is angled towards their failings '' .
The NDORS scheme is governed by guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers and endorsed by the Crown Prosecution Service .
In the year 2010–11 , 41 % of drivers caught speeding nationally took a course ; in the following year the figure rose to 54 % .
Course types and content
The ACPO guidance lists three types of course :
Safe and Considerate Driving ( for non-serious collisions and complaints by 3rd parties )
National speed awareness course ( for speeding up to 10 % + 9 mph over the speed limit )
What 's driving Us Course ( for conscious bad driving not resulting in a collision )
Each of these courses is designed to address different types of driver error , including offences such as speeding , driving without due care and attention , using a mobile phone and failing to wear a seat belt .
Availability of courses in England and Wales
Whilst all 43 police forces in England and Wales are members of the NDORS Schemes , not all police forces provide access to all of the courses offered and therefore an enquiry has to be made with the individual police force to determine whether or not they offer a driver retraining scheme for the offence which has been committed . This is with the exception of speeding , for which all police forces in England and Wales offer the National Speed Awareness Course .
Following Freedom of Information Request made by solicitors in 2015 , it has been established that the same courses are not offered by all 43 police forces across England and Wales .
Course delivery
Courses are offered at the discretion of the prosecuting authority – for example , the South Yorkshire Safety Camera Partnership state that `` although we do have the power to prosecute those who break the speed limit , we would rather persuade drivers to slow down '' .
Whilst offered on a discretionary basis , guidance is issued to the 43 police forces operating in England and Wales as to when a driver should be considered as eligible to attend a course . The current guidance is contained within a document entitled , `` National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme ( NDORS ) : Guidance on Eligibility Criteria for NDORS Courses . In addition to a consideration of the circumstances of the offence in determining whether or not a person is eligible to attend on a course , the guidance provides that the police should also consider the following :
Whether or not there is a realistic prospect of conviction i.e . is there evidence that the person has committed the offence
There is no other offence committed i.e . it is a single offence
A similar course has not been attended within three years for a similar offence
The driver holds a full UK driving licence or similar certificate of competence
The courses are given by different types of provider – including private companies , the police , and local councils – in different parts of the country , and are provided at the offending driver 's own expense .
In 2012 , The Daily Telegraph reported the cost of attending a speed awareness course to be £100 .
Reception
A comprehensive review undertaken by a team led by Professor Robert Martin of Aston University Business School found that speed awareness courses had a `` long term impact on driver behaviour '' . Martin stated that `` the results clearly show that the speed awareness course led to reliable improvements in client 's attitude to speeding and importantly their intention not to break the speed limit . ''
Impact on insurance premiums
Some insurance companies , including Admiral Insurance , treat drivers who have attended speed awareness courses as if they have been convicted and raise their insurance premiums accordingly . Admiral Insurance stated that their figures show `` people attending a speed awareness course are more likely to make a claim '' . ACPO has responded to this policy of `` loading premiums '' , calling it `` unfair '' and `` inappropriate '' . Other insurers also take a different view . A spokesperson for AA insurance said `` The view of most insurers , including the AA , is that attending a course is a responsible approach and should not be penalised by increasing premiums in the same way as a fixed penalty .

Breislak is a lunar impact crater that lies within one crater diameter north-northwest of the crater Baco , in the southern part of the Moon . To the north-northwest is the crater Barocius , and to the west lies Clairaut . This crater was named in honor of geologist Scipione Breislak .
The rim of Breislak has been heavily worn by subsequent impacts , and several small craterlets lie along the outer wall . One of these craters has cut a notch in the southeast wall , and there are craterlets to the northeast and southwest of this break . A small crater lies on the inner face of the northern wall . The inner surface is roughly level , but pock-marked by several tiny craterlets .
Satellite craters
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Breislak .

Operation Northern Delay occurred on 26 March 2003 as part of the 2003 invasion of Iraq . It involved dropping paratroopers into Northern Iraq . It was the last large-scale combat parachute operation conducted by the U.S. military since Operation Just Cause .
Background
On 26 March 2003 , during the 2003 invasion of Iraq , C-17s of the 62d Airlift Wing , 315th Airlift Wing , 437th Airlift Wing , and 446th Airlift Wing dropped SETAF 's 173rd Airborne Brigade into Northern Iraq . 996 paratroopers jumped into the Bashur drop zone ( ) . The operation forced the Iraqi Army to maintain approximately six divisions in the area to protect its northern flank , providing strategic relief for Coalition Forces advancing on Baghdad from the south . Bashur Airfield is located in northern Iraq approximately 356 kilometers North of Baghdad , 50 kilometers Northeast of Erbil . The airbase is served by a single 6,700 foot long runway . Bashur appeared to be a small civilian airport .
Bashur is the epitome of a bare base . It was nothing more than a 7,000-foot runway in the middle of a green valley . It had no infrastructure - no water or sewage system and no electricity , buildings or paved roads .
Operation
On 26 March 2003 , more than 950 paratroopers from the 173d Airborne Brigade jumped into Bashur , Iraq , to set the stage for a northern front . Two days later , the first soldier from the 501st Forward Support Company , 173d Airborne Brigade , Supply Support Activity ( SSA ) arrived at Bashur Airfield . The operation was classified as a combat jump by the Army , although the landing zone was secured by Kurdish and American forces .
During the next two weeks at Bashur Airfield , all supplies arrived via the airlines of communication ( ALOC ) on C-17s and C-130s from Ramstein Air Base , Germany through Constanta Air Base , Romania . During an average 24-hour day of operations , more than 40 Air Force 463L ALOC pallets would arrive . Each pallet then had to be downloaded from the plane , transported to the SSA , processed and finally issued either to storage or to customers .
Some of the C-17s carried huge M1-A Abrams tanks and weighed from 250,000 to 300,000 pounds when they landed . After two weeks of use by heavy cargo planes , parts of Bashur 's 7,000-foot runway crumbled , forcing the closure of 2,300 feet .
Aftermath
As of April 2003 , Delta Battery 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment remained in Bashur , and continued training New Iraqi Army on key tasks which would be needed in to complete future operations in the region . Delta Battery also provided indirect fire support for coalition forces in the area when coalition forces came into contact with insurgents .
A 20 April 2003 report in The New York Times asserted that `` the U.S. is planning a long-term military relationship with the emerging government of Iraq , one that would grant the Pentagon access to military bases and project American influence into the heart of the unsettled region . '' The report , citing anonymous sources , referred to one base at Baghdad 's international airport , another near Al-Nasiriyah in the south [ presumably meaning Tallil AB ] , the third at the H-1 airstrip in the western desert , and the fourth at Bashur AB in the north .
Bashur Airbase is now known as Harir Airport .

Near the end of the DC vs. Marvel crossover event in 1996 , Amalgam Comics released a series of one-shot comic book issues combining characters from the DC Universe with characters from the Marvel Universe . The first 12 Amalgam titles were released in a single week , temporarily replacing both publishers ' regular releases . Half the comics in the event were published by DC Comics and half by Marvel Comics . In 1997 the event was repeated , but without the crossover event as a background . Later , both publishers collected all of their issues into four trade paperback collections . All 24 of the one-shot issues occurred between Marvel vs. DC # 3 and DC vs. Marvel # 4 , the last two issues of the crossover event .
19 of the 24 Amalgam Comics titles that were printed included letter-columns with letters written by fictitious fans to give a larger background to the stories and to help give hints of what might happen in the next issue . The `` fans '' hometowns were usually fusions of existing American cities .

The Maxwell-Lodge effect is a phenomenon of electromagnetic induction in which an electric charge , near a solenoid in which current changes slowly , feels an electromotive force ( e.m.f . ) even if the magnetic field is practically static inside and null outside . It can be considered a classical analogue of the quantum mechanical Aharonov–Bohm effect , where instead the field is exactly static inside and null outside .
The term appeared in the scientific literature in a 2008 article , referring to an article of 1889 by physicist Oliver Lodge .
Description
Consider an infinite solenoid ( ideal solenoid ) with n turns per length unit , through which a current flows . The magnetic field inside the solenoid is ,
( 1 )
while the field outside the solenoid is null .
From the second and third Maxwell 's equations ,
and from definitions of magnetic potential and electric potential stems :
that without electric charges reduces to
( 2 )
Resuming the original definition of Maxwell on the potential vector , according to which is a vector that its circuitation along a closed curve is equal to the flow of through the surface having the above curve as its edge , i.e .
,
we can calculate the induced e.m.f. , as Lodge did in their 1889 article , considering the closed line around the solenoid , or convenience a circumference , and the surface having as border . Assuming the radius of the solenoid and the radius of , the surface crossing it is subjected to a magnetic flux which is equal to circuitation : . From that stems
.
From ( 2 ) we have that the e.m.f . is null for constant , which means , due to ( 1 ) , at constant current .
On the other hand , if the current changes , must also change , producing electromagnetic waves in the surrounding space that can induce an e.m.f . outside the solenoid .
But if the current changes very slowly , one finds oneself in an almost stationary situation in which the radiative effects are negligible and therefore , excluding , the only possible cause of the e.m.f . is .
It is possible to make calculations without referring to the field . Indeed , in the framework of Maxwell equations as written above :
,
being negligible outside the solenoid . Thus
.
This does n't avoid the problem that is practically null in places where the e.m.f . manifests itself .
Interpretation
Bearing in mind that the concept of field was introduced into physics to ensure that actions on objects are always local , i.e . by contact ( direct and mediated by a field ) and not by remote action , as Albert Einstein feared in the EPR paradox , the result of the Maxwell-Lodge effect , like the Aharonov-Bohom effect , seems contradictory . In fact , even though the magnetic field is zero outside the solenoid and the electromagnetic radiation is negligible , a test charge experiences the presence of an electric field .
The question arises as to how the information on the presence of the magnetic field from inside the solenoid reaches the electric charge . In terms of the fields and the explanation is very simple : the variation of inside the solenoid produces an electric field both inside and outside the solenoid , in the same way in which a charge distribution produces an electric field both inside and outside the distribution . In this sense the information from inside and outside is mediated by the electric field which must be continuous over all space due to the Maxwell equations and their boundary condition .
From the calculations it seems evident that the source can be considered either the variation of the potential vector , if you choose to introduce it , or that of the magnetic field , if you do not want to use the potential vector , which in the classical context has always been considered a mathematical aid , unlike the quantum case , in which Richard Feynman proclaimed its existence as a physical reality .

Its main tributaries are the Shoba ( 93 km ) , Shumba ( 87 km ) , Nolya ( 69 km ) , Ashlanka ( 65 km ) , Pilinka ( 52 km ) , Ashlanka ( 33 km ) , Masarinka ( 87 km ) , and the Ireka ( 63 km ) . The town of Urzhum is located on the left bank of the Urzhumka , about from its mouth .
The source of the Urzhumka is in the woods in the western part of Mari-Tureksky District . The river flows east and in the selo of Bolshoye Oparino turns northeast . The Ireka , a right tributary of the Urzhumka , in the lower course marks the border between Mari El and Kirov Oblast . In Kirov Oblast , the Urzhumka gradually turns north , accepts the Ashlanka from the left , and turns east . In the selo of Shevnino it turns north , passes through the town of Urzhum , and turns east . The mouth of the Urzhumka is downstream of the selo of Tsepochkino .
The river basin of the Urzhumka includes the central part of Mari-Tureksky District , the western part of Urzhumsky District , as well as areas in the east of Paranginsky District of Mari El .

Berney Arms railway station is on the Wherry Lines in the East of England , serving the settlement of Berney Arms on the Halvergate Marshes in Norfolk . It is from and is the only station on a short stretch of single line between and . It is managed by Greater Anglia , which also operates all trains serving the station . The limited number of services timetabled to stop do so on request only .
It is several miles from the nearest road and thus is accessible only by train , on foot , or by boat , as it is a relatively short walk from the River Yare , where private boats can moor . It was adopted in 2010 as part of the Station Adoption Scheme .
History
The Bill for the Yarmouth & Norwich Railway ( Y & NR ) received Royal Assent on 18 June 1842 . Work started on the line in April 1843 and it and its stations were opened on 1 May 1844 . Berney Arms opened with the line and is situated east of and west of ( originally Yarmouth Vauxhall ) . The Y & NR was the first public railway line in Norfolk . A local landowner , Thomas Trench Berney , sold the land on the marshes to the railway company on the condition that Berney Arms station be built . A few years later , the railway stopped serving it , saying that there had been no agreement for trains to actually call at the station that they agreed to build . However , after lengthy legal proceedings , it was agreed to serve the station in perpetuity .
The Y & NR was the first public railway line in Norfolk . On 30 June 1845 a Bill authorising the amalgamation of the Y & NR with the Norwich & Brandon Railway came into effect and Berney Arms station became a Norfolk Railway asset .
The Eastern Counties Railway ( ECR ) and its rival the Eastern Union Railway ( EUR ) were both sizing up the NR to acquire and expand their networks . The ECR trumped the EUR by taking over the NR , including Berney Arms , effective 8 May 1848 .
By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble , and most were leased to the ECR , which wished to amalgamate formally but could not obtain government agreement for this until an Act of Parliament on 7 August 1862 , when the Great Eastern Railway ( GER ) was formed by the consolidation . Actually , Berney Arms had become a GER station on 1 July 1862 when the GER took over the ECR and the EUR before the Bill received its Royal Assent .
The system settled down for the next six decades , apart from the disruption of World War I . The difficult economic circumstances that existed after the war led the government to pass the Railways Act 1921 which led to the creation of the so-called `` Big Four '' companies . The GER amalgamated with several other companies to form the London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) . Berney Arms became an LNER station on 1 January 1923 .
Upon nationalisation in 1948 the station and its services became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways .
The post office at Berney Arms Station , which had opened in 1898 , was closed in 1967 .
On privatisation the station and its services were transferred to Anglia Railways , which operated it until 2004 , when National Express East Anglia won the replacement franchise , operating under the brand name 'one ' until 2008 . In 2012 Abellio Greater Anglia took over operating the franchise .
The former Berney Arms signal box is preserved at Mangapps Railway Museum in Burnham-on-Crouch , Essex .
Least-used station
On 1 December 2020 , Berney Arms was announced as the least used station in Great Britain for the 2019/20 period ( between April 2019 and March 2020 ) , with only 42 people using the station . The low numbers were largely due to the station being closed for major signalling works along the line for much of the 2019/20 period , but were also caused by the local pub being closed down . This is also one of the main reasons that passenger numbers had been falling dramatically since the 2016/17 period .
However , the station was used by 348 passengers in the year to March 2021 ; the greatest yearly rise for any station in the UK .
Locality
The station is located around from the River Yare in an area of exposed grazing marsh . The surrounding marshland is managed as the RSPB Berney Marshes reserve and is adjacent to Breydon Water , a major site for wildfowl . Berney Arms Windmill , owned by English Heritage , is located on the Yare near to the station , as is the Berney Arms public house ( currently closed ) .
The Weavers ' Way and Wherryman 's Way long-distance footpaths both pass near the station .
Services
The line is on part of the Wherry Lines currently operated by Greater Anglia . Services are formed by Class 755/3s .
The station is a stop for two trains per day to Norwich and two to Great Yarmouth ; the service is increased on Sundays to four trains in each direction . Service frequencies generally increase slightly during the summer period , to three trains in each direction per day and five in each direction at the weekend .
During the winter months up until the end of March , the last train from Great Yarmouth to Norwich does not stop at Berney Arms . This is because of the lack of light at the station and its surrounding area . After the clocks go forward , the last trains are timetabled to stop again ( 17:54 Mondays to Saturdays , 16:24 Sundays ) .
In October 2018 the line between Great Yarmouth and Reedham was closed for a major upgrade of the signalling system , as part of works on all the Wherry Lines . While the line was closed the station remained open , although no replacement service was available due to the remote location . Its reopening was delayed until February 2020 , with the station reopening on 24 February 2020 .

Christ 's College , Aberdeen was one of three colleges in Scotland founded by the Free Church of Scotland for the training of ministers following the Disruption of 1843 . The other two were New College , Edinburgh and Trinity College , Glasgow .
Following the Church reunion of 1929 , Christ 's College became a Church of Scotland college and was also integrated into the University of Aberdeen . It now is based within the University 's King 's College campus in Old Aberdeen . The College 's former buildings in the west end of Aberdeen are no longer used by the church or university .
The post of Master of Christ 's College is still a Church of Scotland appointment , but for most purposes it is closely connected with the University of Aberdeen 's School of Divinity , History and Philosophy . The current Master is the Rev . Professor John Swinton ; who followed on from Rev Ian Dick Minister at Ferryhill Parish Church and the first full time Parish Minister to be appointed Master .
The principal role of Christ 's College is to oversee the preparation and formation of ministerial candidates for the Church of Scotland . From its offices in the University of Aberdeen , the College collaborates closely with the divinity faculty to ensure candidates receive appropriate academic training for the ministry , funding a lectureship in Practical Theology , organizing extramural lectures and seminars , and hosting an annual lecture at the beginning of each academic year . In addition , the College maintains the Divinity Library , which serves all undergraduates within the department . It also contributes to the spiritual life of the university , organising a weekly Chapter Service during each academic term . The College administers the Lumsden and Sachs Fellowship , awarded to the University of Aberdeen 's most outstanding graduating student in Divinity and Religious Studies .

Metro is a high-performance , extensible , easy-to-use web service stack . Although historically an open-source part of the GlassFish application server , it can also be used in a stand-alone configuration . Components of Metro include : JAXB RI , JAX-WS RI , SAAJ RI , StAX ( SJSXP implementation ) and WSIT . Originally available under the CDDL and GPLv2 with classpath exception , it is now available under
History
Originally , the Glassfish project developed two semi-independent projects :
JAX-WS RI , the Reference implementation of the JAX-WS specification
WSIT , a Java implementation of some of the WS- * and an enhanced support for interoperability with the .NET Framework . It is based on JAX-WS RI as `` Web Service layer '' .
In June 2007 , it was decided to bundle these two components as a single component named Metro .
Features
Metro compares well with other web service frameworks in terms of functionality . Codehaus started a comparison which compared Apache Axis 1.x , Axis 2.x , Celtix , Glue , JBossWS , Xfire 1.2 and JAX-WS RI + WSIT ( the bundle was not yet named Metro at that time ) . This was later updated by the ASF to replace Celtix with CXF and to include OracleAS 10g .
Metro includes JAXB RI , JAX-WS RI , SAAJ RI , SJSXP , and WSIT , along with libraries that those components depend on , such as xmlstreambuffer , mimepull , etc .
Its features include :
Basic Profile 1.1 Compliant
Easily Create Services from POJOs
RPC-Encoding
Spring Support
REST Support
Soap 1.1/1.2
Streaming XML ( StAX based )
WSDL 1.1 - > Code ( Client ) / ( Server )
Server and Client-side Asynchrony
Supported WS- * Standards
Supported Transport protocols include :
HTTP
JMS
SMTP/POP3
TCP
In-VM
Metro augments the JAX-WS environment with advanced features such as trusted , end-to-end security ; optimized transport ( MTOM , Fast Infoset ) , reliable messaging , and transactional behavior for SOAP web services .
Market share
Metro is bundled with Java SE 6 in order to allow consumers of Java SE 6 to consume Web Services .
Metro is bundled with numerous application servers such as :
GlassFish
Sun Java System Application Server Platform Edition 9.x
Oracle WebLogic Server
JBoss ( version 5.x only )
TmaxSoft JEUS 6.x
The JAXB reference implementation developed for Metro is used in virtually every Java Web Services framework ( Apache Axis2 , Codehaus XFire , Apache CXF ) and Application Servers .

In the United States , Black Identity Extremists ( BIE ) was a designation used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) from August 2017 to July 2019 . It first appeared in a counterterrorism report dated August 3 , 2017 sent to thousands of American police departments and described safety concerns about allegedly violent African-American activists . The term was discontinued when the FBI merged several classifications under the umbrella term of “ racially motivated violent extremism ” .
Definition
According to documents obtained by The Young Turks a 2018-19 `` Threat Guidance '' defined Black Identity Extremists as people who `` use force or violence in violation of criminal law in response to perceived racism and injustice in society '' . The FBI files also claim that one of the motives was `` establishing a separate black homeland or autonomous black social institutions , communities or governing organizations within the USA . ''
Reactions
The term first received media attention in October 2017 when Foreign Policy published a leaked copy of the report in October 2017 . According to Foreign Policy , the report is the first reference to `` black identity extremists '' , while also noting the report claims `` [ t ] he FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated , retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence '' . However , former government officials and legal experts claimed the term described a movement that did not exist .
Civil liberties organizations and political commentators expressed concern that the internal use of this designation by the FBI 's counter-terrorism unit signals a politically-motivated effort to falsely equivocate black activism , such as the Black Lives Matter movement , with white supremacists .
In November 2017 , the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives , the nation 's largest black police group , stated that the FBI designation was `` ill advised . ''
In December 2017 , Rakem Balogun was arrested after they were designated as a `` Black Identity Extremist '' . However , by May 2018 all charges against them had been dropped .
In March 2018 , the term was discussed during a sitting of the Congressional Black Caucus .
According to the ACLU , documents leaked by the The Young Turks show that a program called IRON FIST continued to investigate Black activists , even though the label `` Black Identity Extremist '' was no longer used . The label was retired after objections that it inappropriately assigned a group or organizational identity without sufficient evidence to show that such a group actually existed . It has not dismantled other surveillance programs like IRON FIST , leading to criticism that the Federal government has neglected the threat posed by white supremacists to focus on targeting Black people .

The Cuban grassquit ( Phonipara canora ) is a small bird in the tanager family Thraupidae . It is endemic to Cuba .
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest , subtropical or tropical moist montane forest , subtropical or tropical dry shrubland , and heavily degraded former forest .
Taxonomy
The Cuban grassquit was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin under the binomial name Loxia canora . They based their description on the `` Brown Cheeked Grosbeak '' that had been described by Peter Brown in 1776 . Brown 's illustration was from a live bird belonging to Marmaduke Tunstall which Brown mistakenly believed had come from Mexico . It only occurs in Cuba . This species was formerly placed in the genus Tiaris , but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that Tiaris was polyphyletic . In the resulting reorganization , the Cuban grassquit was moved to the resurrected genus Phonipara that had been introduced in 1850 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte . The genus name combines the Ancient Greek phōnēs meaning `` vocal '' with the Latin parus meaning `` tit '' . The specific epithet conora is from Latin canorus meaning `` melodious '' . The Cuban grassquit is monotypic : no subspecies are recognised .
Although traditionally placed with the buntings and New World sparrows in the family Emberizidae , molecular genetic studies have shown that the Cuban grassquit is a member of the subfamily Coerebinae within the tanager family Thraupidae .

Daniel Kanell ( born November 21 , 1973 ) is a former professional American football quarterback in the National Football League ( NFL ) and Arena Football League , and former ESPN personality . They were employed by ESPN as an analyst and host on the Russillo and Kanell show on ESPN Radio . They were the host of ESPNU 's late-night sports and humor show UNITE before the show was canceled in June 2013 .
They would also appear on ESPN 's new College Football Playoff Selection Show alongside Rece Davis , Joey Galloway , and Kirk Herbstreit . Their career with ESPN ended on April 26 , 2017 . They are currently employed by CBS Sports , along with Fox Sports 1 and SiriusXM .
College career
They attended Florida State University , where they played quarterback for four years . In 1992 , as a first-year student , Kanell won the job of backing up starter Charlie Ward , the team 's first first-year student backup since Chip Ferguson in 1985 . After doing well in occasional backup play , they won the job again as a sophomore in 1993 , despite increased competition . The team later moved to alternating between Kanell and fellow sophomore Jon Stark as backups , though Kanell was given the start when Florida State held out Ward against Maryland due to bruised ribs and Kanell responded by completing 28 of 38 passes for 341 yards , five touchdowns , and no interceptions . Overall that year , they threw for 499 yards with 7 TD vs. 0 INT while backing up Ward , who won the Heisman Trophy , Davey O'Brien , Maxwell , and Walter Camp Awards that year .
In their junior year , they threw for 2,781 yards with 17 TD vs 13 INT on 380 pass attempts . They were a part of the famous Choke at Doak game against Florida , where they led Florida State back from a 31-3 fourth quarter deficit to tie the game . They then beat Florida in the rematch at the Sugar Bowl dubbed the `` Fifth Quarter in the French Quarter '' , finishing the year with a 10–1–1 record .
In their senior year ( 1995 ) , they threw for 2,957 yards with 32 TD vs 13 INT on 402 pass attempts . They led the team to a 10–2 record , including a win over Notre Dame in the 1996 Orange Bowl . They were given an `` honorable mention '' in the All-American list of their senior year . They were also the starting quarterback for Florida State 's first loss to an ACC opponent , as the Virginia Cavaliers defeated Florida State 33-28 on November 2 , 1995 . While throwing for more than 450 yards during the game , Kanell also threw 3 interceptions and completed less than 50 % of their passes . One of those interceptions was thrown at the Virginia 2-yard line late in the first half .
During their career at the university they played in 35 games and completed 62.2 % of their 851 pass attempts . They threw for 6,372 yards , 57 touchdowns ( at the time a school record ) and 26 interceptions over their four years as a Seminole . They also ran for one touchdown and managed to catch one pass for a loss of three yards . In September 2012 Kanell was inducted into the Florida State Athletic Hall of Fame .
Kanell also played baseball during their first-year student and sophomore years , playing in seven games over the two seasons . They were drafted in the 25th round by the New York Yankees in the 1993 Major League Baseball Draft .
Professional career
Kanell was drafted by the New York Giants in the fourth round ( 135th overall ) in the 1996 NFL Draft . They made their NFL debut later that season . The next season in New York , Kanell became the starter and played the last ten games of the 1997 season , leading the Giants to the NFC Eastern Division title . In those ten games they threw for 1,740 yards with eleven touchdowns and nine interceptions . The Giants played in the playoffs against the Minnesota Vikings but lost 23–22 . Kanell went 13/32 with 199 yards and one touchdown in that game . The following year , Kanell started all ten games they played in while throwing for 1,303 yards , eleven touchdowns and ten interceptions . With a record of 3–7 at that point , the Giants benched Kanell in favor of Kent Graham , who led the Giants to a 5–1 record down the stretch and an 8–8 finish . At the end of the season the Giants signed Kerry Collins from the New Orleans Saints and cut Kanell to make enough salary cap room to pay Collins ' salary .
In the off season Kanell found a home with the Atlanta Falcons as a backup to their oft injured starting quarterback Chris Chandler . They played in Atlanta for two years , starting two games and playing in eight . As a Falcon they completed 99 of 200 attempted passes for a total of 1,117 yards , six touchdowns and nine interceptions . At the end of the 2000 season they were cut by the Falcons and did not sign with another team .
A year later , Kanell signed with the New York Dragons of the Arena Football League for the 2002 season , appearing in four games in Aaron Garcia 's absence . Following that , they were signed during training camp by the Denver Broncos . They made the roster as the third-string quarterback in Denver but was let go shortly through the season . Seven games into the season , starting quarterback Jake Plummer and backup quarterback Steve Beuerlein suffered foot and hand injuries , respectively . Kanell was recalled to the Broncos and started two games until Beuerlein and Plummer returned . They threw two touchdowns and five interceptions on 103 pass attempts . Kanell remained with the Broncos for one more year as the backup to Plummer . They never played , as Plummer became the first Broncos quarterback in franchise history to take every offensive snap . After the 2004 season , they were cut by the Broncos and was not picked up by another NFL team .
Baseball career
Kanell was drafted out of high school by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 19th round , and after their junior year at Florida State by the New York Yankees in the 25th round . However , they saw football as more important and signed with the New York Giants when they were drafted in 1996 .
During a layoff from football in 2001 , Kanell returned to baseball , playing in the minor leagues for the Atlantic League 's Newark Bears . They played at first base , third base and designated hitter , hitting for a .237 average with one home run in 79 plate appearances for the Bears . Kanell said they wanted to eventually play for the Yankees , as they had grown up idolizing Yankees first baseman Don Mattingly .
Broadcasting career
Kanell was employed at ESPN , during which they hosted ESPNU 's , UNITE and served as color analyst for Friday Night college football games and college baseball . Kanell made several guest appearances on ESPN Radio 's SVP ( Scott Van Pelt ) & Russillo . It was announced that they would co-host The Russillo Show full-time after frequent guest appearances . Starting in September 2015 , Kanell took on their role as co-host to the new show Russillo and Kanell . On April 26 , 2017 , Kanell was among approximately 100 staffers let go by ESPN in a cost-cutting measure . On August 28 , 2017 , Kanell joined Fox Sports 1 as a college football analyst , and became the host of their own radio show on SiriusXM . In 2018 , they began hosting ‘ Dog Day Sports ' with Steve Torre on Mad Dog Sports Radio , SiriusXM channel 82 .

Early life
Prather was born and raised in Jackson , Tennessee , under the stern watch of their mother Enova and sister Brittany , with their parents having split before they were born . Growing up , family and basketball kept them away from the growing criminal element in their community . At the age of 12 , their stepfather , Jeffery , noticed Prather 's athleticism and began teaching them the skills required to pursue playing professionally .
High school career
Prather attended Jackson 's North Side High School , where they averaged 28 points per game as a sophomore , and 24.4 points and 14 rebounds as a junior . During their junior season , they had a 53-point , 24-rebound performance in a district game against Fayette Ware High School . Following their junior year , they were ranked the 25th best prospect by Scout.com , and the 10th best small forward . On November 17 , 2009 , they signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for the University of Florida .
As a senior in 2009–10 , Prather was a finalist for Tennessee 's Mr. Basketball after averaging 29 points , 13 rebounds , five blocks , five steals and three assists per game . They finished their four-year career at North Side with over 2,000 points . They were selected to the All-District team and was named team MVP all four seasons at North Side , and was selected to the district 's All-Tournament team their sophomore , junior and senior seasons . They were also named All-West Player of the Year in 2008–09 and 2009–10 .
During their time at North Side , Prather was member of the Nashville Celtics AAU team that captured the 2010 River City Showdown Championship .
College career
Prather played four seasons of college basketball for Billy Donovan 's Florida Gators . Over their first three college seasons , Prather was a key role player off the bench . As a junior in 2012–13 , Prather played in 29 games with two starting assignments , and averaged a career-best 6.2 points per game . They led the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) with a .642 two-point field goal percentage . They twice scored a season-high 12 points , and had an 11-point game in Florida 's Sweet 16 win over Florida Gulf Coast .
As a senior year in 2013–14 , Prather stepped up to become a key scorer for the Gators , more than doubling their scoring average from their junior year . They led the Gators in scoring and was named first-team All-SEC . They became the third Gator under Billy Donovan to record three 27-point games in a single season , joining Nick Calathes ( 2008–09 ) and Teddy Dupay ( 2000–01 ) . They totaled six 20-point games , including their career-best 28 points in Florida 's season opener against North Florida . This increase in production was a key factor for Florida becoming one of the top teams of the 2013–14 season . For the fourth straight year , the Gators reached the Regional Finals , where they defeated Dayton to move on to the Final Four . In the National semi-finals , the Gators were defeated by Connecticut to fall short of reaching the Championship Game , despite a 15-point effort from Prather . In 37 games ( 35 starts ) for the Gators in 2013–14 , they averaged 13.8 points , 5.0 rebounds , 1.6 assists and 1.0 steals per game .

Spirituals is the fourth studio album by American musician and singer Santigold . It was released digitally and physically on vinyl on 9 September 2022 through Little Jerk Records . The CD was out on September , 30 .
The lyrics address human resilience . Santigold promoted Spirituals with singles and videos for `` High Priestess '' , `` Ai n't Ready '' , `` Nothing '' , `` Shake '' and `` Fall First '' .
The album received favorable reviews .
Background
Santigold had released the Do n't Want : The Gold Fire Sessions mixtape in July 2018 and they had additionally appeared on two Tyler , the Creator releases , Music Inspired by Illumination & Dr. Seuss ' The Grinch in late 2018 and Igor in mid 2019 , contributing vocals . Spirituals was recorded largely throughout the COVID-19 pandemic , between 2020 and 2021 with lyrics inspired in part by the present time in the US . The album was an nod to the traditional Negro spirituals .
They stated : `` I called it `` Spirituals '' because , for me , making this record was my own salvation , really . It was an opportunity to step out of survival mode . And the idea of using art and music in particular to transcend my circumstances and experience freedom and joy and beauty in the absence of it in my environment to me was the same thing that Negro spirituals did for slaves in a time where they were able to experience freedom and joy through this music when their - in their environments , they were not free , and there was n't - it was n't joyous . ''
Santigold explained that the writing process was cathartic . It was `` creating light for me to move towards '' ; `` I 'm so lucky to know that creating , just the act of creating , can do that for me , can save me that way , can lift me up . '' They described Spirituals as a `` celebration of human resilience . ''
In mid-April 2021 , Santigold shared a picture of their final days in the studio to social media . In June 2021 , Santigold featured on Mark Ronson 's The Fader Uncovered podcast . They confirmed details of their upcoming album , which was being mixed at the time , sharing the title and stating :
Music
Spiritual incorporates pop beats , electronica , tropicalia , gospel , punk , rap , funk , post-punk , and reggae .
Rolling Stone wrote that on Spirituals opener `` My Horror '' , `` she combines subtle electronica with flashes of ukulele '' . `` High Priestess '' was described as s a `` powerful slice of glitchy rap pop , pitted against fierce lyrical wordplay '' . Heather Phares described it as `` a deceptively sweet lullaby of stasis that unleashes its dread slowly '' . Alternative Press wrote about the songs : `` She shares their journey to ascension and invites us to participate with tropical rhythms that simultaneously haunt and uplift '' . NME wrote that Santigold opened to love on the closing track `` Fall First '' , saying : `` her passion is channelled through an unlikely vintage post-punk lens , complete with a motorik beat , an ominous bassline and cavernous reverb '' .
Release
The album was released worldwide on CD and picture disc vinyl LP , via various retailers including Amazon , `` Roughtrade '' , Juno , `` Imusic '' , and Fnac .
Short music videos were shot and uploaded on Santigold 's YouTube channel for the five singles taken from the album : `` High Priestess '' , `` Ai n't Ready '' , `` Nothing '' , `` Shake '' and `` Fall First '' .
The lead single , `` High Priestess '' , was released in May 2022 , later followed by `` Ai n't Ready '' , alongside the album 's announcement , and `` Nothing '' . Spirituals was released via Little Jerk Records label .
Critical reception
Spirituals was met with mostly positive reviews . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 78 , based on 14 reviews .
NME rated it 4 out of 5 stars , saying that `` fearless sonic pioneer leads the pack once again '' , and The Telegraph published a glowing review , praising the diversity of the styles , rating it 8 out of 10 . The Guardian rated it 4 out of 5 stars , sayining it was `` a heartfelt lockdown journey through loneliness , triumph and rage '' . Pitchfork reviewer Heven Haile considered that Santigold `` is pioneering an innovative soundscape '' on Spirituals with `` unsettlingly ethereal vocals '' , concluding that they `` reimagines the type of music that can comfort people in times of grief and stagnation '' . Another writer of the NME praised in particular the song `` Fall First '' , saying : `` Santi 's signature yelp fits like a glove over this sonic mixture '' . Heather Phares of AllMusic noted in general `` hypnotic '' songs `` with ear-catching production choices aplenty '' and how `` Santigold also excels at bridging the past , present , and future of their own music '' . Reviewer Robert Christgau hailed Spirituals as Santigold 's best album yet , crediting them with `` transmuting the atmospheric midtempo rock-as-electrodance she 's long fiddled with so engagingly into something more ominous , almost as if she 's observant enough to notice that she 's living in history '' .

Egidius Benedictus Watermeyer ( 21 August 1824 - 21 September 1867 ) , informally known simply as `` Ben '' , was a Judge and a founding Member of the Cape Legislative Assembly .
Early life
Ben Watermeyer was born into a Cape family of German ancestry ( his grandfather was originally from Hamburg ) . They were the second son of Frederick Stephanus Watermeyer Snr ( 1797-1847 ) , and Anna Maria Ziervogel .
They were a quiet and studious child , who even as a small child was able to correspond with their older brother in Classical Greek . They read law , went to study Civil Law in the Netherlands in 1841 , and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in London in 1847 .
In the same year in 1847 , they returned to the Cape Colony and was admitted as an Advocate at the Supreme Court . An un-ostentatious but extremely hard-working man , Watermeyer partook in most of the important cases in the late 1840s and gained an extremely detailed knowledge of southern Africa by working the circuit courts .
They married Johanna Catharina Henrietta Reitz ( niece of Frederick William Reitz Snr . ) The marriage was childless but exceptionally happy .
Member of Parliament ( 1854-5 )
When the Cape attained its first Parliament in 1854 , several Districts requested them to stand as an MP , and they agreed eventually to stand for the District which had asked first - Worcester . They missed the first session ( being on circuit ) but immediately on taking their seat , they joined the liberal anti-government party of Saul Solomon , William Porter , John Molteno and John Fairbairn ( whom they greatly admired ) . With several of these colleagues , they helped frame the Standing Rules and Orders of the house . They were one of the Members of Parliament who supported the first ( unsuccessful ) attempt to institute `` responsible government '' in 1855 .
Though they only served for one year , until 1855 , they were enormously influential . In spite of their mild speech impediment , their speeches were enormously respected and , without exception , carried the house on the debate at hand . An introverted man , they were chiefly noted for their broad-minded , inclusive approach to politics .
They retired from politics in 1855 , though two of their relatives were to serve in the house shortly afterwards : Frederick Stephanus Watermeyer and Philip Johannes Andries Watermeyer .
Later life
Even in their early career , they typically pursued several concurrent lines of work and study . Their interest in the language , culture and history of the early Khoi people was especially strong . It was in law however , that they were chiefly known .
They were subsequently appointed a Judge .
They established and chaired the Board of Examiners that went on to provide the basis for the University of the Cape of Good Hope that was founded in 1874 . They produced a huge amount of writings in their short life .
Ben Watermeyer died young and grief-stricken in 1867 , aged only 43 . They had been greatly affected by the death of their brother Frank in 1864 , and then the death of their wife the very next year in 1865 .
The Dictionary of National Biography devotes a paragraph to laud their modest kindness , empathy , reasoning powers and their vast reserve of patience . These qualities , together with their gentle sense of humour , made them one of the most loved of the Cape 's public figures at the time .

MV Discovery Sun was the flagship and sole ship of Discovery Cruise Lines , a Miami-based tour operator . They were built at the Orenstein & Koppel shipyard in Lübeck , Germany in 1968 and was renovated in 1995 and then updated in 2000 .

One crew member and one passenger were killed , and 57 passengers and crew were injured .
Fate
In September 2011 , Discovery Cruise Lines ceased operations , citing high operating costs and lack of profitability . Discovery Sun was subsequently offered for sale , but there was no buyer or charterer . Discovery Sun was broken up for scrap at Chittagong on 13 February 2012 .

The Deutschfreiheitliche Partei ( in English , German Freedom Party , in Italian Partito Libertario Tedesco ) was a political party active in Tyrol at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century . It had a Liberal national orientation .
It originated in 1880 from a section of the German Liberal Party , which was active across Austria . This new party , however , was only active in the County of Tyrol . Among the major leasers of the party were Julius Perathoner , burgomaster of Bolzano from 1895 to 1922 .
Active in Alto Adige after its annexation to Italy after World War I , the part ran in the 1921 election in a coalition with the Tiroler Volkspartei called the Deutscher Verband which won 90 % of the German-speaking vote and elected four members to the Camera dei deputati - Eduard Reut-Nicolussi , Karl Tinzl , Friedrich von Toggenburg and Wilhelm von Walther .
In Austrian Tyrol , the party joined with the Großdeutsche Volkspartei in 1920/1921 .

Notes
National security directives are generally highly classified and are not executive orders . However , in an unprecedented move , the Trump administration ordered their national security directives to be published in the Federal Register .
National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directives address continuity of government in the event of a `` catastrophic emergency '' disrupting the U.S. population , economy , environment , infrastructure and government policy .
On April 25 , 2017 , United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California William Orrick III ruled that Trump exceeded their presidential authority when they signed EO 13768 on January 25 , 2017 , directing their administration to withhold all federal funding from local jurisdictions deemed to be `` sanctuary jurisdictions '' including `` sanctuary cities '' by issuing a preliminary injunction . Judge Orrick subsequently issued a nationwide permanent injunction on November 20 , 2017 , declaring that section 9 ( a ) of Executive Order 13768 was `` unconstitutional on its face '' and violates `` the separation of powers doctrine and deprives [ the plaintiffs ] of their Tenth and Fifth Amendment rights . ''
Revoked by : EO 13780 , of March 16 , 2017 .
Revokes : EO 13769 , of March 16 , 2017 .
On March 15 , 2017 , Judge Derrick Watson of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the government from enforcing several key provisions of the order ( Sections 2 and 6 ) . The judge claimed the executive order was likely motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment and thus breached the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution . On the same date , Judge Theodore Chuang of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland reached a similar conclusion ( enjoining Section 2 ( c ) only ) . The Department of Justice stated that it `` will continue to defend [ the ] Executive Order in the courts '' . Shortly following arguments from the state of Hawaii and the Department of Justice , the restraining order was converted by Watson into an indefinite preliminary injunction on March 29 .
United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond , Virginia , refused on May 25 , 2017 , to reinstate the ban , citing religious discrimination . On June 1 , 2017 , the Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for the cancellation of the preliminary injunctions and to allow the order to go into effect while the court looks at its ultimate legality later in the year . On June 26 , 2017 , the Supreme Court partially lifted the halt and will hear oral arguments for the petition to vacate the injunctions in the fall .
Revokes : EO 13673 of July 31 , 2014 , section 3 of EO 13683 of December 11 , 2014 , and EO 13738 of August 23 , 2016 .

On November 20 , 2017 , Orrick permanently blocked EO 13768 ( Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States ) . With lawsuits brought by San Francisco and Santa Clara counties , Orrick ruled that the Trump administration ca n't set new conditions on spending approved by Congress . Orrick found the order unconstitutional . In the judge 's decision , the Trump administration 's efforts to move local officials to cooperate with its efforts to deport undocumented immigrants violated the separation of powers doctrine as well as the Fifth and Tenth amendments . Orrick said that the order was written broadly to `` reach all federal grants '' and potentially jeopardized hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to San Francisco and Santa Clara .

Code Name : Wild Geese ( , ) is a 1984 West German-Italian Euro War film directed by Antonio Margheriti and starring Lewis Collins in the first of their three mercenary war films . Despite the films title , Code Name : Wild Geese is not the sequel to The Wild Geese film , but a derivative film . Kim Newman described the film as closer to the director 's films such as The Last Hunter and Cannibal Apocalypse .
Plot
In Hong Kong , DEA man Fletcher ( Borgnine ) heads an operation to cut off the supply of opium to the west ; to fund this operation Fletcher has found themselves allied with wealthy American business person Brenner .
Brenner and their partner , ex-mercenary Charlton , employ Robin Wesley , a father who 's still grieving over their dead heroin addict son , to destroy opium factories in the Golden Triangle . Wesley 's team consists of other mercenaries from around the world , some of whom have been on the wrong side of the law ( China and Klein ) .
As the team enters the Golden Triangle by boat , Fletcher , Brenner and Charlton remain in Hong Kong , waiting on every piece of news transmitted from their base . After travelling a distance down river , the team disembark for a march through the jungle , where they meet up with Kim and their guerrilla fighters . Kim and their men guide Wesley 's team through the jungle to a remote base located in a quarry . One of Kim 's men and Klein each eliminate a sentry in a watch tower . As Wesley , China , Klein , Stone and Kim and their men prepare to descend the steep incline into the quarry , Arbib and Kowalski rig a rope slide across the top of the quarry . First Kowalski slides over the communications hut before dropping through the bamboo roof , killing one soldier and capturing the other , even though he 's been impaled through their upper left arm by a foot long piece of bamboo . Then Arbib drops into the sleeping quarters hut , where he 's forced to kill all the occupants , who are awakened and try to attack him . The rest of the commandos descend the steep quarry sides and shoot any enemy that escape from Kowalski and Arbib , except for China , who secures the base 's lone helicopter and readies it for flight . With the base secured , Kim removes the bamboo splinter from Kowalski 's arm and bandages it while Wesley uses the base 's radio to inform their own base that they have captured the helicopter intact . Leaving Kowalski with two of Kim 's men to guard the base and its radio , the rest join China aboard the helicopter , which takes off and heads deeper into the triangle .
While Brenner and Charlton are enjoying a round of golf , Fletcher interrupts them to let them know that Wesley has neutralized the quarry base and captured the helicopter . As China pilots the helicopter towards the opium manufacturing depot , the depot radios the quarry to see if the radar contact they have is the quarry 's helicopter . The lone survivor at the quarry , under the watchful eye and gun of Kowalski , confirms that it is and is just on a routine trip . Satisfied , the depot allows the helicopter to land and the commandos come out shooting , killing all the enemy soldiers who stray into their sight . As Wesley , Arbib and Stone destroy the heroin laboratories with C4 , Klein blows up the opium container silos with grenades and C4 . While the destruction is going on , Stone is unfortunately wounded and Klein and China race to help him ; Kim and their men locate prisoners and free them . All return to their homes except for a North American woman who behaves in a bizarre manner . China intervenes when they misjudge Kim to be attacking the woman , only for Arbib to point out that the woman is a heroin addict with puncture marks on their forearm . Wesley enters an office and rifles through a safe ; finding a computer disk , they load it on a nearby computer and browses its contents .

We Live on Cliffs is the debut studio album by singer/songwriter Adam Stephens , vocalist and guitar player for San Francisco , California 's folk rock guitar/drum duo Two Gallants . We Live on Cliffs was released on September 28 , 2010 , on Saddle Creek Records . The album is credited to `` Adam Haworth Stephens '' and was produced by Joe Chiccarelli .
Background
Two Gallants had been touring almost non-stop for six years , since forming in 2002 until taking a hiatus starting in the summer of 2008 . During that time the duo also recorded and released three full-length albums as well as an album-length EP . The stress of touring with seemingly non-stop van breakdowns , recording sessions , and countless interviews tired the band out both mentally and physically . Stephens and fellow band member Tyson Vogel each decided to focus on other work , with Stephens pursuing a solo album and Vogel collaborating with some string players on an instrumental project called Devotionals .
Critical reception
We Live on Cliffs received mixed reviews from critics . Jessie Cataldo of Slant criticized the album as being formulaic , stating , `` The focus here is crystalline , immaculately styled country—slow , pretty songs fleshed out by female backing vocals . At worst , it 's an album full of half-cocked Ryan Adams impressions , digging into an antiseptic style that sounds cheesy even when Adams attempts it . '' Cataldo as well as Alex Henderson of AllMusic and a review at Sputnikmusic all discussion the album as attempting to sound Dylan-esque , and failing to live up to such a high standard for Americana music . Despite the criticism , Cataldo and Henderson did make note of Stephens ' potential as a songwriter and solo artist .

John Mahan , ( January 26 , 1851 – 1895 ? ) was a 19th-century Irish-born American bare-knuckle boxer and pugilist . They were a noted heavyweight fighter in the Northeastern United States during the 1870s and billed as having `` an unbeaten record '' until their prizefight with future heavyweight champion John L. Sullivan in 1881 . Sullivan rose to national prominence as a result of their victory while Mahan went into semi-retirement , taking part in numerous exhibition bouts during the 1880s . Mahan later toured the U.S. with Sullivan and became one of their chief sparring partners .
One-time coroner of Jersey City , New Jersey , they were also involved in New York City politics with Boss Tweed during their boxing career and later involved in the Tweed Ring .
Biography
Early life and boxing career
John Mahan was born in Kells , County Meath , Ireland on January 26 , 1851 . Later emigrating to the United States , they became coroner of Jersey City , New Jersey . They were also active in New York City machine politics and , aligning themselves Tammany Hall and Boss Tweed , became involved in what would later be referred to as the Tweed Ring .
Like many politicians of the era , Mahan began taking part in professional boxing . Under the ring name Steve Taylor , they eventually established themselves as a formidable bare-knuckle boxer and pugilist in the Northeastern United States . They were described as `` a six footer , of very powerful build , and as agile as a cat '' . One of their first major fights was against Billy Edwards at the Brooklyn Rink in Brooklyn , New York on June 5 , 1876 , which they lost after 17 rounds , and scored an 18-round victory over Charles McDonald later that year .
On November 17 , their bout against Brooklyn champion John J. Dwyer at the Lyceum Theatre was interrupted by the New York City Police Department who stopped the fight and the match was declared a draw . A rematch was fought between the two in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania on March 23 , 1877 , this time with both wearing boxing gloves , in which they lost . Despite this , they earned a reputation as a `` game and scientific boxer '' from their matches with Dwyer and was referred to by some newspapers as `` the ex-heavyweight champion of America '' . It was reported that they were `` almost the only American who could any stand '' against Jem Mace when the boxing champion arrived in the U.S. and the two sparred with each other throughout the country .
They often frequented Harry Hill 's bar , a hugely popular sportsman resort and the center of New York 's sporting culture during the late 19th century . They became a sparring partner for then bare knuckle champion Joe Goss and later helped train Paddy Ryan who would defeat Goss for the title in 1880 .
Bout with John L. Sullivan
On March 31 , 1881 , at a testimonial benefit in Harry Hill 's resort , an offer was made by New York sportsmen in attendance to give $ 50 to any man who , using Marquis of Queensbury rules , could last four rounds with John L. Sullivan . This was in reference to the more widely known challenge with Sullivan had posted to Paddy Ryan . Taylor , Ryan 's former trainer , accepted in this first-ever impromptu boxing match . Refereed by Matt Grace , a well-known collar and elbow wrestler , while Dick Hollywood and Billy Madden were the cornermen for Mahan and Sullivan respectively . Mahan was knocked out by Sullivan `` after a few hard licks '' in the second round and , in a gesture of good sportsmanship , offered half the prize to their opponent . After the bout , Mahan said `` Taylor [ Mahan ] takes their hat off only to Sully '' . The event received much attention from the press , this being the young Sullivan 's New York debut , and was especially covered by the Police Gazette , the New York Clipper and the New York Herald .
Semi-retirement and touring with Sullivan
Mahan went into semi-retirement following their match with Sullivan taking part in a few exhibition matches during the next several years . On March 19 , 1883 , Taylor was one of three opponents Sullivan faced at a benefit at the Mechanics Institute in Boston which earned over $ 15,000 . The event was said to have been `` the largest and most noteworthy sparring exposition ever given in New England '' . They later toured the country with Sullivan , Herbert Slade , Pete McCoy and Mike Gillespie . One of these was against Gillespie at an opera house in McKeesport , Pennsylvania on October 19 of that year . This specific bout was considered a comical exhibition bout , Mahan outweighing the lightweight boxer by at least 40 pounds , and went to three rounds before both men retired . During the match , one man supposedly yelled out to Gillespie that they `` either stand on a chair or put their glove on a broomstick '' .
After holding a two-day exhibition bout at the People 's Theater in St. Louis , Missouri from November 5–6 , Mahan and Sullivan were arrested by authorities while they and the others were preparing to leave the following morning . The two were charged with violating a state law prohibiting public sparring and boxing exhibitions but , after posting bail , they were forced to forfeit their bonds in order not to make their scheduled tour of California . They faced Mike Gillespie once more at the St. Charles Theatre , then one of the largest venues in the county , and fought four rounds before ending the match for a wrestler vs. boxer match between Charles Bixamos and local lightweight boxer Pat Kendrick .
On October 6 , 1884 , Mahan fought exhibition bouts against Mike Cleary and Jack Burke at Turn Hall in New York City . They later joined Sullivan on another national tour organized by manager Pat Sheedy and included Joe Lannon , George La Blanche , Jimmy Carroll and Patsy Kerrigan . They fought Jimmy Carroll to 3 rounds at the Masonic Hall in Portland , Oregon on December 10 . On March 28 , 1887 , they and Joe Lannon sparred with Sullivan in Hoboken , New Jersey . They would continue to face Sullivan for several months and , three months before Sullivan embarked on a tour of Europe , Mahan facing them for the last time in Boston on August 8 , 1887 .
Mahan 's last recorded fight was reportedly in Sligo , Ireland against Peter Maher to whom they lost in a 3-round knockout in 1891 . According to Harry Hill , while testifying before the Lexow Committee , they claimed that Mahan was working as a bartender in Boston when questioned by lawyer John Goff .
In popular culture
Mahan was portrayed in the 1945 movie The Great John L. being introduced as Sullivan 's undefeated opponent `` with 21 straight wins '' .

The 2002 UK & Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the 76th year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland .
Roll of honour
Summary
The National Greyhound Racing Club ( NGRC ) released the annual returns , with totalisator turnover at £92,723,060 from 6190 meetings .
Droopys Rhys trained by Ted Soppitt was voted Greyhound of the Year . The blue dog had finished third in the Scottish Greyhound Derby behind Priceless Rebel before travelling to Ireland and staying with Reggie Roberts when finishing runner-up in the Irish Greyhound Derby behind Bypass Byway . They had missed the English Derby before winning the Steel City Cup and Select Stakes . It had transpired that during that Irish Derby final Droopys Rhys had sustained a fracture on the hock and was later retired . Linda Jones was voted Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the second successive year .
An opportunity was missed by the track promoters as the British Greyhound Racing Board announced they were looking for a 'New Deal ' . The BGR Fund stood at £5 million and the BGRB headed by Chief Executive Geoffrey Thomas demanded a better deal , they drew up controversial plans to control the intellectual property rights and a continued battle ensued . The Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service were unwilling to pay more and significantly increased the prize money at the bookmaker owned tracks in an attempt to combat the threat of property rights . William Hill also bought their first greyhound track after securing a deal for Sunderland ; a move seen as a consequence of the politics surrounding the 'New Deal ' . Tracks fearing losing their BAGS contract eventually backed down leaving the industry dependent on bookmaker contributions . The dispute continued with regular bitter racing press headlines , the deal eventually died .
Tracks
The BS Group took over from Allied Presentations at Reading to add to their portfolio of tracks that included Swindon , Milton Keynes and Poole .
News
Australian stud dogs have a major influence in the breeding lines , Top Honcho an Australian born black dog became the top sire for the second year running . This further damaged the English breeding and Australian lines very often crossed which could be a problem . Racing Managers also noticed that Australian bred greyhounds brought a lack of track craft and lack of wide runners . Floyd Amphlett had predicted the Australian invasion way back in 1993 .
Charlie Lister suffered a suspected stroke , their head lad Chris Akers took on extra responsibilities at the Newark kennels . Seamus Cahill and Bernie Doyle both joined Wimbledon from Catford and Reading respectively . Kelly Mullins became the third son of former champion trainer Linda Mullins to enter the training ranks , they acquired kennels near Slough and began training in April .
Competitions
The Ladbrokes Summer Stayers Classic was introduced at Monmore with a £7,500 to the winner and £12,000 total prize money giving it Category One status , there were now 34 races listed as category one , a remarkable difference from the original ten classics . The Scottish Greyhound Derby at Shawfield Stadium increased their first prize to £25,000 giving the event the second biggest reward behind the English Derby . Jonathan Hobbs of the Racing Post is instrumental in producing a successful greyhound annual .
Top Savings won the Juvenile by 8¾ lengths . Allen Gift made the Scurry Gold Cup final at Catford but had to be withdrawn , the race was won by Patsy Byrne 's Letter Slippy . Allen Gift never found form again and the Derby champion had the injustice of losing in graded races at home track Hove towards the end of their career .
Brian Clemenson won their first trainers championship before dominating the Cesarewitch with three finalists and the 4-5 favourite Cuba duly won . Cuba finished runner-up to Sheriff Bow Wow in the Grand Prix final at Walthamstow . Sheriff Bow Wow in turn finished runner-up to Alibuk Lad in the St Leger final .
Ireland
Compared to 2001 the Irish year was relatively quiet despite the star greyhound Late Late Show winning the early season BCR Press Easter Cup . By the time they made an attempt at the Derby they were passed their best form ; the Derby went to Bypass Byway who was duly voted Irish Dog of the Year .

A falkusa ( ; ) is a traditional fishing boat used by fishermen from the town of Komiža on the Adriatic island of Vis , Croatia . Falkuša is a subtype of gajeta , a traditional Dalmatian fishing sailboat , and is sometimes called gajeta falkuša ( ) . Its design was adapted to the specific needs of Komiža fishermen , who went to long fishing expeditions in the open seas , a unique practice in the Adriatic and Mediterranean .
Design and construction
The Falkuša is a unique wooden boat , tapered narrowly on both sides , and is about seven to eight metres in length by 3 metres wide . It had a low draft under a large ( ) lateen sail made from flax , mounted on a mast which was typically as high as the ship was long . It was very fast both under sail and with oar , able to achieve speeds between 8 and 12 knots . Its distinctive feature were two removable wooden side strakes called falke , after which falkuša got its name . The strakes raised the rim of the boat by about half a metre , protecting it from high waves in the open seas . To ease the hauling of the nets , the strakes were removed during fishing . The vessel could carry up to eight tonnes of salted fish barrels .
For its characteristics of toughness and strength , the traditional gajeta falkuša was made only with cypress wood from the volcanic island of Svetac . The keel was made of oak and the shell of larch .
A typical falkuša carried a crew of six men . There were five oars for standing oarsmen which were 7 to 9 meters in length . The fishermen used nets and a feral , a gas or petroleum lamp for attracting fish . Fishing trips lasted 20 to 25 days , to make them financially viable . Duties such as cooking , washing , repairing , sailing between fishing posts and dealing with bad weather left only 10 to 12 days for actual fishing in a typical journey .
Fishermen 's regatta
The main fishing ground exploited by Komiža 's fishermen was the island of Palagruža , approximately to the south-southwest of Vis , which at times was used by fifty or more vessels . On the island there were provisional houses , which they used to store barrels of salted sardines and fishing equipment .
Fishermen of Komiža would hold an annual regatta between Komiža and Palagruža , known as Rota Palagruzona ( `` Palagruža Route '' ) , a trip which would take about 5 hours of sailing with a good wind , or 13 to 16 hours of rowing when wind conditions were poor . The outcome of the regatta was very important , because top finishers won the rights to the best fishing areas around Palagruža for the season , and the other places were taken in the order of arrival .
The first known regatta to Palagruža was held as far back as 1593 making it the oldest fishermen 's regatta in Europe . Komiža 's fishermen met in May 1593 in the Lodge in the town of Hvar . There it was agreed that the race of 74 falkuša boats would start on June 12 . To signal the start of the race a cannon shot would be fired from the newly built town fortress . The fishermen were accompanied by Venetian war galleys in order to protect them from pirates .
With the advent of ship engines , the regatta lost its purpose , and its last edition was held in 1936 . Falkuša was used well into the first half of the 20th century . The last gajeta falkuša of the island of Komiža , named Cicibela , was destroyed and sunk by a storm in the Bay of Porat ( Biševo island ) in 1986 . Today its remains are preserved in the Fishing Museum in Komiža .
Replicas
A replica of a falkuša named Comeza-Lisboa ( `` Komiža-Lisbon '' ) was built in 1997 and exhibited at the 1998 World 's Fair in Lisbon , Portugal . The revival of the falkuša attracted significant interest , and the boat became the subject of five documentary films and an award-winning radio drama . In 1998 the falkuša was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List .
In 1999 under UNESCO and with shipwright 's documentation supplied by Velimir Salamon , a five-metre reduced-scale replica of the legendary falkuša was built . It was named Molo . It was built in Komiža and launched into the sea on Saint Nicholas Day ( December 6 ) . The secretary of the European Maritime Heritage , Thedo Fruithof from Amsterdam , was present at the launch . A second full-scale replica , named Mikula , was finished in 2005 . A third full-scale replica , named Palagruža , was finished in 2015 .

The Carolingian monetary system , also called the Carolingian coinage system or just the Carolingian system , was a currency structure introduced by Charlemagne in the late 8th century as part of a major reform , the effects of which subsequently dominated much of Europe , including Britain , for centuries . It is characterised by having three denominations in the ratio 1:20:240 , the units of which went under different names in the different languages , but which corresponded to the Latin terms libra ( pound ) , solidus ( shilling ) and denarius ( penny ) .
The currency reform carried out by Emperor Charlemagne around 793/794 was of crucial importance to the medieval monetary systems in what became the Holy Roman Empire and more generally affected European coinage for many centuries . Because gold could almost only be obtained through long-distance trade , while conversely there were quite a few silver deposits in Europe north of the Alps , Charlemagne introduced a pure silver currency . The basic weight of the coin became a pfund ( `` pound '' ) , from which 240 pfennigs ( `` pennies '' ) could be struck . This Carolingian pound weighed approx . 408 grammes .
The pfennig and its corresponding entity in other countries was the most important coin of the Middle Ages . The pfund or pound was already a unit of weight and within this system also became a currency unit . The schilling , like the pfund , was not minted for a long time , but used only as a unit of account worth 12 pfennigs .
History and distribution
Antiquity
The coinage system of the classical Roman Empire was originally based on the copper coin , the as ( later made of bronze ) and multiples of this such as denarius = 10 as , quinarius = 5 as , sestercius = 2½ as etc . The silver coin , the denarius , was thus quite common for a period , but Roman accounting was based on the sestercius . During the last centuries of the Empire , numerous changes were made to the coinage system ( e.g . by Augustus in 24 AD , Caracalla in 215 , Aurelian in 274 , Diocletian in 293 , Constantine the Great in 312 , etc. ) . Emperor Diocletian introduced the gold coin , the solidus , with its system of 1 solidus = 10 argentii = 40 nummii = 200 radiates = 500 laureates = 1,000 denarii . Emperor Constantine introduced a modified solidus with a value equal to 72 solidi or one pound ( libra ) of pure gold , and a new accounting for it as 1 solidus = 2 scripula = 3.33 tremisses = 4 semisses = 18 miliarenses = 24 siliquae . Numerous other introductions of new coins and changes in their value meant that in the last days of the kingdom and the following centuries ( the Migration Period ) there was a confusion of different coins and associated weight and measure systems in circulation .
Charlemagne 's reforms
Charlemagne 's father , Pippin the Younger , began the overhaul of these systems by closing the mints of the great magnates and prelates of the Empire and establishing minting rights as an exclusively royal privilege . However , there were still 22 schillings to the imperial pound , the extra 2 schillings going to the mintmaster and the Imperial Treasury , leaving 20 to be issued into circulation .
This subsequently gave Charlemagne the power to put an end to the currency confusion by introducing a new standardised system that was the most wide-ranging and long-lasting of all the reforms , but was part of a much broader standardisation intended to make the Empire more governable . They defined the Carolingian pound ( libra ) as a new unit of weight , significantly larger than the old Roman pound of 328.9 g. They introduced a new silver coin called the denarius , of which 240 made up 1 pound of pure silver . A denar or denier thus contained 1.7 g of silver . To facilitate the handling of monetary calculations , they also introduced a unit of account , the solidus , so that 1 solidus = 12 denarii . Thus began the characteristic tripartite accountancy system ( L 1 = 20s = 240d ) .
First period
From AD 771 , the new coinage system was introduced throughout the Carolingian Frankish Empire , which at that time extended across modern France , the Benelux , and most of Germany and Italy . The majority of denar coins of this period had a standard design with , on one side , the name of the Emperor on two lines thus : C A R o / L U S. On the other side gave the location of the mint , for example , for Liège : L E o / D I C o .
Second period
In around 793 or 794 , the Carolingian pound , or Karlspfund ( ) , was introduced as the basis of the system of weights and coinage in the Empire . At some point Charlemagne scrapped the old 22 schilling system and the Treasury and mintmasters were now paid from taxes . Thus 1 Pfund generated 20 schillings , each worth 12 denarii . In 174 a decree was issued that the novi denarii were to be used and accepted throughout the Empire ; they would be of pure silver and display Charlemagne 's name on them . So on one side was the inscription CARLVS REX FR ( `` Charles , King of the Franks '' ) and , on the other , as before , the place where the mint was located , e.g . DORESTADO ( `` Dorestad '' ) . There were around sixty mints .
Third period
Even after Charlemagne was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 800 , denarii continued to bear their old title except for what appear to be a small number of `` specials '' which bear their bust and the inscription KAROLUS IMP AVG ( `` Charles , Emperor Augustus '' ) . Meanwhile , the pound and the schilling remained purely units of weight or accounting and were not issued as coins . Although some gold coins appeared under Louis the Pious , the denarius remained the most important coin of the Middle Ages .
Distribution
The new currency also spread to neighbouring countries . At the end of the 8th century , King Offa of Mercia introduced the system into the British Isles to facilitate transactions with the Catholic Church , not least the payment of the tax known as the Alms of St Peter or Peter 's Pence , the denier having been renamed the 'penny ' . In England , however , the new currency system endured long competition from the Viking coinage system , which was introduced into the Danelaw and was based on settlement in marks . Although the £sd system eventually came to dominate in England , the mark-based system continued to be used in the North Sea region and areas with Hanseatic influence for most of the Middle Ages .
The new three-part system came to dominate most of Europe . In French the three units became known as livre , sous and denier , in Italia as the lira , soldo and denaro , in the German states as the Pfund , Schilling and Pfennig and in England as the pound , shilling and penny . The English word 'pound ' comes from the Latin libra pondo , ' a pound weight ' . On the Iberian Peninsula , the Kingdom of Aragon introduced the Carolingian system , rendered in Catalan as the lliura , sou and diner , while the kingdoms of Portugal and Castile ( and then Spain ) retained the coinage system inherited from Islamic al-Andalus era , where the predominant coin was the maravedi with its various multiples and subdivisions . In the Holy Roman Empire , the name denarius or denar was superseded by pfennig during the 10th century .
Subsequent development
In the early Middle Ages , only the denarius was physically minted and issued into circulation as an actual coin , while the libra and solidus were purely units of account . Since the coins were initially based solely on a silver standard , it was a monometallic system and , as long as the silver content of the denarius was maintained constantly , any amount of money could be worked out by counting coins instead of weighing silver or gold . But the gradual exhaustion of European silver mines in the 11th century led to a shortage of silver and made it difficult to maintain the value of the coin . The continuous debasement of coins led from the 13th century to the minting of larger coins . It also led to it becoming commonplace to state the origin of the coin in contracts and accounts . A denier parisis minted in Paris , for example , contained more pure silver than the corresponding denier tournois minted in Tours . The unity of the pound weight and the currency pound , achieved under Charlemagne , was increasingly undermined and led to a divergence of the real value of a coin and its nominal value . This followed Gresham 's Law which argues that `` bad money displaces good money '' . Pfennigs became ever lighter as the heavier coins were melted down for their greater silver content and as mints issued lighter coins to increase their profits .
The fiction that 240 pfennigs made a pfund ( pound of silver ) was doggedly maintained into the Early Modern Period , but the reality was they weighed considerably less . The same problem affected the Mark which was theoretically worth 120 pfennigs but such was the debasement of the latter that the Mark rose eventually to be worth 160 pfennigs . As well as the weight , the silver content of the coins was deliberately reduced such that pfennigs minted in the Duchy of Austria in the late 15th century were nicknamed Schinderlings ( `` little floggers '' , a pejorative term . ) .
To facilitate larger transactions , gold coins began to be minted in western Europe around the same time – starting in the Italian republics in the mid-13th century ( `` florins '' and `` ducats '' ) , and in other kingdoms in the 14th century ( e.g . `` ecu d'or '' in France , the `` noble '' in England ) . Gold coins typically represented larger nominal sums , but they also introduced a bimetallic system of currency which depended on the values of two precious metals . The French `` franc '' , introduced in 1360 , was the first coin anywhere to represent exactly £1 . The gold `` sovereign '' , first minted in 1489 , was the first English £1 coin .
Decimalisation
Having long abandoned the decimal currency structure of the Roman Empire in favour of Carolingian coinage systems , Europe began to return to decimal currencies in the 18th century .
18th century
Russia was the first country to adopt a decimal currency during the reign of Tsar Peter the Great in 1704 , under whom the rouble was worth 100 kopecks . The rouble was thus the world 's first decimal currency since Roman times . However , there were still non-decimal coins in circulation , the 3 kopeck and 15 kopeck denominations , and these would remain part of Russian , and later Soviet , currency until the 1990s .
France introduced the franc and the centime in 1795 , replacing the livre , sou , and denier , abolished during the French Revolution . France introduced decimalisation in a number of countries that it invaded during the Napoleonic period .
19th century
In the 19th century , more countries switched to decimal currencies . The Netherlands led the way when the Dutch guilder was decimalised in 1817 . Hitherto it had been worth 20 stuivers = 160 duiten = 320 penningen . These coins were scrapped in favour of the cent and there were now 100 centen to the guilder . The last pre-decimal coins were withdrawn from circulation in 1848 .
Sweden introduced decimal currency in 1855 . The riksdaler was divided into 100 öre . The riksdaler was renamed the krona in 1873 .
The Austro-Hungarian Empire decimalised the Austro-Hungarian florin in 1857 , concurrent with its transition from the Conventionsthaler to the Vereinsthaler standard .
Spain introduced its decimal currency unit , the peseta , in 1868 , replacing all previous currencies .
20th century
Decimalisation continued in the 20th century . For example , Cyprus decimalised the Cypriot pound in 1955 , which comprised 1,000 mils , later replaced by 100 cents .
The United Kingdom and Ireland decimalised the pound and punt , respectively , in 1971 . ( See £sd and Decimal Day . )
Malta decimalised the lira in 1972 .
Nigeria was the last country to abandon the Carolingian system , in 1973 , when the pound was replaced by the naira .

Karl Ludwig Wilhelm Zanth , from 1844 von Zanth , also Zandt ( 6 August 1796 – 7 October 1857 ) was a German architect , architecture critic and watercolor painter .
Life and career
Born in Breslau , Zanth was the son of the Jewish doctor Abraham Zadig , who was in the service of the Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen . The father converted to Christianity in 1820 and the family took the name `` Zanth '' . Ludwig Zanth attended the art and building school in Breslau . In 1808 , the family moved to Kassel . Thanks to a scholarship from the Kingdom of Westphalia , Zanth was able to attend the École polymatique and the Lycée Bonaparte in Paris in the summer and autumn of 1813 . At the end of 1813 , their father sent their son to Stuttgart , where they completed their school education , especially in the classical languages Latin and Greek , at the Gymnasium . Subsequently , Zanth completed an apprenticeship in the architectural office of the court master builder Ferdinand von Fischer . After stays in Schwäbisch Hall , Ellwangen and Paris , where they contributed to two theatre buildings and converted from the Protestant faith to Catholicism , they settled as an architect in Stuttgart in 1831 . There they were responsible for the interior design of the Wilhelm Palais , which was built from 1834 to 1840 . King Wilhelm I had this magnificent building , constructed in the classical style , built for their daughters Marie and Sophie .
In 1835 , Zanth entered the competition for the construction of a new Royal Court Theatre in Stuttgart . However , the project was not realised . In 1835/36 they planned a house for in Heilbronn , in 1836/37 the for and in 1838 a country house for . In the same year , they drew up the plans for the Wilhelma Theatre in Bad Cannstatt , a building in the style of the French Renaissance with painting in the `` Pompeian '' style , which was completed in 1840 . Subsequently , King Wilhelm I of Württemberg entrusted them with the planning and execution of a public bath in the midst of exotic greenhouses and parks in the immediate vicinity of the Wilhelma Theatre . From 1843 onwards , Zanth planned the Moorish style complex , which was named Wilhelma on the king 's instructions , today the name of the zoological-botanical garden located there . It was inaugurated as the in 1846 . The magnificent building was such a success that the architect produced a large-format portfolio of coloured drawings about it . King Wilhelm I of Württemberg appointed them Court Architect and awarded them the Knight 's Cross of the Order of the Crown in 1844 . This was connected with their elevation to the personal nobility .
The architect was also a talented draughtsman . A still preserved watercolour in the bears witness to their talent .
Zanth died in Stuttgart at the age of 59 and found their final resting place in the . However , the inscription on their gravestone has weathered beyond recognition .

Mx ( usually pronounced , or and sometimes ) is an English language neologistic honorific that does not indicate gender . Developed as an alternative to gendered honorifics ( such as Mr. and Ms. ) in the late 1970s , it is the most common gender-neutral title among non-binary people and people who do not wish to imply a gender in their titles . Mx . is widely accepted by the Government of the United Kingdom and many businesses in the United Kingdom , and is also in many English dictionaries .
Etymology
The word was first proposed in the late 1970s . The `` x '' is intended to stand as a wildcard character , and does not necessarily imply a `` mixed '' gender .
Usage
In 2013 , Brighton and Hove City Council in Sussex , England , voted to allow the use of Mx on council forms , and in 2014 the Royal Bank of Scotland included the title as an option for customers . In 2015 , recognition spread more broadly across UK institutions , including the Royal Mail , government agencies responsible for documents such as driving licences , most major banks , several other companies , and UK charity Battersea Dogs & Cats Home .
The title is now accepted by the Department for Work and Pensions , HM Revenue and Customs , the National Health Service and many councils , universities , insurance companies and utility retailers in the United Kingdom . The House of Commons of the United Kingdom confirmed in 2015 that it would accept the use of Mx by MPs .
In 2015 , Mx was included in a New York Times article about Bluestockings . Its casual usage in the paper was picked up by popular news sites and blogs . The Times 's standards editor Phil Corbett later responded to the usage of the title . Later the same year , Mx was included in the Oxford English Dictionary . In 2016 , Metro Bank became the first bank in the United Kingdom to offer Mx on its forms ( though other banks had amended records to Mx on request prior to this ) . In 2017 , banks of the HSBC Group announced the addition of Mx alongside several other gender-neutral titles as options for their customers . HSBC 's 30 March announcement coincided with the International Transgender Day of Visibility , celebrated the following day .
In March 2021 , Oscar Davies , a non-binary barrister from the United Kingdom , became the first person to use `` Mx '' ( instead of Mr/Ms ) on the board of their chambers .
Although Mx remains uncommon in the United States , in April 2016 it was added to the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary .
Mixter is sometimes treated as a long form of the title ( like Mister is of Mr ) . An informal study in 2019 found that 1.9 % of the 896 participants worldwide pronounce it `` Mixter '' ( ) while most pronounce it `` Mix '' ( ) or `` Məx '' ( ) ( with a schwa ) .
Indian airlines Vistara and AirAsia India , both Tata Group companies , added Mx as a third option for passengers booking flights from June 2022 .

The Hugo Award for Best Novella is one of the Hugo Awards given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories published or translated into English during the previous calendar year . The novella award is available for works of fiction of between 17,500 and 40,000 words ; awards are also given out in the short story , novelette and novel categories . The Hugo Awards have been described as `` a fine showcase for speculative fiction '' and `` the best known literary award for science fiction writing '' .
The Hugo Award for Best Novella has been awarded annually since 1968 . In addition to the regular Hugo awards , beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards , or `` Retro Hugos '' , have been available to be awarded for years 50 , 75 , or 100 years prior in which no awards were given . Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were originally given . To date , Retro Hugo awards have been given for novellas for 1939 , 1941 , 1943–1946 , 1951 , and 1954 .
During the 63 nomination years , 183 authors have had works nominated ; 47 of these have won , including coauthors and Retro Hugos . Connie Willis has received the most Hugos for Best Novella at four , and at eight is tied for the most nominations with Robert Silverberg at eight . Willis and Charles Stross at three out of four nominations are the only authors to have won more than twice , while thirteen other authors have won the award twice . Nancy Kress has earned seven nominations and Robert A. Heinlein , George R. R. Martin , Seanan McGuire , Kim Stanley Robinson , and Lucius Shepard six , and are the only authors besides Willis and Silverberg to get more than five . Robinson has the highest number of nominations without winning .
Selection
Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by the supporting and attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention , or Worldcon , and the presentation evening constitutes its central event . The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees , except in the case of a tie . These novellas on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year , with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated . Initial nominations are made by members in January through March , while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July , subject to change depending on when that year 's Worldcon is held . Prior to 2017 , the final ballot was five works ; it was changed that year to six , with each initial nominator limited to five nominations . Worldcons are generally held near the start of September , and are held in a different city around the world each year . Members are permitted to vote `` no award '' , if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year , and in the case that `` no award '' takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category . This happened in the Best Novella category in 2015 .
Winners and nominees
In the following table , the years correspond to the date of the ceremony , rather than when the novella was first published . Each year links to the corresponding `` year in literature '' . Entries with a blue background have won the award ; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list . If the novella was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine , the book title is included after the publisher 's name .
* Winners and joint winners

Retro Hugos
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon , the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of `` Retro Hugos '' , in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for years 50 , 75 , or 100 years before the current year , if no awards were originally given that year . Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times , for 1939 , 1941 , 1943–1946 , 1951 , and 1954 .

The Jos Plateau indigobird ( Vidua maryae ) is a species of bird in the family Viduidae . It is endemic to Nigeria . It lays its eggs in the nest of the rock firefinch which is also restricted to Nigeria . Because of their inability to incubate their eggs , they lay their eggs in the nest of the rock firefinch and then take away the exact number of laid eggs from the host bird in order to avoid suspicion from the host bird . After hatching they exhibit dominance against the hatchlings of the rock firefinchers . Their breeding seasons are all round the year but more pronounced during the cold Harmattan period between July and December .
Its natural habitats are dry woodland and shrubland in rocky areas . It is threatened by habitat loss .

Elliot Danforth ( March 6 , 1850 – January 7 , 1906 ) was an American lawyer and politician .
Life
They were born on March 6 , 1850 , in Middleburgh , Schoharie County , New York , the son of Peter S. Danforth , a justice of the New York Supreme Court . They studied law with their father and was admitted to the bar in 1872 . On December 17 , 1874 , they married Ida Prince , and they had a son , Edward Danforth , and a daughter . In 1878 , they removed to Bainbridge , N.Y. , where their father-in-law was President of the First National Bank . There , Danforth practiced law in partnership with George H. Winsor , and was President of the Corporation of Bainbridge .
They were a delegate to the 1880 and 1884 , 1888 , 1892 , 1896 , 1900 and 1904 Democratic National Conventions .
They were Deputy Treasurer under Lawrence J. Fitzgerald from 1885 to 1889 , and was New York State Treasurer from 1890 to 1893 , elected in 1889 and 1891 .
In November 1891 , they were a member of the State Board of Canvassers ( made up by the Secretary of State , Treasurer , Comptroller , Attorney General and State Engineer ) , when the electoral fraud in the Dutchess County senatorial election happened by which Governor David B. Hill gained control of the New York State Senate . The Republican candidate Gilbert A. Deane had received 78 votes more than Democrat Edward B. Osborne , but the Board changed 92 votes and declared Osborne elected by a plurality of 14 . The New York Supreme Court issued a writ to Danforth , ordering them to certify the election of Deane , but Danforth refused to obey . For this they and the other members of the Board were fined $ 500 by Justice D. Cady Herrick . The sentence was later upheld by the New York Court of Appeals .
In August 1893 , it became known that Danforth had received a loan of $ 50,000 ( about seven times the annual salary of the Treasurer ) from the Madison Square Bank in New York City in exchange for keeping a large amount of State monies in that bank . Danforth managed to withdraw the State 's $ 250,000 from the bank in the early hours of August 9 , the day the bank ( of which Fitzgerald was a director ) closed .
After leaving the Treasury , they resumed the practice of law at New York City . From 1896 to 1898 , they were Chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee , and in 1897 campaigned successfully for the election of Alton B. Parker as Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals . In 1898 , they ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York with Augustus Van Wyck but they were narrowly defeated by Theodore Roosevelt and Timothy L. Woodruff .
They died on January 7 , 1906 , at their home at 51 , East 58th Street in Manhattan , of pneumonia , and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx .

Florence Mill , also known as the Weber Mill , is a historic mill located at 9102 North 30th Street near the 30th Street exit on I-680 in the Florence community in North Omaha , Nebraska . It was built in 1846 and operated into the 1960s . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Weber Mill in 1998 . The mill is also known as the Mormon Mill , Grist Mill , and Old Pink Mill . It is now operated as the Winter Quarters Mill Museum and ArtLoft Gallery .
History
Brigham Young supervised construction by the Mormon pioneers of Winter Quarters in 1846 . The Florence Mill is the only surviving building to have been built by the Mormons . The settlers needed a mill to grind corn , wheat , and rye to create cornmeal and flour products . Constructed next to Turkey Creek , later called Mill Creek , which flowed into the Missouri River , the original structure was deserted in 1846 . A new mill was built in 1847 at the cost of $ 3000 . Brigham Young sold this mill to John Neff , who deserted it when they moved to Salt Lake City .
Alexander Hunter began operating the Mill in 1856 , helping to fill the demands of the new town of Florence , founded in 1854 on the old site of Winter Quarters . They tore down the original mill , reusing some of the good timbers to build a new mill .
Weber family
Jacob Weber acquired the Mill around 1860 , replacing water-powered machinery with new steam-powered equipment . The Weber family operated the Florence Mill continuously for over 104 years , contributing to the development of the milling industry between the last half of the nineteenth century into the twentieth century . The Weber 's business was long considered to be the longest operating business in Nebraska .
Winter Quarters Mill Museum and ArtLoft Gallery
The mill is now operated as the Winter Quarters Mill Museum and ArtLoft Gallery . The museum features pioneer-era historic photos , 1854 newspaper clippings and agricultural artifacts . The mill also hosts a farmers market from June through the end of September .
Contrary to previously published reports , Omaha billionaire Warren Buffett has not been actively involved in a drive to renovate the structure .

Westfalia Rhynern is a German association football club from the district of Rhynern in the city of Hamm , Westphalia .
History
The club was established in 1935 as Turn- und Sportverein Rhynern , but disappeared after two years when , like many other clubs , it was caught up in the politically motivated sports policies of the Nazi regime . Following World War II , a group that included many of the club 's pre-war membership reformed the club in 1946 as Sportverein Westfalia Rhynern .
The footballers advanced to the Verbandsliga Westfalen ( V ) in 1997 and two years later narrowly missed promotion to the Oberliga Westfalen ( IV ) when they finished just two points behind champions SC Herford . In 2002 , the team slipped to the Landesliga Westfalen ( VI ) after losing a decisive match to Borussia Emsdetten . They immediately returned to fifth-tier play the next season and in 2006 finished as runners-up in the division . Westfalia captured the championship in 2010 and moved up to the NRW-Liga ( V ) . Since 2012 the club has played in the tier-five Oberliga Westfalen except for one season in the Regionalliga West in 2017–18 .

Founded in 1956 , the school is administered by the Education Commission of Chaoyang District and the teaching activities are organised into Junior High ( from Year 7 to Year 9 ) and Senior High ( from Year 10 to Year 12 ) . It occupies currently two campuses amounting to ca . 8.65 acres ( 35,000 m3 ) , featuring 24 Junior and 12 Senior teaching classes .
The High School Affiliated to Beijing International Studies University ( ) is not to be confused with another public school in the district , 中国旅游学院附属中学 ( ) , literally the High School Affiliated to China Tourism Institute . While China Tourism Institute was another name for Beijing International Studies University during the 1980s and 1990s , it is more of a historical term , i.e . a China Tourism Institute does not currently exist in China . In addition , although the school names itself BISU Junior High School in English ( according to its website ) , there is no official link between the school and the university .
History
The school as a whole was officially established in 2000 as a merger of three high schools in the neighbourhood . Its predecessors include Guanzhuang High School and Yangzha High School , both founded in 1956 , and the 1983-founded Guanzhuang II High School . Shortly after the establishment , the same year in July , the school was named High School affiliated to China Building Materials Academy . In 2011 , it became the affiliated school to Beijing International Studies University under the collaborative agreement between the Chaoyang Education Commission and the University .

The lower reaches of the glacier were first roughly surveyed in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition ( BGLE ) under Rymill . Resurveyed in 1948-49 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey ( FIDS ) , who so named it for its association with Romulus Glacier , whose head lies near the head of this glacier .

Georgina Kinnear ( 1820 – 26 April 1914 ) was a British principal .
Life
Kinnear was born in Edinburgh in 1820 . Them brothers were educated by tutors , but Kinnear taught themselves rising at 5 a.m. each morning . They were able to poach some language teaching from their brother 's tutors . They were the daughter of John Gardner Kinnear FRSE , a business person and founder of John G. Kinnear & Co , commission merchants based at 17 St Vincent Place in the city centre . The family lived at 137 Clarence Place in Glasgow . Them younger brother became Alexander Kinnear , 1st Baron Kinnear and their uncle was James Kinnear FRSE ( 1810–1849 ) . All were descended from the Edinburgh banking firm of Thomas Kinnear and Sons .
Kinnear traveled abroad and increased their knowledge of French and German . In 1860 they were employed by the British minister Lord and Lady Ann Napier to educate their children at their home in the Netherlands . The minister family moved to Russia in 1861 and there they taught themselves Russian so well that they were able to take a job with a Russian family .
Kinnear became the head of the Park School for Girls in Glasgow in 1880 . The school was a new one opened by the Glasgow Girls School Company which had been formed by local business people the year before . Despite being largely self taught Kinnear came with glowing recommendations from the school 's they had worked at previously . Kinnear was allowed to develop the school as they saw fit . They were shocked by the complacency of others to the lack of education for girls .
When they retired they were replaced by Margaret Paulin Young who had been a founding pupil of the Park School . They had been head girl and was later groomed by Kinnear . Kinnear had sent them to be the founding head of St Columba 's School , Kilmacolm which was a clone of Park School that was also opened by the same company in 1897 . Kinnear , Young and Young 's replace ment are credited with forming St Columba 's school which is still an independent , but co-educational , school in 2019 .
Kinnear died in Edinburgh in 1914 after spending some time speaking mostly in Russian .

John Lindsay ( 6 January 1876 – 12 December 1957 ) was an Australian politician who served as a Country Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1924 to 1933 . They were a minister in the government of Sir James Mitchell .
Early life
Lindsay was born in Glasgow , Scotland , to Sarah ( née Gillies ) and William Lindsay . They arrived in Western Australia as a young man , having earlier spent two years in Queensland . During the Boer War , Lindsay served two tours of duty with a Western Australian regiment . They were refused permission to re-enlist after their first tour of duty , but supposedly stowed away on a troop ship and talked their way into continuing to serve . After the war 's end , Lindsay did not return to Australia until 1905 , when they took up land at Wyalkatchem as one of the region 's first settlers . They were elected to the Dowerin Road Board in 1912 , and then switched to the Wyalkatchem Road Board upon its creation in 1920 .
Politics and later life
Lindsay entered parliament at the 1924 state election , winning the seat of Toodyay from the sitting Country member , Alfred Piesse . They and Piesse belonged to separate factions of the party , which had split in 1923 due to disputes over the coalition with the Nationalist Party . Lindsay was re-elected to Toodyay with an increased majority at the 1927 election . They switched to the new seat of Mount Marshall at the 1930 election , which saw a victory for the Nationalist–Country coalition , and was subsequently appointed to cabinet as Minister for Public Works and Minister for Labour .
At the 1933 state election , both Lindsay and the Mitchell government were defeated . They were one of four government ministers to lose their seats ( along with Mitchell , John Scaddan , and Hubert Parker ) , although their defeat was to an `` Independent Country '' candidate , Frederick Warner . Lindsay stood for East Province at the 1936 Legislative Council election , but was defeated by Garnet Wood . They made one final run for parliament at the 1943 state election , but lost to Hugh Leslie . Lindsay retired to Perth , dying there in 1957 , aged 81 . They had married Annie Sherwood in 1911 , with whom they had four children .

The African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedoms ( AfDec ) has been created in order to promote an Internet environment that conforms to established human rights standards and meets Africa 's social and economic development needs . The Declaration was agreed on at the 2013 African Internet Governance Forum ( AfIGF ) in Nairobi , Kenya and launched in 2014 at the global Internet Governance Forum in Istanbul , Turkey . It provides a normative framework on which basis recommendations for policy and legislative processes on internet rights , freedoms and governance in Africa are made . They can be applied at national , sub-regional and regional levels .
Background
The AfDec has been developed in response to the increasing access of Africans to the internet . With millions of people engaging online on issues such as political , social , economic and governance matters , many African countries try to control the internet in some kind of way . For example , in 2022 , the number of internet users in Africa rose to 565 million , which is six times more than the amount of users in 2010 . However , many African countries adopted problematic regulations from other countries , which often fail to protect human rights but rather violate them . As an example , China is trying to export its Internet technology to Africa , which is based on an authoritarian cyberspace governance model , in attempt to extend their influence as a 'cyberspace superpower ' . As a result , many African countries transformed from low to highly regulated internet environments , not only preventing crime but also restricting critical voices such as criticism of governments . Hence , the AfDec tries `` to elaborate on the principles which are necessary to uphold human and people 's rights on the Internet , and to cultivate an Internet environment that can best meet Africa 's social and economic development needs and goals '' . The AfDec emerged from different issues and trends in Internet regulation and Internet rights that are described in a background paper .
Drafting and design
The African Declaration of Internet Rights and Freedom is built on well-established African human rights documents including the African Charter on Human and Peoples ' Rights ( 1981 ) , the Windhoek Declaration on Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press ( 1991 ) , the African Charter on Broadcasting ( 2001 ) , the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa ( 2002 ) and the African Platform on Access to Information Declaration ( 2011 ) . The AfDec was envisioned at the 2013 African Internet Governance Forum meeting in Nairobi , Kenya . Subsequently , the drafting process began at a following meeting in 2014 . The drafters ' group was led by Edetaen Ojo ( executive director of Media Rights Agenda ) and developed the contents , purpose and text for the Declaration . They received feedback from an online public consultation and African and international stakeholders .
At the beginning of the drafting process , it became clear that there already have been successful regional projects in the past which defined regional standards for Internet freedom . Those initiatives had an enormous impact in building movements and raising awareness on the highest political levels . The following challenge was to bring these ideas , improvements and goals together into one document for which a meeting in February 2014 was scheduled . This meeting was used to start and build a shared civil society campaign and develop purposes and strategies for the design of an African Declaration of Internet Rights and Freedom .
The drafting started with evaluating the existing principles and Charters , figuring out their main goals and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses . The participants were then divided into groups based on their regional origin and determined their top priorities for a Declaration . “ Based on the priorities identified above , participants broke into issue-based groups . Each group picked a priority issue from the lists developed and explored the challenges associated with that right which could be addressed in a Declaration ; existing standards in relation to that issue ; and what demands should be included in any Declaration with regards to that issue. ” Consequently , a list of possible allies was developed , which should be used to gain support and expand the reach of the Declaration . This list included African networks , intergovernmental organizations , funders and donors as well as international supporters .
At the end of this drafting meeting in February 2014 the title of the Declaration was agreed on and a work schedule for the following 7–12 months was designed . The final draft was available for the public by spring and the launch of the then revised AfDec took place in September 2014 . The goal was set to promote the Declaration further , especially “ in different institutions involved in the dispersed internet governance field , including the African Union and UNESCO ” .
Content
The African Declaration of Internet Rights and Freedoms declares 13 key principles regarding Human Rights on the Internet . The declaration applies to all governments , “ regional and sub-regional bodies , national governments , civil society organisations , media institutions and relevant Internet companies ” . It states that national governments must take measures to “ respect , protect and guarantee the rights outlined in this declaration ” . These include providing legal frameworks and effective remedies against violations as well as ensuring transparent , well-resourced , independent regulators on the Internet . In practice , the declaration announces that states should implement actions or intensify them and adopt best practices from other African states .
Key principles
The key principles include :
An open infrastructure on the Internet , which allows for the distribution of ideas and a public discourse without discrimination . The restriction of Internet access or speed shall not be permitted .
Access to the Internet for all people in Africa without discrimination based on “ race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ”
Freedom of expression . Any restrictions must be “ provided by law , pursue a legitimate aim as expressly listed under international human rights law ( namely the rights or reputations of others , the protection of national security , or of public order , public health or morals ) and are necessary and proportionate in pursuance of a legitimate aim ” . With reference to the Manila Principle of Intermediary Liability it holds that only the author themselves can be held liable for the content and not the platform on which it is published .
The right to information . This information that are produced on public funds have to be made accessible to the people according to minimum standards .
The freedom to use the Internet for assembly and association . Any restrictions must be “ provided by law , pursue a legitimate aim as expressly listed under international human rights law ( namely the rights or reputations of others , the protection of national security , or of public order , public health or morals ) and are necessary and proportionate in pursuance of a legitimate aim ” .
The right to freely choose any language when sharing information on the Internet .
The opportunity to use the Internet to make use of one 's right to sustainable development .
The right to privacy and data protection , specifically the right to anonymity . Any restrictions must be “ provided by law , pursue a legitimate aim as expressly listed under international human rights law ( namely the rights or reputations of others , the protection of national security , or of public order , public health or morals ) and are necessary and proportionate in pursuance of a legitimate aim ” .
The aim of a trustworthy , stable Internet that is based on cooperation of its stakeholders . Any unlawful surveillance shall not be permitted .
The rejection of discrimination and of violations of human rights . States are required to provide a safe environment for free speech . This includes the environment on the Internet and laws for protecting those who engage in public discourse such as journalists and women 's and human rights defenders .
The right to a fair process for every individual concerning legal claims with regards to the use of the Internet . States must provide equal protection under the law and arbitrary detention or punishment thus shall not be allowed .
The right for everyone to participate in an open governance of the Internet . The declaration may not be used to justify the prevention of equality .
The recognition of existing gender inequalities in knowledge about and accessing the Internet . This recognition is the premise to be able to tackle them and achieve equal access .
Reactions and supporters
Since the establishment of the Declaration of Internet Rights and Freedoms the group has been active on social media under the Twitter account @ AfricaNetRights , promoting their publications from the website updates as well as projects from similar organizations and projects concerning the Internet freedom of Africa . As of mid-June 2022 , the declaration has been endorsed by 45 African countries , 9 non-African countries , 151 organizations , and 186 Individuals ( totalling 369 supporters ) .

Lies ( 거짓말 , Gojitmal ) is a South Korean erotic drama film adapted from the banned novel Tell me a Lie by Jang Jung Il , which depicts a sadomasochistic sexual relationship between a 38-year-old sculptor and an 18-year-old highschool student . The film was shot in a semi-cinéma vérité style and features interviews with the author and cast spliced in between scenes . Intended to provoke , the film contains full-frontal nudity , unsimulated sex , coprophilia , and criticisms of South Korean society . It was heavily censored upon its initial release in South Korea but international releases were left uncut .
Synopsis
Y is an 18 year-old highschool senior whose friend Woori has struck up a correspondence with J , a 38 year-old sculptor . After talking to them on the phone , they are aroused by the sound of their voice and arranges to meet them at a love hotel so they can have their first sexual encounter on their own terms instead of losing their virginity to rape like their two sisters did . The two have sex as soon as they enter the motel and proceed to have anal and oral sex . In their next tryst , they confide in them their interest in sadomasochism and they allow them to beat them on their buttocks before they have sex again .
As time goes on , they engage in regular trysts where they beat them with increasing intensity , using a wide variety of implements . At first , Y only goes along with it to make J happy , telling Woori that they desire whatever they do , but they eventually take a liking to being beaten . When J visits their wife in Paris , their relationship with their wife deteriorates when they beg them to beat him ; they refuse and the film reveals that their sexual desires have been a strain on their marriage for years .
After an unusually intense beating , Y becomes angry and J offers to let them beat him . They assume the dominant role in the relationship and they ultimately take turns beating each other . Y 's brother discovers the affair and sets fire to J 's house . Y cuts their hair and drops out of university and J leaves home and they spend the remainder of their relationship living in hotels , having sex every night , carving tattoos onto their inner thighs , forgoing work and rejecting society . When Y 's brother dies in a motorcycle accident and when J runs out of money , Y leaves J in spite of their pleas for them not to . J ultimately moves to Paris to live with theirs wife .
Years later , J receives a phone call from Y , who is stopping over in Paris on their way to South America to live with their sister . They meet one last in a hotel and they change into their old school uniform and beats them with the handle of a pickaxe , fulfilling a fantasy they once expressed to them After the encounter , they never see each other again . When J asks them where they got the tattoo , they lie .

Surf is the second solo album by Scottish singer–songwriter Roddy Frame , first released in the UK on 5 August 2002 via Redemption Records , and in the US on 8 October 2002 via Cooking Vinyl . Surf is notable in that every song on the album was recorded in Roddy Frame 's `` own front room '' .
Critical reception
Surf received generally positive reviews upon release . Burhan Wazir , writing for The Observer , likened the album to Steve Earle 's Train a Comin ' , declaring it `` wonderfully understated '' , and noting a distinct departure from Frame 's previous material ; `` There are few signatures here that have come to mark the work of Roddy Frame , the Pride of East Kilbride , with their previous band Aztec Camera . That said , Surf is one of their best records since 1987 's breakthrough , Love . It 's a break-up album and the sparse acoustic songs lend Frame a maturity they previously struggled to express . '' Q magazine 's Jon Horsley also noted the difference in sound between Surf and `` all of Frame 's previous work '' . Singling out `` Over You '' and `` Mixed Up Love '' as two of the album 's best tracks , they went on to praise Frame 's vocals , lyrics , and songwriting ability ; `` Simplicity is the key , displaying Frame 's deft hand with a lyric and mastery of direct songwriting . Best of all is Frame 's now beautifully mature voice . '' Noting the record 's `` bare-bones '' sound , Gary Glauber of PopMatters thought that the album comprised `` a pleasant voice , competent musicianship and most important , strong songs '' . Drawing comparison with Ron Sexsmith 's `` best compositions '' , they surmised that Frame manages to succeed `` where lesser talents would fall . ''
Allmusic 's Matt Fink also remarked upon Surf 's `` undiluted format '' , highlighting Frame 's `` clever and consistent '' songwriting ability as two of the album 's most positive aspects . Yet , despite claiming that Frame 's `` knack for subtlety and nuance makes for near perfect acoustic balladry '' , they found fault with both the vocal delivery—which they described as `` indistinctive and overwhelmingly mellow '' —and the record 's `` lack of both sonic and conceptual variation '' . Reviewing the album for The Guardian , Adam Sweeting also bemoaned the album 's lack of diversity in which they felt that `` Frame tends to stick to a fairly narrow palette of musical shapes and chord patterns '' , but also declared there to be `` some treats if sampled sparingly '' , most notably `` Over You '' , `` I Ca n't Start Now '' and `` Big Ben '' . The Independent 's Andy Gill highlighted `` Frame 's slightly sour vocals '' —which they described as having `` a desolate purity that recalls the draft-dodging Seventies troubadour Jesse Winchester '' —but ultimately found Surf to be `` too personal to afford much pleasure to the casual listener '' .

Johann Daniel Witten ( 15 February 1791 – after 1865 ) was the founder of the village of Büchsenschinken in Reinbek , Germany .
They were drafted into the Danish military and stationed in Altona in 1815 due to the Napoleonic wars , during which they were wounded .
In 1825 , Witten purchased empty land in what is now Büchsenschinken and was granted permission by the office of Reinbek to build a timber-framed house , which also acted as a farm , during the same year . A few years later they were granted permission to distribute alcohol in at their property . At that point , their property had become a stop along the route from Hamburg to Mölln , and the inn Gasthof Büchsenschinken was established by their son Heinrich-Otto Witten . The inn was in operation until 2005 , and was demolished in 2008 .

Trinity Square is a public square in downtown Toronto , Ontario , Canada . It is bounded on the east by the Toronto Eaton Centre , on the south and west by the Bell Trinity Square office complex , and on the north by the Marriott Downtown Eaton Centre hotel .
The square 's main feature is the Church of the Holy Trinity , an Anglican church . The Holy Trinity Rectory and the Henry Scadding House are heritage buildings that are also located there . The square includes a fountain and ornamental pond , and a labyrinth path .
Trinity Square 's primary street access is via James Street , which extends north from Queen Street West between the Eaton Centre and Toronto 's Old City Hall . The square can also be accessed by walkways from Bay Street and Dundas Street West , as well as through the Eaton Centre .
History
The square was once the 'Terauley ' estate of John Simcoe Macaulay ( Terauley Cottage ) , which had been acquired by their father James Macaulay in 1797 . Macaulay sold the house and land in 1845 , giving land for the construction of the Church of the Holy Trinity .
By 1900 , the area around the church became the Eaton 's Annex . The site of Bell Trinity Square , an office building built in 1982 by John B. Parkin Associates , was once home to the 10-floor Eaton 's House Furnishing Building , built in 1919 .
During the 1970s , the Eaton 's complex came down after a fire and demolition . The church and square were threatened by demolition to make way for the Toronto Eaton Centre . The parishioners of the church successfully resisted and forced the mall 's design to be changed , preserving the church . Protests from Toronto citizens also led to the preservation of Old City Hall south of the square .
Design
The landscaped square is paved with a combination of granite and precast concrete block pavers arranged in different patterns . Its walkways are lined with densely planted trees . There is a water feature consisting of a tall outlet of water falling from a wall into an ornamental pond . Water also flows through an artificial stream beside the walkway to Bay Street . This walkway is designed with the Church of the Holy Trinity as a terminating vista . It also extends views of the church to Hagerman Street on the north side of Toronto City Hall and to the podium of City Hall itself . At Bay Street , the walkway is flanked by two lanterns mounted on tall columns composed of exposed metal frames , painted blue . The columns are defined by three sections , with the widest at the bottom . They are positioned towards the edges of the walkway to complement and frame the two towers of the Church of the Holy Trinity and to provide a formal entrance to the square .
Adjacent to the church is a clock tower similar in scale and construction to the columns at Bay Street . In addition , there are three large colonnade-like structures which serve as an entrance to the Toronto Public Labyrinth . The labyrinth is an ancient symbol dating back more than three thousand years . It is a universal symbol of pilgrimage and of our journey through life . A labyrinth has only one path and , unlike a maze , it has no dead ends . The labyrinth pattern at Trinity Square is based on the eleven-circuit labyrinth constructed at the Chartres Cathedral in France , completed in the 13th century . As many labyrinths are found near the water , this labyrinth is located on the former course of Taddle Creek , a stream that has been buried for more than one hundred and fifty years . The granite blocks that have been set into the paving at the entrance to the labyrinth and the nearby water feature in the square serve as reminders of this buried creek . The labyrinth is oriented in the direction of true north , as indicated by the directional lines created with the granite blocks .

Lancashire , like all other counties of England , has historically had its own peculiar superstitions , manners , and customs , which may or may not find parallels in those of other localities . The following list of folklore of Lancashire was collected in 1851 by one Tattersall Wilkinson of Burnley , as exemplars of the time :
If a person 's hair , when thrown into the fire , burns brightly , it is a sure sign that the individual will live long . The brighter the flame the longer life , and vice versa .
A young person frequently stirs the fire with the poker to test the humour of a lover . If the fire blaze brightly , the lover is good-humoured ; and vice versa .
A crooked sixpence , or a copper coin with a hole through , are accounted lucky coins .
Cutting or paring the nails of the hands or feet on a Friday or Sunday , is very unlucky .
If a person 's left ear burns , or feels hot , somebody is praising the party ; if the right ear burns , then it is a sure sign that some one is speaking evil of the person .
Children are frequently cautioned by their parents not to walk backwards when going an errand ; it is a sure sign that they will be unfortunate in their objects .
A horseshoe is still nailed behind many doors to counteract the effects of witchcraft : a hagstone with a hole through , tied to the key of the stable-door , protects the horses , and , if hung up at the bed 's head , the farmer also .
A hot iron put into the cream during the process of churning , expels the witch from the churn ; and dough in preparation for the baker is protected by being marked with the figure of a cross .
Warts are cured by being rubbed over with a black snail , but the snail must afterwards be impaled upon a hawthorn . If a bag containing as many small pebbles as a person has warts , be tossed over the left shoulder , it will transfer the warts to whoever is unfortunate enough to pick up the bag .
If black snails are seized by the horn and tossed over the left shoulder , the process will insure good luck to the person who performs it .
Profuse bleeding is said to be instantly stopped by certain persons who pretend to possess the secret of a certain form of words which immediately act as a charm .
The power of bewitching , producing evil to parties by wishing it , & c. , is supposed to be transmitted from one possessor to another when one of the parties is about to die . The writer is in possession of full particulars respecting this supposed transfer .
Cramp is effectually prevented by placing the shoes with the toes just peeping from beneath the coverlet ; the same is also prevented by tying the garter round the left leg below the knee .
Charmed rings are worn by many for the cure of dyspepsia ; and so also are charmed belts for the cure of rheumatism .
A red-haired person is supposed to bring in ill-luck if they be the first to enter a house on New Year 's Day . Black-haired persons are rewarded with liquor and small gratuities for `` taking in the new year '' to the principal houses in their respective neighbourhoods .
If any householder 's fire does not burn through the night of New Year 's Eve , it betokens bad luck during the ensuing year ; and if any party allow another a live coal , or even a lighted candle , on such an occasion , the bad luck is extended to the other part for commiserating with the former in their misfortunes .

Cornelia Lucretia Brant ( ; December 16 , 1863 – March 9 , 1959 ) was an American doctor .
After starting a family , they started a medical career as a mature student , graduating from the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women in 1903 . They assumed the position of Dean in 1914 , served as part of the Council of National Defense during the First World War , and then practiced as a GP in Brooklyn from 1918 to 1939 . They were an active club woman and was the president of the Brooklyn Woman 's Club .
Early life
They were born Cornelia `` Nellie '' Lucretia Chase to a Quaker family in Ottawa , Illinois on December 16 , 1863 . Them mother died in childbirth when they were nine and they were then brought up by three aunts in Newark , New Jersey . They ran a school for young ladies with a liberal philosophy , being friends with Susan B. Anthony and Dr Clemence Lozier , who were pioneers of women 's rights . The latter had established the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women in 1863 , pioneering medical education for women . This acquaintance and the male medical establishment 's failure to care for women in their life established a desire to become a doctor in the young woman .
To prepare for a medical career , they went to the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn in 1881 for its junior college program . But `` she had a beau '' – lawyer Henry Livingston Brant – and married them on November 26 , 1885 in Newark , and then focussed on bringing up their family of three children : Clifford , Hazel and Helen . Henry Brant was the heir to their father 's lumber business but studied law at Princeton and then started a successful legal career , with an office on Park Row for over fifty years .
Medical career
In 1898 , when their youngest child was seven , they persuaded their husband to allow them to start medical training . They commuted on the el train to the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women where they studied hard , graduating first in their class in 1903 with honors .
After graduating , they studied electrotherapeutics and light therapy for three years . They later specialized in physical therapy and was the president of the National Society of Therapeutics .
They became Dean of the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women in 1914 . In 1915 , as head of the college , they were asked to comment on the controversial Baby Bollinger case . They spoke against the eugenic ideas of Dr Haiselden , `` In my opinion it is impossible for any physician to say absolutely that any human condition is beyond cure or at least improvement . It is the doctor 's duty to preserve life to the last possible moment . ''
They joined the Cumberland Hospital in 1916 with two other women – the first women to be appointed to the staff of a public hospital in the city .
In 1917 , they served on the American Women 's Hospitals subcommittee of the General Medical Board of the Council of National Defense , for the purpose of mobilizing women for medical service and establishing all-women hospitals overseas .
After the First World War , they continued as a general practitioner in Brooklyn until 1939 .
Personal life and death

In 1935 , they spent three months in South Africa with their husband and members of the Sarasota Woman 's Club . They visited Sarasota in 1936 to give an illustrated lecture to the club about the expedition .
A 309 page biography of their life , Dream Within Them Hand , was published in 1940 . It was written by their daughter , Helen , with classmate and author Alice Ross Colver , who wrote over sixty other books .

The Greenpoint & Williamsburgh Railroad was a streetcar line that operated in and around the City of Brooklyn , in the U.S. state of New York .
The G & WRR was chartered on April 23 , 1864 , under Chapter 323 of the Laws of 1864 , by Mr. Archibald K. Meserole & Associates , as a general railroad . Capitalization was $ 100,000 , and it had an unspecified authorized corporate life . The legislative grant awarded the following route :
From Newtown Creek via Manhattan Avenue , Driggs Avenue , South 8 Street , Kent Avenue , North 4 Street , Driggs Avenue & return , now the northern end of the B43 ( New York City bus ) line .
History
To cement the charter route , a franchise was applied for , which was granted by the City of Brooklyn on February 29 , 1864 .
Archibald Meserole was of a family of local luminaries in the Town of Bushwick , and is remembered today by Meserole Street in Williamsburg and Meserole Avenue in Greenpoint , both relatively minor routes on a citywide scale , but fairly important industrial and residential streets locally . The Kent Avenue portion of the route required trackage rights from the Brooklyn City Railroad , which was grudgingly given , but a snag appeared when the residents on North 4 Street denied permission for the new line . The City averted disaster by amending the franchise on December 16 , 1867 , substituting Grand Street between Kent and Driggs Avenues , along the route of the Grand Street and Newtown Railroad , again requiring a Trackage Rights contract .
Operation
Operation of the railroad started shortly thereafter , so the franchise became secure . In the meantime , Prospect Park became a focal point for the fledgling streetcar lines of Brooklyn City , as did the Village of Hunterspoint just across Newtown Creek in Queens County , and conflict erupted between this railroad and the Nassau Railroad over identical wording of the Nassau road 's franchise and this road 's franchise . Settlement resulted in the consolidation of this road and the Nassau Railroad as the Brooklyn City , Hunterspoint and Prospect Park Railroad on June 30 , 1868 .

Brother Alfred Brousseau , F.S.C . ( February 17 , 1907 – May 31 , 1988 ) , was an educator , photographer and mathematician and was known mostly as a founder of the Fibonacci Association and as an educator .
Biography
Brother Brousseau was born in North Beach , San Francisco , as one of six children . On August 14 , 1920 , Brousseau entered the juniorate of the De La Salle Christian Brothers ( Brothers of the Christian Schools ) , a religious institute of teachers in the Roman Catholic Church . They were accepted into the Christian Brothers novitiate on 31 July 1923 and advanced to the scholasticate on the campus of St. Mary 's College in Moraga , California , in 1924 .
Academic career
In 1926 , while still a college student , Brousseau began teaching at Sacred Heart High School in San Francisco , California . They continued teaching at the secondary level until 1930 when they were assigned to teach at St. Mary 's College while subsequently pursuing a doctorate in physics from the University of California , Berkeley , in 1937 . In 1941 Brousseau was appointed principal of Sacred Heart High School in San Francisco , and later was appointed provincial of the Christian Brothers of the District of California . They returned to St. Mary 's College in 1959 and became chair of the School of Science . Between this period and 1978 , Alfred served both president and treasurer of the Northern Section of the California Mathematics Council and later than president of the entire State Council .
In 1963 , with the American mathematician Verner E. Hoggatt , Brousseau founded the Fibonacci Association with the intention of promoting research into the Fibonacci numbers and related fields . In 1969 Brousseau commented on the Fibonacci Association ( and its associated journal , the Fibonacci Quarterly ) in the April edition of Time magazine , `` We got a group of people together in 1963 , and just like a bunch of nuts , we started a mathematics magazine ... [ People ] tend to find an esthetic satisfaction in it . They think that there 's some kind of mystical connection between these numbers and the universe . ''
Photography
Brousseau was a keen photographer and amassed a collection of in excess of 20,000 color 35 mm transparencies recording the native flora of California .

Nikola Janakiev Karev ( Bulgarian : Никола Янакиев Карев and Macedonian : Никола Јанакиев Карев ; November 23 , 1877 – April 27 , 1905 ) was a Macedonian Bulgarian revolutionary in Ottoman-ruled Macedonia . They were born in Kırşova ( now Kruševo ) and died in the village of Rayçani ( Rajčani ) , both today in North Macedonia . Karev was a local leader of what later became known as the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization ( IMRO ) . They were also a teacher in the Bulgarian school system in their native area , and a member of the Bulgarian Workers ' Social Democratic Party . Today they are considered a hero in Bulgaria and in North Macedonia .
Biography
Early years
Karev completed their early education at the Bulgarian school in Kruševo and in 1893 moved to Sofia , the capital of Principality of Bulgaria , where they worked as a carpenter for the socialist Vasil Glavinov . Karev joined the Socialist group led by Glavinov , and through him , made acquaintance of Dimitar Blagoev and other socialists , and became a member of the Bulgarian Workers ' Social Democratic Party . In 1896 they participated in the Macedonian-Adrianople Social Democratic Group , created as part of the Bulgarian Workers ' Social-Democrat Party . In 1898 Karev went back to Ottoman Macedonia and graduated from the Bulgarian Exarchate 's gymnasium in Bitola . From 1900 they worked as a schoolmaster in the Bulgarian schools in the village of Gorno Divjaci and in their native Kruševo .
Political and revolutionary activity
The first Conference of Macedonian Socialists was held on June 3 , 1900 , near Kruševo , where they defined the core aspects of the potential creation of a separate Macedonian Republic , as a cantonized state , part of a future Balkan Socialist Federation , as a multinational polity offering equal rights to all its citizens . They maintained the slogan `` Macedonia for the Macedonians '' , using Macedonian people as an umbrella term covering Bulgarians , Turks , Greeks , Aromanians , Albanians , Jews , etc. , living in harmony in an independent state . In this period Karev joined the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization and became a leader of a regional armed band ( cheta ) .
On the eve of the Ilinden uprising , in May 1903 , they were interviewed in Bitola by the correspondent of the Greek daily Akropolis Stamatis Stamatiou , who described them as a Bulgarized Macedonian . Per Stamatiou , Karev presented themselves as a voulgarofron , ( i.e . Bulgarophile ) , and replied they were a Macedonian . In response to an ironic question by Stamatiou , Karev also claimed to be a `` direct descendant of Alexander the Great '' . When asked what the revolutionaries wanted for Macedonia , Karev explained their plans to create a republic in the model of Switzerland , providing autonomy and democracy for its different `` races '' . They added that Bulgaria 's expectations to annex the region were miscalculated and that the revolutionaries would accept anyone 's help in order to attain their goal .
During the Ilinden uprising of August 1903 , when Kruševo was captured by the rebels , Karev allegedly authored the so-called Kruševo Manifesto , which called upon the local Muslim population to join forces with the Christians , and became the head of its provisional government . Amongst the various ethno-religious groups ( millets ) in Kruševo a Republican Council was elected with 60 members – 20 representatives from each one : Macedonian Bulgarians ( Exarchists ) , Aromanians and Slav-speaking , Aromanian-speaking and Albanian-speaking Greek Patriarchists . The Council also elected an executive body – the Provisional Government , with six members ( 2 from each mentioned group ) . Though , an ethnic identification problem arose , because Karev called all the members of the local Council `` brother Bulgarians '' , while the IMRO insurgents flew Bulgarian flags , killed several Greek Patriarchists , accused of being Ottoman spies , and subsequently assaulted the local Turk and Albanian Muslims .
Lasting only ten days , the Kruševo Republic was destroyed by Ottoman forces after intense fighting .
After Ilinden
After the uprising Karev went back to Bulgaria and became a political activist of the newly founded Marxist Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers ' Party ( Narrow Socialists ) . However , the Narrows denounced the Ilinden uprising as an adventure inspired by the Bulgarian government , that played into the hands of the Great Powers . In 1904 , Karev made a legal attempt to return to Macedonia , taking advantage of the Bulgarian-Ottoman Amnesty Agreement for the participants in the Ilinden Uprising . They sent several applications for amnesty to Istanbul through the cabinet of the Bulgarian Prime Minister Racho Petrov . The applications were received by the Ottoman Amnesty Commission but remained unanswered , despite the intercession of the Bulgarian diplomatic agent in Istanbul , Grigor Nachovich .
In 1905 Karev was killed during an illegal attempt to enter Ottoman Macedonia from Bulgaria with a group of IMARO fighters .
Family
Their two brothers , Petar and Georgi also participated in IMRO . During the First and the Second World Wars , when Vardar Macedonia was annexed by Bulgaria , they supported the Bulgarian authorities . After World War I , both were abused when the area was returned to Serbian administration . During the Second World War , Georgi was a Mayor of Krusevo . After 1944 they were imprisoned as Bulgarian fascists ' collaborators in Communist Yugoslavia , where both died in the internment camp of Idrizovo in 1950 and 1951 respectively . Nikola 's nephew Mihail , the son of Georgi , was also imprisoned on a charge of `` opposing the idea of Communist Yugoslavia '' .
Controversy over pro-Bulgarian sentiments
After the Second World War the short-lived Kruševo Republic was absorbed into the historical narrative of the new Socialist Republic of Macedonia , as the new Communist authorities eradicated `` pro-Bulgarian '' sentiments . Despite Karev 's Bulgarian national identification , they were an ethnic Macedonian , according to Macedonian historiography . Some Macedonian historians take the view that all Macedonian revolutionaries at that time declared themselves as `` Bulgarians '' , as the designation Macedonian , according to early 20th century ethnic terminology , was still an umbrella term . After 1944 the name of Nikola Karev was present in the anthem of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia : `` Today over Macedonia '' . It was deleted in 1953 without explanation by the communist leadership led by Lazar Koliševski , ostensibly as Nikola and their brothers Petar and Georgi were considered to be `` Bulgarophiles '' .
Legacy
In 2008 , a large bronze equestrian monument of Nikola Karev was placed in front of Parliament Building in Skopje , cast by the Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry of Florence , Italy .

Keyes Gap or Keyes ' Gap is a wind gap in the Blue Ridge Mountain on the border of Loudoun County , Virginia and Jefferson County , West Virginia . The gap is traversed by Virginia State Route 9/West Virginia Route 9 . The Appalachian Trail also crosses the gap .
History
Originally known as Vestal 's Gap , the gap is one of the lowest crossings of the Blue Ridge in Virginia . During the colonial period the main road between Alexandria and Winchester ran through the gap . As such , part of General Edward Braddock 's army under George Washington crossed through the gap on their way to Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War .
By 1820 , the main route west became the newly completed Snickers Gap Turnpike which crossed the Blue Ridge to the south at Snickers Gap , and Keyes Gap lost its prominence . Despite this , Keyes Gap was still of strategic importance during the American Civil War , as it provided an alternate `` back route '' from Virginia to the key point of Harpers Ferry .

Established as a reserve in 1925 , Niokolo-Koba was declared a Senegalese national park on 1 January 1954 . Expanded in 1969 , it was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1981 as a UNESCO-MAB Biosphere Reserve . In 2007 it was added to the UNESCO List of Endangered World Heritage sites .
Since 2005 , the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit .
Geography
The park lies in an upland region through which the upper stretch of the Gambia River flows , towards the northwestern border of Guinea . The Biosphere park itself covers some 9,130 square kilometres , in a great arc running from Upper Casamance/Kolda Region at the Guinea-Bissau border into the Tambacounda Region to within a hundred kilometers of the Guinean border near the southeast corner of Senegal . Its altitude ranges from 16m to as high as 311m .
Flora
Most of the park is woodland savannah and semi-arid Soudanese forest , with large areas of wooded wetlands and seasonal wetlands . The park contains over 1500 species of plants and 78 % of the gallery forest in Senegal .
Many trees and shrubs are covered by lush vegetation along the river stalks , and these vegetation changes according to the terrain and soil . In the valleys and plains , there are vast areas where Vetiveria and herbaceous savannah grow . Overgrown grasslands typically consist of the Paspalum arbiculare and the Echinochloa . Sudanian species grow in the dry forest . There are also areas where bamboo lives .
In valleys and belt-shaped forests , the species reflects the climate of southern Guinea , and the tropical woody liana is very prosperous .
Semiaquatic species live on the riverside , and annual plants disappearing when the height of the water rises are often found on sandy floodplains . At the edge of the pond , dry forests and herbaceous savanna develop depending on the degree of humidity or soil compaction . Sometimes thick bushes called Mimosa pigra occupy the middle of the wetlands .
Fauna
The national park is known for its wildlife . The government of Senegal estimates the park contains 20 species of amphibians , 60 species of fish , 38 species of reptiles ( of which four are tortoises ) . There are some 80 mammal species . These included ( as of 2005 ) an estimated 11000 buffaloes , 6000 hippopotomii , 400 western giant eland , 50 elephants , 120 lions , 150 chimpanzees ( It is inhabited by a banded forest in the park ( Lower Rim ) and Mount Assirik . ( north-western limit line where chimps are distributed . ) ) , 3000 waterbuck ( Kobus ellipsiprymnus ) , 2000 common duiker ( Sylvicapra grimmia ) , an unknown number of red colobus ( Colobus badius rufomitratus ) and a few rare African leopards and West African wild dogs ( Lycaon pictus manguensis ) , although this canid was thought to be wiped out throughout the rest of the country .
Other mammals include roan antelope , Guinea baboon , green monkey , patas monkey , warthog .
Around 330 species of birds have been sighted in the park , notably the Arabian bustard , black crowned crane , Abyssinian ground hornbill ( Bucorvus abyssinicus ) , martial eagle , bateleur ( Terathopius ecaudatus ) , and white-faced duck ( Dendrocygna viduata ) .
There are also reptiles such as three species of crocodiles , four species of tortoises

In enzymology , a formimidoyltetrahydrofolate cyclodeaminase ( ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
5-formimidoyltetrahydrofolate 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate + NH3
Hence , this enzyme has one substrate , 5-formimidoyltetrahydrofolate , and two products , 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and NH3 .
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically ammonia lyases , which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-formimidoyltetrahydrofolate ammonia-lyase ( cyclizing 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate-forming ) . Other names in common use include formiminotetrahydrofolate cyclodeaminase , and 5-formimidoyltetrahydrofolate ammonia-lyase ( cyclizing ) . This enzyme participates in folate metabolism by catabolising histidine and adding to the C1-tetrahydrofolate pool .
In mammals , this enzyme can be found as part of a bifunctional enzyme in a single polypeptide with glutamate formimidoyltransferase ( EC 2.1.2.5 ) , the enzyme activity that catalyses the previous step in the histidine catabolic pathway . This arrangement allows the 5-formimidoyltetrahydrofolate intermediate to move directly from one active site to another without being released into solution , in a process called substrate channeling .
Structural studies
As of late 2007 , 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes , with PDB accession codes , , and .

Protection International ( PI ) is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to the protection of human rights defenders ( HRDs ) . Its stated mission is to enhance the security and the protection of `` threatened civil society actors with non-violent means , especially those who fight for their legitimate rights and for the rights of others as they are guaranteed by the international humanitarian law and the human rights conventions '' .
Protection International began its activities in 1998 as the former European Office of Peace Brigades International ( PBI-BEO ) and is headquartered in Brussels . Working on the principle that `` human rights defenders are one of the main actors fighting against impunity in the name of justice '' , PI runs field projects in several countries ( the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Uganda , Nepal , Thailand , Colombia , Guatemala , Honduras ) and conflict-stricken zones such as the East and Horn of Africa in collaboration with local partner organisations .
It provides human rights defenders ( i.e . trade unionists , journalists , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals defenders , members of anti-corruption organizations , etc . ) with training , knowledge and tools , such as the `` Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders '' , to develop protection measures into their work and enable them `` to defend all human rights '' . Protection International also aims at mobilising the national and international community ( parliaments , governments , the United Nations , the media and public opinion ) .
History
Protection International is the former European Union office of Peace Brigades International ( PBI-BEO ) . In October 2007 , PBI-BEO officially became Protection International , after a separation with the PBI organisation carried out by common consent . Nevertheless , current activities run by Protection International are the logical result of defenders protection initiatives which began more than a decade ago .
In 1998 , it organised a hearing in the Plenary of the European Parliament where human rights defenders from Colombia and Guatemala witnessed . Since then , PI supports the development and implementation of `` new tactics and tools for the protection of HRDs by improving their own security strategies , thus also enabling them to improve their protection of others '' ( victim groups , witnesses , Internally Displaced People communities , women 's HRD 's , LGBTI , among others ) .
From 1999 to 2002 , PI organised public seminars on International Observation Strategies for INGOs and other stakeholders throughout Europe . At the same time , training activities on security and protection of HRD 's were held in more than twenty countries ( among others , Mexico , Guatemala , Colombia , Brazil , Peru , Honduras , Bolivia , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Uganda , Kenya , Ingushetia , Serbia , Indonesia , Nepal , Sri Lanka , India and Thailand ) .
From 2004 onwards , the organisation launched short and long-term activities in Asia , Africa and Latin America . Notably , it opened in 2006 a first # Protection Desks in Nepal , which is a permanent local structure whose objective is to diagnose human rights related threats , train local human rights defenders organisations and monitor their activities . Since then , # Protection Desks have been opened in Colombia , Guatemala , Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
While developing its presence in sensitive areas , PI began working in 2003 with members of Parliaments in various European countries on the adoption of resolutions and motions on the protection of defenders . As a result , PI assisted the Belgian Parliament and Senate in designing and adopting in July 2003 , a global reach resolution which asked the Belgian Government to `` request its diplomatic missions to observe carefully and systematically the situation of human rights defenders in the countries where they 're working. '' . In 2004 , the Bundestag adopted a similar resolution and Spain followed in 2007 by voting its own legislation .
In the last few years , Protection International developed itself quite rapidly . From August 2008 to December 2009 , it delivered trainings about security and protection measures for nearly 1500 HRD in its working countries . Moreover , it provides on a daily basis advice to 600 HRDs and their organisations through its permanent Protection Desks and liaise with international institutions such as the African Commission on Human and People 's Rights ( ACHPR ) and the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders in order to design and implement new protection mechanisms .
In 2009 , PI also issued its first annual report which represents `` years of experience in field protection '' .
Objectives
Broadly speaking , Protection International 's objective is `` to contribute to ensuring fulfilment of national and international obligations for the protection of human rights defenders – people who , individually or together with others , take action to promote or protect human rights '' . Concretely it focuses itself on two goals :
To promote wider knowledge , improved decision-making and increase the effective use of field protection strategies for and by the main stakeholders in protection .
To directly support the work of all stakeholders in the effective use of field protection .
In every activity , Protection Line follows international standards in international human rights law and especially the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders ( 1998 ) , The EU Guidelines on HRD and the UN Guiding Principles for IDPs ( Deng 's principles ) .
While it put the emphasis on the improvement of human rights defenders abilities regarding the handling of security , protection and psychosocial training , both for themselves and the beneficiaries of their work , PI 's Global Protection programme also focuses itself on political action and advocacy , in order that the national and international authorities and other key actors involved in protection issues enforce their obligations in terms of human rights defenders protection .
Protection International 's Work
According to the Annual Report 2008 foreword , Protection International 's role is not `` to replace governments '' in their responsibilities to protect human right 's defenders but well to `` advise defenders on improving their security by following tried-and-tested procedures '' and to complement the work done by other NGOs and international institutions in this field . Therefore , PI covers a wide range of activities :
Protection Capacity Building and Training through analysing the risks faced by HRDs in various contexts , managing their security and transferring knowledge and tools
Protection research : publication of manuals and informations to develop best practices
Advocacy : dissemination of information among key actors in human rights issues , organization of debates and involvement of media , parliaments and trade unions , acting as an alarm to local authorities when they tend to forget their international obligations and commitments on HRDs protection
Video Advocacy : production of testimonies and portraits of HRDS , showing their working environments , work experience ( threats and challenges faced , achievements reached )
Setting-up of Protection Desks that will be used as local centres in collaboration with partner networks and organisations .
Managing www.protectionline.org , a project website providing informations , documents , publications , press releases and promoting urgent actions for the protection of HRD .
Protection Desks
In the last years , Protection International turned its attention to the setting and development of an original and long-term concept : the Protection Desk ( PDs ) . PDs are permanent structures that provide human rights defenders with the know-how and necessary tools to prioritize security and protection issues in their working plans ( i.e . : in a newspaper or a trade union ) and to develop their own security plan based on the trainings given by PI 's trainers on the field . PDs are developed with other human rights organizations active in the targeted country and local partner organizations . The first Protection Desk opened in Nepal in 2006 and worked with `` NGO 's working in conflict regions with ethnic minorities , victims and community committees and on security-sensitivie topics like human trafficking '' . Since then , Protection International grew substantially and opened new PD 's in Uganda , Colombia , Guatemala and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Moreover , the organization is in the preparation of the setting up of a new Protection Desk in Thaïland which should be active in various countries of the region , from Pakistan to Indonesia .
Africa
Democratic Republic of the Congo
In 2004 , Protection International led an observatory mission in DRC and organised two seminars on the EU Guidelines on HRDs . From 2006 until 2007 , it went on with the training of defenders : among the beneficiaries , there were 185 organisations of civil society coming from 13 conflict regions . Along this , Protection International developed regular advocacy activities for an improved protection of HRDs , mainly aimed at European embassies , the MONUC and also national and local stakeholders , especially those involved in the reform of the Congolese Judiciary .
In July 2006 , PI organised a conference with 30 Congolese HRDs , Michael Matthiessen , Javier Solana 's personal representative for human rights and the ACHPR 's Special Rapporteur , Reine Alapini . En 2006 , PI produced `` Les armes de l'impunité '' ( `` The Weapons of Impunity '' ) , a documentary that recounts the assassination of Pascal Kabungulu , a Congolese human rights defender , who worked for the `` Ligue des Droits de l'Homme dans la Région des Grands Lacs '' ( The Human Rights League of the Great Lakes ) and the Protestant NGO `` Héritiers de la Justice '' ( Heirs of Justice ) , and denounces the systematic intimidation or physic violence against the defenders who documented the abuses committed during the Second Congo War .
In May 2009 , Protection International requested a re-trial of the Maheshe Case . Serge Maheshe was a Congolese journalist working for Radio Okapi , the radio supported by the Monuc , who was assassinated in Bukavu in June 2007 . According to Protection International , the trial `` which took place in front of the Military Jurisdictions of Bukavu both at first instance and at appeal , respected neither the norms of a fair and equitable trial nor led to the manifestation of truth . In spite of this , three civilians were sentenced to death in May 2008 '' . The organization recounts the whole observation of the appeal trial in a comprehensive report titled Rapport d'observation du procès d'appel « Maheshe » devant la cour militaire du Sud-Kivu ( R.D . Congo ) et suivi des recours . The work and the call for re-examination and re-trial of Protection International was deemed by the Belgian journalist Colette Braeckman , specialist of the DRC , `` all the more relevant as Didace Namujimbo , another journalist from Bukavu who also worked for the Monuc—which did n't take any civil action for both of its contributors—was assassinated in similar circumstances in 2008 '' .
In August 2009 , after the assassination of Bruno Koko Chirambiza , journalist at the Bukavu private station Radio Star Protection International , along with four other NGO 's ( Action des chrétiens pour l'abolition de la torture , Fédération de l'action des chrétiens pour l'abolition de la torture , Frontline et Diakonie ) , asked the Congolese authorities to put an end to impunity , claiming that `` the situation of journalists and human rights defenders in the DRC is more and more worrying '' .

Charles Louis Busch ( born August 23 , 1954 ) is an American actor , screenwriter , playwright and drag queen , known for their appearances on stage in their own camp style plays and in film and television . They wrote and starred in their early plays Off-off-Broadway beginning in 1978 , generally in drag roles , and also acted in the works of other playwrights . They also wrote for television and began to act in films and on television in the late 1990s . Their best known play is The Tale of the Allergist 's Wife ( 2000 ) , which was a success on Broadway .
Biography
Early life
Busch was born in 1954 and grew up in Hartsdale , New York . They are the Jewish son of Gertrude ( née Young ) and Benjamin Busch . Their father , who wanted to be an opera singer , owned a record store . Their mother died when Busch was seven . They have two older sisters : Meg Busch , who used to be a producer of promotional spots for Showtime , and Betsy Busch , a textile designer . Busch 's aunt , Lillian Blum , their mother 's oldest sister and a former teacher , brought them to live in Manhattan after the death of their mother . Busch was intensely interested in films as a young child , especially those with female leads from the 30s and 40s .
Busch attended The High School of Music and Art in Manhattan . They majored in drama at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois and received their B.A . in 1976 . While at the university , Busch had difficulty being cast in plays and began to write their own material , which succeeded in drawing interest on campus .
Early theatre years
In their plays , Busch usually played the leading lady in drag . They have said , `` Drag is being more , more than you can be . When I first started drag I was n't this shy young man but a powerful woman . It liberated within me a whole vocabulary of expression . It was less a political statement than an aesthetic one . '' Their camp style shows simultaneously send up and celebrate classic film genres .
Busch has said , however , `` I 'm not sure what [ campy ] means , but I guess if my plays have elements of old movies and old fashioned plays , and I 'm this bigger-than-life star lady , that 's certainly campy . I guess what I rebelled against was the notion that campy means something is so tacky or bad that it 's good , and that I just did n't relate to . '' Busch toured the country in a non-drag one-man show they wrote called Alone With a Cast of Thousands from 1978–84 .
By 1984 , Busch 's performance bookings grew slim . They held various odd jobs , such as temporary office assistant , apartment cleaner , portrait artist `` at bar mitzvahs '' , phone salesperson , shop manager , ice cream server , sports handicapper and artists ' model .
They thought perhaps that this last piece would be a skit put on in the Limbo Lounge , a performance space and gallery in the East Village in Manhattan . The skit was a hit and became Vampire Lesbians of Sodom ( 1984 ) .
Busch and their collaborators soon created a series of shows , mostly at the Limbo Lounge , such as Theodora , She-Bitch of Byzantium ( 1984 ) and Times Square Angel ( 1985 , Provincetown Playhouse ) . The company called itself `` Theatre in Limbo '' and attracted a loyal gay following . Other early plays include Pardon My Inquisition , or Kiss the Blood Off My Castanets ( 1986 ) , in which Busch played both Maria Garbanza , a prostitute , and their look-alike , the elegant Marquesa del Drago . and Psycho Beach Party , which ran from July 1987 to May 1988 . Other works include The Lady in Question , which ran from July to December 1989 at the Orpheum Theatre , and Red Scare on Sunset , which ran from June to September 1991 at the Lortel Theatre .
Busch rewrote the book for the musical Ankles Aweigh for a 1988 production staged by the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam , Connecticut .
Their Charles Busch Revue was produced at the Ballroom Theatre in May 1993 in New York . Also in 1993 , they performed in a revival of Jean Genet 's The Maids at the Off-Broadway Classic Stage Company in the role of Solange .
In 1993 , they wrote a novel , Whores of Lost Atlantis , a fictionalized re-telling of the creation of Vampire Lesbians of Sodom . The Green Heart was adapted by Busch from a short story by Jack Ritchie into a musical which was produced by the Manhattan Theater Club at the Variety Arts Theatre in New York City , opening in April 1997 .
They took the male lead in their comedy , You Should Be So Lucky which opened at Primary Stages Company , New York City , in November 1994 .
Other works of the 1990s include Swingtime Canteen , produced at the Blue Angel , New York City , in August 1995 . Their one-man show , Flipping My Wig ran at the WPA Theater , New York City , starting in December 1996 .
They wrote Queen Amarantha , which played at the WPA Theatre , starting in October 1997 . Their play Die , Mommie , Die ! was first performed in Los Angeles , opening in July 1999 at the Coast Playhouse .
Film and television
Busch 's early film appearances include Ms. Ellen , a fortune teller in drag in Trouble on the Corner ( 1997 ) . Busch has twice appeared in film versions of their own plays : Die , Mommie , Die ! ( 1999 ) and the comedy horror Psycho Beach Party ( 2000 ) . They co-wrote , starred in and directed the film A Very Serious Person ( 2006 ) , which starred Polly Bergen and received an honorable mention at the Tribeca Film Festival . In 2020 , Busch co-wrote , co-directed , and starred in the film , The Sixth Reel ( 2021 ) .
Busch had a recurring role in the HBO series Oz from 1999–2000 ( the third and fourth seasons ) as Nat Ginzburg , an `` effeminate but makeup-free inmate on death row , certainly a departure from their usual glamour girl roles . '' They wrote television sitcom pilots and movie treatments as a source of extra income while they were a cult performer . They sold three pilots to CBS that were not produced .
Stage work , 2000s
Busch 's work debuted on Broadway in October 2000 , when The Tale of the Allergist 's Wife opened , following an Off-Broadway run in February through April 2000 . The play , their first in which they did not star , and the first created for a mainstream audience , was written for actor Linda Lavin , who played opposite Michele Lee and Tony Roberts . Allergist 's Wife received a 2001 nomination for Tony Award for Best Play and ran for 777 performances . Their other Broadway work was rewriting the book for Boy George 's short-lived autobiographical musical Taboo . Since 2000 , Busch has performed an annual one-night staged reading of their 1984 Christmas play Times Square Angel . In January 2003 , they headlined a revival of their 1999 play Shanghai Moon , costarring BD Wong , at the Drama Dept , Greenwich House Theatre , New York City .
They have taken the eponymous lead in three productions of Auntie Mame : a staged reading in 1998 ; a benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS in 2003 ; and a small-scale summer touring production in 2004 .
Our Leading Lady , Busch 's play about Laura Keene , was produced by the Manhattan Theater Club at the City Center Stage II Theatre , in 2007 , and starred Kate Mulgrew . Their play , The Third Story , premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse in September 2008 with Mary Beth Peil as Peg , and was then produced in New York by MCC Theatre at the Lucille Lortel Theatre , starring Busch and Kathleen Turner ( Peg ) , opening in February 2009 . Busch wrote and starred in a play , The Divine Sister , a satirical take on Hollywood films about religion , including Doubt and the Sound of Music . It ran at the SoHo Playhouse in New York City , opening in September 2010 . In 2013 , Busch wrote and starred as Jimmy in the Primary Stages production of The Tribute Artist . In March 2019 , Busch starred as Lucille Ball in I Loved Lucy by playwright Lee Tannen at the Bridge Street Theatre in Catskill , New York .
Performance style and influences
Busch 's style is based on movie star acting rather than naturalistic femininity . Busch later said that they were described as `` too thin , too light , which is the euphemism for gay . I was never cast at Northwestern for basically these reasons , and finally , I thought maybe what 's most disturbing about me is what is most unique : my theatrical sense , my androgyny , even identifying with old movie actores '' . They specialize in femmes fatales . `` I 'm an actor playing a role , but it 's drag . A lot of drag can be very offensive , but I like to think that in some crazy way the women I play are feminist heros . ''
Busch said , `` I 've always played a duality . I guess I 've always felt a duality in myself : elegance and vulgarity . There 's humor in that . I 've always found that fun on stage , as well . It 's not enough for me to be the whore . I have to be the whore with pretensions or the great lady with a vulgar streak . It 's the duality that I find interesting . '' Busch generally writes without a political agenda , and they predominantly portray characters who are white , middle class , gay , and between 20 and 40 years old .
Busch was inspired by Charles Ludlam , an avant-garde performer and playwright who founded The Ridiculous Theatrical Company in 1967 and wrote , directed , and acted in the company 's exaggerated , absurdist camp productions . Busch presented their one-man show Hollywood Confidential in a theater owned by The Ridiculous Theatrical Company in July 1978 at One Sheridan Square , New York . They also appeared for several performances in the company 's production of Bluebeard as Hecate , also in July 1978 . Busch said of this experience : `` If I had ever entertained a fantasy of working with the Ridiculous Theatrical Company , doing Hecate got it out of my system . '' Busch has said that they were also inspired by seeing Joan Sutherland and Zoe Caldwell perform when they were a child . Busch recalled : `` When I was about 13 years old , around 1968 or '69 , I went to see Zoe Caldwell in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie . I was so dazzled that I do n't think I 've ever recovered . '' In 1991 , Busch was performing in their play Red Scare on Sunset . They said that they had difficulty connecting with the audience at one of the performances . Caldwell went backstage after the performance to give them some advice : `` 'You are so beautiful . But you were pushing too hard . You 're much better than that . ' ... It 's the best lesson I 've learned from a famous person . '' During their run in The Tribute Artist , Busch revealed that they also found inspiration in drag performers Charles Pierce and Lynne Carter .
Personal life
Busch 's memoir , Leading Lady , is set to be published by BenBella Books in 2023 .
Awards and nominations
Busch received the Charlie Local and National Comedy Award from the Association of Comedy Artists in 1985 for `` special contributions to the art of comedy . '' They also received the Manhattan Academy of Cabaret Award in 1985 and 1993 .
In 2003 , they won the Best Performance Award at the Sundance Film Festival for their performance in the film Die Mommie Die ! .
They have been honored with a star on the Playwright 's Walk of Fame outside the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York City and the Legend Award by the Off-Broadway League of Theatres . They were awarded the Gingold Theatrical Group Golden Shamrock award in 2014 .

Eurhinus magnificus , the jewel weevil , is a species of weevil native to South America . The species was originally described by Leonard Gyllenhaal in 1836 .
Description
Eurhinus magnificus is brilliantly coloured . Adults are approximately 5-6 mm long and 3-4 mm wide . Its host plant is Cissus verticillata .
Range
Early descriptions from 1909 indicate that Eurhinus magnificus does not extend south of Nicaragua , however observations aggregated in GBIF suggest that the species moved more south towards Panama . According to the same records , the species has also been observed in Florida . The species might have been introduced to Florida through banana shipments from Costa Rica .

VH-2 ( Rescue Squadron 2 ) was one of six dedicated ( VH ) Rescue Squadrons of the U.S. Navy during World War II . A more comprehensive write-up on the VH squadrons can be found in the history of Rescue Squadron 3 ( VH-3 ) , which was the US Navy 's most active VH squadron . VH-2 was established in August 1944 and disestablished in November 1945 . Unlike the other VH squadrons , VH-2 mostly employed the PB2B Catalina during its wartime operations . Late in the war , the PB2B Catalina was no longer used for open sea rescues , since it had proven less rugged in the open sea than its successor the Martin PBM Mariner . Thus VH-2 's primary mission was to `` spot '' survivors in the water and direct other craft to the site to effect the rescue . On at least two occasions , VH-2 did effect rescues with open sea landings . VH-2 was credited with the initial spotting , direct rescue , or assistance in the rescue of 96 downed bomber crewmen . After the war , they were assigned the Martin PBM Mariner .
Operational history
August 1944 : VH-2 was established at NAS San Diego , California ..
February 1945 : VH-2 commenced rescue operations from Tanapag Harbor in Saipan in support of the Invasion of Iwo Jima and B-29 strikes against Japan .
28 February 1945 : Two VH-2 planes were deployed to Iwo Jima , operating from the USS Chincoteague ( AVP-24 ) .
March – June 1945 : VH-2 conducted 190 search , standby and spotting missions . VH-2 was credited with the initial siting of 30 survivors . VH-2 made an open sea landing to directly rescue one other ( by Lt DePrato ) . VH-2 was also credited with assisting in the rescue of 54 additional survivors .
8 July 1945 : VH-2 located an outrigger with three `` survivors '' on board who appeared disinterested and unfriendly . The USS Austin ( DE-15 ) was dispatched to the scene and warned by the still circling VH-2 plane about the unusual behavior of the `` survivors '' . The `` survivors '' revealed themselves as Japanese on a suicide mission when they threw a hand-grenade onto the deck of the ship . The destroyer opened fire and no prisoners were taken .
27 July 1945 : A PB2B Catalina from VH-2 on a Dumbo standby mission crashed in the Philippine Sea 100 miles west of Alamagan killing seven crew members and seriously injuring three .
July – September 1945 : VH-2 conducted 116 missions in support of B-29 strikes against Japan , prisoner-of-war missions to Japan , and `` ferry movement '' of aircraft after the war . VH-2 spotted eleven survivors of a downed B-29 crew , rescuing six of them in an open sea landing . The other five were picked up by a surface vessel .
27 August 1945 : The original VH-2 squadron was relieved `` en masse '' with six PBM-5 planes and nine new crews .
21 October 1945 : VH-2 left Saipan and departed for NAS Alameda .
November 1945 : VH-2 was disestablished .

`` Over the Edge '' is a song by American electronic producer Hayden Capuozzo and English UK hardcore producer Matthew Lee , featuring American singer-songwriter August Hausman . Canadian record label Monstercat released it on August 11 , 2017 . The song was featured on the compilation album Monstercat Uncaged Vol . 2 , released August 25 , 2017 .
Background and release
In early 2017 , Capuozzo had received an a cappella song sent by Hausman , though Capuozzo had not started on any production using the a cappella as they decided to instead finish up other projects . During Flux Pavilion 's Around The World in 80 Raves tour , Capuozzo started production on `` Over the Edge '' using Hausman 's original a cappella . They later contacted Lee to propose a collaboration between the two as the song would be divergent compared to both producers past work . In an interview with Billboard , Capuozzo commented on the production process of the song , saying `` It had a vibe that would be great for us to try something a bit outside the box '' , further stating `` we always make crazy fast paced stuff , so I figured we could try something really new for the both of us . ''
`` Over the Edge '' was featured on Monstercat 's thirty-second compilation album titled Monstercat Uncaged Vol . 2 released on August 25 , 2017 . It was the second track on the album , which also includes 29 songs by various artists and two albums mixes .
Critical reception
`` Over the Edge '' received generally mixed to positive reviews . Lauren Ikenn of This Song Slaps wrote that the song was `` bound to be a hit '' , further stating that the song `` is the ultimate house track , complete with a hard-hitting beat , a catchy drop and AU8UST 's pop-infused vocals . '' Billboard 's David Rishty wrote that the two producers had `` flipped the script and dropped a bouncy house cut '' , describing the song as `` buoyant '' and `` sprinkled with high-pitched vocal chops . '' Marcus of EDM Sauce described the songs drop as anime-like , further writing that `` these dudes have us completely fooled . It 's a pretty damn cool song for that reason . If you know these guys , you know that this drop is the last thing you would expect from them especially after hearing the hard build . '' Writing for Trapstyle , Ali Mooney noted that the song is `` very different from their previous track '' , later describing the song as having a `` mellow house feel , to it mixed with melodic , electronic sounds . '' Noiseporn 's Lennon Cihak wrote `` Kayzo and Gammer have most definitely stepped away from their typical fast-paced hardcore music and have focused their efforts in a production that truly complements AU8UST 's pop vocals '' Writing for EDMTunes , Aly Galito noted the two producers sway from their typical style , writing `` the song includes a different feel away from trap and dubstep as it incorporates a mixture of a pop and house '' , later stating `` it 's refreshing to hear new and catchy sounds like this .

Funding
The Mumbai Marathi Grantha Sangrahalaya is funded by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) and the State Government of Maharashtra . In 2019-20 , it received funding of ₹19.68 lakh from BMC and ₹34.00 lakh from the state government . In October 2019 , HT reported that one of the major problems for the library is the pittance funding it gets from BMS and the state government .
Of the 29 branches of the Mumbai Marathi Grantha Sangrahalaya , 4 are located in Pune and the rest is in Mumbai . Fourteen of these receive approx Rs 1 lakh each from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation , But the Maharashtra government contributes even less to each library .
Trustee

Pawar won as president in the election held in October 2021 , defeating their opponent , Dhananjay Shinde , the general secretary of Aam Aadmi Party 's Maharashtra state unit .
Suresh Prabhu , Bhalchandra Mungekar , Arvind Sawant , Vidya Chavan and Shashi Prabhu are serving as the chairpersons of the library trust .

The larvae feed on Quercus douglasii , Quercus dumosa , Quercus durata and Quercus × alvordiana . They mine the leaves of their host plant . The mine is ovoid . The epidermis is opaque , brown . All mines cross the midrib and consume 60 % -90 % of the leaf surface . The mines are solitary and normally with two folds , but rarely one . These folds are not necessarily parallel to each other . The leaf is bowed up with a sunken area at the middle of leaf .
Etymology

The First Congregational Parsonage is a former clergy house in Wabasha , Minnesota , United States . It was built in 1872 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for being one of the city 's finest examples of a frame Italianate building . However , in 1987 it was moved from its original location at 305 Second Street West due to construction of the Wabasha–Nelson Bridge . Removed from its historic context in a riverfront residential district , the parsonage was delisted from the National Register in 1992 .
Description
The First Congregational Parsonage is a two-story frame building with a front wing and a slightly smaller rear wing . The cubiform front wing measures while the rear section measures . The building has a low-pitched hip roof whose eaves are supported by evenly spaced brackets . Both sections have clapboard siding with corner boards .
The main wing has sash windows set in segmental arch wood surrounds with infill at the tops of the arches . The main entry is offset on the front façade , balanced by paired windows on the first and second floor . This doorway has a clear glass transom window . The main entrance originally had a decorative open porch , which was later replaced by a simpler porch with a hip roof and plain columns . What was originally the east side elevation has a cantilevered bay with a bracketed cornice on the first floor and a paired sash window on the second . The windows of the rear section are double-hung in simple wood frames .
History
The First Congregational Parsonage was built in 1872 to house clergy for the adjacent Congregational Church of Wabasha . The congregation had been organized in February 1856 , making it Wabasha 's second-oldest religious group , and the church had been built in 1866 . The parsonage 's first occupant was Reverend C. K. Honeyman .
The building served as clergy housing until 1955 , when it became a secular private home . The church officially sold the property in 1959 , and it went through a succession of owners over the next two decades . In 1979 new owners Dr. Jay and Warya Greenberg had the interior remodeled to serve as a chiropractic clinic . It continued to serve in that function for the next seven years .
In 1986 the Minnesota Department of Transportation was building a new bridge to carry Minnesota State Highway 60 over the Mississippi River into Nelson , Wisconsin , and the First Congregational Parsonage was on property needed to build the bridge approach . The Department of Transportation worked with the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office to move the historic building to a new site within Wabasha . The house was moved the following year to 100 Coulee Way .
In its new location it became a bed and breakfast known as the Cottonwood Inn . It was so named because it was adjacent to one of the largest cottonwood trees in Wabasha County .

Conor Clune ( Irish name Conchobhair Mac Clúin ; 26 July 1893 – 21 November 1920 ) was one of three men along with Dick McKee and Peadar Clancy killed in controversial circumstances in Dublin Castle on Bloody Sunday , 1920 , a day that also saw the killing of a network of British intelligence agents by the `` Squad '' unit of the Irish Republican Army and the killing of 14 people in Croke Park by the Royal Irish Constabulary . Clune was 27 years old .
Early life
Clune was born as Cornelius Clune in the village of Quin , County Clare on 26 July 1893 the son of John Clune , a carpenter , and Bridget Walsh of Kilkishen . Clune was one of a family of seven boys and three girls . They were educated at the local National School and St. Flannan 's College , Ennis . A Gaelic League enthusiast , they also spent some time at Ring Irish College , Colaiste na Rinne , County Waterford . From a young age they were active in Gaelic League circles , and spoke Irish on every occasion possible .
Involvement in nationalist organisations
Clune was at one time a member of the National Volunteers , the military organisation led by John Redmond that resulted from the 1914 split in the Irish Volunteers . They do not appear to have been a member of the Irish Volunteers , although the commemorative plaque in Dublin Castle refers to them as `` Volunteer Conor Clune '' ( see picture ) . However , they were devoted to the Irish language and was involved with the Gaelic League .
Edward MacLysaght
Following a period during which they worked in Dublin , they applied for and was appointed Manager at the seed and plant nursery owned by Edward MacLysaght at Raheen , Tuamgraney , about ten miles from Quin . It was with MacLysaght that they travelled to Dublin on the morning of Saturday , 20 November 1920 , bringing with them the books of the Raheen Co-op for its annual audit .
Vaughan 's Hotel
They arrived in Dublin that Saturday evening . Clune told Mr. MacLysaght that they were to meet an Irish language enthusiast , John O'Connell . While there , Clune met Piaras Béaslaí , a member of Dáil Éireann , Director of Publicity and then Editor of An t-Óglach . They parted company , after arranging to meet on the following day .
Also on Saturday evening , Peadar Clancy , along with members of the GHQ staff of the Irish Republican Army , met at 35 Lower Gardiner Street , Dublin . The meeting was called to discuss the final arrangements for what would be the route of the British secret service , with the elimination of the Cairo Gang the following morning . Having concluded their business , the meeting dispersed , Michael Collins , Clancy , McKee and some of the others went to Vaughan 's Hotel ( present-day Parnell Square ) , then the rendezvous for many of the leaders of the IRA .
It was at this time that Clune , accompanied by Seán O'Connell , went to Vaughan 's . Beaslaí was upstairs with Brigadier Dick McKee , Michael Collins , Peadar Clancy when word was brought to Beaslaí that Conor Clune from Clare was there to meet him .
While in the hotel , the porter , Christy Harte , became suspicious of one of the guests , a Mr Edwards , who had made a late-night telephone call , and then left the hotel . Harte informed the Volunteers , who quickly left the building . Beaslaí , who was familiar with the Hotel 's surroundings escaped with the other senior volunteers including Michael Collins .
Clune was arrested in the raid which soon followed by British Auxiliaries . Clune was the only one arrested at Vaughan 's that night as they were not registered as a guest . This , according to Seán Kavanagh , a member of the `` Squad '' , would ultimately cost them their life . Clancy and McKee would also be arrested in the early hours of the morning in another part of the city , though the Cairo Gang assassination plan was already in motion , for the next day .
Dublin Castle
Having been arrested , the three men were taken to the old detective office in the Exchange Court . According to T. Ryle Dwyer , the room was being used as a kind of guardroom , and was furnished with some beds , tables and some stores , which included a box of hand grenades Brigadier General Ormonde Winter , head of the British Secret Service in Ireland and two Auxiliary Division officers , Captain Hardy and Captain King , were the British personnel who interrogated Clune , Clancy , and McKee .
A republican prisoner , V J . Young , in custody at the time in the Castle is certain that Clune was killed in error for Seán Fitzpatrick , the man arrested with McKee and Clancy at Fitzpatrick 's home in Gloucester Street . Clune and Fitzpatrick they say were of similar build and both were wearing brown suits . Young overheard two Auxiliary officers disputing the identity of one of the prisoners . One said , `` That 's him '' while another said '' no , its him '' as they looked at just Fitzpatrick and Clune .
According to T. Ryle Dwyer , the prisoners `` supposedly '' got hold of the hand grenades and threw them . One of the sentries testified that themselves and a colleague heard a noise behind them and noticed that two of the prisoners had thrown the grenades at them . They dived for cover behind some mattresses , but the grenades did not detonate . One of the prisoners was also said to have got hold of a rifle according to one of the guards , which they levelled and fired at the guard commander as they entered the room , but missed . The prisoner then turned the rifle and fired another shot at another guard . The guard said they then fired at the prisoner , and the prisoner dropped , and that the guard commander also fired at the prisoner .
The guard commander said , on hearing a noise , entered the room , and `` the prisoner McKee fired at me '' , and that McKee then turned and fired at the sentry . The guard commander also claimed to have dropped McKee . They then said they saw Clancy with a shovel , and that Clancy was attempting to strike another guard . One of the guards ( who had dived behind the mattresses ) then fired at Clancy and they fell .
A fourth witness was to tell much the same story .
According to author Seán O'Mahony , the three were tortured in the guardroom to extort from them the names of the volunteers who had earlier that morning shot dead most of the `` Cairo Gang '' . Refusing to talk , they were `` subsequently murdered '' on the evening of 21 November 1920 .
The condition of their bodies when returned by the British authorities to their families supports this assertion . There were extensive signs of discolouring . A military doctor claimed that large staining could occur , and this would depend on the way the bodies had been lying . They also said that Clancy had been hit with up to five bullets , which made eight wounds ; Dick McKee had three wounds caused by two bullets . They said McKee had no bayonet wounds , but there was a bullet lodged underneath their skin on the right of their chest . Clune , they said , had nine wounds caused by seven bullets . T. Ryle Dwyer also states that David Neligan was adamant that they had not been bayoneted .
Their employer Edward McLysaght took charge of the body when the authorities released it . They had the body medically examined . The examination proved that Clune was shot 13 times in the chest . Clune 's body was brought home to Co. Clare for burial . Their coffin was draped with the Irish flag , but when a British officer objected to it , Canon Slattery , the presiding priest , complied and removed it . They are buried in Quin Abbey near their ancestors . A book titled Death in the Castle : Three murders in Dublin Castle 1920 , written by Sean O'Mahony , and published by 1916–1921 Club records both the life and deaths of the three Republicans .
There is a road in Dublin , close to the Phoenix Park called Conor Clune Road and another called Clune Road in Finglas .

John A. Poindexter ( October 12 , 1825 – April 14 , 1869 ) was a colonel in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War . They and Joseph C. Porter were the primary recruiting commanders in northern Missouri during 1862 .
Early life and career
Poindexter was born in Montgomery County , Kentucky , to David and Elizabeth ( Watts ) Poindexter . They married in Kentucky to Melissa Lucas , who died a few years after the birth of their daughter Mary E. Poindexter ( 1849-1935 ) . They married again in 1857 to Martha K. `` Mattie '' Hayes ( b. about 1840 ) . The 1860 census lists them as a prosperous merchant in Scott County , Kentucky .
Descendants
Following the war , their sons Thomas A. Poindexter ( 1867–1936 ) and Smith A. Poindexter ( 1868–1953 ) were born . Following their death on 14 April 1869 , their daughter Mary E. Poindexter married on 12 September 1869 to Andrew J. Hayes ( Sep 1846 - 22 Sep 1931 ) , son of Samuel A. Hayes and Jane W. Cloyd .
Civil War
Living in Missouri when the Civil War , Poindexter was commissioned in June 1861 as captain of Company A , 1st Cavalry Regiment , 3rd Division of the Missouri State Guard . They and their men stopped a train in August , seizing federal money . They served at the Siege of Lexington in command of several independent companies . Following the battle they were elected colonel of the 5th Infantry Regiment , Third Division of the Missouri State Guard on September 24 , 1861 . While recruiting in Howard County , Missouri , Poindexter and their regiment were surprised and defeated on January 7 , 1862 , at the Battle of Roan 's Tan Yard , scattering their command .
Poindexter commanded of a consolidated remnant of the 4th and 5th Cavalry regiments of the Missouri State Guard at the Battle of Pea Ridge , where they were slightly wounded . Following the Confederate defeat , Poindexter resumed recruiting in North Missouri , while Porter recruited in Northeastern Missouri . Poindexter gained recruits , but thereafter was not very successful . After Odon Guitar struck a blow against Porter at Moore 's Mill , they turned their attention to Poindexter . In August , Guitar 's forces overran and completely scattered Poindexter 's green recruits at the Battle of Compton 's Ferry and a subsequent fight at the Battle of Yellow Creek . Seriously wounded , Poindexter was captured on September 1 . They would never again serve the Confederacy .
Post-capture and death
Following their capture , Poindexter was held while Union authorities considered trying and executing them as a guerrilla either by military tribunal or in a civilian court .
SAINT LOUIS , MO. , September 9 , 1862 .
Brig . Gen. LEWIS MERRILL :
I think Poindexter had better be tried by military commission . I believe I can secure the execution of a sentence .
J. M. SCHOFIELD ,
Brigadier-General .
Trans-Mississippi commander Thomas C. Hindman attempted to intervene pointing out that Poindexter was a CSA officer . James Totten replied :
I understand the facts to be that when arrested they were in citizen 's garb , at a private house , and within our lines . If so , they are by the laws of war a spy and should be treated accordingly .
However , Poindexter eventually publicly disavowed guerrilla warfare and was paroled to their home for the remainder of the war under a bond of $ 10,000 .
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI ,
Saint Louis , Mo. , June 15 , 1864 .
General FISK ,
Saint Joseph , Mo . :
I have seen Poindexter , of Randolph , who is under bonds , and written them a note to use their influence in favor of law and order among the rebel sympathizers . Keep the secret and give needful orders to secure them from molestation or outrage . They will do good .
W. S. ROSECRANS ,
Major-General .
During August , 1864 , Poindexter was forced to leave their home fearing both the wrath of Unionists who considered them a bushwacker and Southern sympathizers who considered them a traitor . They sought the protection of Union authorities from both threats .
Their health never recovered from their earlier wounds and imprisonment and they died April 14 , 1869 . They are interred at Antioch Cemetery near Moberly , Missouri .

Aggrey Zola Klaaste ( 6 January 1940 – 19 June 2004 ) was a South African newspaper journalist and editor . They were best known for being editor of the Soweto-based newspaper , the Sowetan , from 1988 to 2002 . They introduced the concept of `` nation building '' while editor of the Sowetan and spent much of their time and energy promoting the idea .
Early life
Klaaste was born in Kimberley as one of eight children , in a township called Green Point in the Northern Cape . Their father Tobias Klaaste was born in 1886 and died in 1973 . Their mother Regina Mantoa was born in 1900 and died in 1986 . When they were three , their family moved to Sophiatown in Johannesburg , where their father became a clerk at a gold mine . Klaaste attended school in Newclare ( previously known as Western Native Township ) , before moving onto Western High School , a predimoninatly coloured area at the time .
In 1955 , when Sophiatown was dismantled , the family moved to Meadowlands in Soweto . They began studying at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1958 and graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts degree . Klaaste was one of the last blacks to have completed a degree at the university before it was closed to blacks by apartheid laws . In 1960 the apartheid government passed a law called the Extension of University Education Act , which meant some of the best universities in South Africa were reserved for the white minority . Klaaste attended WITS with South African literary luminaries like Miriam Tlali , the first black woman in South Africa to publish a novel in English .
Career
After graduating they became a journalist , first with Drum magazine and subsequently with The World ( which was banned by the South African government in 1977 ) and The Post ( which became the Sowetan in 1981 ) . While working as an intern for Drum magazine , who 's celebrated writers had by this time moved on to different things , Klaaste 's lifestyle emulated that of their predecessors . They soon battled with alcoholism . In 1961 they took on a permanent job as a writer for Bantu World . Due to heavy drinking , they struggled to hold on to permanent work for too long . They found themselves back at Drum in 1964 , where they covered the famous Rivonia Trial . In 1977 they were arrested along with The World editor at the time , Percy Qoboza , and spent nine months in jail . This was a crack down led by the Special Branch police in an effort to shut down two of the most popular black publications at the time , The World and Weekend World .
Nation Building
In the late 1980s South Africa was a bedrock for mass protest action met with violence from the apartheid police . By 1988 Aggrey Klaaste was the editor of The Sowetan ( previously The World ) which was the largest circulating black newspaper in the country at the time . The ANC accused The Sowetan of showing preferential treatment and being pro-PAC and Black Consciousness . With these two factors to consider , Klaaste decided to shift the newspaper 's editorial policy and began sparking a dialogue around nation building . They wrote at length in their column On the Line about a non-racial South Africa and practical measures with which black people can make sense of apartheid on a daily basis . Klaaste was also known to be an active member of their community in Meadowlands , Soweto . Klaaste faced more criticism for their attempts at unifying a divided country , particularly from the Black Consciousness Movement , who accused them of ‘ selling-out ' by spreading ideas of a non-racial society .
Prior to their death , they were an executive with the black empowerment company , New Africa Investment Ltd. ( NAIL ) as well as the chairperson of the Johannesburg Tourism Company . They were voted 58th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004 .

The Bombardier BiLevel Coach is a bilevel passenger railcar currently built by Alstom and previously by Bombardier , Hawker Siddeley Canada , the Canadian Car and Foundry ( Can Car ) , and the UTDC . Used by North American commuter rail operators , they hold 360 passengers and feature a distinctive octagonal profile .
History
The BiLevel coaches were designed by Toronto 's regional commuter rail service , GO Transit and Hawker Siddeley Canada in the mid-1970s as a more efficient replacement for GO 's original single-deck coaches and cab cars . Later coaches were manufactured by Urban Transportation Development Corporation/Can-Car and , most recently , Bombardier . Alstom purchased Bombardier in 2021 and now owns the designs and manufacturing facility . There are more than one thousand three hundred BiLevel coaches in service today , all of which have been built in Thunder Bay , Ontario .
Construction
BiLevel coaches have an aluminum body on a steel frame . They are high , wide , and weigh about . They hold 136–162 seated passengers and 276 standees ( depending on model and seat configuration ) and have two pairs of doors on each side Some of the newer coaches have electrical outlets for laptop computers and other devices along with small tables .
All newly built coaches have a washroom on the lower level ; the original coaches for GO Transit have the washroom on the intermediate level in the same location as where the cab is located in cab cars . These coaches also featured a water fountain , which is now removed . The washrooms feature a stainless-steel chemical flush toilet , sink , mirrors , waste receptacles , and occupancy lamps . The washroom is accessible , featuring wide doors and grab bars .
One major variant is the cab car . In 2014 , Metrolinx ( the provincial agency operating GO Transit ) and Bombardier announced a new cab car design , which included a larger cab end and crash-energy management crumple zones . The new cab car has been purchased by Sounder Commuter Rail , Altamont Corridor Express , and COASTER .
BiLevel coaches have 480 V head end power ( HEP ) systems except those for GO Transit , which have 575 V HEP systems . ( The 575 V HEP system is a Canadian standard , having been previously used by CN for their Tempo cars . ) A 575 V HEP power unit is supplied with GO coaches leased to other operators and GO leases locomotives with 480 V HEP when they lease coaches from other agencies .
Comparison with other Bombardier bilevel coaches
Bombardier also produces two other bilevel railway coach models , the MultiLevel and the Double-deck Coach . The MultiLevel conforms to a smaller loading gauge than the BiLevel for the tighter clearances found on the Washington , D.C.–Boston Northeast Corridor and the Mont Royal Tunnel used by Exo in Montréal . It has doors on the middle level rather than the lower level in order to serve the high-level platforms in those two regions . The Double-deck Coach is designed , built and operated in Germany ; it conforms to the German loading gauge and features a cross-sectional profile that narrows towards the upper level .

Louis Vincent Aronson ( December 25 , 1869 – November 3 , 1940 ) , inventor and business person , founded The Art Metal Works , which evolved to manufacture the Ronson lighters .
Biography
Louis Vincent Aronson was an American inventor , industrialist and philanthropist who is best remembered as the inventor of Ronson lighters . `` He was a son of Simon and Jennie Aronson , who were natives of Prussia . They were born December 25 , 1869 , in New York City , and there their boyhood was spent . ''
“ As a Christmas present , ” they said in later years , `` “ I always felt I ought to qualify by making the world happier . If I have done so , even in the slightest degree , I am so much the happier myself because I had the luck to be born on Christmas Day . My parents used to tell me that a Christmas Child should carry the Christmas spirit with them all the year , no matter what their religious faith might be . ''
Early life and education
Aronson was an exceptionally gifted young man who graduated from public school at the age of 12 before entering a New York Technical School specializing in metallurgy , practical metal working and mechanical drawing . At the same time , they set up a laboratory in the basement of their parents ' home where they experimented with plating processes and turned out money-making items while they devised ways of metalizing common items , in a durable finish of matte gold , including flowers , butterflies , animal claws and baby shoes .
Aronson natural ability for designing was honed at the technical school and served them well throughout their life . They excelled and completed the School 's four year academic program in three years . When they graduated in 1886 , at the age of 16 , they were qualified as an Expert Metallurgist , Draftsman and Designer , they also had a high level knowledge of Chemistry . They returned to the school five years later as an instructor in metallurgy for several years before devoting all their time to their own company . When they were 24 years old , they sold the rights to a commercially valuable metal plating process according to Urban Cummings book Ronson , The World 's The Greatest Lighters , Wick Lighters 1913–2000 . While retaining full use of their invention , young Aronson sold the patent rights for $ 5000 and used the proceeds to open their own company named the Art Metal Works .
CareerLouis V. Aronson gained public recognition when they won an award in 1893 from the Belgian government for the creation of the first non-toxic match , and young business person Aronson received 50,000 Francs , equaling $ 10,000 in U.S. dollars . In 1897 they received a U.S. patent ( 592,227 ) for a match design ( called the Wind-match ) that would light in windy conditions or when wet . They continued working on their match designs including inventing the “ Birds Eye ” or “ Kitchen ” match that had a dual-tip design in 1903 ; this was an important safety improvement because friction matches of the day would sometimes light accidentally especially when stepped on or while in one 's pocket . They realized that placing a small friction ignition chemical on the tip instead of the entire match-head greatly limited accidental ignition . This style of match is still in use today .
Aronson continued their research on all-weather matches finally receiving U.S. patent ( 1,287,819 ) in 1918 , for a match that was praised by soldiers who were fighting in mud-filled trenches during World War I . Their proficiency with matches led to a U.S. patent ( 1,295,952 ) for Bomb fuses also used in World War I , which they donated to the U.S. Government for the duration of the war , later earning their company the prestigious Distinguished Service Certificate from President Woodrow Wilson and the War Department . Through their research on matches , they sought to create and refine igniting devices that were efficient , safe and commercially viable .
By the year 1910 they received their first patent for a pocket lighter ( U.S. Pat . 965,149 ) . Their pocket lighter used flint material which contained a mixture of cerium and iron according to the patent . Their design was a simple device that created a shower of sparks with the press of a finger - but there was no sustainable flame . Based on the patent dates , this device preceded the Pist-O-Liter ( U.S. Pat . 966,153 ) which they successfully produced that year , but likewise , it only produced sparks . Within three years they received a patent titled Pyrophorous Lighter , ( U.S. Pat . 1,084,386 ) which we now appreciate as the Paragon striker lighter , a simple device capable of producing and sustaining a flame by means of a steel-tipped wand fitted with a cloth-wick saturated in petroleum ether also known as Benzine or Naphtha . The following year , 1914 , they were granted a design patent for the well known Bulldog striker lighter ( Des . Pat . D 45,407 ) which utilized the same principles as the Paragon , and soon became a very popular table lighter .
Aronson 's earlier efforts to produce igniting devices led them to invent many other useful and profitable items too . Their ongoing experiments sparked ideas for other successful inventions like safe children 's toys including sparking guns , spinning tops & pinwheels and a series of hand held toys with sparking eyes called Archie ( s ) . They dedicated much of their time to causes that benefited children and the under-privileged in society .
Before long the company was producing a variety of high quality lamps , book ends , statues and other decorative items , prized today for their detail in the collector marketplace .
In 1913 Louis Aronson '' ' applied for a patent for a Liter ( lighter ) , which was approved along with others in years to come . In 1926 they released a new `` automatic operation '' Banjo lighter , which offered both ignition and extinguishment in a single push . It was a great success , demand shortly exceeding supply , spurring Aronson to patent it and design other products around the invention , which were marketed under the Ronson brand name .
With the success of the Art Metal Works and Ronson lighters , Aronson went on to become a Newark political and civic leader . They ran for Newark mayor in 1912 , was a longtime treasurer of Essex County , New Jersey , Republicans , and became a bank executive . In time , Aronson 's firm became the largest concern of its kind in the world .
Personal life
Aronson 's first wife , Gertrude Deutsch Aronson , died in 1934 . They remarried in 1935 , to stock-company actor Mabel Brownell .
Death
Louis V.Aronson died on November 2 , 1940 in Long Branch , New Jersey .

Critical reception
LA Weekly wrote : `` The Fireball Ministry sound is dry , heavy and stripped-down , brutal enough to match modern metal mutants like Queens of the Stone Age and Machine Head , but sufficiently song oriented to click with anyone enamored of Black Sabbath , Iron Maiden or any other classic hard-rock band you 'd care to name .

The SS Zivilabzeichen ( -Z.A . ) , was a badge of the SS issued between the years of 1933 and 1938 to SS members .
Translated as `` SS Civil Badge '' , the SS Zivilabzeichen was a small lapel pin worn on civilian clothing to denote membership in the SS . The badge was most commonly awarded to members of the Sicherheitspolizei who were veteran SS members . There appears to have been no set criteria for the SS-Z.A . 's issuance , and an SS member had only to apply to the SS-Hauptamt in order to receive the civil badge .
Known Civil Badge numbers
Adolf Hitler was given honorary SS number `` 1 '' and was awarded a Zivilabzeichen by the SS . The badge was stored in Hitler 's Munich apartment until it was taken by 1st LT Philip Ben Lieber in 1945 . The badge , along with a group of material owned by Hitler , was sold through Mohawk Arms to collectors Stephen Wolfe and Neil Hardin . In 2013 , the entire group was purchased by military antique collector and dealer Craig Gottlieb .

Harry Thomas Patterson , ( June 11 , 1920 – February 23 , 2005 ) was a Stratford , Ontario born journalist who went on to found the Stratford Festival of Canada , then called the Stratford Shakespearean Festival , the largest theatre festival in Canada .
Patterson was a veteran of World War II and a journalist writing for Maclean 's magazine in the early 1950s . From the time that they were a teenager , they had thought that their home town of Stratford , Ontario should be home to performances of Shakespeare 's plays . The town was suffering from industrial decline due to the declining fortunes of the rail industry . Patterson , with no experience of the theatre , proposed the idea of a theatre festival . In 1952 , they invited the prominent British director Tyrone Guthrie to visit Stratford and help bring their idea of a Shakespearean theatre to fruition . When Guthrie accepted the offer to visit , national newspapers started to take notice . Patterson told The Globe and Mail they wanted to provide `` Canadian acting talent the opportunity to work with top directors and actors without having to leave the country '' . For their part , Guthrie was interested in a venture that `` offers a fresh advance in the production of Shakespeare '' .
With Guthrie supporting the Festival idea , Patterson persuaded the town council to back it , and had an enthusiastic committee of local citizens to help organize it . Guthrie advised them to hire a big name for the first production , so Patterson received a small loan from the city council so they could visit Alec Guinness and invite them to perform in the opening season . The festival has grown and expanded significantly since that time .
Patterson served as the festival 's general manager during the first season and worked in other capacities until 1967 . They also founded the touring company Canadian Players with actor Douglas Campbell and took part in the establishment of a number of cultural institutions , including the Canadian Theatre Centre and the National Theatre School . Patterson was also the founder of the Dawson City Gold Rush Festival .
Patterson was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1967 and was also awarded the Order of Ontario . They also received honorary degrees from the University of Toronto and the University of Western Ontario . One of the festival theatres was named after them in 1991 , as is one of the islands in the Avon River .
Their memoirs , First Stage : The making of the Stratford Festival , co-authored with Allan Gould , were published in 1986 .

Wayne K. Blickenstaff ( June 25 , 1920 – December 23 , 2011 ) was a highly decorated United States Army Air Forces lieutenant colonel . They were a flying ace credited with 10 aerial victories , including five in a single day , for which they were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross during World War II .
Early life
Wayne K. Blickenstaff was born on June 25 , 1920 in Pomona , California . After graduating from Pomona High School , they attended Woodbury Business College in Los Angeles , California .
World War II
Blickenstaff enlisted in the Army Air Forces on January 28 , 1942 . They subsequently earned their flying wings and was commissioned as a second lieutenant . Lieutenant Blickenstaff was assigned to the 350th Fighter Squadron , 353rd Fighter Group , Eighth Air Force at RAF Metfield in Suffolk , England . They would fly a total of 133 combat missions during the war .
On December 1 , 1943 they damaged an Me109 over France . The squadron moved to RAF Raydon in Suffolk the following April . Blickenstaff was also promoted to captain and damaged another Me 109 that month . They later probably downed another over Germany on June 30 , 1944 . They were promoted to major in August .
Ace status
Major Blickenstaff finally scored their first official victory on November 27 , 1944 . Blickenstaff was leading their squadron to strafe an enemy supply depot in Germany . While near Brunswick , over 200 enemy planes attacked the American formations . Blickenstaff managed to shoot down four Fw190s despite the cowling of their own P-51 Mustang being hit by enemy fire . Since some of the oil lines in their plane were hit , Blickenstaff was forced to land at Denain Airfield in Prouvy , France . For their actions that day , Major Blickenstaff was awarded the Silver Star .
On February 22 , 1945 , Major Blickenstaff claimed their fifth victory of the war . While near Berlin , their squadron encountered four Me262 jets . Blickenstaff and their flight dropped their extra fuel tanks in an effort to gain speed and chased one jet for about seven minutes . Unable to catch the jet and nearing Soviet lines , their flight broke off the chase . While returning , Blickenstaff spotted another Me 262 flying below him . Gaining speed in a dive , they were able to score numerous hits on the jet , forcing the pilot to bail out . With this victory , Blickenstaff distinguished themselves as a flying ace , and one of the few American pilots credited with a jet kill . Blickenstaff was promoted to lieutenant colonel on March 7 , 1945 .
Ace in a day status
On March 24 , Lieutenant Colonel Blickenstaff was leading their squadron on a patrol near Kassel , Germany when they encountered approximately 15 Me109s providing top cover for a similar number of Fw190s several thousand feet below them . Blickenstaff quickly dove and got behind one Fw190 and shot it down . Blickenstaff then fired at an Me109 , getting several direct hits . They observed the canopy come off , but the plane crashed before the pilot had a chance to bail out .
While looking around for more targets , Lieutenant Colonel Blickenstaff observed a fellow P-51 pilot shoot down an Fw190 , which crashed into a tree line . Blickenstaff then saw an Me109 coming from their rear , but they were able to out-turn the aircraft and place several hits on it , causing it to crash into some trees .
At this point , Blickenstaff observed another pilot , Major Robert A . Elder , shoot down two Fw190s as another enemy plane was on their tail . The Fw190 on Elder 's tail broke off and Blickenstaff opened fire on the plane . Although only one of their guns fired , Blickenstaff was still able to shoot the Fw190 down . Blickenstaff then spotted another Fw190 and called for another pilot to shoot it down . When no one responded , Blickenstaff managed to shoot it down with their one machine gun that was still operating .
Blickenstaff claimed three Fw190s and two Me109s in 30 minutes , making them an ace in a day . Additionally , Major Elder also shot down five enemy planes . This was the only time in the history of Eighth Air Force when two pilots from the same unit destroyed five or more enemy aircraft in the same engagement . The squadron downed a total of 29 German aircraft , losing five of their own . Blickenstaff was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for their actions that day . These were their final victories of the war , bringing their total number to 10 .
Post-war
When the war ended , Blickenstaff was discharged from Army Air Forces as a lieutenant colonel . They attended the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles and became an artist/illustrator . They had three children from their first marriage and one child and three step-children from their second marriage . They retired in 1989 . Wayne K. Blickenstaff died on December 23 , 2011 in Charlotte , North Carolina .

Neil Goodman is an American sculptor and educator , known for bronze works that combine elegant arrangements and forms with hand-wrought , textured surfaces . They have explored a wide range of formats—still-life compositions , wall and floor installations , free-standing works and monumental public art—in a formalist style that has evolved from spare representation to abstraction and minimalism .
Goodman 's sculpture has been featured at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago ( `` Art in Chicago 1945-1995 '' survey ) , Indianapolis Museum of Art , Brauer Museum of Art , and Museum of Outdoor Arts ( 2018 ) . They have been awarded public commissions for Chicago 's McCormick Place Convention Center , the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art , Indiana University Northwest , and cities in Connecticut , Indiana and Michigan , among others . Curator Gregg Hertzlieb describes Goodman 's abstract sculptures as `` sophisticated explorations of formal issues [ that ] concurrently pulse with organic life … and appeal to the hand , the eye , and the mind . '' In an earlier review , New Art Examiner editor Kathryn Hixson called them a `` sculptor 's sculptor '' whose `` purposeful craftsmanship of ritualistic tableaux and talismanic objects '' engages `` the sensual shift from two to three dimensions . ''
After being based in the Chicago area and teaching at Indiana University Northwest for most of their career , Goodman lives and works on the Central Coast in California .
Early life and career
Goodman was born in 1953 in Hammond , Indiana , a steel-mill city outside of Chicago , whose industrial rust-belt landscape remains a key influence . Their college studies began in philosophy and religion , before they turned to pottery and then sculpture at Indiana University ( BA , Fine Arts and Religious Studies , 1976 ) . In the late 1970s , they were drawn to working in metal and completed postgraduate studies in sculpture at the Kansas City Art Institute ( 1977 ) and Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia ( MFA , Sculpture and Ceramics , 1979 ) . They secured a teaching position at Indiana University Northwest ( IUN ) in Gary in 1979 as a founding member of the Fine Arts department . In 1991 , they purchased a two-story residential loft building on Chicago 's south side that served as their studio and a home for him , their wife , JoEllyn Codespoti Goodman , and their children , Maurice and Hana Goodman , Jenna Wright and Stephen Stults .
Goodman emerged in the Chicago art scene with a two-person exhibition at the Chicago Cultural Center in 1980 , group shows at the Illinois State Museum and Dart , Struve , Roy Boyd and Randolph Street galleries , and solo shows at Frumkin & Struve Gallery ( his first in Chicago ) and the Indianapolis Center for Contemporary Art , among others . Their later exhibitions include a mid-career surveys at the Chicago Cultural Center ( 1997 ) and Indiana State Museum ( 2006 ) , a retrospective at the Museum of Outdoor Arts ( 2018 ) , and solos at the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art ( 1994 ) , Brauer Museum of Art ( 2016 ) , and Perimeter , Klein and Carl Hammer galleries in Chicago .
Since 2017 , Goodman has been an Emeritus Professor of Fine Arts at IUN , after nearly four decades there teaching and serving as department chair ( 1998–2001 , 2007–11 ) .
Work and reception
Goodman 's career is noted for its consistent modernist formal vocabulary , which has evolved through nuanced but significant experimentation from representation and narrative toward abstraction and minimalism ; they cite Giacometti and Brâncuși as important touchstones . Their work—primarily in bronze—is unified by : a visual grammar that emphasizes balance and strong lines ; a skillful mastery of technique and craft , including casting and painstaking hand-finished surfaces ; an emphasis on presentation and the relationship of sculpture to various spaces ( pedestals , walls , floors , galleries , outdoors ) ; and contrasts between industrial , architectural and geometric forms and natural-organic elements and textures . James Yood and Alan Artner , among others , note their sensitivity to bronze—its patina , luster , and malleability—which follows in the tradition of masters such as Henry Moore , Marini , Maillol and Giacometti .
Early work ( 1979–1993 )
Goodman 's early sculpture combines representation and abstraction , oblique narrative , and an almost archaeological concern with objects and the passage of time . Formally , it defies sculptural convention , interpreting painterly strategies , such as the still life and frontal , single-plane presentation , in bronze . Critics identify painters Pierre Chardin and Giorgio Morandi as key influences , while also relating the bio-abstraction of Arp , Brancusi , Isamu Noguchi and Yves Tanguy and the vitalist sculpture of Moore and Barbara Hepworth .
Goodman first gained attention for intimate , low-lying still lifes that bring together disparate artifacts and architectural elements in elegant familiar tableaux suggesting dinner settings or shelf arrangements ( e.g. , Still Life with Catfish , 1979 ; Still Life # 1 , 1988 ) . ARTnews critic Garrett Holg writes that the combinations of common , human-made objects ( rods , bowls , glasses , forks ) and droll castings of temporal organic forms ( vegetables , fish ) formed `` a profoundly eloquent discourse on the still life . '' James Yood wrote that Goodman 's `` isolated and huddled '' objects and pitted and scumbled surfaces convey hard-won existence and anonymous heroism with a `` majesty and quality of restraint reminiscent of Chardin . ''
Goodman 's imposing , freestanding `` Cage '' works have been likened to open-backed reliefs resembling altarpieces , which use thin , vertical architectonic frameworks to define and section interior spaces into platforms and compartments for the display of abstract and representational ( bowls , fish , implements ) forms . Critics highlight the series ' complex interrelationships and compositional variety , which ranges from near-screens of hieroglyphic-like screens ( Triptych , 1988 ) to delicate , shadow-box-like balances of fluid , multi-dimensional space ( Cyclades , 1986 ; Cage # 4 , 1988 ) . Goodman 's `` Bellingham Series '' ( 1990 ) offers `` mini-assemblages '' of reinvented nautical tools and other forms , whose significance relies less on symbolism than on sensitive , asymmetrical compositions ( e.g. , Ledge and Prop ) that hint at Cubist-like fragmentation .
Wall and floor groupings ( 1994– )
Goodman made a dramatic shift with their site-specific installation Subjects/Objects ( 1994 ) , which fully realized the frontality of earlier work and broke with traditional in-the-round sculptural presentation . It consisted of forty-seven free-floating , hand-wrought bronze wall-objects in a modular arrangement that emphasized dynamic rhythms achieved through contrasts between horizontal and vertical lines , organic and geometric shapes , and activated negative space ; critics likened the groupings of seemingly natural , ceremonial and utilitarian artifacts to a museum archaeological display or tools organized on a pegboard . Noting the objects ' intimacy and detailed textures , Kathryn Hixson wrote that Goodman `` dismantles the hype of monumental Modernism in favor of a hand-held , more useful version . '' In later installations at IUN ( Subjects-Objects , 1996 ) and the Chicago Cultural Center ( 1998 ) , Goodman explored arrangements that migrated across floors rather than walls .
Goodman 's free-floating separation of elements without containing or shared supports also detached their work from the self-referential traditions of formalism and the art-object , transforming it into something open-ended and interior like language , which viewers are left to complete . Margaret Hawkins links this aspect formally and symbolically to Goodman 's traditional Jewish youth reading Hebrew , which shares a sense of heightened meaning derived from code-like forms ; the connection is most evident in two subsequent public wall commissions : Temple Jeremiah ( 1995 , Northbrook , Illinois ) and Jewish Heritage Museum ( 1998 , Danville , California ) .
In 1997 , Goodman created Passage for Chicago 's McCormick Place South Pavilion , a 90 ' x 15 ' permanent wall installation that features an `` alphabet '' of more than 130 forms , many nautical , reflecting its lakeside locale ; a triangular-shaped , stairwell wall-piece , Subject-Object ( 2000 ) , resides in the Block Museum of Art in Evanston , Illinois . With the later works Biography ( 2011 ) and Eclipse ( 2014 ) , Goodman returned to monumental wall-works , in this case linking bronze elements in the manner of chain mail ; ARTnews likened the former to a giant pendant of blade forms evocative of symbolic code , tribal ornamentation and `` mod , space-age forms . ''
Outdoor public sculpture and gallery work ( 2000– )
After winning a competition in 2000 to create an outdoor work for the Dow Centennial Sculpture Garden in Midland , Michigan ( Centennial Passage ) , Goodman began conceiving sculptures in terms of site-specificity and multiple vantage points , encouraging viewers to move around and look at and through sculptures to notice shifting forms , voids and relationships to architecture , space , and landscape . More inclusive , participatory and conversational—as suits the social dimension of public art—this work was also , in formal terms , emphatically linear and more minimal , open and three-dimensional . This approach extended to Goodman 's gallery exhibitions , which often presented motifs and works later adapted for monumental outdoor pieces and recreated the ensemble sense of a sculpture park , with great attention to placement , scale , lighting and interrelationships .
Between 2000–6 , Goodman developed their `` Shadows and Echoes '' works , which redefine and re-contextualize their environments through linear windows , frames and passages . The series—formally unified by repetitions of line , module and motif ( loops , arcs , arches , pyramids , wedges ) —was inspired by disparate sources connected by inherent design structures : abstracted nature ( e.g. , Slither , Reach ) , geometry ( Four Corners ) , industrial leftovers ( Crank , Mirror ) , the arabesques of the Moorish Alhambra ( Andalusia ) . Curator Geoffrey Bates describes them as sculpted with a `` beautifully controlled '' fine line rather than mass , `` creating sculptural presence from empty space '' ; Margaret Hawkins describes them as `` light as paper '' and airy , like music or mathematical equations , despite their heft . The series culminated in a sculpture garden at the center of the IUN campus that features ten monumental bronze outdoor sculptures interacting with a native landscape designed by Cynthia Owen-Bergland . In 2010 , Goodman installed five `` Shadows and Echoes '' works cast in fiberglass in an outdoor exhibition at the Nathan Manilow Sculpture Park in University Park , Illinois .
In their exhibitions of the 2010s , Goodman continued to pare down motifs inspired by industrial , geometric , and natural forms in freestanding , floor and wall pieces that retain their varied , organic surfaces . Their vertical , roughly human-sized , freestanding `` Columns '' ( 2015–7 ) repeat , invert , and conjoin basic `` U '' shapes with blade-like forms in bronze , creating a linear , rhythmic interplay that implies both anthropomorphic and anthropological references ( e.g. , Cabal and Twist ) . Robin Dluzen suggests that the light networks of intersecting lines in pieces such as Turn reflect the rowed vineyards of California , Goodman 's new home . The New Art Examiner describes the contemplation of this work from various angles as a hall-of-mirrors-like multiplicity conveying `` a new minimalist strangeness . ''
A second , horizontal series employs shard-like , trapezoidal forms of greater mass with rectangular `` windows '' or openings that maximize the synergy of positive and negative spaces , and like earlier work , offer shifting perspectives on their surroundings ( e.g. , Twilight I and Twilight II ) . Presented as pedestal pieces in gallery shows , these works doubled as studies for the monumental outdoor bronze sculptures Night and Day ( 2019 , commissioned by the Brauer Museum for Valparaiso University ) and Rudder ( 2017 , Museum of Outdoor Arts ) . Margaret Hawkins and other writers describe these later outdoor works as less about substance than about their voids— '' yawning , crooked windows '' that frame views and allude to spiritual questions , such as the relationship between being and non-being .
Writing
In their later career , Goodman has also turned to art writing . They have contributed reviews , essays and interviews to the New Art Examiner , on the Confederate Mound at Chicago 's Oak Woods Cemetery and artists including Rembrandt , Kehinde Wiley , Adam Silverman , and Richard Rezac , as well as a memorial to the late Chicago art dealer , Paul Klein . They also wrote the introductory essay for the book , Contemporary Sculptors of Chicago ( 2020 ) , and an essay for the catalog Night and Day , for their commission at Valparaiso University ( 2020 ) .
Recognition and collections
In addition to asupervisorstioned works , Goodman has been awarded public commissions by the City of Chicago ( Chicago Public Library , 1995 ; Martin Luther King Gateway Renovation , 1996 ; Geography Earth , 2002 , Burnham Park Children 's Garden ) , UBS Warburg Tower ( 2002 ) , Greater Hartford Arts Council/Lincoln Financial ( Frontier Life , 2009 , Hartford , Connecticut ) , the Munster ( Indiana ) Public Art Committee ( Prairie Passage , 2009 , with Terry Karpowicz ) , and Indiana University Northwest ( Tapestry , 2011 ) .
Their work belongs to the public art collections of the Brauer Museum of Art , Illinois State Museum , Indiana State Museum , Madden Museum of Art , Museum of Outdoor Arts , and Rockford Museum of Art , as well as many corporate and private collections .

Tedald was archbishop of Milan ( died in Milan on 25 May 1085 ) from 1075 to 1085 .
Early life
Tedald was born into a noble family in Milan . They entered into the service of King Henry IV of Germany who employed them in the royal chapel .
Archbishop
Henry IV made Tedald archbishop of Milan in 1075 . When appointing Tedald to the archbishopric , Henry ignored their former decision about the appointment of another cleric , Godfrey , to the same see . The King also disregarded the claim of Pope Gregory VII 's candidate , Atto , to the archbishopric . The suffragan bishops consecrated Tedald archbishop .
Tedald approached Pope Gregory , seeking the Pope 's `` friendship '' in a letter , but the Pope was unwilling to acknowledge the royal investiture . On 8 December , Gregory forbade the Archbishop 's suffragan bishops to consecrate Tedald and summoned Tedald to Rome to give an account of their appointment . The Pope regarded Tedald as a rebel and a renegade and accused them of claiming the see of the lawful archbishop , Atto .
The Pope excommunicated Tedald at an unknown date .
Henry IV made their three-year-old son , Conrad , their lieutenant in Italy before returning to Germany early in 1077 . On the same occasion , the King appointed Tedald and Denis , Bishop of Piacenza , as their son 's guardians . Tedald 's excommunication was renewed at the Lenten synods of Rome in 1078 , 1079 and 1080 .
Tedald was one of the nineteen Italian prelates to attend the synod that Henry IV held at Brixen on 25 June 1080 . The assembled prelates declared that Pope Gregory VII 's election had been invalid . Historian David J Hay has suggested Tedald was the leader of the coalition of Lombard bishops that defeated Matilda of Tuscany at the battle of Volta Mantovana in October 1080 .
Tedald and their suffragans appointed one thousand knights to accompany King Henry to Rome in 1082 .
Tedald died in Milan on 25 May 1085 ( on the same day as Pope Gregory VII ) .

Mitcham Common is 182 hectares ( 460 acres ) of common land situated in south London . It is predominantly in the London borough of Merton , with parts straddling the borders of Croydon and Sutton . It is designated a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation .
History
In feudal times , the poorest , least productive soil in a parish was designated as common land available for parishioners to graze animals and cut turf and timber for fuel . Members of this community with these rights were known as commoners . However , in the 19th century when material for road building became a valuable resource , the old grazing land was replaced by a series of pits for gravel extraction .
These works reached such a proportion that public opposition , led by George Parker Bidder QC , culminated in the protection of the common under the Metropolitan Commons Act and the cost of its maintenance was split between the parish councils of Mitcham , Beddington , Wallington and Croydon according to the proportion of the common within each parish boundary .
Mitcham , now part of the London Borough of Merton bears the majority of the costs , with the remainder going to the London Boroughs of Croydon and Sutton . These funds support a warden and three assistants . Each council is represented by four nominated members of The Board , elected every two years .
Geography and environment
The course of the Thames has gradually altered , exposing gravels that were initially colonised by grasses and other Flowering Plants . Over time , woody species slowly overwhelmed these early colonisers , developing a loose scrubby vegetation that became denser until woodland had developed . Early humans were responsible for clearing trees and suppressing their regeneration by grazing cattle and cutting turf and timber for fuel .
In the late 19th Century these practices ceased and woodland was allowed to regenerate . This process allowed a succession from grassland , through a series of intermediate stages , to woodland .
The river gravels are well drained and strongly acidic , leading to a hostile environment in which plants have to withstand occasional drought and nutrient deficiency . However , considerable areas have acquired foreign soils during landfill programmes , whilst ploughing for agriculture during World War II and numerous pipe laying programmes have brought trapped nutrients to the surface . The result is a patchwork of soil types , each providing different plant and animal habitats . As the grassland reverts to woodland , the various stages in this process create further habitats .
The Seven Islands pond is the largest of the ponds on the common , and was created as the result of gravel extraction during the 19th century . The most recent pond to be created , Bidder 's pond , was created in 1990 and named for George Parker Bidder .
Buildings
There are a few buildings on the common . The buildings comprising the Windmill Trading Estate have existed in one form or another since 1782 , when the estate was established as workhouses for the poor . Companies to have utilised the buildings include Hooper 's Telegraph Works . Recently the Estate has been replaced by a mixed-tenure of housing apartments . The Mill House Ecology Centre and the Harvester ( formerly the Mill House Pub ) are located near the site of an old windmill , the remnants of which still exist . There also exists upon the common a carved granite stone in commemoration of George Parker Bidder .

Born in Kapsigoria Village in Kenya 's Elgeyo Marakwet county , Chepkwony 's first success came at the 2001 African Junior Athletics Championships , where they were the silver medallist in the 5000 metres behind Vivian Cheruiyot . In 2004 , they were second in the 5000 metres at both the Kenyan Athletics Championships and the Olympic trial race . They did not have the qualifying time to attend the 2004 Athens Olympics , but was selected for the 2004 African Championships in Athletics and won the bronze medal at that competition .
They won their first national title in 2005 and set an 800 m best of 2:03.6 , but again did not have the standard for the major championship ( the 2005 World Championships ) . They competed at the 2006 Commonwealth Games but did not make it past the first round . It was that year that they first began to compete in European road races and they won the Spiridon Silvesterlauf , Basler Stadtlauf , Course de l'Escalade , Course du Noël and set a course record at La Corrida Bulloise . They continued to mix road races and track running in 2007 and ran for Kenya in both the 800 m and the 1500 metres at the 2007 All-Africa Games .
Chepkwony missed the 2008 season but successfully returned in 2009 with a focus on road events , winning the Course de l'Escalade for a second time and taking the Hamburg Half Marathon title with a time of 1:15:22 for their debut over the distance . They competed in smaller scale events in 2010 but was rewarded with numerous victories , including the Lotto Cross Cup Brussels , the Kö-Lauf and Alsterlauf Hamburg 10K runs , half marathons in Hamburg and Altötting , and the Zürcher Silvesterlauf . In 2011 , they retained their titles in Brussels , Hamburg and Zürich , as well winning the Course du Noël for a second time . In addition , they won the Murtenlauf and Kerzerslauf races for the first time .
The 2012 saw Chepkwony begin to participate in higher standard road competitions . They ran a personal best of 68:36 minutes for third place at the Berlin Half Marathon , then won the BIG 25 Berlin race . This earned them a place in the elite selection for the 2012 Berlin Marathon and in their first attempt at the classic distance they managed to finish in 2:30:34 hours , coming in seventh place . Aside from their exploits in Berlin they repeated their win at the Kerzerslauf ( setting a course record ) , won the Grand Prix von Bern 10-miler , and had another win at the Course du Noël .
They made three half marathon outings in 2013 and finished in the top three each time , coming third at the Paris Half Marathon and runner-up at the Göteborgsvarvet and Ústí nad Labem Half Marathon .

In publishing , a callout or call-out is a short string of text connected by a line , arrow , or similar graphic to a feature of an illustration or technical drawing , and giving information about that feature . The term is also used to describe a short piece of text set in larger type than the rest of the page and intended to attract attention .
In documents that need to be translated often a neutral callout is used . By using numbers or letters as callout in combination with an image caption , translation is more efficient since the same graphic can be used in all languages .
A similar device in word processing is a special text box with or without a small `` tail '' that can be pointed to different locations on a document .
In the utility industry , a callout is an instruction to report for emergency or special work at an unusual time or place .

It is crossed , to the south , by the `` Circuito Norte '' ( CN ) , a state highway connecting the nearby Mantua to Baracoa , in Guantánamo Province , through the northern coastal area of the whole country . A secondary highway , the 1-121 , connects the village to Minas de Matahambre and Pinar del Río , the provincial capital .

Melville Jean Herskovits ( September 10 , 1895 – February 25 , 1963 ) was an American anthropologist who helped to first establish African and African Diaspora studies in American academia . They are known for exploring the cultural continuity from African cultures as expressed in African-American communities . They worked with their wife Frances ( Shapiro ) Herskovits , also an anthropologist , in the field in South America , the Caribbean and Africa . They jointly wrote several books and monographs .
Early life and education
Born to Jewish immigrants in Bellefontaine , Ohio , in 1895 , Herskovits attended local public schools . They served in the United States Army Medical Corps in France during World War I .
Afterward , they went to college , earning a Bachelor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago in 1923 . They went to New York City for graduate work , earning their M.A . and Ph.D. in anthropology from Columbia University under the guidance of the German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas . This subject was in its early decades of being developed as a formal field of study . Their dissertation , titled The Cattle Complex in East Africa , investigated theories of power and authority in Africa as expressed in the ownership and raising of cattle . They studied how some aspects of African culture and traditions were expressed in African American culture in the 1900s .
Among their fellow students were future anthropologists Katherine Dunham , Ruth Benedict , Margaret Mead , Elsie Clews Parsons , and Frances Shapiro . They and Shapiro married in Paris in 1924 . They later had a daughter , Jean Herskovits , who became a historian .
Career
In 1927 , Herskovits moved to Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , as a full-time anthropologist . In 1928 and 1929 they and their wife Frances Herskovits did field work in Suriname , among the Saramaka ( then called Bush Negroes ) and jointly wrote a book about the people .
In 1934 , Herskovits and their wife Frances spent more than three months in the Haitian village of Mirebalais , the findings of which research they published in their 1937 book Life in a Haitian Valley . In its time , this work was considered one of the most accurate depictions of the Haitian practice of Vodou . They meticulously detailed the lives and Vodou practices of Mirebalais residents during their three-month stay . They conducted field work in Benin , Brazil , Haiti , Ghana , Nigeria and Trinidad . In 1938 Herskovits established the new Department of Anthropology at Northwestern .
In the early 1940s , Herskovits and their wife Frances met Barbara Hadley Stein , who was in Brazil to do research on abolition of slavery there . They introduced to them Stanley J. Stein , a graduate student in Latin American history at Harvard . With advice from Herskovits , Stein and Stein recorded black songs called jongos , which have recently received considerable scholarly attention . Herskovits also influenced Alan Lomax , who collected African American songs .
In 1948 , Herskovits founded the first major interdisciplinary American program in African studies at Northwestern University with aid of a three-year , $ 30,000 grant from the Carnegie Foundation , followed by a five-year $ 100,000 grant from the Ford Foundation in 1951 . The Program of African Studies was the first of its kind at a United States academic institution . The goals of the program were to `` produce scholars of competence in their respective subjects , who will focus the resources of their special fields on the study of aspects of African life relevant to their disciplines . ''
The Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies at Northwestern University , established in 1954 , is the largest separate Africana collection in the world . To date , it contains more than 260,000 bound volumes , including 5,000 rare books , more than 3,000 periodicals , journals and newspapers , archival and manuscript collections , 15,000 books in 300 different African languages , extensive collections of maps , posters , videos and photographs , as well as electronic resources . In 1957 , Herskovits founded the African Studies Association and was the organization 's first president .
Herskovits 's book The Myth of the Negro Past is about African cultural influences on African Americans ; it rejects the notion that African Americans lost all traces of their past when they were taken from Africa and enslaved in America . They traced numerous elements expressed in the contemporary African-American culture that could be traced to African cultures . Herskovits emphasized race as a sociological concept , not a biological one . They also helped forge the concept of cultural relativism , particularly in their book Man and Their Works . This book examines in depth the effects of westernization on Africans of diverse cultures who were brought during slavery to the Americas , and who then developed a distinctly different African-American culture as a product of this displacement . As LeRoi Jones has commented on this text , some believe that the introduction of these Africans to Christianity is what propelled such westernization . Christian concepts shifted slave narratives from an emphasis on travelling home to their African countries of origin to traveling home to see their Lord , in Heaven . The development of African-American Christian churches , which served as one of the only places to provide these peoples with access to social mobility , further established a distinctly western culture among Africans in America . Along with these churches came Negro spirituals , which are cited as likely the first kind of music native to America made by Africans . Nonetheless , the development of such spirituals included direct influence from the African roots . This became apparent in a number of aspects of the spirituals , from the inclusion of call and response lines and alternate scales to the varied timbres and rhythms . All of this goes to show that Herskovits 's claims in this book carry much truth and accuracy in regards to the establishment of the African American identity as descendant of that of the African , and how music played into such shifts .
Herskovits debated with sociologist E. Franklin Frazier on the nature of cultural contact in the Western Hemisphere , specifically with reference to Africans , Europeans , and their descendants . Frazier emphasized how Africans had adapted to their new environment in the Americas . Herskovits was interested in showing elements of continuity from African cultures into the present community .
After World War II , Herskovits publicly advocated independence of African nations from the colonial powers . They strongly criticized American politicians for viewing African nations as objects of Cold War strategy . Frequently called on as an adviser to government , Herskovits served on the Mayor 's Committee on Race Relations in Chicago ( 1945 ) and the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee ( 1959–60 ) .
Legacy and honors
The Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies at Northwestern University was named in their honor ; it is based on their collection of materials as chairperson of the department .
The Herskovits Prize ( Melville J. Herskovits Award ) is an annual award given by the African Studies Association to the best scholarly work ( including translations ) on Africa published in English in the previous year .

History
The name of Brgy . Pangdan was coined after a plant commonly called “ pandan ” or pandan leaves ( Pandanus amaryllifolius ) which is widely used in cooking as a flavoring . The plant is rare in the wild , but is widely cultivated . It is an upright , green plant with fan-shaped sprays of long , narrow , blade-like leaves and woody aerial roots .
Starting from small barrio in 1942 during the Japanese time when the people are just using “ lampara ” to light their homes and streets having no electricity the place has now evolved into a big barangay . In 2012 , the population of Brgy . Pandan is estimated to be more or less 3,984 .

Economy
In terms of livelihood , Brgy . Pangdan is still classified to be rural in spite of its nearness to the capital town . Fishing is the main livelihood of the people while upland farming is only considered as secondary source of income . Frequently children are seen roaming the community selling fish by plates just to help their parents augment the family income earn extra money .
Local micro-entrepreneurs and business people also exist and are engaged in managing Sari-sari , fish drying , copra making and passenger motorboat operators to support the daily needs of their families .

Elfstedentocht
Bartlehiem is especially well-known due to the Elfstedentocht for ice skaters , who have to pass through the hamlet twice . Coming from the west from Feinsum through the Feinsumer Feart , a wide ditch . Skaters then pass the famous wooden bicycle and pedestrian bridge of Bartlehiem , after the bridge they skate north over the Dokkumer Ie to Dokkum . On return they turn left to the east over the Aldtsjerkster Feart , a similar ditch . From here it is approx 10 km to the finish line on the Bonkefeart in Leeuwarden .

The Statue of Robert Falcon Scott commemorates Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott . It is located at the intersection of Oxford Terrace and Worcester Street in the Christchurch Central City , New Zealand . The statue , carved by Scott 's widow Kathleen Scott , is registered as a Category II historic place . The statue toppled off its plinth in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and broke in half ; it was temporarily on display in the Christchurch Earthquake Museum in City Mall . The Scott statue was reinstated in October 2017 .
Context
The explorer Scott had used Christchurch and Lyttelton as their New Zealand base for the British National Antarctic Expedition , 1901–1904 and Terra Nova Expedition , 1910–1913 . In between , Ernest Shackleton 's Nimrod Expedition also used Lyttelton as the base for their attempt to reach the South Pole , but they failed to get there . The objective of the Terra Nova Expedition was to be the first to reach the geographical South Pole . Scott and four companions reached the pole on 1912 , to find that a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had preceded them by 33 days . Scott 's entire party died on the return journey from the pole . Their deaths resulted in them being treated as heroes throughout the British Empire .
The remaining crew returned to New Zealand and came ashore in British Empire , from where a coded message was cabled to the expedition 's organiser in Britain . The fate of the expedition 's team became public knowledge on 11 February 1913 . A memorial oak was planted in the street leading to the harbourmaster 's house , from where the message was relayed . The next memorial was erected in Queenstown , where two stone tablets were attached to a boulder in the Queenstown Gardens . A few months later , a memorial was erected in Port Chalmers , as this was the last harbour where the Terra Nova had visited before proceeding to Antarctica .
History
The Mayor of Christchurch , Henry Holland , called for a public meeting to organise a memorial fund within one week of the news of Scott 's death . A committee was formed and over £1,000 was raised . Whilst the form of the memorial or its location had not been decided upon , the committee wrote to Scott 's widow and enquired about their thoughts . This resulted in them being engaged to sculpt a statue of their late husband .
The commission was for Kathleen Scott to create a replica of the bronze statue erected in Waterloo Place in London in 1915 . The rising costs of metal caused by World War I made marble a more cost effective option . They went to carve the statue in Carrara in Italy in March 1916 , as the importation of marble into Britain had been banned . They said about the block that was measuring :
You will be glad to hear that it is a remarkably fine piece of marble , of a good colour and without any flaw whatever . Considering the great size this is very fortunate .
The statue was finished in April 1916 , but was not shipped until October of that year due to the war . It was unveiled by the Governor , The Earl of Liverpool , on the corner of Worcester Street and Oxford Terrace on 9 February 1917 , facing north and looking towards the building that was then the civic offices . The inscription on the plinth , which is one of their last diary entries , reads :
I do not regret this journey , which shows that Englishmen can endure hardships , help one another , and meet death with as great fortitude as ever in the past .
The inscription had become unreadable by 1922 and a separate marble plaque with this text was installed at the entrance to the reserve . Another plaque lists the names of the five men who died . Recognition grew of Kathleen Scott after the 1995 publication of a biography , and in 1998 a further plaque was added recognising her :
This statue was sculpted by Kathleen Scott FRSBS ( 1878–1947 ) Widow of Captain Scott , and was unveiled in 1917 .
The statue was not quite finished . The details of the gloves have not been done , and one of the legs rests against a stump to support the figure . Kathleen Scott had offered to undertake this additional work when they returned to Christchurch , but this did not eventuate .
The statue toppled off its plinth in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake . It broke into two pieces and was put into storage . It was on public display during the November 2012 Icefest , and , from January 2016 , was on display in Christchurch 's Earthquake Museum , which is part of the Canterbury Museum , in City Mall .
Heritage listing
On 26 November 1981 , the statue was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place , with the registration number being 1840 . It is one of seven memorials that Kathleen Scott sculpted after their husband 's death . It also demonstrates Christchurch 's link with Antarctic exploration , being the base for Shackleton and Scott in the past , and being the Gateway to the Antarctic by providing the Italian , New Zealand and United States of America bases these days at Christchurch International Airport .

Justice is a Major Arcana tarot card , numbered either VIII or XI , depending on the deck . This card is used in game playing as well as in divination .
Description
The Justice card , as a member of the tarot deck , appears in early tarot , such as the Tarot de Marseilles . It is part of the tarot 's Major Arcana , and usually follows the Chariot , as card VIII , although some decks vary from this pattern . The virtue Justice accompanies two of the other cardinal virtues in the Major Arcana : temperance and strength .
The figure on the card holds a scale made of gold in their left hand , symbolizing a balanced decision .
Interpretation
According to A. E. Waite 's 1910 book Pictorial Key to the Tarot , the Justice card carries several divinatory associations :
11 . JUSTICE.—Equity , rightness , probity , executive ; triumph of the deserving side in law . Reversed : Law in all its departments , legal complications , bigotry , bias , excessive severity .
In astrology , the Justice card is associated with the planet Venus and Libra zodiac sign .
Numbering
Justice is traditionally the eighth card , and Strength the eleventh , but the influential Rider–Waite–Smith deck switched the position of these two cards in order to make them better fit the astrological correspondences worked out by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , under which the eighth card is associated with Leo and the eleventh with Libra . This switch was originally suggested in the mysterious Cipher Manuscripts which formed the basis for the Golden Dawn 's teachings regarding tarot and other subjects . Today many divinatory tarot decks use this numbering , particularly in the English-speaking world .

Hancock County is a county located in the U.S. state of Georgia . As of the 2010 census , the population was 9,429 . The county seat is Sparta . The county was created on December 17 , 1793 , and named for John Hancock , a Founding Father of the American Revolution .
Hancock County is included in the Milledgeville , Georgia Micropolitan Statistical Area .
History
Before the Civil War , Hancock County was developed for cotton plantations , as international demand was high for the commodity . The land was developed and the cotton cultivated and processed by thousands of enslaved African Americans . This area is classified as part of the Black Belt of the United States , primarily due to its fertile soil . It was later also associated with the slave society . Enslaved persons made up 61 % of the total county population in the 1850 Census . Unusually for such a plantation-dominated society , the county 's representatives at the Georgia Secession Convention , who were overwhelmingly white and Democratic , voted against secession in 1861 .
But the secession conventions were dominated by men who voted for separation , and Georgia soon seceded and entered the war .
After the war , the freed black population predominated by number in the county for decades . After emancipation and granting of citizenship and the franchise , most freedmen joined the Republican Party , which they credited with gaining their freedom . Conservative white Democrats resisted political domination by blacks , although they were outnumbered . In the later years of Reconstruction , whites used violence , intimidation and fraud to suppress black voting . In 1908 the white-dominated legislature passed an amendment that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor whites ones .
Contemporary voting issues
According to the 2010 census estimate , the racial makeup of the county seat of Sparta was 84 % African American , 15 % White , 0.50 % from two or more races , 0.30 % Asian , and 0.10 % Native American . Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.70 % of the population .
Since the late 20th century , most African Americans support the Democratic Party and conservative whites support the Republican Party .
In August 2015 , the majority-white Hancock County Board of Elections initiated an effort to purge voters from the rolls . They directed deputy sheriffs to the homes of more than 180 black people residing in Sparta ( these constituted some 20 % of the city 's total registered voters ) to inform them they would lose their voting rights unless they appeared in court to prove their residency . A total of 53 voters were removed the voting rolls , but a federal judge overturned the Board 's actions . It was asserted that these actions were racially based .
In 2021 , the African-American elections superintendent for the City of Sparta was referred to the Georgia Secretary of State 's Office for prosecution for allegedly imposing illegal requirements for candidates in the 2017 municipal election .
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the county has a total area of , of which is land and ( 1.4 % ) is water .
The western portion of Hancock County , which is defined by a line running southeast from White Plains to the intersection of State Route 22 and Springfield Road , then running southwest along State Route 22 , is located in the Upper Oconee River sub-basin of the Altamaha River basin . The southern portion of the county , defined by a triangle made of State Route 22 and State Route 15 , with Sparta at its apex , is located in the Lower Oconee River sub-basin of the same Altamaha River basin . The northeastern portion of Hancock County is located in the Upper Ogeechee River sub-basin of the Ogeechee River basin .

Politics
Hancock County has arguably been the most consistent Democratic county in the entire nation since the Civil War . But the composition of the party voters and policies they support have undergone major changes since the late twentieth century , switching from whites to African Americans .
The majority of county voters have voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in every election since 1852 except that of 1972 , when George McGovern lost every county in Georgia . McGovern did perform better here than elsewhere in the state , losing by only 93 votes . Apart from Richard Nixon in that election , Barry Goldwater in 1964 was the only Republican since at least 1912 to gain 30 percent of the county 's vote . That year , most of the county 's African-American majority was still largely disenfranchised and could not vote at all . The conservative white minority favored Goldwater because its traditional Democratic loyalties had frayed .
In 1980 Hancock County gave the its `` favorite son '' candidate Jimmy Carter their second best county in the nation . In 1984 it supported Walter Mondale , who won more than 76.6 percent of Hancock County ballots , making it their fourth-best county outside the District of Columbia . They were otherwise within 3,819 votes of losing all fifty states .

Skinny Tiger , Fatty Dragon ( ) is a 1990 Hong Kong martial arts film directed by Lau Kar-wing , who also co-stars in the film . The film stars Sammo Hung and Karl Maka . The trio had worked together in the late 1970s , making two films for Lau and Hung 's short-lived Gar Bo Motion Picture Company . Whilst Lau continued to appear in Hung 's films for Golden Harvest throughout the 1980s , Maka had gone on to co-run Cinema City . Skinny Tiger , Fatty Dragon was therefore something of a reunion for the three actors .
Plot
Fatty and Baldy are a pair of detectives dealing with a crime syndicate of Triad gangsters . After a jewelry robbery , they later find Lai , a woman who is associated with the gangsters , but end up getting themselves into trouble for going into the women 's changing room .

Bruce Lee references
Sammo Hung impersonated Bruce Lee in two early films prior to this , Enter the Fat Dragon and Millionaire 's Express with Cynthia Rothrock in a brief fight together . This is the final film in which they relate the early Lee references into the 90 's .
The tap with the two metal bars is seen in Game of Death with Bruce Lee and Dan Inosanto before the nunchaku fight . Also the use of the nunchaku is used in the finale at an abandoned warehouse full of barrels which goes back to Fist of Fury in which Lee introduces the weapon and Enter the Fat Dragon in which Sammo first used the weapon .
Hung holding of one of the henchman 's hair is seen in Enter the Dragon in which Jackie Chan tries to attack Bruce but got their neck snapped off camera .
The brief fight with Sammo Hung and Mark Houghton is similar to Way of the Dragon with Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris . Then follows up with Lee attacking the guy with the gun while in Nora Miao 's apartment .
The German shepherd dog is a reference to The Big Boss . Also is the use of the double knives in the finale of both movies although shot in a different way .
During the robbery attack , Hung attacking the man on the ground with the groin attack is similar to Way of the Dragon with Lee and Bob Wall .
Hung 's kick shot with Ridley Tsui in the abandoned warehouse is similar to Enter the Dragon with Lee 's kick to Shih Kien 's head .
Proposed villain role
When Bey Logan interviewed Mark Houghton , they initially are tasked to find a black business person which is supposed to be another tribute to Game of Death . Unfortunately they offended a few of them with one who believes they have no business in being in the film . Houghton thought they would be in trouble for offending a black business person so they told Lau Kar-wing that they could n't find any so the director would step in as the main bad guy for this role .
Location
Much of the film was recorded in Singapore , but the rest was filmed in the New Territories and Hong Kong .
Overall look at the film
In an interview on DVD with Lau Kar-wing , Karl Maka , who looked at the film , felt there was lack of balance between comedy and action . Initially there 's too much action and not enough comedy , so the film was changed to improve the balance .
Box office
Skinny Tiger , Fatty Dragon earned HK $ 10,270,954.00 at the Hong Kong box office .
Reception
Bey Logan pointed out on the commentary track of the Hong Kong Legends DVD release of the movie why the film was moderately successful . There are certain logic and structural issues which are considered to be negative aspects . A few examples were the car chasing sequence in which they explain that if the heroes were just to call the police , the villains would be arrested , the film would be over and the scene would n't be as funny . The other is the Singapore holiday as they explain , after the Chinese wedding catastrophe , the film should be gaining momentum but instead goes down like a holiday expedition . So overall , the pace of the story is let down for that reason .
For western audiences , the character of 'Baldy ' , played by Karl Maka , is described as being 'over the top ' . Maka was known for playing similar characters , most prominently in the Aces Go Places series . However , this was really playing to the less sophisticated Asian audiences of the time , that did like this style of broad humour .
More well received were the action sequences with Sammo Hung . After Bruceploitation , fans of Bruce Lee would disregard any film that tried to poorly imitate Lee 's films . However , in Logan 's opinion , Hung 's style of action is regarded as successful because of the way they are able to interpret Lee in their own style , whilst designing fight sequences that are able to incorporate early Bruce Lee references in a unique fashion .
Also , because of their previous work on Enter the Fat Dragon , Hung is more accepted as a Bruce Lee impersonator , because of their early appearance in Enter the Dragon , their action choreography and also their involvement in Game of Death . Also of importance are their bulky appearance and the fact that they do n't look like Lee ( apart from their pudding bowl haircut ) .

The Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral Parish ( ) , otherwise known as Kabankalan Cathedral ( ) , is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kabankalan in the Philippines . It is located in the city proper of Kabankalan , Negros Occidental , in the Western Visayas region of the country .
History
Christianization efforts in the island of Negros were started by the Augustinian Recollects during the Spanish colonial period . Kabankalan , then spelled as Cavancalan and Cabangcalan , was formerly a sitio of the neighboring municipality of Ilog . It is named after the bangkal tree . Kabankalan received its first parish priest in 1848 . A chapel was built in 1905 by Fr . Tiburcio Fernandez . In March 1997 , Kabankalan was separated formally from Ilog as an independent municipality through the Philippine Commission 's Act 1612 . The present church structure was built and inaugurated in December 1935 by Fr . Felipe Lerena . It was dedicated to Saint Francis Xavier , a 16th-century Jesuit priest . Among those who helped in building the church were Manuel Montinola , Engineer M. Sales , and the hacenderos of the province 's sugar industry . The church of Kabankalan was elevated to the status of a cathedral when the diocese of Kabankalan was founded in 1987 . The diocese administers the southern portion of Negros Occidental .

The white-throated jacamar ( Brachygalba albogularis ) is a species of bird in the family Galbulidae . It is found in Bolivia , Brazil and Peru .
Taxonomy and systematics
The white-throated jacamar is monotypic . It and the dusky-backed ( B. salmoni ) , pale-headed ( B. goeringi ) , and brown jacamars ( B. lugubris ) form a superspecies .
Description
The white-throated jacamar is long . The male is distinguished by its white face and throat ; its upper parts are dark brown to black with a greenish blue gloss . The belly is also dark brown to black with a chestnut patch in its center . The female is similar , though its chestnut patch may be larger .
Distribution and habitat
The white-throated jacamar is found in a small area of the upper Amazon Basin where eastern Peru , western Brazil , and northern Bolivia abut . It inhabits the edges of primary várzea forest or young growth along whitewater rivers . Examples of the latter include river islands and Gynerium cane and bamboo stands . It is mostly found from mid level up to the canopy . In elevation it has been recorded up to in Peru .
Behavior
Feeding
The white-throated jacamar 's diet is poorly known , but Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera have been identified . It perches in small groups on exposed branches in the canopy and sallies from there to catch its flying prey .
Breeding
One detailed study of the white-throated jacamar 's breeding phenology was in Peru 's Manu National Park . Nests were found in August and September ; they were partially hidden burrows in vertical stream banks . Up to four adults provisioned the young .
Vocalization
The white-throated jacamar 's song is `` a high , thin series of whistles ... 'pee-pipi-peeee tewee tewee tewee ' '' . Its call is `` a plaintive upslurred 'psueet ' or 'kuweei ' ” .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the white-throated jacamar as being of The Least Concern . `` No immediate threats are recorded , although it is probably sensitive to destruction of riverine habitat . ''

1830s in France
Gordon Muortat Mayen Maborjok ( 1922–2008 ) was a South Sudanese veteran politician and an advocate for the rights and freedom of the South Sudanese people . They were the President of the Nile Provisional Government ( NPG ) which led Anyanya I ; Southern Sudan 's first armed resistance to Khartoum which started in 1955 . Muortat also served as Vice-President of the Southern Front ( SF ) and Foreign Minister in the Southern Sudan Provisional Government ( SSPG ) .
Early life
Gordon Muortat Mayen was from Dinka tribe from
karagok village and was born in 1922 at Karagok village 10 miles South East of Rumbek . Their father was a local chief of Patiop Clan of the Agar Dinka . Muortat was educated at Akot elementary from 1936 to 1942 . They then attended Loka Nugent Junior Secondary School in Western Equatoria from 1942 to 1945 . In 1951 they were among the first Southern Sudanese to graduate from Sudan Police College and was commissioned to police inspector where they rose through the ranks to become Chief Inspector of Police .
Political career
In 1957 , Muortat was denied a transfer to the Southern Sudan , so they resigned their position and joined the Sudan Civil Administration . They were appointed assistant district commissioner and served in many places in the Bahr el-Ghazal and Upper Nile provinces . In 1965 , under the transitional government of Prime Minister Sirr Al-Khatim Al-Khalifa , Muortat was appointed to be Minister of Works and Mineral Resources in their cabinet . However , when Prime Minister Muhammad Ahmad Mahjub came to office , Muortat was dismissed .
In 1964 , Gordon Muortat became one of the founders of the Southern Front ( SF ) , a political party that would represent the rights of the people of Southern Sudan . They headed the Southern Front delegation in the Round Table Conference between the South and North in 1965 and is remembered for demanding that the South be given the right to self-determination . They held this view due to the fact that Southern Sudanese were not involved in the politics which led to the so-called independence of the Sudan from the colonial power in 1956 . They therefore argued that South Sudanese must be given the right to determine their political future in a referendum , to be carried out in the South which should be supervised and monitored internationally . This view was also shared by other members of the Southern Front , namely Clement Mboro , Bona Malwal and Hilary Paul Logali . The great massacres of Juba , Wau and all over the South that were carried out by the Sudanese army in July 1965 convinced Gordon Muortat that the Northern Arab rulers were not interested in the peaceful resolution of the 'South Sudan Question ' . Thus in August 1965 at the meeting of the Southern Front executive committee , they proposed that the party should be dissolved and that the entire committee should move into exile with the objective of merging with the Anyanya political and military wings .
Rebel leader
Anyanya One
Muortat joined the Anyanya 1 insurgency , fighting in the First Sudanese Civil War to liberate the territories of Southern Sudan in 1967 and was appointed foreign minister in the Southern Sudan Provisional Government ( SSPG ) under Aggrey Jaden . After the collapse of the SSPG due to internal political wrangling , the second Anya-Nya One government , the Nile Provisional Government ( NPG ) was formed . Gordon Muortat Mayen was elected unanimously as president , with their army fighting a fully fledged war against the north , advocating for the complete independence of the South . During this time , Southern Sudan was renamed the Nile Republic with its citizens being referred to as Nileans . The name Southern Sudan was rejected by Muortat and their government due to the name being just a reference to a geographic zone which has little relevance to the people of the Southern Sudan . It is also a name which was used by colonial powers to inadequately describe the Nilotic and Nilo-Hamitic tribes living on the upper region of the river Nile , first by the Egyptians , and later by the British . Dr. John Garang de Mabior , future leader of the SPLA , was among the batches of Muortat 's soldiers sent to Israel for military training under the NPG .
The NPG was dissolved in 1970 , after the failure to restore Israeli arms shipments to their forces . The weapons were instead being diverted to Joseph Lagu who formed the Southern Sudan Liberation Movement ( SSLM ) in January 1971 after staging a successful coup d'état against Muortat and their rebel government . At the time , Andrew Makur Thou , commander of the Anyanya forces under the NPG was willing to continue to fight under Muortat 's leadership and quell the coup attempt , however Gordon Muortat declined . In a 1999 interview , Muortat , talking on the dissolution of the NPG stated , `` I went to the bush in order to fight for the liberation of the South Sudan . And since Lagu had managed to secure arms for the liberation of our people , I did not see any reason to continue with a parallel struggle . So I decided to stand down . Because it is my belief that South Sudan can not be liberated from the Arabs unless all of the Africans in the South unite and fight as one people , for one goal , the independence of South Sudan '' . They encouraged all loyal forces to join Lagu and continue the fight against the Arab dominated government in the North . While Muortat was leader of the Southern movement , they declined offers of ceasefire with Khartoum as they were not willing to accept the terms Gaafar Nimeiry was offering ; local autonomy for the region of Southern Sudan . They were only willing to enter peace talks if the succession of Southern Sudan was on the agenda . Shortly after Joseph Lagu had taken over power as the leader of the movement , the SSLM under Lagu , entered peace negotiations with Khartoum to form the Addis Ababa Agreement which accepted regional autonomy for the South .
In 1971 , Gordon Muortat was elected president of the African National Front , which was one of the southern factions that were against the Addis Ababa negotiations and did not actively participate in them , however they sent a clear message to negotiators on how proceedings could move . This included ; that talks ought to be held between North and Southern true Representatives i.e . those mandated and not opportunists acting on complicity with the Arabs and their agents . Talks ought to take place without any pre-condition like the Arabs imposition of Local Autonomy . The talks ought to take place under the auspices of impartial organisations like the UN or the OAU . The Arabs must know that what they are now committing in Addis Ababa will never help in defeating the Southern Sudan . However , despite this , the Addis Ababa peace agreement was signed in 1972 . Gordon Muortat did not agree with the contents and terms of the agreement , calling it a sell out and fraudulent . They believed that the Southern people were not given the chance to self-determination and a return to civil war will be needed in order for South Sudanese to achieve their true unalienable rights . They continued the protest against the agreement and remained in exile moving to the UK .
Anyanya Patriotic Front
During the period of peace after the 1972 agreement , the former Ayna-nya rebels were absorbed into the Sudanese army , however many were discontented , and some chose to return to the bush in 1975 and headed to Ethiopia . In 1975 , Gordon Muortat along with the other Southern Sudanese politicians in exile , formed the Anyanya Patriotic Front , a liberation movement with the same aims as SSPG , NPG and the first Anyanya ; to liberate the South as a separate country from the North . Muortat was elected as the President of the movement , other notable high-profile southern politicians that formed the APF were Elia Duang Arop ; the movement 's Secretary General and former minister in the NPG , Francis Mayar Akoon , Agolong Chol and many others who had disapproved of the Addis Ababa Agreement . The Ethiopian government agreed to station the mutineers , which formed the military wing of the APF , in a camp called Bilpam , which later became the first full-fledged SPLA battalion in 1984 . Gordon Muortat and their group went on to assist organising the few thousand strong , majority Nuer troops in Bilpam , amongst the troops were the Late Vincent Kuany Latjor , Pagan Amum and Deng Alor . Later on the Late Samuel Gai Tut also joined the rebellion . A BBC reporter mistakenly labelled the Anya-nya Patriotic Front as Anyanya two , knowing that the movement was the continuation of the first Anya-nya one movement , However , Muortat denounced the splinter group that went on to fight with the SPLA that also became known as Anyanya II because they deviated from the original ideals of the APF . The new movement , the APF was confronted with many difficulties , launched as a genuine separatist movement to liberate the South Sudan and establish an independent African State , Muortat and the politicians heading it were not ready to entertain any ambiguous directives from their hosts and get dragged into the Communist demagoguery . As a result , the Ethiopian government dismissed them in refusing to provide financial and logistical support . The lack of financial and logistical support , as it was not forthcoming from anywhere , eventually led to their dissolution . Gordon Muortat however , had opened up a line requesting arms from Col. Muammar Ghaddafi 's Libya . Due to Libya 's fractured relations with the Khartoum government , they were willing to assist . The arms were pledged to the movement in Southern Sudan and Muortat gave their blessing for the SPLA , who later took up arms against Khartoum , to make good on this offer .
As Muortat had predicted the Addis-Ababa agreement did not live long . Resource infringements and marginalisation of the South by the North led to increased unrest in the South . In 1983 President Gaafar Nimeiry declared all Sudan an Islamic state under Shari ' a law , including the non-Islamic majority southern region , forcing southerners once again to take to the bush for the second struggle for the liberation of the Sudan , this time under Late Dr. John Garang .
Gordon Muortat 's leadership and resolve were the driving force that continued armed liberation revival in Southern Sudan . Also inspiring many other South Sudanese politicians and students ' organizations involved in the liberation struggle , notably the SOSSA and NAM . Despite their lengthy period of exile in Europe , Gordon Muortat remained an influential figure in South Sudanese politics . As a revered figure , their residence in London served as the Mecca for many South Sudanese political leaders of various political stripes and viewpoints in the 1980s and 1990s .
In 1994 Gordon Muortat was appointed as Personal Advisor to the SPLM/SPLA Chairman Dr. John Garang de Mabior and a member of the National Liberation Council . They participated in the Machakos peace talks in Kenya in 2004 with the government of Sudan . At the talks they insistently warned the SPLM delegates to learn from the experience of the Addis Ababa Agreement in 1972 .
Later life and death
From 2006 and onwards , Muortat became an MP in the South Sudan Legislative Council representing their constituency in Rumbek . In their inaugural speech to the SSLA they reiterated their concerns about the length of the CPA and on tribalism . On 12 April 2008 , Muortat died from natural causes while on a recess from parliament-having achieved so much in their life . They were very proud of the SPLA/M achievements especially that the road to the realisation of the Southerner 's freedom was within sight . Gordon Muortat was given a state funeral and was laid to rest at Rumbek Freedom Square , attended by thousands of citizens who had come to pay their last respects to a man who was remembered by many as a freedom fighter and defender of the rights of the people of South Sudan . Notable speakers at the occasion were President Salva Kiir Mayardit , Abel Alier ; former Vice President of the Republic of Sudan and President of the defunct High Executive Council for Southern Sudan , Isaiah Kulang Mabor , Madam Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior , Mr. Andrew Makur Thou , Mr . Bona Malual , Mr. Clement Wani Konga and Mr. Daniel Awet Akot , then governor of Lakes State . In their address to the mourning citizens of the South Sudanese town of Rumbek , the President of the Republic of South Sudan , Gen. Salva Kiir Mayardit , reminded the people of the selfless leader , who spent all their life struggling for the cause of the people of South Sudan . `` It is now up to us , the present generation to transform Hon . Gordon 's dreams into a reality , after achieving the Comprehensive Peace Agreement where the right to Self Determination for the people of South Sudan is enshrined , '' stated the President . President Kiir declared 3 days of state mourning and all the flags in Lakes State fly at half mast .
Legacy
Muortat is widely praised by South Sudanese from all tribes due to their impartialness , their strong stance against tribalism and their vision of seeing Southerners united as equals . They are also greatly respected for their constant and consistent stance against the Khartoum regimes and their lack of compromise regardless of what they were offered by the Sudanese governments . Especially during the period after the Addis Ababa Agreement where they were under self-imposed exile due to their refusal to participate in the Southern Sudanese autonomous government under Nimeiri which they saw as unjust and a sell-out . They encouraged the idea of a continued struggle while many other Southern leaders and politicians embraced the peace and saw the military struggle as over . Their stance gave hope to many Southerners who were becoming increasingly disillusioned by the Addis Ababa Agreement and the government . During this time was they expelled from many African countries by their government 's such as Zaire and Uganda , due to their unwillingness to be seen as nations that are hosting such a high-profile rebel against the Khartoum government . Muortat was finally granted asylum by the UK after these expulsions .
They are survived by their wife Sarah Piath Ahoc , 10 children and 27 grandchildren and one great grandchild .
In their memory , the Gordon Muortat Mayen Foundation has been set up , which seeks to help the people of South Sudan through various schemes and projects .

Parnavaz II ( ) ( died 30 BC ) , of the Artaxiad Dynasty , was a king of Iberia ( Kartli , eastern Georgia ) from 63 to 30 BC . They are known as Pharnabazus in Classical sources , and is commonly identified with the Bartom or Bratman of the medieval Georgian chronicles .
They succeeded upon the death of their father Artag who had been defeated by the Roman general Pompey in 65 BC . However , Roman hegemony over Iberia proved to be impermanent , and , in 36 BC , the legate Publius Canidius Crassus led their army into Iberia , forcing Parnavaz to make an alliance against Zober , king of neighboring Albania . Canidius and Parnavaz marched to Albania and subdued its people . Incidentally , no Georgian source documents these events reported by Cassius Dio in their Roman History Instead , the Georgian annals concentrates upon the homecoming of Mirvan , the exiled son of Parnajom , who had been brought up in Iran . Mirvan returned to Kartli at the head of an Iranian army , killed Bartom and became a king .
Bartom is said to have adopted Kartam , the descendant of Kuji ( the alleged ruler of Egrisi in the time of the first Iberian king Parnavaz ) . But Kartam had also been killed in battle against Mirvan . Nevertheless , Kartam 's pregnant wife – the daughter of Bartom – fled to Armenia where they gave birth to a son named Aderki .

Karl S. Rosengren is an American psychologist , academic , author and researcher . They are a Professor with a joint appointment in the Brain and Cognitive Science Department and the Psychology Department at the University of Rochester .
Rosengren 's research falls into areas encompassing developmental psychology , motor development , and cognitive science . They have authored several books and monographs including Research Methods : From Theory to Practice , Children 's Understanding of Death : Toward a Contextualized and Integrated Account , Evolution Challenges : Integrating Research and Practice in Teaching and Learning about Evolution , and Imagining the Impossible : Magical , Scientific , and Religious Thinking in Children .
Rosengren is a Fellow of Association for Psychological Science .
Education
Rosengren received their Bachelor 's degree in Chemistry with Minors in Mathematics and Psychology from the College of Wooster in 1981 . They then enrolled at the University of Minnesota and earned their Doctoral degree in Child Psychology in 1989 .
Career
Following their Post-doctoral fellowship , Rosengren held a brief appointment as an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan before joining the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1992 as Assistant Professor of Kinesiology , and Psychology . In 1998 , they held joint appointments as an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology , the Department of Kinesiology , and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology . Rosengren was promoted to Full Professor in these Departments in 2004 . In 2008 , they accepted a position as a Visiting Professor in the Department of Psychology at Northwestern University before joining that department as a Professor of Psychology . In 2014 , Rosengren became a Professor in the Department of Psychology , and an Investigator at Waisman Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . In 2019 they joined University of Rochester and held appointments as a Professor in the Brain and Cognitive Science Department and the Psychology Department .
Rosengren also held a variety of administrative appointments in their career . At Northwestern University , they served as the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Psychology , as Vice-Chair of Social-Behavioral Institutional Review Board till 2014 . They also served on Northwestern 's Undergraduate Research Grant Committee , a committee that funded undergraduate research . They served as the chair of this committee during their last 3 years at Northwestern , for which they were honored with the establishment of the Karl Rosengren Undergraduate Mentoring Award given annually to a faculty member for their excellence in mentoring undergraduate research .
Research
Rosengren has worked extensively on two areas of research : children 's cognitive development and motor development , and control across the life span . In their research , they have regarded humans as complex systems and investigated how multiple factors ( both internal and external to the individual ) interact and influence the current state of behavior .
Cognitive development
Rosengren explored conceptual processes that enable individuals to endorse seemingly inconsistent epistemologies , discussed secularization hypothesis , and highlighted the work of Eugene Subbotsky and Piaget in this context . They also conducted a study to demonstrate how symbolic relations can be quite challenging for young children . In 1994 , they investigated children 's magical explanations and beliefs , and found out that majority of 4-year-olds perceive magic as a plausible mechanism , but magical explanations for certain real world events violate their causal expectations . They co-edited a book entitled Imaging the Impossible : Magical , Scientific , and Religious Thinking in Children , based on the development of human thinking that goes beyond the ordinary boundaries of reality . David Shih reviewed the book as containing `` many informative chapters '' , and `` discussions of high academic caliber on various aspects , such as magical thinking , how children 's religious beliefs differ from adults , empirical and metaphysical questions used by children ... ''
Motor development and control
Rosengren 's work in this area focused on the development and control of balance and walking across the life span . They conducted research on balance control in children , and determined the age at which the integration of sensory information in unperturbed stance in children is comparable to that of adults . They along with co-authors introduced new methods to improve quantitative assessment of human movement , and described their characteristics and advantages . Furthermore , they demonstrated the reliability of COP measures of quiet standing , and developed an optimal measurement protocol using the tools of Generalizability Theory ( G-Theory ) .
Interaction of cognitive and motor development
Rosengren also examined how cognitive and motor factors interact in the performance of every task . This work focused primarily on two tasks : children 's drawings and young children 's action errors . In the drawing domain , they explored how cognitive and biomechanical constraints influence children 's drawing production . With respect to action errors , attempts by young children to perform actions not afforded by the context they are in ( e.g. , attempting to sit in a tiny chair or grasp an object in a photograph ) they have used a wide range of methods ( lab-based experimental studies , observational studies in preschools , prospective parental diary studies , and retrospective parental reports ) to explore the contexts where these behaviors occur .

Giovanni Marliani was an Italian physicist , doctor , philosopher and astrologer who was born and lived during the Late Medieval period in northern Italy . Marliani specialised in many mathematical fields and lectured on the phenomenon of natural body heat . They were known for experiments attempting to empirically prove that hot water freezes faster than cold water . ( The phenomenon known today as the Mpemba effect . )
Biography
Born in Milan , Lombardy , in 1420 , Giovanni Marliani was the son of a Milanese noble , Cantello Marliani . Marliani studied medicine in Pavia under the tutelage of Biagio Pelacani of Parma . Giovanni Marliani became a doctor in 1440 and went on to the Milanese College of Physics where they taught medicine , philosophy , astrology and physics for most of their life . In 1452 , Marliani returned to Pavia after some time in the Milanese Studio . They were paid 425 florins every three months by the Duke of Milan , Francesco Sforza . With a change in the ruling class of Milan , Marliani 's family , who were traditionally Ghibellines ( against Papal rule ) gained more prestige under the Sforza dynasty . In 1450 , they were given a title by the Milanese administration .
After the death of F. Sforza , Galeazzo Maria took over their dealings . Giovanni Marliani was in debt because of their large family . Castello Marliani , their father , was nominated for an award in 1450 ; the 'Razionale della Camera delle entrate Straordinarie ad Laborerios ' . However , their father died a year later . Giovanni Marliani was invited by King Ferdinand of Naples to teach in 1467 . Their pay rose to 1,000 florins a year , which was the highest known salary of its kind . Marliani specialised in Mathematics ( de Minutiis ) , Fractions ( scienta de ponderibus ) Velocity , Statistics , and disseminated physics and Medieval logic . 1482 was the height of Marliani 's career , during which they attended to the needs of high-profile dignitaries who were associates and allies of the Sforza family .
Giovanni Marliani died in 1483 and was buried in Santa Maria delle Grazie church in Milan during the reign of Ludovico il Moro . Leonardo da Vinci is known to have studied Marliani 's science publications thoroughly , although they did not always agree with their findings . All of Marliani 's assets were passed down to their son Daniele . In 1457 , their son was given enough land by the Duke to conduct falconry .
Work
In the scientific community , there was a debate about how objects cooled and in 1461 Marliani confirmed that they had experimentally observed hot water freezing faster than cold water . In their experiment they stated that they had used four ounces of unheated water and four ounces of boiled water , which they placed in similar containers outside on a cold winter 's day . They eventually observed that the boiled water froze first ; although they were unable to explain the mechanics of how it happened . Marliani also lectured on the quantities and production of natural body heat . They partly accepted the theory of Giovanni da Sermoneta , who stated that the temperature of the human body stayed constant throughout the seasons . However , Marliani maintained that human body temperature is higher during the winter than in summer .
Marliani was the subject of Marshall Clagett 's thesis , entitled `` Giovanni Marliani and late medieval physics '' . Clagett became interested in Marliani after encountering reproductions of their works from their mentor at Columbia University , Lynn Thorndike .

Diptychophora galvani is a species of moth in the family Crambidae . It measures about one centimeter in wingspan and is easily distinguished from all closely-related species by the color pattern of its forewings . These are orange at their base and tip with a large intermediate gray patch , a pattern not found in any other species of Diptychophora . The female has grayish hindwings , while they are entirely white in the male . The genitalia of both male and female are also quite different from other members of this genus . The biology of the species remains completely unknown , including the host plant of the larval stage , although some species of the tribe Diptychophorini are known to feed on mosses .
Diptychophora galvani is known only from Brazil , where it was collected in the states of Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais , at altitude . There it inhabits the Cerrado ecoregion , consisting of gallery forests and savannahs , with a dry season . It was collected for the first time in 1982 by Vitor O. Becker , but its description by Bernard Landry and Becker was published only in 2021 . Its specific epithet , galvani , pays tribute to Ricardo Galvão , a Brazilian physicist who headed the National Institute for Space Research of Brazil and was dismissed in 2019 for publicly opposing the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro , a notorious climate change denier . The latter had claimed that data produced by the institute demonstrating the substantial increase in Amazonian forest deforestation following their rise to power , including devastating fires in 2019 , were false . The descriptors of the species dedicate the species to Galvão for `` his courage in the face of professional adversity '' , but also because the color of the butterfly 's wings recalls that of forest fires . The moth is named `` species of the year 2022 of the Swiss Systematics Society '' .
Taxonomy
The species Diptychophora galvani was described by Bernard Landry and Vitor O. Becker in 2021 based on specimens collected by Becker in 1982 , 1983 , and 1986 . The type series includes two females ( including the holotype ) and two males . The two females and a male are deposited in Becker 's personal collection ( collecting event numbers 106575 , 49809 , and 49079 ) , and a male ( MHNG-ENTO-84604 ) from the type locality is deposited in the Natural History Museum of Geneva , Switzerland . Two other Brazilian species of Diptychophora , D. planaltina and D. ardalia , were described in the same publication .
The name of the genus Diptychophora comes from the ancient Greek and means `` which bears two folds '' , possibly in reference to the two constrictions on the termen of the forewing , near the apex , a character that was given as diagnostic in the original description of the genus by the German entomologist Philipp Christoph Zeller .
The species epithet galvani refers to Ricardo Galvão , a physicist and former director of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research ( INPE ) . Galvão opposed the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro when the latter claimed – in a public international press conference – that the 2019 data provided by INPE , on the substantial increase of deforestation in the Amazon forest since Bolsonaro 's election in 2018 , were false . Certain of the correctness and quality of the data , as Director of INPE , Galvão stood up and challenged Bolsonaro to prove their assertion in a face-to-face discussion . The challenge was not accepted and Galvão was fired from the INPE 's directorship . The physicist then received the support of the scientific community , the journal Nature placing them among the [ [ Nature 's 10|Nature '' 's 10 ] ] `` people who mattered in science '' in 2019 for their defence of science against the attacks of the Brazilian government , and the American Association for the Advancement of Science awarded them their 2021 Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award . The descriptors of Diptychophora galvani dedicated the species to Galvão for `` his courage in the face of professional adversity '' , but also because the colors of the moth 's forewings are reminiscent of the devastating Amazon rainforest wildfires that were demonstrated by the INPE data .
Description Diptychophora galvani measures in wingspan , with forewings long in the male and in the female . The species is easily distinguished from all other closely related species of the genus Diptychophora by the remarkable pattern of its forewings . These have two large orange areas , one distal ( at the wing tip ) and one proximal ( at the base of the wing ) , the latter bordered with thick dark brown lines . These two orange areas are separated by a large gray median ( middle ) section . The hindwings are white in males and grayish in females .
Regarding the genitalia of the male , the elongated uncus that is fused with the tegumen is a unique diagnostic character . In the female , the copulatory bursa is adorned with two sclerotized elements ( the signa bursae ) – one of which is very large and crescent- or boomerang-shaped , while the other is small , elongated-rounded , and folded . This morphology is not found in any other species of the genus Diptychophora .
Ecology
The specimens available for the description of the species were attracted to light at night with a mercury-vapor lamp . Diptychophora galvani is known only from the adult stage . No hostplant is known , as is the case for all of the species of Diptychophora . The only available information on the pabulum of the caterpillars in the tribe Diptychophorini concerns three species of the genus Glaucocharis in New Zealand that feed on mosses .
Distribution and habitat Diptychophora galvani was described from the Brazilian municipality of Chapada dos Guimarães , in Mato Grosso , where it was collected at an elevation of ; the type series also includes specimens from Unaí , in Minas Gerais , which were found at an elevation of . The habitat of the species is the Cerrado , a major ecoregion of Brazil located between the Amazonian forest and the Atlantic forest . The region is characterized by a seasonal drought and is composed of more or less wooded savannas , humid zones , and gallery forests , on poor acidic soils . The known specimens of Diptychophora galvani were collected alongside gallery forests .
In the culture
In February 2022 , Diptychophora galvani '' is named `` species of the year 2022 of the Swiss Systematics Society '' , among 158 species described by taxonomists based in Switzerland during the year 2021 .

Norman Morrison ( December 29 , 1933 – November 2 , 1965 ) was a Baltimore Quaker best known for their act of self-immolation at age 31 to protest United States involvement in the Vietnam War . The Erie , Pennsylvania-born Morrison graduated from the College of Wooster in 1956 . They were married and had two daughters and a son . On November 2 , 1965 , Morrison doused themselves in kerosene and set themselves on fire below Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara 's Pentagon office . This action may have been taken after Thích Quảng Đức and other Buddhist monks , who burned themselves to death to protest the repression committed by the South Vietnam government of Catholic President Ngo Dinh Diem .
Death
Morrison took their daughter Emily , then one year of age , to the Pentagon , and either set them down or handed them off to someone in the crowd before setting themselves ablaze . Morrison 's reasons for taking Emily are not entirely known . However , Morrison 's wife Anne Welsh later recalled , `` Whether they thought of it that way or not , I think having Emily with them was a final and great comfort to Norman ... [ S ] he was a powerful symbol of the children we were killing with our bombs and napalm – who did n't have parents to hold them in their arms . ''
In a letter they mailed to Welsh , Morrison reassured them of the faith in their act . `` Know that I love thee ... but I must go to help the children of the priest 's village '' . McNamara described Morrison 's death as `` a tragedy not only for their family but also for me and the country . It was an outcry against the killing that was destroying the lives of so many Vietnamese and American youth . '' They were survived by Anne Welsh and three children , Ben ( who died of cancer in 1976 ) , Christina and Emily .
Legacy
Morrison was seen as devout and sincere in sacrificing themselves for a cause greater than himself . In Vietnam , Morrison quickly became a folk hero to some , their name rendered as Mo Ri Xon . Five days after Morrison died , Vietnamese poet Tố Hữu wrote a poem , `` Emily , My Child '' , assuming the voice of Morrison addressing their daughter Emily and telling them the reasons for their sacrifice .
One week after Morrison , Roger Allen LaPorte performed a similar act in New York City , in front of the United Nations building . On May 9 , 1967 , as part of the start to the 1967 Pentagon camp-in , demonstrators held a vigil for Morrison , before occupying the Pentagon for four days until being removed and arrested .
Morrison 's widow , Anne , and the couple 's two daughters visited Vietnam in 1999 , where they met with Tố Hữu , the poet who had written the popular poem Emily , My Child . Anne Morrison Welsh recounts the visit and their husband 's tragedy in their monograph , Fire of the Heart : Norman Morrison 's Legacy In Vietnam And At Home .
On their visit to the United States in 2007 , President of Vietnam Nguyễn Minh Triết visited a site on the Potomac near the place where Morrison immolated themselves and read the poem by Tố Hữu to commemorate Morrison .
Cultural depictions
Filmmaker Errol Morris interviewed Secretary McNamara at length on camera in their documentary film , The Fog of War , in which McNamara says , `` [ Morrison ] came to the Pentagon , doused themselves with gasoline . Burned themselves to death below my office ... their wife issued a very moving statement – 'human beings must stop killing other human beings ' – and that 's a belief that I shared , I shared it then , I believe it even more strongly today '' . McNamara then posits , `` How much evil must we do in order to do good ? We have certain ideals , certain responsibilities . Recognize that at times you will have to engage in evil , but minimize it . ''
Perhaps the most detailed treatment of Morrison 's death appears in The Living and the Dead : Robert McNamara and Five Lives of a Lost War , by prizewinning author Paul Hendrickson , published in 1997 .
Morrison 's widow Anne Welsh appears , with their young children , in a segment of the French documentary , Far from Vietnam , in which they calmly describe the circumstances of their husband 's death and expresses approval of their act . This footage is interspersed with an interview with a Vietnamese expatriate , Ann Uyen , living in Paris , who describes what Morrison 's sacrifice meant to the Vietnamese people .
Morrison 's immolation is portrayed in the HBO film Path to War , in which they are portrayed by Victor Slezak .
Morrison is the subject of a poem by Amy Clampitt called `` The Dahlia Gardens '' in their 1983 book The Kingfisher .
The incident inspired George Starbuck 's poem Of Late .
A play by Canadian playwright Sean Devine , Re : Union , imagines a meeting between Morrison 's daughter Emily and Robert McNamara . The play was published by Scirocco Drama in 2013 .
Memorials
In the Vietnamese city of Đà Nẵng , a road is named after Norman Morrison in memory of their act against American involvement in South Vietnam . Parallel to it also is a road named after Francis Henry Loseby .
North Vietnam named a Hanoi street after him , and issued a postage stamp in their honor . Possession of the stamp was prohibited in the United States due to the U.S. embargo against North Vietnam .

Vrio Corp. ( formerly DirecTV Latin America LLC ; stylized as Vгio ) is an American company that manages the commercial operations of the Latin American branch of DirecTV ( mostly known as DirecTV Latin America ) . It is owned by Grupo Werthein . It produces TV content , and owns several TV channels .
As of 2018 , DirecTV Latin America 's legal name was changed to Vrio Corp .
History
In 1994 , Hughes Electronics Corporation and Venezuelan media company Grupo Cisneros create a joint venture named Galaxy Latin America , a company intended to distribute DirecTV services in 27 Latin American countries , initially with an offer of 144 channels . In that same year , it enters the Chilean market and then it was launched in Mexico .
In 2000 , Galaxy Latin America LLC was renamed as DirecTV Latin America LLC .
In 2005 , Grupo Cisneros sold its 14 % stake on DirecTV Latin America to The DirecTV Group Inc .
While in Mexico and Brazil it merged with rival Sky and disappeared , in South America it absorbed Sky as the latter struggled in the market .
On 19 January 2016 , the Secretary of Environment of Bogotá , sanctioned DirecTV 's Colombian subsidiary , Directv Colombia Ltda. , with a sum of $ 118 million for placing advertisement without the proper permission from the city . The company violated Decree 959 , published in 2000 , that regulates where companies can place public publicity .
On 15 September 2017 , Reuters reported that AT & T , the owner of DirecTV 's U.S. and Latin American divisions , had hired an advisor to consider offering DirecTV Latin America on the public stock market . The principal motive was cited as the need to reduce the debt load AT & T would assume if it took over Time Warner as planned . Since that date , the U.S. Dept . of Justice filed suit to block that acquisition on antitrust grounds , a trial is scheduled to start on 19 March 2018 before Judge Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , and a decision is not expected before June–July . However , even if the deal is blocked , AT & T might dispose of the division as not core to its business . On 19 April 2018 , the IPO was cancelled .
On 19 May 2020 , the company ceased operations in Venezuela , due to US sanctions against pro-Maduro TV channels Globovisión and PDVSA TV in 2019 . These channels require mandatory transmission imposed by the telecommunications commission of Venezuela , CONATEL , while the US sanctions simultaneously block the transmission of these channels .
On 21 July 2021 , AT & T Latin America announced that they will sell Vrio to Grupo Werthein , which will include all DirecTV operations in Latin America and SKY Brasil ( while keeping the broadband operations in Colombia and their stake at Sky México ) . The sale was completed on 16 November 2021 .
Subsidiaries
Chile
The Chilean subsidiary of DirecTV has operated in the country since 1994 . It bought Sky Chile and absorbed it into its operations . It signed an agreement with GTD Manquehue to offer full telephone , television , and internet services throughout the country .
During the second quarter of 2011 , the company was positioned as the second fastest growing pay TV company in Chile , registering 23.8 % of the total market .
In 2012 , the company led the pay TV market with an 18.7 % market share .
Between 2012 and 2015 , DirecTV Chile received the `` Consumer Loyalty '' award NPS .
Between December 2012 and March 2013 , the company was consolidated as the first paid television company that has grown the most in the country .
Between 2011 and 2016 , DirecTV Chile received the National Customer Satisfaction Award ProCalidad as the best pay TV service .
In 2012 , it made an agreement with Club Deportivo Universidad Católica to carry the brand name DirecTV on their jerseys . In 2015 , it made an agreement with Colo-Colo to also carry the DirecTV logo .

Squash mosaic virus ( SqMV ) is a mosaic virus disease common in squash plants and other plants , including melons , of the family Cucurbitaceae . It occurs worldwide . It is transmitted primarily by beetles , including the leaf beetle ( Acalymma trivittata ) , spotted cucumber beetle ( Diabrotica undecimpunctata ) , and 28-spotted ladybird beetle ( Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata ) , as well as some other beetles . Plants are infected by the saliva expelled by the beetles as they feed upon the plant . The beetles acquire the virus by feeding upon an infected plant and can retain the virus in their bodies for up to 20 days . Unlike some other mosaic viruses that infect squashes , SqMV is not spread by aphids . In melons it can be spread by seeds . The results are dark green mosaic , blistering , vein clearing , yellowing of leaves , and hardening . Symptoms include `` pronounced chlorotic mottle , green veinbanding , and distortion of leaves '' . Fruits of infected plants are also affected , becoming mottled and misshaped . There are two strains of this virus : strain 1 has a greater effect on melons than squash while the opposite is true of strain 2 .
SqMV affects all cucurbits ( family Cucurbitaceae ) and some genera of Hydrophyllaceae , Leguminosae , and Umbelliferae , except that most isolates do not affect watermelons . SqMV and cucumber mosaic virus ( CMV ) are the most common viruses among cucurbits , with CMV being the more common of the two . Kendrick is credited with discovering SqMV in 1934 , though McClintock may have discovered it in 1916 when they described a highly similar virus , calling it `` cucumber virus '' .
